		<p>The clock, as they say, is ticking.<br />
In a few short hours, the last few seconds of 1999 will disappear somewhere just off the coast of New Zealand, and we&#8217;ll start to find out what we&#8217;re in for. Some believe it&#8217;s the end of the world, others believe it&#8217;s the end of our civilisation, and others believe it&#8217;s the end of the year. (Allison thinks that maniacs who spell &#8220;civilization&#8221; *incorrectly* (see the *correct* British spelling in the previous sentence) will be the death of us.)<br />
I believe it&#8217;s the beginning of the future.<br />
Sure, we may lose power for a few hours if something goes wrong, but that&#8217;s not going to wipe us all out. Rather, it&#8217;ll be the militants running amuck with a few tonnes of nitroglycerine. They&#8217;re the ones creeping me out. In many ways, I&#8217;m quite glad I&#8217;m sitting here in Nanaimo, away from the big cities. The worst that could happen is that I get stranded here when BC Ferries shuts down due to some unforseen navigation problem.<br />
Predictions are in order for such an auspicious occasion, and I find it hard to pass them up. So here&#8217;s what I think will happen tonight:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few places will lose power, either by some poor programming, by complete fluke, or through some maniac&#8217;s planning</li>
<li>Several thousand people will at some point lose their lives (this will come true regardless of what happens, based purely on the human death rate); whether this number spikes due to artificial designs (see the above-mentioned maniac) remains to be seen &#8212; expect several deaths due to drunk drivers</li>
<li>Hospitals around the world will be deluged by people convinced the world is going to end; there may also be a rush if the above artifical spike occurs</li>
<li>The banks will go on, as will your bank balances</li>
<li>Your computer will still start in the morning, provided you have electricity</li>
</ul>
<p>And my most Earth-shattering prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll all be disappointed when nothing happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave it to the media to psyche this New Year&#8217;s way out of proportion, including the addition of the moniker &#8220;Millennium&#8221;. This is NOT the new Millennium, folks &#8212; that&#8217;s next year. (Don&#8217;t believe me? Answer this question: Was there a Year 0? Answer: No. Result, the decades actually *end* with &#8216;0&#8217;, such as 1950, 1970, and yes, 2000.)<br />
Oh yes, and unless Nostradamus&#8217; predictions come true in the next 24 hours (and I doubt they will [insert sound of me knocking on wood]), there will be no Earth-shattering earthquake that sends us BCers into the drink. (If not, I&#8217;ll have a *really* good story for you in about 24 hours or so.)<br />
So, with that, I leave you to the Most Overblown Festivities of the past Millennium (and yes, that you can actually bank on &#8212; there won&#8217;t be anything worse than this year), and I hope to see you all in the New Year.<br />
Provided the Earth doesn&#8217;t end, of course.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, another Christmas has come and (almost) gone. It was an unusual Christmas for me, mostly because things have changed. My family is bigger than it was, and I&#8217;ve got a few more traditions to start remembering.<br />
The first of these traditions is waking up at 8:00am. Around here, Christmas starts a bit earlier than in Oakville. This is primarily due to Mr. Collins, who was up at 5:00am, waiting for Christmas to begin. His energy certainly makes Christmas interesting.<br />
Collins Christmases are big events &#8230; much bigger than Sowrey Christmases (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with either of them). Waking up to a Collins Christmas means wading through to some place on the couch where you can spend a comfortable hour or two unwrapping presents. It reminds me of my childhood (no doubt in part to Mr. Collins&#8217; enthusiasm).<br />
Even the practice of opening a gift on Christmas Eve continues here. It&#8217;s a practice we Sowreys gave up a few years ago (I don&#8217;t even remember when), so it was a little strange to open a gift last night. But it really prepares you for the next morning.<br />
Generousity is the word around here. In fact, &#8220;give until it hurts&#8221; comes to mind. Over the course of the past 14 hours, I have received the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 CD: Harry Connick Jr. &#8211; When My Heart Finds Christmas (from my parents)</li>
<li>1 DVD: Saving Private Randy Special Edition (from the Collins)</li>
<li>1 Penguin Shaker (I&#8217;ll get back to this in a moment)</li>
<li>2 packs: Ferrero Rocher (3 chocolates to a pack) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Terry&#8217;s Chocolate Orange (Collins)</li>
<li>1 stick: deodorant (Collins)</li>
<li>2 rolls: 100 ASA film (Collins)</li>
<li>1 CD: Will Smith &#8211; Willennium (from Jane)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Sweet Story Book (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Night Before Christmas (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: Tom Clancy &#8211; Net Force (from my Nana)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shampoo (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shower gel (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bar: glycerine soap (Collins)</li>
<li>1 train whistle (sounds like a real whistle, too!) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Reach toothbrush (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Orange Crush(R) candy cane (Collins)</li>
<li>1 homemade orange bath balm/bomb (Collins)</li>
<li>1 feather duster (I think this was a hint) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Hershey Chocolate Storybook (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: The Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Personal Finance in your 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s for Canadians (from my sister)</li>
<li>1 book: The World Encyclopedia of Beer (from Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: beige with striping (Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: light green (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: button-down plaid (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: funky psychedelic black and white (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Motorcycle racing (from the Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 set: bar tools, including bottle opener and corkscrew (from the Vailmonts)</li>
</ul>
<p>That was just me. (Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad we brought the car.) Oh, and before your eyes bug out from the length of the above list, I would like to direct you to one little detail: a lot of the stuff on that list is &#8220;small&#8221; stuff, such as candy and books.<br />
Then there was the &#8220;collective&#8221;: Allison and I. Together we received:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bagel-sized toaster (Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 pizza stone with cutter and lifter (Collins)</li>
<li>1 spaghetti pot (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: chip bag clips (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: matching bathroom towels (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Sim Theme Park (Randy)</li>
<li>1 pastry blender (non-electric) (Collins)</li>
<li>3 tins: Misty Mountain Chocolate Paté (Collins)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to list Allison&#8217;s gifts &#8230; it&#8217;s already too much stuff. But like I said before: &#8220;Give until it hurts.&#8221; After this Christmas, Allison and I are going to make a donation to charity to compensate for the abundance of gifts. We are certainly thankful, and want to share thanks with others less fortunate than ourselves.<br />
Now, back to that Penguin Shaker. It seems that Santa made a visit last night that I wasn&#8217;t aware of (my Santa was very good at hiding things so I couldn&#8217;t see them packed into the car). I apparently made her, er, his &#8220;nice boy list&#8221;, and was therefore the lucky recipient of a Penguin Shaker.<br />
What&#8217;s a Penguin Shaker? Glad you asked. (Incidentally, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, this gets my CGOTY award (Cool Gift Of The Year). Back in the 30&#8217;s after prohibition was lifted, there was a big trend to martinis. The entire movement spawned a style that included penguins (tuxedos; ice). Thus was born the penguin-shaped martini shaker. The basic shape is of a martini shaker, with two wings, and a beak. The beak has a plug at the end that (when unscrewed) acts as a spout; a built-in filter prevents the ice from coming out. It&#8217;s silver-plated and utterly gorgeous.<br />
Following the unwrapping, we proceeded to breakfast, courtesy of Master Chef Randy. Then it was helping Mrs. Collins prepare the evening&#8217;s feast of roast beast. (Okay, turkey, but the Dr. Seuss in me was yelling to get out.) I spent a large portion of the afternoon chopping.<br />
When the rest of the family arrived this evening, we exchanged a few more gifts, and then proceeded to dinner. Not much different than a Sowrey Christmas dinner, except that it&#8217;s a lot quieter here. (Those of us who remember the Sowrey/Sinnott dinners will remember the struggle to gain control of the table&#8217;s conversation.)<br />
After dinner, we all broke up into various conversations. Allison adjourned downstairs for a while to use Randy&#8217;s PlayStation, where Allison totally wiped the walls with me. Allison is the video game equivalent of a pool shark &#8212; she starts off making you feel good, and then cleans your clock. I lost a few layers of skin (not to mention several notches on Ye Olde Ego Meter) when she trounced me 12-0 on Triple Play 98.<br />
I hate sports games.<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a poor loser. I get frustrated easily. I like being able to do *something* other than *nothing*. That&#8217;s when I get labelled &#8220;sore loser&#8221;. Things I need to work on for my New Year&#8217;s Resolution, I guess.<br />
Anyway, that&#8217;s a Collins Christmas for you. &#8216;Tis time for me to consider getting ready for tomorrow &#8230; who know&#8217;s what it will bring?<br />
Merry Ho-Ho!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Twas the night before Christmas,<br />
And all through the house,<br />
Not a creature was stirring,<br />
&#8216;Cause they were all at the hospital.<br />
Well, briefly anyway.<br />
Our evening was off to a startled start, after Allison required immediate medical attention. This goes back to last Tuesday, when Allison had to have minor emergency surgery to eliminate some major pain. The incision she received was not sutured closed (as per the type of surgery).<br />
This evening, it gave her a bit of trouble. Allison had been instructed to visit Emergency in the event her wound acted up. As it stands, it was a normal (in the sense that most people who get that kind of surgery often have some kind of trouble) and we went home.<br />
Then it was off to Allison&#8217;s grandparents for the traditional Christmas Eve visit. This, of course, is a new thing for me. I&#8217;ve never been through a Collins (or Vailmont) Christmas before &#8212; I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect.<br />
Singing. I should have seen it coming.<br />
Carols, to many of which I have since forgotten the words; some I&#8217;d never even heard before. Mrs. Collins and Grandma Vailmont were belting out the majority of the lyrics, although we had a small argument about the words to &#8220;Frosty the Snowman&#8221;.<br />
Tomorrow is my first Christmas away from my family. So yes, it does hurt a little. My parents and my sister aren&#8217;t by my side (or me by theirs). And due to Allison&#8217;s aforementioned surgery, we won&#8217;t see them this holiday season at all.<br />
Originally, we had planned to visit Florida on vacation, and would spend some time with them. However, Allison&#8217;s doctor has effectively forbade her from travelling for six weeks (now five). So we had to cancel our flight. Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad that for the first time, I bought flight insurance.<br />
At least we could travel to the Island, even if we had to sit in the ferry lineup for (are you ready for this?) four hours. And we were there early.<br />
Which reminds me of a detail I keep forgetting. Many of you have wondered when we&#8217;re getting married. You know that we got engaged, but the date kept changing. It&#8217;s official: 26 August 2000. The wheels are in motion. So why does taking the ferry remind me of the wedding? Those of you who will be driving will want reservations so you don&#8217;t have to experience sitting in a lineup for hours on end. It&#8217;s particularly bad in the summer.<br />
Anyway, Christmas is fast approaching. But I&#8217;m doing just fine. Sure, I miss my family, but I&#8217;ve got an extended one here that cares for me. It&#8217;s great to feel wanted, particularly after years of making myself feel otherwise.<br />
So for those of you who get this on Christmas Day, I wish you a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays, depending on which you prefer). For the rest of you, I hope you had a great time.<br />
Expect more within 24 hours&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than seeing the look of complete terror upon someone&#8217;s face. Especially if you know there&#8217;s a benevolent force behind it. Such as with a surprise party&#8230;<br />
Allison&#8217;s birthday was on Sunday past. And I wanted to make it something special.<br />
So at the beginning of November, I started contacting her friends, seeing who I could get to come out and scare the bejeezus out of my fiancée. I knew that I had to start early, because it takes a while to plan out all the little details. And it doesn&#8217;t matter how straight-forward something seems &#8212; there are *always* little details.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d organised a surprise party was when my close friends Stuart and Therese announced they were moving to Calgary. I wanted to give them a farewell present, by showing them how much their friends would miss them. The party was as much for me as it was for them&#8230;<br />
Planning it had been a nightmare &#8230; the logistics were murder. While Therese and Stuart were wandering about Europe, I had been pulling together their friends (with the help of Therese&#8217;s friend Rachel and Stuart&#8217;s friend Jay) and planning out all the details. How?<br />
Rule #1 when planning a surprise party: Get the parents involved.<br />
Why? Simple: If you don&#8217;t tell the parents, they&#8217;ll inevitably screw up your plans. Not intentionally, mind you, but they&#8217;ll do something that will make your well-laid plans worth sqwat. (Yes, &#8220;sqwat&#8221;.) So, if you get the parents involved with the process, you don&#8217;t have to worry about things backfiring on you.<br />
That&#8217;s how I succeeded with Stuart and Therese&#8217;s party &#8230; and that&#8217;s how I succeeded with Allison&#8217;s party. The best part is, most parents are clever &#8212; they&#8217;ll suggest good ideas without you have to tell them what to do. In the case of Allison&#8217;s parents, they invited Allison over to Nanaimo for her birthday. This left our apartment open.<br />
So brought about the second problem: How to get people into our apartment to surprise Allison. This took a lot longer than I thought it would, and the ultimate solution was so simplistic I had to kick myself for not thinking of it earlier. Keys. Cut a spare set of keys, and leave them with a friend.<br />
Then it was setting up a decorator, and making sure that our Key Master would arrive before everyone else. Where we would go for dinner &#8230; even a theme for the evening.<br />
But above all else, the hardest thing to do was keep Allison in the dark. She&#8217;s a smart cookie, and it&#8217;s really hard to keep things from her. Especially when it comes to her birthday. Luckily for me, Allison&#8217;s parents were running a good cover for me.<br />
We left on Friday the 3rd, catching the late ferry to Nanaimo. This gave me enough time to clean up the bedrooms. We did this under the guise of not having enough time to clean before Allison&#8217;s aunt appeared on Monday for a visit. (I hadn&#8217;t asked her aunt to come the day after Allison&#8217;s birthday as an added distraction &#8230; it just kinda worked that way.)<br />
But we didn&#8217;t get everything. Allison&#8217;s insistence that we leave negated any argument I could have to clean the kitchen table. I didn&#8217;t want to have papers all over it when her friends showed up.<br />
The wonders of today&#8217;s modern technology no longer amaze me &#8230; I use them with gusto. I made several calls over my cell phone to Michelle (our Key Master) and begged her to clean off the kitchen table before people started to show up.<br />
(There&#8217;s always one thing that doesn&#8217;t go quite right.)<br />
Allison&#8217;s family birthday party was the next day, the 4th. This amounted to a wonderful dinner of salmon, which Allison had asked for. Also on the menu was chocolate cake. This was no ordinary chocolate cake, mind you &#8212; this was the King/Queen of Chocolate Cakes. It was called something like Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Whipped Chocolate Filling, or something like that.<br />
It was evil.<br />
In a chocolatey good way, that is. I have never, ever has such a devilishly good chocolate cake in my life. (I&#8217;m actually beginning to salivate, just thinking about it.) I can&#8217;t even begin to describe what was in this thing &#8230; all I know is that it was really, REALLY good.<br />
The next day, we were to leave on the 1:00pm ferry. We would arrive in Horseshoe Bay around 3:00pm, and back at our apartment around 3:30. We would talk, chat, whatever for about two hours, and then go to dinner.<br />
That was the plan. But plans have a way of not working exactly as planned.<br />
The ferry was at 12:30, not 1:00pm.<br />
I started to panic a little.<br />
It was a fast ferry. We would arrive nearly an hour before we were supposed to.<br />
I started to panic a lot.<br />
Miracles of modern technology. I called Michelle, and let her know that things were not as well-planned as I had hoped. We tried to figure out what I could do to stall. I had suggested taking Allison to lunch, but she wanted to eat something on the ferry &#8230; that ruled out lunch at the other end. I couldn&#8217;t take the long way home, as it would make her suspicious. Feigning car trouble wasn&#8217;t even a thought &#8212; BCAA would put an end to that right quick.<br />
Then Allison proposed the solution herself &#8212; she wanted to go to IKEA. That would blow an hour and a half, easily.<br />
So it was with much relief that we bypassed our apartment completely and went directly to IKEA. It was a failed mission, in that respect &#8212; the chair covers we had gone looking for were not to be found. IKEA didn&#8217;t carry them in the style we thought they would. We headed home, Allison a little apprehensive about what I had planned for her.<br />
When we arrived (at nearly 4:30, about an hour late because of nightmarish traffic going back), I made sure to grab all the bags, thus tying up my hands so I couldn&#8217;t open the door. No, it&#8217;s hardly chivalrous. but I had to make sure that Allison was the first into the apartment. As we passed the security camera, I looked, waved, and smiled. Because I knew that the 12 people sitting in our living room were watching Channel 59 &#8212; the security camera channel. They knew we were there.<br />
The elevator was a bit slow, by my heart was racing. It was part anticipation, and part realising that maybe this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea. But it was too late, so I concentrated on the anticipation. The hard part was not showing it.<br />
The elevator took forever to finally deposit us on the 6th floor. I exited first, but let Allison lead the way. As we got to the door, I saw that our weekend paper was still wedged in the mail slot &#8212; our awaiting guests had not removed it. I was excited beyond repair. Allison had no clue what was about to happen.<br />
She got in, remarked that the bathroom door was closed (our friends had tossed their shoes in there). The lights were off and it was dark inside, which was good because if we could see, Allison would have seen some of the snacks left on the counter in our kitchen. But she didn&#8217;t see it. (Mind you, Allison saw the extra jackets in the closet, and *still* didn&#8217;t clue in.)<br />
Then it came. A giggle. From someone in the living room.<br />
Allison gasped. Someone was in the apartment. Someone had broken in, and they were still there! As the onset of sheer terror was about to take effect, a very loud and resounding cry was heard (probably through the entire building): &#8220;SURPRISE!&#8221;<br />
Several camera flashes went off. I&#8217;m told the pictures are priceless.<br />
I nearly fell over laughing. Yes, I&#8217;m cruel. I admit it. It was mostly from pure relief that things worked out, after all. (Although for another 20 minutes or so, I was still a bit edgy, wondering if Allison was all right with everything.)<br />
The group went out to dinner at a restaurant not far from our apartment. Wasn&#8217;t the best overall venue, I&#8217;ll admit, but it was the best choice given the size of our party. The place would probably be more interesting later in the evening.<br />
After dinner, most people went their separate ways. (It was a Sunday night, after all, and many people had to go to work the next day.) But Michelle (our Key Bearer), Mike (her husband), and Tyler stuck around. It seemed that there were other things in the evening that I had not planned.<br />
The evening became organic, developing its own events as we went along. We started off at Commodore Lanes, with some five pin bowling. I&#8217;ve discovered how to beat Allison in five pin: Get drunk. Both of us. Her bowling average goes way down, and mine goes way up. (Otherwise, Allison is virtually unbeatable in five pin.) The five of us had a grand old time being really lousy at many things. Especially table hockey. I&#8217;ve always been a lousy player. And foosball. I got creamed at that.<br />
After our bowling excursion, we ended up at Death By Chocolate on Burrard. One of us mentioned that it was Allison&#8217;s birthday. When her dessert showed up, it had a candle on it. Our server just stood there, waiting. Finally, she said: &#8220;C&#8217;mon folks, work with me here.&#8221; We sang Happy Birthday, and indulged in really bad things for us to eat&#8230;<br />
The day so ended as we headed home. Overall, it was a good day, all stress aside. Now I just have to figure out how to outdo myself next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this was certainly a learning experience. Last week, I sent out a survey (sent to me by a friend) that lets people know how much they know about you. It&#8217;s quite informative. After receiving a couple of responses, I thought I&#8217;d compile them. Some are pretty funny, depending on how you know me. Some are very accurate. These are *completely* anonymous (and in random order), so don&#8217;t be worried that I might single you out.<br />
I started off with the following lyric:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run my name through your computer,<br />
Mention me in passing to your college tutor,<br />
Check my records, check my facts,<br />
Check if I&#8217;ve paid my income tax,<br />
Roll over ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; in my CV,<br />
But you&#8217;ll still know nothing &#8217;bout me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of you guessed it right &#8212; the author in question is Sting. Specifically, the lyric is from &#8220;Nothing &#8216;Bout Me&#8221;, the last track on &#8220;Ten Summoner&#8217;s Tales&#8221; (released 1993).<br />
And so, on with the results! Any comments I supply will appear in &#8216;[]&#8217; brackets.<br />
&#8212;<br />
1. My name:<br />
The real answer is, duh, &#8220;Geoff Sowrey&#8221;. Most of the results were correct. There were a few oddities, such as &#8220;Geoff Sowery&#8221; [note the slight misspelling of the last name] and &#8220;Goff Sowrey&#8221; [note the *intentional* misspelling of my first name]. But otherwise it&#8217;s good.<br />
2. Where did we meet?:<br />
There is obviously no right answer for this one. I met a lot of you in lots of strange and interesting places, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>High school</li>
<li>University of Waterloo, Village Two Residence, South A floor, TV   lounge</li>
<li>High school. Chris&#8217; and my birthday parties</li>
<li>Gah&#8230; University of Waterloo, South A.</li>
<li>235 Gordon Street, Guelph, most likely at a party, oui?</li>
<li>University of Waterloo (more specific?  Umm, camping?)</li>
<li>Arkillago [aka Arkipelago]</li>
<li>113 George Street, Toronto, Ontario [aka Arkipelago]</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Take a stab at my middle name..:<br />
This was a good one. I didn&#8217;t realise how few people knew my middle name. It&#8217;s fairly uncommon (or at least it was until shows such as &#8220;Due South&#8221; and &#8220;ER&#8221; made it a little more mainstream): &#8220;Benton&#8221;. A couple surveys had correct answers. The rest believed it was one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert</li>
<li>propellerhead [??]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [more like a nickname from university]</li>
<li>Patrick</li>
<li>Archibald [this submitter did quickly follow up with the correct name]</li>
<li>Edward</li>
</ul>
<p>4. How long have you known me?:<br />
I&#8217;ve known some of you a very long time (some of you receiving this who didn&#8217;t do the survey have known me since the moment I was born &#8212; Hi Mom! &#8212; some of you not quite as long, but almost). The survey respondants gave me a range of between two and 13 years. One answer was fairly specific: &#8220;8yrs 2mths 7 days&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m beginning to feel a little older now&#8230;<br />
5. How well do you know me?:<br />
Okay, this is totally subjective. How do you determine how well you know someone? You may know someone quite well, and then they move away or go to school. Suddenly, you don&#8217;t think you know them as well as you did. Things change&#8230;<br />
The respondants were all over the board on this. Some claimed they didn&#8217;t know me well at all (which is to be expected) to knowing me quite well. Oddly enough, no-one claimed to know me well enough to say I was &#8220;predictable&#8221;. I guess that means I&#8217;m doing something right for a change&#8230;<br />
6. Do I smoke?:<br />
Everyone had the right answer on this. However, I will quote one of them, because I thought it was appropriate: &#8220;dear god no&#8221;. One of the respondants did have a good point, though: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so, then again, you didn&#8217;t drink either.&#8221;<br />
7. Do I believe in God?:<br />
Okay, here&#8217;s a touchy subject if I ever heard it. But I&#8217;m not keen on starting any fires that might take time to extinguish, so I&#8217;m just going to say: If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t worry. I don&#8217;t get offended easily. But I do have to quote a reply, it&#8217;s just too good: &#8220;someone has to be held reponsible for creating you&#8221;.<br />
8. What was your first impression when you first saw me?:<br />
This was a good one. This is where the true me starts to show through. Okay, you can all stop laughing now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>That guy is a looney</li>
<li>What&#8217;s with the sandals?</li>
<li>Son of Worf [just remember me with a beard and long hair]</li>
<li>shy, eager to be friendly</li>
<li>Loves computers.</li>
<li>loud [no comments from the peanut gallery, please]</li>
<li>what a spaz!</li>
<li>very intelligent person, with a few quirks [a *few*?]</li>
<li>looks friendly, not like that scary Justin guy or that shifty little   Jim, and he doesn&#8217;t smell as bad as that Rob guy.</li>
</ul>
<p>9. My age?:<br />
My age (current) is 27 years, 4 months, and 9 days. However, I&#8217;ll take 27 as the answer. A couple put down 26 [thanks for making me feel a little younger], two put down 28 [close, but no banana], and one thought I was &#8220;late gen X&#8221; [AIIEEEEEE! I could be as old as 38!].<br />
10. Birthday?:<br />
The correct answer is 16 July 1972 (I will accept July 16 1972, of course). Some responses claimed it was &#8220;July&#8221; [close enough], &#8220;sometime in the summer&#8221; [sorry, but Alex Trebek would ask you to be more specific], and &#8220;you have one each year&#8221; [doesn&#8217;t everyone?].<br />
11. Color hair?:<br />
Officially, brown. Every response was correct. Luckily for you folks, I haven&#8217;t taken to dying my hair.<br />
Yet.<br />
12. Color eyes?:<br />
Allison tells me they&#8217;re green. I always thought they were kinda bluish. I just stared in the mirror. They&#8217;re kinda greeny. Heck, *I* don&#8217;t know what colour my eyes are. So I really don&#8217;t mind that the replies varied from brown to hazel to blue to green. (Yes, there is at least one person who agrees with Allison.)<br />
13. Tall / average / short / fat / average / thin?:<br />
Most of the answers were &#8220;average / average&#8221;. I guess that was to be expected&#8230;<br />
14. Do I have any siblings?:<br />
One. A sister, Cathy. Most were right (although only a couple knew her name), a few got this wrong.<br />
15. (If opposite sex) Have you ever had a crush on me?: (If same sex) Have you ever been jealous of me?:<br />
This was one of the few questions I was hoping for good answers. My ego running wild, I guess. Either way, all but three respondants completely shot me down (thanks, guys). Apparently, I&#8217;ve never been the sort to attract others &#8230; the nearest I got to others having a crush on me was &#8220;officially, no&#8221; and &#8220;A crush no, but I would say we use to have a close bond&#8221;. Only one of the same sex was ever jealous of me. Oh, and there was that one joker who *had* to write: &#8220;(Ha, ha, ha, ha!)&#8221; [insert sound of ego deflating].<br />
16. Whats one of my favorite thing to do?:<br />
Again, some pretty strange responses here. People have some pretty interesting ideas of what my favourite things are. (Everyone knows it&#8217;s bright paper packages tied up with string&#8230;) Answers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer stuff</li>
<li>bike really long distances once in a while</li>
<li>make trouble with Stuart with Chris</li>
<li>Play on computer, write, eat ice cream.</li>
<li>play Doom</li>
<li>eat and imbide Guiness</li>
<li>play video games (it used to be Quake&#8230;?)</li>
<li>Watching/talking/re-enacting Star Wars. [I&#8217;m not that bad! Really!]</li>
<li>Used to be watch sci fi, hang out with friends, go to Jack Astors,   ride your bike, and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Sigh* The things I used to to &#8230; wait a minute, I still do most of those. At least whenever possible.<br />
17. Do you remember one of the first things I said to you?:<br />
This varied for a few people. The most obvious answer was &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;Hello&#8221;. (I have a tendency of saying that when I meet people for the first time.) However, a few of you received quite different first words:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;What channel is Animaniacs on?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I wrote this program to enhance this computer game&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>Actually, it was a huge rant about running into Chris on your bike,   and getting invited to said birthday party [I was ranting? Me? Rant?]</li>
<li>no but I remember a math textbook falling on my head [This is from my   high school locker victim, er, partner]</li>
</ul>
<p>18. What&#8217;s my favorite type of music?:<br />
Wow. This one was fun. I knew I was going to get some pretty bizarre answers. For record, everyone was correct on this. It all depends what musical phase you caught me in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beatles</li>
<li>Sting, Sarah [Mclachlan], .. whattya call that?</li>
<li>80&#8217;s pop music [okay, what child of the 80&#8217;s *didn&#8217;t*like that   music?]</li>
<li>Rock</li>
<li>ANY bloody type [Technically, the correct answer]</li>
<li>Sting obviously (that should get me the bonus question eh?)</li>
<li>skit songs from Monty Python</li>
<li>new rock (alternative)</li>
<li>you like everything [again, the technically correct answer]</li>
</ul>
<p>19. What is my best feature?:<br />
If it were possible to blush through email, I would. Many of the answers were quite generous. I should have added a question: &#8220;What is my worst feature?&#8221; I think that would be just as telling.</p>
<ul>
<li>very sweet and generous person</li>
<li>friendly nature and honesty</li>
<li>sense of humour</li>
<li>loyalty, selflessness</li>
<li>Down to earth (wow, that was a surprise!)</li>
<li>Allison.  (Ha, ha, ha.) [This is the same joker who laughed earlier]</li>
<li>friendliness earnestness oops thats two</li>
<li>Smile</li>
</ul>
<p>20. Am I shy or outgoing?<br />
Over the past few years, many people have attempted to tell me what I am. There are those who told me that my hyperness was a cover for my shyness. There are those who told me that I come on too strong. It seems that most people can&#8217;t really decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing especially when chocolate is consumed</li>
<li>both</li>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>shy, becoming more outgoing</li>
<li>Outgoing most of the time</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re outgoing, but you&#8217;re really shy</li>
<li>outgone [I take that means I&#8217;m past going?]</li>
<li>outgoing externally, but internally shy</li>
<li>Definitely outgoing</li>
</ul>
<p>21. Would you say I am funny?:<br />
Generally, this was &#8220;yes&#8221;. The range basically went from &#8220;very&#8221; to &#8220;maybe just a little&#8221; [although I detected an ode of sarcasm on that one].<br />
22. Am I a rebel or do I follow all the rules?<br />
This one was nearly as polarised as #20 &#8212; I obviously put across some very different vibes to people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules, unless you are hanging around Chris.</li>
<li>rebel but in an off the wall way</li>
<li>Well, you don&#8217;t follow ALL the rules, so &#8220;rebel&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>a little of both</li>
<li>Middle of the road</li>
<li>rebel</li>
<li>follow the rules (in general)</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re a rebel, but you follow the rules, pretty much to a   &#8216;t&#8217; [Ouch! That&#8217;s gonna leave a mark&#8230;]</li>
</ul>
<p>23. Any special talents?:<br />
How do you define a &#8220;special talent&#8221;? I never thought of myself having a talent &#8212; I can&#8217;t act, I can&#8217;t draw (at least without the aid of a computer), I can&#8217;t sing (most of you know that). Okay, I can write (most of you know that) &#8230; but write well? That&#8217;s another issue. The respondants thought I had a few interesting abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;out of box analytical thinking&#8221; is not your average skill&#8230;</li>
<li>excellent writer, great imagination</li>
<li>story telling &#8211; in great detail</li>
<li>many. being a great friend amongst them. Computer knowledge too.</li>
<li>Prolific writing, belching</li>
<li>geez, i dunno &#8211; other than programming?</li>
<li>Playing baseball in flip-flops [when did I do this??]</li>
<li>too many to list. certainly not a couch potato</li>
<li>Never-ending energy</li>
</ul>
<p>24. Would you consider me a friend?:<br />
As a rule, I don&#8217;t make enemies. I don&#8217;t like them. So I generally make (and try my best to keep) friends. It&#8217;s not easy &#8230; particularly when most of them live outside the province. Most replies seem to agree with me on that. A few expressed concerns that perhaps the friendship is waning a little due to the march of time, but I think friendship continues beyond that. If you&#8217;re receiving this email, it&#8217;s because of one of two reasons:<br />
a) You&#8217;re family (or about to be family). b) You&#8217;re a friend.<br />
25. Would you call me preppy, slutty, a homie ,average, sporty, punk, hippie, glam, nerdy, snobby, or something else?:<br />
Wow. Some really crazy answers here. I&#8217;ll let them speak for themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are something else alright. You never remained the same for long   periods of time.</li>
<li>wackey, understanding, talented and more.</li>
<li>smartypants</li>
<li>Hmm, I&#8217;ll choose &#8220;hippie.&#8221;</li>
<li>average [two people thought this]</li>
<li>Edgy (when playing Doom with Scott lurking about the house). [The   Scott in question is from University.]</li>
<li>hippie with a touch of nerdy</li>
<li>dog gone nutty</li>
</ul>
<p>26. Have you ever seen me cry?:<br />
Not many people have seen me cry. Those of you who have probably know me better than anyone else.<br />
27. If there were one good nickname for me, what would it be?<br />
Ah yes, the ubiquitous nickname. I&#8217;ve had a lot of these in the course of my life. I wish I&#8217;d recorded them all &#8212; it would be interesting to see how my nicknames evolved as I got older. At the moment, my nicknames appear to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grapes [my old boss gave me this &#8230; still don&#8217;t know why]</li>
<li>Goff</li>
<li>Ge-off [pronounced &#8220;gee-off&#8221;]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [although I haven&#8217;t really gone by this in a while]</li>
<li>Pepe Gonzales [??]</li>
<li>Han Solo [I feel like a scruffy nerfherder&#8230;]</li>
<li>Propellerhead</li>
<li>Celery [wow &#8212; that&#8217;s one I haven&#8217;t heard since I was a kid!]</li>
<li>Macgyver [Yes, like the TV show &#8212; I got that from my dad, although he   wasn&#8217;t in the survey]</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes I wish we celebrated American holidays. At least then we&#8217;d   have one more Hallmark Holiday(tm) between Hallowe&#8217;en and Christmas. As   it stands, we now have a two-month Christmas season. Don&#8217;t fool yourselves,   folks &#8212; Christmas won&#8217;t end until almost New Year&#8217;s. Although at least   this year, the Ol&#8217; Ball Drop will have a little more significance than   usual &#8230; assuming the lights don&#8217;t go out.<br />
At any rate, Christmas arrived in the malls November 1. Yick. Allison   and I can&#8217;t go for walks without seeing Christmas lights everywhere. It&#8217;s   actually sickening. We were flabbergasted that lights were appearing shortly   after Hallowe&#8217;en (at least give us a couple weeks, eh?) &#8212; then we saw   the Christmas tree in the neighbouring apartment building.<br />
Then, of course, there are the commercials. Endless festive, Prozac-infused   spots urging us to run up those credit card bills to buy gifts for those   millions of people on our gift-giving lists. I haven&#8217;t even got to the   Christmas cards yet!<br />
So why all the bitterness? I had to do my Christmas shopping this weekend.   It&#8217;s a new record for me &#8212; I have *never* shopped this early. It&#8217;s not   really relaxing &#8230; there&#8217;s still all the stress of wading through all   the junk to find that special something for those special people I won&#8217;t   see this year.<br />
You see, I&#8217;m not going to Ontario for Christmas this year. I&#8217;m staying   here. Last year, Allison spent a Sowrey Christmas. This year, it&#8217;s my turn   to experience a Collins Christmas. I&#8217;m looking forward to it &#8230; if I can   get through all the sales first.<br />
It started on Saturday. Allison and I darted out to Pacific Centre Mall   to see what things were available for our hard-earned dollars. It&#8217;s not   a great mall, especially since Eaton&#8217;s closed. (I have to say, it&#8217;s a   sad, disturbing feeling to look through the glass doors at the now-empty,   once-proud anchor of Canadian commerce.)<br />
The Saturday run was mostly to see what was available, although we did   find an excellent selection for one part of my family (sorry folks, no   hints). We spotted two other good possibilities, but the mall closed before   we could act on those impulses.<br />
It was then off to our evening entertainment. We had to activities to   choose from: See Kevin Smith&#8217;s new celluloid tour-de-force, Dogma, or   see a local band. The band went on at 10:00pm, which coincidentally was   the same time the movie started. We opted for trying to get in to see   the band, and then seeing the movie if all else failed.<br />
We arrived to find very few scalpers (one of whom was disguised as someone   looking for tickets, as not to give away his shadier motives). Initial   prices were $40. We went for dinner. When we returned, the ticket prices   had jumped to $50. We went into a nearby bookstore. When we came back,   the prices had returned to $40. We were aiming for $30.<br />
It&#8217;s a tricky game, dealing with scalpers. Most of them aren&#8217;t terribly   bright, nor are they patient. Having been through the University of Waterloo,   patience is something I have in abundance. Despite the chilly weather   (and me without my jacket) and the rain, neither Allison or I were willing   to budge on the price.<br />
The tickets were originally $22.50. A scalping company, known as Ticketmaster,   added an additional $5 to the price. We were being nice by offering a   profit of $2.50 per ticket. And when the rain started to fall heavily,   the scalpers agreed. $30 apiece. No movie for us&#8230;<br />
We had tickets to enter a Vancouver legend &#8212; the Fabulous Commodore   Ballroom. This was, until a few years ago, the best place to see any live   music performance. Then it closed down, and Vancouver was cursed with   having no venue for good bands. Then the House of Blues came in with a   bucket of money. Earlier this year, the doors swung open again.<br />
Wow.<br />
It&#8217;s a venue like no other. Art deco stylings &#8212; very 1930&#8217;s. The room   is huge &#8212; easily the size of an Olympic-size hockey rink &#8230; squared.   And then there&#8217;s the floor&#8230;<br />
Rumour had it that the original floor had something like 12 feet of horse   hair under it for springiness. Apparently, it was wood rot (they found   this during renovation). The new floor is in much better shape &#8230; but   just as springy. I&#8217;m not kidding, either &#8212; you can literally be knocked   from your feet in a mosh pit if you bounce out of beat with the rest of   the crowd. The vibration can be felt in the entire room. If an earthquake   were to hit, you&#8217;d probably never know.<br />
Allison and I stole up to the front of the dance floor, taking positions   roughly in the middle of the barricade between the crowd and the stage.   Front row seating, or rather, standing.<br />
The first band was from Toronto, the name of which I now forget. They   were good. Obviously, not good enough for me to remember their name, but   still good.<br />
By the time the featured act took the stage, Allison and I were trapped   against the barricade, desperately trying to hold our position against   all the people trying to force us out. But we held &#8230; it was the best   place to get a close look at Spirit of the West.<br />
We stayed up at the front for four songs &#8230; until some crowd-surfing   moron landed on Allison&#8217;s head. We took a hasty exit before one of us got   seriously injured. (John Mann, lead singer for SotW, later threatened   to refund crowd-surfer&#8217;s tickets and eject them from the premises for   making his &#8220;guests&#8221; leave the front &#8212; he was referring to us and a few   others.)<br />
Four words: &#8220;Home For A Rest&#8221;.<br />
This is perhaps one of SotW&#8217;s most popular songs (after &#8220;Save This House&#8221;).   You could barely hear John over the audience. *Everyone* was singing.   (The only concert experience that beat this was listening to 40,000 of   my closest friends singing along to The Tragically Hip.)<br />
About a dozen songs, a spirited rendition of &#8220;I Got You, Babe&#8221; and two   encores later, Allison and I ducked out before the tide crushed us.<br />
I resumed shopping the next day, considerably less bitter than the day   before. This was a chance for me to rush around and get the bulk of my   family shopping complete. I have to ship the stuff sometime this week,   if I&#8217;m not mistaken. Aside from a hefty batch of Cheezies (don&#8217;t worry   Mom, I haven&#8217;t forgotten this time), I&#8217;m done.<br />
So I&#8217;m a little less testy about the whole Christmas thing now. Maybe   it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve got part of my shopping done. Either that, or I just   haven&#8217;t noticed the 5,000,000 lights erected since last night&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate moving.<br />
I mean, I <em>really</em> hate moving.<br />
As you know, we moved to a new apartment yesterday. Based on the amount of time that it took to move Brian and Gill from their apartment to their house, I assumed (rather stupidly, it seems) that the trip would take about five hours.<br />
We started about 8pm the night before. Allison&#8217;s parents (who graciously wasted two days of their vacation helping us move) arrived and began to help us finish packing. We&#8217;d been packing for nearly two weeks, but due to all the other things we had to deal with we simply didn&#8217;t get everything done.<br />
The next morning, the packing resumed on the remaining small things. At about 11:45am, I headed out to get the truck. We rented a 17-foot cube van, which I thought would be ample to the task of moving our stuff. That was mistake #1.<br />
Traffic was a nightmare. My dear, close friend Murphy was following me everywhere. The rainy season had started in the Lower Mainland, of course on the day we had to move. The lights were out at Nanaimo and Kingsway, backing traffic up for blocks in both directions. I just knew it was going to be a rough day. If only I had known how rough.<br />
Returning to the apartment with the truck, we proceeded to load our lives&#8217; possessions into the truck. I was extremely grateful for the Collins&#8217; help &#8212; we never would have been able to move on our own. Because we were moving on a weekday, we were also unable to get friends to help &#8212; they were all at work.<br />
The idea had been to load the truck by 2:00, get down to the new apartment by 2:30, and have the truck back by 5:30.<br />
That was the idea.<br />
In reality, we had the *first* load ready by 3:00, we were unloaded by 4:15, and back to the old apartment to pick up the *second* load. Fortunately, we&#8217;d lucked out by having Michelle and Tyler (two friends of ours) leave work early to help us move. We stole Tyler going back to the old apartment.<br />
The second load was ready somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 8:00pm, give or take a half-hour. (By that point, it really didn&#8217;t matter any more.) We were unloaded by somewhere around 9:45. After that, I took the truck back, picked up my car, and drove to my new home.<br />
10 hours. It took 10 hours to get it all done. Note to self: Remember this the next time we get the silly idea that we can live someplace better.<br />
As it stands, the apartment is a disaster. There&#8217;s stuff everywhere. It&#8217;s gonna take us about a week to sort it all out.<br />
Like I said, I hate moving.<br />
Next time, we&#8217;re getting professional movers.<br />
And of course, there&#8217;s the aftermath. Rogers botched our @Home installation (we&#8217;re about 1 second away from getting ASDL to compensate for their incompetence). We still have to clean out our old apartment and turn in the keys.<br />
Overall, this isn&#8217;t an experience I want to relive for quite some time. So for the foreseeable future, here&#8217;s where you can reach us:<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The alarm went off at 8:00, and I staggered out of bed. Chris and I had made tentative plans to go for breakfast, but I needed to call him and find out. Chris couldn&#8217;t make it. The whole week had been like that &#8212; we&#8217;d been trying to get together, but one thing after another prevented our reunion.<br />
I returned to bed.<br />
I ran a few errands that morning, leaving Allison in Oakville. The errands took longer than I originally planned, putting me back on time. But I made sure to stop into Canadian Computer on Speers. I wanted to see Chris, even if for only five minutes.<br />
Two years ago, Chris was a computer novice. He hated the things. (Especially the 286 he used for most of his work.) Now he frightens me. I&#8217;m amazed at all the things he&#8217;s learned in the PAST YEAR. Now he&#8217;s an expert. And that meant he was busy.<br />
I got to talk with Chris for all of about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, he was help customers and answering phones. (One of the customers was a teacher from my high school, Suzi Beber, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen since I graduated.)<br />
Then it was over. Realising I had to go home, I bade Chris farewell, and headed home. All the way, I felt fairly numb. I had a huge list of people I&#8217;d wanted to visit with. Most of them didn&#8217;t even get a phone call. (Some people think I have too many friends.) It was too late, though. I couldn&#8217;t do anything more. I saw a few people, chatted with a few more. But it was over too soon. Too fast.<br />
We arrived at the airport about an hour ahead of time. I prefer half an hour for domestic flights, but Allison pointed out that we usually get rushed. I said goodbye to my dad, hugged my sister (my mom didn&#8217;t want to come &#8212; she hates goodbyes &#8212; so I hugged her before we left Oakville), and headed into Terminal 3.<br />
We arrived in Vancouver around 7:30pm PDT following a rather eventless flight. (Not that I&#8217;m looking for an eventful flight.) We grabbed our bags, hopped the Park N&#8217; Fly shuttle, and went to pick up the car.<br />
The car&#8217;s battery was dead. I don&#8217;t know how the heck they got the car there, short of pushing it. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have noted that.<br />
Morons.<br />
As we drove home (after getting the car jumped), I remarked on something I hadn&#8217;t noticed before. I felt like I was home. For the first time since I moved here, I felt like I was at home. It was a strange feeling. For the longest time, I didn&#8217;t think I could ever feel at home here. But I do, to some degree at least.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still miss my family and friends. I always will &#8212; you&#8217;re all a huge part of my life. I can&#8217;t forget you any more than I can sever an arm and not notice.<br />
But I was home. I collapsed in our couch, and felt like I was at home. A strange feeling, indeed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Old Man was still cursing the sink the following morning. By the time Allison and I left for Waterloo, the plumber had arrived to solve the problem once and for all. (It would take an additional two hours, and several holes drilled in the wall to finally eradicate the clog.)<br />
The drive up to Waterloo was very pleasant &#8212; it was a beautiful day. I wanted to show Allison where I went to school. The memories were flooding back even before I turned onto Highway 86. By the time I turned onto Ring Road, I was getting some serious deja vu.<br />
But the campus seemed foreign. The students looked much younger (did I ever look that young?), more naive. The university seemed no different than I remembered, with the exception of modifications to South Campus Hall.<br />
After a quick driving tour of the campus, we started the walking tour. This took us from South Campus Hall, between the science buildings, through Math and Computer (I was disappointed to see the Red Room is no longer visible), through Davis Center, back to the Campus Centre (aka the Student Life Centre), over to Needless Hell (aka Needles Hall), through Hagey Hall, and then back to South Campus Hall.<br />
It felt strange walking around. I felt old. Allison commented that an entire (three-year) class had entered and graduated since I left. It&#8217;s a strange feeling, walking around, not seeing any familiar faces.<br />
We left U(W), and drove around Uptown Waterloo, then Downtown Kitchener. We stopped for a while to take advantage of the Oktoberfest that was underway, picking up a pair of rather flavourless sausages.<br />
It&#8217;s kind of ironic that in the five years I was in Waterloo (four years of which I was actually there for Oktoberfest), I only went ONCE to the festivities. (This was prior to my decision to start drinking alcohol, so needless to say I didn&#8217;t have that much fun.) Okay, that&#8217;s not the ironic part. Here&#8217;s the irony: As we headed back to the car, we were approached by a pair of (American?) tourists who were looking for more &#8220;fun&#8221; attractions. They asked this of a guy, who although spent four years in Waterloo during Oktoberfest, had not lived there for over three years. I directed them to the Hans Haas (aka the Information booth).<br />
We headed up to Highway 7 on our trip out to Guelph. Within minutes, we were leaving Kitchener/Waterloo heading east. I had to admit, I almost didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; there are many memories for me there, and several people I would have liked to visit with. But there wasn&#8217;t time. There&#8217;s never enough time.<br />
We drove around Guelph, during which I attempted to give Allison a rough tour of the area. I don&#8217;t know Guelph as well as my friends who went to Guelph (or spent a lot of time in the city), but I&#8217;d been there enough times that I knew the area.<br />
Our first stop was at McCrae House. Well, after we drove around a bit before we found it (we took a wrong turn and ended up on the wrong side of the Speed River). McCrae House is the birthplace of John McCrae, author of &#8220;In Flanders Fields&#8221;. We appeared 45 minutes late to go in the museum, unfortunately.<br />
The tour continued up the sidestreets around McCrae House, where Allison oohed and aahed at the beauty of the leaf-covered streets and all the red brick houses. If it weren&#8217;t for the distance, the winters, and the dryness, I figure I could get Allison to move there.<br />
Then it was past the &#8216;X&#8217; House (the &#8216;X&#8217;s are still visible in the window, by the way) on Gordon St. before turning into the University of Guelph. The tour here was fair short, as our time was continuing be tight. We had to be in Acton by 6:30, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how long that would take.<br />
Again, memories. Pangs of regret. The invisible tears of missed friends. They say that smell is the strongest sense that can evoke a memory &#8212; I often find that sight works just as well.<br />
Returning to Highway 7, we continued on our way east. We stopped briefly on the edge of Guelph to get something to drink. I hopped into the convenience store, and purchased a ginger ale for Allison, and a Sprite for me. Well, it was going to be a Sprite until I spied my favourite drink &#8230; Wink. You can&#8217;t get Wink in BC (mind you, you can&#8217;t get Cheezies in Ontario). I took the bottles and presented them to the clerk. I was $0.20 short. I was about to pull the Wink back, resigning myself to never having a visit with an old friend. The clerk, however, said I could pay him back later.<br />
Oh. Okay. Sure. No problem.<br />
Sucker.<br />
We arrived in Acton shortly after 6:00, far too early to arrive at our destination. We were going to Jason and Steph&#8217;s place in north Acton (aka the middle of nowhere) to have dinner with our hosts and two more of my friends, Brian and Gill. Allison had met Brian and Gill before, but I couldn&#8217;t remember if she had met Jason or Steph before. My guess was &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />
Because we were early, I thought we&#8217;d check out downtown Acton. After laughing hysterically about the phrase &#8220;It&#8217;s worth the drive to Acton&#8221;, we decided to visit the company that inspired that phrase &#8212; the Olde Hyde House.<br />
Holy leather, Batman!<br />
I&#8217;ve been in a lot of stores, but I&#8217;ve never seen that much leather before. Ever. We wandered about the store, just to see what they had. Most of it was nice, and I debated off and on about picking out Allison&#8217;s birthday present (she&#8217;s always wanted a leather jacket). Nothing really struck me as &#8220;I gotta get her that!&#8221;. (Sorry, honey, no jacket this year.)<br />
We followed the directions Brian gave me and actually managed to find Chateau Fournier. It wasn&#8217;t long before (most of) the gang was assembled. Jason and Steph treated us to a steak dinner (Jason&#8217;s mom sacrificed her fingers for our meal, accidentally slicing off part of her index finger and thumb on a vicious man(woman)-eating slicer).<br />
Then it was a game of croquano (crocano, krokano &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how the heck you spell it), a game that you could almost call circular curling. If you play it with Brian, it&#8217;s &#8220;kill your opponent&#8221;. Mind you, I&#8217;m not much different&#8230;<br />
It was hard leaving. The memory thing, y&#8217;know. The last time I&#8217;d seen Jason was at his stag; for Steph, it was camping a couple of years ago. I didn&#8217;t know when I would see either Brian or Gill again. It&#8217;s a little sobering when you realise that you have to leave your friends again. You&#8217;d think that after a while, it would stop hurting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The original plan that day was to go into Toronto. Allison was feeling better, and she wanted to see the various neighbourhoods of Toronto she had heard so much about. That was the original plan, and plans around the Sowrey homestead tend to change without warning.<br />
That morning, it was because of simple request: &#8220;Geoff, can you help me move the chest downstairs?&#8221;<br />
The dishwasher had overflowed and leaked into the basement, leaking onto a chest. Why had the dishwasher overflowed? A plug in the line. Take three guesses what we didn&#8217;t do that day.<br />
We tried Drano. To no avail. We tried a plunger. To no avail. We tried more Drano. To no avail. We tried draining the trap, running a short line to clean out whatever the problem was, filling it up with Drano, and then plunging it. To no avail.<br />
My dad returned with a bottle of sulphuric acid. The reaction between the sulphuric acid and the Drano was pungent, chasing everyone from the kitchen. It did nothing. After my father disappeared to go to his job, I went up to the load hardware store and returned with a drain snake. Even shoving 15 feet of this into the drain did nothing.<br />
Allison suffered the entire time. She wanted to go to Toronto. Instead, she was effectively banished to the basement, and surfed the Internet. All day. For about four hours, I did nothing but try and clear this wretched clog. To no avail.<br />
Dinner that evening was at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s, where I (under the supervision of the master chef Allison) made Indian curry. Mmmmm, tasty. We spent several hours there, making dinner, eating dinner, and talking the entire time. It was kind of weird, when I thought about all the things that had changed since I left for BC two years ago. Cathy had not only left home, but now had a home of her own. Her own kitchen, her own living room, her own yard.<br />
Returning home, we found my father had effectively dissected the kitchen drain. A collective 12 litres of Drano and sulphuric acid had done nothing to the clog &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. Of course, that didn&#8217;t mean that my dad wasn&#8217;t finished. Craig&#8217;s snake went in to try and flush out the problem.<br />
I guess you really had to be there. My old man, sitting on a short stool, hanging onto a short metal rod attached to the snake. He reeled it in, he forced it back. It was like watching a dramatisation of &#8220;Old Man and the Sea&#8221;, although I&#8217;d reword it &#8212; &#8220;Old Man and the Sink&#8221;.<br />
No amount of blowing, sucking, forcing, snaking, or flushing could do anything. At 1:30am, more than 12 hours after this fiasco started, I went to bed.</p>

		<p>Allison was not feeling well the following morning. Jet lag, the flu, a bad bit of food, we didn&#8217;t know &#8212; only Allison was not feeling well. Wednesday thus became a slow day &#8212; Allison slept off her illness, I read everything I could find. And there wasn&#8217;t much.<br />
That evening, we had a family dinner (including Cathy and Craig) &#8212; roast beef. This is my dad&#8217;s favourite meal. He looks for excuses to make it. It was a good meal, and we had a good time.<br />
After dinner, I poked my head into the attic in search of a leak that had formed above the pot light over the kitchen sink. Craig was in there moments after me, and was the one willing to dive into the fibreglass insulation to find the problem. It seemed that my dad&#8217;s brand-new roof was leaking. He was not pleased.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The alarm went off at 6:45am. I was up almost immediately, Allison begged for &#8220;five more minutes&#8221;. I took the opportunity to quickly have some orange juice. Allison was in the shower moments later.<br />
We had to be at Yonge and Sheppard by 10:00am, and the trip would take about an hour. Allison wanted to get there in plenty of time, which meant we were catching the 8:03 GO Train from Clarkson.<br />
My dad delivered us to Clarkson station at 8:00. I jogged ahead of Allison and purchased tickets. After riding the GO Train for a year, I had a kind of sixth-sense that told me we had to hurry &#8212; and the time wasn&#8217;t my only tip-off. No sooner than we had our tickets in hand and were walking up the stairs to the platform did the train arrive. Like clockwork.<br />
The train went express at Clarkson, which meant we were downtown in about 20 minutes &#8212; a feat that is virtually impossible in a car at that time of day. (Of course, now that I&#8217;ve said that, one of you will probably try to prove me wrong.) Arriving at Union Station, we followed the other lemmings into the GO Concourse and into the subway.<br />
The furthest north on the Yonge line I had been was York Mills, where I got off during my tenure at Digital Equipment. That was nearly six years ago. (Six years? Oh boy, I can feel them gray hairs just popping out of my head &#8230; and the other hairs falling off.) We were heading to Sheppard, two more stops beyond that. Allison had no idea just how far north we were going.<br />
We were starving by the time we arrived. Luckily, there was a friendly neighbourhood McDonald&#8217;s on the McCorner. We indulged ourselves with a bit of McBreakfast (which is known to bring on period bouts of McNausea). The McPlace was not even half-full of people, but still took a while to get our McMeal. At first, I thought my McServer&#8217;s name was &#8220;Ebola&#8221; &#8212; imagine getting stuck with that name! As it turned out, her name was &#8220;Errola&#8221;. Dunno if that&#8217;s any better&#8230;<br />
About 9:30, we headed to the building where Allison was to have her meeting. During her departure, I was going to make a few phone calls to obtain information and make a general nuisance of myself.<br />
Allison was up there for two hours. It took me only 45 minutes to complete my tasks. (I also ran out of quarters for the payphone.) During that time, I got a tonne of information about setting up a webserver over an ASDL line, made arrangements for lunch and dinner, made an appointment for Allison at Arkipelago (my old Toronto haunt), and dropped a line to a few friends &#8230; none of whom were at their desks.<br />
That left me with a hour and 15 minutes to be bored out of my mind. I watched elevator load after elevator load walk by, none of them being Allison. After a while, I felt like a dog that watches all the cars go down the road, hoping one of them is its master. (No allusion drawing, please.)<br />
Following her seemingly-successful meeting, we headed downtown to meet with my cousin, Lauren. We went to one of her favourite restaurants, a tiny Thai bistro about a block south from Bloor. We had to wait a few minutes, but the wait was worth it &#8212; the food was good, and not too expensive (for a business-style Toronto eatery, that is).<br />
After lunch, we hopped the subway back down to Queen Street to walk to Arkipelago. It was strange walking down streets I hadn&#8217;t been on in two years. Things were at the same time familiar, but not. It was like someone had taken a picture of my old world, changed a few things, and then shown me the picture without telling me what they had changed.<br />
The familiar smell of Arkipelago was weaker than I remembered &#8230; but it had been two years since I last smelled the aroma of the wood and varnish that permeated the air. The space seemed a bit more cramped, especially with the additional people. When I had left Arkipelago, there were about 15 people. Over 30 people occupy its spaces. The people scattered everyone reminded me of what Arkipelago looked like when I started there.<br />
The meeting was with Diedre, one of Arkipelago&#8217;s newer acquisitions. We had hoped to meet with Tim or Todd, but they were both in Europe. Be that as it may, the meeting went very well, or at least so we thought. Following the discussion (which I was mostly a silent witness), I quickly visited with the Arkipelago veterans who were still there.<br />
We walked down to St. Lawrence Market, so I could show Allison Toronto&#8217;s idea of the Granville Island Market. Then it was off to meet Brenda and Marek at the Movenpick in BCE Place. We enjoyed an interesting dinner and a good discussion. Then we had to split ways and go home.</p>

		<p>If Sunday was quiet, Monday was dead. Being Thanksgiving Monday, it also meant that every store in Ontario was closed. (Stupid Holiday Shopping Act.) As it stood, Allison had work to do. Unlike myself, who was trying his best to distance himself from work, Allison had brought work with her. In an attempt to extend her client base, we were going to visit two companies in search of more work.<br />
One of them wanted a proposal that Allison would present during their meeting. Allison also wanted (well, not really, but she had no choice) to work on a series of factsheets for another company. I set her up on my mother&#8217;s computer downstairs, and let her run free.<br />
I spent part of the day calling friends, seeing who was available and who wasn&#8217;t. Some people I couldn&#8217;t get a hold of &#8212; bad phone numbers, no answer, no answering machine (it&#8217;s nearly the third millennium, people &#8212; get with it!).<br />
We met up with Kathryn that evening. It was so good to see her again &#8212; her insanely busy schedule often keeps her correspondence to a minimum &#8230; as did the long distance phone call she had to make to get her email. (I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I sent a snail-mail letter.)<br />
The three of us drove around Oakville in search of a place to have a light bite and a long conversation. After a bit of frustration, we ended up in Jack Astor&#8217;s, ordering bruchetta. The long conversation ensued.<br />
It was good to talk with Kathryn again. She&#8217;s one of my closest friends, even though I&#8217;m lucky if I get to see her once a year. It was pure luck that were in the same vicinity at the same time, so I was more than happy to take advantage of it.<br />
About two or so hours later, we called it an evening, and headed home. We wanted to get to bed a little earlier than usual &#8212; we had a train to catch the following morning.</p>

		<p>The fire was still going the next morning. I don&#8217;t know if they rekindled it, or if the fire had just simply burned all night.<br />
Breakfast was eggs, bacon, leftover ham, and potatoes (not the deep-fried ones, thank Heaven). It was just as tasty as ever. Following our repast, Allison and I hit the road to go home.<br />
We retraced most of our route, including a stop at Weber&#8217;s for a quick hamburger. As we entered Barrie, we spied a familiar-looking RV travelling south. Pulling in behind, we followed my parents until my dad signalled to get off the highway at Highway 89.<br />
Here, we were given directions on how to get to my Aunt&#8217;s. We planned to (briefly) stop by Aunt Ruth&#8217;s place in Caledon East. I hadn&#8217;t been there since April 1996, and was very curious to see how the landscaping renovations had gone. I was also wanted to see my relatives.<br />
My parents weren&#8217;t coming &#8212; they had to return to Oakville. Instead, Allison and I took off across remote Ontario in search of the Lockton Spinney (the name of Aunt Ruth&#8217;s home). They weren&#8217;t there. The home was deserted, only a small fluffy cat (Iggy, so I&#8217;m told) was there to greet us.<br />
I was surprised that I could find my way out of the area with little difficulty. My dad had attempted to give me fairly complicated instructions that involved a lot of turns. I opted for three: turning onto Gore Road, turning onto Old Church Road, and turning onto Airport Road. That got us to the 407, and eventually home.<br />
The rest of Sunday was fairly relaxful. We ate dinner with my parents, and later went out to take in a movie (Mystery, Alaska). After the movie, I took Allison on a short tour of Oakville neighbourhoods. Although I often compare Oakville to Nanaimo, I know there are a lot of significant differences. Most notably, the &#8220;scummy&#8221; part.<br />
In Nanaimo, the not-so-nice parts of town are not-so-nice. In Oakville, it&#8217;s Kerr Street. For those of you who don&#8217;t know Oakville, let me provide a simple example as to what Kerr Street is like. Let&#8217;s say your normal scummy part of town is like a beat-up 1974 Ford Pinto. Let&#8217;s say your typical part of Oakville is like a Rolls-Royce. Kerr Street is like a somewhat muddy Chrysler Neon.</p>

		<p>We awoke to the smell of bacon. It must be an instinctual thing &#8212; no human can sleep through the smell of bacon. Your body takes in the smell and promptly yells: &#8220;Get up ya lazy oaf! There&#8217;s bacon to be had! GET UP!&#8221;<br />
Breakfast was huge. Omelettes, bacon, and potatoes. There was also champagne and orange juice (mixed in the stronger-than-usual 1:1 ratio) to wash it all down. When all was said and eaten, we were stuffed beyond belief.<br />
The item of the day was Algonquin Park. Huntsville is a short drive from the massive greenspace, and Allison and I wanted to see it. I&#8217;d never been to Algonquin before (Allison was shocked that I&#8217;d not gone before with friends or family, though that wasn&#8217;t due to lack of interest), and was curious to see what it was like. Allison was itching to see the fall colours (which really don&#8217;t exist here in BC).<br />
The day was warm, so we dressed comfortably. We passed by Huntsville and in just over a half-hour, were entering the south-western entrance to the park. Algonquin Park is huge &#8212; 7,725 square kilometres. Not nearly as large as Wood Buffalo National Park (weighing in at a hefty 44,807 square kilometres), but larger than Prince Albert National Park (3,875 sq. km) and Banff (Bamf!) National Park (6,641 sq. km). We had missed the best time to go through the park (the colour peaked probably a week or two earlier), but it was still magnificent.<br />
After purchasing a day pass from the main gate, we headed for our first stop: Hardwood Trail. This was the shortest one in the park, and was described as &#8220;moderate&#8221;. We took this to mean &#8220;relatively not too bad&#8221;. At only 0.7 kilometres, it didn&#8217;t sound too bad.<br />
In BC, they make trails easy to follow, and will quite frequently build raised platforms and walkways to prevent the trampling and compacting of the ground. In Ontario, they tack little blue circles to trees along the way.<br />
By the time we reached the top of a hill (which gave us a spectacular view over Smoke Lake), we were tired. A lot of it had been crawling up and down hills, carefully walking so you didn&#8217;t plant your foot in a mud pit, and keeping an eye out for rogue tree roots. We passed on any more trails for the day.<br />
We headed further into the park, stopping at the Algonquin Museum about halfway through the park. This gave us an opportunity to view some of the Group of Seven paintings the museum had.<br />
Not far past the museum (still heading east), we realised that we had gone a bit too far, and turned around to head back. Along the way, we stopped at Canoe Lake, site of Tom Thompson&#8217;s tragic death in 1917. The only indication of the lake&#8217;s notoriety was a bronze and blue sign erected near the gift shop and restaurant. I think Allison and I were the only ones who read it.<br />
Following our visit to Canoe Lake, we went into Huntsville, in search of something light to eat. We weren&#8217;t interested in anything heavy &#8212; we were still reeling from the previous night&#8217;s dinner (oh, if we only knew what we were in for). But Ontario is not exactly known for light fare, and certainly not more northern Ontario.<br />
Downtown Huntsville is quite picturesque. It&#8217;s hard to tell if what we saw was genuine, or a carefully constructed charade for the tourists. We drove up the main strip, turned around and headed back (passing my mom and sister in the process) and headed back toward the cottage. We stopped at the Harvey&#8217;s along the way to indulge in a salad.<br />
There were people all over the place when we arrived back at the cottage. As of the previous day, there were 10 people: Cathy, Craig, Dave, Steve, Kathy, Madison (the baby), my parents, Allison, and myself. We now had at least four more (in all honesty, I lost count). So much for a small, cozy Thanksgiving dinner.<br />
Dave had gone overboard with dinner. The turkey was stuffed with apple/raisin/sauage stuffing, there was a ham coated in pineapple/brown sugar glaze (it apparently did a number of the pan), beans that were seemingly cooked in butter (as opposed to water), carrots (the tamest of the items), and mashed potatoes.<br />
No comments about the potatoes, you say? That&#8217;s because it takes a bit to explain them. Take your ordinary potato. Cook a few and mash them with cream and butter. Lots of it. The potatoes should be ultra-creamy. Mix in bacon bits. Real ones. Refrigerate over night. The next morning, scoop out potatoes with an ice cream scoop. Roll the potatoes in flour, then in beaten eggs, then in breading. Deep-fry until the breading is golden brown. Heat in the oven.<br />
I almost wished I hadn&#8217;t learned how those were made. There were sooooo good, but I can never eat them again.<br />
After dinner, we sat around and talked. Craig and Steve set a fire in the back yard. This doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing, until you realise what they were burning: Three mattresses, at least one box spring, several table legs (and possibly the tables), and about 1,000 square feet of carpet.<br />
And this was a small fire. Their other fires have been massive blazes that have actually frightened them. (You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d learn&#8230;) Although I don&#8217;t have hard figures, these are some of the other things these people have burned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two vacuum cleaners</li>
<li>One fibreglass jacuzzi tub</li>
<li>Countless square feet of carpet</li>
<li>Countless board-feet of lumber of all kinds</li>
<li>Leaves. Lots of &#8217;em.</li>
<li>Mattresses. Who knows how many.</li>
<li>27 couches. Yes, 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neighbours don&#8217;t like the cottage group too much.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to three deafening pounds on the bedroom door. Cathy had arrived at the Sowrey homestead, and wasn&#8217;t going to wait for her poor brother (and future sister-in-law) to adjust to the time change. She wanted to start up to the cottage, and she wasn&#8217;t keen on waiting.<br />
The cottage? Cathy&#8217;s significant other (more than a boyfriend, but not quite a husband) owns a cottage just outside of Huntsville. (Huntsville, for those of you without a map, is about 250 kms north of Toronto.) Huntsville&#8217;s claim to fame, aside from being a nice little town, is bringing Shania Twain to the world. She got her start at the Deerhurst Resort, which sits on the eastern edge of town.<br />
Allison and I weren&#8217;t off and running with the bulls that morning, it took us a while to get going. There was a reason for this, of course &#8212; we needed to make a phone call. What&#8217;s so special about that? Well, for one thing, it was to British Columbia, three hours behind Ontario. For another, it would settle our problem with finding a new apartment.<br />
Finally sick to death of the apartment we&#8217;re currently in (lots of noise, endless renovation, and I&#8217;m getting tired of the commute), we started looking for a new place to live. Because of the way our lease is structured, we had to hand in our notice to vacate one month and one day before our last day &#8212; September 30. This was long before we had a place settled.<br />
We had searched high and low through Kitsilano and the West End to find a place. We found a few promising ones, but nothing definite. We were getting a bit uptight about finding an apartment in time before we left for Ontario. Then, on the Tuesday before, we went to see a place in the West End. It sounded promising: Two bedrooms, balcony, view, and a dishwasher. The dishwasher was a big thing for us &#8212; we&#8217;re sick of having our counter space sucked up with a dish rack.<br />
When we arrived, there were several people directly on our heels. It was only because I thought we should get there early that we got there first. Allison whispered in my ear &#8220;we&#8217;ll take it&#8221; after only barely stepping into the apartment. But we had to wait for the manager to show the apartment to two more groups.<br />
The next group bribed her $100 to give the place to them over us. The second group offered $250 more per month. (There were two more groups from Toronto who both offered $350 more than the advertised rent.) I began to understand why prices out here were so out of whack. (In retrospect, Toronto has caught up in the Rent Race as of late.)<br />
We were told that we would find out Thursday morning if we got the apartment. When Thursday morning came, Allison (who accepted the call) discovered that the owner of the apartment (apparently it&#8217;s a condo) was concerned that Allison is self-employed. We&#8217;d expected to run into this problem &#8230; when we bought a house, not renting an apartment. Allison hastily faxed nearly every quasi-financial document that proved she was trustworthy.<br />
The call Friday morning would tell us either A) we got it, or B) we&#8217;d be apartment hunting as soon as we got back. We were hoping it wasn&#8217;t B).<br />
I dialled the management, and asked for Dana, the woman we had been dealing with. (Interesting fact: Almost every single building manager I&#8217;ve dealt with since I got here has been a woman &#8212; only one man.) Her response was: &#8220;Are you ready to sign the contract that says you&#8217;ll take me for two weeks of the year?&#8221;<br />
This is Dana&#8217;s little joke &#8212; she thinks the view at our new apartment is great, and joked that she would like to stay there two weeks of the year when she&#8217;s retired. It&#8217;s harmless &#8230; I hope.<br />
So that brings me to a new point: Our new address information. You might want to jot this down&#8230;<br />
[Information not available on the web. Sorry&#8230;]<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
The whole famn damily (as my dad would say) was going to up to the cottage. Allison and I would pick up my sister, and my parents would drive up in the RoadTrek. We&#8217;d meet either in Huntsville, or at Weber&#8217;s (if we got there at the same time).<br />
Following the simple directions, Allison and I arrived at my sister&#8217;s house. Yes, house. She owns a house with Craig (hence the more-than-boyfriend, not-quite-husband designation). It&#8217;s a nice place, it just needs a little bit of work to make it their own &#8212; they&#8217;ve only been there a couple of months.<br />
And off we went. I drove for the first bit, about 80% of the trip. This took us north of Toronto, through Barrie and Orillia, and finally to Weber&#8217;s, home of the best burgers in Ontario (and possibly the world). As we blitzed north, we passed my parents, who then engaged in a game of &#8220;keep up with the children&#8221;. We met for lunch.<br />
Weber&#8217;s is a landmark in the Muskokas. Everyone travelling north of Orillia on Highway 11 knows about Weber&#8217;s. You can&#8217;t miss it. It&#8217;s the only hamburger joint with it&#8217;s own bridge across the highway (the bridge is the only privately-owned bridge (or walkway) across a highway in Canada &#8212; bought from the CN Tower in the early 80&#8217;s). They serve up to over 110,000 people in one month (up to over 6,000 in one day).<br />
Yes, they&#8217;re *that* good. That&#8217;s why the bridge is there &#8212; to get the southbound traffic.<br />
We arrived at the cottage around 3pm in the afternoon, and were promptly presented with with draught beers. They have a beer fridge, complete with taps in the front. The beer fridge did not last long, however, it was moved downstairs to make room for the pool table.<br />
In turn, the power drill came out. Two holes were bored &#8212; one in the floor, the other in a post that supported the loft. They ran a clear plastic hose from the beer fridge in the basement, up through the floor, and into a beer tap that now occupied the hole in the support post. Beer now flowed from the basement to the kitchen.<br />
(Ever seen those beer commercials where a bunch of 20-somethings romp around in this mythical cottage lifestyle? I think we found the model cottage for those commercials.)<br />
The cottage is two floors, with a loft. The main floor is the kitchen/living and dining area. There are no walls. Except for the ones around the bathroom (kind of a necessity). Downstairs are most of the beds, with walls separating most of the areas, and one room that holds Steve, Kathy, and their baby. The loft is accessed from the living area up a fairly steep ladder. There are numerous mattresses up there, capable of sleeping a large number of people.<br />
Dinner that evening was a roast &#8212; nothing horribly fancy, other than it was a roast. (This was a cottage &#8212; I was expecting hot dogs and hamburgers, maybe a steak.) It came with roasted potatoes and fresh vegetables. All courtesy of &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave.<br />
(There are two, actually three, Daves at this cottage. &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave comes from, you guessed it, Scarborough. This is not to confuse him with &#8220;Huntsville&#8221; Dave, who lives just down the road. The third Dave is my dad. He doesn&#8217;t need a prefix for his name though, he&#8217;s just &#8220;Dave&#8221;.)<br />
Anyway, Scarborough Dave is a cook &#8212; used to own a restaurant. He loves cooking, or so it seems. (Cathy told us that they eat far too well at the cottage.) The meal was quite tasty, but nothing compared to what awaited us the following night.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Allison was supposed to call me when she got downtown. I was a bit concerned that it was 2:00pm, and I hadn&#8217;t heard from her. I was supposed to pick her up at 2:00 at the Stadium Skytrain station. We still had to go over to Kitsilano, pick up a wad of business cards, drive to the airport, park the car, check the bags, eat, and get on the plane. By 4:00pm. Time was running short.<br />
I was half-way to the car when my cell phone rang. I was happy I&#8217;d ducked out when I did. A few minutes later, we were on our way to Kits. One of Allison&#8217;s friends (a graphic designer) had made new cards for Allison, but had left them at her friend&#8217;s place (Allison&#8217;s friend had already left on vacation). We stopped only long enough to pick them up and head towards Granville Street.<br />
The trip down was uneventful. We dropped the car off at the Park N&#8217; Fly, hopped a shuttle, and arrived at the terminal just after 3:00pm. So far, everything was going like clockwork. Figures we&#8217;d be the ones to find the broken gear.<br />
Something told us that we were in for trouble when we stepped up to the counter. I said &#8220;virtual ticket&#8221;, and the clerk&#8217;s eyes glazed over. Even after we&#8217;d produced our identification, it took nearly 20 minutes to check us in. Colour me unimpressed. Allison was convinced this twit didn&#8217;t know how to use a computer. Everything was punched in with two fingers, and it took no less than five minutes to print the lousy boarding pass!<br />
Finally, the luggage accepted, we made a bee-line for Harvey&#8217;s, and some much-needed food. All would have gone well, except for the guy in front of me who ordered nearly everything on the menu. Luckily, Allison was a while getting her magazine, so I finished about the same time she got back.<br />
We weren&#8217;t late arriving at the gate, but the general boarding call was long since called. I felt sorry for the poor woman sitting on the aisle of our row. I think I hit her twice with my bag, and stepped on her toe. I don&#8217;t like having to take two bags on a plane &#8212; too inconvenient.<br />
The flight was pleasant: faster than usual, quite smooth, a good in-flight movie (&#8220;Swing&#8221;), and decent meals. Well, almost decent. Although Canadian Airlines now has much more flavourful meals, they&#8217;ve skimped on a few things. Take dessert for example: It was a Halloween-sized Toblerone bar. What happened to the apple crisp, eh? Or the (somewhat disgusting) cheesecakes?<br />
And the butter. Hello, what&#8217;s wrong with butter? No, they had to give us Becel. Not even decent margarine, but Becel. Blech! It&#8217;s bad enough that I can&#8217;t eat salted peanuts on the flight anymore, but I can&#8217;t have butter now. What is this world coming to?<br />
We arrived in Toronto at 11:00pm EDT, about 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The idea was to grab the bags, grab a taxi, and head home. My dad, however, beat us to it, nearly scaring Allison half to death as we waited for our luggage.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several weeks ago, we received an invitation to a gala event in the Okanagan for one of Allison&#8217;s friends, Heather. She was getting married to her significant other, Brian. We were asked to attend the three-day event in Naramata. (Naramata is, for lack of any better description, suburban Penticton. Penticton, just in case you&#8217;re looking on a map, is at the south end of Okanagan Lake, about 30-40 minutes from Kelowna.)<br />
Allison was considered part of Heather&#8217;s inner circle of friends &#8212; she attended the shower and the stag parties. Now the question you are undoubtedly asking is: How does Allison know Heather? (Okay, maybe you&#8217;re not, but it&#8217;s still interesting.) A couple of years ago, Allison was enrolled in the Young Entrepreneurs Program, of which Heather was the instructor. Yes, Allison was Heather&#8217;s student. One of Heather&#8217;s other friends described Allison as Heather&#8217;s &#8220;most favouritest student&#8221;. (In actuality, Allison often helped in the class, as she was frequently bored with the lack of stimulating or challenging material.)<br />
So from student to peer, Allison was called upon to travel to the Okanagan and witness matrimonial bliss. With a &#8220;guest&#8221;, of course. We took it upon ourselves to use the situation as research for our own event, currently aimed at mid-summer next year (we&#8217;re still working on the exact date).<br />
Because the event was for three days, we hoped we might be able to save a little money by staying a night at Chateau Tisdale in Kelowna. Luckily, the Chateau&#8217;s owners were very accommodating, and loaned us use of the house, even though they were going to Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park.<br />
I love my relatives.<br />
So on Friday afternoon, we threw our things into Allison&#8217;s &#8217;87 Toyota Corolla, shifted in gear, and headed directly to the Bay. I needed a shirt for the event, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to buy one yet. It was a nice light aquamarine (as close a colour as I can think of) and a tie (yes, a tie) to go with it. Then we were off &#8230; once we dropped off a library book.<br />
We drove until we reached outer Abbotsford, at which time we filled up on gas. It was a long drive to Kelowna, and the last think you want to have happen is run out of gas between Hope and Merritt &#8212; 120 kilometres of zilch civilization, and $20/litre gasoline. No, I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; tow trucks will charge you that much, because there&#8217;s no other place to get it.<br />
Aside from a quick stop in Hope to obtain a small dinner, our next stop was in Merritt, where we were in need of something to drink. After you spend a significant amount of time on the coast, you&#8217;ll find your body requires more and more liquid when travelling in drier climates.<br />
As we departed Kelowna, I got a chance to look up at the sky Allison had commented on earlier. It was cool and clear that night &#8212; the clearest sky I have seen in over a decade. And dark. It was so dark that for the first time in since-I-don&#8217;t-know-when, I saw the Milky Way. Across the sky is usually a large whitish band, where we can see the rest of the galaxy. City lights drown it out completely &#8230; but not at 1,100 metres in the dead of night. We pulled over for a while and stared up at the night sky.<br />
Kelowna was cold when we arrived, barely in the teens (we were used to low 20s back in Vancouver). After finding the key stashed in the backyard, we found the house wasn&#8217;t much warmer. It seems my relatives had turned the heat off. Fine with me, as we were getting free accommodation. It just made using certain objects in the house (particularly those in the bathroom) a bit on the &#8230; breathtaking side.<br />
We rose late the night morning, groggy from our long trip. After quick romps through the shower, we headed out to find something to eat. Despite the fact that Kelowna is a neat little resort town, it has one little problem &#8212; a lot of things don&#8217;t open until later in the day. We had hoped to have Mexican for lunch. The only Mexican place we could find didn&#8217;t open until 4:00pm. We ended up at the Earl&#8217;s, overlooking the lake.<br />
Earl&#8217;s isn&#8217;t known for speed. This particular restaurant was stuck in what appeared to be an extension of the Kansas Interspatial Distortion (see Observer&#8217;s Log: Volume 3), where time slowed to a crawl. It took nearly an hour and a half to order, eat, and get our bill. We were 20 minutes late getting to &#8220;Salmon on the Beach&#8221;.<br />
This was the first of three wedding-related events (actually, four, if you count the ceremony and reception as separate). This was the get-together for all the people involved (including guests) in the wedding. There were between 120 and 150 people, but exact numbers were impossible to guess, because we didn&#8217;t know who was a guest and who wasn&#8217;t.<br />
Allison and I were among the youngest in the group, and felt mostly like outsiders. However, we were quickly welcomed by Heather&#8217;s mom, aunt, soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, and numerous other people. We certainly didn&#8217;t feel like outsiders by the end.<br />
The families had commandeered a park in the corner of Naramata, where they set up volleyball nets, horseshoe pits, picnic tables (all courtesy of the town), and food &#8230; lots and lots of food. All of it homemade. Grilled salmon, caught fresh in Port Alberni, along with fresh corn on the cob, salads of nearly every kind, and lots of fresh vegetables. Dessert was a selection of pies made from nearly every imaginable fruit. If you could fend off the wasps long enough, it was a good meal. (No-one was stung, to the best of my knowledge.)<br />
One of the more unexpected events was marked with a sign, reading &#8220;Irish Jigging&#8221;. They were referring to dancing, of course. Problem: &#8220;Jig&#8221; is a word used by the British to describe the Irish dancing. It does not mean the same thing in Ireland. In fact, it refers to the act of procreation. Not exactly what those who wrote the sign had in mind.<br />
We stayed until it was difficult to see the people playing volleyball. It was also so cold we could actually start seeing our breath (of course, that could have been from sucking in too much smoke from the bonfire). Apparently, the volleyball players continued to the point where they couldn&#8217;t see the ball.<br />
On the way back, we debated on what to do with the remainder of the evening. Both of us decided that a movie was in order. We hoped to be back in downtown Kelowna in time for a movie, but we weren&#8217;t certain we could make it. Luckily for us, we passed by the Westbank Caprice Theatres, which was showing a wide range of movies. Opting for the immediate guarantee of a movie, we stopped.<br />
We ended up seeing a rather appropriate film, insofar as the basic event that was to take place the following day &#8212; Runaway Bride, starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Given, we didn&#8217;t expect to see Heather making a 100 metre dash away from the altar the next day, but we figured it would be good for a laugh.<br />
I&#8217;d just like to go on record: I didn&#8217;t suggest the movie. I merely agreed to it.<br />
Twenty dollars and two hours of our lives that we&#8217;ll never see again (Allison and I hit the &#8220;why are we watching this drivel&#8221; point at the same time, however we also realized that we had nothing else better to do, so we stayed and watched), we returned home, and promptly passed out.<br />
We were off and running early the next morning, making a direct hit on the De Dutch Pannekoek house. It was an experiment the both of us had been interested in performing. We had heard good things about the place, and thought it might be good for a test run. All in all, our spur-of-the-moment decisions to try something that weekend turned out fairly lousy &#8230; the breakfast included.<br />
I dropped Allison off at home, and quickly made a run to the Summerhill Winery, about a kilometre or so away from Chateau Tisdale. I figured that the loan of the entire house was worth at least two bottles of nice wine. Sadly, our once-favourite winery was nearly out of stock (the fall wine season is just about to start, and the spring lineup is almost gone). Remembering the St. Hubertus Winery not too far away, I made a hasty exit to check there.<br />
As usual, the St. Hubertus Winery was empty &#8230; of people, that is. It&#8217;s one of those little treasures that not many people know about. I knew exactly was I was looking for: a bottle of Oak Bay Gamay Noir (a very tasty red) and a recommended white wine. I learned something that day: Ageing wine in oak barrels means a lot. St. Hubertus has two flavours of Gamay Noir &#8212; one aged in stainless steel, the other in oak. The oak tastes significantly better. If the label says &#8220;Vinters Reserve&#8221;, you&#8217;ve got the *wrong* one.<br />
Returning after 20 minutes, toting two bottles of wine, I quickly got to work getting ready to leave. That meant showering, shaving, packing, and taking the wrinkles out of my new shirt. That was a challenge that completely amazed me. It took forever. Finally, after much work, the wrinkles were mostly removed, and we darted out the door. We were a bit pressed for time.<br />
The wedding was at 3:30 (or so said the invitation). That meant moving quickly, as it takes an hour (at least) to get from Kelowna to Naramata. This is mostly because of the zillion or so curves and dips along Naramata Road. Luckily, we were provided with a map that gave us the location. After thinking we might have got lost (we weren&#8217;t alone on that point), we found Heather&#8217;s grandparent&#8217;s house, half-way up the side of the mountain.<br />
Wow.<br />
Let me repeat that &#8212; wow.<br />
A nicer home, I have not seen. I couldn&#8217;t tell you when it was built, but someone made a careful plan to make sure that every possible vista was exploited. There isn&#8217;t one square inch on that property, in or out of the house, that doesn&#8217;t have a killer view.<br />
The ceremony was held on the spacious driveway/walkway that overlooked the lake and surrounding hillsides. Although it had been raining all day, the sun&#8217;s appearance only 30 minutes before was making the event a very memorable one.<br />
Brian and his entourage appeared roughly 10 minutes after we arrived, followed by Heather about five minutes later. The ceremony itself was short, lasting only about 15 minutes in total length. That&#8217;s not including the &#8220;intermission&#8221; in the middle, where Brian and Heather went off to sign the marriage licence, then returning to finish the ceremony. A little strange, if you ask me.<br />
Afterwards, we got into a receiving line to greet the wedding party and the newlyweds. This something that Allison and I are considering avoiding. It&#8217;s a long, drawn out detail that uses a lot of time that we think could be put to better use &#8230; like pictures, or getting from Point A to Point B (this all depends on where we have our photos taken, of course).<br />
Punch and hors d&#8217;oeuvres followed. Then it was back to Penticton for the reception at the Ramada. This gave us some time to whip through our hotel and drop our things off. We had checked in on our way up to Naramata, but didn&#8217;t want to spend the time unloading items. Not that it really mattered&#8230;<br />
The reception was more research for us. Allison had me take pictures of the cake, head table, and one of the guest tables for reference. We also realized that the room isn&#8217;t that big an issue &#8212; it really doesn&#8217;t dominate the atmosphere. We thought about how we would arrange people, where we would put food, what kind of drinks we would serve (and where we&#8217;d get them), and so on and so on.<br />
Our table mates included a couple who were loosely related to Heather (no blood relation at all, but were nonetheless a valued part of the family), named Micki and Donald. Yes, you read that right. They commented on the oddness of the two names. We noted it was a little weird that they didn&#8217;t go by something like Mick and Don. But hey &#8212; they&#8217;re not us.<br />
The dinner was quite nice, including a couple of salads (green, potato, and pasta), chicken kiev, roast beef, and buns. The cake was delicious, even though I had no idea what it was.<br />
When it finally came time to dance, the silliness started. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that about 50% of those attending were sufficiently inebriated. One in particular, one of Brian&#8217;s friends, claimed he was &#8220;a professional alcoholic&#8221;. This, as he bought nine beers and two rum and cokes (he was using up $50 he didn&#8217;t want to convert before returning to Ireland).<br />
Anyway, back to the dancing. Lots of people danced silly dances, including the dreaded &#8220;Chicken Dance&#8221;. That&#8217;s #1 of the top 10 songs I will try with all my might to keep out of our wedding. The Macarena comes in at #2. They played that, too. Dance I did not, owing to the severe pain my shoes were inflicting on my left little toe. Mental note for next year: Do not wear sandals in the week prior to the wedding &#8212; my toes are a little too splayed to fit into dress shoes properly.<br />
The reception ended around 1am, at which time we returned to our motel, and hit the sack.<br />
The next morning was supposed to be the brunch, where all those involved could scarf down a tasty way to start the day. We thought about the traffic we would face, and opted instead to get a head start on the mayhem. We didn&#8217;t avoid the idiots, though, nearly missing one such idiot as he tried to pass another car on a hill, with us next to a cliff. We had a maximum of two feet to spare between us. It really got the ol&#8217; heart pumping.<br />
The trip back signified the end of summer. As we climbed through the mountains, we noticed that it was dark and dreary &#8212; just what winter looks like around here. Then it started to rain. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, it&#8217;s only water. After a moment, I noticed that the rain wasn&#8217;t splattering like rain &#8230; it was sleet. Not even before I said: &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s sleet!&#8221; did the sleet become snow. Not just a little snow, a *lot* of snow. So much snow that the windshield wipers gummed up, and we accumulated a bit on the car.<br />
Yes folks, when you see snow falling around you, you know summer&#8217;s over.<br />
We drove until we reached Abbotsford, where we pulled off for lunch. Again, our trend of turtle-paced service continued, for what reason we didn&#8217;t know. After an hour, we resumed our trek west.<br />
Our option to leave early paid off, we avoided the traffic we had dreaded. We pulled into our parking garage, and let Allison&#8217;s car recover from its 1000+ km journey. The drive probably did it well, though &#8212; it&#8217;s primarily used for city driving.<br />
That evening, we went downtown to witness Mary, a band fronted by the sister of one of Allison&#8217;s friends. It was a good show, save for the volume differential between the drummer and the vocals (namely the former mostly drowned out the latter). Then it was home for a rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Stress. I hate it. It sucks the life right out of me, and leaves nothing but exhaustion and bad moods. In short, I don&#8217;t do well under a large amount of it for a long period of time. And when you consider that I haven&#8217;t been working weekends, I&#8217;m really wondering how I survived at Arkipelago for so long without going loony.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much the direction I&#8217;m headed in now &#8212; loony. Rather, I was, until the weekend. I&#8217;ve been busting my rear as of late &#8230; actually, as of the last two months, trying to get about a dozen projects to completion. Of prominence was the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit report. It&#8217;s worth about 3/4 of a million to us, so needless to say, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure to get it done.<br />
And that&#8217;s the problem &#8212; pressure. I&#8217;m under way too much of it. So much so that I haven&#8217;t slept well in more weeks than I can remember, and what little time I&#8217;ve had all to myself has been taken up by commuting from home to work and back.<br />
I need a vacation. Badly.<br />
Regrettably, my vacation won&#8217;t likely come until early October, when I plan to make a visit home. So until then, I take my rest time whenever I can get it. To compensate for my most recent bout of near-crazed stress, Allison and I opted to visit the Island for the weekend.<br />
Unlike our usual habit, we drove the car to the Island (via the ferry, of course). We caught the last ferry out of Vancouver, which unlike normal, was full of people returning from the PNE. Not a total surprise &#8212; getting to the PNE from the Island is a bit difficult, but not impossible for the determined.<br />
We arrived at the Collins&#8217; just around 11:30pm, at which time we sat down and talked for a while. Jane arrived after not too long, said &#8220;Hello&#8221; and promptly vanished. Randy came home not long after Jane, but stayed around to talk. Before long, it was well after 2:00am, and we were ready to pass out.<br />
The next morning, the house was virtually empty. The Collins were out with friends, and Allison&#8217;s siblings were nowhere to be found. It was time for us to vacate for our excursion of the day.<br />
The West Coast. Since I arrived in Vancouver in January of 1998, I hadn&#8217;t been to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Sounds a little odd, perhaps? While the Island is not very wide (only a hundred kilometres or so), there is no direct east-west highway. This is because of a small mountain problem.<br />
Getting to Tofino (one of our ultimate destinations) from Nanaimo requires a drive to Parkville, then to Port Alberni, then to Ucuelet, and finally to Tofino. All in all, it&#8217;s about 250 kilometres. There&#8217;s no way to do that in less than three hours.<br />
Unless you&#8217;re a raving lunatic, of course.<br />
The drive to Port Alberni is nice and easy &#8212; I&#8217;ve done most of it before (it&#8217;s the same route to Cathedral Grove). But once you&#8217;re out of Port Alberni, you&#8217;re into rough country. The roads weave, rise and fall like a roller coaster. The only difference is that you&#8217;re not attached to the track, and you have to deal with trains going in the opposite direction and trains trying to run you off the road.<br />
Since I&#8217;ve arrived here, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that BC has some of the worst drivers in Canada. At least in Montreal, everyone expects you to drive like a maniac. Many people have suggested that &#8220;flat-landers&#8221; (aka everyone who came from east of the Rockies) can&#8217;t drive here &#8212; they drive too fast, they take turns to quickly, yadda yadda yadda. Given, I see a lot of out-of-province license plates on cars driving so fast it would make Mario Andretti queasy. But my general fear is of the freaks that are living in this province.<br />
Anyway, we managed to finally get to Ucuelet shortly after 2:00pm. Starving, we found our way to a small grocery store to purchase snacks. We had thought of a restaurant, but Ucuelet (population: 5) isn&#8217;t well-stocked with interesting places to eat.<br />
Okay, all seriousness aside, Ucuelet is a nice place. To visit. I wouldn&#8217;t want to live there. Allison&#8217;s cousin, however, does. Her husband is the town planner. You might think: &#8220;Why would a town that small require a town planner?&#8221; The answer to that is our second destination: Tofino.<br />
Tofino was once like Ucuelet &#8212; small. Tiny. A blip on the map that you couldn&#8217;t get to without traversing gravel logging roads. It was an ordeal that few took. Then the government (bless their souls) paved the aforementioned logging road, and designated it Highway 4. Suddenly, getting from one side of the Island to the other was a bit easier. And Tofino was conveniently situated not far from Long Beach, which has some of the best surfing in Canada.<br />
That&#8217;s why Tofino got bigger. It got big fast. According to many who told me, Tofino also sprawled. It went commercial. It didn&#8217;t have that &#8220;west coast feel&#8221;. Ucuelet, only 40 kilometres away (and much closer to the Highway to Civilization) opted not to become an eyesore. Hence, the town planner.<br />
That being said, we figured Tofino had more to offer in terms of lunch, albeit a late one. So off we went.<br />
Between Ucuelet and Tofino is Pacific Rim National Park. It protects Long Beach and the surrounding area. There are several areas to visit in the park, but on that particular day, we were only interested in getting to Tofino.<br />
At first, I thought we had arrived in the outer limits of the town. From what others had told me, Tofino was a sprawling mess. I expected McDonald&#8217;s restaurants, gas stations &#8212; all the tacky stuff you&#8217;d expect to see in a tourist town. Frankly, I&#8217;d love to know what everyone complains about.<br />
Tofino is &#8230; quaint. Yes, quaint is exactly the word I&#8217;d use. It&#8217;s small, compact, with no real &#8220;strip&#8221; to speak of. It takes about a minute to travel from one side to the other. Then you&#8217;ve seen it, and you can move on with life.<br />
Tofino is more-or-less in the centre of Clayquot Sound. Name sound familiar? Remember all the protests a few years back? This was one of the centres for the protesters. Clayquot Sound has a lot of temperate rainforest &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest in North America, logged areas not included. It&#8217;s also the wettest &#8230; 20 feet a year. Luckily, we only got drizzled on.<br />
Lunch being the major concern, we drove around briefly (like I said, the town is small), until we spotted the Sea Shanty. Perhaps not the most elegant name, but they serve a mean shrimp caesar wrap. Not that I ate one &#8212; Allison did, complete with the fanciest salad I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. I opted for a rather large bowl of clam chowder (not that I had the intention of ordering a large bowl, it just came that way) and a small caesar salad. Both of us were quite content with our meals, especially considering how cheap they were.<br />
So, there&#8217;s my commercial for this issue &#8212; if you&#8217;re in Tofino and you&#8217;re hungry, go for the Sea Shanty.<br />
Afterwards, we wandered about a bit, checking out some of the local stores, before we ended up at the Eagle Aerie Gallery. This is Roy H. Vickers&#8217; personal art gallery. Roy Vickers is possibly one of the most famous (living) artists on the West Coast. He lives and works here, living in some remote town on the Island, with his gallery in Tofino.<br />
He&#8217;s a Tsimshian artist who creates beautiful artwork with Native themes. His artwork frequently requires the use of special lighting so you get the full effect (sometimes you can&#8217;t see a feature unless you&#8217;re looking in the right angle). Allison and I would love to buy a print of his, except we can&#8217;t spare the $3000.<br />
Upon exiting, Allison suggested we go to Long Beach. The sun was beginning to break through the oppressive cloud cover, so a trip to the beach seemed like a good idea.<br />
Long Beach is aptly named &#8212; it&#8217;s a few miles in length. But don&#8217;t be mistaken &#8212; this isn&#8217;t your average beach. In fact, this isn&#8217;t your average coast. The west coast of Vancouver Island is quite dangerous. There are vicious rip currents, rogue waves, and storms that make The Blair Witch Project look like Barney and Friends reunion. Many people are killed each year who don&#8217;t heed warnings or take the right precautions.<br />
The water is also cold. About 52F (11C) degrees. Unless you&#8217;re wearing a wetsuit, it&#8217;s not the sort of thing you want to be splashing around in for any length of time. Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop Allison or I from romping around the waves &#8230; so long as they didn&#8217;t pass our knees.<br />
But even at such a shallow depth, you can feel the rip current. Normally, when you stand in the sand where waves hit the beach, the sand under your feet is eaten away and you sink. That effect is very pronounced at Long Beach. Still, there were many people out surfing in the waves.<br />
We stayed only about 45 minutes, realising that if we stayed much longer, it would be dark by the time we got back to Nanaimo &#8212; and the trip back isn&#8217;t one you want to take in the dark.<br />
We stopped for a short while in Port Alberni, partially because we wanted to see the infamous channel. This is a large fjord that runs more than half-way into Vancouver Island. Originally, it didn&#8217;t quite go all the way through to Port Alberni, but some simple dredging and blasting took care of that. Now Port Alberni is actually a shipping port, allowing ships to avoid the bottlenecks at Vancouver Harbour.<br />
Returning to Nanaimo, we found we were unable to find a restaurant to suit our culinary desires. As such, we ended up back at the Collins, ordering Domino&#8217;s Pizza. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, of course.<br />
The next morning, I was awakened by the sound of a ringing telephone. At the time I didn&#8217;t know it, but it was in fact Allison doing a loop-back call with the phone so she wouldn&#8217;t have to go downstairs and wake me up. She was lucky that I was ready to get up anyway &#8212; I would&#8217;ve probably gone back to sleep, otherwise.<br />
We were out of the house about five minutes later, heading to Wellington Hall. Mrs. Collins wanted to experiment with some ideas for the wedding.<br />
Oh yeah, you probably wonder about that, eh? We put it off, due to some extenuating circumstances, and have rescheduled for next year, either in late July or early September (August is out due to Allison&#8217;s cousin, who is also getting married), depending on whether Allison decides to do her Masters or not.<br />
We&#8217;ll let you know.<br />
Anyway, we then ended up in Wedding Research mode, visiting several places around Nanaimo before finally giving up for the day. Still not enough decisions, but we&#8217;re not too pressed for time.<br />
Getting home was another issue. We hoped to make the 7pm ferry &#8230; along with about 500 other cars. We ended up in a line the lengths of which I hadn&#8217;t even imagined, let alone experienced. Surprisingly enough, it went fairly quickly, and we managed to make the special 8pm sailing (BC Ferries will run periodic special runs when traffic is high).<br />
It was a Fast Ferry. Yay. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as our previous experience, but then again, the Fast Ferry excels at the Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay run &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have to turn around.<br />
Soon, we were home, resting up for another week of solid work. Next week &#8212; off to Naramata for a wedding. Yep, another log entry&#8217;s a-coming&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another birthday has come and gone, and save for a minor panic attack when I realised I wasn&#8217;t 21 anymore (yes, that <em>actually</em> happened, believe it or not), I&#8217;m doing okay.<br />
Things got off to a start on Friday, when Pure3D (my group at the office) went out to celebrate two birthdays &#8212; mine (obviously), and Neall, who is exactly one day older than me. (Although Neall&#8217;s birthday was the day before, we really didn&#8217;t get our act in gear to go out for lunch that day; we rolled two birthdays into one.)<br />
I was supposed to go to a softball game that night, but I opted not to go, rather wanting to spend some time with Allison doing something other than sitting at home, working on the computer or watching a movie. (No, we haven&#8217;t been out a lot as of late.)<br />
After making a quick trip to Burnaby to pick up Allison, we came downtown to go to our favourite Greek restaurant, Olympia, on Denman St. (Yes, Allison could have come downtown and saved me the trip, but I didn&#8217;t make up my mind until I got home.) Tyler joined us towards the end of our evening meal (having already had his dinner).<br />
The three of us wandered about the Denman Street area for a while, before ending up at Death By Chocolate for dessert. (It&#8217;s actually kiddie-corner to Olympia, but we didn&#8217;t want to stuff ourselves any fuller at the time.) Following dessert, we adjourned to Tyler&#8217;s place to continue with our in-depth conversation. Unfortunately, we strayed back onto the dreaded Theory of Relativity issue (see [[Canada Day in Kelowna, Winery Tours, and Penticton]]).<br />
The next morning, we headed out on our adventure of the day. For my birthday, Allison was taking me on the Royal Hudson. The Royal Hudson is a train of vintage cars driven by a steam-powered locomotive built in 1940. The locomotive is a 4-6-4 Hudson, number 2860. King George VI was very impressed by the locomotive&#8217;s performance when he and Queen Elizabeth (aka the Queen Mother) travelled across Canada by train in 1939. He bestowed the designation of &#8220;Royal&#8221; on the engine.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what they tell tourists. In reality, CP applied for permission to use the royal crowns and the &#8220;Royal&#8221; moniker to increase revenues by promoting a &#8220;royal&#8221; train. In fact, the entire 2860 class (numbers 2860-2864) all had the designation &#8220;Royal&#8221;.<br />
Despite its Royal lineage, the locomotive was taken out of service in the 50s, and put on freight service until the mid-60s. At that point, she was destined for museums. In the early 70s, enthusiasts convinced BC Rail that they should resurrect the Royal Hudson, and put it into regular service as a tourist train. The Royal Hudson now runs between May and October, running a short length of BC Rail&#8217;s track (BC Rail is the third largest Canadian railway after CP and CN) between North Vancouver and Squamish.<br />
We arrived about 15 minutes before departure, and hastily took our place on board in the end car, where we would have brunch. A few minutes later, the train softly lurched forward, and we were off.<br />
This part of the trip I had been on before &#8212; Allison had taken me on the Pacific Starlight last year (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]). Unlike the Starlight, however, this was a day-time excursion, and the trip ended in Squamish, not in Porteau Cove.<br />
Brunch began with a fruit cup, made of chunks of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple. We finished the cup just before entering West Vancouver. Apparently, we weren&#8217;t supposed to eat while waving to all the onlookers.<br />
The Royal Hudson, like most steam trains, attracts a lot of attention, even if the train makes two trips through West Van every day. It&#8217;s the only train allowed to blow its whistle. Another bizarre bylaw makes everyone wave at the train as it goes by, which forces everyone on the train to wave back.<br />
As we approached Horseshoe Bay, we were treated to the entrée: A large piece of freshly broiled salmon (it was about 1.5&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 5&#8243; in size). It rested on a thin slice of fresh focaccia bread, over a baby green salad with basalmic vinaigrette. The salmon was very good. Allison debated over whether it was better than last year&#8217;s salmon. It was certainly different &#8212; Allison thought it was better, whereas I thought it was on par; I thought last year&#8217;s fish was excellent.<br />
Dessert arrived around Porteau Cove &#8212; trifle. Unlike my father&#8217;s, which has a bottle of brandy (or sherry &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember which is it) at the bottom, this was cake, fruit, and custard. It was very tasty. This isn&#8217;t to say that my father&#8217;s trifle isn&#8217;t tasty &#8212; goodness knows he *loves* it &#8212; but this one was alcohol-free.<br />
Arriving in Squamish, we had several options. BC Rail makes a point of flogging the tourism on the Royal Hudson as much as possible. They even go so far as to hire tour operators to come on board and convince people to go on tours around Squamish, including a trip to Shannon Falls, a river-rafting tour, or flights over the nearby glacier. All of them are designed to fit into the two hours you have before the train departs.<br />
We opted for the tour that came with the price of the ticket &#8212; a visit to the West Coast Railway Heritage Museum, operated by the West Coast Railway Association. To get there, we piled into a vintage 1950s bus, which had scarcely put on 170,000 miles, and were whisked away to a train-lover&#8217;s paradise.<br />
The WCRHM is a 12 acre park, not far from the downtown terminus for Squamish. It sits just to the side of the main north-south BC Rail lines, facilitating easy delivery of new acquisitions.<br />
The park has many examples of old rolling stock (rail cars, passenger cars) and locomotives. It has the only remaining PGE steam train (the other two are lying at the bottom of lakes), one of the original diesel locomotives used to haul CP&#8217;s Canadian transcontinental train, and even a vintage 1890 business car (the equivalent of today&#8217;s LearJets).<br />
Trains aren&#8217;t Allison&#8217;s cup of tea, that much I&#8217;m certain of. But she let me have my day, even allowing me the joy of riding on a miniature railway (which cost a mere dollar per person). I enjoyed the whole day so much, I&#8217;m seriously considering joining the WCRA as a volunteer. Railways are a huge part of our modern society&#8217;s past, and I want to help them have a future.<br />
Filing back onto another bus, we returned to the Royal Hudson at about 1:15. As we couldn&#8217;t board until 1:30, I took the opportunity to take some pictures of the engine and the train. In fact, I took an entire roll of film that day. (Those of you who don&#8217;t know me that well should know that this isn&#8217;t an unusual thing for me &#8212; I tend to be a bit shutter-happy.)<br />
The return trip was almost as good as the trip up. This time, we were one car behind the engine. The whole way back, I could hear the chugging of the engine. Several times I went to the vestibules (the &#8220;doors&#8221; to enter the cars from the platform) to stick my head out and listen. I&#8217;m still washing out bits of sand and carbon from my hair&#8230;<br />
I was almost disappointed when we arrived back in North Vancouver, the trip over. Those trips always seem to go too quickly. We climbed down from the train, and make our way towards our car. The next stop was Horseshoe Bay, and off to the Island.<br />
Arriving at the Bay, I quickly noticed a problem &#8212; there was very little parking. In fact, after dropping off Allison and driving around a bit, I realised that there was no parking at all. Impark (the parking Nazis in the Lower Mainland) had even gone so far as to deny ferry passengers parking rights at one of the major lots.<br />
At first, I didn&#8217;t think we would make that ferry. Parking was limited. Luckily for us, at the time I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d make it, the ferry traffic was beginning to clear out. In other words, parking spots. Unluckily for us, it was in the most expensive lot: $10 a day.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo, we were picked up by the Collins (as usual) and taken home. Allison and I then stepped out for a while for dinner, allowing me to develop the pictures I&#8217;d taken earlier in the day.<br />
Returning home, I was ambushed by the Collins with a steam locomotive-shaped chocolate cake. Yes, I was a very happy camper that night. I had everything I wanted for my birthday &#8230; except my own family and friends, that is. Luckily for me, most of them sent me cards (both the traditional and the newer electronic variety).<br />
The next day was the day we had come to the Island for: The Comox Air Show. No, this is not a regular Collins (or Vailmont) family event. The only reason we were going (in fact, the only reason I knew there was a Comox Air Show) was Allison&#8217;s uncle Sean.<br />
Sgt. Sean Moran is one of an elite skydiving team called the &#8220;Skyhawks&#8221;. They&#8217;re the parachuting equivalent to the Snowbirds. Sean was one of eight people selected for a year&#8217;s service with the squad. Since May, he&#8217;s been jumping all over North America, including a drop in Oakville on 22 June.<br />
Piling into the Collins&#8217; Honda, we hit the road for the 1.5 hour trip to Comox. Upon arriving, we had another 1.5 hour wait until we got in. Unfortunately, we had taken the &#8220;front&#8221; door route &#8212; the one that was clearly marked. This was the &#8220;opposite&#8221; route to how Gerry and I had gone two years ago &#8212; the &#8220;back&#8221; route.<br />
So, along with about 10,000 other cars, we waited our turn to get into CFB Comox&#8217; field. At one point, we sat for a long time without moving. At first, I thought it was because there were complete idiots who didn&#8217;t know how to organise traffic. I would later find out it was because Allison&#8217;s Aunt Valerie&#8217;s friend Peter&#8217;s car broke down. He would later drive by us on his way home to get it fixed.<br />
Around 12:15, we finally reached the fence surrounding the field. A Buffalo (aircraft, not a mammal) circled above us. As we approached the gate, it dumped three streamers, which fell slowly to the ground. I suspected that it was to test the wind conditions for the Skyhawks. I was right &#8212; little did we know at the time, but Sean and crew were all in the Buffalo, waiting to jump.<br />
Before I progress any further, I should clear something up. Sean is younger than you think he is. He is married to Allison&#8217;s aunt Linda, who is only five years older than Allison &#8212; Sean&#8217;s only about five years older than me. Just in case some of you thought he&#8217;s some old geezer leaping from planes for a kick&#8230;<br />
Finally arriving in the base, we took a few minutes to stroll about. We went past some F-16s, some A-10s (which, last I heard, had been decommissioned), gliders, a C5 Galaxy, a couple of helicopters, and a small city worth of people.<br />
On our way to the field to sit and watch, the show started with one of the Skyhawks floating into the field, carrying an American flag underneath him. (Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s good reason for this &#8212; it was an &#8220;international&#8221; air show, which means the US Air Force had supplied a few planes for show.) He was quickly followed by another Skyhawk carrying a Canadian flag. This was kind of redundant, since all the Skyhawks have Canadian flag parachutes.<br />
Aside: For those of you who watch &#8220;Due South&#8221;, you may remember a series of Mounties who parachuted into the frozen north in the final episode, all with Canadian flag parachutes. I&#8217;ll give you two guesses who did the actual jumps. And no, Sean wasn&#8217;t with them at the time.<br />
No sooner had we taken our position that the next few Skyhawks came down, from a distance of 10,000 feet. The first few came in a stacked tower formation (one on top of the other). Another came down carrying smoke canisters under him. He flew into a spiral (on purpose) to create a &#8220;candy cane&#8221; swirling effect.<br />
Four more skydivers formed a diamond with their parachutes, at which point we heard Sean&#8217;s name come over the PA system. Although we cheered, we didn&#8217;t hear anyone else &#8212; I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d be able to hear the others cheer. As it turns out, finding them wasn&#8217;t a problem. I just followed Sean to where he landed &#8212; the rest of the family was there, waiting.<br />
Most of the family (at least from what I gather) was nervous &#8212; after all, he was jumping out of plane. How many people do that in the right minds? I, however, wasn&#8217;t the least bit worried. Now, this could partly be because I&#8217;d only seen Sean twice, and really don&#8217;t know him that well. However, I also knew that these were consummate professionals, who didn&#8217;t like taking risks. The odds of something going wrong were reasonably slim.<br />
After Sean collected his parachute, he and the rest of the team bounded over the fence (as well as someone carrying 30lbs of parachute can bound) and held an impromptu demonstration of how to pack a parachute back up. It was rather fascinating. We basically ignored the rest of the air show until Sean left, to go see the sponsors.<br />
Sean would return later in the show, taking Allison&#8217;s grandfather to the area reserved for base personnel and their family for a surprise presentation. I tagged along to take pictures.<br />
Sean had the Skyhawks sign a special poster, and place a sticker that said &#8220;Happy 80th Ernest&#8221;. In a quick ceremony, the captain of the team presented the poster to Allison&#8217;s grandfather, who was quite touched by the gesture.<br />
Skyhawks are brutally nice. Of course, they have to be &#8212; their ambassadors for the Canadian Armed Forces. They are effectively in media relations. Sean&#8217;s quite good at it, too. He rather likes it, so he told me. They were so nice as to sign brochures for us. Sean goes down as the first person I&#8217;d ever asked for an autograph.<br />
The Snowbirds were the last event of the show. In typical Snowbird-style, they put on a great show. We didn&#8217;t stay around for the whole event, however, as we had to catch a ferry home. We ducked out while they were still flying about. It almost felt like the Snowbirds were running cover for us as we drove out the exit.<br />
We returned to Nanaimo and prepared to leave for the ferry. We lucked out with another Ferry Classic, which meant we&#8217;d have good seating. Our trip was even complete with celebrities. Rather, celebrity.<br />
As I returned from the galley with empty hands (they had no frozen yoghurt on that trip), I caught the face of an elderly Asian man walking in my direction. It took me only a moment to realise that it was David Suzuki. <em>The</em> David Suzuki. Mr. Nature of Things. Allison was looking at me, her eyes bugged open, nodding vigorously, as if in agreement with the question I was apparently supposed to be asking, namely: &#8220;Is that who I think it is?&#8221;<br />
Upon reaching Horseshoe Bay, we exited the ferry, found the car, and dragged ourselves home.<br />
It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks, and we haven&#8217;t had a chance to slow down. Both Allison and I were exhausted when we got home. Although we had been planning to see the Nanaimo Bathtub Races this weekend, we&#8217;re probably not going to go, opting for some rest.<br />
Besides, it&#8217;s my turn to clean the apartment this weekend&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life&#8217;s a beach.<br />
At least, it should be.<br />
Last weekend was the second busy weekend for Allison and I, the second weekend of the month we weren&#8217;t home. We won&#8217;t be home for a weekend probably until mid-August at the pace things are currently going. Every weekend has something new for us to explore. Frankly, this is a good thing &#8230; provided the weather holds out.<br />
We left on Friday night, meeting at Horseshoe Bay. Knowing that traffic would be a nightmare, Allison left from the apartment early. I left downtown on the 5:07 express to Horseshoe Bay, arriving a mere five minutes before Allison.<br />
We dropped the car off at the Park and Ride, which the local Lion&#8217;s Club. Normally, the lot is free, you just have to walk the kilometre or so to the ferry terminal. When the Lion&#8217;s are about, you have to pay a paltry $5/day (a bargain compared to the other lots), and you get a free ride to the terminal.<br />
We were somewhat excited to find that we would be taking one of the mythical Fast Ferries, the first of which went into service on 1 July. It was supposed to leave at 18:00. We boarded it at 18:07. Needless to say, the Fast Ferry hasn&#8217;t been running exactly up to snuff just yet&#8230;<br />
The Fast Ferry is a catamaran with twin water jet propulsion systems. They run at a supposed 45 knots, making the trip in just under an hour. Supposedly. In actuality, it runs at about 37 knots, and in the long run, might save you about five minutes, all told. Why?<br />
Because we let the government design it, that&#8217;s why.<br />
All fairness aside, they did try. But as Yoda once said: &#8220;Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.&#8221; The design would work well for longer-haul trips. However, the design is not exactly well-suited to the short jaunts across the Strait. You see &#8212; the ship points in only one direction.<br />
Why is that significant? All the other ships point in two directions, allowing them to be driven from either end. No turning, no slowing down to back in; just straight-forward (no pun intended) driving. The Fast Ferry is a uni-directional ship. It has to be turned around before it can go anywhere. It needs a dollar to turn on a dime.<br />
This means that for one leg of the trip, the ship has to turn around at both ends &#8212; otherwise, the cars can&#8217;t get off without backing up themselves. As it stands, it takes too long to empty the ship without people having to drive off in reverse.<br />
And the wake. Homeowners around Bowen Island (which the ferries all pass) have been shocked at the near-tsunami conditions that the ferry generates. It threatens to rip up docks and smash boats against the shore. BC Ferries contends that the wake is minimal.<br />
Minimal, my heiny&#8230;<br />
On the way back, we were on a good ol&#8217; regular ferry. When the Fast Ferry rocketed past us, it sent our ship rocking &#8212; the only time in dozens of crossing that Allison and I have been on where I could actually feel the ship rock due to waves.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me started on the interior &#8220;features&#8221; either. I&#8217;ll just leave my opinion at this: The government would have been far better off spending the money on upgrading our existing ferries and making sure that the less-travelled (but still necessary) routes don&#8217;t suffer due to lack of funds. Heck, you could have built two regular ferries for the price it cost to build one Fast Ferry.<br />
And there are two more coming off the assembly line.<br />
Anyway, we arrived in Nanaimo about one hour and 20 minutes after we left West Vancouver and proceeded to the Collins Family Estate, in the prestigious Divers Lake area. There we were subdued by the plethora of relatives who had descended on the household for the weekend.<br />
It was Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday party. The second one. As you may recall (see [[Snow in Vancouver, Dinner on the Island]]), we had already attended a birthday party at The Grotto in Nanaimo. However, it wasn&#8217;t exactly suitable for a large get-together of friends, so the official party was postponed until the weekend past.<br />
The following morning, we rose and dressed for the occasion. Although not a formal event, we were obviously not going to show up in loud pink shirts and spandex shorts, so we dressed in beige pants and blue shirts.<br />
I&#8217;m not kidding. We really did.<br />
This, of course, was an accident. Neither Allison or I had heard each other the night we packed to leave &#8212; we had inadvertently packed virtually the same outfit. This is not just a fashion faux pas &#8212; it looks really weird. So avoid confusion and embarrassment, I raided Randy&#8217;s closet for a different shirt. It turned out that I grabbed a shirt that Randy had never worn &#8212; it has just been given to him from Mr. Collins. Luckily, though, it fit.<br />
Overall, it was a good party, although Allison and I didn&#8217;t move around too much, we spent most of our time talking to old friends of family (that I didn&#8217;t know), cousins, and Grandma Collins. We didn&#8217;t really know many others.  Late in the afternoon, Grandma Vailmont (the one basically running the whole show) abducted me to play bocci.<br />
Bocci is a bit of a religion there. You can&#8217;t escape it. If you go to a Vailmont family get-together, you&#8217;ll probably end up playing bocci. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t know how &#8212; you&#8217;ll learn. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t like it &#8212; you will. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you have no arms &#8212; someone will throw for you. Resistance is futile.<br />
I ended up on a team with Janet, Mrs. Collins&#8217; cousin, and two of Allison&#8217;s cousins, Kersten (9) and Mitchell (4). Both are young. Like most siblings, they fight a fair bit.<br />
I will wholeheartedly admit that I forgot was sibling rivalry was like &#8212; it had been a very long time since my sister and I had a good screaming match. (We now sit around the kitchen table, drink beer, and discuss finances. My how the times change.)<br />
It was exceptionally difficult to play a close game. If one side got too far ahead, one of the two siblings would be upset. Janet and I got very good at placing balls close to the marker ball, and far away from the marker ball. We adjusted our strategies depending on the accuracy of the younger two&#8217;s throws. In the end, Mitchell (the younger of the two) won by a mere point. Kersten, despite losing, was not upset.<br />
When the party finally ended, it took those of us remaining only a short period of time to clean everything up. As we retreated to the Collins Family Estate, Vicki (one of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters) announced a barbeque at Rathtrevor Beach the following day.<br />
Rathtrevor Beach is the Bay of Fundy of the west coast &#8230; only horizontal. Whereas the Bay of Fundy has very high tides, Rathtrevor Beach has very long tides. If you arrive at the beach at low tide, you&#8217;ll find yourself walking well over a kilometre to find water &#8230; even further to find water deep enough to come up to your neck (assuming you stand 5&#8242; 11 7/8&#8243;).<br />
At any rate, the beach is huge. Gigantic. Enormous. And despite the number of people who show up, virtually empty. This leads to things such as sandcastles, kite-flying, and lots of people walking aimlessly. In short, typical beach-going behaviour.<br />
Upon arriving at the beach, we had to take Kersten and Mitchell out onto the beach &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t wait. Mind you, neither could I. The last time I was on an ocean beach (or a saltwater beach, depending on how you look at it) for the purposes of sitting in the sun and doing beach-related things was in 1991. (Yes, I know I went to the beach in Monterey last year, but it was way too cold to even consider swimming.) It had been a long time since I had walked across a good beach.<br />
And boy, do you every have a long walk. Because the beach is so expansive, it also has a lot of interesting features, most notably tidal pools. Although devoid of fish, the pools have lots of shellfish, crabs, and snails. You can imagine the kids&#8217; reaction to those. Most revolved around &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;ewwww!&#8221;. Allison, Robin (another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters), and Wilma (yet another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters, who lives in Germany) gave out marine biology lessons to those of us not quite up-to-snuff with the proper information. While I&#8217;m at, I&#8217;ll mention Mrs. Collins&#8217; last unmentioned sibling, Laura &#8212; Kersten and Mitchell are her children.<br />
What do you associate sand dollars with? Tropical waters, right? Take a wild guess what thrives all over Rathtrevor Beach? Yep &#8230; thousands of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re everywhere. You can&#8217;t take any of them with you &#8212; that&#8217;s a no-no. But you can pick them up and see what they look like while they&#8217;re still alive. Black ones are living &#8230; the whitish ones have since deceased.<br />
Finally reaching the ocean, we waded in a little ways and splashed around a bit. Baby flatfish (halibut or flounders, probably) skitted about our feet, trying to get away from the two-footed giants traipsing through the middle of their sanctuary.<br />
A few minutes later, we realised that the water was about to soak all the things we&#8217;d left on shore to stay dry. The tide was turning, and beginning to reclaim the shore. It was time to go back for lunch.<br />
After partaking in much the same food as we&#8217;d had the day before, several of us ventured back out onto the beach to build a sandcastle. Initially just Brenna, Kersten, and Mitchell, I soon followed, with several others not far behind. The construction was hasty, mostly because the tide was coming in fairly quickly.<br />
As Brenna build the castle with Kersten and Mitchell, I quickly built an outer wall, designed to keep the water away for a short period of time. The wall wouldn&#8217;t hold the water out indefinitely, but it would at least make for a more interesting destruction of the castle.<br />
Sure enough, the water soon arrived, so Kersten and Mitchell took refuge in their sandy kingdom &#8230; for a few precious minutes. Eventually, the tide ate away at the walls, no thanks to the surrounding adults who were surreptitiously splashing the walls, hastening their demise. The flood inside the walls soon took down the castle&#8217;s structure, ending the brief reign of King Mitchell and Queen Kersten.<br />
Following a short swim in the now-flooded beach, we packed up and headed home. Although we could have made the 19:00 ferry to Vancouver, Allison and I waited until the 21:00. In retrospect, this was a good idea &#8230; we would have travelled on a Fast Ferry, and we all know what I think of them.</p>

		<p>Deciding that the weather here had become too unbearable to stand for another weekend, let alone a long weekend, Allison and I opted to abdicate the Lower Mainland for places sunnier.<br />
At least, that was the plan.<br />
I booked Friday off (don&#8217;t you just hate it when the holiday lands on anything but Friday or Monday?), we packed a few things into a cooler (namely the two tonnes of fruit we received in our organic vegetable delivery &#8212; yes, I know I&#8217;m turning into a hippie), and started driving towards the Okanagan.<br />
Within a couple of hours, we noticed that the rain was beginning to slowly subside. At first, we managed to elude Mother Nature. Every time I said &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s some blue sky!&#8221;, she figured out where we had disappeared to, and covered over all vestiges of the sun.<br />
Arriving in Merritt shortly after noon, we stopped for lunch and a rest break. Having been chastised for jinxing the weather earlier in the trip, I had not said one word about the conditions. As a result, Mother Nature lost track of us again, and the weather was warm and bright. A bit windy too, so we ate lunch in the car for fear of blowing away with the tumbleweeds.<br />
Leaving the Coquihalla highway behind us, we headed towards the Okanagan Valley. This trip, roughly an hour from Merritt, is plagued with many dangers: Severe Winter Weather, tight corners, and many examples of &#8220;driverius moronicus&#8221;. One particular specimen opted to pass three cars (of which I was the lead) right in front of on-coming traffic. The on-coming traffic had to bolt over to the shoulder to prevent a head-on collision. If I had not noticed this happening, we could probably have been in an accident. Had I been a bit quicker, I would have gladly jotted down the turkey&#8217;s license and turned him into the RCMP&#8230;<br />
Arriving alive and unscathed in Kelowna around 1:30pm, we headed in the direction of my relative&#8217;s home. While in Kelowna, we were staying at the luxurious Chateau Tisdale, situated near the shores of Lake Okanagan. Thinking that both my aunt and uncle were working, I thought it best that we show up a bit later.<br />
This gave us the opportunity to sight see a little.<br />
Our first stop was the Kettle Valley planned community. This is a development that some genius thought up a few years ago. On a rather large chunk of land just south of Kelowna, developers are building a very large community, complete with town centre, schools, and character homes. In fact, the entire development is full of character &#8212; Victorian-style homes currently dot the area.<br />
The development is far from complete. It will probably take 20 years or more to finish the development. But it will be very nice when it&#8217;s full of families.<br />
We stopped into the office and one of the show homes to see what it was like. In addition to being considerably cheaper than homes in the Lower Mainland, the homes were high quality, and very nice. We were a bit surprised that none of the salespeople gave us the hard sell. We weren&#8217;t sure if it was because that was their style, or if it was because we looked too young. (We always get the hard sell out here.)<br />
From the Kettle Valley development, we headed back towards my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home. Along the way, we opted to stop into the Summerhill Winery. (So we found out, it&#8217;s a law that all tourists have to stop into at least one winery while in the Okanagan. We had somehow managed to avoid it the first couple of times, but didn&#8217;t want to run the risk of a large fine for breaking the law this time.)<br />
As we rounded the corner, we saw the winery&#8217;s piece de resistance &#8230; a large white pyramid. I&#8217;ll get back to that in a moment or two&#8230;<br />
We pulled into the parking lot, and quickly found two things: 1) There was a free &#8220;sparking wine&#8221; tour, and 2) We missed lunch by about 10 minutes. We stuck around for the 3:00pm tour.<br />
Our tour guide, so we figured, was a ski hill enthusiast working for the summer. (Another weird BC law states that the wineries, in return for getting mandatory visits by all the tourists, also has to hire all the ski bums who can&#8217;t ski during the summer.) She was a good speaker, I will admit, although she did exhibit a bit of attitude.<br />
She took us around the winery, showing us the grapes Summerhill grows, the machines used to press the grapes &#8230; I&#8217;m going to pause here a moment. Interesting things to know about pressing grapes:<br />
Summerhill presses their grapes to roughly 65% of their volume (this is called the &#8220;first pressing&#8221;), then mulches the left overs (including the stems and leaves of the grapes), and puts it back out in the field as fertilizer. Other wineries go to a second pressing, and even a third pressing. The guide expressed her disdain for additional pressings, saying that other wineries weren&#8217;t concerned about quality if they went to these additional pressings. Although she wouldn&#8217;t name names, she did say that the third pressing was usually referred to as the &#8220;rotting grape&#8221;. &#8216;Nuff said.<br />
(Additional note, which I&#8217;ll add before Allison does: Fourth pressings usually become grape juice, and the leftovers are turned into fruit leather. Summerhill, obviously, does not do this.)<br />
Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, we saw the machines used to press the grapes, and then we went into the winery building to see where all the magic takes place. Sparking wine (technically, it *is* champagne, but because &#8220;champagne&#8221; is trademarked for wineries in the Champagne region of France, no-one outside that area can use the term &#8220;champagne&#8221;; look for &#8220;methode classique&#8221; instead) is a work-intensive beverage.<br />
After the wine is left in vats to ferment for a while, it is bottled and capped with bottle caps. They are then shelved for three years while the yeast eats up every scrap of sugar in the wine. (This is why champagne is so dry.) Then they have to &#8220;riddle&#8221; the bottles, which is the laborious part.<br />
First, the bottles are whacked against a rubber tire to loosen up all the yeast (which is now caked to one side of the bottle). All 10,000 bottles of a batch are placed in special riddling racks, which starts the bottle out roughly horizontal. Each day, the riddler comes along, gives each bottle a quarter-turn, moving the bottle a little more vertical. (A riddler can riddle 10,000 bottles in 55 minutes.) By the end of the process, the yeast has collected in the neck of the bottle.<br />
Then the bottles are put into a glycol solution (only the first inch or so of the neck) to freeze the contents, including the leftover yeast. Then comes the fun part &#8212; removing the bottle cap. The caps keep the contents of the bottle under the pressure generated by the yeast&#8217;s by product: Carbon dioxide gas. 125 pounds per square inch of it.<br />
Needless to say, it&#8217;s a very messy process.<br />
The bottles are then topped up with a &#8220;dosange&#8221;, which guarantees 750ml of sparking wine, a little bit of sweet wine and a touch of yeast, and then the hasty corking (with a hefty cork, I might add).<br />
Definitely not a home-brew kind of project.<br />
Following bottling portion came the warehouse &#8230; the pyramid (told you I was getting back to this). It seems that the guy who set up the winery is a huge believer in the power of pyramids. (What can I say, other than the west coast attracts the weirdos.)<br />
There&#8217;s a theory that says a properly-designed pyramid will even out of the flow of tachyons (particles that move faster than the speed of light) and tardyons (particles that move slightly slower than the speed of light). Supposedly this is what causes the power of the pyramid. Instead of going sour, milk turns into yogurt; dull razors sharpen; meat petrifies rather than rots. Our guide suggested that was the reason why all the mummies in Egypt were petrified. I was about to suggest that it was because the bodies were drained of all decay-causing fluids, and then sat in natron (salt) for 40 days to dry it out &#8212; not to mention that most mummies were never in pyramids. But I kept quiet (yeah, I know, it&#8217;s a rarity).<br />
Supposedly, this makes the wine taste better. The winery had held taste tests a couple of years earlier, testing out the theory. Everyone who tasted a wine aged in a pyramid and the same wine aged normally chose the pyramid wine. Can&#8217;t tell you if it was fixed, but that&#8217;s what we were told.<br />
Then came the best part &#8230; the tasting. We were instructed how to taste wines (something which I had only partly known). If it&#8217;s a sparking wine, the first thing you do is look at the bubbles. They should be very small and fast-moving. This is the sign of a good sparking wine (or champagne). If the bubbles are large and lethargic, then you have something called &#8220;Baby Duck&#8221;. Yeah, it&#8217;s fake. If you don&#8217;t have a sparking wine, go to Step 2&#8230;<br />
Look at the clarity of the wine &#8212; it shouldn&#8217;t be cloudy. If it is, put the wine back in the bottle, take it back to the store, and have it replaced. You don&#8217;t want to be sucking back any yeast (that&#8217;s the cloudy stuff). It&#8217;s not lethal, but you&#8217;ll be wishing it was.<br />
Swirl the wine. Look at the film left on the glass. It should split into rivulets as it drains back into the wine. These are called &#8220;legs&#8221;. The thicker and slower the legs, the sweeter the wine. It&#8217;s not a precise measurement, but it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
Look into the glass, where the wine meets the glass itself. This thin barrier is called the &#8220;meniscus&#8221; (something I remember from Grade 7 science). If it&#8217;s a greenish colour (in white wine) or a brownish colour (in red wine), then the wine&#8217;s oxidized. That&#8217;s what you get for not drinking the whole bottle in one shot.<br />
Next you smell. I don&#8217;t know why, you just do. Assumedly, you&#8217;ll know if it smells bad.<br />
Finally, you get to taste it. But not really. Your first sip is rolled around in the mouth, covered all points and corners. You don&#8217;t pay attention to the taste, mostly because you have to orient your mouth to the new flavours of the wine. When you take your next sip, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what the wine actually tastes like. You aerate the wine by (quietly) slurping it. I don&#8217;t know what this does exactly, but listening to 20 retired tourists do this is kinda funny.<br />
After you&#8217;ve done all this, you can finally drink the silly thing. You have to go through this process each time you switch wines, or you won&#8217;t get the full effect.<br />
Of course, that&#8217;s assuming you give a flying fig about all that&#8230;<br />
After the sparking wine (which was quite tasty, I will say), we tried two red and two white wines. Our favourite was the GewÃ«rztraminer. It&#8217;s a sweeter wine, and goes very well with spicy foods. Allison and I also tried their icewine after I made an inquiry as to whether they had any.<br />
Most people drink wines that vary from 0 to 2 in sweetness. Most people I know won&#8217;t drink anything above a 5 &#8212; it&#8217;s too sweet. The Summerhill Riesling Icewine is an 18. None of the wine-tasting techniques work on icewine, incidentally. And if you drink icewine, don&#8217;t try to drink anything else for about 30 minutes &#8212; you won&#8217;t taste a thing.<br />
Luckily, we weren&#8217;t close to being inebriated, so we could leave shortly thereafter. We arrived at the Tisdale&#8217;s around 4:30, and were promptly hugged to death by my aunt (she wasn&#8217;t working that day, as I had thought she might). No sooner than we were sitting in the kitchen did my uncle show up, claiming that their computers had crashed again, and he didn&#8217;t see the need to stick around any longer.<br />
We talked for a couple of hours before setting into dinner mode. The barbequing duties fell on myself, which meant I had to try and not burn the steaks. I got lucky, although they were a bit too much on the well done side. (Thick steaks on an unfamiliar barbeque make for difficult work.)<br />
After dinner, we headed out for the fireworks. This entailed driving down to Kelowna&#8217;s downtown, finding a place to park, and then walking to the appropriate viewing place.<br />
So we walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
Did I mention we walked a lot?<br />
We walked.<br />
Finally, we stopped not far from the north end of town (or so it seemed), just as the fireworks got underway. Not the most spectacular show I&#8217;d seen, but it was far better than the slop Vancouver had put on the year before. It was no Symphony of Fire, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad.<br />
Following the show, we fought through the 50,000 or so people who turned out to get back to the car, and back home. We passed out within moments of hitting the pillows.<br />
We woke up the next morning to the sound of &#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; being bellowed by my uncle. We crawled out of bed and worked our way into the kitchen, to a meal of fried eggs, oranges, toast, superbly-cooked bacon, and cherries. It was a great way to start the day &#8230; especially since Mother Nature had found us again, and clouded everything over.<br />
Before I knew it, my uncle was gone. It wasn&#8217;t long before it was our turn. We bade my aunt good-bye, and then hit the road.<br />
The trip to Penticton is only about 45 minutes, and is a nice drive. Upon arriving, we hunted down our motel &#8212; the Majestic Motor Inn. Yes, the name is cheesy. So&#8217;s the interior of the room. The building was put up in the early 60&#8217;s (by my estimate). The interior hasn&#8217;t changed since then. It was almost fun (except our next door neighbour was a bit freaky).<br />
One of the reasons we were going to Penticton was to meet up with our friends, Lisa and Miran. (Lisa one of Allison&#8217;s best friends; Lisa and Miran being an item; I know Miran from university, since before I met Allison. [Insert clip of &#8220;It&#8217;s a Small World, After All&#8221; here.]) Finding their room, we found that they were nowhere to be found. So off we went.<br />
Lunch was of the order, as it had been a few hours since breakfast. We stopped at a place called &#8220;Joe&#8217;s on the Beach&#8221;, which specialised in New Orleans-style cuisine (at least, as much as the fare of a beach-front greasy spoon could be called &#8220;cuisine&#8221;). For $15, we were certainly not in the complaining mood &#8212; the meal was tasty, although large.<br />
Returning to the outside, we couldn&#8217;t help but notice one thing: Penticton was dead. Here it was, the Canada Day weekend, and the vacation town of the Okanagan was deserted. There didn&#8217;t seem to be any real reason for it.<br />
We walked down the length of Lakeshore Drive, almost to the Peach (a refreshment stand on the waterfront). Deciding we needed some refreshement, not to mention some money, we headed down Winnipeg St. towards the downtown. In a few moments, we hit upon a 7-11.<br />
It had been a really long time since I sat in front of a convenience store, eating a creamsicle and drinking a slurpee. It was kind of like being a kid again. It felt good. It felt free. It felt really really cold when I drank the slurpee too fast and followed up with a large bit of the creamsicle. Lousy brain freeze.<br />
On the way back, we stopped into the Visitor and Wine Information Centre (Penticton is roughly in the middle of the entire wine-making area, so gets the coveted Info Centre as a result). We looked around, picked up a few brochures, and then headed back to the motel.<br />
We got together with Lisa and Miran that night, under the guise of going to a barbeque at the Lake Breeze Winery, in beautiful downtown Naramata. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Naramata is some dinky little place on the eastern side of Lake Okanagan. I don&#8217;t think it has anything but vineyards and orchards, let alone a downtown.)<br />
After zigging and zagging around the countryside a little, we came to the Lake Breeze Winery, only to find that the supposed barbeque wasn&#8217;t on. No explanation, no nothing. I got the feeling that we were the only ones who didn&#8217;t know.<br />
We stopped briefly at a lookout hill on the way back, which turned out to be the mountain that bears the large &#8220;Penticton&#8221; sign, visible from Highway 97 on the opposite side of the lake.<br />
We had dinner that night at Salty&#8217;s Beachside. It tries to take its ambience from the Caribbean. I stress &#8220;tries&#8221;. The food was decent, although nothing really to write home about (which is why I&#8217;m not really mentioning anything other that we ate there).<br />
Following dinner, we retreated to Lisa and Miran&#8217;s motel room to share a bottle of wine. I believe it was a Cabernet Sauvignon from Sumac Ridge, but I could be wrong. Either way, the wine and a discussion of the pyramid at Summerhill led us to one of the weirdest conversations I&#8217;ve ever had.<br />
Miran and I attempted (and mostly failed) to properly explain Einstein&#8217;s Special Theory of Relativity. For about two hours, we tried to explain properly why for a stationary observer, time seems to slow down for someone moving close to the speed of light. (It stands to reason that the person travelling at the speed of light will, in comparison to the stationary person, age less.)<br />
Finally giving up trying to explain it fully, Allison and I went home to sleep.<br />
The next morning, we rose slowly to weather that could be best described as &#8220;spotty&#8221;. Lisa and Miran were off to Oliver to find more wineries, so Allison and I opted to check out Sumac Ridge. The primary reason was because we liked the sound of the lunch we could get at their Cellar Door bistro.<br />
And believe me &#8212; that lunch is something to write home about. Pecan and cornmeal encrusted chicken breast with apricot chutney, served with fresh baby greens with a red wine vinaigrette. Based on a suggestion, we had a glass of 97 Gewurtztraminer. The meal was preceeded by a basket of fresh breads which were absolutely scrumptious. (There&#8217;s a word I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d use.)<br />
Unfortunately, the wine had one minor problem &#8230; we were in no condition to drive anywhere. So we hopped onto the winery tour to work off the alcohol. We found that Sumac Ridge was one of the wineries Summerhill frowns upon &#8212; they do multiple pressings. (If you purchase Sumac Ridge, aim for bottles marked with &#8220;Special Reserve&#8221; &#8212; this is the batch from the first pressing.)<br />
Then it was through the coldest room I&#8217;ve ever been in. Allison and I nearly froze while our guide (another skiing enthusiast) explained why the wines were chilled to near freezing. They were settling out the yeast and a susbstance that sometimes is used in making tartar sauce. The weird things you learn at a winery&#8230;<br />
We purchased two bottles of the Gewurtztraminer (as you might expect, we really liked it) and two small bottles of icewine (at 50ml apiece, there wasn&#8217;t much) &#8212; one was for Lisa and Miran.<br />
We stopped through Summerhill on the way back, eventually buying a small bag of chocolate-covered dried cherries. Very tasty.<br />
We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing. This was, of course, a vacation &#8212; there was no need to work ourselves silly by trying to be too many places at once.<br />
Lisa called us at 6:30 to see if we were ready to go out. The first order of business was the mini-golf. Despite the fact that I quadruple-bogied a few holes, I still managed to beat the others &#8230; by a single stroke. In fact, there was a spread of only four strokes between all of us. (In short, we were all roughly the same calibre when it came to golf &#8230; although one of us was more apt to flinging balls into bushes.)<br />
Dinner was the hard part. We strolled right down the main strip without finding anything decent. We kept walking right until we were at the other end, checked out the Pentiction Resort, and finally settled on Mambo&#8217;s, the Italian eatery overlooking the lake.<br />
Dinner was supplemented by a large pitcher of sangria, but was (so I&#8217;m told) bland overall. My risoto wasn&#8217;t too bad, but the others&#8217; meals weren&#8217;t great. Dessert more than made up for it. While Lisa and Miran shared a tiramisu, Allison and I shared a meringue and vanilla ice cream platter with (real) whip cream and strawberries. Very tasty.<br />
We opted to skip the Relativity discussion that night, and made directly for bed. Getting home, I suddenly realised that Allison&#8217;s sunglass case was missing the sunglasses. Somehow, since the time Allison had given me her sunglasses (magnetic clip-ons for her regular glasses) at the mini-golf, I had managed to lose them.<br />
As you can imagine, I felt a bit like a heel that night&#8230;<br />
Mother Nature was annoyed &#8212; because we&#8217;d been moving around so much, she hadn&#8217;t been able to put clouds over us properly. She figured she&#8217;s do the job right on Sunday, though &#8212; she blanketed the entire province with clouds. And so our trip home would be a dark one.<br />
After quick checks of the mini-golf, Mambo&#8217;s, Penticon Resort, and all points in between for the missing sunglasses, I resolved to be less the cost of the replacements, and we headed towards home.<br />
Instead of the usual Coquihalla route, we tried taking Highway 3 (aka the Crow Foot trail, or some such name). After going up and down about a hundred times over the next few hours, we decided that all trips to the Okanagan would take place via the Coquihalla.<br />
Depression set back in once we reached Hope. The clouds were dark and oppressive, and the landscape looked its usual bleak green. After fighting our way through Lower Mainland morons, we pulled into home and rested from our weary trip.<br />
Ironically enough, today is full of the S-word I dare not speak, for fear of jinxing it again. With luck, it&#8217;ll hang on for a while longer&#8230;</p>

		<p>10 years.<br />
[[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Leaving Canada|I can&#8217;t believe it has been 10 years.]]<br />
On 30 June 1989, I departed for the first of what would become a string of interesting journeys into the unknown. This was my first trip out of North America, and my first trip as an Observer.<br />
I can&#8217;t help but be somewhat reflective upon the arrival of this date. 10 years, no matter who you are, is a long period of time. A lot of things can happen in 10 years &#8230; certainly that is true for me.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I&#8217;m not about to bombard you with a list of the things that have happened to me &#8212; that would be grounds for Amnesty International to boycott me for human rights violations.<br />
10 years ago, I left Canada as a naive teenager, ready to take on the world without fear, not really knowing what the outside world was like. I learned a few things on that trip, but what surprised me most were the things I learned about myself. 10 years later, I&#8217;m still surprising myself, each and every day.<br />
I suppose when I stop being surprised, I&#8217;ll stop living&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen many changes in myself, even over the past five years. Most of my friends and family have seen these changes. If you don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t changed, just remember what I was like when:<br />
a) I was in high school.<br />
b) You first met me.<br />
(For those of you who have met me within the past two years, you might not have really noticed much. So take my word for it. I&#8217;m certain those who have known me a while will back me up.)<br />
The next obvious question is: What&#8217;s in store for the next 10 years? Who knows&#8230; it could be anything. Always in motion, is the future. It&#8217;s hard to see, tough to grasp, nearly impossible to predict. That&#8217;s what I find interesting about it &#8212; the inability to classify it properly. It scares some people, frustrates others. For me, it&#8217;s another challenge to overcome.<br />
Today, the Observer is 10 years old, and is ready to enter his decade of development. With luck, the Observer will keep me young when I start getting old (particularly important, since my birthday comes up in a couple of weeks).<br />
Tomorrow, Allison and I are off to scare the inhabitants of the Okanagan. You&#8217;ll hear about it on Monday.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate monopolies. They generally treat the customer like so much belly button lint.<br />
Late last month, Allison and I decided to get Roger&#8217;s @ Home (aka &#8220;Wave&#8221;). For those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of it, better crawl out from under the bed &#8212; you&#8217;ve been down there too long. It&#8217;s Internet access through your television cable. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s always on, and it&#8217;s twice the price of dial-up.<br />
The reason we wanted to get the Wave was because Allison had decided to go freelance, and needed a way to do research, but not tie up the phone line with the access. Having the ability to download anything at any time was also a major benefit.<br />
Roger&#8217;s had a deal on where you could get your installation free if you called by May 31st. Allison called on that day (she was purchasing it, under the guise of expensing it later) and arranged for installation on June 14th at 11:00am. Fine. No problem.<br />
We&#8217;ll skip ahead a couple of weeks, mostly because there&#8217;s not really much else to fill the gap (and it would make this message really long).<br />
Roger&#8217;s calls me on my cell phone. (We have the cell phone number listed on our voice mail message at home, so it&#8217;s always fairly easy to contact us.) They wanted to change the install time from 11:00am to 9:00am. Although Allison would be at home for the technicians to show up, I figured it would be two hours she wouldn&#8217;t have to waste waiting.<br />
If we only knew&#8230;<br />
Monday morning. I&#8217;m running a tad late. Just as I head out the door, the phone rings. It&#8217;s the technician. He&#8217;s running a little late, but will arrive in 15 minutes. No problem &#8212; it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
At this point, I defer to Allison&#8217;s narrative on the events. (If I make a mistake, a correction will follow shortly.)<br />
At roughly 9:05, Allison receives a phone call from some guy confirming a Wave installation for 11:30. Allison is understandably confused &#8212; it was supposed to be five minutes ago, not 11:30 &#8230; even then, it was originally 11:00. The technician gave her the brush off, saying he couldn&#8217;t make it before 11:30. Allison made him promise, hope to die, poke a needle in his eye that he&#8217;d be there for 11:30. He said: No problem.<br />
At 9:15, a guy shows up at the apartment door (note: he did not buzz into the building), and asked for &#8220;Allison&#8221; <!--(note: not "ann-DRAY-ah", but "ANN-dree-ah")-->. He didn&#8217;t identify himself for some time. Finally, Allison took the risk, opened the door, and only then did the twit say he was there to install the Wave.<br />
I&#8217;m telling you: Belly button lint.<br />
He pulls out a box containing the cable modem (pulls the Internet signals from the TV signals), a cable splitter, and about 90 feet of cable (the cable outlet is on the opposite side of the living room). He plugs in the cable splitter, runs the cable, plugs in the modem, waits for some lights to blink, and leaves.<br />
15 minutes work.<br />
I&#8217;m in the wrong job&#8230;<br />
So you&#8217;re probably wondering at this point &#8212; what the heck was he there for, anyway? Well, Roger&#8217;s has this really inane system of installation: They send a cable technician to install the cable, and get it ready for the PC technician, who comes later.<br />
That&#8217;s who Allison now had to wait for. This shining example of the human race called at 11:26 (just four minutes before he was to appear) to inform Allison that he wasn&#8217;t going to make it. Needless to say, she was turning an interesting shade of very-pissed-off.<br />
This guy made no apologies about not showing up, about the fact that he had sworn up and down that he&#8217;d be there for 11:30, and that Allison had just wasted two hours of her time. He suggested that *we* reschedule.<br />
Um, no.<br />
After firing off a message to Roger&#8217;s (which was half-written shortly after the cable technician left), Allison went to work. We figured that we&#8217;d actually hear from Roger&#8217;s in a short period of time.<br />
Yeah, I know, we&#8217;re living in the wrong universe.<br />
By Wednesday, we still hadn&#8217;t heard from them. By this time, my resolve was fading, and I was ready to bust a few heads. I called up their customer service department, and calmly explained that their idea of customer service was something akin to going to a restaurant and having to catch, clean, and cook your Catch-of-the-Day.<br />
I was told that I would be called back in &#8220;about 30 minutes&#8221;.<br />
The following morning, I made it painfully clear to Roger&#8217;s that I was not pleased. I was ready to cancel my cable outright. The poor guy who took my call was *very* apologetic, and then put me on hold for 45 minutes.<br />
[Ed. Note: Now that it&#8217;s a week later, this fiasco is getting kinda funny.]<br />
Here&#8217;s where it gets really stupid. I end up talking to the twit I&#8217;d talked to the day before. I choose not to mention that he&#8217;d told me that &#8220;at the very least&#8221;, he was supposed to call me back in &#8220;about 30 minutes&#8221;. Instead, he asks me if I&#8217;m at home. I say &#8220;no&#8221;, I&#8217;m at work. He asks me when I&#8217;ll be at home. I say &#8220;when I&#8217;m done, usually around 5:30-6:00pm PDT&#8221;. He says &#8220;Oh&#8221;.<br />
Oh. As in, &#8220;Oh boy, this guy&#8217;s about to kill me when I tell him we have to reschedule some time next century.&#8221;<br />
Luckily, Allison (who had only just started freelancing) *was* at home. I made mention of it. I was told that &#8220;she would be contacted today&#8221;. I quickly called Allison to confirm with her. She said it was &#8220;okay&#8221;. (Sorry, I&#8217;m getting a little &#8220;quote-happy&#8221;.) This was around 1:00pm or so. No-one called Allison until 5:30 or so.<br />
Yeah, really snappy service.<br />
At any rate, I come waltzing in around 6:30pm, with the PC tech practically on my heels. He then spends the next hour and a half tearing his fingers open on our computer (I&#8217;ve lost many a limb in that monstrosity). Several bandages and some swearing later, he&#8217;s got the thing responding to the modem, and we can surf the &#8216;net a lot faster than before.<br />
As we talked with the technician, he explained that Roger&#8217;s had literally just dumped SHL Systemhouse as their PC technicians, and picked up Microage. The transition hadn&#8217;t been really smooth. On Monday alone, they were to do 120 installs. There were only 19 successful ones.<br />
Guess who wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
In the end, things worked out *reasonably* well. We got the installation for free (a smart move on their part), and we got three free months of use (although that was part of the deal from the beginning anyway &#8212; either free installation or free usage). Aside from all the run-around, everything seems to be okay.<br />
At least for now&#8230; [Insert ominous-sounding music here.]</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Monday and Tuesday, I experienced my first real business trip. I probably would be more excited about it than I should be, but we went to Seattle. Whoopee.<br />
Going to Seattle for a business trip is like &#8230; well, imagine you could travel from Ottawa to Toronto in three hours on a six lane Interstate highway. (I would compare it to travelling from Toronto to Hamilton, but that&#8217;s not fair to Hamilton.)<br />
It didn&#8217;t get off to a great start, either. I had to go into the office on Sunday night to finish some work. Allison and I went to the Island Friday night to visit with her family (we hadn&#8217;t been over in a couple of months), so I had to leave work unfinished. This was work that I had to take with me to Seattle. It was kind of necessary that I get it done.<br />
We were attending Microsoft Meltdown, which is (for all intents and purposes) Microsoft&#8217;s support of the video game industry. Sure, there are companies there that have nothing to do with the industry, but they are few in number.<br />
What we did there was take two of the games we&#8217;re developing (our hockey and basketball games) and test them out on several video card manufacturer&#8217;s computers. It&#8217;s a good way of making sure that our games work properly on different computers, and the video card manufacturers can see what problems their games may have.<br />
Radical Entertainment has a tradition of always leaving a copy of our games with the manufacturers so they can continue testing at their leisure. That&#8217;s what I was doing Sunday night &#8212; making copies of the games. Sadly, my good friend Murphy decided to drop by that night, so a one hour job soon turned into a five-hour nightmare.<br />
(Just for reference, everything worked just fine, so it was worth the agony.)<br />
I got up a little too late Monday morning (hey, I&#8217;d only been asleep for about three and a half hours &#8212; I was tired), and was about two minutes late getting downstairs where Neall (one of my co-workers, and our driver to the conference) was waiting.<br />
We picked up Nigel (another co-worker) and Tim (my boss) at Radical, which was a relatively central pick-up location. We then pointed the car south, and headed towards the home of the Space Needle.<br />
Nigel opted to provide the music on our little trip. (Not that we really ever had time to pay attention to it &#8212; we spent almost the entire time talking. Natch &#8212; *they* spent almost the entire time talking &#8230; about cars. I know little by comparison, so opted to listen and be bored for most of the trip.) Referring to Nigel as a &#8220;Star Wars Fan&#8221; is like saying the Universe is big; he brought along the soundtracks to &#8220;A New Hope&#8221; (the real name for the original &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; movie), &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, &#8220;Return of the Jedi&#8221;, and &#8220;The Phantom Menace&#8221;. Not exactly what I&#8217;d consider road trip music.<br />
Seattle has bad traffic. KOMO 4 News even had a quasi-documentary on it a few months ago. On Monday morning, we figured out what the problem is: No-one wants to carpool.<br />
The I-5 north of Seattle has a carpool lane. Runs right to downtown (it turns into an express lane that literally fires you right through the middle of downtown). It was virtually empty. While the rest of the traffic came to virtual standstills, we were whipping along at 60mph without any worries at all.<br />
We quickly checked into the Sheraton Seattle and hauled our bags to our rooms. I bunked with Nigel, while Neall and Tim shared a room down the hall. My roll was &#8220;Swag Sherpa&#8221; (more on that in a moment), so I got to carry the bag full of CDs and other junk we would use throughout the course of the day.<br />
We signed ourselves into the conference, and took a chance to use our first three testing slots (we had to sign up to test our games, which is usually an ordeal &#8212; getting a chance to sign up early was a bug advantage). We had to wait until 10am to get the rest of the testing slots, so we opted to have breakfast instead.<br />
By the time we finished, the testing slots were open to a free-for-all. Luckily, the general population was still embedded inside the main conference hall, listening to a bunch of people listening to themselves talk. (Yeah, that&#8217;s about how interesting the seminars are.) We took the time to get the rest of our slots for Monday. (Tuesday&#8217;s slots wouldn&#8217;t open until lunch.)<br />
Unfortunately, none of the testing sessions started until after lunch. This meant we still had three hours to kill. So we did the only thing we could &#8230; we tortured ourselves with the seminars.<br />
So, imagine that you&#8217;re in a large room with about 400 people. The people giving the talks are boring, repetitive, and really not worth listening to. Imagine that you&#8217;ve had only three hours of sleep. Suddenly, passing out face first onto your conference notes doesn&#8217;t seem like such a bad idea.<br />
If only I had done that.<br />
Luckily, Neall, Nigel, and Tim decided that the speeches weren&#8217;t worth the air they were being broadcasted through, and we left.<br />
Lunch came not too long later. A fancy chicken breast sandwich with a small cheesecake for dessert. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder &#8212; most of the people here are techies, why on Earth would any of them really be interested in this kind of food. Where were the burgers? Where were the fries? At least they had a healthy stock of Coca-Cola and other similar beverages &#8212; it would have been a travesty, otherwise.<br />
Testing began at 1:30. This amounted to us going from room to room in the hotel, installing our games on vendor&#8217;s computers, testing them out, collecting t-shirts and other various things used to persuade us to develop on specific boards, uninstall the games, and proceed to the next room. All that ended at just after 5pm.<br />
Tim decided he would disappear to visit with family (his brother works for Boeing), while Neall, Nigel, and I opted to go see Star Wars (again).<br />
Before we headed out, I convinced them to go downstairs to the Product Showcase to see what was there. It&#8217;s a good thing, too &#8212; we saw a product we had never seen before, and wowed the three of us. 3D glasses.<br />
Yeah, okay, maybe 3D glasses ain&#8217;t exactly the bee&#8217;s knees, but when you consider that these glasses required no specific hardware, worked (theoretically) on any computer, and required no special programming in a game, we were suitably impressed. Not to mention playing &#8220;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&#8221; in 3D was pretty slick. We would make a point of stopping by that company the following day.<br />
Dinner was programmer food: Hamburgers, Pogos, onion rings, pretzels, and pop. Basic junk. (It&#8217;s what gets a video game programmer through the day.) Then it was off to the movie theatre around the block.<br />
Star Wars wasn&#8217;t playing. (As it turned out, the theatres were *really* small, and the sound was pretty lousy.) However, &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; was. Neither Neall or Nigel had seen the movie, and while I had seen it twice, I didn&#8217;t mind seeing it again. Besides, I had nothing else better to do at the time.<br />
As we still had 40 minutes before the movie started, we hopped over to FAO Schwartz to check out their collection of Star Wars toys. (Still no luck in finding a Darth Maul action figure.)<br />
I will admit, I fully expected Neall and Nigel to not like &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. They hate everything. It&#8217;s their lot in life. They are, by far, the most cynical people I have ever met. It was a surprise to find out that they thought the movie &#8220;rocked&#8221;. In fact, they went so far as to say that &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; set a whole new standard for how much a movie can &#8220;rock&#8221;.<br />
Upon returning to the hotel, Nigel promptly went to bed. It was 9:30. I wasn&#8217;t even close to being tired. So I went back out. (I mistakenly thought that Neall went to bed as well, so didn&#8217;t bother to see what he was up to.) I wandered about the area around the hotel for a while, and then went for a walk.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before I stumbled across Seattle&#8217;s Monorail. It was the first (commercial) monorail built in the United States, constructed for the 1962 World Expo. It&#8217;s still running, and it looks 37 years old. It costs US$2.50 for a round-trip ticket from Westlake Centre (downtown) to Seattle Centre (where the Space Needles resides). The ride takes less than two minutes, and there are only two stations.<br />
Seattle Centre seems to be a bit of an amusement area. It has the Space Needle, the Pacific Science Centre, an IMAX theatre, a lot of amusement rides. From what I can tell, it&#8217;s what was left of the 1962 Expo. (Unlike Vancouver, which sold all the prime Expo land for a song, got nailed with the cleanup bill, and now have to pay exorbinant fees to buy an undersized condo there.)<br />
It took me about 10 minutes to realise that nothing was open, and I wasn&#8217;t about to fork out US$9 to go up the so-called Space Needle. I headed back to the hotel.<br />
We started off the next morning by taking our bags down to Neall&#8217;s car (so we didn&#8217;t have to lug them around all day) and proceeded to breakfast. Then it was off to more testing.<br />
Lunch was an adventure. Nigel sensed a disturbance in the Force (like I said, it would be like saying the Universe is big) &#8230; corn and salmon chowder. It was followed by a bizarre vegetable crepe-thing. I was beside myself &#8212; who in their right mind would feed video game developers this kinda junk?! I mean, really!<br />
After lunch, it was more testing. But we opted not to go the whole afternoon, and bailed after our 2:15 test slot. We wanted to escape Seattle traffic before it set in. We succeeded &#8230; only to land in Vancouver traffic. The latter is far worse.<br />
I arrived at home not long after 7pm, a bit tired, fairly hungry, and happy to be home. Hopefully, my next foray into the business trip world will be slightly more interesting&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, I did something a little different than usual. I went to Calgary.<br />
Alone.<br />
Well, not totally alone. I went to visit Stuart, who I had only seen for a whopping six hours at Christmas. Ideally, I would have also visited Therese, but she was off in Halifax on a conference, and visiting her sister. Also visiting that weekend was Jay, one of Stuart&#8217;s friends from college, whom I had come to know quite well.<br />
It was becoming the &#8220;Boy&#8217;s Weekend&#8221;.<br />
The original intention behind all this was to get together to work on a script that Stuart and Jay had been working on extensively, that I had started to contribute to a few months ago. The weekend happened to coincide with the release of Star Wars: Episode 1. Lucky us.<br />
When I arrived at Gate C34 at the airport, I noticed that there was a significantly larger number of people than there should be for a a flight not due to board for 40 minutes, let alone depart for an hour. It turned out that the flight before mine (also going to Calgary) was late.<br />
Quickly deducing that my flight would be late arriving in Calgary, I decided to try playing my cards. I walked up to the desk and asked one of the two attendants if the flight leaving was full. When she told me it wasn&#8217;t, I asked if it was possible to change my flight from the 19:40 flight to the 18:30 flight (it ended up being the 19:00 by the time it actually got going).<br />
A few minutes later, I was seated next to a window, waiting to get moving.<br />
Luckily for me, timing was everything that evening. Jay arrived a couple of hours ahead of me, so he and Stuart had gone out for dinner. Arriving early, I attempted to call Stuart&#8217;s thinking he might be there. He wasn&#8217;t. My next task was to have him paged.<br />
A moment after the page went out, I saw Jay and Stuart walking across the baggage claim floor. The weekend had begun.<br />
We retreated to Stuart&#8217;s apartment and watched &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, after engaging in a debate about where John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) appears in the movie. We were unsuccessful in our search. (Apparently he&#8217;s a Rebel &#8212; I mistakenly thought he was an Imperial.)<br />
The following morning, we headed out into the partially cloudy and somewhat rainy Calgary. Following breakfast at Denny&#8217;s (which left Jay and I feeling a bit odd for most of the day), we traipsed about the downtown before finally ending up at Eau Claire Market, where we indulged ourselves on video games. We were killing time. We were seeing Star Wars that night, so we couldn&#8217;t really go anywhere without coming back late.<br />
After a very small lunch, a couple of beers, and an IMAX movie later, we headed out towards the south end of Calgary. You really get an idea of how big Calgary actually is when you find it takes almost an hour to get from downtown to the south end. (Of course, we were driving through rush hour traffic, so that&#8217;s to be somewhat expected.)<br />
We were not alone in our vigil &#8212; several of Stuart and Therese&#8217;s friends were also attending the affair.<br />
We lined up just before 8pm in anticipation of the 10:10pm show. And just so you&#8217;re aware, there were others in the line before us &#8212; we weren&#8217;t the most desperate.<br />
The atmosphere once we got into the theatre was like waiting for a concert to start. Lots of talking and laughing &#8230; even a beach ball that was flung around the room (at least until the management took it away; we booed the usher for ruining our fun).<br />
It was an odd feeling, watching a new Star Wars movie. I couldn&#8217;t honestly tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen the original trilogy. We&#8217;ll just leave at &#8220;a lot&#8221;. We actually had to read the introductory text as it scrolled by. Our excitement was uncontrolled because, as Stuart put it, we didn&#8217;t know exactly what was going to happen in the next moment.<br />
A little over two hours later, we emerged from the theatre, mostly wired from some of the things we had seen. It was a good introduction to a long story (something that a lot of people were forgetting), with a lot of great action. We dreamed of many a lightsabre duel that night&#8230;<br />
The following morning, we decided we would head into the mountains. Jay had never been to the mountains, and wanted to see them up close. The weather was good, so we opted to take the day amongst the snowy caps of the Rockies.<br />
Before leaving Calgary, we picked up a friend of Jay&#8217;s who had moved to Calgary a year earlier, Kevin. Stuart knew Kevin through Jay, so I became the odd person out. Luckily, Kevin and I got along well, so it was a briefly-felt feeling.<br />
Following a quick lunch at Pete&#8217;s Drive-In, we hauled the hour and a half into the mountains. Jay (who had bought a camera that morning so he could take pictures) almost sounded like a little kid as he clicked away with his camera, recording the imagery for posterity.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Banff, although we were going first to Lake Lorna. Kevin quickly asked if any of us have been to Morraine Lake, to which the three of us all replied &#8220;no&#8221;. A third destination was added to the list.<br />
As we drove along, we discussed a great many things, including the things we would do once we finally got to Banff. We even discussed the pronounciation of Banff. Technically, it is &#8220;banff&#8221;. It quickly degraded to &#8220;bamf&#8221;. One of us saying &#8220;banff&#8221; or &#8220;bamf&#8221; was followed by three &#8220;bamf&#8221;s.<br />
Guys do weird things. Accept it.<br />
On the way to Morraine Lake, we noticed something. Snow. Yeah, I know, that sounds really dumb. But there was a lot more snow up there than we expected. This led to, of course, a snowball fight.<br />
It was short-lived (snowballs are really cold on unprotected hands).<br />
For those of you who don&#8217;t remember Morraine Lake (and yes, all you Canadians have seen it before), find an old CDN$20 bill. Flip it over. Voila! Morraine Lake. Didn&#8217;t even know it was that close to Lake Louise.<br />
The snow there was pretty deep, almost burying the sign that describes the significance of the area. Luckily, a lot of people had been there before us, so we could walk across the snow without falling in. This was a good thing for me, because in all my haste to pack for Calgary, I forgot to bring shoes. All I had were my sandals.<br />
Of course, this didn&#8217;t stop me from doing dumb things, like climbing the rock pile at the head of the lake with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. (Luckily, I have good sandals that grip almost anything, and the rocks were bare.)<br />
I was strange seeing Lake Louise again. The last time was a year and a half ago, when Gerry and I had stopped off on our way to Vancouver. Snow covered most of the mountains around the lake, and the lake itself still bore a sheet of ice. I felt sorry for Jay, not being able to witness the greeny-blue lake for himself.<br />
We wandered about the Chateau for a while, debated on crashing a wedding (again, it&#8217;s a guy thing; but don&#8217;t worry, we wouldn&#8217;t actually do such a thing &#8230; without good reason, that is), and eventually left for Banff (bamf).<br />
The townsite of Banff (bamf) hadn&#8217;t changed much in the year since I last visited (with Allison). After Stuart pulled into a well-hidden free parking spot (something that I wish I&#8217;d seen before), we proceeded to invade the downtown.<br />
It seems that Banff (bamf) was also invaded by a squadron of Air Cadets &#8212; they were everywhere. On every corner, and usually scattered about the middle of each block. It almost seemed Dickensian; I expected to see a military Fagin lurking around the corners.<br />
We wandered up Banff (bamf) Ave. towards the Park Administration building, then came down the other side. We stopped into various shops, but I abstained from buying anything &#8212; nothing there that really interested me. Jay and Kevin got sucked into a fudge shop where they indulged their sweet teeth. Tasty stuff, but it made my incisors vibrate.<br />
Finally, it was time for dinner (we really hadn&#8217;t eaten yet), so we headed towards St. James Gate, an Irish pub that Stuart recommended. As we headed over, we realised that we weren&#8217;t too far from Banff&#8217;s (bamf) movie theatre.<br />
It was playing Star Wars.<br />
They still had tickets.<br />
We figured popcorn would tie us over until we could get something else later.<br />
Emerging two hours later, hopped up on a heap of adrenaline from the lightsabre duels (yeah, we focused on that a lot), we went to dinner. A nice lamb stew and an Irish ale really hit the spot.<br />
After dinner, we ended up having to make a hard decision. Banff (bamf) is a great place to have fun. We thought we might stay the night, grab a hotel, and drive back in the morning. But then the little party-pooper in me thought about the plans for the next day &#8212; Drumheller. Driving from Banff (bamf) to Calgary and then to Drumheller wasn&#8217;t exactly something I wanted to do. It seemed it wasn&#8217;t something Stuart or Jay wanted to do either.<br />
The next time we&#8217;re in Banff (bamf), we&#8217;re spending the night, even if it means eight people crammed into a room.<br />
We arrived in Calgary an hour later, initially at a loss for something to do. We ended up downtown at a pub called &#8220;The Barley Mill&#8221;, where we swapped jokes, movie quotes, and work-related annoyances, quaffed a couple pints, and listened to some really great jazz.<br />
We got up a bit later the next morning, showered, hit Safeway to get hot dogs and buns, and headed out to Drumheller. I hadn&#8217;t been to Drumheller before, and really wanted to know what that area of Alberta was like. Jay hadn&#8217;t been there before either (he hadn&#8217;t been to Alberta before), and was excited about the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.<br />
It was a long drive. At least, it felt like a long drive. In reality, it probably wasn&#8217;t anything overly lengthy, but the heat and lack of features (it is the Prairies, after all) made it seem longer. Finally, the flatness gave way to an almost Grand Canyon-like valley (albeit significantly shallower), and the city of Drumheller.<br />
Drumheller is one of these strange cities that base their entire existence on one thing. Usually, that one thing is a resource (i.e. a mine). In this case, it&#8217;s dinosaurs. I&#8217;m really curious to know what would happen to Drumheller if the Tyrell had been built somewhere else.<br />
Our first stop was at McMullen Island, a small park where we had lunch. Then it was off to stare at Mr. T-Rex.<br />
I&#8217;ve been to a few museums now in Alberta, and I will say that they have some of the best ones I&#8217;ve ever been to. It&#8217;s really quite impressive. It&#8217;s not just a few piles of bones for you to stare at &#8212; they purposely lead you through exhibits leading to the rise of the dinosaur. Finally, by the time you reach the actual exhibits, you understand why the dinosaurs came to be.<br />
The museum works of the theory of evolution. You start with the single-celled organisms, progressing to the primitive ocean life. Then it&#8217;s on to the first plants on land, followed by the first land creatures. You start seeing the proto-dinosaurs, finally landing in a large room full of T-Rexes, triceratops, and Albertosauri.<br />
But the exhibits do not stop there &#8212; they continue on the evolution through the extinction of the dinosaur and rise of the mammal. They show you the birth of the sabre-toothed cats, the mammoths, and then take you to the ultimate mammal exhibit &#8230; the gift shop. Think about it &#8212; where else can you see the ultimate mammal in their natural environment?<br />
Returning to the outside, we wandered about the trails near the museum, looking at the rock strata that form the valley the museum sits in, the strata that contains the bones of dinosaurs appearing in the museum. Before hitting the trails, though, we endulged on some frozen treats to try and counteract the 30-someodd degree heat.<br />
A few times, as we walked about the rolling hills, we could hear good ol&#8217; Prairie Silence. For those of you who haven&#8217;t visited the Prairies and parked yourself in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the machines that make the noise we hear every day of our lives, you&#8217;ll never really know what it was like 100 years ago. The silence is truly deafening. (For reference, the only place I&#8217;ve ever been that was quieter was 150 feet below ground in a cave.)<br />
A short drive east from Drumheller took us to the Hoodoos. These are short clumps of rocks that have crowns. The crowns are make from less-soluable rock; they remain mostly untouched while the rocks beneath erode away. It makes for an interesting sight.<br />
Stuart, Jay, and I (mostly Jay and I) hiked to the top of the hill to see what we could see. There&#8217;s a lot out there.<br />
Another thing there was a lot of was sun &#8212; and I got a lot of it. Luckily, not so much to get a sun burn, but enough that my skin felt warm to the touch (even in the shade), and I really wished I had brought sun screen.<br />
Coming down the hill was a little harder than going up. Trying not to lose one&#8217;s footing when wearing sandals is a bit of a challenge, especially when the ground is crumbly. I slid a short distance down the slope, but quickly regained by footing.<br />
We stopped briefly at the Rosedale Suspension Bridge, put in place by the Star Mine company. The mines closed down in the 50&#8217;s, but the bridge continues to draw tourists. Rebuilt a few times since it&#8217;s original installation, the Suspension Bridge now features sturdy wooden towers and a steel grate floor.<br />
After stopping briefly to obtain liquid refreshment (we were quite thirsty by that point), we headed back towards Calgary. The drive back was surprisingly faster than the drive out, despite the fact that we ended up at the south end of the city, and had to travel for about 10 minutes along the Trans Canada to get back in.<br />
Stuart drove through the north of Calgary on our way back to his apartment, allowing me to see what the outskirts of the city look like. I cannot understand why anyone would want to live that far out. You might as well be living in High River for Airdale for all it really matters.<br />
We rented a movie (Rocketman &#8230; a surprisingly funny movie) and ordered Chinese. After the movie ended, we went out for a walk to a local sports bar, where we dove back into the movie script again.<br />
On the following morning, we headed out in search of Darth Maul action figures. Unfortunately, a few million people got there ahead of us. Both Toys &#8216;R Us and the Zellers we checked (not to mention the Bay) had their stocks depleted. Not a total surprise&#8230;<br />
Stuart took us downtown to his office, to show off his little piece of the advertising world. His company (Parallel) does some pretty amazing stuff &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s office is plastered with a lot of that amazing work. There are people whose abilities impress me &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s talent just plain frightens me.<br />
I remember his work when I was in high school. When I look back on his cartoony past and then look at the work he produces now, I admittedly get envious. He&#8217;s done very well on his skill, and it&#8217;s brought him many good things.<br />
We drove around Calgary for a little while, fairly aimlessly (we weren&#8217;t in any rush to go anywhere). We drove by Big Rock Brewery, for whom Stuart had done quite a bit of work. (Those of you in the Calgary area might see the billboards for &#8220;Kold&#8221; or the new Big Rock Brewery trucks with the beer bottles on the side &#8230; that&#8217;s Stuart&#8217;s handiwork.)<br />
At least some people get to see their work on public display. (For the record, Jay&#8217;s working on a kid&#8217;s cartoon show. He&#8217;ll get to see his work on TV.)<br />
As we began to drift in the direction of the airport, a sudden pang of guilt began to wash over me. In the hectic flow of the weekend, I had neglected to contact my relatives. As we were in the north-east anyway, I asked if we could quickly pop by my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home.<br />
I had been there twice before. I knew roughly where it was. But where I couldn&#8217;t remember the exact road to take us into their subdivision, Stuart did. He&#8217;d been there once.<br />
Stuart&#8217;s got a good road memory. (It also helps that he lives in the same city, and IKEA&#8217;s in the same area.)<br />
I got lucky, catching them after they had arrived home from camping. From Drumheller. The previous day. It&#8217;s truly a wonder that we didn&#8217;t run into each other over the course of the day.<br />
We talked for a while, while Jay put Maggie (my aunt and uncle&#8217;s dalmatian) into total submission. Jay&#8217;s got a way with dogs. Jennifer (my cousin) came tearing through the room at one point. She was about a foot taller than the last time I&#8217;d seen her, with shorter hair, and new braces. She smiled, said &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then tore back out of the room.<br />
<em>Sigh.</em> I remember being that age.<br />
Before long, we had to leave, and headed to the airport. Jay&#8217;s flight was before mine, and we didn&#8217;t want him to miss it. My flight wasn&#8217;t for an hour after his, so I would have time to kill.<br />
We bade Jay farewell as he disappeared behind the security wall and eventually onto Toronto. Stuart and I turned to dinner at the Harvey&#8217;s, before it was my turn to depart.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to friends, especially those that mean a lot in your life.<br />
Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see more of my friends this summer. Exactly when I&#8217;ll see them is a completely different issue. But with luck, it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s finally happened. I guess it was only a matter of time. Allison and I are going to prison.<br />
Specifically, the grounds of the former Oakalla Prison Farm, about a kilometre east of where we&#8217;re living now. We&#8217;re moving to a new apartment.<br />
This all started some time ago, when we came to the conclusion that our current apartment wasn&#8217;t quite living up to our needs &#8212; specifically, we desperately need a dishwasher, and would certainly find in-suite laundry useful.<br />
Our building has some quirks, namely all the services shut down at 10pm. This is a minor problem when you realise you&#8217;re out of clothes at 9:00 at night (yes, this has happened before).<br />
No, our kitchen does not shut down at 10pm, nor does the hot water shut off. However, we spend untold hours washing dishes. It&#8217;s become a nuisance in the grand scheme of wanting to go out and do things, not to mention the toll on my poor hands.<br />
It also doesn&#8217;t help that our dish rack began to fall apart last night.<br />
On Saturday morning, as we lazed about the apartment, Allison started perusing the classifieds (she will read most of the newspaper), and started reading off available apartments. I&#8217;ve been relatively content with the apartment, but Allison&#8217;s wanted something better for a while now. (Actually, that&#8217;s a really long story, which will eventually finish with us living on English Bay, but I&#8217;m not getting into that now.) I, of course, am always open to suggestions. (Hey, no snickering out there!)<br />
Allison&#8217;s pass through the paper led to a couple of possibilities, none of which were available for viewing. Giving it my best shot, I came across the entry: &#8220;Oaklands area. 6 appls, f/p, prkng&#8221;. Not a lot to go on, but I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot. We went over to take a look about an hour later.<br />
The Oakalla Prison Farm closed in 1990, after the site was deemed inappropriate for use (it was falling apart). The buildings were torn down in 1991, and the rest of the area left as a park. (Rather nice, isn&#8217;t it?) Polygon Homes bought the property and erected a rather large condominium complex.<br />
It&#8217;s a one-bedroom apartment that appears to have been bought by parents for their daughter. (That&#8217;s a guess, of course. We don&#8217;t actually know.) At any rate, the daughter was moving out, having bought her own place, and the parents wanted to rent.<br />
Allison&#8217;s eyes were immediately drawn to the moldings. She loves moldings. Sometimes, I think she just likes to say &#8220;moldings&#8221; &#8230; at least until we were in this apartment. Now I&#8217;m convinced she just wants moldings. I figure a few feet of nice moldings for her birthday will keep her happy.<br />
My mind was made up within a couple of minutes after entering the apartment. Allison&#8217;s mind was made up after she saw the laundry machine. We didn&#8217;t tell each other until we&#8217;d left the building and were preparing to leave.<br />
The layout was very well-designed: The kitchen was to the left of the door (no long, useless hallway in this unit), with a nice window into the living room. The living/dining room is a large space (the entire unit is 775 sq ft.) with a gas fireplace (the unit has radiant heat &#8212; a rather nice touch, if you ask me). To the right of the door is a short hallway, at the end of which is the laundry (to the right) and the bathroom (to the left). The bedroom is in the corner of the unit, next to the living room and bathroom. A walk-in closet should accomodate our clothes easily.<br />
And that&#8217;s just the apartment. Down the hall is a recreation room, including a universal gym. By comparison, our building has an exercise bike, treadmill, and stairmaster. We get two parking spots, full recycling (our building only has paper), storage and bike locker.<br />
The only thing our soon-to-be-apartment doesn&#8217;t have is a view. However, we can walk for one minute and get a view that&#8217;s much better than the one we currently have. Certainly no complains on my part&#8230;<br />
Well, maybe one small complaint. We had to make a trade-off in obtaining our new digs &#8212; convenience. Unlike our current apartment, the new pad isn&#8217;t really within walking distance of anything. It&#8217;s a very short drive, however, to all our favourite haunts. So it&#8217;s not really that big a deal. If we&#8217;re not pressed for time (which, realistically speaking, we won&#8217;t be now that we&#8217;ve got a dishwasher and laundry machine), we can still walk &#8212; it just takes longer.<br />
At any rate, we move on the 31st (hopefully the 30th, which is a Sunday) into our new place. The address is changing (I&#8217;ll send it along as soon as I remember what it is), but we&#8217;ll try to keep the phone number. No point in causing too much confusion.<br />
How long are we going to stay at our new place? Until we go to Europe, move downtown, or get bored of it and go somewhere else.<br />
Whichever comes first.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago, I made the decision to join the company softball team, the Rad Sox (Rad, as is &#8220;Radical&#8221;). This was for several reasons: I&#8217;d get out more, meet more people in the company that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have interaction with, hopefully improve my skills, and have fun.<br />
Two out of four ain&#8217;t so bad, I guess&#8230;<br />
We&#8217;ve played three games now, and we&#8217;ve lost each and every time &#8212; usually by a very unhealthy margin (our second game was something obscene, like 38 to 3). We practice a lot, usually without a lot of progress, it seems. Although my fielding is better, I still have problems.<br />
For example, on our Friday practice, I managed to somehow manage not to get my glove under the ball. So instead of the ball landing in my glove, it instead drove into the nail of my right big toe. Nearly bent the nail in half. Couldn&#8217;t walk very quickly for a couple of hours. Rather painful. Luckily, nothing was broken, and the bleeding was minimal.<br />
So let&#8217;s skip ahead to Monday night (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get back to the weekend in a minute). This was our third game, against some other company (we usually don&#8217;t know the names). I spent the first half of the game in the dugout (we have too many people for everyone to play the whole game). When my chance finally came up, I raced onto the field (mostly in an effort to warm up &#8212; it was very cold last night &#8230; did I mention that I&#8217;ve taken a strong dislike to the weather in this city?).<br />
I played third. First time that I was brought into the infield. Until then, I&#8217;d played the outfield &#8230; and sucked horribly. The coaches figured I needed the chance to suck on the infield. So I sat there, ready to play the role I was supposed to play. I made a catch, taking out a runner to third, and overall seemed to be doing pretty well.<br />
Until the next batter came up.<br />
She hit usually down the baseline, or bunted. Either way, Jon (the shortstop) suggested I play a bit closer to the baseline. Sure enough, next hit went straight towards me. It was an easy catch &#8212; the ball was rolling across the grass (albeit very quickly). I extended my glove, ready to snatch the rolling ball and throw it to first.<br />
The fields that we play on vary in quality. Some are pretty good. Some are really bad. And then there is Churchill (this is where we played last night). If you removed the grass, it would look a little like the surface of the moon.<br />
When the ball reached about two feet from my glove, it hit one of the many divots/dents/craters in the field and shot up at about a 45 degree angle. Although my brain could not tell my hand exactly where it was going to catch the ball, it did manage to tell my eyes to close and brace for impact.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how much inertia an ordinary softball travelling at 60km/h has. It&#8217;s also amazing how much abuse the human nose can take without breaking. But at least I stopped the ball.<br />
While I was reeling backward, trying to figure out whether or not I was upright or dead, the game continued until the ump had the notion to suspend play at one base (or something like that &#8212; you&#8217;ll forgive me if I didn&#8217;t pay a lot of attention to the game). I returned to the dugout to stop the bleeding (which didn&#8217;t take all that long, surprisingly). I stayed out for the rest of the game.<br />
So I&#8217;m now on partial DL until Wednesday, at which time I&#8217;ll figure out how I&#8217;m feeling. Hopefully, it&#8217;s not too bad&#8230;<br />
Anyway, back to Friday. Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, came out to visit for the weekend. Exact reasons, we didn&#8217;t know, only that she probably wanted to get away from home for a couple of days. I picked her up at the corner of Granville and W. Georgia, hopped a SkyTrain, and headed for the Old Spaghetti Factory in New Westminster.<br />
Allison appeared about a half hour after Jane and I got a seat, as the weekend traffic made getting across the bridge from Surrey rather difficult. We stuffed ourselves on OSF&#8217;s pasta and bread, all the while engaging in conversation.<br />
That evening, we took Jane to Playdium, to engage in some serious video-gaming. &gt;From 10pm until 4am, you can play as much as you like for $25. Yeah, it sounds expensive, but when you consider that most games cost $2 normally, it&#8217;s a really good deal. We played a good number of the games until about 1am, when we headed home exhausted.<br />
The next day, we drove down to Granville Island to spend an afternoon roaming around. After managing to find a parking spot (a bit of a feat, now that the traffic levels are beginning to skyrocket) we headed into the Island.<br />
Initially heading for food, we stopped to watch a busker. Allison and I had seen this act before, last summer. Joel from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (at which point everyone was instructed to say &#8220;Ooooooo&#8221;) was performing the trick made famous by Harry Houdini: Handcuffed, wrapped in chains, placed in a bag, and escape in under a minute. It&#8217;s actually a pretty simple trick, once you see how it&#8217;s done.<br />
I got abducted as his assistant. Oh yay.<br />
After he made a few cracks at my job (I never bothered to mention I work for a video game company &#8230; dopey me), I made an effort to cuff him very tightly. Further cracks wanted me to chain him as tightly as possible. I can only assume that&#8217;s why he does that. A poor girl from Delta (the equivalent of Brampton to Toronto) got suckered into checking his pockets for keys &#8230; something she really didn&#8217;t want to do.<br />
Needless to say, he escaped. In 57 seconds. He held out for three seconds to heighten the drama.<br />
Following lunch, we headed over to the Granville Island Brewery to have a tour, only we missed it by an hour. The next one was at 4:00. Back into the market to get dinner. We bought stuffed pork shops (which are *mighty* tasty, albeit huge), corn, and various vegetables for skewers.<br />
We missed the 4:00 tour because I couldn&#8217;t hold out any longer, and had to make a bathroom break. We took the opportunity, though, to get some beer and a bottle of wine.<br />
For my birthday, the Collins bought me a wine rack. Yes, a wine rack. It has a counter on top that we keep the microwave on. It&#8217;s very handy. Almost every time we go to Granville Island, we buy a bottle of wine. When we finally get the thing filled, we&#8217;ll actually start to drink it.<br />
We spend our time indoors, eating, drinking (beer and daiquiris) and watching &#8220;Home Fries&#8221;. Seriously messed up movie. Of course, it was written by Vince Gilligan, famous for writing seriously messed up X-Files episodes.<br />
Sunday was a weird day. Allison and I spend most of our time trying to kill time. After we sent Jane on her way, we needed to kill a few hours &#8212; we were going to a concert that night.<br />
I will admit that Alanis Morrisette doesn&#8217;t exactly rock my world &#8230; but she&#8217;s a pretty good performer, all things considered. She&#8217;s short (at least compared to the rest of her band) and quite energetic. Good live singing voice, too.<br />
The opening acts were Veda Hill (some local performer) and Sloan. Once again, Sloan&#8217;s bad luck with sound struck at them &#8212; the only reason I knew what song they were playing is because I could figure out the odd guitar chord and drum beat. It wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;Money City Maniacs&#8221;, their last song in the set, that the sound was reasonable. After Sloan&#8217;s set, Chris Murphy took a seat in the audience a couple rows behind us, just outside of arms&#8217; reach.<br />
The sound, of course, was tuned to Alanis. Despite the fact that she was over a half hour late hitting the stage, she put on a pretty good show. She did a very interesting rendition of &#8220;You Outta Know&#8221; &#8212; the music was extremely tame (no harsh guitars or heavy drums) for the first two verses. It really showcased the anger that the lyrics exude. Her encore I predicted about halfway through the show: &#8220;Thank You&#8221; and &#8220;Ironic&#8221;. But she didn&#8217;t end there, playing two more songs before coming back with an acoustical set. Quite impressive. She even let her pianist go nuts for a few minutes, showcasing some of the most amazing jazz-influenced talent I&#8217;ve ever heard.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a good weekend. Now if we can just warm this corner of the country up a bit, it&#8217;ll actually get liveable around here.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;The goats have been sucked.&#8221;<br />
That was how the Rad Sox season wound up Saturday afternoon. We started off the season with a fairly inspirational rallying cry before each game. However, as our less-than-stellar season progressed, the cry degraded to: &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221;<br />
Why goats? Dunno. It was Amy&#8217;s idea. We found it funny, and it put our games into perspective &#8212; don&#8217;t take it seriously. This was a good thing, considering how bad we usually lose. In our entire season, playoff games included, we stand at 24 games played, and only two wins.<br />
Yes, two.<br />
Why? Well, we were playing in a league with people who were (approximately) our age, unlike the &#8220;Old Sweaty Fat Guys&#8221; league the Sox were in last year. This, naturally, made them better than those in the &#8220;OSFG&#8221; league. We also had a problem of getting our key team members (i.e. the good players) to show up on a regular basis. This is partly the reason we lost all three of our games on Saturday.<br />
Triple headers hurt. Especially if they start at 8:00am. I pulled myself out from under the sheets at 7:07am, and managed to trudge my way into some clothes and get down to the car. Because we had to be at our field at 7:40 (so dictated by our coaches), I wanted to give myself a fair bit of leeway. It took (usually) 30 minutes to drive from Metrotown to Kerrisdale (where Allison used to live), so I figured on about 20 minutes.<br />
Even with a stop at Country Style to grab a dozen doughnuts, I still arrived 10 minutes early. No-one else showed until about 10 minutes later, during which I began to wonder if I was on the correct field. (I was, of course.)<br />
Our first game was against our arch-rivals, the Bladerunners. We don&#8217;t much like them. They&#8217;re really annoying. Their coach uses a kid&#8217;s toy megaphone. It&#8217;s annoying. Their first baseperson starts off every inning with a &#8220;Three up, three down, Bladerunners!&#8221; in a fake gravelly voice. She&#8217;s annoying. And although we creamed them 24-7 the last time we met, we lost by six runs. That was really annoying.<br />
Our game ended at 9:35, which meant we had just under four hours until our next game. It was time for breakfast. I headed downtown to meet the others for our morning meal. In the end, only Jonn and I ate, the others opting to work. (We&#8217;re on tight deadlines &#8212; two of our games are attempting to get out the door.)<br />
I returned to the office following breakfast to wait out the remaining hour or so by playing video games. Not even through my first lap in &#8220;Need for Speed III&#8221;, my phone rang. Allison was looking for her parents.<br />
The Collins&#8217; were coming over for the weekend to go to the PNE &#8230; and watch the Rad Sox lose two softball games. They were supposed to call Allison when they got downtown, before boarding a bus to Oakridge Mall (which is close to the baseball diamonds we were playing at). Allison was concerned that they were lost (even though the Collins&#8217; had travelled through Europe all on their own), and she was going to go find them. Thinking this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea (the Collins were to call our apartment, so I wanted Allison to stay), I offered to go look.<br />
I cut my game short, hopped in my car, and headed out to Oakridge. I parked at the Safeway (the Collins were supposed to be waiting there), and walked inside. No sooner had I reached the entrance to Safeway inside the mall did my phone ring. In fact, I was holding it in my hand, and had already dialled the first four digits of my home phone number. It was Allison. The Collins had called. They were in the food court.<br />
I waited with the Collins while they ate lunch, but had to head out to the ball park before Allison arrived. Even then, Allison and her parents were virtually right behind me, arriving mere minutes after me.<br />
Our second game was up against the Paper Kings. We like them a lot better than the Bladerunners. Very nice people. We had to borrow a player from another team (one of the nice people from the Bladerunners) because we were short a woman &#8212; we have to have at least three on the field at any time. We played a very close game, ultimately losing by only a couple of runs. Barb (our borrowed player) was dying in the field towards the end, desperately in need of a toilet. No sooner was the last out called that she took off across the field towards the washrooms, somehow still managing to cross her legs at the same time.<br />
Our third game was against the Tubeworms. They&#8217;re competitive. Not as bad as #69 on the Rippers (who would win the coveted &#8220;Jerk of the Year&#8221; award, if we had one in our league), but they just creamed us. Well, at least as much as a maximum of 10 runs can be considered a creaming. (League rules have a 10 run lead maximum during playoffs. There are a lot of weird rules in our league.)<br />
We sucked goats. Our last game was the worst of the three. Probably because we were exhausted &#8212; physically, and emotionally. You can only take a beating for so long before you become really frustrated. I know I was frustrated &#8212; my last up to bat of the year was a pop-fly after two horrible fouls. It put me in a pretty rough mood for the rest of the day.<br />
The next day was our trip to the PNE. We wanted to be there for the opening of the gates at 10:30 so we could quickly get into the PNE prize home. Every year since 1934 (not including the war years, when the PNE was used as a training camp and Japanese-Canadian internment centre), the PNE has offered a prize home. This year&#8217;s home is the largest ever offered: 4,189 square feet. It&#8217;s freaking huge. And frankly, not all that exciting. I&#8217;ve seen better. Like last year&#8217;s home. But it had a few design features we took away for use at a later date.<br />
We ventured through the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building, where you can literally buy nearly anything you&#8217;ve seen advertised on TV. It&#8217;s usually packed full of people and really annoying demonstrations offered by people wearing hands-free microphones with solid understanding of the human need to buy useless junk. Okay, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there are useful things in there, but you have to look for them. Like the fudge.<br />
We wandered around a bit, eventually finding ourselves at the Pig Races. We couldn&#8217;t actually see them, however, as there was a tremendous wall of people surrounding the spectacle. We continued on to the Petting Zoo. Mr. Collins looked like a little kid as he got in line.<br />
The Zoo is small &#8212; a gazebo about 30 feet across. Inside are chickens of various breeds, goats (old and young), sheep, donkeys, pigs, rabbits, chicks, ducklings, a couple of llamas, and lots of children. The animals are surprisingly content with people touching them all over.<br />
Following our visit with the kids, we took a short hike through Hastings Park. This is the fate of the PNE. Although the PNE has resided in its current location since 1910, the city of Vancouver is slowly converting it into an actual park. We saw Phase I for the first time this year &#8212; a second of ground that had been dug out for large ponds that had once been part of the midway. Over the next three years, most of the park will be torn up and replaced with trees and grass. The PNE&#8217;s days are numbered.<br />
You may be asking: &#8220;Why?&#8221; Simple answer: There&#8217;s no park on that side of town. More complicated reason: Although the PNE is the largest 4-H event in North America, it&#8217;s agricultural roots are beginning to die away &#8212; it&#8217;s really not the best place to hold these sorts of things anymore. There&#8217;s been talk for years of moving the agricultural events to Abbotsford, and the fair to Delta. At the moment, it&#8217;s only talk. The ultimate fate of the PNE is unknown, since no-one in government seems capable of making up their minds. It&#8217;s possible that in the struggle to sort all this out, the PNE might be brought to a final close.<br />
After lunch, we visited Hastings Racetrack, to watch the horses. I&#8217;d never been to horse racing before. I don&#8217;t have any great desire to go again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s (a little) fascinating to watch, but after two races, you get the general idea. Unless you&#8217;re into the betting aspect of it, there&#8217;s not much pull.<br />
It was then over to the Techni-Cal Superdogs show. We&#8217;d gone to the one last year, and thought it was pretty neat. This years show was, well, I leaned over to Allison just as the lights dimmed and muttered: &#8220;Let the cheese begin.&#8221;<br />
The show was held in the Pacific Coliseum, formerly home to the Vancouver Canucks. It was dubbed &#8220;Hollywoof&#8221;, and featured the &#8220;race to the moon&#8221; &#8212; a doggie obstacle course that pitted one side of the coliseum against the other. My frustration from the day before seeped back in as our side kept losing races.<br />
Sometimes, I think I&#8217;m not cut out for competition sports.<br />
The highlight of the show was a race between a 160-pound Rottweiler and a one-pound ball of fuzz, called Hiccup. The ball of fuzz won. The low point of the show was the introduction of the leader for the blue side (our side of the coliseum) &#8212; Captain Woof. He was described (rather accurately) by the leader of the red side as a &#8220;Village People reject&#8221;.<br />
Following the show, we went to see the Main Gate Theatre show. This was a production about the past 89 years of the PNE. It&#8217;s a musical, performed by four people (two men, two women) who appear to be theatre students. They&#8217;re pretty good actors, and decent singers. One of them looked a little like Gerry, but enough that I knew that it wasn&#8217;t him. Besides, I&#8217;ve heard Gerry sing&#8230; (Just kidding, Ger!)<br />
Then it was a race down to the Pig Races. Mr. Collins and I cut through a few hundred people and managed to save four seats on the bench to watch the races. The track is simplistic, a horseshoe-shaped track with a pool of water and a slide in the middle (this is for the duck races).<br />
Richard runs the thing. He started this many years ago, and spends most of the year touring with pigs and ducks. He told us that every May, he makes the trip from Woods Hole, Arkansas to Manitoba to collect four racing pigs. He then trains them (which he claims ain&#8217;t difficult) and takes them on tour.<br />
Pigs run pretty darn quickly. In fact, the actual race takes about 10 seconds. If that. So in order to make a show out of it, Richard also races ducks. They don&#8217;t race the same distance as the pigs &#8212; they go about a fourth of the distance, then up a ramp and down a slide into a pool of water.<br />
Then the pigs come out. Unlike the ducks, the pigs have names, such as Hammy Fay Bacon (Tammy Fay Bakker). Then the gate opens, they tear around the track, up a ramp at the other end, whip down the front of the cages to a dish containing exactly one mini-donut. That&#8217;s what the pigs race for. Frankly, I could understand that.<br />
I understood that so much that the first thing I did after the race was buy a bag of mini-donuts. They&#8217;re not quite as tasty as the Tiny Tom Donuts at the CNE, but they&#8217;re pretty darn close.<br />
After we pigged out on the mini-donuts, we headed out to get a hat. Bank 1, making a foray into the Canadian credit card market, was offering hats if you signed up for their card. This was when I temporarily lost the Collins&#8217;.<br />
I had to make use of the facilities. I raced in, telling the Collins they could keep going and I would catch up. When I came back out moments later, I couldn&#8217;t see them. So I raced into the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building to find them. I raced around for about ten minutes, somehow managing to miss two of them twice, before spotting Mr. Collins looking for me.<br />
Our PNE visit came to close. I was thankful for that &#8212; the lower half of my body was about ready to fall off. My legs were still reeling from the punishment I&#8217;d dealt them the day before. Allison&#8217;s feet were threatening to go on strike, so it was good timing on a whole.<br />
Undoubtedly, you may be wondering why it&#8217;s been a month since the last Observer&#8217;s Log. I&#8217;ve been busy. Really, really busy. With several major projects on the go at any one time, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of energy to whip one of these off. Not to mention that Allison and I have been laying low since the last weekend of July, to try and cope with the stress.<br />
However, it&#8217;s high time for an update, so I&#8217;m sending one out. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be a bit more frequent from now on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The shock came Thursday night, when I accidentally ran into the press conference while flipping channels &#8212; Gretzky was going to retire.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t help but think to myself: &#8220;Wow.&#8221; That was about all I could think of &#8212; this was a man who had been a name brand since I was seven years old. I remember reading my Owl Magazine in 1979, reading about some young hotshot about to enter the NHL, to play for some team in Edmonton.<br />
Two decades later, he left the NHL, taking his number with him &#8212; 99. Some say he was the greatest player who ever lived, some say he was the greatest player who will ever live. I say that when all&#8217;s said and done, Wayne Gretzky is The Great One.<br />
I watched the official announcement on Friday at work (we have TVs all over the hallways, which are regularly tuned to TSN or SportsNet &#8212; used to be ESPN, but we don&#8217;t like them anymore). We discussed amongst ourselves just what this announcement really meant to the world, and to each other.<br />
When Gretzky entered the league, it was a popular sport &#8212; mostly in Canada, and to a lesser degree, the States. Suddenly, this kid started tearing things apart. In a few short years, he brought the Oilers, previously thought of as some hick start-up, to victory in the Stanley Cup. Gretzky had made his mark &#8212; only he wouldn&#8217;t stop there.<br />
He kept going, and making marks wherever he stepped. The name Gretzky is synonymous with hockey &#8230; or perhaps, is hockey synonymous with Gretzky? Either way, both are changed for life. And Gretzky&#8217;s marks will probably never fade. The league is more likely to fade before The Great One&#8217;s legend.<br />
He is a legend, you know. His name is spoken in hushed tones when he enters a room. Kids (especially those playing hockey) are left wide-eyed and wide-mouthed should they ever see him in public. And with his seemingly doubtful return to hockey (or so says his father), his feats will be exaggerated, his skill embellished, and perhaps even his name dropped, until we know only of &#8220;The Great One&#8221;.<br />
In the meantime, the NHL is in trouble. Like when the NBA lost Jordon, the NHL is without the best ambassador it had for decades. There is no-one to pick up the torch. Sure, Jagr and Kariya have both been listed as the two most likely to become the &#8220;next&#8221; Great One, but they can never come close to being like Gretzky.<br />
Gretzky had presence. He had humility. He had patience. And above all else, he played for a team &#8230; not for himself. There is no-one playing hockey with those qualities. Perhaps in a few years, Gretzky may start coaching &#8212; maybe then he&#8217;ll train someone properly. But until then, the NHL will remain boxing on ice, with no-one to show what skill can do for the game.<br />
Saturday provided us relief from hockey, so that Allison and I could prepare ourselves for a later period in our lives. We babysitted (babysat? &#8212; aye, there&#8217;s the rub) for our friend, Kelly. And I mean baby &#8212; six months old.<br />
This we did as a favour, not because we really wanted to babysit &#8212; we had a lot of other things we needed to do that day. But in the end, it served as good practice for me. (Although, thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to change any diapers!)<br />
Gemma and mother appeared at about 1pm. After some quick instructions and presentation of Gemma&#8217;s things, Kelly quickly ducked out the door, and left her pride and joy in our capable hands.<br />
Okay, in *Allison&#8217;s* capable hands. Mine aren&#8217;t quite so capable.<br />
As was demonstrated when I decided it was time for Gemma&#8217;s lunch. You&#8217;d figure that somewhere along the line, instinct would lead you to want to eat. Through all my psychology courses, they told us about how repeated action leads to learning &#8212; you eat a few times, you&#8217;d think you&#8217;d remember how to eat. But no: &#8220;That spoon is a foreign object, and you gotta be kidding me if you think I&#8217;m gonna eat any of that Pablum, pal!&#8221;<br />
I got more of the Pablum on her face than in her mouth.<br />
After a little while, Gemma suddenly figured out I was giving her food. Suddenly, she couldn&#8217;t get enough. I was fighting for control of the spoon, holding the plate in place, and desperately trying to shovel as much Pablum and liquified squash as Gemma&#8217;d take. Then Allison took over for a while. After a few minutes, Gemma stopped eating.<br />
That afternoon, we realised why parents relish nap time &#8212; babies pass out, and stay that way for a few hours. We really noticed this when Gemma got up &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t too pleased about it.<br />
Kelly arrived just after 5:30 to remove Gemma from the premises, along with Allison&#8217;s old computer (having agreed to buy it).<br />
We were exhausted, and weren&#8217;t too keen on cleaning up so we could make dinner. So we went out to a nearby restaurant called (are you ready for this?) the &#8220;Seafood Shack&#8221;.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; sounds really classy, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
We didn&#8217;t know what we were getting into, but with an Entertainment Book coupon (allowing for a 2 for 1 special), we thought it was worth a try. We were quite pleasantly surprised: The decor was decent (furnished in late IKEA), the service was outstanding (except for how long it took to get the bill), and the food was &#8230; well, if you come to visit, we&#8217;ll take you there and let you judge for yourself.<br />
Allison dined on blackened Louisiana catfish on linguini, and having sampled a few pieces, I can safely say that it was very tasty. I opted for the Seafood Risotto. This was a wonderful melange of clams and mussels (both in the shell), with scallops, shrimp, and a thick, flavourful tomato sauce. The presentation of both dishes was exquisite.<br />
Sunday brought the day that most Canadians wish didn&#8217;t have to come &#8212; Wayne Gretzky&#8217;s last game. And for the blasphemy of all blasphemies, we didn&#8217;t watch the game. We had a good reason, though &#8212; we had to do all the errands we couldn&#8217;t do the day before (on account of having a baby temporarily disrupt our lives). But fear not &#8212; we did watch until the first commercial in the first period.<br />
And for the record, I would like to state that I accurately predicted the NHL&#8217;s decision to unilaterally retire the number &#8217;99&#8217; from all teams. It actually brought a tear to my eye.<br />
Gretzky is gone, and hockey will never be the same. I have found that I do want children, but not for a few years. I will now eat a lot more seafood than I would normally admit to. Maybe next time, I&#8217;ll be the one to change the diaper.</p>
