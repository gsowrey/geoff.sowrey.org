		<p>The clock, as they say, is ticking.<br />
In a few short hours, the last few seconds of 1999 will disappear somewhere just off the coast of New Zealand, and we&#8217;ll start to find out what we&#8217;re in for. Some believe it&#8217;s the end of the world, others believe it&#8217;s the end of our civilisation, and others believe it&#8217;s the end of the year. (Allison thinks that maniacs who spell &#8220;civilization&#8221; *incorrectly* (see the *correct* British spelling in the previous sentence) will be the death of us.)<br />
I believe it&#8217;s the beginning of the future.<br />
Sure, we may lose power for a few hours if something goes wrong, but that&#8217;s not going to wipe us all out. Rather, it&#8217;ll be the militants running amuck with a few tonnes of nitroglycerine. They&#8217;re the ones creeping me out. In many ways, I&#8217;m quite glad I&#8217;m sitting here in Nanaimo, away from the big cities. The worst that could happen is that I get stranded here when BC Ferries shuts down due to some unforseen navigation problem.<br />
Predictions are in order for such an auspicious occasion, and I find it hard to pass them up. So here&#8217;s what I think will happen tonight:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few places will lose power, either by some poor programming, by complete fluke, or through some maniac&#8217;s planning</li>
<li>Several thousand people will at some point lose their lives (this will come true regardless of what happens, based purely on the human death rate); whether this number spikes due to artificial designs (see the above-mentioned maniac) remains to be seen &#8212; expect several deaths due to drunk drivers</li>
<li>Hospitals around the world will be deluged by people convinced the world is going to end; there may also be a rush if the above artifical spike occurs</li>
<li>The banks will go on, as will your bank balances</li>
<li>Your computer will still start in the morning, provided you have electricity</li>
</ul>
<p>And my most Earth-shattering prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ll all be disappointed when nothing happens</li>
</ul>
<p>Leave it to the media to psyche this New Year&#8217;s way out of proportion, including the addition of the moniker &#8220;Millennium&#8221;. This is NOT the new Millennium, folks &#8212; that&#8217;s next year. (Don&#8217;t believe me? Answer this question: Was there a Year 0? Answer: No. Result, the decades actually *end* with &#8216;0&#8217;, such as 1950, 1970, and yes, 2000.)<br />
Oh yes, and unless Nostradamus&#8217; predictions come true in the next 24 hours (and I doubt they will [insert sound of me knocking on wood]), there will be no Earth-shattering earthquake that sends us BCers into the drink. (If not, I&#8217;ll have a *really* good story for you in about 24 hours or so.)<br />
So, with that, I leave you to the Most Overblown Festivities of the past Millennium (and yes, that you can actually bank on &#8212; there won&#8217;t be anything worse than this year), and I hope to see you all in the New Year.<br />
Provided the Earth doesn&#8217;t end, of course.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, another Christmas has come and (almost) gone. It was an unusual Christmas for me, mostly because things have changed. My family is bigger than it was, and I&#8217;ve got a few more traditions to start remembering.<br />
The first of these traditions is waking up at 8:00am. Around here, Christmas starts a bit earlier than in Oakville. This is primarily due to Mr. Collins, who was up at 5:00am, waiting for Christmas to begin. His energy certainly makes Christmas interesting.<br />
Collins Christmases are big events &#8230; much bigger than Sowrey Christmases (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with either of them). Waking up to a Collins Christmas means wading through to some place on the couch where you can spend a comfortable hour or two unwrapping presents. It reminds me of my childhood (no doubt in part to Mr. Collins&#8217; enthusiasm).<br />
Even the practice of opening a gift on Christmas Eve continues here. It&#8217;s a practice we Sowreys gave up a few years ago (I don&#8217;t even remember when), so it was a little strange to open a gift last night. But it really prepares you for the next morning.<br />
Generousity is the word around here. In fact, &#8220;give until it hurts&#8221; comes to mind. Over the course of the past 14 hours, I have received the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 CD: Harry Connick Jr. &#8211; When My Heart Finds Christmas (from my parents)</li>
<li>1 DVD: Saving Private Randy Special Edition (from the Collins)</li>
<li>1 Penguin Shaker (I&#8217;ll get back to this in a moment)</li>
<li>2 packs: Ferrero Rocher (3 chocolates to a pack) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Terry&#8217;s Chocolate Orange (Collins)</li>
<li>1 stick: deodorant (Collins)</li>
<li>2 rolls: 100 ASA film (Collins)</li>
<li>1 CD: Will Smith &#8211; Willennium (from Jane)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Sweet Story Book (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Night Before Christmas (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: Tom Clancy &#8211; Net Force (from my Nana)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shampoo (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shower gel (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bar: glycerine soap (Collins)</li>
<li>1 train whistle (sounds like a real whistle, too!) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Reach toothbrush (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Orange Crush(R) candy cane (Collins)</li>
<li>1 homemade orange bath balm/bomb (Collins)</li>
<li>1 feather duster (I think this was a hint) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Hershey Chocolate Storybook (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: The Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Personal Finance in your 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s for Canadians (from my sister)</li>
<li>1 book: The World Encyclopedia of Beer (from Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: beige with striping (Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: light green (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: button-down plaid (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: funky psychedelic black and white (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Motorcycle racing (from the Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 set: bar tools, including bottle opener and corkscrew (from the Vailmonts)</li>
</ul>
<p>That was just me. (Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad we brought the car.) Oh, and before your eyes bug out from the length of the above list, I would like to direct you to one little detail: a lot of the stuff on that list is &#8220;small&#8221; stuff, such as candy and books.<br />
Then there was the &#8220;collective&#8221;: Allison and I. Together we received:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bagel-sized toaster (Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 pizza stone with cutter and lifter (Collins)</li>
<li>1 spaghetti pot (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: chip bag clips (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: matching bathroom towels (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Sim Theme Park (Randy)</li>
<li>1 pastry blender (non-electric) (Collins)</li>
<li>3 tins: Misty Mountain Chocolate Paté (Collins)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to list Allison&#8217;s gifts &#8230; it&#8217;s already too much stuff. But like I said before: &#8220;Give until it hurts.&#8221; After this Christmas, Allison and I are going to make a donation to charity to compensate for the abundance of gifts. We are certainly thankful, and want to share thanks with others less fortunate than ourselves.<br />
Now, back to that Penguin Shaker. It seems that Santa made a visit last night that I wasn&#8217;t aware of (my Santa was very good at hiding things so I couldn&#8217;t see them packed into the car). I apparently made her, er, his &#8220;nice boy list&#8221;, and was therefore the lucky recipient of a Penguin Shaker.<br />
What&#8217;s a Penguin Shaker? Glad you asked. (Incidentally, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, this gets my CGOTY award (Cool Gift Of The Year). Back in the 30&#8217;s after prohibition was lifted, there was a big trend to martinis. The entire movement spawned a style that included penguins (tuxedos; ice). Thus was born the penguin-shaped martini shaker. The basic shape is of a martini shaker, with two wings, and a beak. The beak has a plug at the end that (when unscrewed) acts as a spout; a built-in filter prevents the ice from coming out. It&#8217;s silver-plated and utterly gorgeous.<br />
Following the unwrapping, we proceeded to breakfast, courtesy of Master Chef Randy. Then it was helping Mrs. Collins prepare the evening&#8217;s feast of roast beast. (Okay, turkey, but the Dr. Seuss in me was yelling to get out.) I spent a large portion of the afternoon chopping.<br />
When the rest of the family arrived this evening, we exchanged a few more gifts, and then proceeded to dinner. Not much different than a Sowrey Christmas dinner, except that it&#8217;s a lot quieter here. (Those of us who remember the Sowrey/Sinnott dinners will remember the struggle to gain control of the table&#8217;s conversation.)<br />
After dinner, we all broke up into various conversations. Allison adjourned downstairs for a while to use Randy&#8217;s PlayStation, where Allison totally wiped the walls with me. Allison is the video game equivalent of a pool shark &#8212; she starts off making you feel good, and then cleans your clock. I lost a few layers of skin (not to mention several notches on Ye Olde Ego Meter) when she trounced me 12-0 on Triple Play 98.<br />
I hate sports games.<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a poor loser. I get frustrated easily. I like being able to do *something* other than *nothing*. That&#8217;s when I get labelled &#8220;sore loser&#8221;. Things I need to work on for my New Year&#8217;s Resolution, I guess.<br />
Anyway, that&#8217;s a Collins Christmas for you. &#8216;Tis time for me to consider getting ready for tomorrow &#8230; who know&#8217;s what it will bring?<br />
Merry Ho-Ho!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Twas the night before Christmas,<br />
And all through the house,<br />
Not a creature was stirring,<br />
&#8216;Cause they were all at the hospital.<br />
Well, briefly anyway.<br />
Our evening was off to a startled start, after Allison required immediate medical attention. This goes back to last Tuesday, when Allison had to have minor emergency surgery to eliminate some major pain. The incision she received was not sutured closed (as per the type of surgery).<br />
This evening, it gave her a bit of trouble. Allison had been instructed to visit Emergency in the event her wound acted up. As it stands, it was a normal (in the sense that most people who get that kind of surgery often have some kind of trouble) and we went home.<br />
Then it was off to Allison&#8217;s grandparents for the traditional Christmas Eve visit. This, of course, is a new thing for me. I&#8217;ve never been through a Collins (or Vailmont) Christmas before &#8212; I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect.<br />
Singing. I should have seen it coming.<br />
Carols, to many of which I have since forgotten the words; some I&#8217;d never even heard before. Mrs. Collins and Grandma Vailmont were belting out the majority of the lyrics, although we had a small argument about the words to &#8220;Frosty the Snowman&#8221;.<br />
Tomorrow is my first Christmas away from my family. So yes, it does hurt a little. My parents and my sister aren&#8217;t by my side (or me by theirs). And due to Allison&#8217;s aforementioned surgery, we won&#8217;t see them this holiday season at all.<br />
Originally, we had planned to visit Florida on vacation, and would spend some time with them. However, Allison&#8217;s doctor has effectively forbade her from travelling for six weeks (now five). So we had to cancel our flight. Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad that for the first time, I bought flight insurance.<br />
At least we could travel to the Island, even if we had to sit in the ferry lineup for (are you ready for this?) four hours. And we were there early.<br />
Which reminds me of a detail I keep forgetting. Many of you have wondered when we&#8217;re getting married. You know that we got engaged, but the date kept changing. It&#8217;s official: 26 August 2000. The wheels are in motion. So why does taking the ferry remind me of the wedding? Those of you who will be driving will want reservations so you don&#8217;t have to experience sitting in a lineup for hours on end. It&#8217;s particularly bad in the summer.<br />
Anyway, Christmas is fast approaching. But I&#8217;m doing just fine. Sure, I miss my family, but I&#8217;ve got an extended one here that cares for me. It&#8217;s great to feel wanted, particularly after years of making myself feel otherwise.<br />
So for those of you who get this on Christmas Day, I wish you a very Merry Christmas (or Happy Holidays, depending on which you prefer). For the rest of you, I hope you had a great time.<br />
Expect more within 24 hours&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than seeing the look of complete terror upon someone&#8217;s face. Especially if you know there&#8217;s a benevolent force behind it. Such as with a surprise party&#8230;<br />
Allison&#8217;s birthday was on Sunday past. And I wanted to make it something special.<br />
So at the beginning of November, I started contacting her friends, seeing who I could get to come out and scare the bejeezus out of my fiancée. I knew that I had to start early, because it takes a while to plan out all the little details. And it doesn&#8217;t matter how straight-forward something seems &#8212; there are *always* little details.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d organised a surprise party was when my close friends Stuart and Therese announced they were moving to Calgary. I wanted to give them a farewell present, by showing them how much their friends would miss them. The party was as much for me as it was for them&#8230;<br />
Planning it had been a nightmare &#8230; the logistics were murder. While Therese and Stuart were wandering about Europe, I had been pulling together their friends (with the help of Therese&#8217;s friend Rachel and Stuart&#8217;s friend Jay) and planning out all the details. How?<br />
Rule #1 when planning a surprise party: Get the parents involved.<br />
Why? Simple: If you don&#8217;t tell the parents, they&#8217;ll inevitably screw up your plans. Not intentionally, mind you, but they&#8217;ll do something that will make your well-laid plans worth sqwat. (Yes, &#8220;sqwat&#8221;.) So, if you get the parents involved with the process, you don&#8217;t have to worry about things backfiring on you.<br />
That&#8217;s how I succeeded with Stuart and Therese&#8217;s party &#8230; and that&#8217;s how I succeeded with Allison&#8217;s party. The best part is, most parents are clever &#8212; they&#8217;ll suggest good ideas without you have to tell them what to do. In the case of Allison&#8217;s parents, they invited Allison over to Nanaimo for her birthday. This left our apartment open.<br />
So brought about the second problem: How to get people into our apartment to surprise Allison. This took a lot longer than I thought it would, and the ultimate solution was so simplistic I had to kick myself for not thinking of it earlier. Keys. Cut a spare set of keys, and leave them with a friend.<br />
Then it was setting up a decorator, and making sure that our Key Master would arrive before everyone else. Where we would go for dinner &#8230; even a theme for the evening.<br />
But above all else, the hardest thing to do was keep Allison in the dark. She&#8217;s a smart cookie, and it&#8217;s really hard to keep things from her. Especially when it comes to her birthday. Luckily for me, Allison&#8217;s parents were running a good cover for me.<br />
We left on Friday the 3rd, catching the late ferry to Nanaimo. This gave me enough time to clean up the bedrooms. We did this under the guise of not having enough time to clean before Allison&#8217;s aunt appeared on Monday for a visit. (I hadn&#8217;t asked her aunt to come the day after Allison&#8217;s birthday as an added distraction &#8230; it just kinda worked that way.)<br />
But we didn&#8217;t get everything. Allison&#8217;s insistence that we leave negated any argument I could have to clean the kitchen table. I didn&#8217;t want to have papers all over it when her friends showed up.<br />
The wonders of today&#8217;s modern technology no longer amaze me &#8230; I use them with gusto. I made several calls over my cell phone to Michelle (our Key Master) and begged her to clean off the kitchen table before people started to show up.<br />
(There&#8217;s always one thing that doesn&#8217;t go quite right.)<br />
Allison&#8217;s family birthday party was the next day, the 4th. This amounted to a wonderful dinner of salmon, which Allison had asked for. Also on the menu was chocolate cake. This was no ordinary chocolate cake, mind you &#8212; this was the King/Queen of Chocolate Cakes. It was called something like Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Whipped Chocolate Filling, or something like that.<br />
It was evil.<br />
In a chocolatey good way, that is. I have never, ever has such a devilishly good chocolate cake in my life. (I&#8217;m actually beginning to salivate, just thinking about it.) I can&#8217;t even begin to describe what was in this thing &#8230; all I know is that it was really, REALLY good.<br />
The next day, we were to leave on the 1:00pm ferry. We would arrive in Horseshoe Bay around 3:00pm, and back at our apartment around 3:30. We would talk, chat, whatever for about two hours, and then go to dinner.<br />
That was the plan. But plans have a way of not working exactly as planned.<br />
The ferry was at 12:30, not 1:00pm.<br />
I started to panic a little.<br />
It was a fast ferry. We would arrive nearly an hour before we were supposed to.<br />
I started to panic a lot.<br />
Miracles of modern technology. I called Michelle, and let her know that things were not as well-planned as I had hoped. We tried to figure out what I could do to stall. I had suggested taking Allison to lunch, but she wanted to eat something on the ferry &#8230; that ruled out lunch at the other end. I couldn&#8217;t take the long way home, as it would make her suspicious. Feigning car trouble wasn&#8217;t even a thought &#8212; BCAA would put an end to that right quick.<br />
Then Allison proposed the solution herself &#8212; she wanted to go to IKEA. That would blow an hour and a half, easily.<br />
So it was with much relief that we bypassed our apartment completely and went directly to IKEA. It was a failed mission, in that respect &#8212; the chair covers we had gone looking for were not to be found. IKEA didn&#8217;t carry them in the style we thought they would. We headed home, Allison a little apprehensive about what I had planned for her.<br />
When we arrived (at nearly 4:30, about an hour late because of nightmarish traffic going back), I made sure to grab all the bags, thus tying up my hands so I couldn&#8217;t open the door. No, it&#8217;s hardly chivalrous. but I had to make sure that Allison was the first into the apartment. As we passed the security camera, I looked, waved, and smiled. Because I knew that the 12 people sitting in our living room were watching Channel 59 &#8212; the security camera channel. They knew we were there.<br />
The elevator was a bit slow, by my heart was racing. It was part anticipation, and part realising that maybe this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea. But it was too late, so I concentrated on the anticipation. The hard part was not showing it.<br />
The elevator took forever to finally deposit us on the 6th floor. I exited first, but let Allison lead the way. As we got to the door, I saw that our weekend paper was still wedged in the mail slot &#8212; our awaiting guests had not removed it. I was excited beyond repair. Allison had no clue what was about to happen.<br />
She got in, remarked that the bathroom door was closed (our friends had tossed their shoes in there). The lights were off and it was dark inside, which was good because if we could see, Allison would have seen some of the snacks left on the counter in our kitchen. But she didn&#8217;t see it. (Mind you, Allison saw the extra jackets in the closet, and *still* didn&#8217;t clue in.)<br />
Then it came. A giggle. From someone in the living room.<br />
Allison gasped. Someone was in the apartment. Someone had broken in, and they were still there! As the onset of sheer terror was about to take effect, a very loud and resounding cry was heard (probably through the entire building): &#8220;SURPRISE!&#8221;<br />
Several camera flashes went off. I&#8217;m told the pictures are priceless.<br />
I nearly fell over laughing. Yes, I&#8217;m cruel. I admit it. It was mostly from pure relief that things worked out, after all. (Although for another 20 minutes or so, I was still a bit edgy, wondering if Allison was all right with everything.)<br />
The group went out to dinner at a restaurant not far from our apartment. Wasn&#8217;t the best overall venue, I&#8217;ll admit, but it was the best choice given the size of our party. The place would probably be more interesting later in the evening.<br />
After dinner, most people went their separate ways. (It was a Sunday night, after all, and many people had to go to work the next day.) But Michelle (our Key Bearer), Mike (her husband), and Tyler stuck around. It seemed that there were other things in the evening that I had not planned.<br />
The evening became organic, developing its own events as we went along. We started off at Commodore Lanes, with some five pin bowling. I&#8217;ve discovered how to beat Allison in five pin: Get drunk. Both of us. Her bowling average goes way down, and mine goes way up. (Otherwise, Allison is virtually unbeatable in five pin.) The five of us had a grand old time being really lousy at many things. Especially table hockey. I&#8217;ve always been a lousy player. And foosball. I got creamed at that.<br />
After our bowling excursion, we ended up at Death By Chocolate on Burrard. One of us mentioned that it was Allison&#8217;s birthday. When her dessert showed up, it had a candle on it. Our server just stood there, waiting. Finally, she said: &#8220;C&#8217;mon folks, work with me here.&#8221; We sang Happy Birthday, and indulged in really bad things for us to eat&#8230;<br />
The day so ended as we headed home. Overall, it was a good day, all stress aside. Now I just have to figure out how to outdo myself next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this was certainly a learning experience. Last week, I sent out a survey (sent to me by a friend) that lets people know how much they know about you. It&#8217;s quite informative. After receiving a couple of responses, I thought I&#8217;d compile them. Some are pretty funny, depending on how you know me. Some are very accurate. These are *completely* anonymous (and in random order), so don&#8217;t be worried that I might single you out.<br />
I started off with the following lyric:</p>
<blockquote><p>Run my name through your computer,<br />
Mention me in passing to your college tutor,<br />
Check my records, check my facts,<br />
Check if I&#8217;ve paid my income tax,<br />
Roll over ev&#8217;rythin&#8217; in my CV,<br />
But you&#8217;ll still know nothing &#8217;bout me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of you guessed it right &#8212; the author in question is Sting. Specifically, the lyric is from &#8220;Nothing &#8216;Bout Me&#8221;, the last track on &#8220;Ten Summoner&#8217;s Tales&#8221; (released 1993).<br />
And so, on with the results! Any comments I supply will appear in &#8216;[]&#8217; brackets.<br />
&#8212;<br />
1. My name:<br />
The real answer is, duh, &#8220;Geoff Sowrey&#8221;. Most of the results were correct. There were a few oddities, such as &#8220;Geoff Sowery&#8221; [note the slight misspelling of the last name] and &#8220;Goff Sowrey&#8221; [note the *intentional* misspelling of my first name]. But otherwise it&#8217;s good.<br />
2. Where did we meet?:<br />
There is obviously no right answer for this one. I met a lot of you in lots of strange and interesting places, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>High school</li>
<li>University of Waterloo, Village Two Residence, South A floor, TV   lounge</li>
<li>High school. Chris&#8217; and my birthday parties</li>
<li>Gah&#8230; University of Waterloo, South A.</li>
<li>235 Gordon Street, Guelph, most likely at a party, oui?</li>
<li>University of Waterloo (more specific?  Umm, camping?)</li>
<li>Arkillago [aka Arkipelago]</li>
<li>113 George Street, Toronto, Ontario [aka Arkipelago]</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Take a stab at my middle name..:<br />
This was a good one. I didn&#8217;t realise how few people knew my middle name. It&#8217;s fairly uncommon (or at least it was until shows such as &#8220;Due South&#8221; and &#8220;ER&#8221; made it a little more mainstream): &#8220;Benton&#8221;. A couple surveys had correct answers. The rest believed it was one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Robert</li>
<li>propellerhead [??]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [more like a nickname from university]</li>
<li>Patrick</li>
<li>Archibald [this submitter did quickly follow up with the correct name]</li>
<li>Edward</li>
</ul>
<p>4. How long have you known me?:<br />
I&#8217;ve known some of you a very long time (some of you receiving this who didn&#8217;t do the survey have known me since the moment I was born &#8212; Hi Mom! &#8212; some of you not quite as long, but almost). The survey respondants gave me a range of between two and 13 years. One answer was fairly specific: &#8220;8yrs 2mths 7 days&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m beginning to feel a little older now&#8230;<br />
5. How well do you know me?:<br />
Okay, this is totally subjective. How do you determine how well you know someone? You may know someone quite well, and then they move away or go to school. Suddenly, you don&#8217;t think you know them as well as you did. Things change&#8230;<br />
The respondants were all over the board on this. Some claimed they didn&#8217;t know me well at all (which is to be expected) to knowing me quite well. Oddly enough, no-one claimed to know me well enough to say I was &#8220;predictable&#8221;. I guess that means I&#8217;m doing something right for a change&#8230;<br />
6. Do I smoke?:<br />
Everyone had the right answer on this. However, I will quote one of them, because I thought it was appropriate: &#8220;dear god no&#8221;. One of the respondants did have a good point, though: &#8220;Don&#8217;t think so, then again, you didn&#8217;t drink either.&#8221;<br />
7. Do I believe in God?:<br />
Okay, here&#8217;s a touchy subject if I ever heard it. But I&#8217;m not keen on starting any fires that might take time to extinguish, so I&#8217;m just going to say: If you don&#8217;t know, don&#8217;t worry. I don&#8217;t get offended easily. But I do have to quote a reply, it&#8217;s just too good: &#8220;someone has to be held reponsible for creating you&#8221;.<br />
8. What was your first impression when you first saw me?:<br />
This was a good one. This is where the true me starts to show through. Okay, you can all stop laughing now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>That guy is a looney</li>
<li>What&#8217;s with the sandals?</li>
<li>Son of Worf [just remember me with a beard and long hair]</li>
<li>shy, eager to be friendly</li>
<li>Loves computers.</li>
<li>loud [no comments from the peanut gallery, please]</li>
<li>what a spaz!</li>
<li>very intelligent person, with a few quirks [a *few*?]</li>
<li>looks friendly, not like that scary Justin guy or that shifty little   Jim, and he doesn&#8217;t smell as bad as that Rob guy.</li>
</ul>
<p>9. My age?:<br />
My age (current) is 27 years, 4 months, and 9 days. However, I&#8217;ll take 27 as the answer. A couple put down 26 [thanks for making me feel a little younger], two put down 28 [close, but no banana], and one thought I was &#8220;late gen X&#8221; [AIIEEEEEE! I could be as old as 38!].<br />
10. Birthday?:<br />
The correct answer is 16 July 1972 (I will accept July 16 1972, of course). Some responses claimed it was &#8220;July&#8221; [close enough], &#8220;sometime in the summer&#8221; [sorry, but Alex Trebek would ask you to be more specific], and &#8220;you have one each year&#8221; [doesn&#8217;t everyone?].<br />
11. Color hair?:<br />
Officially, brown. Every response was correct. Luckily for you folks, I haven&#8217;t taken to dying my hair.<br />
Yet.<br />
12. Color eyes?:<br />
Allison tells me they&#8217;re green. I always thought they were kinda bluish. I just stared in the mirror. They&#8217;re kinda greeny. Heck, *I* don&#8217;t know what colour my eyes are. So I really don&#8217;t mind that the replies varied from brown to hazel to blue to green. (Yes, there is at least one person who agrees with Allison.)<br />
13. Tall / average / short / fat / average / thin?:<br />
Most of the answers were &#8220;average / average&#8221;. I guess that was to be expected&#8230;<br />
14. Do I have any siblings?:<br />
One. A sister, Cathy. Most were right (although only a couple knew her name), a few got this wrong.<br />
15. (If opposite sex) Have you ever had a crush on me?: (If same sex) Have you ever been jealous of me?:<br />
This was one of the few questions I was hoping for good answers. My ego running wild, I guess. Either way, all but three respondants completely shot me down (thanks, guys). Apparently, I&#8217;ve never been the sort to attract others &#8230; the nearest I got to others having a crush on me was &#8220;officially, no&#8221; and &#8220;A crush no, but I would say we use to have a close bond&#8221;. Only one of the same sex was ever jealous of me. Oh, and there was that one joker who *had* to write: &#8220;(Ha, ha, ha, ha!)&#8221; [insert sound of ego deflating].<br />
16. Whats one of my favorite thing to do?:<br />
Again, some pretty strange responses here. People have some pretty interesting ideas of what my favourite things are. (Everyone knows it&#8217;s bright paper packages tied up with string&#8230;) Answers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer stuff</li>
<li>bike really long distances once in a while</li>
<li>make trouble with Stuart with Chris</li>
<li>Play on computer, write, eat ice cream.</li>
<li>play Doom</li>
<li>eat and imbide Guiness</li>
<li>play video games (it used to be Quake&#8230;?)</li>
<li>Watching/talking/re-enacting Star Wars. [I&#8217;m not that bad! Really!]</li>
<li>Used to be watch sci fi, hang out with friends, go to Jack Astors,   ride your bike, and travel.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Sigh* The things I used to to &#8230; wait a minute, I still do most of those. At least whenever possible.<br />
17. Do you remember one of the first things I said to you?:<br />
This varied for a few people. The most obvious answer was &#8220;Hi&#8221; or &#8220;Hello&#8221;. (I have a tendency of saying that when I meet people for the first time.) However, a few of you received quite different first words:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;What channel is Animaniacs on?&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I wrote this program to enhance this computer game&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li>Actually, it was a huge rant about running into Chris on your bike,   and getting invited to said birthday party [I was ranting? Me? Rant?]</li>
<li>no but I remember a math textbook falling on my head [This is from my   high school locker victim, er, partner]</li>
</ul>
<p>18. What&#8217;s my favorite type of music?:<br />
Wow. This one was fun. I knew I was going to get some pretty bizarre answers. For record, everyone was correct on this. It all depends what musical phase you caught me in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beatles</li>
<li>Sting, Sarah [Mclachlan], .. whattya call that?</li>
<li>80&#8217;s pop music [okay, what child of the 80&#8217;s *didn&#8217;t*like that   music?]</li>
<li>Rock</li>
<li>ANY bloody type [Technically, the correct answer]</li>
<li>Sting obviously (that should get me the bonus question eh?)</li>
<li>skit songs from Monty Python</li>
<li>new rock (alternative)</li>
<li>you like everything [again, the technically correct answer]</li>
</ul>
<p>19. What is my best feature?:<br />
If it were possible to blush through email, I would. Many of the answers were quite generous. I should have added a question: &#8220;What is my worst feature?&#8221; I think that would be just as telling.</p>
<ul>
<li>very sweet and generous person</li>
<li>friendly nature and honesty</li>
<li>sense of humour</li>
<li>loyalty, selflessness</li>
<li>Down to earth (wow, that was a surprise!)</li>
<li>Allison.  (Ha, ha, ha.) [This is the same joker who laughed earlier]</li>
<li>friendliness earnestness oops thats two</li>
<li>Smile</li>
</ul>
<p>20. Am I shy or outgoing?<br />
Over the past few years, many people have attempted to tell me what I am. There are those who told me that my hyperness was a cover for my shyness. There are those who told me that I come on too strong. It seems that most people can&#8217;t really decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outgoing especially when chocolate is consumed</li>
<li>both</li>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>shy, becoming more outgoing</li>
<li>Outgoing most of the time</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re outgoing, but you&#8217;re really shy</li>
<li>outgone [I take that means I&#8217;m past going?]</li>
<li>outgoing externally, but internally shy</li>
<li>Definitely outgoing</li>
</ul>
<p>21. Would you say I am funny?:<br />
Generally, this was &#8220;yes&#8221;. The range basically went from &#8220;very&#8221; to &#8220;maybe just a little&#8221; [although I detected an ode of sarcasm on that one].<br />
22. Am I a rebel or do I follow all the rules?<br />
This one was nearly as polarised as #20 &#8212; I obviously put across some very different vibes to people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules, unless you are hanging around Chris.</li>
<li>rebel but in an off the wall way</li>
<li>Well, you don&#8217;t follow ALL the rules, so &#8220;rebel&#8221; it is.</li>
<li>a little of both</li>
<li>Middle of the road</li>
<li>rebel</li>
<li>follow the rules (in general)</li>
<li>you think you&#8217;re a rebel, but you follow the rules, pretty much to a   &#8216;t&#8217; [Ouch! That&#8217;s gonna leave a mark&#8230;]</li>
</ul>
<p>23. Any special talents?:<br />
How do you define a &#8220;special talent&#8221;? I never thought of myself having a talent &#8212; I can&#8217;t act, I can&#8217;t draw (at least without the aid of a computer), I can&#8217;t sing (most of you know that). Okay, I can write (most of you know that) &#8230; but write well? That&#8217;s another issue. The respondants thought I had a few interesting abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;out of box analytical thinking&#8221; is not your average skill&#8230;</li>
<li>excellent writer, great imagination</li>
<li>story telling &#8211; in great detail</li>
<li>many. being a great friend amongst them. Computer knowledge too.</li>
<li>Prolific writing, belching</li>
<li>geez, i dunno &#8211; other than programming?</li>
<li>Playing baseball in flip-flops [when did I do this??]</li>
<li>too many to list. certainly not a couch potato</li>
<li>Never-ending energy</li>
</ul>
<p>24. Would you consider me a friend?:<br />
As a rule, I don&#8217;t make enemies. I don&#8217;t like them. So I generally make (and try my best to keep) friends. It&#8217;s not easy &#8230; particularly when most of them live outside the province. Most replies seem to agree with me on that. A few expressed concerns that perhaps the friendship is waning a little due to the march of time, but I think friendship continues beyond that. If you&#8217;re receiving this email, it&#8217;s because of one of two reasons:<br />
a) You&#8217;re family (or about to be family). b) You&#8217;re a friend.<br />
25. Would you call me preppy, slutty, a homie ,average, sporty, punk, hippie, glam, nerdy, snobby, or something else?:<br />
Wow. Some really crazy answers here. I&#8217;ll let them speak for themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are something else alright. You never remained the same for long   periods of time.</li>
<li>wackey, understanding, talented and more.</li>
<li>smartypants</li>
<li>Hmm, I&#8217;ll choose &#8220;hippie.&#8221;</li>
<li>average [two people thought this]</li>
<li>Edgy (when playing Doom with Scott lurking about the house). [The   Scott in question is from University.]</li>
<li>hippie with a touch of nerdy</li>
<li>dog gone nutty</li>
</ul>
<p>26. Have you ever seen me cry?:<br />
Not many people have seen me cry. Those of you who have probably know me better than anyone else.<br />
27. If there were one good nickname for me, what would it be?<br />
Ah yes, the ubiquitous nickname. I&#8217;ve had a lot of these in the course of my life. I wish I&#8217;d recorded them all &#8212; it would be interesting to see how my nicknames evolved as I got older. At the moment, my nicknames appear to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grapes [my old boss gave me this &#8230; still don&#8217;t know why]</li>
<li>Goff</li>
<li>Ge-off [pronounced &#8220;gee-off&#8221;]</li>
<li>Son of Worf [although I haven&#8217;t really gone by this in a while]</li>
<li>Pepe Gonzales [??]</li>
<li>Han Solo [I feel like a scruffy nerfherder&#8230;]</li>
<li>Propellerhead</li>
<li>Celery [wow &#8212; that&#8217;s one I haven&#8217;t heard since I was a kid!]</li>
<li>Macgyver [Yes, like the TV show &#8212; I got that from my dad, although he   wasn&#8217;t in the survey]</li>
</ul>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sometimes I wish we celebrated American holidays. At least then we&#8217;d   have one more Hallmark Holiday(tm) between Hallowe&#8217;en and Christmas. As   it stands, we now have a two-month Christmas season. Don&#8217;t fool yourselves,   folks &#8212; Christmas won&#8217;t end until almost New Year&#8217;s. Although at least   this year, the Ol&#8217; Ball Drop will have a little more significance than   usual &#8230; assuming the lights don&#8217;t go out.<br />
At any rate, Christmas arrived in the malls November 1. Yick. Allison   and I can&#8217;t go for walks without seeing Christmas lights everywhere. It&#8217;s   actually sickening. We were flabbergasted that lights were appearing shortly   after Hallowe&#8217;en (at least give us a couple weeks, eh?) &#8212; then we saw   the Christmas tree in the neighbouring apartment building.<br />
Then, of course, there are the commercials. Endless festive, Prozac-infused   spots urging us to run up those credit card bills to buy gifts for those   millions of people on our gift-giving lists. I haven&#8217;t even got to the   Christmas cards yet!<br />
So why all the bitterness? I had to do my Christmas shopping this weekend.   It&#8217;s a new record for me &#8212; I have *never* shopped this early. It&#8217;s not   really relaxing &#8230; there&#8217;s still all the stress of wading through all   the junk to find that special something for those special people I won&#8217;t   see this year.<br />
You see, I&#8217;m not going to Ontario for Christmas this year. I&#8217;m staying   here. Last year, Allison spent a Sowrey Christmas. This year, it&#8217;s my turn   to experience a Collins Christmas. I&#8217;m looking forward to it &#8230; if I can   get through all the sales first.<br />
It started on Saturday. Allison and I darted out to Pacific Centre Mall   to see what things were available for our hard-earned dollars. It&#8217;s not   a great mall, especially since Eaton&#8217;s closed. (I have to say, it&#8217;s a   sad, disturbing feeling to look through the glass doors at the now-empty,   once-proud anchor of Canadian commerce.)<br />
The Saturday run was mostly to see what was available, although we did   find an excellent selection for one part of my family (sorry folks, no   hints). We spotted two other good possibilities, but the mall closed before   we could act on those impulses.<br />
It was then off to our evening entertainment. We had to activities to   choose from: See Kevin Smith&#8217;s new celluloid tour-de-force, Dogma, or   see a local band. The band went on at 10:00pm, which coincidentally was   the same time the movie started. We opted for trying to get in to see   the band, and then seeing the movie if all else failed.<br />
We arrived to find very few scalpers (one of whom was disguised as someone   looking for tickets, as not to give away his shadier motives). Initial   prices were $40. We went for dinner. When we returned, the ticket prices   had jumped to $50. We went into a nearby bookstore. When we came back,   the prices had returned to $40. We were aiming for $30.<br />
It&#8217;s a tricky game, dealing with scalpers. Most of them aren&#8217;t terribly   bright, nor are they patient. Having been through the University of Waterloo,   patience is something I have in abundance. Despite the chilly weather   (and me without my jacket) and the rain, neither Allison or I were willing   to budge on the price.<br />
The tickets were originally $22.50. A scalping company, known as Ticketmaster,   added an additional $5 to the price. We were being nice by offering a   profit of $2.50 per ticket. And when the rain started to fall heavily,   the scalpers agreed. $30 apiece. No movie for us&#8230;<br />
We had tickets to enter a Vancouver legend &#8212; the Fabulous Commodore   Ballroom. This was, until a few years ago, the best place to see any live   music performance. Then it closed down, and Vancouver was cursed with   having no venue for good bands. Then the House of Blues came in with a   bucket of money. Earlier this year, the doors swung open again.<br />
Wow.<br />
It&#8217;s a venue like no other. Art deco stylings &#8212; very 1930&#8217;s. The room   is huge &#8212; easily the size of an Olympic-size hockey rink &#8230; squared.   And then there&#8217;s the floor&#8230;<br />
Rumour had it that the original floor had something like 12 feet of horse   hair under it for springiness. Apparently, it was wood rot (they found   this during renovation). The new floor is in much better shape &#8230; but   just as springy. I&#8217;m not kidding, either &#8212; you can literally be knocked   from your feet in a mosh pit if you bounce out of beat with the rest of   the crowd. The vibration can be felt in the entire room. If an earthquake   were to hit, you&#8217;d probably never know.<br />
Allison and I stole up to the front of the dance floor, taking positions   roughly in the middle of the barricade between the crowd and the stage.   Front row seating, or rather, standing.<br />
The first band was from Toronto, the name of which I now forget. They   were good. Obviously, not good enough for me to remember their name, but   still good.<br />
By the time the featured act took the stage, Allison and I were trapped   against the barricade, desperately trying to hold our position against   all the people trying to force us out. But we held &#8230; it was the best   place to get a close look at Spirit of the West.<br />
We stayed up at the front for four songs &#8230; until some crowd-surfing   moron landed on Allison&#8217;s head. We took a hasty exit before one of us got   seriously injured. (John Mann, lead singer for SotW, later threatened   to refund crowd-surfer&#8217;s tickets and eject them from the premises for   making his &#8220;guests&#8221; leave the front &#8212; he was referring to us and a few   others.)<br />
Four words: &#8220;Home For A Rest&#8221;.<br />
This is perhaps one of SotW&#8217;s most popular songs (after &#8220;Save This House&#8221;).   You could barely hear John over the audience. *Everyone* was singing.   (The only concert experience that beat this was listening to 40,000 of   my closest friends singing along to The Tragically Hip.)<br />
About a dozen songs, a spirited rendition of &#8220;I Got You, Babe&#8221; and two   encores later, Allison and I ducked out before the tide crushed us.<br />
I resumed shopping the next day, considerably less bitter than the day   before. This was a chance for me to rush around and get the bulk of my   family shopping complete. I have to ship the stuff sometime this week,   if I&#8217;m not mistaken. Aside from a hefty batch of Cheezies (don&#8217;t worry   Mom, I haven&#8217;t forgotten this time), I&#8217;m done.<br />
So I&#8217;m a little less testy about the whole Christmas thing now. Maybe   it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve got part of my shopping done. Either that, or I just   haven&#8217;t noticed the 5,000,000 lights erected since last night&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate moving.<br />
I mean, I <em>really</em> hate moving.<br />
As you know, we moved to a new apartment yesterday. Based on the amount of time that it took to move Brian and Gill from their apartment to their house, I assumed (rather stupidly, it seems) that the trip would take about five hours.<br />
We started about 8pm the night before. Allison&#8217;s parents (who graciously wasted two days of their vacation helping us move) arrived and began to help us finish packing. We&#8217;d been packing for nearly two weeks, but due to all the other things we had to deal with we simply didn&#8217;t get everything done.<br />
The next morning, the packing resumed on the remaining small things. At about 11:45am, I headed out to get the truck. We rented a 17-foot cube van, which I thought would be ample to the task of moving our stuff. That was mistake #1.<br />
Traffic was a nightmare. My dear, close friend Murphy was following me everywhere. The rainy season had started in the Lower Mainland, of course on the day we had to move. The lights were out at Nanaimo and Kingsway, backing traffic up for blocks in both directions. I just knew it was going to be a rough day. If only I had known how rough.<br />
Returning to the apartment with the truck, we proceeded to load our lives&#8217; possessions into the truck. I was extremely grateful for the Collins&#8217; help &#8212; we never would have been able to move on our own. Because we were moving on a weekday, we were also unable to get friends to help &#8212; they were all at work.<br />
The idea had been to load the truck by 2:00, get down to the new apartment by 2:30, and have the truck back by 5:30.<br />
That was the idea.<br />
In reality, we had the *first* load ready by 3:00, we were unloaded by 4:15, and back to the old apartment to pick up the *second* load. Fortunately, we&#8217;d lucked out by having Michelle and Tyler (two friends of ours) leave work early to help us move. We stole Tyler going back to the old apartment.<br />
The second load was ready somewhere in the neighbourhood of about 8:00pm, give or take a half-hour. (By that point, it really didn&#8217;t matter any more.) We were unloaded by somewhere around 9:45. After that, I took the truck back, picked up my car, and drove to my new home.<br />
10 hours. It took 10 hours to get it all done. Note to self: Remember this the next time we get the silly idea that we can live someplace better.<br />
As it stands, the apartment is a disaster. There&#8217;s stuff everywhere. It&#8217;s gonna take us about a week to sort it all out.<br />
Like I said, I hate moving.<br />
Next time, we&#8217;re getting professional movers.<br />
And of course, there&#8217;s the aftermath. Rogers botched our @Home installation (we&#8217;re about 1 second away from getting ASDL to compensate for their incompetence). We still have to clean out our old apartment and turn in the keys.<br />
Overall, this isn&#8217;t an experience I want to relive for quite some time. So for the foreseeable future, here&#8217;s where you can reach us:<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The alarm went off at 8:00, and I staggered out of bed. Chris and I had made tentative plans to go for breakfast, but I needed to call him and find out. Chris couldn&#8217;t make it. The whole week had been like that &#8212; we&#8217;d been trying to get together, but one thing after another prevented our reunion.<br />
I returned to bed.<br />
I ran a few errands that morning, leaving Allison in Oakville. The errands took longer than I originally planned, putting me back on time. But I made sure to stop into Canadian Computer on Speers. I wanted to see Chris, even if for only five minutes.<br />
Two years ago, Chris was a computer novice. He hated the things. (Especially the 286 he used for most of his work.) Now he frightens me. I&#8217;m amazed at all the things he&#8217;s learned in the PAST YEAR. Now he&#8217;s an expert. And that meant he was busy.<br />
I got to talk with Chris for all of about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, he was help customers and answering phones. (One of the customers was a teacher from my high school, Suzi Beber, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen since I graduated.)<br />
Then it was over. Realising I had to go home, I bade Chris farewell, and headed home. All the way, I felt fairly numb. I had a huge list of people I&#8217;d wanted to visit with. Most of them didn&#8217;t even get a phone call. (Some people think I have too many friends.) It was too late, though. I couldn&#8217;t do anything more. I saw a few people, chatted with a few more. But it was over too soon. Too fast.<br />
We arrived at the airport about an hour ahead of time. I prefer half an hour for domestic flights, but Allison pointed out that we usually get rushed. I said goodbye to my dad, hugged my sister (my mom didn&#8217;t want to come &#8212; she hates goodbyes &#8212; so I hugged her before we left Oakville), and headed into Terminal 3.<br />
We arrived in Vancouver around 7:30pm PDT following a rather eventless flight. (Not that I&#8217;m looking for an eventful flight.) We grabbed our bags, hopped the Park N&#8217; Fly shuttle, and went to pick up the car.<br />
The car&#8217;s battery was dead. I don&#8217;t know how the heck they got the car there, short of pushing it. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have noted that.<br />
Morons.<br />
As we drove home (after getting the car jumped), I remarked on something I hadn&#8217;t noticed before. I felt like I was home. For the first time since I moved here, I felt like I was at home. It was a strange feeling. For the longest time, I didn&#8217;t think I could ever feel at home here. But I do, to some degree at least.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still miss my family and friends. I always will &#8212; you&#8217;re all a huge part of my life. I can&#8217;t forget you any more than I can sever an arm and not notice.<br />
But I was home. I collapsed in our couch, and felt like I was at home. A strange feeling, indeed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Old Man was still cursing the sink the following morning. By the time Allison and I left for Waterloo, the plumber had arrived to solve the problem once and for all. (It would take an additional two hours, and several holes drilled in the wall to finally eradicate the clog.)<br />
The drive up to Waterloo was very pleasant &#8212; it was a beautiful day. I wanted to show Allison where I went to school. The memories were flooding back even before I turned onto Highway 86. By the time I turned onto Ring Road, I was getting some serious deja vu.<br />
But the campus seemed foreign. The students looked much younger (did I ever look that young?), more naive. The university seemed no different than I remembered, with the exception of modifications to South Campus Hall.<br />
After a quick driving tour of the campus, we started the walking tour. This took us from South Campus Hall, between the science buildings, through Math and Computer (I was disappointed to see the Red Room is no longer visible), through Davis Center, back to the Campus Centre (aka the Student Life Centre), over to Needless Hell (aka Needles Hall), through Hagey Hall, and then back to South Campus Hall.<br />
It felt strange walking around. I felt old. Allison commented that an entire (three-year) class had entered and graduated since I left. It&#8217;s a strange feeling, walking around, not seeing any familiar faces.<br />
We left U(W), and drove around Uptown Waterloo, then Downtown Kitchener. We stopped for a while to take advantage of the Oktoberfest that was underway, picking up a pair of rather flavourless sausages.<br />
It&#8217;s kind of ironic that in the five years I was in Waterloo (four years of which I was actually there for Oktoberfest), I only went ONCE to the festivities. (This was prior to my decision to start drinking alcohol, so needless to say I didn&#8217;t have that much fun.) Okay, that&#8217;s not the ironic part. Here&#8217;s the irony: As we headed back to the car, we were approached by a pair of (American?) tourists who were looking for more &#8220;fun&#8221; attractions. They asked this of a guy, who although spent four years in Waterloo during Oktoberfest, had not lived there for over three years. I directed them to the Hans Haas (aka the Information booth).<br />
We headed up to Highway 7 on our trip out to Guelph. Within minutes, we were leaving Kitchener/Waterloo heading east. I had to admit, I almost didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; there are many memories for me there, and several people I would have liked to visit with. But there wasn&#8217;t time. There&#8217;s never enough time.<br />
We drove around Guelph, during which I attempted to give Allison a rough tour of the area. I don&#8217;t know Guelph as well as my friends who went to Guelph (or spent a lot of time in the city), but I&#8217;d been there enough times that I knew the area.<br />
Our first stop was at McCrae House. Well, after we drove around a bit before we found it (we took a wrong turn and ended up on the wrong side of the Speed River). McCrae House is the birthplace of John McCrae, author of &#8220;In Flanders Fields&#8221;. We appeared 45 minutes late to go in the museum, unfortunately.<br />
The tour continued up the sidestreets around McCrae House, where Allison oohed and aahed at the beauty of the leaf-covered streets and all the red brick houses. If it weren&#8217;t for the distance, the winters, and the dryness, I figure I could get Allison to move there.<br />
Then it was past the &#8216;X&#8217; House (the &#8216;X&#8217;s are still visible in the window, by the way) on Gordon St. before turning into the University of Guelph. The tour here was fair short, as our time was continuing be tight. We had to be in Acton by 6:30, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how long that would take.<br />
Again, memories. Pangs of regret. The invisible tears of missed friends. They say that smell is the strongest sense that can evoke a memory &#8212; I often find that sight works just as well.<br />
Returning to Highway 7, we continued on our way east. We stopped briefly on the edge of Guelph to get something to drink. I hopped into the convenience store, and purchased a ginger ale for Allison, and a Sprite for me. Well, it was going to be a Sprite until I spied my favourite drink &#8230; Wink. You can&#8217;t get Wink in BC (mind you, you can&#8217;t get Cheezies in Ontario). I took the bottles and presented them to the clerk. I was $0.20 short. I was about to pull the Wink back, resigning myself to never having a visit with an old friend. The clerk, however, said I could pay him back later.<br />
Oh. Okay. Sure. No problem.<br />
Sucker.<br />
We arrived in Acton shortly after 6:00, far too early to arrive at our destination. We were going to Jason and Steph&#8217;s place in north Acton (aka the middle of nowhere) to have dinner with our hosts and two more of my friends, Brian and Gill. Allison had met Brian and Gill before, but I couldn&#8217;t remember if she had met Jason or Steph before. My guess was &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />
Because we were early, I thought we&#8217;d check out downtown Acton. After laughing hysterically about the phrase &#8220;It&#8217;s worth the drive to Acton&#8221;, we decided to visit the company that inspired that phrase &#8212; the Olde Hyde House.<br />
Holy leather, Batman!<br />
I&#8217;ve been in a lot of stores, but I&#8217;ve never seen that much leather before. Ever. We wandered about the store, just to see what they had. Most of it was nice, and I debated off and on about picking out Allison&#8217;s birthday present (she&#8217;s always wanted a leather jacket). Nothing really struck me as &#8220;I gotta get her that!&#8221;. (Sorry, honey, no jacket this year.)<br />
We followed the directions Brian gave me and actually managed to find Chateau Fournier. It wasn&#8217;t long before (most of) the gang was assembled. Jason and Steph treated us to a steak dinner (Jason&#8217;s mom sacrificed her fingers for our meal, accidentally slicing off part of her index finger and thumb on a vicious man(woman)-eating slicer).<br />
Then it was a game of croquano (crocano, krokano &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how the heck you spell it), a game that you could almost call circular curling. If you play it with Brian, it&#8217;s &#8220;kill your opponent&#8221;. Mind you, I&#8217;m not much different&#8230;<br />
It was hard leaving. The memory thing, y&#8217;know. The last time I&#8217;d seen Jason was at his stag; for Steph, it was camping a couple of years ago. I didn&#8217;t know when I would see either Brian or Gill again. It&#8217;s a little sobering when you realise that you have to leave your friends again. You&#8217;d think that after a while, it would stop hurting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The original plan that day was to go into Toronto. Allison was feeling better, and she wanted to see the various neighbourhoods of Toronto she had heard so much about. That was the original plan, and plans around the Sowrey homestead tend to change without warning.<br />
That morning, it was because of simple request: &#8220;Geoff, can you help me move the chest downstairs?&#8221;<br />
The dishwasher had overflowed and leaked into the basement, leaking onto a chest. Why had the dishwasher overflowed? A plug in the line. Take three guesses what we didn&#8217;t do that day.<br />
We tried Drano. To no avail. We tried a plunger. To no avail. We tried more Drano. To no avail. We tried draining the trap, running a short line to clean out whatever the problem was, filling it up with Drano, and then plunging it. To no avail.<br />
My dad returned with a bottle of sulphuric acid. The reaction between the sulphuric acid and the Drano was pungent, chasing everyone from the kitchen. It did nothing. After my father disappeared to go to his job, I went up to the load hardware store and returned with a drain snake. Even shoving 15 feet of this into the drain did nothing.<br />
Allison suffered the entire time. She wanted to go to Toronto. Instead, she was effectively banished to the basement, and surfed the Internet. All day. For about four hours, I did nothing but try and clear this wretched clog. To no avail.<br />
Dinner that evening was at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s, where I (under the supervision of the master chef Allison) made Indian curry. Mmmmm, tasty. We spent several hours there, making dinner, eating dinner, and talking the entire time. It was kind of weird, when I thought about all the things that had changed since I left for BC two years ago. Cathy had not only left home, but now had a home of her own. Her own kitchen, her own living room, her own yard.<br />
Returning home, we found my father had effectively dissected the kitchen drain. A collective 12 litres of Drano and sulphuric acid had done nothing to the clog &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. Of course, that didn&#8217;t mean that my dad wasn&#8217;t finished. Craig&#8217;s snake went in to try and flush out the problem.<br />
I guess you really had to be there. My old man, sitting on a short stool, hanging onto a short metal rod attached to the snake. He reeled it in, he forced it back. It was like watching a dramatisation of &#8220;Old Man and the Sea&#8221;, although I&#8217;d reword it &#8212; &#8220;Old Man and the Sink&#8221;.<br />
No amount of blowing, sucking, forcing, snaking, or flushing could do anything. At 1:30am, more than 12 hours after this fiasco started, I went to bed.</p>
