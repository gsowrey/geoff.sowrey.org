	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If I were to summarise the last ten years of my career prior, specifically from about June 2000 to June 2010, it would look something like this: web developer, specialised web developer, senior web developer, junior manager, manager, director, technical architect. What, in many ways, looks largely like an &#8220;upward&#8221; progression in knowledge work.<br />
During these last ten years, and notably the latter five, I trended more and more away from programming and more into management. I managed people, I managed projects, I managed implementations, and pretty much managed to avoid coding of any kind. I convinced myself that it made more sense for me to focus on the higher-level technology planning than it did on the actual implementation &#8212; there were others who did it better than me, and it was a waste of effort to try do it all.<br />
And suddenly, I found myself checkmated.<br />
<span id="more-2775"></span>In June, it became painfully clear that my role as a technical architect was going to run out, and soon. (I ended up taking all of August off &#8212; partly because I&#8217;d planned to do so many, many months ago, but also because work for my role had run out.) And despite looking around, there just didn&#8217;t seem to be a demand for mid-level technology managers with an emphasis on internet applications. I&#8217;d managed to &#8212; quite literally &#8212; position myself out of a career.<br />
My father ran into something like this himself, after his company rather callously raped him of his respect after a great many years of service and profit. He, had risen from a junior employee to a manager after many years (even running an entire division of the company), and his fall was painful. He was 50 at the time, and starting out new again ain&#8217;t easy. After the shock wore off, however, my father strived to reinvent himself, doing what he did best: sell. He went from construction equipment to selling oil-absorbing peat moss (in effect, going green long before it was common knowledge, let alone trendy).<br />
I now face a similar need to reinvent. I&#8217;m only 38, so it should be easier, right? (Right?) But I have a problem. Unlike my dad, I&#8217;m not a specialist anymore. I was, about ten years ago, but I&#8217;ve since become a generalist &#8212; in both the best and worst cases. I know a lot about my industry, but in most cases I don&#8217;t know quite enough to be truly useful in specific situations. And add to that, my specialist skills have rusted. They&#8217;re out-of-date, and some of my knowledge includes developing for now-unsupported platforms.<br />
The newer libraries are unknown to me, and I&#8217;ve never been particularly good with object-oriented programming (the OOP style was not harped on when I was in school, so I&#8217;m a functional programmer). But today&#8217;s environments require me to know how to use these tools. The guys I work with can make them sing and dance, and I feel as if I&#8217;m lucky to get them to just stand up.<br />
I still plan to use my management years for their wealth of experience &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot to be said for the things you learn while trying to make sure everyone else has an easier time fo their job. Those skills, however, don&#8217;t offer me a current job as a manager. Going back to my older skills is proving quite a challenge. I gotta tell you, it&#8217;s been like watching someone restore a rusted engine, and try to get it to turn over for the first time.<br />
I also can&#8217;t help but see the irony that the very same interview questionnaire that I helped write over a decade would now exclude me from being hired.  I almost feel like that guy you&#8217;ve hear about, laid off from a job he had for 30 years, whose industry has waned, having to do something totally different now.<br />
Make no mistake, I am <em>retraining</em> &#8212; relearning something I knew how to do (and do well), to keep my skills strong enough to keep me employed. Unlike formal programs, I have to do this on my own, without a teacher. I have only the contacts I&#8217;ve made over a decade as assistance, and more RSS feeds and Twitter accounts than I care to think about. Ultimately, I have to rely on my aged brain to do things it used to find trivial, and now finds difficult.<br />
It&#8217;s stressful. I feel like I&#8217;m having to learn to walk again. I&#8217;ve had to do the simple projects, to re-master the basics. (You gotta walk before you can run.) I&#8217;ve spent many late nights reading all forms of documentation and standards, and in particular, I&#8217;ve been reading Drupal documentation voraciously (helped in part by my much-stronger colleague Brian) &#8212; the concept of a CMS I understand; it&#8217;s the implementation I need to know. It&#8217;s also learning deeper PHP (and PHP frameworks), jQuery, more complex SQL, and learning the newer tricks found in HTML 5, and CSS 3. If I had the time, I might even try my hand at ActionScript. But I already feel overwhelmed. There&#8217;s just not enough time in a day.<br />
It&#8217;s a different mindset, too, and refocusing it onto code has been a challenge. I find myself planning out implementation strategies, and not focusing on the current need. I try to do a simple implementation, and I&#8217;m soon debating whether I should build an XML parser, or go straight to a simple CMS build to side-step some of the issues. I&#8217;ve had to rely on friends to help fix implementations, only to see the fix and slap myself in the forehead for not thinking of it myself.<br />
It&#8217;s coming, though. Every day makes greater strides, and working under others with deeper experience is helping rebuild the skills I had feared lost. It will take time. But I&#8217;m strong. And I will survive.</p>
