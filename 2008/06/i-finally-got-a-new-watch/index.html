		<p>[[I need a new watch|I had said I wanted a Rolex]]. I still do, really. I love the GMT Master II, the Submariner, and the Milgauss. But here&#8217;s the sad reality: I can&#8217;t afford one. I tried. I really did, but the finances weren&#8217;t working in my favour. (It&#8217;s hard to justify the high price when you have a small child, and we&#8217;re far from &#8220;rolling in it&#8221;.)<br />
My major problem was that I still wanted an automatic movement &#8212; no quartz. And I really like the Rolex style &#8212; it&#8217;s not just iconic, it set the mould for watches around the world. Within my price range, there weren&#8217;t a lot of ones available that I actually liked. Most were atrocious, gaudy, tacky, or just downright ugly. Or quartz.<br />
My co-worker Matt turned me onto something I hadn&#8217;t previously considered: <a href="http://www.invictawatch.com/">Invicta</a>.<br />
<span id="more-981"></span>Invicta is a bit of a weird company. They were originally Swiss, before being bought up by some Florida-based investment firm. They don&#8217;t really seem to have retail stores, either, which naturally brings up the question of authenticity. Among other things. And when you purchase from a place called the &#8220;Discount Watch Store&#8221;, you really have to wonder if what you&#8217;re getting is gonna be good or not.<br />
(For the record, I do recommend <a href="http://www.discountwatchstore.com/">DiscountWatchStore.com</a> as a place to purchase. While their &#8220;free sizing&#8221; chart seems to be about 1/4&#8243; off, the prices are right, delivery is fast, and they deliver what they promise.)<br />
It also doesn&#8217;t help that Invicta is, for all intents and purposes, a bit of a knock-off company. Their catalog is filled with watches that look eerily familiar, like you&#8217;ve seen them somewhere before. <a href="http://www.rolex.com/">Rolex</a> isn&#8217;t the only one with identifiable models, <a href="http://www.bellross.com/">Bell &amp; Ross</a> has a line that appears amongst Invicta&#8217;s lineup as well.<br />
So I did a bit of reading. A lot of reading, really. Invicta, despite the fact their designs tend to be oddly familiar with other watches, actually has some decent products. There are even collectors who make some of the models darn hard to get.<br />
I fell in love with the Pro Diver 4469. I liked it. Black face, stainless steel bracelet, automatic movement, sapphire crystal, screw-down crown, watertight to 300 metres, and date display. And the movement is Swiss &#8212; it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.sellita.ch/">Sellita</a> SW 200, which is based on the well-worn <a href="http://www.eta.ch/">ETA</a> 2824-2, which powers watches that cost many times as much as the 4469. I was already to snap it up &#8230; when I found out that they were all back ordered.<br />
Nurtz.<br />
But then I saw the 4468. Almost exactly the same, but with a &#8220;white&#8221; face (think brushed steel). And after a few minutes, I really liked it.<br />
So I bought it.<br />
Took a few days to show up, and figures that it would arrive while I was in Costa Rica, but it now adorns my wrist and I&#8217;m pretty darn happy about it. Let me give you a tour&#8230;<br />
First, the box. The watch is inside. This is my first view of my new watch.<br />
[flickr]photo:2543355791(small)[/flickr]<br />
Lid&#8217;s off, and this is what I first see: the front flap opens, and I see some documentation on top.<br />
[flickr]photo:2544186232(small)[/flickr]<br />
Documentation removed. So far, I gotta give these guys credit. That can&#8217;t be that cheap of a box to make.<br />
[flickr]photo:2544188854(small)[/flickr]<br />
The box, more clearly shown. Given, yellow isn&#8217;t my favourite colour, but I can&#8217;t really complain.<br />
[flickr]photo:2543362611(small)[/flickr]<br />
I get my first glimpse of the watch. I&#8217;m now very excited.<br />
[flickr]photo:2543364113(small)[/flickr]<br />
Closer view.<br />
[flickr]photo:2544193956(small)[/flickr]<br />
Really close view. I really want to take it out of the box now.<br />
[flickr]photo:2544195370(small)[/flickr]<br />
Out of the box and on its side. The watch is ticking, probably as a result of me jostling it. Proves that it&#8217;s a mechanical!<br />
[flickr]photo:2544196548(small)[/flickr]<br />
The clasp and bracelet. Note the protective plastic still in place!<br />
[flickr]photo:2544197474(small)[/flickr]<br />
Okay, now we get into the artistic. The caseback is sapphire, so you can see the movement inside. Too bad the movement is pretty plain. I prefer a more artistic look, but I can&#8217;t afford that. Also note that &#8220;Invicta&#8221; is embossed on all the bracelet links.<br />
[flickr]photo:2543372213(small)[/flickr]<br />
This is the only part of the watch I don&#8217;t really like. Etching &#8220;Invicta&#8221; on the side is really silly. This is where Rolex really has it nailed down. But I can&#8217;t afford one of those.<br />
[flickr]photo:2544203028(small)[/flickr]<br />
Side-on for the crown. There&#8217;s even a little &#8220;+&#8221; on the end of the crown, a nod to Invicta&#8217;s Swiss origins.<br />
[flickr]photo:2543377937(small)[/flickr]<br />
Plastic&#8217;s off, and I&#8217;m about to put the sucker on. It does feel nice, I have to say. Need a link taken out, but once that&#8217;s done, it should fit like a glove.<br />

					<p>The company should thank you for your endorsement, after seeing their web site I normally would of closed my browser and ran for the hills about 0.3 seconds into he experience. I don&#8217;t think they missed a colour in the background, and the music, ouch, turn your speakers down before visiting the site, better yet, turn them off.</p>

					<p>I have to agree with you. I&#8217;ve got a number of issues with their website, especially with the inability to find anyone who sells Invicta. It&#8217;s not really browse-friendly, so it&#8217;s hard to see anything, too. Personally, I&#8217;d love to redesign the site. Side project, of course. 😉</p>

					<p>I am very impressed with Invicta style and quilaty.  They offer well-made watches at a very competitive price. I own seven Invicta watches and love each of them.  They have the look and feel of a much more expensive watch.This particular model looks almost identical to a Rolex Submariner.  It is an automatic watch (if you don&#8217;t wear it for around 24 hours or move around enough, the time must be reset) with 21 jewel Japanese movement and has a see through back that lets you view the automatic movement. The watch has a large 43mm face and it has Mercedes style hands and Tritnite luminescence markings with a magnified date marker.  It is water resistant to 200 meters (just in case any of you will go down that far).The one pictured above has an oyster-like bezel (Omega style).  The older (Series 1 or S1) model of the 8926 have a coin edge bezel like the Rolex Submariner.  The bezel rotates.  Invicta makes really attractive bands that have a nice weight. The stainless steel silver band and black face combination is very sharp and will never go out of style.  I have an 8.5  wrist and the watch accommodates my wrist with room to spare.  They come in the trademark yellow Invicta box with an Invicta pillow.The 9937 is an upgraded model of this watch that offers 25 jewel Swiss movement instead of the Japanese 21 jewel movement, a sapphire crystal, an improved stainless steel band (even though the one on the 8926 is great), solid end pieces, a better magnifier over the date, a flip lock safety clasp and a large rosewood box instead of the yellow box that comes with this 8926.</p>
