	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember kids music when I was young. A lot of it was Disney (or published by Disney), available on vinyl 45s that we played on our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-Fh6AiMyDM">Mickey Mouse record player</a> &#8212; you remember, the one where Mickey&#8217;s arm is the arm for playing the record, and his forefinger contained the stylus?  <br />
You <em>don&#8217;t</em> remember&#8230; You don&#8217;t even know what a 45 is?  Frick, I&#8217;m getting too old for this.  <br />
<span id="more-1090"></span>Well, back when I was a kid, it was a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burl_Ives">Burl Ives</a>, singing bears, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffi_(musician)">Raffi</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon,_Lois_&amp;_Bram">Sharon, Lois, and Bram</a>. I never really liked those songs much, admittedly. Well, maybe except for Burl Ives &#8212; how can you not love that voice?  <br />
Anyway, I never really liked them because I always felt like I was being patronised. Like some adult was patting me on the head and saying: &#8220;There, there, little boy. We&#8217;ll sing you a nice song to make you happy.&#8221; Well, screw you, Raffi, I don&#8217;t want to listen to your happy song about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_the_Bay">flipping bays where watermelons grow</a>. I know damn well what my mother will say, and it&#8217;s nothing about polka-dotted whale tales. I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s even ever seen a whale, polka-dotted or not!<br />
(For the record, I have nothing but the highest respect for Raffi and the work he has done not just in music, but in child advocacy. I just can&#8217;t listen to his music.)<br />
It&#8217;s stuck with me all my life. To this day, I still can&#8217;t listen to most kids&#8217; music. And I really can&#8217;t stand the &#8220;<a href="http://www.scoutsongs.com/lyrics/purplestew.html">Purple Stew</a>&#8221; song. Man, I <em>hated </em>that song when it was sung in school. I spent years &#8212; <strong>YEARS </strong>&#8212; skooching to the corner so no-one would pick me to end up in that damned purple stew. Unlike my other apparently-ignorant classmates, I knew what the stew was for, and I wasn&#8217;t keen on being eaten!  <br />
So naturally, now that I&#8217;m a parent, I&#8217;m worried. I don&#8217;t want to have to listen to kids&#8217; music, the kind that has turned several of my friends insane because their kids want to listen to the same song a million times. If the song isn&#8217;t any good to begin with, you&#8217;re ready to commit sepuku. I&#8217;ve seen the blank stares on their faces, reminicent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie">early-stages of zombification</a>. I like music &#8212; no, I need music! Good music! Without music, there is no hope, no future, no salvation, nothing to carry me through a hard day!  <br />
Luckily, now being at an age where I can appreciate things more for what they are, I&#8217;ve managed to discover a few things.  <br />
First, not everyone writes crappy kids&#8217; music. Witness <a href="http://www.sesamestreet.org/">Sesame Street</a> and <a href="http://muppets.go.com">The Muppets</a>. Jim Henson was more than a visionary when it came to children&#8217;s programming, he (or whomever did the music direction) totally hit the nail on the head when it came to the songs: Make songs that kids like to sing, that parents won&#8217;t yak at.<br />
&lt;rant&gt;<br />
Remember, folks, good parents listen and watch every thing their kid hears and sees (be it music or TV). Parents who plunk their kid in front of a TV, go off to do something else and then <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;rlz=1C1GGLS_enCR291&amp;q=parent+group+complain+television">bitch about what their kids are watching</a> are <strong>BAD PARENTS</strong>. You&#8217;re being stupid. And yes, I&#8217;m a parent now, so I can say that with a certain amount of certainty. If you&#8217;re not willing to take an interest in your child&#8217;s activities, you&#8217;re not parenting. Just sayin&#8217;.<br />
&lt;/rant&gt;<br />
Anyhoo&#8230;<br />
A few people have figured out to make decent kids&#8217; music. I can listen to The Muppets (even the oft-maligned &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwSFSkJvwZ4">Mah Na Mah Na</a>&#8220;) until my ears bleed, and I don&#8217;t go crazy. That&#8217;s important.  <br />
A couple of months ago, I found out I wasn&#8217;t alone. It seemed that someone else had that idea. They created an album called &#8220;<a href="http://www.musicforthekids.com/">For the Kids</a>&#8220;, which took a lot of the songs you knew as a kid, and had them played by people you listen to now. Examples: &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfCq1fqarJE">La La La La Lemon</a>&#8221; by the Barenaked Ladies, &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSFLZ-MzIhM">The Rainbow Connection</a>&#8221; by Sarah McLachlan, &#8220;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&#8221; by Chantal Kreviazuk, and even Tom Waits appears on the album.  But admittedly, even though Sarah McLachlan does a wonderful rendition, I will always hear Kermit the Frog sing &#8220;The Rainbow Connection&#8221;.  <br />
I wonder if the experience of recording &#8220;La La La La Lemon&#8221; inspired the <a href="http://www.bnlmusic.com/default2.asp">Barenaked Ladies</a>, &#8216;cuz earlier this year they released their latest album &#8212; of kids&#8217; music. &#8220;<a href="http://www.bnlmusic.com/snacktime/">Snacktime</a>&#8221; was a total surprise to me, though after listening to it a couple of times, it really makes sense. I mean, these guys are all late-30s children, for crying out loud. As a parent, I don&#8217;t just mind listening to it &#8212; I sing along to it (albeit very badly).  <br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Longs-Lullabies-Curious-George-Johnson/dp/B000CR7RDE">Jack Johnston pumped out the soundtrack to Curious George</a>, which is fantastic! (Still need to pick that one up.) And several other compliation albums with good, listenable music are now <span style="text-decoration: line-through">freely</span> readily available (see the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kids-Too-Various-Artists/dp/B0003JANQE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-7732828-5102460?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1190337394&amp;sr=1-1#purchase">Also Bought section in For The Kids Too</a>).<br />
So, parents out there suffering to annoying music, there is hope! Turn away the garbage, and pull out some new stuff. Sing with your kids because it&#8217;s not annoying! Once you get them interested in (better) music, you can slowly amp them up to more popular music.<br />
And eventually, they&#8217;ll be screaming the lyrics to &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v69yX3qZUZQ">Aces High</a>&#8220;. (Just don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you&#8230;)</p>

					<p>Thanks, Sis! We&#8217;ll have to check those out!<br />
As for the &#8220;bad parents&#8221;, I leave that title to the wankers who want to complain about what appears on TV, but don&#8217;t bother to spend time with their children watching it to see if it&#8217;s okay or not. Forcing their inequities onto others is not cool. It&#8217;s been a long-standing gripe of mine ever since some jackass started editing <em>Looney Tunes</em>.</p>

					<p>I also suggest They Might Be Giants&#8217; &#8220;Here come the ABCs&#8221;, &#8220;Here Come the 123s&#8221; and &#8220;No!&#8221;. I bought them for my nephew, but I purchased them myself before he was even born. Mind you, this is coming from someone who watched Sesame St. until he was 14.</p>

					<p>1) &#8216;Mah na mah na&#8217; was originally written for the soundtrack of a Swedish soft-core pornography film. Don&#8217;t ask me why I know this.<br />
2) I have managed to procure the .mp3s for a long-out-of-print Smurfs record (Smurfing Sing Song). I must have worn out countless record player needles listening to that one over and over as a child, and recently found them online. If you want &#8217;em, just lemme know.</p>
