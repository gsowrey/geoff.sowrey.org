		<p>The morning was cool, but not uncomfortable. Dhar had slept in the navigator&#8217;s chair again, but for once wasn&#8217;t awake before me. Not having relieved myself the night before, my bladder was now rather tight feeling, the call of nature was screaming in my eardrums. As quietly as possible, I climbed out of the van (possible only because Dhar wasn&#8217;t blocking the side doors) and hiked down to the KOA Office.<br />
The KOA office was a fairly large two-storey building. The front was the office itself, facing the road. At the back of the office were the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s washrooms and a pool (also closed for the season). I found this closure rather interesting considering the camp looked rather full, and the limited facilities were sure to cause problems.<br />
I first went to the washroom door to see if it was locked during the day. As I reached it, the door swung open and one of the other KOA guests left. I shoved my foot in the door and headed directly to the urinal. Feeling less pressured and bit lighter, I went around to the other side of the building to find the office.<br />
A husband and wife team ran the camp, the wife sounding like an immigrant from England. I politely asked for the washroom combination so the others could get in when they woke up. I explained that we had arrived during the night, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to use the facilities yet. (Which was essentially true.) The woman understood completely and provided me with the important information.<br />
By the time I got back the others were rising. It was shower time. I grabbed my things and headed off to cleanse myself of several hundred miles of grime. The showers were best described as &#8220;weird&#8221;: they had all the necessary fixtures, with cinder block dividers between the three stalls. No, that isn&#8217;t the strange part. Unlike all the other places we stopped, the dividers didn&#8217;t extend all the way to the wall, leaving a foot-wide gap and allowing one person to see into the adjacent stall.<br />
Hello? Who on earth would do something like that? More importantly, why?<br />
I took the middle stall (for no particular reason), and was joined on either side by Stefan and Dhar about five minutes later. All three of us joked about the rather odd construction of the showers. Cleaned and dried, I headed back to the van to carry out the rest of the morning&#8217;s duties. These included emptying and refilling the fresh water tanks (the newness of the plastic tended to lend a rather unpleasant taste), getting the seats back in their original positions, and buying more postcards to send home.<br />
Albuquerque isn&#8217;t exactly the garden spot of New Mexico, but it&#8217;s a nice place (I just wouldn&#8217;t want to live there). Trees and small plants gave some shade within the campgrounds (although not a tenth as nice as the campground in Las Vegas, but better than the ones in Colorado), amidst the wilting and dried out grass. But the grass next to the van would look nice within a week or so of us leaving, the additional water would help replenish the moisture.<br />
A knock at one of the doors announced the arrival of one of the KOA staff. He informed us that we moved during the night, to which I vehemently (but politely) insisted we hadn&#8217;t. After a brief explanation of what happened when we arrived, the middle-aged and overweight man apologized, suggesting that someone else had created some confusion, and went off to find out who.<br />
This was only the first encounter of less-than-average intelligence at that KOA that morning. I don&#8217;t know if it was just the staff, or if it was the result of living in New Mexico. Either way, there were some seriously intelligence impaired people working there.<br />
My next encounter was buying postcards. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so bad, but when I got around to buying stamps things went to hell in the proverbial hand-basket. Everywhere else we had been had required $0.40 to send a postcard to Canada. Yet for some reason the English woman insisted that the cost was $0.50. I assumed one of two things: 1) Because of Albuquerque&#8217;s remoteness, the cost was slightly higher, or 2) The cost had gone up in the past couple of days. I pretty much ruled out the second possibility, since Americans would have a fit over a 10 cent increase in postage. The first possibility wasn&#8217;t particular plausible either as far as I was concerned, but an extra $0.40 overall wasn&#8217;t going to destroy my budget.<br />
As it turns out, the stamps were supposed to cost $0.40, as Rebecca found out when she bought stamps about a half hour later. (The woman would later apologize for her mistake.) But I wasn&#8217;t the only one to have to deal with all the strange goings-on that morning. When Stefan went in to get the late check-in squared away, he also had to deal with what appeared to be a rash of moronic behaviour. Some of the aforementioned demeanor was the result of a guest leaving the campground and returning to a different spot, messing up all the scheduling and reservations, and pissing off a motorhome arriving for its reservation.<br />
Breakfast that morning was oranges and the last of our fruity loops (the equally as sugary Kellogg&#8217;s knock-off). Having four people crammed around the table in the back of the van was not a wise idea &#8212; there was hardly any elbow room, virtually no leg room, and if you had to get out you were pretty much screwed unless you were the last person in.<br />
We wasted little time, and pulled out just before 11:00. On directions from the KOA clerks (surprisingly accurate ones), we traveled north along Juan Tabo Boulevard to find the Valvoline lube shop, about a mile or so north of the I-40. Stefan&#8217;s keen eyesight picked it out at a fair distance, and soon enough we were parked around the back waiting our turn in line.<br />
There seemed to be a large number of people wanting to change their oil that morning. I had hoped for a simple drive-in, drive-out spending all of about 20 minutes. Unfortunately there were two cars ahead of us in both bays, meaning that at best we were there for at least 40 minutes. So we sat back, listened to the radio, and waited.<br />
One of the oil jockeys came out after a few minutes and had me fill out some information about the van. This necessitated a quick flip through the owner&#8217;s manual to make sure I got the information correct. Another jockey had an elderly man in a pickup truck and us switch sides to keep the order of first-come, first-serve in perfect shape.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca went off to find coffee and camera film. I needed film, and asked Dhar to grab some for me, and I&#8217;d pay him back later. To keep in check with the film I had used so far, I asked for Kodak film, preferably 400 ASA. I got my 400 ASA, but it was Fuji instead. I don&#8217;t mind Fuji film, but I&#8217;ve always believed Fuji film takes different pictures than Kodak film.<br />
Only moments following Rebecca and Dhar&#8217;s return to the van our turn came for an oil change. Guided by one of the half-dozen high school dropouts (or so their appearance seemed to be) that ran the place, although in a very professional manner, I drove the Behemoth into place over one of the massive oil changing pits. There seemed to be almost a military manner about the way business was carried out: precise motions, strong team dependence, and a curious habit of repeating yelled orders so that every employee was aware of what was going on even if that employee wasn&#8217;t directly involved.<br />
The hood was popped as the oil pan plug was pulled. If there is such a thing as an automotive enema, I&#8217;m certain the Behemoth received one. At first we were all in the van, but almost immediately Stefan and Dhar climbed out to watch the lube jockeys go through their steps.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960427.1175</strong><br />
<em>Day 7</em><br />
We hit Albuquerque late last night and actually managed to sleep in for a change &#8211; 8:45 to be specific. Three hours later, we&#8217;re now changing oil. After that, we&#8217;re getting abducted by aliens. We might get to San Antonio tonight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My father was very specific about the type of oil that was used in any of our family vehicles &#8212; always 15W40 grade. Neither Stefan or Dhar (acknowledged automotive fanatics) could understand it, neither did any of the lube jockeys. To be honest, I never did either. All I knew is that the oil my dad usually put in was made for diesel engines and was excellent at keeping the carbon levels low.<br />
But in the heat of the south, 15W40 is hardly ever used. The most popular grades were literally kept on tap &#8212; three gas pump-style hoses provided quick and easy access to refills. Our rather odd order had to be yelled down to the storage area (although yelled all over the garage at the same time, as if in disbelief that some yahoo was actually ordering such a thick oil), and five quart bottles had to be tossed up.<br />
Everything that moved was greased. Every fluid level was checked. The filters were changed. While we waited for the last of the bottles to be filled, one of the station&#8217;s employees struck up conversation (almost unavoidable when you&#8217;re driving a motorhome with Ontario license plates). Mostly where we had been and where we were going &#8212; standard fare for us by that point. Then he asked us who we thought was going to win the Stanley Cup that year.<br />
Although I immediately answered: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a clue!&#8221;, it took me only a moment to realize the irony of the situation. Here I was, a devout Canadian, from what many believe to be the true home of ice hockey, and I don&#8217;t follow what many would call our national pastime. (As a side note &#8212; hockey is so popular that the theme for CBC&#8217;s Hockey Night In Canada has been repeatedly recommended as our new national anthem, mostly because O Canada doesn&#8217;t sound good at hockey games.) I was in a state where the only ice they probably saw was floating in drinks, yet they eagerly watched hockey.<br />
I guess I&#8217;ve always had this odd objection to warm climates taking a liking to ice hockey. I have this peculiar train-of-thought that says places like Dallas, Miami, and Los Angeles should never be allowed to have a hockey team, especially when needy cold places like Quebec City are more deserving. In my opinion, any place that doesn&#8217;t see snow for more than two months of the year should not be allowed to have an ice hockey team. Yes, I know that proper conditions can easily be maintained in arenas, but that&#8217;s beside the point. It&#8217;s the principle of the matter. Ice is nice.<br />
Anyway, a few minutes later and a $25 charge to my VISA card, we hit the road to see if we could get abducted by aliens. Our major destination of the day was Roswell, about 200 miles south-east of Albuquerque.<br />
For those of you not familiar with the name Roswell, you probably don&#8217;t follow UFO lore. In 1947 newspaper headlines touted the crash of an unidentified flying object &#8212; the first, and most certainly not the last (though probably the most credible) report of any such incident from 1947 to the present day. Theories abound as to what happened. Some, like the US Army, contend that the object was a weather balloon. Others think it was one of the number &#8220;black projects&#8221; the United States government ran (and still run). But X-Files diehards (referred to as X-Philes &#8230; pun intended, I assume) and UFO-ologists believe that the object was a spacecraft of some kind. Many reports also seemed to indicate that passengers were recovered from the ship. But this much is known: the government denies anything other than a weather balloon crashed outside Roswell.<br />
Mind you, until 1995 the United States government also denied the existence of Area 51, a not-so-secret Air Force base at Groom Lake in Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. This is despite many photographs and video, Russian satellite photos, and large groups of people who go to the site to watch &#8220;black projects&#8221; go through their paces. Many in-the-know also believe the crashed UFO and some fully-functional UFOs are stationed at the Groom Lake facility.<br />
I resumed my stint behind the wheel, and we pulled back onto the I-40. This time we headed west again for brief time, until we picked up the I-25 going south. This was by far the easiest and the fastest route, taking about an hour and fifteen minutes to reach Socorro. From there we would take Highway 380 to Roswell. Socorro was also known for some rather interesting activities in the night sky, all denied by the government, of course.<br />
Despite the general lack of just about anything interesting in New Mexico, we managed to find a few objects and places that put the state in my &#8220;Strange Places To Visit&#8221; category (reports of UFOs aside). For starters, there&#8217;s the prison warning signs along the road. We missed the first one we passed, I barely got a good look at it. But we pulled over at the next one we found so I could get a good picture of it:<br />
<q>Do not pick up hitchhikers. Prison facilities.</q>Never before had I seen anything like that. I haven&#8217;t seen anything like that out of New Mexico ever since. Along that same stretch of the I-25, I also saw a VW Bug. Remember them? Yes, I know that&#8217;s not impressive, and I totally agree. The fact that this VW had an enormous pair of bull horns mounted to the roof completely amazed me. Not only did they look absolutely ludicrous on the tiny vehicle, they must&#8217;ve constituted a safety hazard in the event of a car crash.<br />
The desert opened before us very quickly, leaving only the brown and beige vastness to see. The only break in the monotony was the Rio Grande, which the I-25 ran along side. On the banks of the mighty river stood luscious trees and large bushes. The vegetation seemed to form an impenetrable wall, preventing the harsh conditions of the New Mexico wasteland from harming the delicate life giver.<br />
When we turned east onto Highway 380, that little slice of green quickly disappeared behind us. I expected us to start crossing through sandy desert at that point, but was surprised to find many low hills and shallow valleys rippled the land before us. The only indication that we were in or at least very near a desert were a few signs that warned of sandstorms in the area.<br />
But perhaps the most serious sign that we saw was for the White Sands Missile Range. More secretive government work, yes, but not the most significant reason &#8230; at least not for me. I knew that somewhere to the south of Highway 380 was the location of the infamous Trinity Site. There, in the early hours of July 16, 1945, humanity decided to try to beat God at His own game and crack the atom. For a brief instant the sky became brighter than day, and the nuclear age began.<br />
I wanted to see the site. But the AAA TourBook indicated that only two tours were made each year: one at the beginning of April, and one at the beginning of October. The Trinity Site is in the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range, but may still be in an active fire zone. Another possibility is lingering radioactivity, fatal to prolonged repeated exposure.<br />
New Mexico is the birthplace of Smokey the Bear. How did we find this out? We passed by the Smokey Bear Historical State Park. Several signs hinted at a monument of some kind that told the story of the Great Firestomper, but we never found it.<br />
We stumbled across another rather interesting curiousity somewhere between Capitan and Picacho, a distance of about 29 miles. One minute we were passing through a sea of dust, sand and small dark green shrubs, the next minute we were surrounded by a basalt lava flow. All around us was a massive black bumpy patch of rock. We pulled over for a moment t get a good look at it, to make sure we weren&#8217;t seeing things.<br />
Another reason we pulled over was to see if we could find a replacement for our lava rocks in the barbeque. The ones that were supplied with our little grill were horrible, barely large enough to keep from falling between the cracks (and sometimes not). But almost as soon as we pulled into what appeared to be a state park entrance, we saw the rules posted in large friendly letters for all to see: &#8220;Do not remove any rocks from this area.&#8221;<br />
So we pulled back out onto the road. But I pulled out a little too quick, and the CD player slid off the &#8220;doghouse&#8221; (the &#8220;doghouse&#8221; is an extension of the engine housing into the passenger compartment, creating a large bulge between the driver and navigator) and smashed into the floor, breaking the lid off. I was a little annoyed, mostly at myself for pulling out so fast. Fortunately, Dhar the engineer fixed our music supply and returned it to working order. One thing I&#8217;ll say for Sony, their CD players will take a burning, and keep on turning.<br />
A little under a half hour later, we entered Roswell. We didn&#8217;t know when we entered Roswell, as there weren&#8217;t any &#8220;Welcome to Roswell&#8221; signs. Less than a quarter mile after entering what I assume to be the city limits, we found ourselves in a time machine set for the 1950&#8217;s. It seemed aliens had taken over the city and prevented the citizens from building anything new.<br />
Despite the marker of a major city on the New Mexico map, Roswell was really nothing more than a large town of some 45,000 people buried in the middle of the New Mexico desert. Highway 380 formed one of two main roads running through Roswell, the other being Highway 285. Where they crossed, the intersection almost resembled one out of a major city &#8230; only without the traffic. It was one of a small number of intersections with traffic lights.<br />
Roswell seemed dead. There was hardly any life to the place whatsoever &#8212; virtually no moving cars, hardly any pedestrians, no animals or birds that we could see or hear. Even the vegetation looked stunted. Another temporal distortion seemed to surround the city, just like the one in Kansas, only not as severe. Even our breathing seemed to slow slightly. Little did we know that we found the home of unconcern, stoicism, and apathy.<br />
What we were looking for, we didn&#8217;t know. Asking someone about the UFO crash would illicit one of two responses: annoyance (derived from all the other curiousity seekers&#8217; constant badgering), or bewilderment at such a stupid question. So we simply drove along Highway 380 looking for something, anything, that might give a hint as to Roswell&#8217;s infamous past.<br />
In a motion that was nearly suggestive of pregnancy, Rebecca declared that she wanted ice cream. I say &#8216;nearly&#8217; because I was also guilty of such a declaration (even if I didn&#8217;t vocalize it), and medical science still hasn&#8217;t caused pregnancy in men. But do you think that we could find a single ice cream parlour? What it was with Southerners, I don&#8217;t know, but they seemed to have some strange aversion to cold foods.<br />
Before we knew it, the desert reappeared. Half of us wanted to go back to Roswell, and half of us wanted to go forward. So we compromised and continued going forward for a little while. The eastern side of Roswell was certainly more scenic than the western side, but when you compare a scraggly shrub to nothing, the difference is still significant (at least in a mathematical sense). After a few minutes we stumbled across the Bottomless Lakes State Park. The arrival of the dinner hour elicited a group decision to find a place to settle down and eat, and the park seemed as good a place as any.<br />
We turned onto the park road and started driving down its long, winding route. We drove for what seemed like endless miles. We began to wonder if the park had any lakes at all, if they had dried up like all the rivers we had seen in our travels through the dry states. Turn after turn, bend after bend, mile after mile, and nothing but some short grasses and bracken.<br />
But as we rounded a hill after about ten minutes, a body of water came into view. It looked like there was maybe two feet of water in the deepest portion. Evaporation had left huge white and gold rings of mineral deposits where the water had one been. It probably couldn&#8217;t support any life, partly hinted at by the lack of vegetation around the pond (which was pretty much what it was by that point). The park was rapidly beginning to be known as &#8220;Lakeless Bottom&#8221;.<br />
But we did eventually find it, about a mile away from the other lake bed. Oddly enough though, we didn&#8217;t immediately see it &#8212; it was surrounded. On the north side of the lake was a steep cliff. On the west side were trees just tall enough to shield our view. On the east and south sides was a picnic cum trailer park the state park service had erected. Unlike most of the other parks we had visited thus far (excluding the ones containing historical sites), this had a pay-for-use system &#8230; even if you only wanted to use the picnic area. We weren&#8217;t too keen on this aspect, so promptly turned around and hit the road again.<br />
In a few minutes we found ourselves at the top of the cliff on the north side of the lake, and received our first good look. Barely larger than the other dried-up lake we had seen earlier, some 100 to 150 metres in diametre and roughly circular in size, the lake would be considered a pond in most circles. As to its claim as being bottomless, we couldn&#8217;t really tell. It was a dark lake, but even a shallow lake can look dark.<br />
At any rate, the spot was a good place to have dinner. It was a gravel-laid lookout point for the lake next to the park road, surrounded with chain-link fencing to keep visitors from falling down the 80 metre cliff to what would probably be certain death.<br />
I hopped out the driver&#8217;s door, flipped up the running board flap, and turned on the propane. Rebecca delegated herself to cooking dinner &#8212; spaghetti with some mighty spicy tomato sauce. While we ate, several vehicles pulled up, usually families, to look over the cliff to the tiny lake below. Several families of flies visited us directly, an annoyance we could have done without.<br />
Just as we were finishing, a police car showed up. I began to panic. If this doesn&#8217;t say why I don&#8217;t like colouring outside the lines, I don&#8217;t know what does. I&#8217;ve been paranoid of the police for years, and I really don&#8217;t know why. I guess I was frightened that the police would come over and declare we were not supposed to be there, nail us with a large fine, and suddenly decide to search the van. In doing so they&#8217;d stumble across something that wasn&#8217;t supposed to be there, they&#8217;d confiscate the van, and I&#8217;d disappear into some deep dark prison never to see the light of day, and become the plaything for some a 230-pound rapist and mass murderer named Bubba.<br />
Yes, my mind wanders frequently. I often worry that one day, when I&#8217;m not attentive, it will wander into the road and get squished. Then I&#8217;d be in trouble&#8230;<br />
The cops sat there in the patrol car, looking in our general direction, then after a few moments drove off. I breathed a sigh of relief, much to the curiousity of the others, who hadn&#8217;t come close to being fazed by the presence of the long arm of the law.<br />
The dishes and the pots were cleaned, the leftovers heaved in a nearby dumpster. While Dhar and I got the van ready to be rolled out again, Stefan and Rebecca shared a moment outside, staring into the impending sunset, into the vastness of the American south-west.<br />
For some reason unknown to me then, and still a mystery to me now, I wanted to keep driving. It wasn&#8217;t that I hadn&#8217;t tired of driving &#8212; I actually wanted to keep driving. I don&#8217;t know why. But little argument was raised, so I resumed my position and we headed on our way out of the park. Fortunately the way out was much shorter than the way in.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan took refuge in &#8220;their&#8221; place in the back, Dhar rode shotgun. As we reentered Roswell, Stefan came forward and asked quietly if we could keep an eye open for any place that sold ice cream. (He wanted to make sure Rebecca&#8217;s desires were fulfilled.) It was a difficult request to fill, as there were no ice cream parlours of any kind to be found.<br />
No ice cream parlours, but that bastion of American cheap food, brusque service, and blatant commercialism happened to have a branch office in Roswell. We pulled into the McParking Lot(r), went in through the McDoors(r), and waited in the McLobby(r) so one of the under-paid McEmployees(r) with over-applied McMakeup(r) could take our McOrders(r).<br />
Several years ago, the Canadian branches of the McFranchise(r) had switched from milk-based ice cream and milkshakes to low fat versions. This meant the ice cream was now frozen yogurt, something which I considered so artificial I was never keen on eating it. However, in a trip to TCBY a couple years following the switch, I found I didn&#8217;t mind it so much. Ever since, I&#8217;d made quick work of the McHot Fudge Sundaes(r).<br />
What the American branches of the McFranchise(r) use, I have no clue. All I do know is that the McHot Fudge Sundae(r) certainly didn&#8217;t taste like a McHot Fudge Sundae(r). It might have been the fact that the McServer(r) had to scoop the McFudge(r) out of the McDispenser(r) when the McPump(r) broke. Her hand was coated with the chocolate goop, and said goop didn&#8217;t appear normal &#8230; at least to me.<br />
Complaints aside, Rebecca&#8217;s craving was diminished, if not satisfied, and our mission to Roswell had come to a close. Still retaining the driver&#8217;s seat, I took us out of the McParking Lot(r) and drove to Highway 285 for our trip into Texas.<br />
We still hadn&#8217;t quite figured out what we were going to do in Texas. One thing we had all wanted to do was find a beach on the Gulf of Mexico and spend the day soaking in the sun&#8217;s harmful rays, receiving sand mite bites, sucking in polluted salt water, and paying too much for a watered-down Coke. To do this, we were going to drive through the night until we got to Houston, at which point we would head south to the beach. I kept suggesting we visit the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, but received only lukewarm response. This was the extent of our planning.<br />
First things first however, and we still had 92 miles until we even entered the Lone Star State, let alone set course for the beach. The sun was scraping the horizon as we drove south. The sunset was like nothing we had seen on the trip to that point (nor would we see anything like it during the rest of the trip). As it set, the light on the horizon showed us a landscape so flat, it looked almost like a totally calm and smooth lake &#8212; perfectly flat, save for the odd bush that created a small bump. But unlike Arizona or Kansas, the flatness didn&#8217;t bother me. It was oddly calming &#8230; though I wouldn&#8217;t want to see it every day.<br />
With the coming of night came a better view of what was on the horizon. Sounds strange, doesn&#8217;t it? Throughout most of New Mexico that we saw, and probably a good chunk of Texas, were oil wells. Okay, maybe that doesn&#8217;t sound too spectacular, but as you travel down Highway 285, bright spots appear on that flat distant line. Oil wells and refineries, their lights burning through the night sky. The wind only confirmed our conclusions, the smell of petrochemicals could be easily smelled even as far as 60 miles away.<br />
Each night in Carlsbad, about an hour south of Roswell, there is a spectacle that draws huge crowds. At one of the natural entrances to the Carlsbad Caverns, millions of insect-eating bats take to the sky at sunset to feed. Seeing Carlsbad Caverns would have been an interesting addition to the day, and I so desperately wanted to see the bats. Unfortunately for me, and for all of us, the sun had fully set by the time we were less than 30 minutes from Carlsbad. No bats that night.<br />
Or so I thought. In the New Mexico desert, even on a clear night the amount of ambient light is pretty minimal (at least from inside a vehicle). Things along the roads are pretty hard to see. As we reached the area of Carlsbad Caverns, we encountered a few fledermaus. At first it was just glimpses of the winged mice as they avoided colliding with the Behemoth. But a couple of the more adventurous types decided to settle in the roads looking for a meal. I&#8217;m not scared of bats, but when one of those suckers takes off a few feet in front as you travel at 65 mph towards it, you&#8217;re bound to be a little startled.<br />
But nothing was nearly as nail-biting as our encounter of the fuzzy kind. Jack rabbits. Hundreds of them lined the highway. We didn&#8217;t notice them until one shot in front of the van as it crossed to the east side of the roadway. Dhar and I immediately developed rabbit radar, constantly scanning for the furry little buggers. I love nature, I don&#8217;t like driving over top of it, or smacking into it snapping vertebrae.<br />
At first, we thought it was just one or two. But after a couple minutes, we saw hundreds of green glowing eyes peering back from the scraggly grass at the sides of the highway. If we had been characters in a Stephen King novel, I&#8217;d be scared out of my wits at the sight of all those bewitched bunnies. The odd one would hop around, but for some reason most stared at us as we drove by. I suppose it&#8217;s the old &#8220;caught in the headlights&#8221; shtick, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that it&#8217;s still creepy. I could almost hear Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;good evening&#8221; echo in the van.<br />
We weren&#8217;t the only ones who knew the jack rabbits were there &#8212; we spotted a wily coyote prowling for dinner. I figured that with that many rabbits, he (or she) shouldn&#8217;t have too much trouble getting a bite to eat.<br />
The rabbits continued to the New Mexico / Texas border, then seemed to vanish. As we crossed into our 11th state of the trip, Rebecca promptly asked if we had been abducted by aliens. According to our clocks, no time had passed. I couldn&#8217;t find any hole in my memory, nor could anyone else. We all sighed dejectedly &#8212; nobody wanted us.<br />
Highway 285 started into a south-easterly direction once inside Texas. By this time, it was so dark the only way we knew we were in Texas was the sign welcoming us, and the dual speed limits: one for cars, and another for trucks driving at night. At first I assumed that the limits were only for the state highways, since they weren&#8217;t as well protected from animals as the Interstates. As it turned out, the limits were universal.<br />
Then one of the possible reasons came to light &#8212; deer. In Canada, large animals are a problem when driving through the boonies at night. If you&#8217;re not careful, you can say good-bye to your car, and if you&#8217;re particularly unlucky, your life. Moose are the worst problem, they&#8217;ll demolish large buses and walk away unscathed. Deer tend to explode a little more on contact, but are capable of a great deal of damage.<br />
We Canucks are very aware of these dangers (as a country of barely 28 million people and huge expanses of wilderness, we tend to be fairly in touch with nature), but Texans probably need to be reminded that they&#8217;re not invulnerable (as if The Alamo wasn&#8217;t enough of an explanation). Dhar and I still had our radar on full, so we felt pretty safe as we traveled towards the I-10.<br />
I drove until we arrived in Fort Stockton, where we picked up the I-10. It was only our second sign of civilization since Carlsbad. There we filled up with fuel before continuing our trek across Texas. The Flying J gas and convenience stores were becoming a regular sight to us. We could fill up not only on gas, but also on drinks and food for our seemingly endless driving.<br />
Most people told us that the driving would be hell, and we&#8217;d hate all the driving we were doing. To me, that wasn&#8217;t the case. Okay, Kansas and Arizona were hell, but beyond that the driving was actually fairly interesting &#8212; we were seeing parts of the continents we had never seen before. In only a week we had traveled through half a dozen different climates, each one containing a unique beauty.<br />
Texas seemed to have a climate very different from New Mexico. At Fort Stockton, we were over 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, yet the air was terribly sticky from the humidity. This was a new experience for me. Sure, I&#8217;d been to Florida before (see [[Music Trip to Orlando, Introduction|Music Trip to Orlando]]) and felt the ocean&#8217;s influence on the moisture in the air, but Florida is less than 200 miles wide and surrounded by massive bodies of water. Fort Stockton is very much land-locked. I never once expected the air to be so humid so far away from water. If anything, the trip was also becoming very educational.<br />
The gas wasn&#8217;t terribly cheap, but we now knew the reasons why. I paid for the gas (having to turn over my credit card even before beginning to pump gas) while the others made use of the restrooms and purchased more supplies for the odyssey. Then it was my turn to get some sleep. I had been driving for over 10 hours that day, and I was exhausted.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Roswell was uneventful. If we did get abducted, we don&#8217;t remember. We had dinner at Bottomless Lake, which for a while we thought was Lakeless Bottom. (This was partly due to the sheer number of dry river beds we&#8217;ve seen.)Dhar and I navigated through several miles of vicious Texas jack rabbits, vampire bats, wily coyotes and a few of Bambi&#8217;s relatives on our way into Texas. We&#8217;re about 5 hours or so outside of San Antonio.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke to a vaguely disturbing dream about sirens, manifested by emergency vehicles running up and down Las Vegas Boulevard, just in front of our 16th floor window. No sooner than my head cleared enough for me to realize I was awake that I heard a familiar whirring and buzzing, followed by a sharp shutter click and another quick whir. I suddenly realized with a bit of dread that Dhar had just taken my picture. I immediately flipped him my middle finger in response. His response was a cheery &#8220;Too late!&#8221; Stefan and Rebecca fell victim to our early-morning shutterbug a few seconds later.<br />
We moved surprisingly quick that morning, it took half as long to get Rebecca out of bed. We were showered and ready to go downstairs less than forty-five minutes, leaving us an hour and a half before we planned to check out, at 11:30. Prior to leaving for breakfast, we made certain that we packed up all our belongings so all we would have to do is grab our bags and exit the premises. I filled out an &#8220;Express Check Out&#8221; card that I left at Registration just before breakfast, avoiding the hassle of standing in line.<br />
Breakfast was at the buffet, after a ten minute lineup. Rebecca held our places in line while I ventured off to find a bank machine and obtain some cash. I wasn&#8217;t certain whether my card would be able to access the CIBC network properly or not, but I figured it was worth a shot. Figuring that I had spent only $100 in the first five days, I thought another $100 should get me a fair distance further. The machine spat out $100 a moment later.<br />
It spat out a $100 bill. At first I stared at the machine, wondering what moron would fill a bank machine with such large denominations. I actually slapped my forehead when I realized that I was in a casino, where this sort of thing was normal. But $100 was too much for me to carry around as a single banknote. I asked a nearby security guard where I could break the bill into smaller denominations. His look seemed to indicate that he thought I was a moron, but he pointed at the change booth positioned conveniently behind the bank machine. I slapped my forehead again.<br />
Returning to the buffet restaurant, I couldn&#8217;t find Rebecca, Stefan, or Dhar. The latter two appeared a moment later, having browsed a couple slot machines while I was getting money. As it turned out, Stefan was getting money too, winning $6. We ended up having to go in through the exit line to get to Rebecca. A moment later we were sitting at a booth at the back of the room, right next to the buffet tables.<br />
There was only a momentary pause before Stefan and I laid siege to the food. At all-you-can-eat buffets, some people make repeated trips, bringing back small portions of food each time. Stefan and I subscribe to a different philosophy: repeated trips waste calories &#8230; get it all the first time. Being buffet food, I didn&#8217;t expect a gourmet-quality repast, but for a breakfast it wasn&#8217;t too bad. What our breakfast lacked in quality, the buffet made up for with variation &#8212; cereal, fruit, steak, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, ham, hash browns &#8230; an endless sea of morning fare.<br />
We still had 45 minutes of free time before our planned exodus, so we decided to spend the time browsing around. This effectively split the four of us up with Stefan, Rebecca, and Dhar heading to the casino floor, and myself avoiding it. I was getting over my case of Lasvegasitis, and the constant binging and chiming was beginning to grate on my nerves. I opted to do some window shopping instead.<br />
I was determined to leave with some reminder of our stay at Treasure Island, but very little appealed to me. A few years earlier, I would&#8217;ve bought up half a store &#8230; I guess age does affect what you think is neat. At any rate, I browsed through every store in Treasure Island two or three times before visiting another store on an upper level, near the tram to Mirage and the walkway to the parking garage. There I managed to find a dark aquamarine baseball cap with a simple logo on the front.<br />
In finding the illusive store, I also found a piece of technology that I had heard about a couple years earlier on one of the many technology shows I watched on TV. On the escalator leading to the next floor up, riders pass by a large video wall. This in itself isn&#8217;t anything extraordinary, but if you look close you&#8217;ll see directional microphones suspended from the ceiling and jutting from the walls.<br />
Together these elements are used to create an interactive computer effect. Somewhere deep inside Treasure Island is a computer room, and in this room a performer straps himself into a movement apparatus called a &#8220;waldo&#8221;. On the video wall the performer&#8217;s movements become a computer animated cartoon pirate, the voice also supplied by the performer. The microphones pick up the voices of the escalator riders, essentially allowing the performer to have a conversation with the riders. Unfortunately the system was either no longer used, or wasn&#8217;t on during the time I was traveling up and down the escalator.<br />
Just under 45 minutes later I was back in the room, the others waiting for my arrival. We spent little time packing up our things for our journey to the Behemoth. Returning to the lobby, we opted to go out via the parking garage instead of out the front entrance. Dhar commented on the way that the incessant tones of the slots were driving him mad. I knew exactly what he meant.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960426.115</strong><br />
<em>Day 6</em><br />
Leaving Las Vegas. It&#8217;s an interesting place, but only in small doses. Besides, there are a great many more things to see&#8230;<br />
The Hoover Dam is up next, we should be in Albuquerque by tonight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the already hot temperatures, the van was actually fairly cool inside, thanks to the power of the almighty ceiling fan. We stored our gear, checked the oil, and fired up the engine. While we were waiting for the engine to warm up, I checked the battery power to see how much it had been drained in the 20 or so hours we had left it unplugged. Surprisingly, the level wasn&#8217;t terribly low.<br />
It became fairly apparent why the level was so high when I checked the fridge &#8230; it was still set for 110 volt power. I had forgotten to change the power to 12 volt when we left the KOA the day before. I immediately set the fridge for 12 volt to keep it from getting any warmer, and prayed that what perishable food we had in there wouldn&#8217;t go bad.<br />
That problem aside, we pulled out of the parking lot and hit the road. We traveled north on Las Vegas Boulevard to pick up with Highway 93, which would take us back to the Hoover Dam. Along the way we stopped at the Graceland Chapel so Stefan could take a picture of Dhar and Rebecca in front of it. I waited in the van since they were only gone a few minutes. That act started a rash of jokes about Dhar being married to Rebecca. Interestingly enough, the jokes didn&#8217;t seem to bug Stefan much.<br />
And so we hit our first batch of real traffic. Like many places we had traveled through thus far, Las Vegas was doing construction work on the highway, and it was completely tying up traffic. Normally, I hate traffic. I hate it so much I now refuse to drive into Toronto unless it can&#8217;t be avoided (or I know the traffic will be light). But even though I was behind the wheel that morning, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered. About 20 minutes after entering the mess, we were clear on our way.<br />
Nevada looks very different in the day &#8212; mostly brown and beige with a few splotches of green. Leftovers of the Rocky Mountains and its foothills give some texture to the land. Fortunately, the 30 miles from Las Vegas to the Hoover Dam go by fairly quickly.<br />
This time Dhar and Rebecca were awake, and duly impressed with the gorge as we started to travel down the west side of the valley. Although Stefan and I got a good look at the dam some 36 hours earlier, daylight cast a whole new perspective on the massive structure.<br />
We parked in a newly-built parking garage on the Nevada side and strolled across Highway 93 (reduced to a two lane road with a speed maximum of 15 miles an hour) to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. We immediately signed up for a tour of the dam, at a cost of five dollars apiece. At the time I considered this a reasonable price, even if the actual tour didn&#8217;t last as long as I thought it would have.<br />
Starting at the top of the dam, we had to travel down about 600 feet to the river level. The tour group numbered about 50 to 60 people, which could be accommodated in the two immense elevators. Each of the two cars in the cylindrical shaft could carry at least 30 people, and probably closer to 50. (When you&#8217;re crammed in like sardines, trying not to grope the person next to you by accident, and ignoring the increasing heat, you tend not to notice the precise number of people in the elevator.)<br />
At the bottom we were quickly shuffled out to the balcony of the Nevada-side generating bay. Four American football fields in length, the bay was an impressive construction. Eight massive turbine-powered generators ran the length of the bay, with a much smaller ninth generator near the front, providing power for the dam&#8217;s offices, elevators, lights and so forth.<br />
A few minutes of speech from our tour guide (who constantly stepped over her own words and could barely be heard even with the use of a PA system), and she led us down a flight of stairs to the generator bay floor, and out a door to the outside. We were now where the water from the reservoir exited from the penstocks back into the Colorado River. Behind us was the towering dam, an awesome sight from below.<br />
Here we were shown the transformers which took the raw power from the generators and sent it into the electrical grid. The electrical cables ran almost straight up the side of the canyon walls to towers that stood out almost on a 90 degree angle, then into Nevada. The same setup existed on the Arizona side. The wires criss-crossing the valley seemed to form an immense spider&#8217;s web. Only here, it would be the web that killed you, not the spider.<br />
Following a quick schpeal about the transformers, the guide went on to discuss the dam itself. I already knew a fair bit from documentaries I had seen, but seeing it on TV and seeing it in reality are two totally different things. On TV, it seems like an everyday occurrence. Standing about 30 feet above the Colorado River, staring nearly 700 feet to the top of the dam is an unbelievable sight. The dam is so massive that engineers estimate that barring any major catastrophe (such as earthquake registering over 8 on the Richter scale), the dam should last about 2,000 years. Had I heard that on the documentaries, I would&#8217;ve passed it off as over-confidence. Having actually seen it, I think the estimate&#8217;s a bit low.<br />
Dhar had been a little preoccupied with crossing the dam the first time, afraid that it might crack beneath us. Now at the bottom of the gorge, he was even more concerned. Even I was a little apprehensive. But one of the dam&#8217;s design features made Dhar all the more paranoid &#8230; it leaked. At the seams of the concrete forms, you could see the dark telltale marks of water seepage. Another tourist in our group asked about that, the tour guide promised it was designed that way.<br />
The last stop of the tour was some 200 feet into the canyon wall. Here we were led into a room that overlooked the massive penstock pipes. These pipes came down from the intake towers in the reservoir, delivering water to the generator turbines. Some 30 or 40 feet in diametre, and using pins (rivets) that were six inches across, the pipes contained water under so much pressure that the room we stood in vibrated &#8230; and it wasn&#8217;t even directly connected to the pipe.<br />
Here the guide told us how the water is delivered from Lake Mead to the generators, and how the water was diverted while the dam was under constructions. Another interesting fact of Hoover Dam: it has two spillways, designed to take in water in the event of a flash flood. The spillways are each large enough to contain the volume of water that goes over Niagara Falls in one second (5520 cubic metres, or about 194,940 cubic feet).<br />
The tour thus ended. I was a little disappointed that we had seen all there was to see. I wanted to see the control room, or something else that&#8217;s usually &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221;. We were led back to the elevators to take us back to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. We opted not to see the documentary film, but decided to check out the dam for ourselves. We found our way to the Lake Mead side of the dam, where we found a gift shop. Finally I had found tacky stuff. And by tacky, I am referring to mounted heads of the illusive jackalope (a jack rabbit with antelope horns glued on for show).<br />
I purchased a rather huge mug (the only truly tacky thing that I bought during the trip) and a rock from the canyon to give to my soon-to-be-ex-manager at a job I would quit a few days after returning home. (A very long story, summarized in that the job I was supposed to get ended up going to someone else, and I was going to be bussing tables, through no fault of my own. Thanks, but no thanks.) The rock was supposed to be from the Grand Canyon, but I had forgotten to get one. The rock here looked similar in formation (an advantage of having taken geology courses), so I figured I would at least try to pass it off. (I never did find out if she got the rock or not.)<br />
The time came for us to hit the road again, and start gaining hours as we headed east. Stefan and Rebecca went back for the van while Dhar and I walked to Arizona, taking pictures as we went. I finished off the last of a roll of film (as did Dhar), and I took a couple pictures with my panoramic camera. Part of the way across we came by a restroom, which I desperately needed to make use of.<br />
Most of the architecture of the dam was art deco, the style commonly used in the 1930&#8217;s, when the dam was built. Even the washrooms retained the style &#8230; the toilets actually looked like the ones installed in the 1930&#8217;s. I couldn&#8217;t help but comment on this to Dhar when I came out.<br />
A few minutes later we stood on the Arizona side waiting for Rebecca and Stefan to drive by. They barely stopped, just long enough for us to dive in the side door before continuing on. Our next intended stop was to be in Flagstaff.<br />
My dad had drilled into me for years that engine oil needed to be changed every 5,000 kilometres, no matter what. The Behemoth would hit the mark just outside of Flagstaff, making it the ideal place to get an oil change. But first we had to cross over three and a half hours of Arizona, and it was already 14:00 Mountain time.<br />
We drove down to Kingman again, pausing only long enough to hop from Highway 93 to the I-40 to head east. The trip was fairly uneventful, we found various ways to amuse ourselves including playing Stefan&#8217;s favourite song, Sugar Sugar. (This was from my Saturday Morning CD, a compilation of themes from old Saturday morning cartoon shows, remade by current alternative bands.) Previously a song from the Archies, Sugar Sugar was remade by Mary Lou Lord with Semisonic. It was just as sugary-sweet as the original song (no pun intended), and just as evilly catchy. Several times Stefan would unconsciously start humming it, which led to at least one other person humming it, which lead to someone realizing that it was being hummed, which led to conscious thought and the realization that the song was actually very annoying.<br />
We had a reasonably extensive CD collection with us, most of them from my &#8220;store&#8221;. I use the term as a result of all the chiding I received from my friends. At the time of the trip, I had in excess of 435 CDs. An impressive collection perhaps, but no more so than a few people I know who have over 1,200 CDs in addition to endless boxes of LPs and the few hundred-odd cassette tapes.<br />
Long before my family had even bought the Behemoth, I had sent a request to Stefan and Rebecca to decide what music to listen to, sending them a list of every album I owned. I personally had no qualms about what they chose &#8212; my logic was straightforward, whatever they wanted to listen I owned anyway. After a bit of prodding I finally got a list in return that contained what I would consider &#8220;easy-listening&#8221; music. What I didn&#8217;t know was that they listened to music that was as every bit as harsh as some of the music I listened to, and we had many similarities in our likes and dislikes. In theory, I could have grabbed a bunch of CDs at random and it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered.<br />
To give you an idea of what we did listen to, here&#8217;s the list:</p>

<p>There were several other CDs in the pack I brought along, but we never got a chance to listen to them. Several of the albums were chosen by me for a specific contribution to the trip: theme music. ZZ Top was included for their rendition of Viva Las Vegas. The Tragically Hip supplied New Orleans Is Sinking. REM gave us Drive. Unfortunately I had neglected to bring Sheryl Crow (Leaving Las Vegas), any Elvis albums, Paul Simon (Graceland), or Phil Collins (Take Me Home).<br />
About a third of the way across Arizona, we realized our gasoline supply was dwindling fast. We also knew that the western end of Arizona had much higher gas prices than the eastern end. We tried our best to keep the supply running as long as we could, but soon it became all too clear that no matter what we did, we needed fuel and we needed it quickly.<br />
We pulled off at Seligman, some tiny speck on the map, where we hoped there would be an open gas bar. We crossed to the north side of I-40, and turned east onto a small road. Turning left, we headed over to a dusty gas station, in the middle of a small dusty town. There were hardly any trees, virtually no green grass &#8230; there were hardly any people. Except for the ones driving in the replica roadsters. We&#8217;d seen a few of them earlier as we were driving, but couldn&#8217;t understand why there seemed to be so many of them. When we saw the sign, it all came much clearer:<br />
<q> Welcome to Seligman. Birthplace of Historic Route 66. </q>So we were on the infamous Route 66. We didn&#8217;t get any kicks &#8230; except in the ass when we saw the price of gas. But when you&#8217;re too low to know whether or not you&#8217;ll get to the next station, you don&#8217;t quibble about it. Instead we tossed in about $10, praying it would get us to our next stop. We spent only enough time in Seligman to buy the gas and record the fact that we&#8217;d been there. We then peeled rubber to get out of there &#8212; it was a little too backwater for our liking.<br />
We arrived in Flagstaff about 19:00 that evening, which was an hour too late to get an oil change. We didn&#8217;t realize this until we had already spent a half hour searching through phone books for lube garages in the area and drove around trying to find them. Already about 150 kilometres over the 5,000 kilometre mark, I was a little apprehensive about driving any further for fear of damaging a new engine. But staying in Flagstaff overnight meant a delay in our schedule, possibly meaning we would have to sacrifice one of our planned destinations. It was four and three quarter hours from Flagstaff to Albuquerque, a distance I wasn&#8217;t too keen on traveling, but in the long run it was better for us to do so.<br />
With some trepidation, we jumped back on I-40 and continued our eastern haul. We drove for about 40 miles before pulling into one of the Arizona rest stops, about 20 miles west of Winslow. Resting in one of the many vast endless terrains in the south-west, the rest stop intruded as little into the area as possible. The only significant structures were the washroom building and the picnic shelters.<br />
Inhabiting one of the picnic sites, we set up our portable barbeque on one of the concrete tables and fired it up to cook the hot dogs. While we were stopped, I also took the liberty of switching the fridge over to the propane supply to try and drop the temperature. The 12 volt system was really only good for keeping the contents at a specific temperature, you needed the 110 volt supply or the propane supply to really get the fridge cold.<br />
Our picnic site had three partial (non-contacting) walls and a flat roof, all made from poured concrete. Behind us was a small rock formation, bearing a sign to watch for scorpions and rattlesnakes. We neither saw or heard any of the dangerous beasties, but the sign wouldn&#8217;t have been there if the danger wasn&#8217;t real. After eating most of the hot dogs (a fortunate idea, preventing them from going bad), Rebecca and Dhar strolled onto the rocks to look into the setting western sun. Their report stated the view would have been much better if some schmuck hadn&#8217;t built his house next to the rest stop.<br />
We flirted with the idea of locking up for the night and sleeping there. But my sense of rules came back into play again, and I flat-out refused to. I hated playing the asshole, but my inability to &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; pretty much prohibited rebellion. A long list of rules posted at the front of every rest stop prohibited camping overnight. A truck pulling an Airstream trailer wasn&#8217;t so picky, they had dropped anchor for the night and didn&#8217;t appear to be moving any time before morning.<br />
The sun had set almost entirely by the time we pulled back onto the I-40. What light that was left cast some of the most beautiful deep red light onto the rock and sand, it looked like we were driving over an open wound in the Earth&#8217;s skin.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
So much for oil changes &#8211; by the time we got to Flagstaff all the lube shops and gas stations had closed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We had dinner at one of the Arizona rest stops tonight. We had to be on the watch for rattlesnakes and scorpions. We didn&#8217;t see any. 280 miles to Albuquerque.</p></div>
<p>It took only a few minutes for us to get bored. Driving across Arizona was in many respects like driving across Kansas &#8212; it was so dull your brain doesn&#8217;t work properly. As such, my memory of crossing Arizona the second time is rather non-existant. Though most likely we gabbed for a good portion of the distance. Either that or Stefan and Rebecca went to sleep, Dhar drove and I rode shotgun. (It was a commonly enough done theme that I tend to forget when it was done.)<br />
At midnight, we were possessed with a serious case of the munchies. Barely inside New Mexico, we pulled into the first major city would could find. Gallup was hardly major by our standards, a population of only 19,200, but when considered the population of New Mexico was only 1.5 million and most of the cities had less than 100,000 residents, Gallup became a fair bit more significant than in other places of the country.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t eat anything that we were carrying with us, the only thing we had left were uncooked potatoes (and although mashed potatoes are always a welcome meal, we didn&#8217;t have any way of cooking them quickly), a little bit of salsa (which despite the fact that I don&#8217;t eat salsa, we had nothing for it to go with), and a couple boxes of President&#8217;s Choice White Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese Dinner (a much fancier version of Kraft Dinner). Suffice to say, none of us were in the cooking mood.<br />
Rebecca wanted KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), to which Dhar was objecting (with good reason). I wasn&#8217;t that hungry, so I played indifferent to the whole deal. But by the time we found a KFC, we found it had already closed. A McDonald&#8217;s lurked nearby, so we opted to buy something from there instead. The lobby looked closed, so we pulled into the drive-through and sat next to the speaker waiting for someone to take our order.<br />
And we sat. And sat, and sat, and sat. After about ten minutes it was becoming pretty damn clear that no-one was going to take our order. A car in front of us seemed to have already given an order, and was waiting for the order to be filled. Our little lineup hadn&#8217;t gone unnoticed, more cars appeared behind us. But our patience had worn completely thin. Well pulled out of the line and drove out to the road we came in on. When we looked back as we drove off, the lights in the McDonald&#8217;s were turned off. We were none too impressed with the lack of service.<br />
Gallup had few roads that led to interchanges with the I-40. As a result, we ended up having to drive quite a distance before finding the next interchange. But the drive wasn&#8217;t without fortune, as we found a 24 hour restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump from the Interstate. Hunger now getting the best of us, we pulled in to obtain sustenance.<br />
The restaurant (the name of which escapes me &#8230; c&#8217;mon, it was nothing to celebrate &#8212; if it was, I&#8217;d let you know) was one of a small chain of eateries that ran through the south-west. The general premise was, as usual, &#8220;home-cooking&#8221;. That is the single most over-used and under-achieving terms I have ever heard. This particular restaurant was sparsely populated, and even then the waitress seated us away from everyone else. Somehow, someone was tracking us and warning others of our imminent arrival.<br />
The meals were nothing spectacular, we quickly figured out why the restaurant chain was only in three states. Dhar&#8217;s spicy chicken wasn&#8217;t, my roast beef drowned in the gravy, Rebecca&#8217;s dinner was nearly unspeakable, and Stefan&#8217;s hamburger wasn&#8217;t fit for a dog (or Stefan, for that matter). But hunger is a strange thing &#8212; you&#8217;ll eat nearly anything to calm that rumbling stomach.<br />
About half an hour to 40 minutes later, we boarded the Behemoth, and I took over driving for the rest of the night. The temperature in New Mexico was rather chilly, so we actually ended up using the car heater for a while until we were a bit warmer. Out we pulled and hit the road once again.<br />
The rest of the drive to Albuquerque was uneventful. Somewhere around 02:00, we pulled into New Mexico&#8217;s largest city and started searching for the KOA. Fortunately for us, the KOA Catalogue provided excellent maps for finding the often hard-to-find campgrounds. We pretty much had to drive to the opposite side of the city before getting off the I-40 to get onto Central Avenue.<br />
As was becoming a regular occurrence, Stefan had to do a late check-in. All of us were on the verge of dropping off to sleep (Rebecca had already passed out), and the sooner that we park and slept, the better. Stefan returned in a few minutes and directed us to a slot about 200 metres from the main office, conveniently located next to the washrooms.<br />
Dhar made an immediate run for the toilet, as we hadn&#8217;t stopped for an hour or so and his bladder was on the verge of springing a leak (pun intended). But as we quickly found out, the washrooms were closed for the season. This I found rather odd &#8212; what seasons are there in New Mexico other than summer and not-quite-as-warm-as-summer-but-better-than-winter? Nevertheless, Stefan and Dhar when hunting for the washrooms. Being too tired to care (or urinate, for that matter), I just pulled my bed out, drew most of the blinds, crawled into my sleeping bag and started to nod off.<br />
Stefan and Dhar returned a moment or two later, reporting that the only washroom they could find had a combination lock on it, prevent us from getting in that night. Dhar ended up relieving himself on the right front tire.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One thing about using an air conditioner &#8212; always use the air exchange feature. The air inside the van was beyond musty that morning. It smelled horrible. I woke blinking towards the navigator&#8217;s side of the van, expecting to see Dhar sleeping. He wasn&#8217;t there. I looked back to the rear bunk. Both Stefan and Rebecca continued to sleep soundly, but our mysterious friend had vanished.<br />
He was outside sitting on the picnic table, waiting for the rest of us to rise. I chatted with him briefly before heading into the shower, and it seemed that Dhar had been getting into trouble. Dhar seemed to be really good at this &#8212; trouble always managed to find him no matter where he went. He also ran into a few of the night people &#8230; y&#8217;know, the kind that should be sent to pasture at the local funny farm? Dhar had not slept that night, and had walked along Boulder Highway for several hours. I was somewhat surprised that he hadn&#8217;t attempted to walk to The Strip.<br />
Next thing I knew, Stefan and Rebecca leapt from the Behemoth, ready to face the day. They had gone to sleep no earlier than 04:00, and had only four and a half or so hours of sleep. Nevertheless, carpe diem was the battle cry and I had to ride the tide of enthusiasm with my freshly-waxed surfboard of enthusiasm. The first order of business, a swim in the pool.<br />
Dhar, as usual, wasn&#8217;t up for a swim that early. (Actually, he was never up for a swim. I began to wonder if he even really took showers &#8212; maybe Dhar dissolved in water.) Rebecca, Stefan, and myself sauntered over to the pool and got ready to take a plunge. But the signs said that the pool wasn&#8217;t open until for another half an hour. This little detail didn&#8217;t block Stefan or Rebecca, they proudly swung the fence gate open and walked into the pool area.<br />
Now I had a small problem with this. When I was in elementary school, I got in trouble all the time. I wasn&#8217;t a bully, I just kept breaking rules all the time. Nothing serious, but the Principal got to know me fairly well after a couple years. Formative years are an important thing to a kid, and in time I learned when to follow the posted signs. I don&#8217;t always, but I did that morning. This compliance with societal (and KOA) rules brought the Wrath of Rebecca upon me again, chiding me to &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; and be more out-going. I decided to get wet in a shower instead.<br />
That morning I began to set a plan into motion. One thing Las Vegas had in abundance was hotels &#8230; and there were no two alike. Even before the trip had started, I had decided for myself that we had to spend at least one night in a Vegas hotel. The only problem: too many hotels, only one night. So while I was showering, I tried to think of the best place to stay. And came up blank. The best hotel I had ever stayed in before was the Contemporary Resort Hotel in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. That was 1980. 16 years later I was now in the adult&#8217;s Disney World, and in need of a hotel of equal splendour.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca returned from the pool not long after I finished bathing, and started for their daily romps through the shower. I proceeded to the AAA TourBook on Nevada and looked through the resort hotels that were around. Caesar&#8217;s Palace, the Luxor, the MGM Grand, the Mirage &#8230; all of them expensive. Enter second stage of my master plan &#8212; I would drive that morning and conspicuously drive into one of them and book a room before anyone knew what hit them. But to insure I wouldn&#8217;t be tied to the bumper and dragged home, I would also foot the bill. Hey, if you&#8217;ve got inheritance, might as well use it! (I think my grandmother would have approved &#8212; she traveled all the time until her eyesight grounded her.)<br />
But first to figure out where to go. I nonchalantly asked Stefan if there was any hotel in Vegas he wanted to stay at, which one would it be. The answer was immediate: Caesar&#8217;s Palace. But almost before I could away, out came the dreaded question I was afraid would come: &#8220;Why [do you ask]?&#8221;<br />
I don&#8217;t like lying outright. I&#8217;ll tell tall tales, I&#8217;ll stretch the truth. But this is the kind of question I don&#8217;t like answering dishonestly. So I leveled with him.<br />
&#8220;Let&#8217;s stay there for a night. It&#8217;s right on The Strip. It&#8217;s an experience we can&#8217;t miss!&#8221;<br />
Stefan was immediately excited about the prospect, but his financial side quickly took over. &#8220;I dunno &#8230; can we afford to?&#8221;<br />
To this I was quick to respond, &#8220;Can we afford not to?&#8221;<br />
(For those of you who don&#8217;t recognize this little two-sided banter, try to remember a VISA commercial where a couple pulls up to the gates of this enormous hotel, stare at it in awe, then the guy asks simply: &#8220;Can we afford to?&#8221; The girl naturally answers: &#8220;Can we afford not to?&#8221; They change their clothes and in they go. I had similar aspirations.)<br />
I had hoped that the conversation would end there, but they persisted on discussing the matter. This is the problem with personal agendas &#8230; no-one else ever knows what the hell you&#8217;re up to at any given moment. The expense of the room was a problem for them, particularly Stefan and Rebecca who were already up to their eyeballs in debts for school. I knew this, but I also knew of a way to correct this problem.<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221; I said smugly.<br />
&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Rebecca queried. I had a sneaky suspicion she knew what I was up to. Again, this is a question I don&#8217;t like avoiding.<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s on me.&#8221;<br />
Most of my friends would just look at me oddly and accept it. (Although that comes after a great deal of experience dealing with my odd behaviour.) Stefan and Rebecca know that from time to time I&#8217;ll pay for a dinner for my friends. I&#8217;m just that kind of person. I wanted to pay for the hotel room because I knew that neither Stefan or Rebecca could afford it, and I wanted to stay in a room for one night. Dhar, of course, knew nothing of my philanthropic tendencies.<br />
A debate ensued where I was supposed to cave in and let the others help out with the bill. (This is a typical response to such an action.) But if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from my father (and my grandmother), it&#8217;s stubbornness. I refused to budge. Even if I gave you a level long enough, you&#8217;d still have a tough time moving me. Dhar argued he was more stubborn and eventually would pay me for his share of a room. I looked and couldn&#8217;t help but laugh &#8212; I&#8217;ve heard that claim before, but never has it been substantiated by anyone.<br />
That argument aside, I proceeded to the KOA office to square away more postcards and stamps. I was surprised to find slot machines inside &#8230; I then kicked myself for forgetting what city I was in. In a gaming room just off the office floor, I also found an antique Pac-Man video game machine, circa early 1980&#8217;s. I hadn&#8217;t seen one of those machines in nearly a decade. Alas it wasn&#8217;t running, but its use was well documented by the phosphor burns in the screen. When Stefan came in a few minutes later, I made sure he saw it as well.<br />
We unhooked the van and drove it up to the KOA office so I could deposit my postcards. Dhar took the opportunity to empty the wastewater tanks so we didn&#8217;t have to haul sludge around with us. Then we started on the second order of the day: breakfast.<br />
For all the ridicule that it gets, the International House of Pancakes has got to be one of the few restaurants on my list that I would willingly go to at a moment&#8217;s notice. Especially first thing in the morning (which it was at the time). Fortunately for us, Dhar had found it a few hours earlier during his tour of Boulder Highway.<br />
Las Vegas has one major industry: service. If it weren&#8217;t for service, most of Vegas probably wouldn&#8217;t exist. As such, every place you go has people so nice, you&#8217;d think you were back home in Canada. Our hostess was a grandmother (or so she claimed), and seemed to only have the job to keep her busy. But she was one of those kinds of people who loved what she did. (And if she hated her job, she did an awfully good job of hiding it.)<br />
Huge breakfasts were the order &#8212; the table was full of plates, bowls, glasses, decanters, and jugs. Every last scrap of edible material was consumed by someone (usually Stefan), with our lovely hostess continually trying to get me to order a hot fudge sundae to finish it all off. Okay, I&#8217;m a chocoholic, I love sugary things, but even I have my limits to what I&#8217;ll eat for breakfast. (Stop laughing &#8230; I&#8217;m serious here! Really!)<br />
Paying for breakfast, we piled back into the Behemoth and tried to figure out how to get downtown. A quick perusal of the map indicated that Flamingo Road or Tropicana Avenue would provide an adequate route to Las Vegas Boulevard, more commonly known as &#8220;The Strip&#8221;. My carefully thought out plan wasn&#8217;t quite working &#8230; Stefan ended up driving. (My plans very seldom go as planned.)<br />
Vegas is an interesting place &#8212; the casinos seem to be confined to certain areas, all within a block of The Strip. (Mind you, those are big city blocks.) When we reached the corner of Flamingo Road and The Strip, we were surrounded by Bally&#8217;s on our left, the Barbary Coast Hotel on our right side, and Caesar&#8217;s Palace across the road from Barbary Coast. Stefan had seen all this before, but the collective jaws of Dhar, Rebecca and myself dropped at the sight. It was broad daylight so none of the lights were on, but we could easily see what was in store for us that evening. We couldn&#8217;t wait for the sun to set.<br />
We turned north on The Strip and quickly entered the left lane to turn into Caesar&#8217;s driveway. The hotel was the largest I had ever seen to that point. It sprawled about, almost a mile long when you included the mall tacked on to the north end of the casino. The grounds were a deep green (from the seemingly hourly watering) with impressive statues and small buildings. A huge textured dome revealed the presence of the Omnimax theatre that had been installed a few years previous. We had a desire to see whatever movie was playing, provided it wasn&#8217;t Wings of Courage. Val Kilmer is a great actor, but it was such a waste of movie for the technology.<br />
Following the signs, we turned left into an area meant for taxis and valet parking &#8230; neither of which fit our bill. But I was more intent on getting the room squared away as quickly as possible. I hopped out with Rebecca in tow while Stefan and Dhar attempted to make their way through the jam of cars to a safe place to wait for our return. And so I entered one of the most legendary hotel casinos in the world &#8230;<br />
Just inside the main door was a rotating four-sided sign advertising several of the hotel&#8217;s features among them the Omnimax movie &#8230; Wings of Courage. (So much for the movie.) When I turned to face into the hotel, I again felt culture shock. If Boulder Station had been impressive, the floor of Caesar&#8217;s Palace was beyond description. (And the sound was so deafening, that sexually-repressed prude would&#8217;ve had a heart attack and died.)<br />
It took us a moment to figure out where to go, but we quickly found the check-in desk, conveniently tucked away on one side. I jumped in line, about the 30th person, and waited patiently to check-in. Rebecca started back to the van to tell Dhar and Stefan we would be a while. Then I saw the sign that read: &#8220;Check-out 12:00&#8221;. It was noon. Check-in was at 15:00. I quickly grabbed Rebecca before she got too far.<br />
The next logical step: use a telephone. The phones weren&#8217;t too far away, and I couldn&#8217;t help but think of the circularity of having to call the hotel from a hotel phone to book a room at that hotel. The phones were standard pay-phones, but the handsets all had Caesar&#8217;s Palace logos engraved into them. A rather elegant, albeit tacky, touch.<br />
The Reservations desk couldn&#8217;t help &#8212; all the rooms were booked. Unfortunately, I saw this coming. The next step was to find an alternative. I started flipping through the book looking for something that would be just as fun. I ruled Luxor out because it was at the end of The Strip, and I really didn&#8217;t feel like walking all that distance. The Mirage and the MGM Grand looked interesting, but then Treasure Island popped out before my eyes. Rebecca had no qualms with the choice, so I dropped another coin and started dialing.<br />
If I thought calling Caesar&#8217;s Palace from one of their own phones was circular, the idea of calling one of their competition was absolutely ironic. But fortunate &#8230; Treasure Island wasn&#8217;t booked, despite a convention they were apparently hosting. I immediately made a reservation for a nice room that the four of us could share.<br />
This booking took a bit of thought. Originally Dhar and I had considered getting a room on our own so we could leave Rebecca and Stefan alone for an evening. But I knew I couldn&#8217;t afford two good rooms (there wasn&#8217;t such a thing as a mediocre room in these places), so I opted for something large enough that we wouldn&#8217;t feel crowded.<br />
Then I remembered Rebecca&#8217;s desire for a hot tub. I asked whether any of the rooms had such facilities. A suite called a &#8220;Pirate&#8217;s Cove&#8221; had Jacuzzis, which was close enough to our needs. The cost was substantially higher, but I felt that the price would be worth the experience. I read out my VISA information to the clerk to reserve the room (with little fear of being overheard &#8212; the phones were quite near the casino floor), and asked when we could take occupancy. It seemed that all hotels had a 15:00 check-in.<br />
Stefan had managed to find a place to pull in just down from the taxi and valet spaces. After a quick report of the driving skills of the valets, we started back towards The Strip. We wanted to see what it was all about, and since we had about three hours to kill, driving for a while seemed like a good idea.<br />
We passed by the Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Mirage, Harrah&#8217;s, Treasure Island, Sands (the last of the Vegas greats, which closed its doors only two months later), Desert Inn, Frontier, Riviera, and Circus Circus before The Strip more or less ended. Just a ways from the Frontier stood one of the newest additions to The Strip, the Stratosphere. Billed as the tallest free-standing tower in America, it looked suspiciously like the Seattle&#8217;s Space Needle. The last time Stefan had been in Las Vegas he had seen the construction sign for it, and he thought it the sign had said tallest in the world.<br />
Parts of the structure and its accompanying hotel and casino were still under construction when we stayed in Vegas, but it was very close to completion. So much so we wondered whether or not the hotel was open for business or not. As we passed by, Dhar noticed an odd red ring that seemed to circle the top of the observation level of the tower. Almost at once we realized what it was&#8230;<br />
Some idiot put a roller coaster at the top of Las Vegas. On the outside of the tower. It ran along the edge of the observation level in a nice circle, perhaps twice (at its height we couldn&#8217;t get a clear view). The idea was simultaneously unthinkable and exciting. I immediately wanted to know if it was ready for use. Although we never officially found out for certain, not once did we see a coaster train in operation. I had to wonder how many guarantees the local Government was given to allow such a thing to be built.<br />
(And on that note, I found out about a year later that the roller coaster is only half the fun up there. In addition to swinging out over Vegas streets 1000 feet below, there is also another ride which catapults you up another 200 feet or so into the air. I don&#8217;t know what raving lunatic came up with those ideas, but the mere thought of dangling 1,200 feet above the ground doesn&#8217;t exactly appeal to me.)<br />
Once the interesting part of Las Vegas Boulevard had ended, we entered into the seedier part of area, with motels bearing signs such as: &#8220;Elvis Slept Here&#8221; and &#8220;Recommended By Owner&#8221; (if those aren&#8217;t the best reviews you&#8217;ve ever heard &#8230; go somewhere else). One of the few establishments that was of any interest was the Graceland Chapel, one of the marriage institutions that will marry you to your loved one for a mere $25. An added bonus at the Graceland Chapel was to receive the service from an Elvis impersonator. But State law said that you had to be married first, and could only renew vows with said impersonator. Alas, no fun for poor little Geoff.<br />
We continued along Las Vegas Boulevard until we reached the Fremont Street area. Fremont is where one can find &#8220;Las Vegas Classic&#8221; &#8212; what&#8217;s left of the original casinos. A couple years ago the city council (mostly likely under some pressure from casinos and businesses on Fremont Street) turned a few blocks of Fremont Street into a pedestrian mall. To make the area more interesting, the road was also covered with a roof. But this was no ordinary roof.<br />
I had first heard about it on CNN, probably on the Science and Technology Week program. The roof extended over a two to three block distance. This in itself was nothing unusual, I&#8217;d heard of such structures in other places. But this is Las Vegas, not some boring metropolis. The underside of the roof was covered with six million coloured lights, in effect creating a gigantic video wall. Every hour the roof comes alive with a light show the likes of which I had never seen &#8230; and unfortunately still haven&#8217;t. From the Behemoth, I got my only good look at it. I had hoped to see it later that evening, in operation, but we never traveled further north than Treasure Island.<br />
We rounded the next corner and turned onto Main Street to head south. (In this area of Vegas there seemed to be several one-way roads.) Las Vegas Boulevard just a bit past Circus Circus became one-way northbound at the intersection of Main Street, Las Vegas Boulevard, and Paradise Road (Main Street became Paradise Road).<br />
On the way back, we decided to kill more time by finding out what Caesar&#8217;s Palace was like. Since we weren&#8217;t staying there, a browse through the establishment seemed like a good idea. We arrived at Caesar&#8217;s a few minutes later and entered the same driveway we entered about a half hour earlier. But this time we turned right at the fork in the road and went around the Omnimax dome towards the rear parking lot. Stefan grumbled about not being able to see a good Omnimax movie, I looked in surprise at the valet parking for the eager shoppers of the Forum Shops. (I mean, when is it too much? Valet parking to use the bathroom?)<br />
For such a large and popular enterprise, Caesar&#8217;s Palace had an awfully small parking lot. But fortunately not everyone drives, so we managed to find a parking spot without too much effort. We had to crack the roof vent, turn the fan on, and draw all the curtains to keep the van from getting too warm. Outside the temperature was probably in excess of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), but to be totally honest, we really didn&#8217;t notice.<br />
In southern Ontario we border on Lake Ontario. Its 19,011 square kilometres have this unusual effect of keeping temperatures within about two to three kilometres of the lake relatively smooth &#8212; no hideous spikes or dips. Unfortunately, its 19,011 square kilometres also provide a great deal of humidity. The &#8220;dog-days&#8221; of summer have particular meaning there, especially the days when the humidity hits 100% without the hope of rain. Even a normally comfortable 26 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) becomes unbearable.<br />
Nevada has the distinction of being the driest state in the Union. The humidity that day couldn&#8217;t have even come close to approaching double digits. It was nearly impossible to dampen a shirt from perspiration &#8212; it would evaporate almost immediately. In a way, that kind of climate is good to have from time to time, it&#8217;s a cleansing kind of climate, in a dry-cleaning sort of way.<br />
We entered the Forum Shops through the lower level, at the valet parking entrance. (The Forum had no rear access for some unknown reason.) The escalator deposited us at one end of the mall, looking into the casino. On our left was the Warner Brothers store, which we left for last. It was time to see how the rich shopped, and realize just how poor we were.<br />
The general premise behind Forum Shops at Caesar&#8217;s Palace seemed to get back all the money the gambler won at the casino. There was no such thing as a cheap or inexpensive item in the whole place. It was like an upscale Neiman-Marcus, a hip Sharper Image, a trendy Rodeo Drive (with a ceiling). And of course the whole motif was Classical Roman. After all, Caesar wouldn&#8217;t approve if it looked like any other mall.<br />
The design of the mall was reasonable simple &#8212; a single hallway that bent in two places. At each of the bends there were large fountains. The ceiling covering the hallway was painted to resemble the sky, and included variable lights that changed colour to show the changing hours of the day. The first fountain was immense, containing several sculptures of Roman gods and a Pegasus with wings spread.<br />
The second fountain was a little more interesting though. We arrived at the end of an hourly laser light show at the fountain. Everyone seemed enthralled with the presentation, but we saw too little of the show to really know what it was about. We made indefinite plans to see it an hour later, at 14:00. More on that later&#8230;<br />
Almost as soon as the crowd started dispersing from the show we narrowly missed, Dhar ducked into a sunglass store to purchase a hard case for his glasses. I contemplated buying a new pair of glasses to complement the ones I regularly wore (which were really ugly), but after a quick view of the selection, I decided against it. In hindsight, I wish I had bought new glasses since I could&#8217;ve used opinions from Rebecca, Dhar, and Stefan to help me make up my mind. Being fashionably challenged, I have always had a great deal of trouble in picking something that looked good on me. What I though looked good other would think was horrible.<br />
Another store that caught our fancy was a magic store, on the other side of the second fountain chamber on the same side as the sunglass store. I have always been interested in magic tricks, but mostly in figuring out how they&#8217;re done. The salesmen were truly gifted in their craft, perhaps retired magicians themselves &#8212; they demonstrated their wares with such skill and finesse that I was left completely stumped. Even something as simple as making a small ball magically pass through solid copper cups (a sleight-of-hand trick) had me dying to know how it was done. As much as I wanted to buy some of the tricks to learn them for myself, I decided that I&#8217;d just wait until I found someone who could teach me. Rebecca was tempted to get a trick for Eric to learn. I was tempted to tell her to learn how to make Eric disappear. (Not that I dislike the kid &#8212; Eric was the first kid I actually liked, probably because he reminds me of when I was a little kid.)<br />
Disney had a fair stake in their store, right up to the Roman style sculpture of Mickey Mouse over the store entrance. The floor of the entrance was also noteworthy &#8212; several hundred tiny lights were embedded in the plastic, wood, and concrete walkway, that glowed in patterns that cycled about every five minutes or so. The merchandise inside was nothing particularly special, I could find it at just about any franchise store. The main exception were the shirts made exclusively for the store in Forum Shops, bearing the names and logos of the Forum Shops and Caesar&#8217;s Palace.<br />
We popped in and out of stores on our way down the hall until we reached the end of the line: a set of stairs going down. These led into the &#8220;kids&#8221; area of the mall, consisting of a virtual reality theatre and a video arcade. We forwent with the virtual reality and concentrated on the video games. Like any well-managed arcade, all the recent and popular games were near the doorway, the rest were placed towards the rear in decreasing order of income.<br />
That was the first time I heard of (or took notice of) Namco, a seemingly major player in the billion dollar video game industry. Namco&#8217;s flagship game, at least at this arcade, was a first-person light gun shoot-&#8217;em-up. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t remember the name. (I found the game some months later, it&#8217;s called Time Crisis.) The graphics and the movement of the characters and the screen images was nothing short of awesome. Someone had taken a great deal of time to make the polygon rendering subsystem blindingly quick and smooth. I wanted to peel the cover off to see if there was a Silicon Graphics workstation embedded in the immense box.<br />
We stopped in a hologram store that had some laser art I had never seen before. (The general premise behind holograms is fairly elementary (at least when you compare it to quantum mechanics), a pure light source (i.e. a laser beam) is split and the two separate beams bounced of an object. The interference patterns of the two bounced beams (that is, the intersecting wave patterns) then hit a photographic plate where the interference patterns encode a three dimensional image.)<br />
But most holograms are static &#8212; that is to say when you move from side to side, or up an down, the object in the image appears stationary. Several of the holograms we saw used a totally new technique that allowed a mini-movie to be made: dancing ballerinas, moving animals, even a stripper (this was, after all, Las Vegas). I could tell that I was not alone in trying to understand how to make something like that, but I was getting about as far as Stefan and Dhar in deciphering the mystery.<br />
When we returned to the second fountain, almost an hour had passed. Still having about ten or so minutes before the next show, we ducked into a sports store in search of sandals. Dhar always wore his jeans (for some strange reason &#8212; even in New Orleans, where it was hot and humid, he couldn&#8217;t be convinced that shorts might be more apropos), but wanted his feet to be cool (his sneakers were obviously warm). At least he did recognize that sandals were more comfortable than shoes in the heat, and he wanted to buy a pair as soon as possible.<br />
The selection in the store was slim, and the prices fat. Stefan remarked that he could buy the same shoes in Canada for exactly the same price &#8212; not taking currency conversion into account. The Forum Shops were definitely not meant for the price-conscientious. In other words, Students need not apply.<br />
The dry air, combined with a fairly physical trip through the mall combined to make the lot of us very thirsty. Luckily for us there was a restaurant and deli right next to where we were standing. But getting into either meant a 15-20 minute wait. Thirst does not wait. We found a &#8220;drink bar&#8221; that extended from the deli. It was like every other store in the Forum Shops &#8212; expensive. A soft drink (i.e. Coca Cola) cost over $3.00, and had too much ice for my liking. But it was a fluid, and dehydration wasn&#8217;t big on my list of things to experience that day.<br />
No sooner than we purchased our drinks that the show began. (I said I&#8217;d get back to this.) Allow me to set the stage: the fountain sat in the middle of a large rotunda about 150 feet across and about 50 feet high. About 35-40 feet up the walls were all the effects devices: lasers, mirrors, projectors, smoke machines and so forth. On the opposite side of the rotunda was a small window for the show operator. In the fountain itself was the focal point of the show: the statutes.<br />
Statues you say? How can statues be a show? Riddle me this, fair reader: When is a statue not a statue? When it&#8217;s an expensive piece of animatronics. (Remember folks, we&#8217;re still in Las Vegas.) The centrepiece of the fountain was a set of four statues: a ring of three standing figures, two male and one female; a fourth and much larger (not only in size, but in girth) male figure sat in a large chair in the very centre, but raised above the other three statues. The outer three statues were to represent Venus, Mars and Mercury (unless I&#8217;ve gotten my gods confused). The centre statue was either Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry (and the patron saint of university students) or a rather fat Julius Caesar. I was never too sure which.<br />
At first glance the statues looked like ordinary marble. Until they started moving, that is. And I don&#8217;t mean just twirling around like a music box dancer &#8212; I mean moving. The centre statue would yawn and stretch, the feet would shift slightly, even the body would adjust its position in the chair. And of course, it would speak, jowls a-flapping. The mere production of the show lost all meaning for myself, and probably Stefan and Dhar as well &#8212; we were too keen on knowing how the contraption worked.<br />
This was not just some thrown together rubber, pneumatic, electronic piece of showmanship one would expect for Las Vegas. This was worthy of top-notch Hollywood effects. The movements were fluid and precise, appearing to be completely organic. (Take a look at how an assembly line robotic arm moves and compare that to how a human arm moves &#8212; they are very different motions.) Even the lip-syncing was well done &#8230; at least when I could hear the voices. (For all the money Caesar&#8217;s Palace pumped into the display, they could&#8217;ve at least put in a more effective sound system.)<br />
Although I didn&#8217;t catch all the words (I was more enthralled with the technical aspect of the show), the gist of it was essentially a grabber to get you to go into the casino. Okay, they didn&#8217;t directly mention the casino, but why else would you go to Caesar&#8217;s Palace in the first place? Yes, they could&#8217;ve put the gist of the show on a billboard, but then it just wouldn&#8217;t be as flashy. Las Vegas is a service-oriented city, and advertisement is the key to delivering that service.<br />
When the show ended, I took the opportunity to disappear for a few minutes into a memorabilia shop containing some of the most unusual things I had ever seen. Aside from the typical autographed movie posters and record albums, there were also hats, toy cars, antique gas pumps, an original plastic Ronald McDonald to place on park benches &#8230; so much stuff there was hardly any room to walk. I left after a short stay &#8212; I began to feel like the proverbial bull in a china shop.<br />
But nothing was as impressive as the gadget store. It almost resembled the commercial end of the fictional Q Branch of James Bond fame. I almost expected to see a grey Astin-Martin DB5 parked in the corner complete with the ejection seat. Actually, it would more likely have been the BMW from Goldeneye &#8212; the Astin-Martin would&#8217;ve been more appropriate in the memorabilia shop &#8230; if there was room to store it.<br />
Tools, clocks, digital barbeques, pool accessories, maps, lights, radios &#8230; you name it, they probably had it. One of the neatest pieces I saw was, of all things, a keychain. It was an ingenious device: a disc about an inch diametre and about a quarter inch thick. Around the side of the disc was a groove in which a half dozen individual rings could spin around the disc. A small button in the centre of the disc released a little catch opening a gap in the groove, allowing the rings to be removed. I can&#8217;t tell you how close I came to buying it, the number of times I&#8217;ve needed to remove a key from my keychain is unthinkable. However, the price they wanted for the simple device was equally unthinkable &#8230; $30.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan found their perfect product there too &#8230; a massage chair. Remember that episode of The Simpsons where Homer finds the ultimate in relaxation chairs, one that vibrates so much he begins to feel like Dave Bowman as he entered the monolith in 2001? Well, this one didn&#8217;t vibrate, but it had a very similar effect on Rebecca &#8212; she was flushed from only five minutes of use.<br />
We spent a disproportionate amount of time perusing the store, and after at least a half hour of window shopping, we mustered up enough will power to drag ourselves from the store (most of the energy was used in convincing Rebecca to get out of the chair). That chair cost $4,000. I was informed several times that if Stefan and Rebecca won enough money, we would be bringing it back with us. I wondered if we could con the border guards by getting them to sit in the chair and massage them into submission.<br />
The next stop was at Victoria&#8217;s Secret. The mail order catalogue of men&#8217;s fantasies had a retail store in the Forum Shops. Dhar and I elected to stay outside while Stefan and Rebecca went it. It&#8217;s not that I get embarrassed, it&#8217;s just that I didn&#8217;t even want to think about watching anyone trying on lingerie unless I knew that person really well and I was dating (or married to) said person. Going in there would have been like making a chocolate mousse cake, and then not eating any.<br />
Have I mentioned yet that Dhar was shutter-happy? I didn&#8217;t think so. (How&#8217;d I forget that?) He never stopped taking pictures. I think the only time he did was when he was changing rolls of film. Although I will admit that I did come close to using as many rolls of film as Dhar, I didn&#8217;t take as many people pictures as he did. Dhar would take pictures whenever he felt most like being a pain in the ass. I will admit that it bugged me, but in retrospect I relate to his habit. On previous excursions I had been known to be even worse, and I earned a reputation for being a total asshole for some of the pictures I took.<br />
Our last stop in the mall was in the Warner Brothers store. This was my doing. My friend Scott had several years before gone to a Warner Brothers store in Buffalo, New York and returned with an Animaniacs baseball cap. I will immediately admit I was jealous, the both of us were fans of the cartoon and of Amblin Entertainment, those responsible for the animated mayhem. I was hoping to find something in the store that interested me enough to get possible revenge (in a non-spiteful manner). Alas, the store simply wasn&#8217;t stocked with particularly unique items and those that did interest me carried a rather high sticker shock.<br />
By this time it was about 15:00 and we decided it was time to head over to Treasure Island and deposit most of our junk in a hotel room so we could explore more of The Strip. Down the escalator and out the valet entrance and back to the parking lot we went. On the way Dhar tried to use up the rest of his film by taking a picture of Rebecca in a &#8220;provocative and sexy&#8221; pose. For a woman who knows a great deal (and possibly too much) about sex, she can&#8217;t pose worth a damn. One reason why Rebecca isn&#8217;t a model&#8230;<br />
The drawn curtains and the ceiling fan did their jobs, the van was not uncomfortably warm. Stefan drove us back out under the Forum Shops, by the valet entrance and out to Las Vegas Boulevard, where we had entered over two hours earlier. We traveled north on Las Vegas Boulevard for approximately a kilometre and turned left onto Buccaneer Boulevard, which was actually Treasure Island&#8217;s driveway. Stefan pulled into the taxi and valet drop off area, Rebecca and I hopped out and went in to register.<br />
Again the sudden shift from medium noise to tremendous clamor was unsettling. But Treasure Island didn&#8217;t seem to be as loud as Caesar&#8217;s Palace &#8230; different slots perhaps, or I was getting used to the sound (stage two of Lasvegasitis was likely setting in). We found the registration desk and presented myself to a gentleman by the name of Leland, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. (The only reason I remembered the name was because it&#8217;s a rare one, I&#8217;ve only ever heard it once before &#8212; in the movie Toys.)<br />
I gave him my credit card, he double checked that I knew the hotel room was costing some $350.00 (American funds, but including taxes). Although I didn&#8217;t see Rebecca&#8217;s face when Leland read of the price, I swear I heard her gasp quietly. I cursed to myself, I had hoped no-one would find out how much one of these rooms cost per night. I signed a few forms, then Leland asked me for the names of the others. I assumed this was in case one of us lost our key, we could report to the registration desk and get a new one.<br />
The keys were of the newer swipe cards, much like a bank machine card or a credit card. The card is inserted into the lock, pulled out and providing you 1) haven&#8217;t somehow buggered up the magnetic strip, or 2) accidentally gone to the wrong room, the lock clicked open and you walked in. Leland let us know that the room was still being cleaned but that we could go up and drop our stuff off.<br />
Stefan and Dhar were waiting up the curb from the taxi stop. We climbed in and continued down the road to find the parking lots. Immediately we were confronted with a small problem: the Behemoth wouldn&#8217;t fit into the standard parking garages. One of the garages had a clearance of eight feet, four inches &#8212; one inch higher than us &#8212; but the lack of safe distance convinced us to find the oversized lot. This was so far back we could almost have as easily walked from the Forum Shops.<br />
We grabbed our bags, clothes, cameras, and some of the valuables (one can never be too careful about security), cracked the ceiling vent and turned on the fan, opened a couple windows (barely large enough to put a child&#8217;s arm through) and headed back to the main entrance. The intense heat of southern Nevada finally hit us, but only because we were carrying heavy loads.<br />
I honestly wish I could&#8217;ve seen some of the reactions of the casino patrons as we tramped into the hotel. Like most of the resorts, the casino was the centrepiece. To get to the hotel elevators you had to go through the casino floor; to get to the restaurants you had to go through the casino floor; to get to the shows or any of the stores you had to go through the casino floor. Although a large number of the people on the floor were tourists, and not dressed particularly nicely, we were outfitted with t-shirts, cut-off jeans, baseball caps, and large hiking backpacks. (And even if no-one noticed there, we definitely attracted attention when we checked into our hotel in New Orleans.)<br />
Fortunately, the casino wasn&#8217;t a terribly large one, and the slot machines took up the vast majority of the available space. Only about two hundred square metres was devoted to the other games (blackjack, craps, roulette, et cetera) &#8230; out of the approximately 30,000 square metres of casino floor space. For what it lacked in size it made up in business &#8212; it seemed to keep a regular flow of people in and out.<br />
Two sets of elevators ferried guests to their rooms. One set took you no higher than the 14th floor. The other set was for floors above 14. It took us a moment to realize this, even though we caught the right set of elevators on the first try.<br />
When we reached the 16th floor, we looked around for a sign that might indicate our room. Treasure Island was built in a &#8216;Y&#8217; shape, the &#8216;V&#8217; portion of the &#8216;Y&#8217; shape faced Las Vegas Boulevard, the tail stuck out back. A small dark brown sign with white lettering indicated four directions to travel in: right, centre, left and Suite 1620. It&#8217;s amazing how important you suddenly feel when it&#8217;s necessary to list your room separately from the rest of the lesser rooms.<br />
The double doors were open, a cleaning cart indicated that the room was still being cleaned. I had hoped that when I had made the reservation the staff might move a tad quicker and make arrangements to have the room ready when we arrived. We knocked once and cautiously entered the room. I had to bite my tongue when I heard the Hispanic maid emerge from one of the bathrooms speaking broken English. I had always assumed that kind of character was strictly stereotypical for Hollywood, I never expected to actually see something like that.<br />
The maid asked me for my door key, which she indicated I should check in the door. The door lock is a simple device: a small brass box about 10 centimetres wide, 20 centimetres long and sticking about two to three centimetres out of the door. At the bottom of the box was a thin black slot into which the card is inserted. Above the slot is a red light and a green light. Assuming the card is valid, the green light winks on a second or two after inserting and removing the card from the slot.<br />
I have been in many hotel rooms in my life, varying from comfortable to roach infested. But never had I ever come close to having a hotel room like this. The double doors led to a short hallway about 10 metres in length and four metres wide. About two thirds of the way down the hallway were two sets of double doors, one on each side, both leading to washrooms. The hallway opened into a large room, about eight metres in width and 15 metres long. Across from the hallway was a window sans openings. I was disappointed that there was no balcony, but as Stefan pointed out that oversight probably saved a lot of would-be jumpers.<br />
The &#8220;His&#8221; washroom (on the left, looking into the suite from the main doors) was very spacious: roughly 25-30 metres square. At the back left corner was a toilet (and just in front of the toilet was a phone), and the back right corner sported a shower. In the centre was a very wide-countered sink and mirror. A closet could be found just left of the washroom door, complete with safe (to which we didn&#8217;t have the combination). The floors were tiled, as were the walls in the shower.<br />
The &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom (on the right, looking into the suite from the main doors) was a mirror image of the &#8220;His&#8221; washroom with two notable exceptions. First, the toilet was in the front left corner of the washroom. Secondly, there was a whirlpool bathtub in the back left corner. It was not hot tub, but it would fill our needs &#8230; rather, Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s needs.<br />
The main room was sparsely furnished. On the left side of the room (looking into the suite from the main doors) was a king size bed, two night tables with lamps, and a large chest at the foot of the bed. On the right side of the room was a chesterfield, a chair, a low coffee table, a cabinet and a TV. All the furniture was white in colour finished with gold-coloured trim. (The woodwork had gold paint; the chairs, chesterfield, and bed had thin gold-coloured rope with tassels.)<br />
We marveled at the room for a few minutes, then decided to figure out what it was we were going to do. One of the first things on the agenda were showers and baths, since we wanted to go out to dinner before engaging in anything else. But first, we watched a little TV (much to my chagrin &#8212; I had hoped to avoid TV for the entire trip). We found the second TV in the chest at the foot of the bed, pressing a button similar to a garage door opener caused the TV to rise majestically from the inside.<br />
We quickly found out where our gas woes had come from &#8212; gas prices across the United States had jumped between five and 10 cents a gallon in the past few days. Some places hadn&#8217;t been drastically affected, but parts of California were asking $2.20 a gallon. We were suddenly relieved that California had been cut from the travel plan some weeks earlier.<br />
A couple channels were dedicated to broadcasting Las Vegas-related programming. One channel in particular was from Treasure Island itself, and continually played a movie about a kid&#8217;s adventure at the resort. Gambling was restricted to those 18 years of age or older, so the movie had likely been produced to get the kids excited about other things to do. From a critical point of view, it was entirely commercial but with enough Hollywood flair to make it passable for its intended audiences, namely kids.<br />
Rebecca turned to the whirlpool a little while later. It was then she made a rather odd request of me. I was asked to take a picture of her, but only after she deemed it okay for me to go in. I continued to vegetate in front of the TV over by the chesterfield until I heard her melodious voice call from the &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom. I was joined by Stefan at this call.<br />
There was Rebecca, seated in the middle of a sea of foam, the rose tattoo on her left shoulder standing out on her milky-white skin, and a huge grin crossing her face. I guessed that Rebecca had never been in such a place before and wanted to show off the things she got to do during the trip. I pulled out the camera, made a couple of adjustments to the focus and exposure settings, and promptly screwed up the first picture by forgetting to turn the flash on. The second picture ended up much more flattering, but gained a strange bluish tint to which I have yet to find a cause. No sooner than I had returned to the chair I had been sitting in to put the camera back in its bag than Stefan disappeared into the &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom, locking the door behind him.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan didn&#8217;t spend too long alone, emerging only about 20 minutes later. Dhar disappeared into the &#8220;His&#8221; bathroom for his shower. The remaining three of us began to discuss the events of the evening. Dhar had decided not to see one of the famous Vegas shows that night, he was more intent on seeing The Strip. On a suggestion from Rebecca, the Cirque du Soleil show, Mystére, became our primary focus on the itinerary.<br />
When Rebecca began to make preparations for the tickets, I promptly announced I was taking my shower (Dhar having completed his), and marched into the &#8220;His&#8221; bathroom. I was ecstatic to find that the Mirage (builder, owner, and operator of Treasure Island) hadn&#8217;t skimped on much of anything, putting in some of the best showers I had ever used. The free toiletries were no hell, but they seldom are.</p>

<em>Day 5</em><br />
Vegas along &#8216;The Strip&#8217; is nothing short of breath-taking. [Mostly due to the automobile exhaust.] I knew that this was going to be a great experience, so I took the liberty of getting us a room downtown at Treasure Island. Expensive, but it&#8217;s the experience that counts.<br />
Caesar&#8217;s Palace is an adult&#8217;s playground, and I suspect that the rest of The Strip isn&#8217;t much different.<br />
It&#8217;s going to be a long night&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea was to have brought &#8220;good&#8221; clothes with us so that we could all go out to a good restaurant and eat a good meal. However, my interpretation of Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s idea of &#8220;good&#8221; clothes wasn&#8217;t quite correct. Taking an assumption that experienced campers would bring clothes that would be acceptable in most places as &#8220;nice&#8221;, I brought along clothes I could pack away that wouldn&#8217;t be damaged by creasing. Unfortunately, what they brought I considered to be in the &#8220;business casual&#8221; category. I suddenly felt very underdressed.<br />
Dhar was the most dapper of the three men, but he wasn&#8217;t going to join us for dinner. For some reason, he was more inclined to eat on his own and explore the city that is Las Vegas. Our reservations for Cirque du Soleil were for 19:30, with recommendations to arrive at 19:00 to make sure we could get in. This meant we had to go for dinner at 18:00 so we could get in on time. Dhar left for his evening romp just before we went downstairs.<br />
Of the half-dozen or so restaurants in Treasure Island, my attire excluded us from the two upscale establishments. We ended up at the third fanciest restaurant, just up the hall from the Cirque du Soleil&#8217;s theatre and across the hall from the shops. On arrival we found a fairly long line to wait through. It took about 15 minutes before we were seated at a table.<br />
The interior of the restaurant was made to look like an outdoors Caribbean plaza: the walls were made to look like plaster-covered brick, complete with cracks and missing pieces. Fake windows and the odd closed balcony added to the illusion. The tables and chairs were made from wrought iron, an interesting choice for furniture, but again fitting to the atmosphere.<br />
The menu was nothing elaborate, offering meals from a variety of tastes including Italian, seafood, Cajun, Mexican, and traditional American. All three of us decided upon pasta dishes: I had a hot Italian sausage penne, Stefan originally was going to have the same but switched to something else, and Rebecca had a seafood linguine &#8230; shrimp, I believe. We also had a nice red wine to go along with the meal.<br />
By the time we finished it was almost 19:00, and I was a slightly inebriated. I had drank a little more wine than Rebecca, and certainly much faster. Not to mention my alcoholic tolerance was significantly lower. Fortunately my meal allowed me to metabolize the wine fairly swiftly and within about a half hour I was sober.<br />
The tickets to the show were over $60 apiece. I was a little taken aback at the price, but our seats were third row centre. I remarked on Rebecca&#8217;s ability to get such good seats on such short notice. The tickets were expensive, but as I would soon find out, well worth the price. I wanted to pay Rebecca back for the cost of the ticket (she had purchased the tickets on her VISA card while I had been in the shower), but I was countered with a negative response &#8212; I pay for the room, they paid for the tickets. The wine, not yet worn off, prevented me from arguing the point any further.<br />
Based in Montreal, the Cirque du Soleil ( &#8220;Circus of the Sun&#8221;) company runs several troupes that tour the globe at any given time. The troupe at Treasure Island however, was as permanent as their facility. I had seen a Cirque du Soleil performance in Quebec City in 1986, and a spin-off company of former Cirque du Soleil members a couple years later &#8212; both were in large circus-style tents. Even a quick glance around the room told you that Cirque du Soleil had the facility built to their specifications.<br />
The seating was arranged in a nearly perfect semi-circle, divided into a lower section and an upper section. The lower section had about 15 rows of seats, the upper section about 20 to 30. All were cushioned folding seats with drink holders in the armrests. This was a far cry from the scaffolding benches I had sat on in performances of years past.<br />
The stage was an impressive sight. It was arranged in a kind of thrust stage arrangement more at home in proper stage drama theatres. The &#8220;thrust&#8221; portion of the stage started at the curve in the semi-circle of seats and extended back towards the main portion of the stage. The thrust portion was about 10 metres wide and 15 metres deep. The main portion of the state ran back a further 15 to 20 metres and was at least 50 to 60 metres wide (including the invisible wings). On either side of the stage were towers that ran from the walls to about a quarter of the distance into the stage area. A third of the way up the towers were places for the musicians.<br />
I thought it a bit strange to have live music at a performance such as this. The Cirque du Soleil wasn&#8217;t a true circus in the sense there were no animals &#8212; at least if you considered all the performers human. The performance was completely scripted and timed &#8212; specific events happened at specific times, and humans could be relied upon to stick to those cues. A simple pre-recorded sound track should suffice. As I would later learn, there was a reason for live music.<br />
A commotion and low murmuring behind us caused us to turn around &#8230; curiousity is a hard thing to ignore. A well-endowed woman in a white skin-tight dress (ending about six inches down her thighs) had entered the room. I immediately wondered how much she had paid to get her bosom to look the way it did. Then I noticed the reason for the murmuring: it wasn&#8217;t the woman, it was the clown following her, ogling her every move.<br />
I had forgotten about the clowns. Like the company they worked for, some of the clowns weren&#8217;t clowns in the true sense. This one looked like Albert Einstein on a bad hair day, wearing clothes more suited to an orchestra conductor but looking like he&#8217;d slept in them for a week. The only make-up he wore was rouge on his nose to make it look bright red. Like in performances past, he was the designated shit-disturber.<br />
He would walk to the entrance, and &#8220;help&#8221; people to their seats. This usually involved leading them to an entirely different place of the seating area than the ticket indicated, and even onto the stage. If the patron happened to be carrying food (usually popcorn), he would take the bag and start eating, spilling, throwing, or giving it away. Eventually one of the people he led behind stage &#8220;threw&#8221; him out of the theatre. It wasn&#8217;t the last time we saw him during the performance.<br />
The show began with a sudden explosion. The thrust portion of the stage and part of the main stage were comprised of four hydraulic lifts that went down about five metres below the level of the stage. When we arrived, the hole left behind bubbled with smoke. When the show started, that smoke concealed the first chapter of the show.<br />
Kodo is a Japanese art, usually several men and women drumming rhythmically on tom-toms of various sizes and usually on at least one huge double-drum. Some of the cast of Cirque du Soleil learned Kodo &#8230; they learned it well. I had never actually seen it before, and I was immediately blown away by the sound they made.<br />
The sound seemed to come from all around, much like a good home entertainment system generates high quality surround sound. But I quickly realized that in addition to the dozen or so drummers on the lifting stage, there were also four drummers being lowered from the ceiling along the semi-circular path leading to the audience seating. I had to admit, that was the best entrance I had ever seen.<br />
Now I&#8217;m not going to tell you everything I saw, and there&#8217;s good reasons for this. First, I honestly don&#8217;t remember everything I saw or in what order I saw it. Secondly, this was the kind of show you really need to see for yourself. If you&#8217;re reading this some many years from now, long after Treasure Island has closed (or been destroyed), I realize that this simply will frustrate you, and I apologize. But I can no more describe the awesome skill of these performers any more than I can tell you exactly what the Grand Canyon looks like, or the boredom experienced crossing Kansas.<br />
One portion of the show in particular that stuck with me for its sheer beauty was the balancing act. This was two men, both totally hairless, wearing very small bikini briefs, and completely covered with white powder. One of them would take hold of the other, bending outwards. The other would bend in a different direction to counter the weight. One such impressive example was when they formed a straight line about eight feet long, only one of them with his feet on the ground.<br />
Their motions were totally fluid, the positions they held requiring the utmost strength, agility, and flexibility. The act was so beautifully done, I even had to nudge Rebecca and ask her if I was the only one who thought the scene was very sexual. I wasn&#8217;t alone, but I wasn&#8217;t as excited as Rebecca, who had to fan herself at the end of the sequence.<br />
The trapeze act supplied me with the reason for live music. The trapeze was a group of ten people suspended in a rectangular box about 15 metres in length. The box was divided into eighths, with the fourth and fifth sections forming a single block. Below the second and seventh eighths were swings. At each of the lines dividing the eighths were horizontal bars around which the performers would swing, catapulting themselves around the length of the box. The performers on the swings would periodically catch one of the other performers leaping from another part of the frame, or would fling a performer to the other side.<br />
At one point in the show, one of the performers was getting ready to execute what looked like a flip. He swung around the bar between the third and fourth sections, and built up a great deal of momentum. Whether he lost his grip or let go too early I couldn&#8217;t tell, but the next thing he knew, he shot right into the swing mounted below the second section. It was a fairly stiff impact, and it was obvious that he was hurt.<br />
If MystÃ¯ ¿ ½re had a linear sound track, played from a CD or a master tape, the cues would had to have been so precise that no errors could have ever been committed during any of the performances. When the trapeze accident occurred, there was a pause of about twenty to thirty seconds before anyone moved. But the band played on. Stefan and I debated whether or not the act was cut short as a result of the accident, but by the musical score being played, you really couldn&#8217;t tell.<br />
The show ended almost the same way it started, with Kodo. This time the music was much longer and had more bold patterning of the beats than at the beginning of the show. This was due in part to the addition of another performer who seemed to be well-gifted with Kodo. With a few final echoing beats, the show ended, the cast and musicians took their bows, and we headed towards the exits.<br />
On the way out, Rebecca and I stopped to purchase copies of MystÃ¯ ¿ ½re&#8217;s soundtrack from the Cirque du Soleil shop, next to the snack bar of the theatre. It wasn&#8217;t a cheap purchase, but when you&#8217;ve heard the music, you really don&#8217;t mind so much.<br />
After forcing our way through an ocean of slow-moving show-goers, we headed back to our hotel room if for nothing else than to drop off our purchases. I also wanted to grab my camera before continuing with our grand plan for the evening: to tour The Strip and see all that we could see. The idea was to keep wandering until we either got bored or became exhausted (though if you want my honest opinion, it&#8217;s pretty damn difficult to get bored in Vegas if you&#8217;re only there a couple of days.)<br />
Dhar was lying on the bed when we came in. If his hair had been any longer, it might have been standing on end, he looked that frayed. Apparently the three and a half hours he had been on his own had been quite interesting. First off, he didn&#8217;t have dinner alone. Finding his way to an unnamed restaurant in the area, he found himself accompanying some woman (with an undisclosed appearance) who had been stood up for a dinner date. Following Dhar&#8217;s insistence that nothing else transpired with this mysterious woman, he proceeded to wander up and down The Strip.<br />
And Dhar got into trouble. Again. Dhar was very good at this, he seldom needed to try. According to our illustrious travel partner, he was out taking pictures of some of the huge neon and incandescent signs that litter either side of The Strip, and walked into a vacant lot to get a clear shot of The Dunes (I think &#8230; I may remember the hotel&#8217;s name incorrectly). No sooner than Dhar took the picture that a car sped into the lot and a couple very large burly men charged at him. Dhar didn&#8217;t bother to hang around and find out what they wanted.<br />
The four members of our Mission Impossible Force reassembled, we engaged in yet another riveting debate as what to occupy ourselves with. Stefan decided to make use of the washroom and change into something a little more casual. Dhar continued to lie on the bed, doubly worn out from his escapades of the evening and his lack of sleep from the night before. Rebecca and I stared out the window overlooking Buccaneer Bay, a reoccurring recreation of a ship battle, performed every 90 minutes during the evenings.<br />
In the smaller of the two pools, on the left side (as a spectator would view it from the sidewalk) was the &#8220;pirate&#8221; ship. It was about 30 metres long, the deck about five metres above the water, masts extending 30 or so metres into the air. Over all it was a fairly impressive looking vessel. It was a shame that it would never float on its own. The water in the pool wasn&#8217;t very deep, and it was obvious that the ship was attached to the bottom of the pool &#8212; it didn&#8217;t bob in the water at all.<br />
At the very right side of the pool was a very narrow channel, running about 50 metres down the edge of the sidewalk to the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Spring Mountain Road. This was where the Britannia (the English ship) resided. It was equally impressive in design, but we didn&#8217;t get a good look at it until it rounded the corner and came into the pool during the show.<br />
By about 17:50, the crowd had formed firmly, and it was becoming very hard to move around. I couldn&#8217;t help think that this gathering constituted a safety risk of some kind &#8212; getting emergency health services through the throng would be a near impossibility. And there was no sign of either Dhar or Stefan. We were wondering if we could hold places for them any longer.<br />
Then Rebecca caught sight of her mate through the herd. It never ceases to amaze me how women (particularly those with significant others) can do that. It took me a great deal of concentration and a few moving people before I figured out where they were. Rebecca started shouting to Stefan, trying to attract his attention. For some reason, Stefan never once looked in our direction, nor did Dhar. Not wanting to have to hunt over hell and half-of-creation to find them after the show, I decided to risk minor embarrassment and attract their attention by the best way I knew how: volume.<br />
If there is but one gift I received from my father, it was being loud. I seem to have a naturally loud voice. It may not carry too far, but I frequently get asked to quiet down. (This was most noticeable when I was in elementary school.) I cupped my hands around my mouth, breathed deeply, and bellowed: &#8220;STEFAN!&#8221; For a brief moment, just about everyone on the sidewalk waiting for the show to start fell silent. Everyone wanted to know who the hell this Stefan character was. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel somewhat smug &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t attracted that much attention since I was in Grade 5. (My teacher humiliated me in front of my class when, in my boredom, I played &#8220;rocket ship&#8221; with my face.)<br />
Dhar didn&#8217;t stick around long though. We learned that Dhar hates crowds. And I don&#8217;t mean that he has a dislike for them &#8212; he really anathematizes them. His eyes looked wild, like he was having trouble breathing (he probably was). His voice wavered ever so slightly, like someone who could feel the walls closing in on him (he probably could). Before he got trapped in the living sardine can, he headed south (in the direction of the Mirage) to wait for the show to end.<br />
A loud fanfare about five minutes later announced the show&#8217;s start. The Britannia &#8220;sailed&#8221; down the channel and entered Buccaneer Bay, interrupting the pirate crew as they attempted to unload their stolen booty. A slight argument ensued where the captain of the Britannia attempted to order the pirates to surrender, to which the pirates politely refused by firing a cannon at the Britannia.<br />
At this point an all-out fire-fight began. Parts of either ship were blown up, apart, or off, and various part of the surrounding decor suffered slight to serious damage. (At one point, a tremendous butane-powered fireball erupts from one of the upper-level &#8220;buildings&#8221;.) The parts that fall apart were collapsible, and easily reassembled for the next showing.<br />
The sequence ends when the pirates, in a last-ditch attempt to save their scurvy hides, blow a &#8220;hole&#8221; in the side of the Britannia, which starts listing to port and sinks into Buccaneer Bay. The engineering that went into the Britannia was impressive: not only did the gantry on which the ship &#8220;sails&#8221; into the bay have to contend with corners, but it had to tilt the huge vessel into the bay, then raise it back up (undoubtedly full of water).<br />
The show ended with the Vegas clichÃ¯ ¿ ½: you&#8217;ve seen our show, now come in and lose your money. Okay, it&#8217;s not that blatant, but the principle is the same. Not surprisingly though, few took up the offer and went in (unless they were staying there). Most decided to go in the same direction we wanted to go &#8212; south, towards Dhar. The sheer number of people made it difficult to move, and even more difficult to find Dhar.<br />
We passed by the Imperial Palace, the Flamingo Hilton, and the Barbary Coast resorts before arriving at Flamingo Road. Along the way, Dhar and I took several pictures of the various resorts on both sides of The Strip, including the Mirage hotel and Caesar&#8217;s Palace. Dhar had already taken several pictures of The Strip (he claimed to have walked up and down it three times before going out with us), but that didn&#8217;t stop him from taking some additional, albeit strange, pictures. (One was taken outside Imperial Palace, looking right up the side of what appeared to be a paddlewheel &#8212; the entire facade was like a Mississippi steamboat.)<br />
The seedy side of Las Vegas began to show through. During the day the strong cleansing rays of the sun drive the scum and cockroaches into the shadows, you hardly ever see them. But at night the roads are lined with the dregs of society: drunkards (though many could have been tourists &#8212; only in Vegas do the drunkards dress well), beggars (many appeared to be ex-tourists who lost their proverbial shirts at the gambling table, most looking for &#8220;bus fare&#8221;), hookers, and if you looked carefully, the dealers.<br />
But by far the most noticeable and despicable mendicants were the magazine distributors. Remember the prostitute magazine that Stefan had been looking for the night before? You didn&#8217;t need to look on Las Vegas Boulevard &#8212; the distributors found you. And they didn&#8217;t care in the least who they gave them out to. Men, women, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they even gave them to children. You didn&#8217;t even have to chance a glance at one of them to have a magazine thrust against you.<br />
I really didn&#8217;t know which was sadder: the prostitutes advertising in the magazine, or the people giving them out. One would expect men, and some pretty sleazy ones at that. We were not disappointed in that regard. I was surprised, and somewhat shocked, to see several women dealing the adverts. It takes a lot to shock me, and that wasn&#8217;t something I was expecting. But it wasn&#8217;t the mere fact that women were doing this &#8212; it was the look on their faces as they did it. I couldn&#8217;t tell what the expression meant exactly, but the disgust of what they held, the despair of what they had to do, and sadness all seemed to exude through the leathery skin of their Latin-American faces. What they did was below begging, and they knew it.<br />
I personally have a thing against prostitution as well. I find it to be the most degrading thing a human can do &#8212; selling their bodies to survive, often in disregard of their well-being. Mind you, I frown upon pimps even more, they force others into harlotry so they can literally steal from those they &#8220;employ&#8221;. In Las Vegas, prostitution is legal &#8230; but no more moral or ethical than anywhere else. If the gambling alone doesn&#8217;t do it, the addition of prostitution certainly earns Vegas the name &#8220;Sin City&#8221;.<br />
We stopped for a while at Bally&#8217;s, pondering whether we wound venture inside and see what its casino was like. But we opted instead to stay outside and take a few pictures and look at the light sculptures Bally&#8217;s had installed. One such group was a series of tall semi-circular pillars that slowly changed colours. Against the background of gardens and fountains, they were beautiful to watch.<br />
We pressed onward along Las Vegas Boulevard heading south. Between Bally&#8217;s and the MGM Grand, there was only the Holiday Inn Boardwalk hotel on the opposite side of the street, which wasn&#8217;t much to look at. The MGM Grand on the other hand, was a very impressive sight. Currently the largest casino in Las Vegas (and possibly the world), the immense building glowed with a light green that was so appealing, we actually stopped to stare at it for a while.<br />
At the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue we found the majestic MGM Grand entrance, the huge stylized MGM lion guarding the gates. It never crossed our minds to go inside, we were more intent on seeing more of The Strip at the time. From the intersection&#8217;s corner we could see the Tropicana (south of the MGM Grand, across Tropicana Avenue), and the Excalibur (south-west of the MGM Grand, on the diagonal corner). The Tropicana was nothing special in its appearance, but the Excalibur&#8217;s bold white and blue construction, bathed in a strong white light was something to behold.<br />
Built along Arthurian styles, the Excalibur featured a castle structure (which undoubtedly contained the casino), and two long hotel wings built on either side of the castle. The castle sported several towers and spires, all topped with bright blue caps which seemed to glow even at night. (They didn&#8217;t glow nearly as bright as the top of the Luxor, just south of Excalibur.)<br />
The intersection of Tropicana and The Strip had no crosswalks, even though there didn&#8217;t seem to be any reason for the oversight. However, in lieu of paint on the asphalt, someone built two pedestrian overpasses: one running over The Strip on the north side of Tropicana, and another over Tropicana on the west side of The Strip. This effectively linked Excalibur with MGM Grand.<br />
We hopped up the escalator to the first overpass and made our way to the north-west corner. And into our view came the next big thing to hit Las Vegas: New York, New York. A venture between the MGM Grand and another company, New York, New York would create a condensed skyline of the city for which it was named. Still under construction while we were there, even the darkened half-skeleton of the resort was impressive. A construction office on the ground level had a model of the soon-to-be casino, offering a free night&#8217;s stay at the hotel when it opened. Judging from what I saw, the next time I&#8217;m in Las Vegas, I want to stay at New York New York.<br />
We crossed the next overpass to Excalibur, and went inside. By now, my legs were hurting. We had not walked that far, but for some strange reason I was utterly exhausted. Stefan and Rebecca weren&#8217;t much better off, so at least I didn&#8217;t feel like a weakling. Dhar, on the other hand, had every right to be feeling a little tired.<br />
After traveling down the long walkway inside (Dhar rode the moving sidewalk instead), we entered into a true Vegas casino: tacky in every sense of the word. Gold trim, gaudy fixtures, ugly carpets &#8230; the whole eyesore shebang. Simply from its appearance, I judged it to be a leftover from the heady days of the &#8217;70&#8217;s, when tacky was the norm. Much to my surprise, I learned that Excalibur was opened in 1991.<br />
The slots called again, but not before Dhar purchased what he, Stefan, and Rebecca called a horrid drink. Served in a large tacky bluish glass (part of the reason, I think, that Dhar bought it in the first place), it was supposed to have Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, orange juice, and a couple other things thrown in for taste. Apparently it didn&#8217;t work too well as a whole.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we found the ultimate slots: if you won, you got to drive home a brand-new Dodge Viper. At a quarter a pull, it was the most expensive slots they played. But with little success. By this point, I had reached the end of the second stage of Lasvegasitis, and suddenly found myself in stage three: I wanted to try my luck at the slots.<br />
But I knew that my luck was horrible, it always was, and I chickened out of the dollar slot machine. Instead I plunked three nickels into a one-armed bandit and promptly lost. My grand total gambling losses to date amount to $2.15 ($2 Canadian, $0.15 American) &#8230; though I suspect I lost the $2 more to theft than to gambling, but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<br />
Finding our general luck to be rather dismal, we headed towards the south hotel wing and the exit. We wanted to go that way so we could get to the Luxor with a minimum amount of effort. All of us were feeling rather worn out, it was looking like we wouldn&#8217;t see anything else that night. I really wanted to see Fremont Street and the lighted ceiling, but I began to accept that it would have to wait until another trip.<br />
The walk to Luxor was a short one. The closer we got to the hotel the smaller it looked. Whenever I saw the Luxor on TV or in a magazine, I equated the black pyramid-shaped building to the Egyptian pyramids on the Giza plateau. Although I&#8217;d not been to Egypt, it was plain to see that Luxor was a much smaller scale development.<br />
The inside of Luxor was &#8230; unspectacular, I was not impressed at all. Although the architect had placed all the rooms on the outside of the hotel, running diagonal elevators along the edges to service the 20 or so levels, it just didn&#8217;t look awesome enough. The interior was large enough to hold 14 Boeing 747 airplanes. But even that fact didn&#8217;t look impressive. It might have been my lack of energy, something which would make even the MGM Grand start to look dull.<br />
We unfortunately missed out on a tour that the Luxor ran, which I completely forgot about while we were there. It was a three-part multimedia virtual-reality spectacular that got rave reviews for the level of technology it used. But in a way the loss wasn&#8217;t so bad &#8212; more too look forward to the next time &#8217;round the block.<br />
After only a few minutes we decided to head back to our hotel room. But we made it only as far as the front door before hailing a cab. The taxi driver was an interesting fellow, he gave us his personal view of Las Vegas which essentially amounted to our trip&#8217;s motto: Been there, done that &#8230; next!<br />
A few minutes later we were back at the hotel, and hungry. But the ice cream parlour that I had so wanted to visit closed at midnight, we were over an hour late to gorge ourselves on frozen delights. We turned instead to one of the lower-rung restaurants, just off of Treasure Island&#8217;s casino. Keno boards could be seen on every wall, updating their information about every half-hour or so.<br />
There seemed to be a certain curtness about the wait-staff, almost like they wanted to have us complain and get them fired &#8230; almost. My desire for ice cream vanished, and I instead ordered a hot meal and a cold beer. I followed Stefan&#8217;s suggestion and ordered a Heineken. Until that point, I hadn&#8217;t found any light-coloured beers that I liked. Most had this a aftertaste that bothered me. But when all was said and done, the Heineken wasn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
One of the bartenders stared regularly at Dhar. We wondered why: possibly Dhar&#8217;s blue bandanna, which he wore almost constantly after the Grand Canyon. In any case, Dhar was about ready to start causing trouble when our bill arrived. We paid and left before Dhar got us ejected from the hotel.<br />
Dhar and I slept on cots that night, and it felt good to sleep on an honest-to-God mattress with sheets around my legs. I didn&#8217;t need to worry about Dhar&#8217;s snoring that night, I think I actually fell asleep before he did.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Viva Las Vegas! More specifically, Cirque du Soleil. What an amazing show. We walked part of The Strip tonight, but we never made it to Fremont before we were worn out. Dhar went off on his own and sounded like he almost scored&#8230; Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day&#8230;</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Morning began almost the same as Colorado Springs: cool and bright. But our distance south had provided us with a few degrees more warmth, making the morning not quite as shocking as the day before. Something else was different &#8212; no humidity on the walls. Once again Dhar was the first to rise, followed by myself, Stefan, and eventually, Rebecca.<br />
I got my first good look at the camp that morning. It looked smaller than the one in Colorado Springs, but then again Cortez wasn&#8217;t exactly the place to travel (or at least so I thought when I first got up that morning). Under the navigator&#8217;s windshield wiper was a small piece of paper, left by the camp management. It was a reminder to check in at the office that morning. It was the first and last such reminder we saw staying at the KOAs.<br />
There&#8217;s something about waking up at Cortez that I never really could quite comprehend. Cortez is mostly a flat plain, wedged between a few mountain ranges quite some distance apart. A few mesas interrupt the vastness, but not so much that it&#8217;s disturbing. Morning there is extremely peaceful. There&#8217;s no highway, no clamouring industry, no planes. It&#8217;s quiet. It&#8217;s slow. It&#8217;s too bad we couldn&#8217;t have spent the day there relaxing. But we had things to do, places to see.<br />
Showers were the first order of the day. The stalls were much better than the ones in Colorado Springs, as we now had two taps to control the water&#8217;s temperature. I hastened back to the van to get dressed and prepare for the drive out to the Grand Canyon, as that was the primary goal of the day. Secondary to that was a stop at Four Corners.<br />
Stefan arrived a moment later, allowing Rebecca to go and have her shower. Stefan quickly gathered up his wallet-pouch and headed over to the office to clear up any issues with our late check-in. I sauntered into the office a few minutes later and looked over some of the things they had in the store. I purchased more postcards and stamps while Stefan got the bill straightened out.<br />
No sooner had I stepped up to pay for my purchases than Stefan announced we had a change in plans for the day. My immediate reaction was one of annoyance, since he had not discussed this change with anyone so far. He quickly clarified himself by asking if I&#8217;d ever heard of Mesa Verde, to which I responded I had. He then informed me that it was about 10 miles away from our camp. I suddenly realized two things: 1) Why there was a KOA in Cortez, and 2) We were going to be late getting to the Grand Canyon.<br />
We informed Rebecca and Dhar of the slight change in plans when we got back to the Behemoth. Fortunately, neither objected to the change, even though none of us really knew what we were getting ourselves in to. The van was disconnected from the water and electricity, the oil and fluids checked, and a couple water bottles filled. I then took my position behind the wheel and headed us back towards Highway 160. We turned right and headed east.<br />
The trip was fairly short, we could see the mesas just to the south-east. We passed a sign indicating a radio frequency we could listen to park information on. The quality of the broadcast was horrible, but thankfully short, taking only about seven minutes to tell us all that we needed to know. It wasn&#8217;t long after the sign that the part entrance appeared.<br />
The park entrance off Highway 160 was 26 miles from the Visitor&#8217;s Center, which was where we had to go before we could find out what it was that we had to see. For some reason, this was either the most direct (or the safest) route into the park. I found it hard to believe that it was shorter for us to drive to the park entrance from the KOA than to get into the park itself. After paying our five dollar (American) entrance fee, we entered the second harrowing drive in as many days.<br />
The park, like the structures it was designed to showcase and protect, was situated on the top of a huge mesa, over 750 feet above Highway 160. The road to get to that height had to bend around the edges of the mesa and slowly take us to the top. The views we saw were as beautiful as the ones we had seen the day before traveling through the mountain ranges. Only here we were treated to a completely different palette of colours: browns, reds, oranges, and greens. Off in the distance the Rockies were still visible, their white peaks reminding us of days past.<br />
The route was lined with steep cliffs on one side and steep hills on the other. Although the speed limit was significantly higher than at Cave of the Winds, I chose to drive cautiously and not look over the edge unless we were stopped. This didn&#8217;t stop the others from peering out, oohing and ahhing, and telling me not too look. What I did keep an eye out for were the foxes, deer, and wild turkeys that were supposed to live in the area. (Although I didn&#8217;t want to hit a fox or a deer, a wild turkey would have made a great change in our dinner menu.)<br />
About 45 minutes after entering the park, the Visitor&#8217;s Center came into view as we rounded a corner. It was an interesting structure: a two-storey circular building with a spiraling ramp around the outside. The building was on the left side of the road we were on, and the Visitor&#8217;s Center parking lot was on the right. The two were connected by a walkway underpass.<br />
Upon entering the parking lot we saw our first vehicle from Canada, a beat-up orange Ford camper from Alberta. I wanted to find the drivers and swap stories, but we had no such luck. We wandered under the road and up the ramp on the other side. The building had a balcony that overlooked an area exceeding 5,000 square miles on a hazy day. (On a clear day, it was said you could see all the way to Phoenix, Arizona &#8212; about 300 miles away.)<br />
But a clear day hadn&#8217;t been seen at the Visitor&#8217;s Center since the late 50&#8217;s. The sign told of a major problem that had befallen the area: air pollution. Although the nearest industrial centre was some 100 miles away, the problem had not gone unnoticed. Just southwest of the park I could see a long brown cloud. At first I had thought it might be a dust storm, the deserts and the wind in that region of the United States are known for dust storms. But after reading the sign, I knew that such a cloud could only be one thing: smog.<br />
I have lived in a city all my life, I have seen pollution in many forms. In a way, I have come accustomed and maybe even immune to seeing it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t like pollution &#8212; I&#8217;m all for different ways of getting rid of it safely. It&#8217;s just that if you stare at something long enough, you tend not to notice it as much. Toronto has a brownish haze to it for most of the summer months, and once in a while during the winter. Inside the city you&#8217;ll never notice a thing.<br />
Outside the city my perspectives change, and where there are lots of trees, I expect clean fresh air. Colorado Springs had such air. But Mesa Verde is surrounded by nothingness for hundreds of miles. And yet the air pollution was worse than in an industrial centre. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should weep for the environment, for our children, or for the Native Americans who had to live in that pollution. In a way the only winners are those who profit at the expense of everything and everyone else.<br />
Inside the doors was a combination park information desk, bookstore, and museum. Two park rangers presided over the desk, providing information on the park and the tours, and taking fees for the guided tours. The park had three main sites open at the time we were there including two cliff dwellings and a small restored village.<br />
Mesa Verde sound familiar yet? If the name doesn&#8217;t ring a bell, a picture of it would. Over two thousand years ago, a group of Indians called the Anasazi settled on Mesa Verde and began their culture here. Related to the Pueblo Indians, they brought the craft of building adobe huts for shelter with them. But out in the open, they found life very harsh. In an attempt to build villages that would withstand the often brutal environment, they built cities into the cliffs.<br />
If you&#8217;ve ever seen a picture of a city built into the side of a small mountain, then you&#8217;ve most likely seen Cliff Palace, which is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. Because of its size and history, it&#8217;s also the only cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde that you can&#8217;t visit without a Park Ranger. Thus there is a cost for the tour, not only in cash, but in time &#8212; in excess of two hours. Cost for us wasn&#8217;t an issue (usually), but time was. We opted to do a self-guided tour of smaller dwellings.<br />
After figuring out our plan of attack, we did a tour of the museum. Although small for a museum of Native Indians, the exhibits contained pottery, jewelry, clothes, and pictures of at least eight different tribes of Indians. Many of these things I had seen before in documentaries, National Geographic and other museums, so in truth, I wasn&#8217;t all that interested in them. I started to goad the others into hastier actions, since I wanted to get to the Grand Canyon before it got dark.<br />
We got back in the van and drove further down the road we had traveled on. About seven or so miles down the road we arrived a parking lot surrounded by a gift shop and toilets on one side, and another museum on the other. All around us beyond the buildings were small trees, no greater than three metres tall. Unlike the deciduous trees further north, these had their leaves.<br />
Mesa Verde must have received its name from these shrub-like trees. In English, Mesa Verde translates roughly to &#8220;green plateau&#8221;. Unlike the plains next to Highway 160, the ground on the mesa was completely covered in trees &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t see more than five metres into the forest.<br />
We hopped out and began to figure out how to get down to the dwellings. We walked to the end of the parking lot (about twenty metres) and crossed over to the other side of the road next to another museum. There we quickly found more paths that seemed to lead into a small valley just beyond the museum. The trees continually blocked our view until we found a jutting of sedimentary rock upon which no tree grew. Climbing out on top of it, we caught our first glimpse of the dwellings on the opposite side of the valley.<br />
As a kid, someone could have easily labeled me as a nerd (not to mention that someone still could) &#8212; I always read. The books I read were rarely fiction. I preferred the sort of books that explained the world around me. Not being religious, I received my explanations from scientific bases. National Geographic took me around the world, Time-Life taught me how the world was formed and why continents drift, and PBS showed me sights I never thought I&#8217;d see.<br />
When I went to the Soviet Union in 1989, I saw things I had only heard of before and saw on the odd documentary or in a rare issue of National Geographic. I knew then that experience was no replacement for a facsimile. A picture may tell a thousand words, but an experience shows you the world. As with my first look at the Rocky Mountains, my initial glimpse of the dwellings was both exciting and awe-inspiring. And I was hungry for more.<br />
The route to the dwellings took us down the one side of the valley (a drop of less than 150 feet), across the floor and slightly up the other side. Along the way were markers that indicated points of interest, listed on a small map Rebecca had picked up prior to us descending into the valley. The map showed different types of flora that grew in the valley, and places where the Anasazi had scraped out a living.<br />
One of these places was at the apex of the valley, where a small spring was located. The spring formed when rain water and melting snow leaked through the rock and pooled. It was dry when we arrived, and I wondered if it had been wet any time in the past decade.<br />
But it was the dwellings we had come to see. There was something almost magical about stepping near them, like the spirits of the past were watching us. They watched from the darkened windows, through deep doorways, and from the trees that grew behind us. Whether they were smiling upon us for remembering their history or passing a curse that would last for generations, we didn&#8217;t know.<br />
The cave the dwellings were built into was roughly 150 metres long, 20 metres deep and about 30 metres high. The roof of the cave sloped down from the full height of 30 metres down to less than 10 at the rear. Rather, the rear that we could see. The dwellings were roped off in several strategic places to keep visitors from crawling all over the site. In the past this had been allowed, but assumedly over time things got damaged.<br />
The dwellings were an impressive sight, if only from their history &#8212; the buildings were nearly 2,000 years old. According to the Park Ranger, the Anasazi abandoned the dwellings long before the Roman Empire crumbled. Yet here were structures as high as three stories, made of stone, mud, and cedar logs. The assemblage looked flimsy by appearance, but must have been very strong to have withstood the elements for so long with so little damage. The walls of the buildings ran from the cave floor to the cave ceiling, which must have provided a great deal of structural integrity. The cedar logs inside the towers must also have contributed to the longevity.<br />
Just outside the cave were large holes, about 6 metres across and a just under three metres deep. At first I had no idea what they were, until I noticed a ladder seemingly coming out of the ground. The holes were ceremonial chambers (the name of which completely escapes me) that were dug into the ground then covered over with logs and flagstones. Small holes just outside the hole&#8217;s walls allowed air to enter the chamber and fan fires that burned inside.<br />
For some reason, Stefan took objection to the Park Ranger&#8217;s explanation of the hole&#8217;s use as a ceremonial chamber. (I had not been aware that Queen&#8217;s Engineers were required to take anthropology courses. ) Stefan believed they were sweat houses, similar to the ones used by other tribes.<br />
After touring the site for about half an hour, I started to goad the others into moving again. I wanted to make sure we&#8217;d get to our destinations while we still had light. A group of Native American schoolchildren who appeared to have come to the Park to learn about their heritage passed us as we slowly began to work our way back up the side of the valley.<br />
The climb back up was much more difficult than it looked. I wasn&#8217;t sure my exhaustion was due to the altitude (hence, lack of oxygen) or my general physical shape (which I wasn&#8217;t in). Either way, I was fairly winded by the time we got back to the top. A woman in front of me didn&#8217;t even make it that far before she had to sit down to catch her breath.<br />
Despite my goading, Rebecca ducked into the museum. We naturally followed to see what was there. The museum showcased some aspects of life the Visitor&#8217;s Center didn&#8217;t touch upon. Methods of weaving, how the cliff dwellings came into being, and general ways of life. A slide show in an adjacent room provided a more in depth view of Anasazi life, but we never got a chance to see it. Instead we browsed the museum&#8217;s gift shop.<br />
Somewhere along the time we got briefly separated and we lost track of Rebecca. While Stefan and Dhar wandered up to the main gift shop, I waited in the van to make sure Rebecca wouldn&#8217;t walk by unnoticed. As it turned out, we men were blind and had missed Rebecca while she was in the museum. Soon we were all buckled in and heading back out towards Highway 160.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960424.1275</strong><br />
<em>Day 4</em><br />
Mesa Verde &#8211; a mystery? Many will speculate, but the truth will never be known &#8211; long drive to get there though. Next step is the 4 Corners, then (with any luck) the Grand Canyon.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We all agreed that the excursion had been worth it. None of us had seen anything like it before and I shuddered to think that I might not see anything like it again. To think that a people that every text lists as &#8220;primitive&#8221; could build such an impressive and enduring city is to not acknowledge the genius that was at work, and also to not acknowledge how far we haven&#8217;t come in those 1,000 years since the village was abandoned.<br />
On the trip back, we were heading mostly downhill. The van handled moderately better than on the way up, but I was still a bit edgy. Somewhere on this trip down the van was named by a member of our group (though who it was I honestly don&#8217;t remember) &#8212; &#8220;The Behemoth&#8221;. The name seemed very appropriate: it handled like a dead mule, accelerated like a turtle on tranquilizers, and braked like a marble on a greased roadway down a hill. We could see over almost anything on the road except semi-trailers and cube vans. We could comfortably sleep four adults. This was no ordinary vehicle.<br />
Upon reaching Highway 160, I turned left and headed back towards Cortez, where we would briefly link up with Highway 666 before heading southwest towards the Four Corners. The sound of The Beach Boys echoed through the van as we whipped through the downtown core of Cortez, a distance of about four miles. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were cruising down Highway 666 towards Shiprock, New Mexico.<br />
Surprisingly enough, it took a while for someone else to notice what highway we were traveling on. It came as quite a surprise to the others that there was in fact a highway named &#8220;666&#8221;, especially when one considers that according to Christian doctrines, that&#8217;s the number of the Beast. But if there is a highway to hell, the Highway 666 is it. The south end of Colorado and well into New Mexico is barren &#8212; no trees, hardly any shrubs, no water, a few lonely mesas and hundreds of dry river beds.<br />
Shiprock wasn&#8217;t our destination however, and we left Highway 666 about seven miles from the Colorado / New Mexico border to continue along Highway 160. But not before we pulled over to take a picture documenting to the Doubting Thomases back home that the Americans did in fact worship the Devil in some parts of the country.<br />
By this time, we were well into Indian country. We entered the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation about 10 miles outside Cortez. When we entered Arizona we crossed into the Navajo Indian Reservation for some 200 miles of desolation, ending at the Kaibab National Forest.<br />
It was the desolation that I found most intriguing. The American government had taken all the Native Indians and had placed them in this area of the United States. According to Rebecca, there had been a study published by the Government about the area several decades ago which claimed that the area was unsuitable for farming, fishing, raising cattle, industry, commerce, and living in general. On the top of the report there was the ink of a rubber stamp: Suitable for Indians. The truly depressing part is that it wasn&#8217;t an American government &#8212; it was Canadian. I didn&#8217;t want to know what the American governments had done.<br />
We didn&#8217;t come into contact with any Native Indians until we reached the Four Corners. The Four Corners is the only geographic / political location in the United States where four states touch at a common point. I always imagined that the four corners were marked by white chalk stones on the top of a grassy hill, kind of like the one featured in Coca-Cola commercials I had seen. But we were in an area that had no trees, let alone grass, and the only hills were steep-faced mesas.<br />
Highway 160 briefly enters New Mexico before going into Arizona, it was from the New Mexico corner that we entered the site. Existing in designated Ute Indian territory, the Ute Indians managed the Four Corners allowing members of other tribes to enter and sell their wares to tourists. At first everyone was dismayed at the five dollar entry fee to look at some lines in the dirt. I was quick to point out however that Native Indians have always had a hard shake from the Government (United States or Canadian), never receiving true compensation for all that they have lost. As far as I was concerned, five dollars was a very reasonable price.<br />
Four Corners is, to put it politely, a very basic tourist trap. The actual location of the four state corners (which, in all honesty, ain&#8217;t much to look at) is ringed by about 30 wooden stalls where Native Indians sell &#8220;authentic&#8221; Indian crafts and food. Quite often, so I&#8217;ve found in the past, many of the crafts are made in Taiwan, and the food comes from local 7-11s (though if there was a local 7-11 at Four Corners, someone went to great lengths to camouflage it). I didn&#8217;t go up to the stalls to verify my suspicions, so you may assume that I am incorrect in my beliefs.<br />
The Four Corners is essentially a large light grey concrete square about six metres across, with two lines running diagonally forming an &#8216;X&#8217; in the middle. At the apex of the &#8216;X&#8217; is a large dark grey circle, about a metre in diametre. In each of the four triangles formed by the &#8216;X&#8217; is the appropriate state&#8217;s name and seal. Tubular railing mounted all over the concrete platform ruined the site for me, there was no way to take a picture without getting at least ten metres of the stuff in the frame.<br />
Rebecca took the opportunity to review the stalls, while Dhar and I remained in the centre of the roadway. Both of us felt guilty about walking by the stalls and not buying anything. I felt guilty in general about the treatment of Indians, both in the U.S. and in Canada. Alas, my personal beliefs are not shared by many. While I believe the Indians should be allowed to settle wherever they want, many people I&#8217;ve overheard in conversations go with more Darwinist tactics &#8212; we beat them, they deserve nothing. It&#8217;s that kind of attitude that causes strife in our world, and will eventually lead to the destruction of our civilization if left uncontrolled.<br />
It was almost 14:00 when we boarded the van once more, this time with Rebecca at the helm, for our long drive across the State of Arizona. It was over 200 miles to the Grand Canyon, and would take us just over three hours to get there. The worst part of the ordeal was that the temperature kept rising as we drove, and the air conditioner had been left off to conserve gasoline.<br />
The terrain, despite its given name of &#8220;Colorado Plateau&#8221;, was full of hills and valleys. The cruise control on the van continually shifted in and out of the overdrive to deal with the rises and falls. Several times we had to turn the cruise control off as we drove just keep the engine from sounding like it was going to burst from its housing. I shudder think what the engine would have sounded like with the air conditioning on.<br />
And I sometimes wished that the air conditioning was on. Less than a day before we were in the high teens for temperature, quite comfortable for those who had been in a long winter. But in Arizona those temperatures were easily doubled inside the van. Every window and vent that we could safely open blew and sucked warm air throughout the van. Rebecca took advantage of wearing her skirt by having the driver&#8217;s foot vent blow air right up her dress.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Arizona has one thing over Kansas &#8211; at least we can tell we&#8217;re actually getting somewhere. Kansas has one thing over Arizona &#8211; it&#8217;s much cooler. 80 degrees inside an enclosed space for four hours is going to hurt immensely. Rebecca got stuck with driving.We&#8217;re almost in the heart of the Navajo Indian Reservation. Have to feel sorry for them &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing here, not like there used to be when they lived in the Great Plains.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I do mean nothing. The majority of things we saw out there was sand and sun. The only place more desolate than that would be either the Sahara Desert, or Antarctica &#8212; they receive about the same amount of precipitation and have about equal ability to sustain life. That part of Arizona wasn&#8217;t too far behind.<br />
Only the movements of the mesa and rock formations told us that we were going anywhere. Kansas was too flat for any such markers. Once in a while we would spot a few Indians with their livestock, usually sheep or goats, grazing along the road on the wrong side of the fence.<br />
We passed one rather interesting anomaly along our route. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but it was certainly strange. We passed under what looked like a covered conveyor belt, running from a mesa about a kilometre or so from the highway. It continued across the highway to a large structure I could only define as a holding tank. Alongside the building was a single-track railroad, with electrical lines running along the route.<br />
Electric trains in North American are a rarity. Electric trains in the middle of Nowhere, Arizona are unheard of. Yet here was such a train. The tracks ran alongside the highway for about 50 miles or so before vanishing off into the distance. Not once did a train pass along the line, nor was there any signs indicating what it might be. Alas, it remains a mystery.<br />
Not quite as much a mystery was another of Stefan&#8217;s annoying habits, though probably only annoying to me. Stefan&#8217;s father, aside from being a brilliant engineer, was also an accomplished musician. I&#8217;ve found that children of musicians seem to have a keen ear for how things should sound. Almost every time we put on a new CD to listen to, Stefan would jump to the equalizer on the van&#8217;s stereo and fiddle with the controls. Several times I was tempted to slap his hands and tell him to keep the hell away from it. But I couldn&#8217;t entirely blame him &#8212; I&#8217;ve been known to do the same thing.<br />
This particular habit of Stefan&#8217;s was particularly common when he was navigator. One of the navigator&#8217;s duties, aside from figuring out where we were and which way we were supposed to travel, was put in new CDs every so often. And when Stefan was in charge of this, the equalizer controls were shifted. While this custom was annoying to me, I will grant that Stefan had a knack for making a mediocre CD playing on a portable CD player through a cassette deck adapter sound pretty damn good.<br />
Music was one of the few things that kept us sane as we crossed over large expanses of land. The north-east corner of Arizona was just such a case. We made few stops while passing through Navajo country, one of them was in at the Tuba City Booger Thing. Sorry, Burger King. (I&#8217;ve never been too fond of that particular fast-food franchise, the food never really sat well with me. The only Burger King in Oakville died in 1990 or 1991, and was replaced with a Tim Horton&#8217;s. A much better choice, if you ask me.)<br />
Everyone except me got something to eat. I wasn&#8217;t particularly hungry anyway, so I really didn&#8217;t care too much. Heat seldom makes me that hungry. Rebecca relinquished her driver&#8217;s position to Stefan. I took his place as navigator as we headed to the end of Highway 160 to pick up Highway 89. As Stefan drove, he continued to be amazed at how long we had been inside the Navajo Indian Reservation. I continued to be amazed at how dirty it was.<br />
So far, all of our tours on the highways of American, Interstate or otherwise, had been very pleasant. Everything had been clean. Now whether it was the fact that Highway 160 went through the middle of Navajo country and thus was excluded from Federal or State Transportation Departments I don&#8217;t know. But what I do know is that there was more garbage along the sides of those highways than my family generates in a year. It was disheartening to see such neglect, but I didn&#8217;t know who to blame: the governments, the Indians, or the motorists. Well, obviously the motorists&#8230;<br />
After leaving Highway 160 for Highway 89, we briefly headed south for 15 miles. We then resumed our westerly heading along Route 64, which took us into Kaibab National Forest, and eventually into the Grand Canyon National Park.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it was the lack of food, the dehydration, sleeplessness, or the heat, but I was getting irritable. Really irritable. The moment we saw a canyon, Stefan&#8217;s eyes started to frequently leave the road and look into parts of the Grand Canyon. To be blunt, this pissed me off. We came close to the edge of a canyon wall once or twice, but the fact that he didn&#8217;t watch the road while we were driving was getting on my nerves. Several times I came close to telling him to pull the van over so I could drive. But before I worked up enough gumption to become a complete asshole, we entered more trees and Stefan was forced to return to the major job of driving.<br />
After paying a $7 entrance fee (valid for seven days), we proceeded to the first stop within the Park, known as the Watchtower. We could see the tower when we pulled in, but we didn&#8217;t proceed to it just yet, as we had other things to do first. Among them was a trip to the toilet, a tour through the first of two gift shops, and a call home.<br />
The Grand Canyon hardly had any visible signs of native animals, the only animals we saw were ravens. These were huge birds, about the size of a small turkey. They hopped around the picnic areas like the seagulls and terns we&#8217;re accustomed to back home. Dhar and I were a little surprised at the enormity of the birds, seemingly almost mutant.<br />
One of the gift shops was near to where we parked, and was one of our stops. I just knew that a gift shop in America&#8217;s best known natural wonder was going to have some of the gaudiest souvenirs ever concocted by man. I was not disappointed. I won&#8217;t tell you all that I saw, but there were t-shirts, hats, posters, cacti, and bandannas. Any place selling bandannas should be avoided. That&#8217;s not to say that places selling wall clocks made from slices of tree trunks, or cow dung for that matter, are any better.<br />
Outside the store was a phone, which Stefan and Rebecca made use of to contact their kids back home. Eric was loving the vacation from his end of the phone, because it meant that he didn&#8217;t have to go to school. Staying with the grandparents meant that he was too far from school to be taken in every day. I felt sorry for Stefan&#8217;s parents (who were minding the kids), I knew from first-hand experience just how hard it was to keep Eric calm for a mere five minutes, let alone 12 days.<br />
It was just after 18:00 in the afternoon when I finally got my first look at the Grand Canyon. We walked down a path away from both the parking lot and the gift shop, heading approximately north. Even though we were still a hundred metres from the edge of the gorge, we could already see the splendour that attracted tourists from around the world. It was yet another visual feast for the senses.<br />
Having formed from hundreds of millions of years of sedimentary rock, then millions more years of erosion from wind and water, the Grand Canyon is named as well as the English language can suffice. There is no equal to the intricacies and the blatant beauty of the canyon, nor is there a succinct enough word or phrase that can accurately describe it. Although I don&#8217;t know what the phrasing would be, the Native Indians probably have a word or a name in their languages that describes the Grand Canyon much better.<br />
The ochre and pale orange rock glowed in the setting sun, the entire valley looked like a giant ember from a dying fire. You could follow hundreds of layers of rock to the bottom of the canyon, where the deep turbulent blue of the Colorado River cooled the intensity of the view. By the time we reached the Watchtower&#8217;s position, we could see for what seemed a hundred miles north and east. Trees blocked our view to the south, and heavy haze shielded our glance to the west. Yet even that haze cast a heavenly glow about the deep &#8216;V&#8217; in the Earth, as if carved by the hands of gods.<br />
We basked in the warmth of the view and struggled in the stiff wind that blew through the canyon, taking several pictures of a sight I&#8217;ll probably not see for some time, if ever again. But soon curiousity won over my Grand experience, and I decided that a review of the Watchtower was in order. This started with a quick look at a plaque placed just in front of it.<br />
Built in the early 1930&#8217;s, the Watchtower had been designed by early tour operators to provide an excellent view of the Grand Canyon. The Watchtower was built from rocks local to the area, and from nearby trees. The Watchtower was built in two parts: the base section and the tower itself. The construction of the base was similar in nature to the ceremonial pits we had seen at Mesa Verde earlier in the day &#8212; circular in formation, with long wood logs creating short arcs around the walls forming a partial dome upon which the roof was constructed.<br />
The room was almost perfectly circular, except for the side the tower was attached to. There the circle had a squarish protrusion. The base functioned almost entirely as a gift shop. The majority of the items in the store were much more appropriate for such a venue, not at all like the things at the gift shop at the parking lot. The squarish protrusion contained mostly t-shirts.<br />
The tower was accessed by a set of curving stairs from the base, guarded by a turnstile that cost a quarter to use. Unlike the phones in Colorado Springs, the turnstile took a Canadian quarter, which unfortunately was the only quarter I had at the time. (I swear it!)<br />
These stairs took you to the first level of the tower which contained a circular display case in the middle, and a Native Indian fresco on the wall opposite to the stairway leading to the base. Near the stairway was a door that led to an observation level on the base&#8217;s roof. The fresco was mostly red and brown with some white. Dhar and I took pictures of the fresco, but due to misreading my light levels, my picture of the fresco was far too dark.<br />
Another staircase led you up to the second level of the tower, which contained only a couple benches and some small windows. This level was essentially a ring around the inside of the tower, the centre looked down into the first level of the tower. Another set of stairs led to the third and last level of the tower.<br />
The windows on the third level were much more open to viewing than the ones on lower levels. Coin-operated telescopes allowed a more close-up view of parts of the canyon. Signs on the wall gave instructions to camera users on how to obtain zoom shots with the use of the canyons. Dhar fed a quarter into one of the telescopes and immediately decided that using the telescope as a zoom lens was not a good idea. I concluded the same after a quick peek.<br />
To this point in the trip, I had not succumbed to any tourist purchases except for the postcards. But one of the shirts on sale in the squarish protrusion in the base appealed to me. It was a dark olive colour with faint Navajo patterns. On the left breast was a small gold phoenix with the words &#8220;Grand Canyon&#8221; under the logo. I also took the opportunity to buy more film. I had meant to buy some earlier in the day, when we were at Mesa Verde, but the prices there had been completely outrageous. On future trips, I&#8217;m buying all my film in advance&#8230;<br />
I coaxed the others to proceed further down the road to another point about ten miles away so I could get a different view of the Canyon. Unfortunately, time wasn&#8217;t on our side and in a few minutes we would be without enough sunlight for my panoramic camera to work properly. Disposable cameras are fun and easy to use &#8230; but only when there&#8217;s bright sunlight around.<br />
Like the rest of Route 64, the road was usually bordered by trees on either side within the park, a calming kind of scenery. Yet the experience of driving down the side of a huge gash in the ground bordered by lush trees in the middle of a desert, listening to the Bee Gee&#8217;s &#8220;Stayin&#8217; Alive&#8221; was enough to strike a feeling of insanity in the sanest of people. Of course, I&#8217;m not about to vouch for the sanity of Dhar, Rebecca, or Stefan &#8212; I already know I was a lost cause.<br />
By the time we reached the next point, sunlight was questionable. Nevertheless I took the opportunity to try and take a couple pictures. I wandered around the guardrails (as many people frequently did) and went down about 80 feet into the canyon. From there I had an unobstructed view of the gorge&#8217;s walls. It was to be the last picture I would take, as the light levels quickly shrank away after that. Several people from Spain or Portugal (I couldn&#8217;t quite tell which) continued to take pictures of their group as I proceeded back up to the main tourist landing.<br />
There I found another sign, containing the history of a hotel that had once been in service in the park. On the opposite side was the history of a copper mine that had flourished for a brief period on the canyon floor. Both were built prior to the Depression, which quickly put an end to both ventures despite the popularity and profitability.<br />
The sun was disappearing fast, but our hunger was not. I hadn&#8217;t eaten since that morning (and even then I think all I ate was an orange), and Stefan&#8217;s lunch hadn&#8217;t kept him full for long. On a suggestion (from someone) we decided to stop at the Park&#8217;s picnic area and make our dinner. We had been keeping our chicken breasts thawed for just such an occasion. That night we would feast upon fajitas, vacation-style.<br />
We drove further west along the road until we reached the park headquarters where the campgrounds were located. Here Highway 180 started and joined with Route 64 (less formally known as the park road), beginning its trip south towards I-40, our eventual destination.<br />
We pulled into a spot and set about digging out the barbeque and propane tank. The signs indicated that we were only allowed to cook at the fireplaces provided. But the fireplaces required charcoal, which we didn&#8217;t have. I assumed the signs were to prevent campfires, but decided to avoid a nasty situation and placed the barbeque on top of the fireplace grill. It was a bit of an awkward fit, but it worked.<br />
About that point another van arrived in the parking lot. It was our mysterious friend from Alberta. I stood beside myself for a moment, wondering at the odds that we would see the same van twice in the same day, almost 300 miles from place to place. The temptation to wander over and meet our fellow countrymen was overwhelming. Hunger, however, won.<br />
By the time the green peppers halves and the chicken hit the grille, the sun had effectively set and darkness set in. The fact that we were eating in a forest didn&#8217;t help matters any &#8212; what little light that was left didn&#8217;t diffuse through the trees easily. Camp candles refused to stay lit for long in the night breeze no matter how much we tried to shield and re-light them.<br />
This caused a minor problem at the picnic table &#8212; we couldn&#8217;t see what we were eating. Before we had left home, my father had suggested that we take a flashlight. My mother had suggested that we take a huge camping light that used one of those heavy 12 volt batteries. I suggested the Snakelight instead. Black &amp; Decker can make a pretty good product, and the Snakelight is one of them. It&#8217;s not very powerful, you don&#8217;t have a bright narrow beam, but when wrapped around the trunk of a thin tree, it provides a dandy glow for having dinner. Black &amp; Decker should talk with MAG and create a hybrid Snakelight / MAG Light. Now there&#8217;s a product!<br />
The fajitas were just what I needed &#8212; I felt a whole lot better once I had finished. By the time I had eaten my last bite, the chicken was chilled and the peppers were polar &#8230; but tasty nonetheless. We then set about the quick task of cleaning up. Unlike several of our evening meals, we actually washed the dishes before leaving. (As the trip drew on, we got into the habit of leaving them out for longer periods of time. Hey &#8212; we were on vacation. Who wants to do housework on vacation?)<br />
Following a stop at the washrooms, we headed out to Highway 180 and began our hour long trip to the I-40. Dhar took control of the wheel, I resumed my position as navigator, Rebecca and Stefan took their place in bed.<br />
On exiting the Grand Canyon National Park, the theme for the trip was finally established through a collective effort: &#8220;Been there, done that &#8230; next!&#8221; This theme was appropriate for many reasons, though the primary one for us was in how the trip was being executed. We were going to some of the most spectacular sights in the Mid and Southwest, stopping briefly, taking in the view, and then heading to the next sight. After a while I started to feel like Chevy Chase in National Lampoon&#8217;s Vacation when he and the family stop briefly at the Grand Canyon on the way to Wally World.<br />
The trip down Highway 180 / Route 64 was uneventful. The view was darker than a black hole, broken only periodically by the piercing headlights of oncoming traffic. Once we exited Kaibab National Forest (which surrounded Grand Canyon National Park on the north and south sides of the Canyon), signs of civilization began to appear, including an IMAX theatre. When Highway 180 veered off to the southeast shortly after exiting the forest, we continued south on Route 64.<br />
Our gas supply was beginning to run low. The van had a tendency to go through the tank at an increasing rate from the time it was filled &#8212; the needle would drop very slowly at first, dropping quicker as the tank emptied. Typically when the tank reached a quarter full, we would start to look for a place to fill up.<br />
We reached Williams, Arizona about a half hour after leaving Highway 180. Gas prices had mysteriously risen to $1.35 a gallon. Until then, we had been paying $1.20 or less for gasoline, and were not exactly in the mood to be paying so much extra. Dhar and I made the decision to continue west along the I-40 to Ash Fork, where we hoped cheaper fuel could be found.<br />
But the gods weren&#8217;t with us that day. In fact, we had finally hit the first signs of bad timing of the entire trip. Unbeknownst to us, gas prices had started to climb dramatically in the United States. In Canada, fluctuations of as much as 10 cents were commonplace, and although a nuisance, were grudgingly accepted. A rise of a mere five cents in America is enough to get politicians voted out of office. Our poor timing was to land in the middle of these price hikes. The further west we traveled, the more expensive the gas became.<br />
We filled up at $1.37, and chose not to argue any further about the price. But even that would get us only as far as Kingman, Arizona before another fill-up would be needed. It was already 20:00, and we had five hours of driving to reach Las Vegas. A late entry to the KOA was going to be unavoidable.<br />
The speed limit across most of the I-40 was 75 miles per hour, a speed that none of us were too comfortable with the Behemoth. Unfortunately, the semi-trucks passing us at 85 miles per hour didn&#8217;t seem to mind so much. Such passings regularly spooked Dhar and I, keeping us awake for quite some time.<br />
Arizona is a sparsely populated state, as is Utah, New Mexico, and Nevada, Arizona&#8217;s neighbouring states. This sparse population leads to one beautiful thing about the night in that area of America &#8212; light pollution is not a concern. Several observatories are built in that area to take advantage of the lack of light. The lack of light also allows one to see lights from a great distance. Even at almost 200 miles distance, we could soon see the bright lights of Las Vegas as a faint glow in the sky. At first I thought it to be a nearby city, but we never passed the glow as we continued westward.<br />
Dhar tired quickly, driving for only an hour and a half before I took over. Rebecca took sole possession of the rear bunk as Stefan came up to join me, forcing Dhar to camp out in the lowered section of the floor (which was coincidentally just long enough for someone to lie down). There were a couple disadvantages to staying there while the Behemoth was in motion &#8212; the friction of the drive shaft caused the floor to become very warm, and the floor wasn&#8217;t sound proofed. Nor was it terribly comfortable.<br />
It was roughly 00:30 when we reached Kingman, the last major city in Arizona before hitting Nevada or California. Just outside of the city we filled up with increasingly expensive gas before making our punch into Nevada. Already the glow of Las Vegas was plain as the moon in a cloudless sky. There was a dusting of clouds that night though, which was the only way we could really see most of the lights. I have to wonder if any resident of Las Vegas has ever seen a starry sky.<br />
We left I-40 for Highway 93, which ran from Kingman directly to the Hoover Dam and Las Vegas. Highway 93 was barren &#8212; no trees and hardly anything to see within 100 metres of the road. But the further we drove up it, the more defined the lights in the sky became. In particular, the lights of the Luxor Grand Hotel and Casino. It was one of the new breed of resort hotels, designed to look like a gigantic pyramid. At the peak was a transparent cap, through which shone a 40 billion candlepower light. (Yes, you read correctly, 40 billion. With a &#8216;b&#8217;.)This light was so bright it could be seen from space on its own. In theory, you could cook a hot dog over it. And a bright spot in the massive glowing mass in the sky indicated where the Luxor lay.<br />
Stefan wanted to see those lights badly. I guess the desire was the result of being such an engineer. I was curious too, mind you &#8212; I had taken apart and assembled enough things in my day to be curious enough to wonder how most things worked. The lights themselves weren&#8217;t a mystery &#8212; how they got so bright was a different story.<br />
But first we had to cross the Hoover Dam. When it was built in the 1930&#8217;s, the dam provided the Arizona and Nevada Governments with something more than electricity &#8212; it provided a bridge across the gorges formed by the Colorado River. Highway 93 became the only road linking the two states, and was the only crossing for over 100 miles in any direction. Highway 93 carried a fair bit of traffic, even at 02:00.<br />
As we rode into the top of the valley, the lights that beamed from the dam announced its presence. At first I didn&#8217;t even recognize it &#8212; all the pictures and films I had seen before were taken during the day. In the valley, the only lights came from the dam itself. There were no spotlights, just a few bright lamps. The walls of the canyon were black, the reservoir was black, both were utterly featureless. As the road bent towards the eastern end of the dam, a small paved area formed to allow cars to stop. Stefan and I pulled out to take a look.<br />
I was mostly interested in a picture. I had wound in the film I had bought at the Grand Canyon, but had neglected to wind it properly. I didn&#8217;t notice this error until after the pictures were developed &#8212; about a quarter of the frame had light exposure damage. But the rest of the time lapse shot gave me a memory of the Hoover Dam at night. Stefan noted that there was a security car parked nearby, the guards watching our every move. For a brief moment I felt like a terrorist planning the ultimate Coup de Gras.<br />
Dhar awoke briefly as we started crossing the dam. He had no idea where we were until we told him that only 20 metres of concrete were preventing a lake from emptying itself and carrying us to certain death. Dhar urged me to drive a bit faster.<br />
Visibility around the site was minimal for that time of night. All we could see were a couple structures: the four intake towers in the reservoir, a parking garage on the Nevada side and a tourist centre across the road from the parking garage. We happily noticed one bonus of crossing the border &#8212; we had another hour to get to Las Vegas, we had entered the Pacific Time Zone, the fourth zone in as many days. It was just after 01:00 Nevada time, and we still had 30 miles to Las Vegas.<br />
The trip up the side of the canyon was slow, I was about as careful as when I had driven up to the Cave of the Winds. The primary difference here was that I couldn&#8217;t see must past the edge of the road. The greatest fear comes from not knowing &#8230; I didn&#8217;t know what (if anything) was down there, and I wasn&#8217;t too much in the mood to find out either.<br />
Soon we were back in a 65 mile an hour zone traveling along Highway 93 towards downtown Las Vegas. The glow in the sky was so large by this point that we couldn&#8217;t tell where it ended. The spotlights from the Luxor were prominent &#8212; the four closely grouped bright spots were impossible to miss. As we rounded large hills, we could barely see the faint beam of light from the Luxor as it rose into the night.<br />
Next thing I knew, we were blinded by a casino. Not just the sign of the casino, but the whole thing. I hadn&#8217;t seen that many lights before in my life in one place. I marveled at the sight. Stefan ho-hummed the casino, warning me that what I had just seen was nothing compared to what lay just beyond the hills surrounding the original &#8220;Sin City&#8221;.<br />
And he wasn&#8217;t kidding. About ten minutes later, we reached the crest of those hills. The bleak black landscape dropped away revealing a glowing, pulsating being of light. The city was alive with itself. It was like nothing I had ever seen before.<br />
In the summer of 1992 I was living in a house in Kanata, just outside of Ottawa. One of the occupants was a kindred student who had come from Acadia University in Nova Scotia to work for the summer. The largest city he had ever seen before was Halifax. With a population of only 115,000 people, Halifax is hardly the city that the Ottawa area creates. (The capital region has in excess of one million residents.) Driving eastward from Kanata along Highway 417 causes you to come over a rise, and at night the entire city and surrounding area glows with lights. My housemate thought the sight was impressive.<br />
Ottawa barely holds a smoldering wick compared to Las Vegas on a foggy night let alone the dry, clear evening we crossed the hills.<br />
Stefan and I immediately pulled the van over to the side of the highway and started rooting through the CD collection. I had planned in advance to bring some music that had the names of some of the places we would be visiting. Although I didn&#8217;t have the original Elvis version of the song, ZZ Top&#8217;s rendition of Viva Las Vegas, played at near-full volume, did as good a job. My skin tingled as we drove down the hill into the ocean of lights.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca had to arise to the occasion, they really didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The first order of business was finding out where the KOA was in relation to where we were. Stefan was desperate to take a quick tour of The Strip before turning in, and at first I honestly wanted to. But with every mile I kept driving, the more I wanted to stop and go to bed. Everyone else had slept, even if only a little. But I had been up for nearly 17 hours, most of that time on the road, and I was exhausted.<br />
I had to let Stefan down on that. I really didn&#8217;t want to, but I was just too damn tired to really care at that point. We found the exit at Boulder Highway, and started heading south. Almost immediately an enormous sign for the Boulder Station loomed around. It cast so much light I felt the highlights on the Behemoth weren&#8217;t doing much good. About a mile down the road, we found the KOA.<br />
We were justifiably surprised to find a guard booth about 20 metres from the road. Inside were two night guards watching TV and keeping an eye on the goings on about the campground. We pulled up and Stefan hopped out to get the arrangements of the night squared away. Although he actually got to talk with someone who seemed to know what was going on, it still took quite a while to fill out all the vital statistics (including the type of connection we wanted, the number of people in the van, the license plate, the colour, our average weight, height, sexual orientations, what mental state we were in, the amount of money we expected to lose at the casinos, and so forth).<br />
Of all the KOAs we saw, Las Vegas was the most impressive. A large amount of money had been spent to create a beautiful park-like interior with well-paved roads, washrooms every 100 metres on each of the roads, all the amenities that even the most cushy motorhome traveler could need. Palm trees lined the roads, brilliantly coloured fragrant flowers were strategically placed to add to the beauty.<br />
Our slot was right next to one of the washrooms, about 200 metres or so into the campground. Pulling in, I made quick work of hooking us up to the city utilities while the others made quick work of the toilets. It was already about 02:45 in the evening, but we weren&#8217;t anywhere near getting ready to go to bed. Unlike myself, the others were catching their second wind and wanted to see a casino as soon as possible. I contemplated not going and just going to sleep, but I remembered events that I had missed before on previous trips by going to bed &#8230; sleep be damned, I tagged along.<br />
Las Vegas at night was absolutely awesome, to quote Dhar&#8217;s description. It was comfortably warm, the exact temperature at night where if it were one degree warmer or cooler, it wouldn&#8217;t feel right. But here it was perfect. There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky &#8230; nor many stars for that matter &#8212; the city and casino lights were so bright that only the brightest shone through. The wind was but the slightest breeze, enough to remind me of some of my excursions to Florida in years past. Despite my exhaustion, it was too nice a night to sleep.<br />
We wandered back out to Boulder Highway, which wasn&#8217;t a highway at all, just a large four-lane road, and walked about a half-mile or so to the Boulder Station. Even from the KOA driveway the sign was clearly visible, scrolling texts and all. The lights from the sign were almost as bright as day, taking pictures of it was a dead-easy task.<br />
Rebecca turned towards the casino&#8217;s entrance wanting to see more. Remembering an episode of How&#8217;d They Do That? I suddenly realized that my camera could be a problem. Every casino in Las Vegas, or in the world for that matter, had security tighter than most top-secret government agencies. There was simply no way to cheat without the casino management from finding out. Every non-sanctioned device entering the casino could land you in some serious trouble. I saw no reason why my camera would be considered sanctioned.<br />
Apprehension aside, we went in. Immediately we were confronted with slot machines, which probably collectively outnumbered the population of Nevada by a two to one ratio. The tones, tunes, and tings of the machines immediately caused my auditory system to overload, there was simply too much information to process. The experience is like living in a room where the light is always a soft white, then after 20 years you go into a disco. No, even that doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. It&#8217;s more like taking a very prudish, sexually repressed person and dragging them into a live sex show and placing them in the front row seat.<br />
While my body tried to adjust to what I can only describe as culture shock, Dhar and Rebecca immediately sat down to try some video poker and slots. I had gone to Las Vegas with two ideas in mind: 1) Not to gamble at all, or 2) Spend $10 at the dollar slots and see what I could do. That night though, I wasn&#8217;t in any mental condition to do much else than observe the rest lose money.<br />
Correction: I expected them to lose money. It seems however that Dhar has a horseshoe wedged up his ass &#8212; I haven&#8217;t seen someone that lucky in a long time. He would walk up to nickel slot, pop in no more than two nickels, and win at least six more. By the time we left he had increased a single nickel he borrowed from Stefan into about two to three dollars&#8217; worth.<br />
Rebecca wasn&#8217;t quite so lucky. She won a couple times, but the evening overall wasn&#8217;t too successful and she lost money. Stefan took his chances only once or twice, while I stood and watched the casino floor.<br />
Never before had I seen such depravation. At somewhere around 03:00, there were still about a hundred or so people bent on winning money. As De Niro said in the movie Casino: &#8220;The longer you keep &#8217;em, the more they lose.&#8221; When you bet small, as we did, that statement wasn&#8217;t quite true. But the people who were there at 03:00 with their large plastic cups of coins, the heavy smokers sitting around the card tables, and the anxious Keno players weren&#8217;t your average players, they were addicts.<br />
There was a strange film that seemed to cover everything and everyone in that casino. All the employees seemed to have this dazed look about them, the patrons were blind, even the machines and tables looked slightly dingy. And the longer we stayed in there, the more I felt the same scum beginning to form on us.<br />
I thought that the feeling was just the casino, but I soon realized that it was the city. Lasvegasitis &#8230; gamblemania &#8230; autogreedatory response &#8230; call it what you will, the disease is unmistakable and it afflicts everyone in time. The first symptom is a slight aversion to the atmosphere of Las Vegas. The second symptom is the most dangerous: acceptance. The third is a desire to gamble, and is the most subtle of the symptoms. Without treatment, this often leads to the full-blown virus that causes you to lose sense of time, and your money.<br />
This was our first exposure, and we fortunately decided to cut it short before we got totally hooked. We continued to wander about the casino until we found a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts shop that was still open. I guess the die-hard gambler needs a caffeine and sugar fix every so often. The others stocked up on coffee and sweets while I watched. My body was sending me signals ordering me to bed. Eating a donut at the time would&#8217;ve caused a revolt that I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for at the time.<br />
Finishing the repast, we headed for the casino door and emerged into the comforting night. We crossed the immense parking lot surrounding the establishment, watching the security vehicles do their rounds. Reaching a gas station, Stefan and Dhar starting looking for the &#8220;magazines&#8221;. There were none to be found that night.<br />
The last time Stefan had been to Las Vegas, he had seen a magazine that advertised all the prostitutes in the area. I&#8217;m an open-minded person, but when I heard about this I was a little shocked. I think that strip bars are degrading towards women, and you don&#8217;t want to know what I think of prostitution. The fact that Nevada had no laws against it was a curiousity to me, but the existence of such a magazine was nothing short of exploitation.<br />
Upon returning to the van, the Captain Morgan&#8217;s came out of hiding. The only mixed drink I have ever had was a pseudo-screwdriver make with Five-Alive instead of orange juice. At the time I was already rather inebriated and really didn&#8217;t care what I was drinking. Here I was just too damn tired to do anything, let alone drink. The last of the Coke disappeared that night.<br />
We sat out at the picnic table next to our van and began to talk about anything that came to mind. But no matter how hard I tried to concentrate, my mind kept wandering to thoughts of slumber. After ten minutes I gave up on the struggle and announced I was going to bed.<br />
Although the night was warm, sleeping in a sleeping bag would&#8217;ve been too warm. The 110 volt air conditioner received its first trial that evening. I barely managed to get a log entry in before falling asleep.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplementary</strong><br />
I have seen the face of depraved greed and despair. Thy name is Las Vegas. Inspiring as it was to arrive with ZZ Top blaring, nothing could prepare me for what I saw, or what I&#8217;ll soon see.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dawn arrives early at high altitudes, but we didn&#8217;t notice until around 09:00 that morning. Dawn also arrives very cold. When we went to bed, the temperature was something in the neighbourhood of 10 degrees Celsius. Not terribly warm, but when you&#8217;ve been having cold temperatures for six months, 10 degrees is not too bad. When we woke up the next morning, the temperature was somewhere close to zero.<br />
I woke after Dhar. I don&#8217;t know how long he had been up, but no sooner than I had opened my eyes that he was looking back. Both Stefan and Rebecca were asleep, showing no signs of immediate arousal. I raised the window curtain next to me and peered out into the early Colorado morning. The clouds that had shrouded Pikes Peak the previous day were gone, the sky was a perfection of blue. The sun cast long shadows but shone directly on the front of the van, lighting the interior.<br />
Immediately I noticed the cold. I hadn&#8217;t felt this since I had last gone camping. It was a damp cold too, mostly from the condensation inside the van. Most of the ceiling and windows were covered with large beads of water. I wondered if it was from humid air that we had somehow brought with us (not too likely considering how often the windows were open), or from our breathing. Either way, there was about a litre of moisture on the walls.<br />
A rustling of the sheets behind me and a few mumbled words indicated that at least one of our two remaining sleepers was beginning the agonizing stages of waking up. As it turned out we placed the two worst morning people together &#8212; a marriage of convenience, if you will. Both Stefan and Rebecca take forever to get up in the morning, though Rebecca is about a hundred times worse than her other half. The irony was Rebecca continually complained of Stefan&#8217;s lack of motion in the morning, yet he was always up before her.<br />
Dhar and I took this sign as an opportunity to draw all the curtains and go outside and see what morning in the Rockies felt like. I could hear mumbled protests from in and under sleeping bags and pillows about not only the noise, but the sudden increase in the light level.<br />
Colorado Springs is the only place I have ever been that had crisp air that wasn&#8217;t in the middle of winter. Normally, that crisp feeling only comes at some God-awful point in the winter when it&#8217;s so cold your nostril hairs freeze when you breathe through your nose. Except for the temperature and the frozen nostril hairs, Colorado Springs had that same feeling when you breathed.<br />
I smiled to myself, a remnant of a much earlier trip. When I had gone to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1989, Keith Black, the tour group leader, had continually said: &#8220;Smile, you&#8217;re in a different country.&#8221; (See [[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Introduction|My Trip to the Soviet Union]]) The United States is old news for a Canadian living so near to the border and has visited a few states. But nothing I had seen or experienced before prepared me for the sights of the Midwest. I smiled because for the first time, I really knew what Keith Black had meant.<br />
I had noticed Fountain Creek when we had arrived the night before, but hadn&#8217;t really bothered to take a look at it. The creek bed lay about 100 feet directly in front of the van, just to the east of where we were. The creek was low, and might even run dry during the summer months. The winter run-off had already come and gone, as the washed back grasses and debris testified to. The creek couldn&#8217;t have been more than a foot deep, but was probably only a couple degrees above freezing.<br />
Suddenly to my left, I saw something move. Looking over, I saw a medium-sized cat. At first I thought it was a wild cat, considering how it had lurched when I arrived. But when I got a good look at it, I realized that it had been a tourist&#8217;s cat that had gone feral.<br />
I was reminded of a book I had read, Tony Hillerman&#8217;s Skinwalkers. It&#8217;s a story of Navajo Tribal Policemen trying to solve a bizarre string of murders &#8230; a fairly typical plot idea. One of the main characters keeps a sort of watch over a feral cat that moves into a shelter near his trailer. Hillerman described the cat in a very specific way: under-nourished; looking like it had been well-bred; and very wild looking, like it was relying on its wits for survival.<br />
The cat before me was a domestic breed, but not a pure bred. It was definitely not a wild cat. Not yet. How long it had been in the wild I couldn&#8217;t tell &#8212; it was either a quick learner or a very good hunter. Either way, the cat seemed much better off than its literary cousin. It shared the same wild look in its eyes, which shone brighter than the sun. I know house cats, this cat was now closer to being a puma than a pussy.<br />
When I got back Stefan had finally pulled himself out of the bed, and was finding all the stuff he needed to have a shower. I decided to follow suit. I quickly realized however that my towel was still very damp from the night before (it really hadn&#8217;t dried during the night, which may also explain all the condensation on the walls and ceiling). Having a shower would obviously make me feel better, but I would have no way of drying myself off. Rebecca mumbled a nearly coherent idea about the hand dryers in the washrooms.<br />
I collected my toiletries and followed Dhar over to the washrooms. Alas, a hand dryer was nowhere to be found. I sighed and returned to the van, accidentally forgetting my shampoo on the counter. Stefan was entering the bathroom just as I left. When I got back, the doors were locked. My initial thought was that Stefan and Rebecca had locked themselves in. As it happened, Stefan had locked the door leaving Rebecca behind while he showered.<br />
Rebecca was still in bed when I knocked on a side window and announced that whatever it was that Stefan and Rebecca were doing would have to wait. When Rebecca opened the door, she gave me a bit of an odd look. I attributed it to her not quite hearing what I had said, and her general lack of alertness (Rebecca was not a morning person, especially without a large cup of coffee within arm&#8217;s reach). Rebecca promptly turned around, walked back to the rear of the van and buried herself in the sleeping bags, mumbling something about never waking up again.<br />
When Stefan returned, he looked much like a drowned rat who had tried to dry off by shaking the water from its fur. I don&#8217;t know how Stefan always managed to look like that, but I&#8217;ll give him one thing: he was consistent. He immediately apologized for forgetting that he had locked the van when he left. Rebecca grabbed her things and the infamous &#8220;purple bag&#8221; of toiletries from Stefan, and left to do her thing in the washroom. Dhar arrived a moment later and handed me a large beige bottle of Pantene shampoo. I mentally kicked myself in the rear for forgetting it.<br />
Having some of the Behemoth&#8217;s members back gave me the opportunity to give a quick call home. I hadn&#8217;t wanted to do so during the day, considering how much it would cost, but I knew full well that it would be rather difficult to coordinate my times with my parents. They didn&#8217;t like anyone calling after 22:00, so I chose the lesser of two evils and would call at 09:00 &#8230; 11:00 their time.<br />
I wandered over to the pay phone at the back of the KOA office, carrying my daily planner (which, as you&#8217;ll remember from two chapters ago, was doubling as our expenses log during the trip &#8230; not that this particular detail is of any use on this particular occasion) so I could jot down my medical insurance number in case my mother had managed to find it. Taking a suggestion from Stefan, I used the 1-800-Collect(r) service to get through to home. I found it not only a lot easier to use than the system I had used the day before (all I had to do was key in my home number), but also a lot faster to connect.<br />
This time my mother wasn&#8217;t panicky when she picked up the phone. This was probably because I told her I would call when I got to Colorado. It wasn&#8217;t entirely true, I had to call her sometime later, but I was keeping with my word. She hadn&#8217;t found my insurance number. This wasn&#8217;t surprising considering the condition of my room when I left (which, as my mother would often comment, befitting of the local waste disposal site). She asked me the typical questions: &#8220;How are you?&#8221;, &#8220;What are you eating?&#8221;, &#8220;Did you sleep well?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you wearing clean underwear?&#8221;<br />
I kept the conversation short for two reasons: 1) It was expensive calling long distance from the States during the day, even if 1-800-Collect(r) said you could save up to 40% on the call (shameless plug); and 2) My mother&#8217;s questions always annoyed the hell out of me. Hanging up, I walked around to the front of the office to buy postcards.<br />
KOAs make life very simple: everything you need is at arm&#8217;s reach &#8230; though not quite so literally. All of them carried postcards and stamps, although the staff wasn&#8217;t always on the ball with how much postage cost. Normally 40 cents (American), I was first quoted 20 cents in Colorado Springs, and 50 cents when we hit Albuquerque.<br />
The clerk at the desk was the same one we had dealt with the night before. I bid her a good morning as I set about the task of selecting appropriate postcards. At first I was going to buy five cards every place we stayed, one for my parents and one for my close friends at home: Scott, Tara, Chris and Kathryn. But as I quickly learned, many of the places we stayed (including the KOA) had the ol&#8217; four-for-a-buck deal. Now I don&#8217;t want to sound cheap, but saving money on postcards was a blessing, since I sent over $20 (American) of postcards and stamps home. Scott and Tara (who were seeing each other &#8230; and still are) were lumped together.<br />
I chose pictures of Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, miscellaneous mountains, and the tackiest postcard I could find. Scott had challenged me to send him all the tacky (or as he had said, &#8220;cheesy&#8221;) postcards to him that I could find. This proved to be a huge challenge, since for some reason good-looking postcards had become more popular than the bad ones.<br />
Having chosen my cards, I asked the clerk for postage. At the time I had no idea of how much postage to get. Unfortunately, neither did the clerk. But she said that 20 cents would get me just about anywhere, so I bought four 20 cents stamps. I filed the stamps and postcards in my organizer so I wouldn&#8217;t lose them and promptly started to head back to the van. Just as I was leaving, I thought to see if a postbox was nearby. The clerk indicated a small stand-up box just outside the door.<br />
Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar were sitting at the picnic table next to the van, poring over the maps we had, and arguing about where we would be going next. Stefan&#8217;s desire to stay in Colorado and travel about the different canyons and natural sights was being shot down by both Rebecca and Dhar. (No, Stefan hadn&#8217;t relented from the argument we all engaged in two days earlier.) I decided it wasn&#8217;t necessary for me to put a word in since my goals were being met through the dual attack. After only a minute or two, Stefan finally gave up and capitulated to figuring out where we were to go next.<br />
The TripTik provided by CAA was promptly pitched on a shelf &#8212; we were going to do the route the way we wanted to do it. Actually, the way they wanted to do it. I personally wanted to follow the TripTik because it would save us time in getting to our destination, which I assumed to be Las Vegas. I hadn&#8217;t yet shaken my habit of efficiency and punctuality.<br />
This was a problem for me, I loved efficiency. If there&#8217;s one thing I really couldn&#8217;t stand, it was wasting time driving the long way to a place. When I planned road trips, it was using a modified MST, a computer term for Minimum Spanning Tree. In plain English, this is the shortest combined distance (or measure) along a given series of points. In our case, the overall shortest distance meant we would first go to Las Vegas, then hit the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon. That was by my methods.<br />
I will be the first to point out that my methods aren&#8217;t always the best ones. And this was just such an example. The route according to the TripTik was to go south on Highway 115 to Highway 50, where we would travel almost due west until we reached Grand Junction, where we would pick up I-70. This would take us to I-15, which would take us directly to Las Vegas. But in doing so, we would have missed some of the most spectacular scenery I have ever seen. At some point in your life, you need to stop and smell the roses, or you miss living. The roses were especially sweet that day.<br />
So Stefan got at least part of his wish, which was to take a scenic route through the Rockies to Cortez, Colorado. There we would spend the night before heading to the Grand Canyon. But more on that when I get to it.<br />
Before we would leave, we decided that we should see something of Colorado Springs. The two principle things on our list were the Cave of the Winds and Pikes Peak. According to the AAA Colorado TourBook, Pikes Peak ran a Cog Railway to the top, but only in good weather. The Cave of the Winds was supposedly open all year long, but in any case I wanted to check. While the others continued to bicker over what roads we were going to take, I headed over to the phone.<br />
Interesting Fact: American phones don&#8217;t take Canadian quarters. Americans in general tend to dislike Canadian change. We found this out a few times when we accidentally (honestly!) mixed a couple Canadian pennies in with our American change. This (luckily) never happened to me, but Dhar and Rebecca both were scolded for &#8220;attempting to cheat&#8221; a retailer. I, purely out of curiousity, wanted to see if a Canadian quarter would work.<br />
According to the receptionist at Pikes Peak, the cog railway had not run the 09:00 run due to snow on the tracks. The receptionist didn&#8217;t know if the 13:00 train would run for the same reason, but suggested I call back at 12:00 to find out. This unfortunately ruled a trip to the top of Pikes Peak out because we simply didn&#8217;t have the time, at least in my humble opinion. Cave of the Winds was open, and all tours were running normally at regular intervals.<br />
I relayed this information to my comrades, who were still in disagreement about the routes. (For the record, this was the only time we had a real debate about which way we would go. For some reason, the rest of the United States was not a point of contention.) Stefan was dead set on the scenic route. I was more for the more direct approach, but agreed that the scenic route was a possibility provided we had the time to drive it. Then Dhar and Rebecca gave in and agreed to the deal. The majority won. I lost. Stefan smiled broadly &#8212; he finally got something to go his way for a change.<br />
We began the procedure of packing up. I went around to the driver&#8217;s side of the van to disconnect the hose and electrical cord. I quickly realized that someone had turned the water off in the night, assumedly to prevent hoses from bursting &#8212; a wise precaution. Following my father&#8217;s instructions, I blew any extra water out of the hoses, coiled the hose and connected the ends together to prevent any dirt or bugs from collecting inside. I also put away the propane tank, having found that it resealed itself during the night. At first I thought it might have been due to the cold, but I had let it sit in the sun for about an hour, and no further leakage appeared.<br />
Following another of my father&#8217;s instructions, I checked the van&#8217;s oil and engine coolant. My father is a stickler for things like that, particularly when cars are involved. My father does most of the maintenance on our vehicles, and in a way he expects me to be like him. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I work on computers, not cars. I actually prefer biking whenever possible.<br />
The van roared to life minutes later. My father drilled into our family to always let a car engine warm up before going anywhere, just to make sure there&#8217;s no strain on the engine&#8217;s parts. While the engine warmed, we filled several left over two litre plastic Coke bottles so we would have an ample water supply. Stefan warned us that we would dehydrate quickly at the altitudes we would be traveling at. I, for one, was not willing to take risks like that.<br />
I took first shift driving, and our first stop was the pump station. Although we never used our toilet, the washing of the dishes, my brushing my teeth, and the general use of the sink faucet had collected a lot of water in the gray water tank, which I wanted to dump before gallivanting around the Rockies. Rebecca and Stefan headed to the KOA office to get postcards and whatnot, Dhar stuck around to watch.<br />
Pumping stations are usually fairly simple things: a hole in the ground (into a holding tank) with a water hose to wash any spillage. The smell is absolutely atrocious. If you&#8217;ve ever used an outhouse, imagine a smell 100 times worse. I never want to know about the things that end up in a holding tank.<br />
Under the driver door is a running board step. This step is hinged and flips up to reveal the van&#8217;s propane tank with its valve, and the sewage hose with the tank valve handles. Unscrewing a small cap and pulling back a metal plate releases the hose from its tube, pulling out to a distance of about ten feet. But since I parked right next to the holding tank cover, I needed only a couple feet. I pulled back on the handles and dumped our dirty water.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were still milling around inside the office when we got there. Dhar and I went in to see what they were doing. I took the opportunity to purchase another four twenty cent stamps to correct the oversight on my postcards.<br />
I dropped the postcards in the drop box on our way out, boarded the van, and prepared to head back up I-25 to Cave of the Winds. The trip back was a little on the convoluted side, with all the off-ramps and road construction, but soon we found Highway 24 and started heading west. Unlike the day before, we didn&#8217;t cross over to Colorado Avenue, since we would have had to remerge onto Highway 24 further down.<br />
After a little while we found the exit for Cave of the Winds. It was in fact, a set of stoplights. We turned right and started heading up a road up the side of a mountain. A sign at the entrance told us to ask for assistance if we were driving a large vehicle. However the booths at the base of the mountain, where the help was supposed to be, were vacant. I sighed to myself, shifted into a lower gear, and prepared to see if I could keep ourselves from sliding off the road into a fiery death.<br />
The incline of the road varied but was at least a 6% grade, probably extending into the double digits in a few places. The road was narrow too, so I had to be extra specially careful when going around corners to make sure I didn&#8217;t fall off the edge. To top it all off, the road zig-zagged its way up the side of the mountain. It made Lombard Street in San Francisco look like a straight-away.<br />
The others oohed and aahed as I slowly guided our way up. I kept my eyes glued firmly to the road, not wanting to be distracted by a damn thing. Only once did I have to pass a car coming down, and for that I was thankful. I once caught a glimpse of the edge of the road, and frankly, it scared the hell out of me.<br />
When we reached the top, we drove around to a pull-through parking spot and climbed out. We weren&#8217;t too sure what we should wear inside, but I took the precaution and wore my shoes. Caves tend to keep a constant temperature, and it&#8217;s usually cooler than on the surface. Rebecca and Stefan wore sandals. Dhar would wear shoes until Las Vegas, and would hardly ever take off his jeans.<br />
The view from up there was amazing, but a neighbouring ridge blocked our view of Colorado Springs. I snapped off a few shots of the camera before we headed towards the Cave&#8217;s entrance. Along the way we found the grandstands used for the laser light show, something we were two weeks too early to see, and a miniature replica of an old-West saloon for kids to crawl through.<br />
The Cave entrance was a building built on the side of the mountain. On its main level was a lounge, containing flyers for other attractions, a love tester, and a black hole simulator for coins. Any good tourist trap needs to have a black hole simulator. Below the lounge was an arcade which according to Stefan had an old Zaxxon video game machine. Across from the building&#8217;s entrance was the gift shop, were we would get our tickets for the trip.<br />
We would be a part of tour 13. Lucky us. The shop was heavily unpopulated, containing a small handful of tourists, almost as many clerks, and a couple repairmen getting the store ready for tourist season. I guesses that tourist season had not opened yet. (Be vewy, vewy quiet. We&#8217;re hunting tourists. Hehehehehehe.)<br />
We opted for the Discovery Tour, a 40 minute quickie of the Caves. Also available was the Lantern Tour, which was slightly longer than our tour and performed completely with dimly lit lanterns; and the Wild Tour, a 6 hour trek through the mud and muck that makes up the harder to access parts of the cave. Ours was the cheapest, the quickest, and probably the cleanest (the brochures recommended that you wear coveralls and bring a change of clothes if you take the Wild Tour).<br />
We had to wait about 15 minutes before our tour left. This gave us time (perhaps too much) to wander about the store and see what there was. We found all sorts of tacky tourist souvenirs, including a series of cedar hand paddles with cute comments such as &#8220;Attitude Adjuster&#8221; and &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Little Helper&#8221;. I found an interesting law framed on one of the walls. Desecrating the cave (that is, breaking any of the natural formations or writing on the walls) resulted in a $500 fine and a potential 30 days in jail. I read the particulars, but nearly choked when I read that the law had been written in the mid-1800&#8217;s. That law was still in effect.<br />
Slightly below the legal notice was something I had considered a relic of times past: a sign indicating a fallout shelter. I had to point this out to (I believe it was) Stefan, remarking that the idea seemed a bit absurd. I was referring to the use of the sign at all, not the fact that the cave was a designated shelter. Stefan seemed to misinterpret my meaning, and replied that a cave would be an ideal shelter. This I never doubted, but the fact that the sign still existed was both curious and worrisome.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca both bought lollipops. Nothing in that action was overly interesting, only that the lollipops were all-natural and hand-made. Rebecca&#8217;s was a chocolate and peanut butter flavour, one that I must admit is unusual. Rebecca, originally enthralled with the idea, quickly found that the flavour was none too inviting.<br />
When the boarding call came we proceeded to a door on the north side of the gift shop, next to the frame that held the law. We handed over the little plastic tour tickets to the attendant then walked out to a small porch. There we waited until the tour guide appeared. He looked young, probably in his mid-20&#8217;s or so, and strongly built &#8212; this guide either worked out a lot, or did far too much spelunking for his own good.<br />
He gave us a quick run down of the rules, mostly involving desecration of the cave. A couple words about chewing gum, and then he noticed Dhar and Rebecca sucking on their lollipops. They too were a no-no (the lollipops, not my compatriots), and were quickly tucked away in bags wrapped in waxed paper.<br />
The entrance to the cave was through a short tunnel apparently dug out of the side of the mountain to allow for easier access to tourists. The original cave entrance, used by the two boys who discovered it, was further down the side of the mountain and much harder to use.<br />
The cave was not at all what I expected. Most of my knowledge of caves came from the pages of National Geographic, television documentaries, and whatever books I happened to read. (And people wonder when I describe myself as a nerd &#8230; go figure!) All of them depicted rock or dirt floors, lots of running water, stalactites and stalagmites, crystal formations, and little unnatural lighting. In other words, caves that had seen little of mankind. Cave of the Winds was a commercial cave, not run by the U.S. Park Service. It was &#8220;improved&#8221; to make it more accessible to tourists.<br />
The first stop was less than 20 feet into the cave, where the tour operators had a camera set up to take pictures of the tour members. Almost everyone on the tour were couples, except for a single elderly man (whose wife didn&#8217;t want to go into the cave), a couple with their toddler, and our group of four. In all there were about fifteen people in the tour group. The picture was nothing special, we were officially known as Group 13D, and would see our picture when we got out. This I found rather interesting since I knew that it would take nearly 30 minutes just to develop the film. The 8.5 x 11 pictures would take almost as long (under normal circumstances), and the tour was only about 45 minutes. (One of the advantages of having worked at a Black&#8217;s Camera shop is you pick up these things &#8212; the absolute fastest we could develop film was 45 minutes.)<br />
The first point of the actual tour was a large room about 100 feet long, about 40 wide and sloping from about 10 to 40 feet high. Here we were shown the original entrance, since barred over to prevent people getting stuck or lost. Also here was a time capsule, to be opened around the year 2080. The tour guide invited one and all to come back to witness its contents. We happily laughed at an otherwise lame joke.<br />
And so we walked down the concrete pathways with their aluminum, brass, and iron railings; up the concrete steps; marveled at the coloured lights that shone on the broken cave formations. I actually felt sorry for the cave, having to put up with humans continually wandering through, leaving behind their mark. I&#8217;m not a rabid environmentalist, but I&#8217;m not for destroying the world. As a camper, I strongly believe in leaving things as they were found, leaving nothing behind. I would have been much happier seeing the cave with lanterns, knowing how little of it had been changed.<br />
The Cave of the Winds holds the record for America&#8217;s highest commercial cave. I assumed that means that there are other caves higher than Cave of the Winds that are protected by the U.S. Park Service, but chose not to clarify the tour guide&#8217;s statements.<br />
Some parts of the cave were interesting. On one of the ceilings were a series of cave flowers, which are crystal formations that grow out like flowers. To prevent people from trying to pick them, the tour operators covered the flowers with wire mesh. Albeit ugly, the mesh kept the flowers for all to see, at least what was left of them. Many of the flowers were visibly broken or altogether missing.<br />
Fat Man&#8217;s Misery / Tall Man&#8217;s Agony was a rather interesting place to visit. It was so named due to its low ceiling (requiring tall people to almost have to walk through on all fours) and its narrow width. Only children could enter the passage without having to bend or crouch. I couldn&#8217;t help but call out &#8220;Everybody limbo!&#8221; like a boisterous Ricardo Montalban as I entered the passage.<br />
The Cave of the Winds, despite its name, was formed mostly through water pressure. Many caves (such as Mammoth Cave) are formed through water erosion, which although similar in nature, is still different. Natural erosion takes place over hundreds of thousands of years; water dripping and seeping through cracks eventually opens chambers. Under water pressure, the sheer force of water eroded the cave, most likely in a shorter span of time. When Cave of the Winds was formed, it was much closer to sea level than it is now. Many parts of the cave showed this erosion through pressure, the swirls and indentations of the currents were plain to see.<br />
We exited the cave nearly an hour after entering, leaving the cool 58 degrees Fahrenheit behind and returning to a much warmer 75 degrees. Upon exiting, our pictures were ready. The picture was nothing special, a simple 8.5 x 11 inch photo in a stiff paper frame. I was tempted to ask if we could buy the negative rather than the picture. That notwithstanding, Dhar bought the picture.<br />
We wandered about the gift shop for a few minutes while Dhar got his change from the store. Rebecca took the opportunity to buy some homemade fudge that the store sold. She was a bit confused about the flavour she was buying, since she had never heard of a Heath Bar. In Canada, we know the Heath Bar better as a Skor candy bar. I find the name &#8220;Heath&#8221; a rather interesting one for a candy bar, since the word &#8220;heath&#8221; means &#8220;wasteland&#8221;. (Part of the joys of being an English major.) Incidentally, the fudge was magnificent.<br />
The drive back down the mountain was not quite as nerve-wracking as the trip up, although I&#8217;m not too sure why. This time, I could see down the mountain, and it should have frightened me half to death. Maybe it was that I could see where I was going (the way up was mostly obscured by the cliffs). But the van remained in second gear the whole time to keep it from moving too fast, my foot firmly on the brake.<br />
The next issue was food. Not necessarily lunch, but food from which we could make meals. We opted not to return to Colorado Springs, but continue west on Highway 24 until we found a more appropriate place to buy our nourishment. When we reached Woodland Park about twenty minutes later, Dhar was too hungry to wait any longer.<br />
McDonald&#8217;s is not exactly known for their fine cuisine. In fact, a Big Mac is almost at the bottom of things I would eat when given a choice. But Dhar was in the mood for a McChicken &#8230; or a Filet O&#8217; Fish, one of those dumbly named sandwiches. I wasn&#8217;t too hungry and decided that a couple cheeseburgers would fill the void that was forming in my stomach.<br />
School was out for lunch. Everywhere I looked were high school students, and most of them looked rather undeveloped &#8212; I figured the hamburgers they were eating had higher IQs. As I looked around the establishment, I followed Stefan&#8217;s gaze to a family eating lunch. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so interesting as it was to realize that the family was wearing what appeared to be their Sunday best, and had dragged Grandma along for the ride. I shook my head silently, not understanding how someone could classify Raunchy Ron&#8217;s as good eating.<br />
Mind you, this particular McDonald&#8217;s seemed to be caught in a bit of a time warp (though none quite so severe as the Kansas Interspatial Distortion). On the wall next to the door next to the door we had entered through was a Mac Tonight sign. I suddenly had a flashback to the failed ad campaign McDonald&#8217;s launched in the mid-80&#8217;s to get people to eat at McDonald&#8217;s for dinner. The waning moon-head of the character was oddly disturbing, even more so when I was surrounded by people that some anthropologists might consider throwbacks to the Stone Age.<br />
We didn&#8217;t leave for quite some time, Dhar&#8217;s order took a while. Even when we did leave, we had to come back to retrieve the sandwiches he forgot. What a silly bunt! We continued along Highway 24, now looking for two things: a grocery store and a liquor store. (But you don&#8217;t even know her!) We didn&#8217;t even need to leave Woodland Park to fill that need. Stefan and I waited while Rebecca and Dhar shopped for sustenance. This gave me a chance to finish my lunch.<br />
I can eat a Canadian McDonald&#8217;s cheeseburger regardless of what its temperature is, or when it was made. The cheeseburgers I had just bought were freshly made (I had seen them made), but tasted horrible. American beef has a lot of fat and hormones in it, that is fact. Beyond that, I don&#8217;t know what else it could have been. The meat was like gray mush, there was only one lousy pickle, and the onions had no flavour. It was the worst hamburger &#8230; sorry, cheeseburger that I had ever eaten. It was the last American hamburger I ate during the entire trip.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what Dhar and Rebecca were doing, but they took nearly a half hour to buy a few bags of food. That included cans of corn and green beans, pancake mix, popcorn, tortillas, chicken, hot dog buns, green peppers, orange juice, and my personal favourite: fruit loops. Not the Kellogg version, but some knock-off that was cheaper, but just as high in sugar content.<br />
While Rebecca and I saw to the storing of the food, Dhar and Stefan saw to the purchasing of alcoholic substances: Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, and a large bottle of cheap wine. Neither exactly my flavour.<br />
Stefan guided me out of the parking spot (which had me on an angle pointing down a hill), and out into the driving lane. A few moments later and we were once again heading west on Highway 24. The day was bright, the air was warm, and we had almost seven hours and over 6,000 feet of elevation to traverse before arriving in Cortez later that night. By this time I had accepted the scenic route as the decided course, and on such a day it was not to be a course to be forgotten.<br />
The lack of clouds in the sky, the snowy caps of the mountains, the immense conifer forests became absolutely breathtaking. The roads wound in, around and through the hills and valleys that made up the Rocky mountains and the plains that exist between the ranges. Several times we stopped for pictures and to look at the beauty without the obstruction of the van. It wasn&#8217;t long before we left Highway 24 and started on Highway 50.<br />
Our highest point was Monarch Pass, which we arrived at about two hours after leaving Woodland Park. At 11,312 feet above sea level, both the Behemoth and I were having problems getting a good breath of oxygen. I felt a little light headed. We stopped as we crept up the pass, pulling over to the side for a while to have a brief snowball fight. The last time I had run around in the snow in my shorts had been about three years earlier when I was visiting a friend in Montreal. And this time I wasn&#8217;t even wearing my shoes &#8212; they were tucked away somewhere in the closet, I was wearing my sandals sans socks.<br />
Stefan took over driving from that point. I concentrated on seeing things I had never seen before. Rebecca and Dhar retreated to the back of the van to play cards, as they were very prone to doing. Stefan seemed to get really annoyed at this, he was very enthusiastic about all the nature we were seeing, and all Rebecca and Dhar could do was play cards. I stayed out of the argument, preferring to watch the world pass us by.<br />
Driving down the pass was almost as much fun as driving up. Stefan kept the van in second gear pretty much the whole way down, not wanting to burn out the brakes as we descended. Fortunately, the pass isn&#8217;t widely traveled and traffic was fairly low. The odd semi-trailer would drive it, and we usually passed them going in the opposite direction. Though just as we were exiting, we ran into one.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take Stefan long to get around it, the van having found new life at 9,000 feet, and we quickly found ourselves in the middle of cattle country. Everywhere we looked were cows, steers, and the odd bison. It seemed that it was breeding time too, as one bull on our right quickly told us. Outside of nature documentaries, I had never actually seen animals on the verge of mating. To be honest, I was envious &#8212; animals make it look so easy, they don&#8217;t have to deal with all the bullshit surrounding human relationships.<br />
One bull suddenly started gushing fluids from its groin, and it started to mount one of the cows. Rebecca sounded almost like a giddy schoolgirl witnessing sex for the first time. She shrieked about &#8220;how large it is&#8221;. I had to feel sorry for Stefan, that somewhere he felt he was being compared to an animal whose phallus resembled a metre-long heat seeking moisture missile. (Metaphor intended.)<br />
About halfway along Highway 50, just outside Gunnison, we stopped for pictures at a kind of picnic area. The road into the small park had an interesting feature that I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and that we saw almost continually until we reached Louisiana: a large steel grating made of parallel bars. It ran between the fence posts at either side of the road. I was justifiably curious, not knowing what it was. Stefan was quick to explain that animals, particularly cloven ones, are unable to cross the grating. It saves money as you don&#8217;t have to build or maintain a gate.<br />
The roadway inside the tiny reserve was poor, not likely having been repaired in some time. But the park did have one thing that I found useful &#8212; a Johnny-On-The-Spot. Not exactly the Ritz as far as the smell is concerned, but a welcome relief nonetheless.<br />
The view from the lookout was breathtaking. The lookout was perched right on the edge of a hill, which quickly dropped just below us. Just a few miles ahead was Gunnison, laying part way into a vast plain. Across it were more mountains. I took out the panoramic for another picture, pausing just before taking it when I had a much better idea.<br />
I had Rebecca, Dhar and Stefan position themselves in the middle and at the edges of the viewfinder so that they effectively split the picture in three. As it turned out, the picture looked pretty good (for a disposable camera with a cheap plastic lens), although I found that the viewfinder is a little smaller than the lens&#8217; view when I saw the picture two weeks later.<br />
Just outside Gunnison, on the other side of town, we came across the Blue Mesa reservoir. Somewhere down river, one of the Governments (either State or Federal) had built a dam, creating the reservoir. But this reservoir was strangely depleted. We had arrived at the reservoir just following the spring run-off, during which a reservoir should be filled almost to the limit. Yet the water level was at least 30 feet below what appeared to be the normal water line.<br />
Huge strips of land connected what would normally be islands with the shore. Exposed lake bed glowed a yellowish-brown, marked with a few large rocks every so often. Stefan and I commented to each other repeatedly about the water level, several times trying to get Rebecca and Dhar to express any interest in the phenomenon. But they were too engrossed in their card game to really care too much.<br />
After cross a bridge to the south side of the reservoir, we stopped a little ways down at an interesting mesa hillside visible on the north side of the reservoir. Erosion had cut tall fingers out of the hill, creating a sort of effect of someone having dragged a huge comb through the soil.<br />
About an hour later we reached Montrose, where Highway 50 ended. The sun was beginning to set on us, and I was beginning to have serious doubts of getting to Cortez before 20:00 that evening. A quick calculation proved that the earliest we could get there was at 21:30, well past the KOA&#8217;s office hours. We turned onto Highway 550 for our half-hour trip to Ridgway where we would pick up Route 62, continuing the Scenic Route.<br />
The shadows grew long, hiding all the trees and cliffs. Soon all around us was darkness, and a desperate need to go to the bathroom. Montrose looked deserted when we passed it, so we had to continue in our quest for relief. I suggested we get familiar with the on-board toilet. However, a certain member of our regiment steadfastly insisted she could last.<br />
Soon we reached Route 145, which would take us indirectly to Cortez. I refuse to say &#8220;directly&#8221; because the road weaved in and out of hills and valleys in a huge zig-zag. The first major bend was just outside of Telluride, where we found an open gas station. Although we didn&#8217;t need any fuel, we all needed to relieve ourselves and stock up on liquids and chocolate, the latter being a not-so-good idea.<br />
The moon was out that night, and was very bright. Unfortunately, it was hard to see it amongst all the trees. Dhar took over from Stefan, who took over navigating from me. I perched myself behind Stefan and peered out the windows to try and see anything in the dark. Through rare breaks in the trees I could see valleys, small mountain peaks, and the odd house. Otherwise, it was a series of black blobs.<br />
About 30 miles out of Cortez, we finally hit some excitement. As we came around a corner, we saw the flashing lights of a police car, in this case a Bronco. A cop had set up flares and positioned his car to prevent people from hitting a small landslide that had blocked part of the lane we were driving in. Dhar passed the cop slowly, allowing us to peer out at what we might have hit had the cop not been there to warn us. It was then that I realized just how dangerous that part of the trip had been. A heaving run-off could have dislodged a large rock, taking out the van with a single blow.<br />
The excitement didn&#8217;t end there however. About ten miles later, we caught a glimpse of the clean-up crew racing to the landslide. The first vehicle in line was a dumptruck with a plow on the front. I don&#8217;t know how fast he was going, but he came within a foot of hitting us, enough to make the four of us hold our breaths for a moment, then swear in unison that we weren&#8217;t all killed. Almost right behind the truck was a front-end loader that kept his distance.<br />
Almost as quickly as we entered the mountains, we exited them. Before us were the lights of Cortez, a city of only 7,300, but with enough lights to block out some of the stars in the sky. We pulled over just outside of the forests and gazed up for a few moments. Stefan remarked that Rainy River was much better, having no lights brighter than a 100 watt bulb. We piled back in and kept on driving.<br />
Route 145 ended at Highway 160, which coincidentally enough was where the KOA was located. We turned left, drove about 100 feet, and headed in for a late check-in. Stefan gathered up his wallet, bounded out the door, and went over to be frustrated by the late check-in booth. This was the first time we had ever checked in late, so this was a whole new experience for Stefan.<br />
He stared at the instructions for a few minutes, then came back for a pen he could write with. I never asked Stefan if he knew what on Earth he was doing, I figured he&#8217;d always answer &#8220;yes&#8221; regardless if he did or not. But it always took quite a while to get checked in every night we came in late. I don&#8217;t know if it was a result of him trying to figure out the cost when the discount was figured in or not, but nonetheless it took a while. Eventually, he returned with a map of the camp, indicating where we were to park.<br />
We drove almost all the way around the park before we finally found the right slot. Then we drove around to the other side so we could properly pull through. Once Dhar had us in place, I hopped out with the keys and proceeded to get us hooked up.<br />
Dinner had us in a heated discussion for about ten minutes before deciding on peanut butter and honey sandwiches. None of us were in the mood for cooking, and were all pretty tapped out from all the driving we had done that day. I figured in part the lack of will was due to us not being comfortable at the high altitude. During the day, we had traveled over 10,000 feet vertically (over 5,000 up and another 5,000 down) and all the pressure change had my ears nearly ringing.<br />
To go along with our light meal was the wine Stefan and Dhar had purchased in Woodland Park. Three large plastic cups were partially filled with the cheap spirits, whilst I drank of Coke. I normally don&#8217;t mind wine (at least not since I started drinking at New Year&#8217;s that year), but the kind I prefer starts at $20 a litre. The gallon they bought was around $4.<br />
The sandwiches filled a nutritional void that needed to be filled, we were quite satisfied that we could now go to sleep without a serious argument from our stomachs. Stefan and I were undoubtedly a different situation, but the both of us would agree that even a little food is much better than no food at all. One other advantage with making sandwiches was a minimalist clean up.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960423.227</strong><br />
<em>Day 3</em><br />
This can be easily defined as perhaps one of the most beautiful days in my life.We didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to go up Pikes Peak, the result of finally figuring out what the hell we were doing. We went to the Cave of the Winds, an uphill drive (and downhill) I&#8217;ll not soon forget.<br />
We spent almost as much time on the road as in Kansas, but the sights were much better.<br />
Finally arriving in Cortez, we scarfed down peanut butter sandwiches for &#8220;dinner&#8221; and everyone (sans moi) is getting drunk on cheap wine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was the alcoholic content of the wine, the change in altitude, or the phase of the moon but Rebecca got loony very quickly. By loony, I mean more or less drunk. Being the Observer, I know what drunk people are like &#8230; I&#8217;ve known hundreds, and this year became one of them. So I know drunk. Rebecca was not &#8220;hammered&#8221; or &#8220;blitzed&#8221;, but she was, to take a line from Pink Floyd, comfortably numb.<br />
The wine didn&#8217;t seem to affect Stefan or Dhar much, except the slight redness in Dhar&#8217;s nose, so we concentrated on Rebecca&#8217;s antics. When that got boring (right about when the bottle was emptied), we began talking about whatever came to mind.<br />
Take a set of young adults, give them alcohol, put them in a confined space and 99 times out of 100, they&#8217;ll end up on sex. Not necessarily participate in the act of sex (although that is a possibility), but discussion almost invariably leads to sex. I really have to wonder why psychologists have never studied this. Is it a preoccupation? I know it is with men (being one, I feel I can speak confidently for the whole), but is it with women? I can&#8217;t say Rebecca speaks for the whole of women, since she&#8217;s preoccupied with it for different reasons &#8212; she already has had kids, and is a sex expert in her line of employment.<br />
Nevertheless, we ended up talking about sex. Specifics I cannot recall, since I was not only fairly tired, but the number of such discussions I have had prior and since that night have irreversibly garbled what memory of particulars I had of that evening.<br />
What I do remember of that evening was Dhar&#8217;s silence. Rebecca did most of the talking, Stefan and I accounting for about only half the discussion. It was then that I realized that Dhar was insecure about the subject. At first I thought he was just a kindred spirit to myself &#8212; too shy to ask, too desperate to get it. But his general lack of contribution, even when prompted, told a totally different story. Sex was not quite taboo, but it was something very private to him and not open for discussion at any time. I sympathized with him, having to listen to the three of us babble away while he patiently sat there and waited for us to finish.<br />
Somewhere close to 01:00, we decided that sleep was not a bad idea. The plans for the following day were to visit the Four Corners and the Grand Canyon, getting into Las Vegas sometime around 20:00 that night.<br />
I pulled my bed out as usual, but Dhar decided that he was going to try a different way of sleeping, and simply tilted his chair back. Dhar spent the night sleeping in a reclined seated position, facing the rear of the van. It didn&#8217;t stop him snoring through, he began than less than five minutes after the lights went out&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The rain came down so heavily I have yet to see an adjective to properly describe it &#8212; &#8220;sheets&#8221; is not hard enough, and &#8220;Niagara Falls&#8221; is far too much. Somewhere in between will have to suffice until a proper word can be agreed upon. Needless to say though, Rebecca was none too thrilled with having to drive through it.<br />
I personally believe that any person, regardless of sex or race, is capable of anything when dead set on doing something &#8230; except for a few cases. This happened to be one of them. Rebecca was visibly nervous about driving the van, even more so when visibility dropped to less than 100 feet. I know that when I get stuck with something potentially dangerous, and someone more capable than I is nearby, I ask for help. I also know that it&#8217;s the strong people who seldom ask for help. Intelligence be damned &#8212; pride is a hard thing to overcome. (I&#8217;ll dispense with the Pulp Fiction quotes.)<br />
Rebecca pulled off I-70 and into a closed gas station, amidst a flurry of road reconstruction. (The construction theme was one we would see many times throughout our trip, this was the first major encounter for us.) Unlike others that would follow, this didn&#8217;t greatly affect our travel.<br />
Under the canopy of the gas bar, Rebecca relinquished her seat to Dhar. He promptly set about getting the mirrors exactly where he wanted them. This gave us all a chance to get up for a moment and stretch out before getting back onto the Interstate. A moment later, Dhar pulled out from under the canopy, drove out into the chewed-up road, up the on-ramp and back onto the highway. And into a storm the likes of which I had never seen before.<br />
The rain we encountered briefly with Rebecca had been hard and steady &#8230; but short. Almost as soon as we had pulled off the highway, the rain had slowed to a trickle. None of us chose to see this as a sign, or at least if anyone did they kept quiet. When Dhar took over driving, we entered a four hour maelstrom of water, lightning, and wind.<br />
(Author&#8217;s note: About a week after we returned home, the mid-west, including a good portion of the states we drove through, experienced serious flooding as a result of heavier-than-usual rainfall.)<br />
Less than a half hour after leaving the gas station, the wind began to pick up again. This disappointed us because we firmly believed that the head-wind we had coming from Oakville had given us our less-than-excellent gas mileage. It also made driving more difficult. But the wind wasn&#8217;t the result of the heating of the Earth&#8217;s surface, as had the wind some twelve hours earlier &#8212; this wind was the result of a cold front. A cold front that brought us the worst storm I have ever seen.<br />
The rain started coming down shortly after the wind started. Every ten minutes the rain&#8217;s volume doubled, likening the downpour more to Niagara Falls than a sheet. Even with the windshield wipers on full we could hardly see. For a short period, Dhar reduced speed to keep us from hitting something or sliding off the road.<br />
Flashes in the distance continued to come closer and closer, until we were surrounded by lightening. The sight was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I have loved lightning storms for many years now (despite that when I was a kid, I was scared to death of them), and although we saw only a few truly spectacular bolts, those that we did see ranked among the most spectacular of my life. Not long after we entered the lightning portion of the storm, Stefan decided to make me feel like a little kid again.<br />
&#8220;Is this van shielded?&#8221; he asked. Being a non-engineer, and being rather uneducated in vehicular safety outside of seat belts, airbags, anti-lock brakes, and drink holders big enough to hold a jumbo Slurpee(r), I had no idea what Stefan was referring to. He explained that most cars (and by most, I am referring to any car you can buy from a dealer) are electrically shielded. If struck by lightning on the roof, the charge is carried down the walls and out through the bottom simply by the way the car is constructed.<br />
As Stefan was quick to point out, the roof of the van wasn&#8217;t metal &#8212; it was fibreglass and plastic. The last time I checked, the only thing you could conduct with fibreglass or plastic was an orchestra. I knew there was a wrap-around antenna for the television, but I didn&#8217;t know if Home &amp; Park had installed a grounding strip to draw any outside electrical current into the metal body of the van. I had a vision of a bolt suddenly bursting through the ceiling and vapourizing us where we sat. I tried to think of any recorded lightning strikes on a moving motorhome &#8230; and drew a blank. Nevertheless, I quickly found myself wondering when we would be exiting the storm.<br />
Stefan, now having successfully frightened me into staying awake watching for lightning strikes, wandered to the rear bed where Rebecca was already asleep. Rebecca got more sleep during the trip than Stefan, Dhar and I combined. I&#8217;m not complaining, I think she deserved it &#8212; mothers with small children get so little sleep. I know my parents took every opportunity to get away from my sister and I to relax, so I could hold nothing against Stefan and Rebecca.<br />
Dhar continued to drive through the night, wrestling the wind and the rain. The two of us talked, played music, and stared out into the lonely stormy night. Every so often we were passed by a semi-trailer driving about ten miles an hour faster than us, which naturally made Dhar and I a little leery of sliding off the road into a fiery death. Appealing as it may be to some, we had intentions of making it at least as far as Vegas before committing ritual suicide<br />
Over the course of several hours, the storm lessened in strength until at last all that was left was an overcast sky. At around 05:30, we entered Kansas City Limits. I should also point out at this time that we had already crossed into the Central Time Zone, and our clock was dutifully adjusted whenever we crossed any time zone.<br />
The amount of traffic in Kansas City was negligible, rush hour wasn&#8217;t for at least another hour. And this time we would hit rush hour &#8212; it was now Monday morning. Soon we were skirting in and around the overpasses and underpasses that made up the downtown core of Kansas City. Several times the wind blew us around, and scared the hell out of Dhar because he wasn&#8217;t ready. In a little more than a half hour, the city limits were again approaching, as was a minor change in our roadway status.<br />
We entered onto the Kansas Turnpike. Unfortunately for us, this was a toll road. Doubly unfortunate, there was no way to avoid it (if we had tried to stay on I-70, we would&#8217;ve ended up in Wichita). For me, this was the first time I had ever been on a toll road where you paid to get off, not on. At the first booth, we took a ticket from the gate attendant, and proceeded on our way. Almost immediately, Dhar noted that we couldn&#8217;t exceed the speed limit here, since the attendant at the other end would know if we tried to go too fast by the amount of time it took us to get there.<br />
By this time the sun had begun to rise, and the two in the back slowly began to wake up. Stefan had mentioned shortly before joining Rebecca that he wanted to see the sun rise that morning, and left orders with us to wake him at that time. As it turned out, he awoke before the sun could really be seen (the clouds remained for quite some time that morning, and didn&#8217;t burn off until after noon.)<br />
Stefan, becoming more aware of where he was, suddenly realized that he&#8217;d been there before several years previous. He remembered rest stops in the middle of the Turnpike. As he explained it, somewhere along the turnpike was a restaurant and a gas station &#8230; in the middle of the road. Odd, perhaps, but it didn&#8217;t change the fact that while Stefan remembered that they existed, he couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where.<br />
As the ambient daylight increased, our fuel supply decreased, both automobile and human alike. Then the blue and white sign appeared before us: Rest Stop, 1 Mile. Another sign soon indicated that we would exit not on the right side of the road, but the left. Stefan&#8217;s memory seemed quite accurate, if incomplete.<br />
Once again I will state for the record that while Americans can build the best highways in the world, they have no concept of merging. Putting on-ramps and off-ramps along the faster lanes is just poor planning, regardless of efficiency. Unless you happen to drive a vehicle with a turbo-charged V12, or happen to have solid-rocket boosters strapped to the side of your minivan, you&#8217;re potential roadkill. The length of American on-ramps and off-ramps is also horrible, quite often being less than 20 feet. I know of few vehicles that can accelerate to 60 miles per hour in less than 20 feet. The Behemoth isn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
We pulled off the road shortly after 06:30, and pulled up to a Hardee&#8217;s, the American equivalent to Harvey&#8217;s. We were hungry, but the foremost thing on my mind was using the toilet. I opened my door, and my skin immediately started crawling, desperately trying to get away from the cold. We had started our travel south, but the warm weather we so desperately wanted was not yet to be felt. I quickly jogged around the side of the beige brick building, and found the entrance.<br />
I quickly realized that this was a truck stop. I define a truck stop as any restaurant that wouldn&#8217;t accommodate most families. This one wouldn&#8217;t accommodate most families of roaches, let alone me. I quickly entered the Men&#8217;s Room and even more swiftly, emptied my bladder into the first available urinal. Several large, mostly overweight men were milling about, in various states of relieving themselves. I opted not to start a conversation.<br />
A moment later, I was back at the van, warning the rest not to eat there, adding that the restrooms should be considered &#8220;last resorts&#8221;. I expected more opposition, but I guess there&#8217;s always a good solid line between food and sanitation. Hey, we might have been university students, but even we had our limits.<br />
But the gas was cheap, so we took the opportunity to fill our tank. The wind was chilly, maybe 10 degrees Celsius, my hands nearly froze to the pump handle. Wearing shorts probably didn&#8217;t help matters much.<br />
I took over driving again, feeling fairly awake considering my lack of sleep. I assumed that my excitement to be someplace new was enough to keep me going. (That, and the rude awakening from running around in the cold while wearing shorts.) I honestly wondered how long I could keep it up. Pulling out into the turnpike turned out not to be too severe a problem &#8212; there was no-one else driving that early on a Monday morning.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we found ourselves at the end of our jaunt along the Kansas Turnpike, as it began to arc towards Wichita, which was away from our planned route (kind of like Syndey, Australia is out of the way of Paris, France). We paid our $1.75 toll and returned to the I-70. We drove for only a couple hours before hunger got the better of Dhar, Rebecca, and myself. Despite his proclaimed starvation at the Hardee&#8217;s earlier, sleep overcame the walking stomach (Stefan), and he crawled back into bed. The rest of us kept watch for a restaurant.<br />
Finding restaurants along Interstates turned out to be a relatively easy prospect. Whenever an exit sign appeared, it was usually followed by three more signs. Each of these signs indicated which gas stations, hotels, and restaurants were available at each exit. This, for us, was a big benefit because it kept us from having to get off the Interstate and wander around needlessly wasting gas. So whenever we got mildly esurient, we kept watch for restaurant signs and bickered about which places we weren&#8217;t going.<br />
With Stefan mostly asleep, we took the first exit the three of us agreed on &#8212; Perkins. It wasn&#8217;t Rebecca&#8217;s first choice for fine eating &#8212; nor anyone else with a heartbeat &#8212; several times she had mentioned that Perkins was prone to bad food and horrible service. This was her experience. I, on the other hand, had never been to a Perkins before and had no qualms about giving it a try.<br />
Rebecca, Dhar, and I got ready to go for breakfast while Stefan steadfastly stuck to staying in bed. It was ironic that the human garborator, who only an hour or two earlier had professed his undying need for nourishment, was in fact &#8220;too tired&#8221; to eat. Having formerly held a similar title in eating, I knew that there was no such thing as &#8220;too tired&#8221;. But I wasn&#8217;t about to try and move him. I figured we&#8217;d just leave him to his stomach.<br />
The Perkins was nearly empty. This I found somewhat surprising considering that it was now past seven o&#8217;clock and most people would be ready to eat. Then again, it was a Monday morning in a small town whose only link to the outside world seemed to be through the Interstate. What appeared to be the main road ran under the Interstate, and every building of significance seemed to be within a mile of the Interstate, including the Perkins.<br />
The waitress appeared almost as soon as we had sat down. We ordered up two coffees and one orange juice (I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, drink coffee &#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;d be like wired on that much caffeine). Rebecca chided me for not having coffee, proclaiming that I should &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; and be a little more adventurous (I got that a lot during the trip &#8212; I&#8217;m a conservative in rebel clothing). I didn&#8217;t want to get addicted to coffee, I have found dependence to something during long journeys can be distracting. As it stands, I actually considered having coffee after a taste of my orange juice &#8230; rather, my glass of Tang.<br />
Almost as soon as the waitress disappeared with our drink order, Stefan stumbled in through the entrance. We knew that he&#8217;d be along sooner or later, you simply can&#8217;t sleep when your stomach wants to be satisfied. He sat down across from Rebecca and announced wearily that he was hungry. We restrained the urge to snicker. When the waitress returned a moment later with our beverages, she was visibly confused, wondering if she had accidentally missed a person the first time. Stefan smiled sheepishly and ordered a coffee.<br />
As for the food, I chose a decidedly large breakfast of a three-egg omelette, pancakes, hash browns, and sausages. By the time I finished eating, I was quite satisfied. I felt ready to tackle another large chunk of America. Stefan&#8217;s and Dhar&#8217;s means were variants on each other, and of equivalent size to mine. Only Rebecca ate less &#8230; and even then, not by much. Stefan woke up the more he ate, by the end of breakfast he looked completely alert. However, that might have been due to the coffee&#8230;<br />
Stefan picked up the tab for breakfast that morning, but we added it to the log of expenses so we could figure out how much we owed him at a later date. This was a pattern that would continue for the rest of the trip. It make figuring out bills a lot easier.<br />
Outside the wind was still blowing hard and cold, I made a quick return to the van to get it started. Rebecca made mention of stopping somewhere for food and drinks, but I was more intent on getting back on the road. I figured that we&#8217;d find what we wanted at the next gas stop.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960422.075</strong><br />
<em>Day 2</em><br />
Despite a storm of biblical proportions, we&#8217;ve made it into Kansas. I&#8217;m surviving on about 2 hours sleep &#8230; does it ever hurt.We&#8217;ve run into our first major argument &#8211; namely where the hell this damn trip is going. I personally want to hit all the places in our itinerary, but Stefan seems to want to keep us in the Colorado Springs area. I was planning only on about 2 days, but now that&#8217;s up to 4 &#8230; we&#8217;ll figure this out somewhere.<br />
Becka survived her initial stint of about 10 miles at the helm, but she caught the very front of that storm, and we moved Dhar in instead. 9 hours to our last stop.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus we truly began our nine hour odyssey across Kansas. Of all the states we visited, Kansas would be the last state I would ever settle in. It&#8217;s too flat. The Interstates go on for hundreds of miles in straight lines. There&#8217;s nothing to see for hours on end. The distance markers never seem to change. (If you haven&#8217;t already gotten the picture, it&#8217;s unbelievably boring.)<br />
Somewhere in the galactic schemes of things, Kansas has become the place where time and space have no meaning. You can exist there for hours and get nowhere. True believers think that all the strangeness exists in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. No-one has even considered Kansas. No-one knows that its original settlers still live there, not having ever grown old. It&#8217;s a little known fact, and Kansasites want to keep it that way &#8212; waiting for the day their people come from Borotron to capture the Earth. Mark my words: when aliens take over the Earth, their capital will be in Kansas!<br />
Boredom, thy name is Kansas. I was so strung out from crossing the Sunflower State, when I saw a bumpiness just on the horizon, I swore they were mountains. Everyone else was telling me they were just clouds, but I didn&#8217;t want to believe it. By this time Stefan had assumed the driver&#8217;s position, and I became obsessed with leaving the wide open spaces for something a little more feature-ridden. To my despair, the bumpiness turned out to be only clouds forming into strange shapes, that I wrongly assumed could have only been formed near large formations in the Earth. I never did find out how those clouds formed, but we didn&#8217;t see any real mountains until a few hours later.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Kansas wasn&#8217;t the first mostly flat place I&#8217;d been. My mother was born in Saskatchewan, which is almost in the middle of the great Canadian plains. The plains I knew best were the ones from Saskatoon to Prince Albert, a distance of about 200 kilometres. There the land is reasonably flat, but with a fair number of rolling hills and the odd valley or two. My mother testifies that the southern portion of Saskatchewan, out by Regina, is flatter than the proverbial pancake. Having never been further south than Saskatoon, I didn&#8217;t know. Kansas is awfully like the southern portion of Saskatchewan, only flatter.<br />
It was while we drove endlessly through Kansas that I first heard of &#8220;highway hypnosis&#8221;. I learned that during long trips, especially in places with nothing to look at except straight lines with few curves (I won&#8217;t mention any six-letter mid-American agricultural states), you tend to start not noticing things. At first you miss the odd road sign. Then it&#8217;s how fast you&#8217;re going. Pretty soon you don&#8217;t notice the semi-trailers carrying large red farm equipment heading directly for you because you drifted over into a lane you didn&#8217;t know existed. None of us seemed to succumb to the potentially fatal problem, but then again we tended to talk too much while we were driving.<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, our first sign of progress appeared: the Kansas / Colorado border. We felt like celebrating, like we had accomplished some great feat of endurance that no human had ever before had done. But even from that point, we still had another hour and a half before we would leave the I-70 and take State Highway 24 to Colorado Springs. So we settled for a rousing rendition of: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re in Kansas anymore!&#8221;<br />
As we rounded a large rain storm just to the south of us, I caught a glimpse of my first mountain. Until then the largest mountain I had ever seen were in the Laurentian Mountains in Quebec, part of the Appalachian Mountains. Much older than the Rocky Mountains, the Laurentians are also much shorter. Stefan was quick to note that although spectacular, even the mountains in the Colorado section of the Rocky Mountains were small when compared to the ones in British Columbia and Alberta.<br />
Before we knew it the land was bubbling with mountains, most of them capped with high snowy peaks. Some a leftover of a strong winter, the rest due to their height. Never before had I imagined such a sight. Sure, I had read literally hundreds of books and articles on mountains and mountain ranges, and seen countless feet of footage in movies and documentaries, but nothing in the world could have prepared me for the sight I beheld.<br />
And nothing could have prepared us for what still lay on the ground. Snow. Winter in most of Canada that year had been particularly long and harsh. Part of the trip, for me at least, was to escape the winter for at least two weeks. The snow had melted in Canada some two to three weeks earlier. But in Colorado, patches of snow still clung to the ground like a frightened child to its mother. I suddenly felt a little depressed. Long winters tend to do that to a person.<br />
The van was beginning to act rather strangely, even for a vehicle that hadn&#8217;t been fully broken in yet. I assumed the problems stemmed from our altitude. Just from entering Colorado alone, we had climbed to an altitude of some 4,000 feet above sea level. Oakville, by comparison, is only about 300 to 400 feet above sea level. The higher we climbed, the less air there was for the van to use. Even I started feeling a little light-headed after a while.<br />
When we reached the junction of the I-70 and Highway 24, we quickly found ourselves traveling through the quaint little town of Limon, elevation 5,360 feet. I wondered how strange we looked to the locals, seeing a large white van-cum-motorhome speeding through small 4&#215;4&#8217;s, pickups and cars. The roads weren&#8217;t as nice as the Interstate, but as Stefan had been waiting to see, the roads were pink.<br />
Yes, pink.<br />
In most places around America, the roads are made with black sand. Don&#8217;t ask me why, this is just the way of things. But believe it or not, black sand is expensive, at least to carry to places like Colorado. There they made use of local materials instead. And in Colorado, not to forget Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, some of the readily available materials, namely the sand, is red. The result is pink roads.<br />
And you thought Highway Hypnosis on black roads was troublesome.<br />
The question of residence was raised not long after we entered Colorado. We still hadn&#8217;t decided where we were going to be spending the night. A partial decision had been made some time earlier that we stay at a campsite, but which one was still up in the air. Thus we dove into the RV Campsite book that my father had received from the Mobilife, who had sold us the Behemoth.<br />
The Campsite book is concise and complete, listing every single campsite across North America. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s also several inches thick. After several debates on the services we wanted to have available, we decided on the Garden of the Gods campground, which was on the opposite side of Colorado Springs to the side we were entering. I wasn&#8217;t too thrilled with having to cross an unknown city, but for a pool and hot-tub, it seemed like a good idea. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Colorado Springs city limits came into view.<br />
Under most situations, the navigator doesn&#8217;t do very much. When passing through a city, the navigator makes sure the driver doesn&#8217;t accidentally take an off-ramp into the downtown core, or get onto a different highway that takes us to Timbuktu. And that&#8217;s in the worst of conditions, they last usually no more than a half hour. (At night, the navigator is also helpful at keeping the driver awake.) When we actually get off into a city, that&#8217;s a whole other issue.<br />
I was pulling navigator duty when we arrived in Colorado Springs, somewhere around 17:30 in the afternoon. Unfortunately, this meant rush hour. So far, we had managed to avoid any major form of vehicular traffic, something we liked. It kept our travel time lower, not to mention our stress levels. But it had become time to face the music and get stuck in the thick of things.<br />
We got off Highway 24 onto Power Boulevard and headed south to Fountain Street. The idea was to get us to the other side of the city as easily as possible so we could find Colorado Avenue. This, according to the Campsite book, was where we would find the Garden of the Gods campground. What the Campsite book didn&#8217;t tell us was how hard it would be to get across the city with our asses still attached to our rear ends.<br />
We barely missed going the wrong way at an intersection and almost landed on I-25. As it turns out, that in itself wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad, but I would&#8217;ve had to figure out which exit to then get off. (No, I&#8217;m not that bad a navigator, but it was first proverbial kick at the cat, so I wasn&#8217;t entirely confident in my abilities at that point.) Eventually we made it over to Cascade Avenue, which we would then take up to Colorado.<br />
We noticed something about Colorado Springs almost immediately &#8212; it was clean. Not just a general lack of garbage in the streets, but an overall appearance of cleanliness. There was no dirt on the roads, the grass was cut, there seemed to be no pollution &#8230; even the trees seemed to be polished. It was like driving through a Disney-created city. Disturbing is too soft a term to describe what I felt, and frightened is too harsh.<br />
Many Americans, when they come to Canada, marvel at how clean our cities are. After many years, many Canadians would probably beg to differ with those Americans. Many of these Canadians, however, haven&#8217;t been to the United States. For a Canadian, then, to call an American city &#8220;clean&#8221; is nothing short of high praise. Colorado Springs was nearly spotless. To this date, I still proclaim that there are two cities in the United States I would move to. My first choice is Colorado Springs. (My second choice is New Orleans, which has got to be Colorado Springs&#8217; antithesis. Go figure that one, eh?)<br />
We debated on the reason for the cleanliness. One of our conclusions was that Colorado Springs is a military city, containing both Fort Carson and the Peterson Air Force Base. All the military spending might spill into the city, either allowing or forcing the city to keep itself clean. Another reason that we either initially ignored or forgot was that Colorado Springs is also a large tourist attraction in that part of Colorado. The tourist dollars (a few of which we contributed) simply allow a solid cleanup effort.<br />
But even clean cities still have rush hour traffic. (Though I&#8217;d forgotten about that?) I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it then, and I&#8217;m still not sure what to make of it now. The veteran of some of the worst traffic jams Toronto has to offer, I&#8217;ve seen (and experienced) some of the worst rush hours in North America. Colorado Springs, population 247,700, is the only major point of population in its area &#8212; rush hour probably only lasts an hour, if that. This I determined from sitting at the corner of Cascade and Colorado.<br />
It looked like the intersection of any non-descript small city. No buildings nearby over three stories, lots of trees, lampposts that were at least 15 years old (not that it&#8217;s a bad thing, they added a lot of character), meridians down the middle complete with trees and grass &#8230; it was very picturesque. It was also full of cars.<br />
We were in the left turning lane, the sole vehicle trying to turn from Cascade onto Colorado. We waited patiently for all the traffic in the on-coming lane to disperse so we could continue on our way. But one of the vehicles in the on-coming lane was a semi-trailer with a flatbed. He was way too close to the edge of the road. And apparently not too experienced with going around corners.<br />
Trucks like that normally take very wide right hand turns, mostly to compensate for the length and inflexibility of the trailers. Remember I said &#8220;normally&#8221;. This guy either got stuck in the rightmost lane, or was a beginner and no idea what he was doing. He started turning left and quickly found that he was going to take out the traffic light control box if he continued forward. He was blocking our exit, and the lights were about to change. Rebecca, Dhar, and I quickly urged Stefan to back up before we started blocking traffic. The urge was particularly strong because we hadn&#8217;t anyone else behind us at the time, and I didn&#8217;t know how long that would last.<br />
We had backed up just as the lights changed. The truck however, was still stuck in the intersection, waiting for the traffic to disperse in the lanes in front of him so he could pull forward more before turning. This caused the traffic wanting to cross the intersection to have to wait until the truck was gone before they could go. I began to wonder how many lights we were going to have to sit through to see this problem resolved. By the end of the light cycle, the truck was driving off, and the cars on Colorado were crossing Cascade. But with no advanced green or an arrow to let us go, we had to wait for traffic on Cascade to filter out.<br />
But soon we were on Colorado heading east, towards what we hoped would be our campground. It was then I found out an interesting thing about Colorado &#8212; the roads like to move around. It turned out that somewhere along the line, Colorado shifted to the next road north. We were back on Highway 24. And surrounded by morons, like the woman in a teeny tiny little car who decided she would pass us on our right as Stefan began to make a lane change. She even had the gall to honk at us like it was our fault. Some drivers should just be run off the road and be taken out of everyone&#8217;s misery. But I will say one thing about American drivers: on a whole, they have far more common sense than most of the drivers in Southern Ontario.<br />
We passed under the overpass for the I-25 and quickly came to another lighted intersection, just changing red in our direction. Dhar immediately noticed a series of cooling towers to our left. Our initial impulse was a nuclear power station, prompting Dhar to sing (to the tune of The Flintstones theme): &#8220;Simpson &#8230; Homer Simpson &#8230; he&#8217;s the greatest man in history! From the &#8230; town of Springfield &#8230; he&#8217;s about to hit a chestnut tree!&#8221; Like I already said, Dhar and I drove Rebecca crazy with our Simpson&#8217;s references.<br />
I dismissed the notion of a nuclear power plant being so deep inside a city, and so far away from a major source of water. I guessed it was a power plant fired by natural resources (like coal), or even perhaps a geothermal station (about which I was somewhat doubtful, as I didn&#8217;t know of any geothermal activity in that area). Either way, we didn&#8217;t get too long a look as the light soon changed and we drove on through.<br />
In Colorado Springs, there is at least one intelligent city road planner. This was the person who saw it necessary to install small junctions from Highway 24 across a small valley to Colorado Avenue. A good thing, otherwise we&#8217;d have driven into the mountains, which was where we didn&#8217;t want to go. This got us closer to where we wanted to be, but even then we weren&#8217;t certain. Tensions grew and tempers shortened as each person tried to give directions to the campground we couldn&#8217;t find.<br />
One thing I should also note about navigators &#8212; only one navigator should be allowed to navigate, otherwise confusion seems to reign supreme. The Campsite book was in the possession of Dhar and Rebecca, neither of whom were the current navigator, both of whom read out differing accounts of the same directions to take us to Garden of the Gods, and both became more irritated when Stefan was unable to comply with their instructions. Stefan, in a vain attempt to figure out what both of them were trying to say, drove up Colorado until we entered Manitou, a suburb of Colorado Springs. At this point, we all agreed that we&#8217;d gone too far.<br />
Frustrated, we turned around and came back, still not sure of where we were going. Stefan decided to take things into his own hands and darted up Garden of the Gods Road, thinking that maybe the campground might be located on that street. At the time, the idea couldn&#8217;t have hurt &#8212; eight eyes all missed the entrance twice.<br />
But up Garden of the Gods Road, we found the road&#8217;s namesake &#8212; Garden of the Gods Park. I had briefly read something about the park in the AAA TourBook (r) for Colorado / Utah, and it seemed like an interesting place to visit. I hadn&#8217;t expected to see it on our arrival, but the break was more than welcome &#8230; especially since we were probably only minutes from starting to scream and yell at each other.<br />
Stefan drove up the winding road, walls of trees and rock sprouted on either side of a the road for a moment, then gave way to a large reddish ochre rock wall as the road turned. In the wall was a large V-shaped crack running vertically, and at the top of the crack was a large boulder of the same colour as the wall upon which it sat. That alone wasn&#8217;t as impressive as what lay around another turn.<br />
Immediately I understood the reason why someone had named the park &#8220;Garden of the Gods&#8221;. The portion we could see was a shallow bowl-shaped valley, surrounded by large mountains of the same reddish-ochre rock. The mountains were inconsequential when compared to the neighbouring Rockies, but the Rockies lacked the bold colour.<br />
The rocks were likely a sandstone, formed many millions of years ago when the Colorado Springs area sat under 50 feet of ocean. Over the years, the water level dropped and the land level rose, exposing the layer of stone to the elements. The wind and the rain carved the rock into a softly flowing, sweeping landscape. The valley that was left eventually filled with deep green foliage in the forms of shrubs and small trees. It could have been the playground for Zeus&#8217; children, for Venus&#8217; lovers, for Diana&#8217;s prey. It was now the plaything of the more outgoing members of the human race.<br />
Stefan pulled to the side of the road, mostly on our urging, Dhar and I immediately sprinted outside and started to take pictures. I took both my large 35 mm camera, and a small disposable Kodak panoramic camera I had bought just before we left. Alas, the pictures I took just didn&#8217;t bring out the vibrant hues that seemed to spill from every point in my view (even though I was using Kodak film, which tends more towards reds and oranges.)<br />
Dhar took a few pictures as did Stefan or Rebecca, depending on which one was using the camera at the time. We spend only a few minutes basking in the splendour before climbing back in the van, and proceeding down the road to try and find the campground.<br />
We drove slowly, partly so we could see all the scenery, partly because there were many pedestrians, bicyclists, and much smaller vehicles driving about, and Stefan probably wasn&#8217;t in the mood to crush anyone at the time. After rounding several corners, we stumbled across the General Store and Gift Shop, which seemed like an interesting place to stop temporarily and get directions to figure out where we were going. I also wanted to get more film.<br />
The store looked like a reconstruction of a stereotypical store one would expect in a stereotypical Western movie, with the exception of the stereotypical town drunk, and that the store was only a single-level establishment. Out front was a robotic cowboy, complete with poorly moving jaw and a computer-synthesized voice straight out of the Commodore 64 version of Impossible Mission by Epyx. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh not only at the antiquated technology as I walked by, but also at the other tourists who were taking pictures of it.<br />
This was one of few trips I have ever been on, in fact it may be the only trip, that I completely acknowledged the fact that I was a tourist. Many times I have gone out of my way to blend in, as not to look &#8220;dorky&#8221; or end up &#8220;sticking out like a sore thumb&#8221;. This usually occurs when I walk around with my camera slung around my neck. But this trip was different &#8212; I felt like acting like a tourist. Why? Just in case I was asked where I was from. That way I could tell people how much snow there was in Canada, that I have to take a dog sled team to work everyday, and that during certain times of the year we pay for things with ice because it&#8217;s too cold to carry money with you.<br />
And so we entered our first tourist trap of the trip. Inside was every single tacky souvenir you could possibly image &#8230; and a few you couldn&#8217;t. We spent a few minutes wandering around, seeing what annoying little gifts we would have to avoid buying over the next few days we were in Colorado. I bought another roll of film, and Stefan obtained directions to the campground.<br />
Unluckily for us, the directions we received were even more cryptic than the ones we had tried to follow about a half hour earlier. But part of the instructions we understood &#8212; go to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. This sounded at least partially feasible. So we all climbed back in the van again, and continued to follow the one-way road out towards what I believe to be 30th Street, which had the east entrance to the park. Just across the road was the Visitor&#8217;s Center.<br />
After a quick bought of indecision by yours truly on which entrance to use (there were two), Stefan drove south about 100 feet and turned into the driveway. He continued through the almost completely empty parking lot, and pulled up front the sliding glass doors. Two people walked in front of us as we pulled up, a man and a cigarette-smoking woman. Both of us seemed to cast a stare that said: &#8220;What the hell are you doing here?&#8221;<br />
The glance was in a way justified, the Center had closed, though when it had closed was indeterminable without getting out of the van, which none of us were really too keep about. We sighed, Stefan backed up and turned around, and then headed down 30th Street towards Colorado Avenue again.<br />
Part way down, he turned at a side street and headed west to another side road. Stefan barely slowed at the stop sign and turned south again. This road was interesting, as it was divided by a creek running down the centre of the road. The road was divided by about 20 to 30 feet, where it formed a concrete and stone &#8216;V&#8217;. Every so often, a small concrete bridge linked one side of the road with the other. The creek emptied into the valley that separated Highway 24 and Colorado Avenue.<br />
When we reached Colorado Avenue again, Stefan turned right and headed west one more time. Almost immediately the confusion we had tried to lose in the Garden of the Gods caught up, and we started arguing again. At a slight bend in the road a small road jutted to one side, which for us was going perfectly straight. I suggested to Stefan that he pull onto it for a moment until we figure out where we were. It didn&#8217;t seem to help much. But just as we were about to turn back to Colorado, a well-hidden sign right in front of us read: Garden of the Gods Campground. We let out a quiet cheer as Stefan pulled into the lot.<br />
The only campgrounds I had ever been to before were for tents. I hadn&#8217;t seen an RV park before, and wasn&#8217;t immediately impressed with Garden of the Gods. In hindsight, it was actually quite a nice looking place. Except for one small detail &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t quite open yet. As it turned out, we were the pre-season tourists.<br />
The main office was closed, but we were met by whom I assumed to be the caretaker. He explained the water and electrical hook-ups were available, but none of the facilities were really open yet, and only the toilets were usable &#8212; the showers wouldn&#8217;t be ready for a couple weeks. I was past the point of giving a shit, and was interested in getting hooked up for the night, eating, and getting some sleep. Both Stefan and Rebecca wanted a hot tub to relax in for a while.<br />
The caretaker suggested that we check out another campground just down the road which was listed as a &#8220;Good Sam Park&#8221; (whatever that&#8217;s supposed to mean). So we thanked the caretaker, suggested that we might be back (which I took to mean that only if the world came to an end and we felt the need to end our lives in a rush), climbed back into the van and left the campground.<br />
The Good Sam park wasn&#8217;t any better. It was much smaller, and it&#8217;s facilities weren&#8217;t open either &#8230; what few it had. We didn&#8217;t have to get out of the van before we decided that we weren&#8217;t staying there either. Stefan drove across a small bridge from Colorado Avenue, stopped briefly in front of the main office, drove around back, round to the front, across the bridge and back onto Colorado.<br />
Dhar started whining. He wanted a hotel room. Dhar was housebroken &#8212; he had never been camping before, in any form. An RV is a luxury for a camper, and for Dhar this was roughing it. Before the trip, he hadn&#8217;t had Kraft Dinner (or facsimiles), or anything else that seemed to go hand-in-hand with camping. I was surprised that he even had a sleeping bag.<br />
Everywhere along Colorado were hotels and motels advertising rooms for $30 or less. Stefan, Rebecca, and I flatly refused to give in so easily, opting to try and find the KOA that Stefan knew was in the area and settle in for the night. The only problem we seemed to have was finding the KOA. None of the maps we had seemed to indicate the exit we had to take to find the KOA, and while the instructions in the RV Campsite book were fairly good, Stefan&#8217;s last memory of trying to find the campsite was rough.<br />
Apparently, when Stefan had been in Colorado Springs the first time, he had stayed at the Kampgrounds Of America (KOA) in the south side of the city. But as he had tried to find it, the driver took a wrong turn, and landed in Fort Carson&#8217;s Tank Proving Grounds. Normally, you can&#8217;t miss this area, as the roads are lined with tank crossing signs.<br />
The first idea was to find the AAA office. Stefan knew that there we could get a KOA book, which would have much better directions to our destination. I guided Stefan onto the I-25 south, which would take us back to Highway 24 east. That in turn to Academy Boulevard, somewhere on which was supposed to be the AAA office.<br />
The route back to Academy Rd. was a little on the nerve-wracking side, having more cut-offs and merging streets than we could really handle after driving so long without a break, and arguing over where we were going. This culminated with me jumping the gun and leading Stefan up the wrong road. We still got to Academy, but we lost the advantage of a light to turn easily onto Academy. But Stefan was undaunted, and executed a perfect left turn, crossing two lanes of traffic and merging with a large flow of cars from the south.<br />
For five minutes we traveled north until we were where one of the maps said the AAA should be. However the map we were using was incorrect. The office was in reality in the north end of the city. This didn&#8217;t stop us from going through several of the strip malls, searching for the illusive AAA sign. After keeping this up for about ten minutes, and several &#8220;let&#8217;s try the next mall, just in case&#8221;, we gave up. Academy Road, alas, wasn&#8217;t there any longer &#8212; the road had split into one-way roads, with another strip mall in the middle.<br />
Stefan continued to mutter under his breath as he negotiated his way into the southbound lanes. While Stefan muttered, I looked through several maps and tried to piece together enough information to figure out where we were going. It took a few minutes, but I eventually determined where we needed to be. No-one said a word of hope or encouragement, partially due to lack of energy, partially in case I was wrong.<br />
As per my instructions, Stefan headed south towards I-25. Rebecca and Dhar pointed out all the liquor stores that seemed to line Academy. This started a long running joke about liquor: &#8220;But you don&#8217;t even know her!&#8221; (Liquor &#8230; &#8220;Lick Her&#8221; &#8230; get it?) When I first heard this, I had to think about it a minute. I was tempted to respond with such answers as: &#8220;Nothing wrong with strange bedfellows&#8221;, or &#8220;How you know she won&#8217;t like it?&#8221; But what little decency I had at the time kept my big mouth shut.<br />
About fifteen minutes after Stefan had turned around, he got back onto I-25, and started south. We didn&#8217;t have to go far, only about four miles until we got to the exit we needed. On the west side of I-25 was the Tank Proving Grounds. I assumed it also to be an active wargames venue, as in several of the valleys we could see, the Army had erected camouflaged tents and command centres. But there were no tanks or people in sight. Stefan was actually hoping to hear cannon shots all night.<br />
When we exited the highway, Stefan pointed out the wrong way to get to the KOA. The last time he had been there, he had turned right instead of left and drove right into an active wargame. I found this rather interesting considering the roads were lined with Tank Crossing signs. They look just like people crossing signs (yellow diamond-shaped signs with black silhouettes), but have little black tanks on them instead of people. Unfortunately, we forgot to take a picture of one of them.<br />
I started following all the instructions I could read verbatim. We turned left, and drove only about 150 feet, then turned right onto a small road that ran along the northbound lanes of I-25. We drove down that about a half mile, until the logo of the KOA sprang into view. Four quiet sighs hissed through the van as we saw the end of our 30 hour trek in view.<br />
Stefan sounded as happy as Marcel Marceau as he pulled in and prepared to get us signed in for the night. He pulled in our front of the KOA office, grabbed his wallet and darted inside. After a few minutes, Rebecca and I also got out and wandered inside to see what was taking so long.<br />
The office was combination administration depot and convenience store. The room was about 40 feet wide by 20 feet long, with a small jutting to the right of the door where souvenir t-shirts and hats were displayed. In the middle of the room was a small selection of foodstuffs, toiletries, and other necessities that are associated with camping and RV life. At the back of the room were three sets of glass doors, which at the time were papered up so you couldn&#8217;t see through them. (We found out the next morning that they were for a refrigeration cabinet, either just being installed or being upgraded.) To the left of the door was the administrative desk, which was where we found Stefan.<br />
The clerk was a young woman, probably somewhere in her 20&#8217;s. I doubted that she was the owner of the establishment, partly due to her apparent age, partly due to her countenance (which wasn&#8217;t exactly welcoming &#8211; we never saw her smile or heard her laugh). I assumed that it was partly due to the fact that it was less than half an hour until closing (which was at 20:00 in the evenings). She was an unremarkable woman, neither immediately attractive, nor offensive in appearance. She was about five foot, eight inches in height, about 180 pounds, with fairly long dirty blonde hair. She wore no visible makeup except for her cherry nail polish.<br />
Stefan was trying to figure out exactly what we needed. He had already signed up for a membership, a requirement for a stay at a KOA, and was being instructed on a special deal we had managed to stumble across that would potentially save us a lot of money. I wandered about the store as Stefan and Rebecca hovered on every word the clerk had to say. Rebecca paid particular attention to the hot tub and pool information. Unfortunately, the pool was still closed. But we still had about 20 minutes to get into the hot tub.<br />
Stefan took the camp map, which had our camping slot clearly marked, and we headed back to the van where Dhar was patiently waiting for us to return. Stefan drove carefully down the gravel roads, looking for the right slot for us to drive into. When we found it, we realized that we had come around the wrong way, and had to drive further down the path and return down the next path over. (This was because the water and electrical hook-ups were on the driver&#8217;s side of the van.)<br />
The camp itself was nothing spectacular &#8212; in fact it was the looking of the three we had seen. By &#8220;plainest&#8221;, I mean there were no trees next to the campsites, the grass still was slightly yellow from the winter snow, and what few trees there were had not yet started to grow leaves in any abundance. There were about five small gravel roads parallel to the road we drove on from I-25. Between the gravel roads were RV camping &#8220;pull-throughs&#8221;, designed to ease the process of parking and leaving. Just down from the main entrance were the bathrooms, pool and hot tubs which were all contained in the same building. Further down (east in direction) were half a dozen Kamping Kabins, a small log house that contained bunkbeds for those who want the camping experience without actually camping. (Not unlike a full-frontal lobotomy &#8230; for that feeling of death, without really dying.)<br />
Once we had parked, I took the keys from Stefan and went around to the storage compartment to hook the van up to the water and electricity. The running boards of the van behind the driver were converted into a storage compartment large enough to hold two golf bags. In the compartment we kept a small propane barbeque, a garden hose for the city water hook-up, a heavy duty 110 volt extension cable, an adapter to handle the standard 110 volt three prong outlets, and the van&#8217;s built-in 110 volt connection cable.<br />
At the bottom of the compartment is a round access hatch with a screw-in cover, used for running electrical and water supplies without having the compartment door open all the time. I ran the electrical cord out and plugged it in, then ran the water hose from the tap into the screw fitting. The tap leaked slightly, but the screw fitting on the van was watertight. I then closed the compartment and locked the door.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were about to leave when I got back in. Dhar was refusing to go into the hot tub with the rest of us, but was all for a much needed shower. I grabbed my swim trunks, towel, soap and shampoo, then hopped out of the van and went around the back. I opened the back door and removed my hiking backpack from the trunk space under the rear bench. The four of us then headed towards the showers.<br />
The air in Colorado was not as cold as Kansas had been that morning, and there was more sun to keep us warm. However, the sun was setting, and the air was cooling off with every minute. But it wasn&#8217;t uncomfortably cool. The four of us wearily trudged across the gravel roads, glancing at some of the technical marvels we were sharing the campground with. Many were enormous, some even had DirecTV dishes set up so the occupants wouldn&#8217;t miss a minute of Y &amp; R. We had chosen not to bring a TV with us (even though it was a possibility). We felt there was too much else to watch. (Though a TV and VCP would have been nice across Kansas &#8230; and Arizona &#8230; and New Mexico &#8230; Texas wasn&#8217;t so hot either &#8230;)<br />
The building was fairly simple &#8212; we entered about a third of the way along the side of the building. To our right was the pool and two hot tubs, though only one tub was open. To our left were the women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s washrooms. The washrooms were nothing special, having the necessary toilets, showers, and sinks. The three of us (men) immediately set down to getting ready. I jumped in a shower stall, put on my swim trunks, and quickly jumped into the shower to rinse myself off (common courtesy before climbing into a public water-based entertainment facility).<br />
The showers were strange, to the point of becoming annoying &#8212; they had only one knob, which unlike other single-knob showers I knew of, only turned off and on. The water temperature appeared to be fixed to slightly above what I considered to be comfortable. Yippee.<br />
Stefan was already outside by the time I was ready. I grabbed my clothes, stuffed them in my knapsack, and hauled it out to the hot tub, fenced away from the washrooms. I commented mentally that the fence looked rather odd indoors. Stefan and Rebecca were accompanied by a man, perhaps in his late 50&#8217;s or early 60&#8217;s.<br />
I had used a hot tub only a couple times before. Former neighbours of mine in Oakville had put in a hot tub in the early 1980&#8217;s, and as a child had used it a few times with the neighbour&#8217;s children, who were friends of mine. That family had kept the hot tub at over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which I found very uncomfortable and hard to get into. The hot tub at the KOA was thankfully different, its temperature was around body temperature. I climbed in with relative ease, and almost immediately, the 3,000 kilometres and 30 hours of driving vanished in the bubbles.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing what a simple device a hot tub is. Essentially a square (or round, depending on configuration) bathtub riddled with air hoses and nozzles, the hot tub is the only known device known to humanity that can suck out all the stress you have and provide sexual gratification at the same time. Though I&#8217;ve often heard those go hand-in-hand, if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun. Nevertheless, I was relieved to be bobbing in it.<br />
I was wearing a pair of swim trunks I had found left at my home almost ten years previous. They still fit me, though only barely. I hated them. I preferred to wear my bikini-style swim suit I had from my days in the swim team in high school. But as I had found out on a previous trip to Florida, most of my friends didn&#8217;t approve of me wearing them. As they put it, the swim suit didn&#8217;t &#8220;leave much to the imagination&#8221;. Not knowing how Rebecca, Dhar, or Stefan would respond, I chose not to bring it.<br />
Stefan was wearing a bikini-style swim suit, and Rebecca had her swim team swim suit, both in a matching black. I suddenly felt like an idiot for thinking I could offend either of them with my swim suit. I then reminded myself that I had also lost my physique from high school, and retracted my previous thought. Wearing such a swim suit, considering that I purposely bought it a size too small for racing purposes, it would have caused my thighs to pinch and bulge, which as you can undoubtedly imagine, is not particularly attractive.<br />
The stranger appeared to be your typical retired well-to-do office worker. He wore glasses, probably of a light to medium prescription, had white hair with a few flecks of original colour, and a wedding ring. We soon learned that his wife was to be joining him.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca had been talking with him quickly before I arrived, and I soon learned that he and his wife were on a trip much like ours, only in reverse. And not as fast. The man hailed from Detroit, and had been driving for the last few weeks through New Orleans, Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas and had just reached Colorado, at about the same time we had arrived. I guessed that the man knew where he was going, while we aimlessly bounced around the city figuring out what to do.<br />
Next thing I knew, I was shifting to the right to avoid being stepped on by the man&#8217;s wife as she climbed into the tub. I was not the only one who had been stung before by hot tubs that were too hot. It took her a moment to get in, but she too found it very relaxing. I suddenly felt very alone, the only single person in hot water. An interesting symbol, if you think about it a while.<br />
I quickly found out that the walls and floor of the tub were sculpted, with certain shapes installed containing jets to calm those aching muscles. A chair now rested under me, as did an air jet which ever so conveniently caused my trunks to fill with air. That annoying little trait made wish all the more that I had brought my Speedos with me.<br />
The five of us floated in the now-cramped tub for about another five minutes before I decided I was going to get have a shower before going back to the van. The tub, for all its relaxing power, reeked of chlorine. As a former member of the swim team, the smell of chlorine became a bit of an aphrodisiac &#8212; its prickly scent would make we swoon, almost pant in desire to swim. But after several years of abstinence, the smell was making me nauseous.<br />
I hauled myself out of the enveloping warmth, grabbed my knapsack, and headed back to the washroom. Dhar was stepping out having completed his shower. He smiled for a moment, about to ask me a question, when I asked if he could take my bag back with him while I showered. He was to ask the same question I proposed.<br />
The shower was hot, but after the hot tub, not as severely uncomfortable. I bathed in its heated glory, washing off the remaining grime collected after traversing almost three-quarters the distance across the continent. My hair felt free of the oil and dirt, my skin free of the suffocating dinginess. After ten minutes of scrubbing, I felt good enough to go to bed.<br />
I dried, changed into clean clothes, combed my hair, and jogged back to the van in the cooling air of dusk. Dhar was there reading one of the TourBooks. I stowed my toiletries on the shelf in the toilet closet, hung my towel to dry, and put my dirty clothes in a plastic bag. I then sat down and sighed in satisfaction of having arrived.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca showed up about five minutes later, and announced they were hungry. We all were. The last thing we had eaten were blue corn tortilla chips as we crossed Kansas some six hours earlier. It was decided that the hot dogs were the food of choice. I asked Stefan to grab one of the propane tanks from the trunk space (accessible through a hatch under the rear bench seat cushions) while I retrieved the barbeque from the running board compartment.<br />
Rebecca dug out the hot dogs, actually turkey dogs (Dhar refused to eat red meat, or drink milk &#8230; at least in most cases, he hadn&#8217;t quite kicked using milk in his coffee), and the buns. I set up the barbeque, got the butane lighter from the kitchen and started heating the burner. Despite its size, the barbeque heated very quickly and delivered a staggering amount of heat. It made quick work of the hot dogs. Not to mention toasting Rebecca&#8217;s buns. (Insert rude comments here.)<br />
Inside we set up the forward table, turning the driver&#8217;s and navigator&#8217;s seats to face the rear seats. In less than ten minutes, the hot dogs were ready and we all sat down to eat our first meal on the road. Rebecca, Stefan and I raised our milk in toast, Dhar his glass of Coke. Then we downed a package of twelve hot dogs. Like I said, we were hungry. By this time, it was barely 22:00.<br />
We had to close the side doors at one point, the air outside was becoming cool and Rebecca was getting cold. The van proved to be a very good protector against the cold, and also the heat. I suppose that all the insulation that Home &amp; Park cram into the van&#8217;s body tends to help.<br />
We made quick work of cleanup. Rebecca and Dhar washed the dishes, I put away the barbeque. The propane tank, however, seemed not to properly close. The tank was a simple design: the top was screwed into a regulator which had a small needle that opened the seal of the tank. But the seal wasn&#8217;t closing properly, and gas continued to leak out. I put the white cap back on and left it on the passenger side running board, in hopes it would seal overnight.<br />
The table was disassembled and the beds made. It was the first time I had truly had to set up both driver&#8217;s and navigator&#8217;s beds, and I was curious to see what it would look like. The chair were turned 90 degrees until they were back-to-back, and the rear seats unfolded. The beds turned out to be designed for people slightly shorted than Dhar and myself, but would suit our needs for the trip.<br />
We drew the blinds and locked the doors. I made an effort to brush my teeth in the sink, removing the last of the scum two days had brought on my mouth. Then I crawled into my brown sleeping bag, prepared to catch up on a day&#8217;s worth of sleep. I quickly noticed two things: there was a hole in my sleeping bag liner, and Dhar snored.<br />
I&#8217;ve always been jealous of people who can fall asleep quickly. I normally take between 15 and 30 minutes to fall asleep, and as much as two hours if I&#8217;m anxious about something. Dhar fell asleep in under five minutes, at least that was how long it took him to start snoring. Not that snoring bothered me too much &#8212; both my parents snored and ground their teeth. Even my first cat snored, and that was louder than both my parents! I just shook my head and prepared to pass out.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Alive and well, we&#8217;re now about to settle in for the night. It took us too long to find the stupid KOA, but we&#8217;re all set now. Probably lost a propane tank. Met some folks taking a similar trip as us, but only in reverse.Kansas was hideously boring.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke at a little after 08:00 that morning. I wasn&#8217;t the slightest but groggy, my usual waking state &#8212; I was excited. The day had finally come. I wandered out of my room. Dhar&#8217;s (rather, my sister&#8217;s) door was open, and he wasn&#8217;t anywhere to be seen. The bed didn&#8217;t even look slept in &#8212; either he stayed up all night, or was much neater than me (which, with all honest, can&#8217;t be all that difficult). Little did I know at the time that Dhar didn&#8217;t require a lot of sleep. I quickly jumped in and out of the shower and did all the neat and tidy things I could to make myself look presentable for the first day. Exactly why I did this I&#8217;m not too entirely sure &#8212; Stefan and Rebecca knew who I was, and what I was capable of. I guess it was mostly for Dhar&#8217;s sake, I didn&#8217;t want to frighten him &#8230; at least until we were out of the country.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan were still sleeping at the time, so I went outside as quietly as I could (not too easily done, the front door creaks quite loudly). I quickly found Dhar, having what appeared to be a deeply involving automotive discussion with my father. This didn&#8217;t particularly surprise me since my father had previously owned a Ford Probe as well, but had given it up due to a bad back &#8212; or to be more specific, the bad back the Probe gave him. As it turned out, Dhar had quickly learned as much about the van as I knew, which I knew would come in handy in the event that I forgot about something important. And when it comes to cars, I usually tend to forget everything.<br />
My father had already gone to the trouble of draining the fresh water tanks, an experience that told us how slow the tank emptied, and refilled it with clean water. He did this twice to make sure that the tank was free of Javex prior to our departure. (There&#8217;s nothing like the taste of bleach-contaminated water &#8230; and after that you&#8217;ll can taste nothing.) The water hose was coiled and put away along with the electrical cable in the running board storage compartment.<br />
A moment later, Stefan bounded out of the front door. Either someone had awaken him and Rebecca (the latter of which was not nearly as fast moving in the morning as the rest of us), or like Dhar and myself, were too anxious to sleep any longer. Dhar took this opportunity to make use of the shower, before starting what would be a 30 hour drive to Colorado.<br />
Our trip was ambitious (bordering on insanity, at least according to some of our friends and family), but not as ambitious as it had once been. In less than two weeks, we planned to visit Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Albuquerque, Roswell, San Antonio, Houston, New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, and Cleveland. Originally we had also planned to visit Death Valley, Los Angeles and San Diego. However, when our time became more and more constrained, and we realized just how large a trip we were looking at, we cut California right out of the picture. As it turned out, we didn&#8217;t even get to see all that we had planned (namely the entire state of Texas).<br />
At this time, I would like to provide some free advertisement for the Canadian Automobile Association (and its American counterpart). Planning a trip like this would have been a complete nightmare if it were not for the efforts of the CAA. Not to mention all the freebies that come with membership&#8230;<br />
A few years ago, my parents bought my sister and I memberships with the CAA. This was due mostly to both of us doing a great deal of driving to and from our beautiful national capital (Ottawa), sometimes in less than ideal weather. While it&#8217;s true that a CAA membership (or suitable equivalent) isn&#8217;t used very often, the times that you need it most are the ones you&#8217;re glad you have it. This trip was just one of those occasions.<br />
On a suggestion from my mother (suggestions being 50% of motherly duties, the remainder made of nagging, scolding, and guilt-tripping), I went to the Hamilton Automobile Club (the local branch of the CAA), and informed them of the trip. From the destinations that had become our route, the CAA created a &#8220;TripTik&#8221;, which is a city-by-city, highway-by-highway map of your journey. For the Interstate-uninitiated, this can be a Godsend, keeping you on the right track whilst traveling through the United States (though we realized that you&#8217;re better off if you&#8217;ve got a map book that covers Interstates). I also acquired a rather large collection of travel books for all the states that we would either be visiting or passing through. Most of these books got extensive use.<br />
And the membership is compatible with the AAA (the American Automobile Association), in the event you need roadside assistance somewhere in the United States &#8230; providing of course that you have a method of contacting them (there&#8217;s never a pay phone in the middle of the Mojave Desert when you need one). We never needed that kind of coverage, but the knowledge that we had access to it was enough to let us drive in peace and not worry about a major problem. Being a member also means less problems with health &#8212; for a mere $20, I also bought extra health coverage in America just in case I fell ill. Again, it wasn&#8217;t needed, but without it I would have had to pay a fortune in medical costs (getting sick in the States is not good for your health, bodily and financially).<br />
So for anyone planning an extensive trip in the United States, I strongly recommend getting a CAA membership (or AAA, if you happen to live in the U.S.). You never know when problems will come, and Murphy&#8217;s Law always says you&#8217;ll get them at the most inopportune time. This means that you&#8217;ll lose all your fluids in the middle of the desert. Luckily, we didn&#8217;t &#8212; but we were covered in case Murphy had stowed along for the ride (which was a bit doubtful, when you considered all the crap we brought along).<br />
Most people (except the good souls at the CAA) who I mentioned the trip to thought we were insane. Over 10,000 kilometres in less than two weeks was not what most people would consider a vacation. I, for one, cannot stand sitting in the sun for more than a day without my brain decalcifying from having nothing to do. The thought of visiting so many places seemed like a dream come true to me, I only wished that we had more time so that we could have included California in the itinerary.<br />
And besides, the purpose of the whole fling was as a road trip. All road trips are characterized by one thing: piling into a vehicle and driving a long distance. Until our &#8220;Road Trip From Hell&#8221;, I hadn&#8217;t been on a trip that exceeded six hundred kilometres in distance. I was embarking on a discovery tour, going places I had only seen in movies and TV, or read about in magazines and books. I would be doing things that a year previous I never even imagined. And the whole time I would enjoy myself &#8230; or at least that was the plan.<br />
But before we could pack ourselves into the van, my parents (specifically my mother, performing one of her lesser, but still necessary, motherly duties) turned into the kind of sappy parents you see parodies of in National Lampoon. The dreaded camera was out. We arranged ourselves like a police line up and politely grinned as my mother decided that she would take the first picture of the trip. (I didn&#8217;t bother to tell her that Dhar had already taken a picture the night before during the tour, to prove the size of the inside of the van.)<br />
As a last step before final boarding was called, I got the spare set of keys from the hall drawer. In case something befell the set of keys the current driver carried, my father suggested (in other words, decided) that we should bring spares. The safety of those keys were naturally entrusted to the most responsible person in the group. Stefan and Dhar looked a little taken aback when I handed the huge plastic keyring to Rebecca.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960421.10</strong><br />
<em>Day 1</em><br />
We&#8217;re ready to hit the road. Everyone showed up early last night, kinda caught me off guard. But we&#8217;re now ready to hit the road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus we piled into the van and strapped ourselves in for the longest drive we would have for the duration of the trip. Partly to appease my father, and to let the others get accustomed to the van &#8212; though mostly due to pride &#8212; I took the first shift of driving. I carefully nudged the van forward, tooted the horn (which if you ask me, is not nearly loud enough), rounded the corner and didn&#8217;t look back.<br />
At least until I got to Maplegrove Village, where my branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was located. I needed to make a quick transaction to prevent my cheques from bouncing. Less than five minutes later, we headed up Ford Drive to join with Highway 403. From there to the Trafalgar Road bypass, which in turn would take us to Highway 401. Less than a half hour from leaving home, I set the cruise control for 100 km/h, Dhar set the CD player, and we headed for Windsor, which would eventually take us to Detroit &#8212; our gateway to the United States.<br />
The stretch of highways from Oakville to Highway 8 I had driven many times, as that was the route I took to get to the University of Waterloo, where I had been studying English Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Those stretches took about half an hour to cover. Once we past that, I commented that I was traveling a portion of the 401 that I had never seen before. Stefan was rather startled by this revelation, I guess he believed that I had gone this way several times.<br />
Suddenly I realized that only Stefan had ventured to the Midwest previously. Dhar, Rebecca and myself were all proverbial virgins at that portion of the continent. I was no stranger to the West, my relatives live in Saskatchewan. However, that had been as far west as I had ever traveled with good memory. My mother claims to this day that I went to British Columbia as a wee babe to visit my mother&#8217;s Godmother, but my memory as a wee babe does not recall such a venture (although, oddly enough, it does include an incident of sitting down while wearing soiled diapers). As such, this trip would be my first real experience of the West.<br />
For the next two hours or so we continued along the 401, while forming what would eventually become our regular pastime &#8212; finding out more about each other. I learned a great many things not only of Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar, but also of myself. They were things I had known unconsciously, but only through such conversation did the truth come to the surface &#8230; but not necessarily to light.<br />
Less than an hour from the border, we stopped at what would become our last taste of Canada for almost two weeks: a batch of Tim Horton&#8217;s Timbits (donut holes to the uneducated). It was a fortuitous stop in more than one way, as I also needed to relieve a filled bladder. Once again, I was confronted with an odd insecurity I, and many other males have &#8212; an inability to use a urinal when other men are present.<br />
It&#8217;s rather annoying: you walk into the Men&#8217;s Room, stand in front of the urinal, unzip the front of your pants, and stand uncomfortably because for some reason none of the muscles in your groin care to cooperate and allow you to urinate. What causes it I have no idea. At one time I used to think it was a result of being insecure about my genitals. After several years of university, endless discussions of sex, and more &#8220;interesting&#8221; situations I care to recall, I choose to discount that theory &#8230; at least for myself. Besides, I&#8217;ve found that with practice the problem goes away.<br />
At any rate, this problem was quickly overcome with the use of one of the toilet stalls. I may have received a few odd looks, but less pressure at the waistline allows me the luxury to not care and proceed with my life.<br />
Within minutes, we piled back into the van and resumed our heading westward. An hour later, we entered Windsor, and caught our first glimpse of the Ambassador Bridge, peeking above the tops of the low-set skyline. Our time in Canada was drawing to a close. On an earlier suggestion from Stefan, we immediately began to look for Canadian Customs, so we could register our more expensive items on board. This was for two reasons: in the event something got stolen, or in case Customs believed that we were trying to smuggle something back.<br />
Before I knew it, I (still the current driver) had accidentally overshot the entrance to the Customs facility. Unfortunately, I had never entered into the United States through the Windsor gateway, I had always gone through either Niagara or Fort Erie. I knew where the Customs facilities were there. We quickly ducked into the area normally reserved for trucks going to the U.S. Rebecca and Stefan went into the office to find out how we would get back to the Customs building. The roads around the facility were all one-way roads, so we were justifiably confused.<br />
The instructions they returned with were cryptic at best (not unexpected from Canadian Customs officials). We had to ask someone else. This meant we had to cross through the toll access point. When we got to the booth, we asked the attendant what we had to do. She told us to go up the road a little, just pass the median, pull a U-turn and head back towards the Canadian Customs booths just below us. There we could find out what to do. We received a receipt in the event we got hopelessly lost and ended up back at the toll booths again.<br />
Once I had us pointed back in Canada again, we pulled up to the Canadian Customs booths. In less than three seconds we completely managed to confound the clerk, trying to explain to him what had just happened (it&#8217;s always fun to play &#8220;Stump the Chump&#8221;). But in a moment he understood and pointed us in the right direction to the Customs building. He also pointed out the route we would later take to get back to the bridge and avoid the toll booths. The man scribbled on a yellow piece of paper and handed it to us, not mentioning what it was for, then waved us on.<br />
We drove across a large roadway into the Customs complex, and found a pull-through parking slot. We immediately noticed the plethora of Government employees not doing anything (in other words, a typical Government installation). We were sadly not surprised at this, disappointed that our tax dollars were feeding apathy.<br />
We immediately set down to finding every last serial number of an expensive item we had. Fortunately, Home &amp; Park (who built the Behemoth) had already created a list of all the van&#8217;s expensive items. Dhar&#8217;s camera, lens and flash; my camera, lens and flash; the CD player; and Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s camera were recorded onto a piece of paper. Then Dhar and I wandered over to the main Customs building for approval.<br />
We expected a large lineup &#8212; it was a Government office, after all. Border crossings, although nicely informal, were often slow mainly due to volume. This was the first time I had ever gone through the Customs office before leaving the country, but I expected no difference in efficiency.<br />
Upon entering the doors, Dhar and I immediately noticed several people sitting down, a few people at kiosks, and a bunch of Government employees milling around doing nothing (different group of public employees, same work ethic). We paused a moment, and ventured to stand in line. Almost immediately, a woman behind the counter moved away from her discussion and motioned us to go to her. We informed her we only wanted to register the items we were taking over with us. She in turn asked if we had the serial numbers available. I produced the sheet that came with the van and the one we created, mentioning that some items didn&#8217;t have serial numbers. Even before I had finished speaking, the two sheets were stamped and the woman had walked away. Dhar and I looked at each other in surprise, shrugged our shoulders in disbelief, and headed back towards the doors. It was hard to say what bothered me more: the fact that she really seem to care about what she was doing, or that we were only in the building for 30 seconds.<br />
On the way back to the van, Dhar and I encountered two more Customs agents, who took the mysterious little piece of yellow paper from me, looked at it, then waved us on. Typically cryptic government shenanigans. We were probably passing notes between all the clerks. Now hopelessly confused, Dhar and I returned to a locked van (and me without my keys). Stefan unlocked the door, Dhar and I climbed in, and we prepared to finally leave Canada behind us.<br />
A minute later we had crossed the political border and were stuck in a traffic jam on the down side of the bridge. And we were in the slow lane. I had not yet learned all the nuances of the van, and wasn&#8217;t in the mood for trying to run into the next lane. We were in no hurry, so we decided to critique the City of Detroit instead.<br />
We were amazed at the decay we could see. Buildings crumbling, garbage everywhere, soot and grime seemed to cover everything. Even the air seemed dirtier than just across the river. Detroit seemed a large unwieldy mess of concrete, glass, and steel. It&#8217;s amazing how much culture shock one can receive merely by traveling less than one kilometre, the distance from Canada to the U.S.<br />
A half hour after crossing the bridge, we finally arrived at the U.S. Customs booth. It was time for 20 Questions. &#8220;Where ya goin&#8217;? Fer how long? Are ya takin&#8217; any fruit or vegetables? Where ya from? Is ev&#8217;one Canadian? Lessee yer birth certificates. You in back, lessee? Anythin&#8217; to declare? Okay, have a good time.&#8221; I almost expected to hear a &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; as we passed out of earshot.<br />
We breathed a sigh of relief, even if only psychologically, as we were now free to roam the vast expanses of America without any fear of something hanging over our heads. Dhar quickly dug out the TripTik again, and began deciphering the route to get out of Detroit and onto I-94. I didn&#8217;t quite catch the instructions completely, so Stefan attempted to clarify. It was only when the most responsible person of the trip got a hold of the TripTik did we finally get moving. When in doubt, ask a woman.<br />
Dhar started drooling less than five minutes into the States. We made the mistake of taking a route through the middle of the Motor City, the headquarters of the Ford Motor Corporation. Detroit was Dhar&#8217;s Mecca, and took every opportunity to find Ford billboards, and if he was lucky, an automotive plant. I waited with baited breath for the question: &#8220;Can we go on a Ford tour?&#8221;. As we exited Detroit into its suburbs, Dhar spotted Ford&#8217;s Special Vehicle Labs. It was there such geniuses as Shelby created some of the most well-known American sports cars in existence. It was there that Dhar&#8217;s Probe was given birth on a drawing board. He sighed as we passed westward.<br />
Outside of Detroit we got sidetracked. Actually, sidetracked isn&#8217;t the right word. We got lost. Ann Arbor creates a divide in I-94, causing the main route to go just south of the city, and a smaller state highway to go north of the city. At this point, none of us were completely comfortable with U.S. highways, and we weren&#8217;t ready for the split. In a panic of which route to take, we took the north route onto State Highway 23, away from I-94. At first we thought we were still on I-94. But when we realized that the red, white and blue I-94 highway markers were replaced with a white shield bearing the number &#8217;23&#8217;, we panicked. But only for a moment or two.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t help feel like morons for getting lost in America so quickly. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, we still had two weeks to find our way around. In only a matter of moments, someone figured out that Highway 23 was nothing more than a bypass of the city, and wasn&#8217;t going to get us hopelessly lost. We continued to follow the 23 around until we saw signs that guided us back to I-94.<br />
Road trips, by their very nature, tend to be performed by the seat-of-the-pants &#8230; in other words, unplanned. Ours was intended to be the exception &#8212; we had done a good deal of the ground work in advance. Or at least that was the impression I had given myself. Prior to leaving, we had established a long line of places we wanted to go and roads we had to travel. Due to our time constraints, we also knew that there wasn&#8217;t too much room for leeway. But as one can inevitably expect, plans change. Ours started to.<br />
Stefan, unbeknownst to me (and the others, much to our chagrin), wanted to go places we had never even discussed. First off, I&#8217;ll state for the record that Stefan is a nature nut. Now I&#8217;m not holding that against him &#8212; I am too, though not quite to the extent of Stefan &#8230; or Rebecca, for that matter &#8212; but he wanted more nature than we planned for.<br />
Colorado is a state full of natural wonders, most of which spring up due to two things: the geology and the general remoteness of certain parts of the state. The end result is an abundance of parks &#8230; a good deal of which Stefan wanted to visit. Under different circumstances, I might have gone along with the deal. Maybe if we had planned not to go to places like Las Vegas and New Orleans, perhaps I would have been more supportive. But I was in an explorative mood, and I wanted to see all that I could see, and an endless number of trees and mountains wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to explore.<br />
Thus we began to argue &#8230; okay, maybe argue isn&#8217;t the correct term &#8230; discuss loudly where we going. I quickly realized, with some relief, that I wasn&#8217;t alone. Rebecca and Dhar both wanted to see Vegas and at least one of the other places we had planned. Stefan was pushing for at least four days in Colorado. I knew full well that any more than two would result in having to axe something from the trip. (As it turns out, we had to axe the entire state of Texas, but that was for different reasons.)<br />
The discussion lasted for roughly fifteen minutes when the most responsible member of the group called an end because it was giving her a headache. We resolved to continue the discussion in Colorado Springs when we were settled in.<br />
We weren&#8217;t even out of Michigan.<br />
The roadside billboards became, for a while, a focus of some fascination for us. In Canada, the public has prevented the plethora of eyesores that American urban highways are noted for. The diversity of the ads, and the names of the products they advertise provided us with a great deal of entertainment, especially Dhar.<br />
Earlier that morning, I learned of Dhar&#8217;s habitual rhymes: &#8220;Awesome Possum&#8221;, &#8220;Starvin&#8217; Marvin&#8221;, &#8220;Gotta Stop Lollipop&#8221;, and so forth. Cute, but endlessly annoying if left unchecked for a few days. (Not to mention the fact that it was a habit I was afraid I would adopt over the course of the trip.) Luckily, for me, Dhar either grew tired of the habit, or he didn&#8217;t use it very often in the first place. Either way, the rhymes were infrequent.<br />
So what does Dhar&#8217;s habitual rhyming have to do with billboards? Shortly before we entered Lansing, Dhar nearly leapt out of his seat. For a moment he was stammering about something he had seen, and we couldn&#8217;t understand him. When asked to repeat his statement, we learned that we had just passed a billboard advertising, and I swear I&#8217;m not making this up, a store called Starvin&#8217; Marvin. Dhar swore then and there that he would have a picture of a Starvin&#8217; Marvin store before the trip was over.<br />
I continued to drive until we arrived in Lansing, Michigan. By that point I had been driving for about six hours, and was feeling tired. This was my first introduction to Interstate Rest Areas. This was part of Dwight Eisenhower&#8217;s plans for a great American highway system. About every 20 miles or so outside of urban areas one can find small parking lots, usually with toilets, at the side of the Interstate. These quickly became havens for us, where we stopped to use the bathrooms, cook our dinners, or catch enough sleep to keep driving. I used the opportunity to call home.<br />
Now don&#8217;t go callin&#8217; me a momma&#8217;s boy &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t homesick, just absent-minded. I had forgotten two very important things: addresses to mail postcards, and my CAA health insurance number. The latter I could do without until a major crisis developed, but the addresses I would need much sooner.<br />
AT&amp;T (or whoever ran the local payphones) has a particularly annoying collect call system. I had to actually say into the phone &#8220;Collect Call&#8221; to place the call. Even though I had to key in the number, I had to vocalize what I wanted. Some programmer could&#8217;ve made everyone&#8217;s life a lot easier but just having someone press &#8216;1&#8217; or &#8216;2&#8217;, and so forth. Humanity tries to make life too easy, and ends up making it more complicated.<br />
My mother immediately panicked (a typically mother-like thing to do), not expecting to hear from me so soon. I reassured her that the only reason I was calling was to get the information I had left behind. A moment later I had the addresses safely jotted down in my organizer, but the health insurance was nowhere to be found. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned about this, but decided to make another check of my stuff to make sure I didn&#8217;t actually manage to pack it when I wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
We&#8217;re well into the States now, despite an unintentional detour. I got Scott&#8217;s, Tara&#8217;s, Chris&#8217; and Kathryn&#8217;s addresses &#8211; I should be okay from here. It&#8217;s 4:37 now, and we still have some 18 hours until we get to our final destination.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Stefan volunteered for the next shift of driving, and I retired to the couch in the rear to get some sleep. We had plans to drive in a six hour rotation, so that we could easily drive through the night and arrive in Colorado Springs as soon as possible. Thus it made sense for me to get some sleep so we wouldn&#8217;t have any problems with me driving come morning.<br />
However, I had always had problems sleeping in cars, so I doubted heavily that I would be able to sleep at all while we were on the road. Nevertheless, I went to the back, stretched myself out on the bench, buckled myself in so I wouldn&#8217;t fall off, and tried to get a couple hours of sleep. I closed my eyes and began a mental exercise to try and get myself to sleep. I&#8217;m normally a heavy sleeper, but it takes a long time for me to get to a heavy sleeping state. Over the years I developed a mental exercise which causes me to reflect sleepiness back into my mind, thus amplifying the effect. But it wasn&#8217;t working in the van.<br />
Next thing I knew, we were exiting I-94 somewhere just inside the Indiana border. I had no idea how long I had been asleep, but I guessed at no more than an hour. It was time for our first fill-up of American gasoline, and our first shot at American gas-bar convenience stores. I quickly dug out my personal organizer, which was doubling as our travel expenses log. I jotted down the distance we covered on the tank of gas, and prepared to take the rest of the information regarding refill volume and price. But in the meantime I opted for disappearing into the store and getting something to eat.<br />
Never before had I seen a Subway in a gas station &#8230; a normal gas station. This wasn&#8217;t one of those mega-stations that started appearing along Highway 401 in Ontario, but an average sized gas station one would expect to see in any town or city. But inside was a Subway sandwich bar, complete with bread bakers. Only the seats and tables were missing. As near as I can figure, the only reason for such things was that it was next to an Interstate.<br />
But I was hungry, and not about to debate the reasoning for placing the Subway where it was. I quickly found out that the prices in the States (or at least along the Interstate) were almost identical to those in Canada, not counting the conversion. In other words, the American Subway was more expensive than the one just off-campus that I used to go to on an infrequent basis. Thus I opted for the cheapest sub they had available that I liked &#8212; the Subway Club.<br />
The toppings were all standard: lettuce, olives, hot peppers, green peppers, onions, pickles. But instead of normal mustard (which is French&#8217;s in Canada, if I&#8217;m not mistaken), it was Dijon mustard. And instead of Italian dressing (which is &#8220;sub sauce&#8221; in Canada), I had virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. Added an interesting zing to the sub, but overall didn&#8217;t change the flavour much.<br />
I quickly discovered that I wasn&#8217;t as hungry as I thought I was, and ate only half the sub. I tossed the rest in the fridge for later. Dhar and Rebecca promptly decided they were going to have dinner. Dhar vacated the navigator&#8217;s position, and I took over. It was about this time that we entered the Fort Wayne area, which in other words meant that it was time for a navigator to start giving directions.<br />
Fort Wayne was one of the easier places for us to travel through &#8212; we never left the highway we were on. Despite the fact we ran through Fort Wayne at around 18:00, we didn&#8217;t encounter any traffic. Living near Toronto brings you a certain level of awareness of time. You know that there are several hours in the day that you simply don&#8217;t drive on the highways because you hit traffic so nasty you want to pull all you hair out. For example, rush hour in Toronto lasts from about 15:30 to nearly 18:30. But in Fort Wayne, the traffic never came &#8230; that was when I remembered that it was still Sunday.<br />
It&#8217;s often amazing how little meaning days of the week have when you go on a vacation. You just keep track of the actual dates themselves &#8212; you know you have to be in city X by the 23rd, and in canyon Y by the 25th. I was amazed at how quickly I forgot what the day was.<br />
Shortly after Dhar and Rebecca finished eating, Dhar lay down to get some sleep. He had volunteered for the late night shift, and wanted to be awake for it. I tried to convince myself that I would also need more sleep later on, since I would be driving again come the morning. But I knew that would be difficult, since I was so excited to finally be on another trip, the first one in five years.<br />
Stefan drove for the next four or five hours without any incident. It was an uneventful portion of the trip, we found new ways to keep ourselves interested. Several times I thought about opening my Linguistics text I had brought, so I could get some reading done. But every time I thought about it, the thought of doing school work while on a vacation seemed appallingly trite. Thus it remained packed in one of the upper compartments where I promised to forget about it for at least a week.<br />
My duties as navigator were required when we entered Indianapolis, shortly after nightfall. Here we moved up a highway, from I-69 to I-70. But to do so, we had to skirt around the edge of the city on the I-465. The Americans are rather interesting about how they design their highways &#8212; they seem to regularly build rings around their cities so travelers only need enter the city if they need do, unlike cities such as Toronto where you get mired in traffic if you pick your time poorly.<br />
Scarcely a half hour later, we were watching Indianapolis fade away into the greyness behind us. Already the sky was darkening as clouds began to form above us. It was a foreshadow of what we would receive later on that evening.<br />
A few hours later we arrived in St. Louis. It was dark and foggy, but even through the glare of the city lights, we could see the famous Gateway Arch off in the distance. I woke Dhar and Rebecca to view the sight, though I must admit, I seemed to be the only one interested in it. Another half hour, and we were exiting the St. Louis city limits, and re-entering the enveloping darkness of the Interstate.<br />
By this time, Stefan&#8217;s stint behind the wheel had ended, and he wanted to relax a while. Driving the van wasn&#8217;t at all tiring under normal circumstances, but when you had to fight the wind to keep the van in the lane you quickly got worn down. Fortunately, the wind had started to die down with the coming of night, but the damage had already been done and Stefan had to take a break for a few hours.<br />
Rebecca was the next victim in line. We pulled off the highway, down an off-ramp, crossed the road and got on the on-ramp, stopping just as we got onto it. Quickly, Stefan jumped out the door as Rebecca slid between the driver and navigator&#8217;s chairs and took her seat. The doors behind me opened and shut, there was a hasty clicking of belt buckles, and the van started back onto the Interstate.<br />
Prelude to disaster: Dhar and I used the same mirror settings, with the odd minor adjustment. Taking over from Stefan usually meant another larger adjustment to compensate for Stefan&#8217;s height. Under the best of conditions, Rebecca never would&#8217;ve been able to see with Stefan&#8217;s mirror settings. We were unknowingly about to throw Rebecca into conditions so bad they made me cringe. And we forgot to change the mirrors.<br />
After only a few minutes of driving, we realized our first major mistake &#8212; letting Rebecca drive in the dark. It&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s a bad driver (I&#8217;d never actually been in a car when she was driving), it&#8217;s that Rebecca wasn&#8217;t ready for the task. Back home in Kingston, Rebecca usually only drove about town during the day in her Dodge Laser (for those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kingston is a very peaceful city on the south side of Ontario, about half-way between Toronto and the Quebec border). We had put her behind the wheel of a three tonne, eight foot three inch high, 19 foot long, blind spot laden behemoth &#8230; in the middle of the night. Rebecca was justifiably worried.<br />
But we made efforts to try and adjust the mirrors so she could make it a couple hours, gain some experience, and let Dhar rest up before his early morning shift. But as Murphy&#8217;s Law always states: if anything is already wrong, it can only get worse.<br />
It began to rain.<br />
Heavily.<br />
I almost expected to see an off-ramp sign for Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Most of the work was on my family&#8217;s newly-purchased RoadTrek 190 Versatile, a Dodge Ram van converted into a small motorhome. It was the result of my aunt&#8217;s interest in the RoadTrek company, and my father&#8217;s interest in toys. I doubt my family would have been so quick in purchasing the RoadTrek (which would become to be known as &#8216;The Behemoth&#8217;) if this trip had never been thought of.<br />
When the trip had first been planned, we looked into renting a car or minivan to support us for our trip. But the costs were too high &#8212; we would be adding almost $200 per person before adding the cost of gasoline. The cost was so prohibitive, I volunteered my 1991 Plymouth Acclaim to ferry us about the United States. Not nearly as comfortable as a minivan, but certainly a lot cheaper than renting.<br />
Somewhere along the line, my parents found out about the trip (sometimes I think they&#8217;re telepathic &#8230; either that or I&#8217;m becoming more forgetful with age). Not that I was trying to keep the trip a secret &#8212; they had to eventually find out. My father, in one of what I have come to call his &#8220;moods&#8221; decided that a RoadTrek would be a good idea to take on such a trip. Seeing the possibilities (not the least of which was a lower cost for accommodation, and more space for stretching out), I chose not to argue.<br />
At the time, my family owned a 37&#8242; trawler, moored in Penetanguishene, just off Georgian Bay. But the upkeep on the boat, the costs required to maintain it, and the extremely short amount of time we could use it each year caused problems. The fact that only my father was experienced in driving the ship meant that neither my sister nor I could take it out without the presence of dear old dad. Not to mention the fact that a VHF license was required in the event we needed to use the radio. To make a long story short, my parents had already decided to sell the boat.<br />
So why not just sell the boat and leave it at that? Well, my parents (bless &#8217;em both) are registered members of CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons. My father has been unofficially retired since about 1990, when his employer decided to force him to quit. He played around with a few other jobs, but I think it was mostly to prevent boredom. But in the past couple of years, dad calmed down and accepted the fact that he could do whatever he wanted.<br />
Selling the boat left us without a form of recreation outside the house. My parents, in quasi-retirement (my mother continues to do bookkeeping for a few local companies, and my father is too stubborn to relax), needed such a medium for their extra time when they weren&#8217;t doing something. The loss of the boat would mean that they would have no way of seeing the countryside without driving. And driving the car had its limits since you either had to return home at the end of the day, or spend a great deal of money going to hotels and restaurants.<br />
Enter RoadTrek: take your home with you. Although my mother liked the idea, the thought of driving everywhere was none too appealing for her. She never consciously would admit to it, but her attitude during the discussions of what to do continually said: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want any part in this&#8221;. But in the end my father, my sister and I all agreed that buying the van was a good idea. My mother continued to smile and nod quietly.<br />
The van was picked up on a Thursday (three days from departure) from the dealer in Kitchener, where the dealer promptly gave my father and I a detailed breakdown on the operation of the vehicle. This involved the use of the liquid propane system; the black water, grey water, and fresh water tanks; the storage spaces; the hook-ups (water and electricity); the furnace; the hot water heater; air conditioner; sink; fridge; shower; toilet; and a few specifics about the underlying vehicle. This took almost three hours.<br />
On the morning of the 19th of April, plans were made to get all my gear ready to go, get a barbeque, garbage pail, dishes, food, money, tools, and a few other odds and ends for the van. My father and I found a barbeque at the local Wal-mart, despite some confusion with the pricing and stocking of the materials. We also bought an oil filter so we could make an oil change prior to departure.<br />
A garbage pail that would suit the deep blue interior of the van was not to be found anywhere. As such, I was directed to find a pail in the States. (This was a task uncompleted since not once did I see a waste bin for a van, let alone a deep blue one.) Money was also an uncompleted task, since I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to the bank to withdraw $100 in American funds.<br />
On the morning of the 20th, I received my first real trial by fire, by taking the van up to my Aunt Ruth&#8217;s in Caledon East, just north of Toronto. The trip opened my eyes to just how sensitive the van was to winds, and how poorly it drove when it was unloaded. The van&#8217;s height, eight feet three inches, created an excellent wall that the wind could push very easily. This problem was overcome by loading material into the van, and by increasing the air pressure in the tires.<br />
Upon returning home, it rained. This was a problem because my father had intentions of changing the oil before the next day, departure day. When the rain stopped, he donned his coveralls, and pulled himself under the van to change the oil and attempt to lubricate the joints. Next we filled the fresh water tank to test it for ourselves. It was then we found a label in the storage compartment that told us to clean the tank before use.<br />
The Javex bottle was mysteriously waiting for me at the back door when I arrived to retrieve it, a complete coincidence. The tank was filled partly with bleach, and the rest with water. We then plugged the van into the house to charge the main battery, and set the fridge to cool overnight. The next morning we would flush the tanks and refill them with fresh water for the trip.<br />
That night, I packed and gathered together all the things I thought I was going to need for the trip: CD player (which I had bought earlier that day to replace my old one which seemed to have given up the will to spin), CDs (with specific titles suggested by Stefan and Rebecca), clothes, a couple hats, shoes, sandals, two books, and my journal and log book. At around midnight, I decided to check email.<br />
Following a pattern that had been ongoing for months, I had more messages from Rebecca and Stefan. I went over a few older ones to make sure I hadn&#8217;t forgotten something, and made note of a few other things mentioned in the newer messages. From everything I had read, I assumed that I would see them and Dhar at around noon the next day. No sooner than had I logged off, the doorbell sounded.<br />
(Okay, so it isn&#8217;t a doorbell, it&#8217;s another toy. The doorbell is musical, the result of my father doing strange things. It&#8217;s unique &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen, or heard, anything else like it, but after 15 years of use it&#8217;s no longer anything really fun. And it&#8217;s not something you want to hear at a quarter after midnight.)<br />
Almost as soon as I heard it, I knew who it was. None of my friends in Oakville would come by after 20:00 without checking with me much earlier. It could only have been Dhar, Stefan and Rebecca. I was right.<br />
I was shocked.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t ready.<br />
They were.<br />
When I opened the door to greet them, I suddenly realized that my parents had already enabled the security system, it started beeping immediately. A quick jump at the controls avoided a rather loud awaking for my father, who was already in bed.<br />
Suffice to say, I apologized for not being able to leave that night, and offered them a bed and a shower in the morning. Both Dhar and Stefan were a little agitated at not leaving, but sleep sounded good to both of them (they both had written exams earlier that day). Rebecca didn&#8217;t seem to really care one way or the other. But before turning in for the night, I offered a tour of what would become our mobile accommodations.<br />
Like any normal van, the RoadTrek has five doors: the driver&#8217;s door, the &#8220;shotgun&#8221; (or in our case, the navigator) door, a pair of doors behind the navigator, and a large door at the rear. Inside, RoadTrek put together a very nice, comfortable place to live for two weeks. The driver and navigator&#8217;s chairs are both orthopedic, with lumbar support controls. These chairs are meant to be used for long hauls, like our long stints behind the wheel. The chairs were fitted with both a front / back slide, and a swivel so they could turn 180 degrees and face backwards. This was necessary in part because when locked in a 90 degree position, these chairs formed part of the forward bunks.<br />
Behind the driver and navigator are two large seats. Unlike the front seats, these are built not to turn, slide or even tilt back. Instead, these chairs are disassembled to form the rest of the forward bunks. The seat portion of the chairs pulls out. The back slides up, and then is placed where the seat portion used to be, forming a longer pad. When the front seats are rotated 90 degrees, they form a reasonably comfortable bunk, although people over five foot five inches might find it a bit short.<br />
Between the two chairs is a lowered floor. Home &amp; Park (the builders of the RoadTrek vans) cut out an 18 inch by eight foot chunk out of the floor, and lowered it about four inches. This lowering, with the addition of the raised roof, provided me with exactly enough clearance to walk around without having to duck my head. Stefan wasn&#8217;t so lucky. At the front of this lowered section, between the two rear seats, is a hole to allow the setting of a table into the floor.<br />
Towards the back of the lowered floor is the kitchen / washroom area. On the driver&#8217;s side of the van is the kitchen: a sink, two burner gas stove, and a microwave oven (usable only when the van is connected to a 110 volt electrical system). Above the stove is a fan with a light to funnel away smells and waste gases from the burners. Above and below the sink are several cabinets for storing dishes and food. (The van has a great deal of storage space &#8212; and we used all of it.)<br />
Across from the sink, on the navigator&#8217;s side, is the toilet. This is a manual flush system, requiring the user to step on a pedal to flush the toilet. The toilet was contained in a two by six foot cabinet, with doors that swung out to create a barrier across the van for privacy. Also in the cabinet was the shower curtain and shower head. None of these were ever used during our trip, we made use of the showers at the KOAs we stayed at. In the middle of the ceiling of the kitchen area was ceiling fan and skylight. The fan had a thermostat which could be set with a dial to keep the fan going until the interior was a comfortable temperature.<br />
Behind the kitchen at the back of the van was the main bunk. Normally, it appeared as an L-shaped couch. In front of the couch in the floor was hole for another table, which we rarely set up. When unfolded, the couch became a double bed, just wide enough to fit most people stretched out. Just below the couch was the furnace for those cold mornings, and above it the air-conditioner for those hot nights. Like the microwave, the air-conditioner required a 110 volt system.<br />
The interior of the van was finished with a deep blue carpet with matching seats. The walls were a light grey fabric resembling office dividers (though not quite so visually unpleasant &#8230; that&#8217;s assuming you find woven grey polyester appealing). All of the cabinets and doors were either solid oak or oak-laminated particle board, stained a nice medium brown, kind of an &#8220;off-coffee-with-double-cream-and-sugar&#8221;. The counter top in the kitchen was white. The ceiling was white vinyl (resembling those really bad car seats from the 70&#8217;s), with three windows at the front of the raised roof.<br />
Following the tour, we unloaded Dhar&#8217;s Ford Probe, putting most of the contents into the van. The remainder came with them back into the house. After setting the alarm, I informed my guests not to open any of the doors during the night, or face the music (or the siren, depends if the wailing suits your musical tastes or not).<br />
I took Stefan and Rebecca downstairs to the TV room (so named because that&#8217;s where my friends and I watched endless hours of Star Trek, the X-Files, and the Simpsons), where we had our fold-out bed (a necessity in any family). Dhar was given the option of having a room all to himself for the evening, namely my sister&#8217;s room (my sister was finishing school in Ottawa at the time, and wouldn&#8217;t be home until we were well on our way). In less than five minutes, Dhar was settled in.<br />
I continued to run about for the next half-hour, assembling what remained of the things I was bringing, retrieved the sleeping bag, put out my pack sack of clothes, the CDs, books and so forth in the front hall. By the time I was done it was almost 02:00, and I was exhausted. I knew that the next day was going to be a long one, so I headed to bed. Unfortunately, I could hardly sleep. I was too excited. A long awaited trip was about to begin, and I so desperately wanted to leave.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entire scenario began back in the heady days of what most university students refer to as &#8220;spring break&#8221;. In many cases, this involves an exodus from the country (Canada) to a warmer climate for approximately one week of drinking, frolicking, debauchery, and general mayhem. In our case, it was a break from classes to allow us to get caught up in the work we hadn&#8217;t yet started.<br />
It was also the time that friends of mine had set aside to bring their wedding party together. Scott E.<!--lliott--> and Teresa D.<!--unat--> had approximately eleven or twelve people in their wedding party, and arranged to have eleven of them meet in Kitchener for a few hours of introductions and too much food. Stefan S.<!--cherer-->, like myself, had been drafted as one of Scott&#8217;s groomsmen.<br />
Both Stefan and Rebecca J.<!--ohnston--> were long-time friends of Scott, remembering him back to when the three of them were in high school in Rainy River in northern Ontario. Rebecca wasn&#8217;t a part of the wedding party per se, but attended the party as part of the invitation and to visit with friends.<br />
During the course of the evening (which involved many games, some of which gave us unexpected, albeit humourous, insights into certain people&#8217;s sex lives), Stefan asked me what I had planned to do at the end of the term. I replied that I had no single thing in mind outside of starting my job. It was then that the idea of a road trip was first suggested. But unlike many other road trips that my friends or I had experienced, this was to be a voyage of an entirely different breed.<br />
Over the course of the next two months, about a hundred email messages passed between the inboxes and outboxes of Rebecca, Stefan, and myself, all intended to coordinate and plan the first vacation I would see in over 5 years. The logistics at times seemed to be a nightmare, and more than once the trip came on the verge of getting canceled. But in the end, the pieces fell together, and the plan came to fruition.<br />
But before you continue any further, you should learn more about who I was traveling with. (It&#8217;s kind of important, seeing as I played as much a role in the whole fiasco as them.) Unlike some of my previous excursions, this cast is a small one, so you can come to get to know these people much better and much quicker.<br />
I first met Rebecca J.<!--ohnston--> in the summer of 1992, when I was working for Digital Equipment of Canada Ltd. in Ottawa. One night I was visiting with Scott at his place in Nepean (Scott was working for the Federal Government at the time), when the door bell rang. A moment later Stefan, Rebecca, and Eric walked in the room. Eric is Rebecca&#8217;s son, though not by Stefan (Eric&#8217;s father is often euphemistically referred to as &#8220;The Sperm Donor&#8221;).<br />
I must admit that at first I was immediately attracted to Rebecca &#8212; she is a very beautiful woman. When I later learned of Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s relationship, I put aside any attraction for Rebecca (it&#8217;s a personal policy of mine not to interfere in other&#8217;s relationships). This relationship has since culminated with her second child (and Stefan&#8217;s first), a darling girl named Thea.<br />
Rebecca is a strong woman: physically, mentally, and emotionally. Strong willed and highly intelligent, it&#8217;s hard to wage a battle of the wits with her &#8212; unless you happen to be well educated and open-minded, you are bound to lose. Having graduated from Queen&#8217;s University in Kingston with a degree in Women&#8217;s Studies, Rebecca pursued volunteer work at the &#8220;Sex Clinic&#8221; where until just prior to the trip she was its director. A full-time position as mother and wife with a husband still in school, Rebecca also searched for a full-time paying job. At the time of the trip, Rebecca was 22 years old.<br />
All I new of Dharmendra N.<!--oorhasan--> prior to the trip was that he was one of Stefan&#8217;s male classmates, and had a penchant for computers and cars (which according to Rebecca, was all that Dhar and Stefan ever spoke of). Beyond that, I knew nothing of what would eventually become a compatriot on our tour of the Midwest.<br />
Like any Queen&#8217;s engineering student I have ever met, Dhar (as he preferred to be called) was well versed in cars. (This habit among engineers is still mostly a mystery to me &#8212; even Computer Engineers seem to know far too much about their Honda Preludes.) As Rebecca predicted, Stefan and Dhar talked at length of cars throughout the trip, despite regular protests from Rebecca (often in the form of a change in topic). Dhar was also a computer wizard, having already designed several networks for the Federal Government of Canada.<br />
His parentage of African origin, Dhar was a naturalized Canadian, and like many Canadians he hated the winter. From his parents he developed his taste for spicy food, a taste that unfortunately was never truly satisfied during the trip &#8212; even a true Cajun dish in New Orleans couldn&#8217;t bring tears to his eyes or sweat to his brow. Dhar was 26 at the time of the trip.<br />
I met Stefan S.<!--cherer--> at the same time I met Rebecca. Admittedly, I got along with Stefan much better than I did Rebecca at first, but that was due to two things: a sharing of common interests, and my discomfort around Rebecca (a result of my aforementioned attraction &#8212; I was a very shy person back then).<br />
Stefan first came to Canada from Germany at the age of 12. He quickly learned the English language and many of the customs. Even today he makes the odd slip of the tongue (although I&#8217;ve never caught one), and gets confused when he hears German then tries to speak English, but his efforts to fit in are awe-inspiring.<br />
Stefan possesses many qualities about him that I admire, not the least of which is his complete and utter devotion to his family &#8212; both his parent&#8217;s family and the one he has with Rebecca. I can only hope that should I ever reach the stage where I am to become a parent, I can possess as much love and strength for my family as Stefan has for his.<br />
Stefan was finishing his second-last year of his Electrical Engineering program at Queen&#8217;s University, and greatly looking forward to getting out. Many times he complained about the style of education he received there, and many times wished that he had gone to the University of Waterloo instead. Stefan was 21at the time of the trip.<br />
Lastly there was me, the Observer. More formally, I am Geoff Sowrey. At the time of the trip, I was 23 years old, having completed 98% of my university education. I won&#8217;t give you any description of me, I figure that as you read this incantation you will learn who and what I am.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A Dream&#8230;<br />
With a start, I realized that the fire I had felt had suddenly died off. No longer did I feel the burning from within and outside. I was cool once more, and I was clear headed. Once again, I was on a beach. Exactly where, I couldn&#8217;t tell, but it was warm wherever I was. Looking around me, I could see huge expanses of beach to the left of me and to the right of me. Behind were dense thickets of palm trees. All I could hear was the roar of the sea, and a faint mandolin that played an all too familiar tune, yet unnameable.<br />
The thickets moved for a moment, and I was joined by my friends. Chris, Hil, Kathryn, James, Linda, J, Ali, Stuart and Therese. They came and sat down next to me, and said not a word. We faced the west, for that was where the sun sets. Silently, we gazed into the horizon, to the disc of sinking gold. The orange glow illuminated in the front, casting long, dark shadows behind.<br />
The music grew gradually louder, to the point where it played softly from all around. No-one made move to determine from where the music came from. We all knew the song now, no-one cared where it came from. Everything was peaceful, we were together. Then, off to our right, a male voice said:<br />
Good night.<br />
James&#8217; alarm was almost immediately disconnected. It was 4:00, and none of us had enough sleep to keep us going for any length of time. We had to be on the bus for 5:15, instruments and all, so we could get to the airport for our flight at 10:05 that morning. Seem a little early to get up to catch a plane? It is if you&#8217;re leaving from Orlando, but not if you&#8217;ve got to travel to the west coast of Florida and leave from St. Petersburg / Clearwater.<br />
The last of our packing was done, and then we proceeded to clean the room up. That took some time. We had taken great care to keep the room from looking like a pig-sty (though we had successfully trashed the room about ten minutes after getting into the room on the first day), but still managed to make a mess. Because we had taken some care, clean-up didn&#8217;t take too long. At about 5:00, Suzi appeared at our door (finally), ready to inspect our home away from home. Agreeing with its condition after making a final clean in a couple of places, we gave her the key, hauled our stuff down to Dick who was waiting below.<br />
While we were packing and cleaning, Stuart was doodling. But he had a purpose. His doodle was a picture of &#8220;Bus From Hell&#8221; (Bus One). It was a gift to Dick for his thankless job, and all the help he had been during the past five days. It would later be supplemented with donations.<br />
Once the bus had been loaded, luggage, instruments and equipment all, we hopped on. Then things began to go awry. Murphy&#8217;s Law (or at least one of them) states that the chances of a bus malfunction are directly proportional to the necessity of that bus, and where you have to be in a certain amount of time. English translation: the damn thing wouldn&#8217;t start.<br />
I&#8217;m by no means a mechanical whiz, but I do know when an engine doesn&#8217;t turn over. Yes, we had a problem. So while Dick fiddled around with the battery, James began action, passing a sheet that everyone on the bus was to sign their name on, and an envelope to donate money to the &#8220;Fund for Dick&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Education&#8221;. After the second try to start the bus (which failed), people began to leave as it was getting a little warm in there. James blocked the way out, and wouldn&#8217;t let anyone leave until they had at least signed their names.<br />
The populace of Bus One gathered together on the sidewalk that surrounded the first parking lot. Dick had to use Bus Two&#8217;s radio to contact help (Warren was gone by then), but we didn&#8217;t know how long we had to wait. James continued collecting cash. Chris and I quickly noticed that we stood a chance of being stranded in Florida. Oh bummer! I guess we have to go to Daytona after all! I returned to the bus for a moment for three things: my camera, Stothart&#8217;s camera and my journal. I took a photo, Stothart took two or three, and I wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40791.06</strong><br />
<em>Day 6</em><br />
Right now we should be about a half hour to St. Petersburg. However, Bus #1 experienced technical difficulties and we&#8217;re still at the Days Inn. Crewe and Stothart were going to judge the success of the trip by the number of couples formed. Hil and Shawn formed one. I can safely say that I did not get any closer to a relationship than I was before I left. Oh yeah,<br />
BUTTCHEESE!!
</p></blockquote>
<p>At around 6:05 that morning, a half hour after we were supposed to have left, the repair truck appeared on the scene. Two minutes later, Bus One roared to life. We immediately hauled aboard, not wasting any time. But we didn&#8217;t leave right away. First we had to make presentations. So James got to the front of the bus, was given the mike to the p.a. system and presented Dick with Stuart&#8217;s drawing, and over $100.<br />
Dick was pleased, to use an understatement. He wasn&#8217;t exuberant, but he was delighted to have driven us around. Then he told us about his &#8220;I Love Me Wall&#8221;, which had all his pictures, trophies and whatnot, dating from his days in the navy. Dick added that Stuart&#8217;s picture was destined for that wall. I&#8217;ll tell ya, that&#8217;s an honour &#8211; and I mean it too! Then Dick swore to have us in St. Pete&#8217;s in time for our flight.<br />
By 6:25, we were on the highway, heading west. It was still dark outside, but you could just see the patchy fog hugging the ground through the breaks in the trees. I listened to AC/DC for the umpteenth time, to keep myself from falling asleep. I like to experience life whenever possible. Besides, I hate sleeping in road vehicles &#8211; it&#8217;s annoying.<br />
Over the course of a couple hours, the country side got brighter and brighter, the sun was slowly rising behind us as we streaked across the panhandle. I tried to take a picture of the rising sun, but I missed it both times I tried. The first time it disappeared behind a building; the second into the clouds. We wouldn&#8217;t see the sun again until we were in the air.<br />
While I was looking towards the back of the bus, trying to take that picture, I caught sight of Therese and Stuart sleeping on each other. Normally, it would have bothered me. For some reason, I knew it to be the right thing. For a few moments, I stared for no reason. Then I smiled inwardly, and returned to my view forward.<br />
After passing more hotels and fast food restaurants than an elephant could remember, we arrived in St. Petersburg, in more than enough time to catch our plane. Dick maneuvered the bus like an expert (waiting for some yahoo to get out of our way), stopped and wished us safe passage as we disembarked. Then we unloaded our stuff from Dick&#8217;s bus for the last time. I think I cried.<br />
Dumping our bags on the curb as instructed, we took the remainder of our stuff and did our best to line up in alphabetical order. We were told that this was the way we were going to receive our tickets (oh joy!), but it turned out that it was so they could easily check off our names at &#8220;check-in&#8221;. We basically showed them our passports and moved on.<br />
Instructed to meet at Gate 6 for 9:30, we moved on to do what we wanted until such time. Chris and I landed in a group of chairs and slacked off for a while. Chris was asked to take one of the seven trophies on as carry-on, and had to lug that around as well. Before long, we were watching most of the trophies and a motherlode of bags. The owners were upstairs eating breakfast. I was waiting for the in-flight, I didn&#8217;t want to break another traveler&#8217;s check.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
We made it, loads o&#8217; time to spare. Dick has told us that he&#8217;ll mount Stuart&#8217;s picture &amp; the signature sheet on his &#8220;I Love Me&#8221; wall. Now we get to wait about an hour for our friggin&#8217; flight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I&#8217;m tired, my brain has a nasty habit of not storing small details. That&#8217;s why it may seem that parts of this day may be moving faster than usual. Chris and I sat there for most of the time up to about 9:15, when people gave us our tickets. Chris and I wanted to sit together if it was possible, so Chris went back to Stothart to see if we could get our exchanged. While Chris was doing that, I collected our stuff (the only stuff left by that point) and brought it up to the gate, where Stothart was surrounded by a swarm of students.<br />
Chris emerged from the swarm, wielding our tickets home. Then he started down the hall to where we sat. Chris was tired, he hadn&#8217;t noticed that I had his stuff. After whistling him back, we got into line for the x-ray machine. Over the p.a., we could hear the airline calling our rows to board. Soon, we knew that final boarding call would be sounded.<br />
After dumping my crap on the conveyor, I passed through the metal detector (and for the first time in my life, didn&#8217;t set it off!) and await my stuff to come. Chris however, got nailed. He had to make a couple of passes through the contraption, each time having to take something else off. It was beginning to look more like a strip search. He finally passed through (I had picked up his stuff again) and were on our way out when Chris noticed that he didn&#8217;t have his jean jacket. I hadn&#8217;t realized that he had sent it through the x-ray machine too.<br />
Then we left the building. St. Petersburg / Clearwater is the birthplace of modern air travel (at least, according to the plaque they had near one of the doors), and had no terminal boarding, we had to get on from the tarmac. It was probably for the better, we got a last breath of Florida air. It was also my last picture.<br />
After climbing into our Canada 3000 757 aircraft, we found our seats, took the barf bags, and prepared for the flight out. I considered sleeping during the flight, but two and bit hours isn&#8217;t worth it. At about 10:00 (give or take ten minutes), the hatches were closed and the engines brought up to speed. This interrupted the safety speech (darn!) for a few moments, but then we were on a roll.<br />
A few minutes later, we hit the airways for home. Jess was seated with Chris and I, on the window side, Chris between us. Jess was deeply engrossed in her homework, I was engrossed in the in-flight movie&#8230; until I found out what it was. &#8220;Three Men And A Little Lady&#8221; is something I can&#8217;t take before 18:00, it won&#8217;t settle with my stomach, though there are a few funny parts.<br />
Within moments of the film starting, the trolley of drinks came around. Because it wasn&#8217;t a breakfast flight, we also got those teeny bags of nuts. I want to know who the moron is who designed those little packages. I can almost inhale the contents there&#8217;s so little. How &#8217;bout a small ziplock bag eh? That would be a little more like it!<br />
Anyway, the nuts and the beverage went quickly. Next to come was lunch. Jess, being a vegetarian, was asked to identify herself so that she wouldn&#8217;t get one of the normal lunches, and would receive and vegetarian-approved meal. After seeing hers, I was glad to be an omnivore.<br />
We omnivores had a chicken-something dish with pasta salad, carrots, rice, a bun and a cheesecake dessert (which I donated to Chris as I rather dislike cheesecake). By the time I was done, there wasn&#8217;t a lot left on my tray. When I&#8217;m hungry, I&#8217;ll eat most airplane food given to me. I can&#8217;t understand why some people hate airplane food. I think it&#8217;s rather well made, and in general, Canadian airlines have good meals (though I&#8217;m told USAir also has good meals, my previous experience with them has told me otherwise).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong><br />
We&#8217;re now on our friggin&#8217; flight, headed for home. Unlike the in-flight movie on the way down (which was Home Alone), I&#8217;m not going to even bother with this one (aside from the commercial clip scenes).Lunch was tasty, I can&#8217;t understand why people say airplane food is tasteless. I rather like it myself. Mind you, it&#8217;s probably full of MSG.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Once my tray was removed, I leaned my chair back and drifted into the tunes from my walkman. I became so relaxed, time blitzed right by me. I might have even fallen asleep. Before I knew it, Chris was jarring me awake, taking my earphone plug and putting it into the airplane&#8217;s jack in the armrest. It was Paul Simon&#8217;s &#8220;Obvious Child&#8221; from &#8220;Rhythm Of The Saints&#8221;. I love that song, so I tried to sing it in my head. Then I remembered that Therese still had my CD of &#8220;Rhythm Of The Saints&#8221;, not to mention my alarm clock. I made a mental note to get them back,<br />
Pressure in my ears led me to believe that we were descending, meaning we weren&#8217;t far off from Toronto, from home. In the back of my head, I began to play one of Phil Collins&#8217; greatest hits, Take Me Home. Ever since the Soviet Union trip in the summer of 1989, I always think of the song when I return home.<br />
The plane banked and passed over Toronto out towards Pickering. Then the plane banked again, turning back towards Toronto. We got lower and lower, the flaps extended fully on the wings. People soon became visible as individuals; the wheels lowered and the rushing air roared in the compartments below us. We shot over the 427 and Airport Road, over to the runway. The wheels finally hit, we were bounced a fair bit, but we were down.<br />
Ten minutes later, we arrived at our Terminal One docking bay, and prepared to disembark. Because we were so far back in the plane, we knew that it was going to be some time before we got off. I didn&#8217;t realize just how slow. But soon, the line began to move, the three of us rose to take our positions in line, butting just in front of Bird and Crewe (not my fault if they take too long).<br />
Then came the maze of stairs and hallways that eventually got us to Immigration and Customs Canada. There were only two lines open when we got there, but a third opened quickly. I immediately rushed over to the new line so I could get through and get our bags. Chris was not so expedient and was a bit further back. I told him that I would retrieve his.<br />
Ahead of me, I heard the clerk as the person ahead of me what they had bought, and mentioned receipts. My heart stopped a moment. I had receipts for some of the stuff, but it would add up to over the limit I was allowed (yeah, I smuggled stuff in &#8211; name someone who didn&#8217;t). When my turn came, I had an excuse. When I was asked the question, I spilled my guts (excuse only), and got passed through.<br />
Next was baggage claim. Stuart and Therese had already snagged Chris&#8217; and my bags (how nice of them!), I plopped them both on the cart I had taken from the rack. We were now waiting for all the instruments to come out, so we could collect them and pass through to the outside.<br />
In the meantime, I made a collect phone call (phoning out of Pearson is long distance, yet phoning in isn&#8217;t &#8211; go figure!) to home to let my parents know that we were alive and the plane hadn&#8217;t been blown up by terrorists. Oh yeah, and to get a lift home. At first I thought we would only be about two hours, but I was wrong.<br />
After we had finally received all the pieces once more, we carted them outside, to Canada as we knew it. The swarm of us hovered there for a while until we were told to take all the stuff to the loading area outside of the building. Like willing slaves, we followed orders.<br />
Before long, the line of luggage and instruments had taken up most of the island in the middle of the pick-up road. We were waiting for two buses and a truck to carry our luggage and instruments. A half hour passed without show, and I made another call to home, setting pick-up back about an hour.<br />
Ten minutes or so after that, the truck and buses appeared from out of the blue. Loading began almost instantly. When the truck had been about three-quarters filled, those who weren&#8217;t loading were told to get on the buses for head count. By that time, it was a case of &#8220;the sooner we get home, the better!&#8221;<br />
The buses revved up, and moved out. After stopping to replace the antennae on the buses (they smash the overhead lights when they&#8217;re on), we hit the highway. It didn&#8217;t take long to lose the truck, which couldn&#8217;t go very fast because of the delicate cargo. Forty-five minutes passed before we saw the familiar sights of home, and school. None of us could take off as of yet though, we had to unload the truck first.<br />
Most of the parents were already there. Therese&#8217;s parents were happy to see her and Danica, as Stuart&#8217;s parents were glad to see Stuart. Then the two families began talking. I watched from a distance, and tried to think of what they&#8217;d be taking about. That&#8217;s when I learned that I shouldn&#8217;t think of those kinds of things when I&#8217;m tired&#8230; I got depressed again.<br />
It only took ten minutes to get all the instruments off the bus and back to their positions in the music room. My parents had arrived by then, Chris and I wasted no time in leaving. Naturally, we were hit with several questions dealing with out activities in the past five days, and we answered as best we could.<br />
My parents pulled into our driveway, where they got out. I took the keys, and drove Chris home. When we pulled into Chris&#8217; driveway a few minutes later, his father was waiting on the front porch.<br />
&#8220;I hate to disappoint you, but I brought him home!&#8221;<br />
Chris and I talked for a few more minutes, and discussed what we would do for the remainder of the day. I was hoping to get some sleep, and I really needed a shower. But first I wanted to get home. So I bid Chris farewell until school the next day, and returned to my humble abode.<br />
After relieving myself, I began to unpack. That only took fifteen minutes (almost as long as it took me to get it all in there!). I was happy to see that my parents hadn&#8217;t tried clean my room in my absence, it was exactly as I had left it&#8230; in a state of perfect disorganization. Yessir, I was home again.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t go to sleep. I wish I had, I might have even beat Kathryn&#8217;s record of fourteen hours of sleep. Instead, I began to write this story, so I wouldn&#8217;t forget it easily. I did have that shower too, which made me feel a lot better. I watched a little tv, cleaned out the fridge (I was a bit peckish) and checked on my bike (I had sent it in to be fixed &#8211; too expensive for me so I found).<br />
I went to bed early that night, the week&#8217;s events had completely worn me out. As I lay there in my own bed, staring at a dark ceiling, I thought of all that we had done in the past week. And I thought: &#8220;Was it worth the $714?&#8221; I could only come up with one answer&#8230;<br />
Every damn cent of it!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Final Supplemental</strong><br />
I haven&#8217;t done any of my homework, I&#8217;ve either been too busy or I just haven&#8217;t been bothered to do it. As for physics however, I ain&#8217;t luggin&#8217; a twenty pound text around Florida. The temp here is warm, comparable to that of Florida. It&#8217;s nice to be home, yet I still wish I was back in an area of Florida where the tourist population is low (i.e. Riviera Beach) for the next month. Tonight, we&#8217;re all going to sleep well, for tomorrow, we&#8217;re back in Hell!
