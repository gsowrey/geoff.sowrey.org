	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not since Kathryn returned to Toronto have I had some time off. I&#8217;ve been a busy little beaver, cutting down on the amount of work that&#8217;s been heaped on me in the past few weeks and months. So it goes without saying that one can get a little tired.<br />
I had planned to go in this weekend and try to work out more of the reports I&#8217;m working on. I came in early Saturday afternoon, and promptly accomplished nothing. Every word I typed, I erased. It was one of those days where nothing made sense, and every sentence only succeeded in detrimenting the entire report. A sure sign of exhaustion. So when Cory (my department head) suggested an evening out to relax, it seemed like a really good idea.<br />
Four of us from Web Development (Cory, Dennis, Shawn, and yours truly) along with one Designer (Neil, who regularly hangs out with Dennis and Shawn) found our way down to Chinook Bowling. Neil drove, which was a little odd, since it was almost impossible to see out Neil&#8217;s windows (they were a little foggy and dirty), and he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure of where the alley was. He kept saying that it was a bit of an &#8220;odd&#8221; door, but that he&#8217;d recognize it &#8212; a key thing because (according to Neil), there was no sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found the door.<br />
Right under a large red sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found, a bit to our chagrin, that we&#8217;d walked into a five-pin bowlerama, instead of the 10-pin, which I think we&#8217;d actually been hoping for. I don&#8217;t think we cared too much. Sure, some consider five-pin to be a retarded way to play &#8230; but they don&#8217;t play it the way we did.<br />
I should quickly detail the setting. Like most mall bowling alleys, it was in a basement. Built in the late 60s, it had received some more recent technology (computerized scoring, new lighting), but it was otherwise unchanged since it opened &#8230; including the shoes. (They are, I think, the worst shoes I&#8217;ve ever had to use. Which of course makes the experience all that much better.) The alley was packed with people, though I&#8217;m pretty sure we were among the oldest there. Certainly we were one of a small handful who had beer.<br />
Only moments after arriving, Cory&#8217;s name was called, indicating that a lane was now open. We hurried on with our shoes and headed directly for the awaiting lane. Our names were already entered into the computer system, appearing on the monitor above our lane. The five lonely pins glowed a purply tinge way off in the distance.<br />
Glowed? Oh yeah, missed that detail &#8212; it was glow in the dark bowling. Although the only thing that really glowed were the pins. The balls were they typical mottled black spheres. It&#8217;s probably a good thing they didn&#8217;t glow &#8212; if the staff had seen what we were doing with them, we&#8217;d have been kicked out before the end of the first game.<br />
I can actually remember the last time I went bowling &#8212; 5 December 1999 (see [[How to Throw a Surprise Party]]). My ex&#8217;s birthday. I had thrown her a surprise party (which had nearly given me an ulcer from the stress), and it had ultimately ended up in the Commodore Lanes. No glow bowl, though.<br />
I&#8217;ve noticed two things about my bowling ability. First, it seems to get better after a beer or two (although more than that has a severely inverse affect). Second, and this is the really bizarre one, I bowl better in the dark. I&#8217;ll never figure that one out&#8230;<br />
It took only a frame before Neil decided that our names weren&#8217;t right. So he took the liberty of changing them, usually when that particular person was up to roll. We went through many name changes, but I cannot really tell you what the final names we ended up with were. Not because I don&#8217;t remember (because I do), and not because they used objectionable words (otherwise we certainly would have been kicked out), but because the terms are &#8230; well &#8230; they carry certain meanings which I&#8217;d prefer not to have to explain.<br />
Not to mention that I don&#8217;t entirely understand them myself.<br />
My first game was off to a slow start (they usually do). But after a few throws, I began to remember how to throw a five-pin ball, and managed to sneak out in front by the time the round was over. The second game went completely to pot, and everyone but Cory and myself were trying new and unusual (and probably illegal in a few states) throws. For example, both Dennis and Shawn tried to throw the balls like you would in a baseball or softball game, though making sure that the ball didn&#8217;t bounce too hard. Dennis&#8217; most profound shot went directly into the gutter, but then ricocheted out, and managed to knock down the right two pins. For a couple of throws, Neil didn&#8217;t even get out of his chair, but opted to throw the ball from the bench. His accuracy wasn&#8217;t too bad, admittedly. I managed to win that round too, with a pitiful 165.<br />
Cory suggested that we attempt to get serious for our third game, but it&#8217;s hard to be serious when you have a hard time walking in a straight line. My game utterly fell apart, and was barely able to cross 100. I might have done better had we not run out of time on the game &#8230; and if the lights hadn&#8217;t come back on. Once I was able to see where I was throwing, my aim went totally off. Go figure. Cory won with a 188.<br />
Opting to leave the alley (being the only ones left, our rather unusual bowling styles were attracting a lot of attention), we headed over to Kensington for a post-game snack, and to discuss the future of our newly-formed bowling team &#8212; The Steamers (and no, I&#8217;m not telling you the full name). Neil, Dennis, and I made light of our short journey by singing Wayne Newton&#8217;s &#8220;Danke Schoen&#8221; at the top of our lungs, particularly when we managed to pull  up next to Cory&#8217;s truck. You can only imagine what it must have been like to have three mildly inebriated 20-somethings (barely) harmonizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recall Central Park in fall,<br />
how you tore your dress,<br />
what a mess,<br />
I confess&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I paid for it the following morning, and most of day. But you&#8217;d be surprised how much a good bout of dim sum can take the edge off a hangover (albeit a mild one). Even then, though, I didn&#8217;t feel decent until around 6pm that night, when the Academy Awards hit the airwaves.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably wondering what I thought of them. (And even if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m telling you anyway.) This was a tough year for the Academy. Lots of really crappy movies means that only a handful are good enough to even consider, which means that the criteria between all the movies isn&#8217;t easy. Okay, so let&#8217;s look at the ones I had problems with (you can assume I agreed with the rest):<br />
Best Supporting Actor: Benicio Del Toro (Traffic)<br />
Okay, this isn&#8217;t so much a problem as I wanted Willem Dafoe to win for Shadow of the Vampire. Although the movie itself wasn&#8217;t worth nominating, his performance saved it from being a waste of celluloid. Were it up to me, I would have picked Dafoe.<br />
Best Actress: Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich)<br />
Yes, she&#8217;s attractive. Yes, she can act a million times better than her brother, Eric. But did she really deserve it? Well, there&#8217;s the $30 million dollar question (which is, ironically enough, probably what she&#8217;s gonna start asking for). Now, admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen Erin Brockovich, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a good movie. (I&#8217;ve seen enough clips.) However, this is Julia Roberts we&#8217;re talking about. Both Chris and I have extreme reservations when it comes to her winning over performances such as Ellen Burstyn (Requiem For A Dream) who was utterly astounding, or even Bjork (Dancer In The Dark), who wasn&#8217;t even nominated for an Oscar! So why did Julia win? It was &#8220;her year&#8221;. She&#8217;s paid her dues, regardless of the talent of others. (Yeah, I sound a little bitter. I&#8217;m annoyed that the Academy still seems to work this way.)<br />
Best Actor: Russell Crowe (Gladiator)<br />
Okay, yes, he did an excellent performance, and he is a good actor. But I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it was all the lobbying that got him the award. I&#8217;ve heard amazing reviews of Ed Harris&#8217; performance in Pollock, which to me looks more worthy. Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen it, so this is mostly just me wondering about Hollywood. Not so much as with Best Picture, though.<br />
Best Director: Steven Soderbergh (Traffic)<br />
Steve&#8217;s a good director, I&#8217;ll give him that. And certainly with two nominations, he certainly upped his chances. But when you look at Traffic and compare it with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I&#8217;m gonna abbreviate it to CTHD, &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s a lot to type), there isn&#8217;t much of a contest. The goal of a director is to provide the coordination and overall feeling for the movie. I&#8217;m sure Steve had a lot to do with that. But two things: 1) Traffic was based on a British series of the same name, so ol&#8217; Stevie had something existing to work with. 2) When it comes to having to manage sheer complexity, and being an utter nit-pick to get the scene just right, you can&#8217;t beat the tenacity that Ang Lee showed. (I know, because I read about it.) So yeah, I don&#8217;t agree with this one.<br />
Best Picture: Gladiator<br />
Wow. What a surprise. I think Chris and I both knew that Hollywood still wasn&#8217;t quite ready to choose a movie like CTHD as its best of the year. Disappointing in a way &#8212; CTHD embodied most of what movie-making has tried to create. That&#8217;s not to reduce Gladiator&#8217;s success even in the slightest &#8212; it, too, did an excellent job. But with both Life Is Beautiful and CTHD being nominated for Best Picture awards, maybe the future holds a more global view than the typical American fare.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life is abdunant with difficult experiences. Some come from education, some from your job, some from a close relationship with a potential life partner. But there are few experiences that are as hard as saying goodbye to good friends.<br />
Critical Mass is opening an office in Toronto. Its first day of business is Monday the 19th. We&#8217;re staffing it with some people who were hired and brought here, and with some who were here and want to go back east. Tonight, Critical Mass said a fond farewell to 23 of its own, as they prepare to embark on a journey to the centre of the Universe (otherwise known as Toronto) and open our new office.<br />
It could have been more emotional, I suppose, but that&#8217;s probably why there was free alcohol, to keep us placated. (In retrospect, not a bad thing.) But it still didn&#8217;t dull the pain of seeing people leave. I know most of the people who are going, either by working with them or being on the same team.<br />
Today I said goodbye to three good friends: Dave, Mike, and Jen.<br />
Dave was the one who interviewed me when I first walked through Critical Mass&#8217; doors just over a year ago. I remember the interview well, thinking I was in a lot of trouble because I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he wanted. Dave&#8217;s got a good poker face. It wasn&#8217;t until we struck upon movies that he seemed to lighten up. Not a month later, I was seated a desk away from Dave, and since then have been fortunate to know Dave quite well. We spent several very long days and nights during the summer working on our respective projects, often staying until the wee hours of the morning alternating between coding and acting goofy.<br />
Mike was also in my department, but because he sat in a different area, I really didn&#8217;t get to know him until a couple of months after I got here. Mike&#8217;s wit and passion for independent films was what set him apart from most people, as did his fascination (some call it obsession) with strange video games like &#8220;Samba De Amigo&#8221;.<br />
I first met Jen on the night before we were to deliver a pitch for a potential client. She and Chris had been engaged in heavy conversation when I arrived. We found that she shared the same birthday as Chris and I, which created some sort of strange bond between the three of us. Jen and I have since seen a couple of Tuesday night movies (&#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolat&#8221;) and had a few deep conversations of our own. I&#8217;ve known Jen for only just over four months, but it feels like it&#8217;s been much longer.<br />
I&#8217;ve been preparing for this day for a long time, but it seems so surreal to have it finally arrive. Not an hour ago, I watched Dave and Mike drive away into the night, knowing that there would be no more game nights with them, no more breakfasts or lunches, no more movies. Soon, I will say goodbye to Jen, and she, too, will disappear into the night. No more deep conversations over pints of Guinness about movies or strange things that have happened in our lives.<br />
They&#8217;re still a part of Critical Mass, but they might as well have moved to the other side of the world for all it really matters. They&#8217;re not here.<br />
Last night, I went out with Dave for his second-to-last night in Calgary. I drank more than I would normally, probably to dull the pain. Tonight, I found myself doing the same again. Were I more sober, I would realise how much it hurts. I did my best to laugh and joke as Dave and Mike drove away, all the time feeling my insides twisting up into a single tight knot.<br />
Tomorrow, I will come to work, and see three empty desks where my friends used to sit. I&#8217;ll see their ghosts for days, maybe even weeks to come. Sure, there will always be email, but it&#8217;s never quite the same as being with them. This I know from experience.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to good friends.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One year and one day ago, I did the hardest thing I&#8217;d ever done in my life: I said goodbye to Vancouver, to Radical Entertainment, and my friends. I then started a new life.<br />
Last year, I spent a month living in a city that I&#8217;d only been to three times before. I had two things in my favour: 1) I was living with family (my Aunt, Uncle, and cousin), and 2) I had time to myself to think, contemplate, and rebuild.<br />
It&#8217;s been 12 months since I arrived here. I look back at what I used to be, who I used to be, and I&#8217;m pleased that I bid farewell to that person &#8230; to that life. It was a dead-end for me, one of mental hardship and emotional strife. It&#8217;s something no-one should have to experience willingly.<br />
But I would be lying if I said I got here alone. Very few things can be done in life without help from others, and rarely does that help come without request. I had lots of help and support. From Joel, who helped me pack up my belongings; from Greg, who not only packed, but help me drive to Calgary; from my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, and cousin Jen, who made me feel welcome in their home and provided me with the shelter I needed to restart; from all of my friends, near and far, who supported me in my decision; from my family, whose concern kept me going; and most of all from my sister Cathy, who became my pillar of strength in my hour of greatest need.<br />
Basically, if you&#8217;re reading this, you have contributed, even in some small way, to who I am. Even if all you did was send me an email joke, it was enough to brighten a day. To all of you, I say &#8220;Thanks&#8221;.<br />
I suppose I should go out and celebrate, rejoice in the freedom and happiness I enjoy. But it wouldn&#8217;t change much &#8212; I celebrate each and every moment, each and every friend and family member.<br />
May the years to come bring you as much happiness.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s amazing how old friends can make you feel young.<br />
A week and four days ago, Kathryn, one of our closest friends, came out to visit us (Chris, Stuart, Therese, and myself). The five of us all went to OTHS, and though we might have graduated different years, we&#8217;ve still been fast friends, and have kept contact over the years.<br />
Kathryn, like most of my closest friends, is an artist &#8230; specifically, the theatre arts. She&#8217;s a stage manager. Stage managers are responsible for making sure that a production goes off without a hitch. If it happens on, above, behind, below, in front, or off stage, it&#8217;s the Stage Manager who make sure it happens when it&#8217;s supposed to happen. It&#8217;s a hard job, and not everyone can do it. Kathryn lives for it.<br />
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also not easy to get work &#8230; especially if you&#8217;re trying to break into the Toronto scene, which Kathryn is. She&#8217;s worked for years around Eastern Ontario, but getting work in Toronto is very difficult when you&#8217;re not there to get it. This is how Kathryn ended up with two months with nothing to do. This is also how Kathryn got the time to come out for a visit.<br />
Given, Alberta&#8217;s not the most inviting place in the middle of February &#8230; Mexico seems to be the popular destination this year for Albertans &#8230; but there are the few diehard skiers that make their way out here (despite the worst skiing conditions in years). And at least one person who came to see us, and what else was in our otherwise barren and snow-covered province.<br />
I took a few days off, partly because I needed to (you have no idea how bad I actually needed a vacation), and partly so I wouldn&#8217;t feel like we invited someone out only to ignore them. This, in retrospect, was probably the wisest thing I did. I had no idea how badly I actually needed to take a break. Yeah, I know, I went home for Christmas &#8230; but still, I needed the break.<br />
Kathryn came to Calgary on 15 February. I got up early that morning to finish cleaning up a bit: Vacuumed, cleaned the kitchen, wiped the floors, did a quick load of laundry, and bought a small vase of flowers for the night table (my room is a little spartan &#8212; I thought it could use a little colour and fragrance). I arrived at the airport about five minutes before Kathryn&#8217;s plane was to land. Figures that when I&#8217;m running a little late, so is Kathryn&#8217;s flight. She arrived about 45 minutes later, and was quite happy not only to be on terra firma, but in Calgary &#8212; she&#8217;d never been here before.<br />
Soon we arrived at our apartment, where I introduced Kathryn to her temporary home from home, and our roommate, Miao Yin. That was when I realized I&#8217;m either a really good listener, or psychic. Kathryn, who grew up with two cats, has sadly become allergic to them. As such, I had made sure that my bedroom (which was where Kathryn would sleep) was Miao Yin-free, not an easy task, let me tell you. &#8220;Curiosity killed the cat&#8221; isn&#8217;t just some quaint saying.<br />
Plopping on one of the couches, we talked for about three or so hours, when Chris finally came home. We ordered out for dinner that night, not wanting to get off to too fast a start &#8230; and not having a lot of food in the apartment worth cooking. Besides, Kathryn was dying to have Chinese served in one of those fancy paper boxes.<br />
When bedtime finally arrived, Kathryn retired to my room. She was a little dismayed at first that I was giving up my bed, but Chris and I will quite willingly offer our beds to our guests. So yes, I can safely say that I had a beautiful woman sleep in my bed for a week&#8230;<br />
&#8230;but I slept on the couch.<br />
(It&#8217;s not that bad. Our couches may be ugly as sin, but they&#8217;re quite comfy.)<br />
The next day, I Kathryn got a walking tour of downtown Calgary &#8230; from inside. The original plan had been to walk down 8th Ave to Theatre Calgary. However, the weather decided that it would disagree, and nearly froze us to death. We went into the +15 for comfort.<br />
The +15, for those of you who&#8217;ve never of it, is an above-ground series of walkways, not unlike Toronto&#8217;s underground PATH system. Same principle, same contents, just 30 feet in the opposite direction. A movie was made about it recently, called &#8220;Waydowntown&#8221;. Kathryn thought it was quite funny. I&#8217;ll have to see it sometime.<br />
We wound our way from the Husky building, through the parking garage (which is enclosed), through Penny Lane, and into the Eaton Centre, through the TD Centre, Home Oil Building, and ultimately into The Bay, where the trail ended. Then we braved the frigid outdoors to cross the street and duck into A&amp;B Sound. Kathryn wanted to see was the prices were like, and hey, it never hurts to go into a music store.<br />
Kathryn came out with nothing. I didn&#8217;t fare that lucky&#8230; (Enough with the snickering!) As we were trying to hunt down Great Big Sea&#8217;s &#8220;Play&#8221; album for Kathryn (hers had been snitched), she remembered some music I had to listen to: Afro-Celt Sound System. I&#8217;d never heard of them before, but I&#8217;m quite willing to take my friends&#8217; advice (especially those who share musical tastes) and go out on a limb. Both albums are great!<br />
Ducking out of A&amp;B Sound, we braved the cold for a couple of blocks until we got to Theatre Calgary. Calgary is a strange city. Most cities have theatre areas &#8230; Calgary has a theatre block. The whole block. A BIG block. There&#8217;s a concert hall, and six or seven theatres crammed into one space. Makes a night out easy to find, I&#8217;ll say&#8230;<br />
Kathryn is a theatre junkie, which makes sense, given her chosen profession. She wanted to see what else was playing, and if it was possible to see anything. Of the available plays, none really fell into a schedule that seemed to fit with anything. The only really interesting one was &#8220;The Vagina Monologues&#8221;, which is (from what I&#8217;ve heard) very good. Unfortunately, I could not find out if it was possible to get tickets in advance (all I got was a hard-to-understand answering machine).<br />
Leaving Theatre Calgary (toting a large number of pamphlets for theatre information), we walked the three blocks to Critical Mass. No, I was not going to work. I was taking Kathryn on a tour, after which we were going to meet up with Chris for lunch. It wasn&#8217;t an easy tour &#8212; I was trying not to be spotted and dragged into a discussion that, really, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.<br />
After distracting Chris from his work for about an hour and a half, Kathryn and I headed out for more exploration. Again, Calgary&#8217;s biting wind chased us indoors. This seemed like a good time to see how far we could walk in the +15. Although we had to go outside for a short while (the +15 has a few orphaned sections, due to the rapid pace of construction in downtown Calgary), we eventually found our way to the Sheraton Hotel, across the street from Eau Claire Market.<br />
Among many things, Kathryn was looking for gifts for friends of hers whose birthdays were fast approaching. While we found nothing for them, Kathryn was overjoyed to find a store that sold British chocolates. We also purchased four bottles of wine (not to be drunk all at one time).<br />
The walk back took us to within one block of our apartment, all indoors. After dumping our wares, we made a hasty visit to the Safeway to get groceries for dinner. I was going to attempt my first curry in months, and Kathryn was promising to make us chilli one night.<br />
We spent another (reasonably) quiet night in, watching TV and talking amongst ourselves. My curry was a bit of a disaster (although I was immensely happy that the rice turned out beautifully) &#8212; I&#8217;m out of practice. I need to make it a bit more frequently.<br />
Saturday was a bit of write-off as far as tourism goes. In preparation for Kathryn&#8217;s visit, I got my car tuned up and repaired &#8230; to the tune of almost $1,600. I won&#8217;t go into detail of what needed fixing, but suffice to say, it was stuff that I should have had looked at two years ago. (Unfortunately for me, at the time I had someone telling me that I was better off selling the car than getting it fixed.) It runs like a dream now &#8212; probably better than when I first got it. However, there had been one little problem &#8212; the brakes had given out a couple of days after I got the car back. I had the brakes fixed again (gratis, luckily), but I had been told to bring the car back for a double-check after I&#8217;d driven it a while. This was the first day I had the chance.<br />
So Kathryn put up with a 2-hour wait for the 10-minute inspection. I felt really bad, because she had flown 3,000 kilometres to wander around a mall and wait for something that I should&#8217;ve done before she arrived.<br />
During this time, we raided the nearby Costco for snack food and pop (Chris had invited people over for that evening). Normally, we drive to Costco. Anyone with an ounce of sense would drive to the Costco. Except me, of course. Figuring we had time to kill anyway, we went over to Costco and picked up two flats of pop and some frozen snacks. That was the easy part. The hard part was the walk back to the car. With two armfuls of pop and frozen food. Believe me, that stuff ain&#8217;t light. If we hadn&#8217;t stumbled across an abandoned shopping cart on our return trip, I don&#8217;t think my arms would&#8217;ve survived.<br />
The car not having yet moved, we retreated into the mall. This was fortunate on one account &#8212; the mall had a Payless Shoe store. And Kathryn needed a new pair of shoes. They had just what she was looking for.<br />
After wandering around for a short while, we stopped, had a drink &#8212; a mochaccino for Kathryn, and a hot chocolate for me &#8212; and shared some conversation. Kathryn and I talked a lot. About almost everything. But a lot of it, at least at first, was about how each of us were doing. Kathryn&#8217;s busy schedule only gives us brief glimpses into her life through sporadic email messages. And there are a lot of things that just don&#8217;t seem to make it into these logs &#8212; sometimes because it might make people feel uncomfortable, and sometimes because I just plain forgot.<br />
Finally deciding that the car should be ready (they hadn&#8217;t called me), we returned to the garage to pick it up. All was well, and we were on our way. Not long after getting back, our first guest arrived &#8212; Adrian, one of our co-workers at Critical Mass. Adrian brought a unique twist to our evening, a device that I had not actively played with since the early 80s.<br />
An Atari 2600.<br />
Okay, I should mention something before I get too far ahead of myself. Chris and I hold &#8220;game nights&#8221; on a pseudo-regular basis. We own a Dreamcast. No, not the most recent gaming system, but one that was relatively inexpensive, and has a lot of really good games available. (Not to mention that we found a good place to get games &#8230; uh &#8230; cheap, so our initial library was pretty decent.) We invite a group of people we know to be gamers, and we go nuts for upwards of six hours, beating each other into virtual pulps. Our neighbours must wonder what the hell goes on in our apartment. It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ve got nice, thick, concrete walls.<br />
Anyway, back to the Atari. I hadn&#8217;t played one of these since I was a kid. But the old graphics, the sounds, and the action came back fast. The four of us got into the games very quickly. It was a lot of fun. I had originally been apprehensive that Kathryn would spend a third boring night in, made worse by watching a bunch of guys scream and yell over video games. For the record, Kathryn was utterly enthralled with the Atari &#8212; she remembered it well.<br />
Several people had arrived by the time Kathryn and I left. We were going to the Calgary Tower, Kathryn&#8217;s first real touristy activity. She wanted to see a sunset over the mountains, and this is about as good a place to see it as any. Not to mention, it&#8217;s a nice view of the entire city.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d been up Calgary Tower was in August of 1997, when Gerry and I blindly wandered around downtown Calgary trying to figure out what there was to see. I can still remember not knowing what we were looking at or where we were going. Today it all seems to simple&#8230;<br />
For those of you who have never experienced it, a sunset from Calgary Tower, especially on a clear day, it really quite something to behold. It attracts a bit of a crowd, too, for obvious reasons. We circled the tower a few times (which doesn&#8217;t take long &#8212; it&#8217;s not that big), and I pointed out some of the more significant landmarks. Kathryn sighed in excitement &#8212; she wanted to go to the mountains badly. That was a promise for Monday.<br />
About 10 minutes after sunset, we returned to street level, and headed back to the apartment. More people had arrived, and the Atari had been replaced with the Dreamcast &#8212; and tennis. Yeah, tennis. Not the most riveting of games &#8230; or so you&#8217;d think. In reality, this was probably one of the most popular games to hit it big in our game nights in quite a while. People were yelling and screaming, the trash talk flew, and as people got more practice, the games got more intense. Kathryn got complete into the insanity, and even started hamming it up with Dave (another co-worker), giving names to all the characters on screen. Even Stuart showed up for his first game night, and was immediately sucked into the mayhem.<br />
Things only got worse with Samba De Amigo. This is one of those really bizarre Japanese games that periodically make to North America. It&#8217;s a musical game &#8212; the graphics are almost irrelevant &#8212; that you play with &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; maracas.<br />
No, I&#8217;m not making this up.<br />
You plug in a pair of maracas. There are sensors that figure out where they&#8217;re being held, and there are accelerometers in the balls to detect when (and how hard) you shake them. This is basically the only game they&#8217;re used for, and to put it mildly, the game is just plain nuts. It was quite popular &#8230; after the initial shock wore off, anyway.<br />
Sunday morning was dim sum morning. This is a near-ritual for some of us, making our way down to Chinatown and bulking up on bite-size morsels of Oriental goodness. We met up with Stuart, Therese, and Janine, and couldn&#8217;t wait to get to a table and start the feast.<br />
After dim sum, Janine took off with friends, leaving the five of us to our post-dim sum ritual &#8230; shopping. Normally we go to the mall downtown, but periodically, we venture down to Chinook Centre, the best mall in town. We toured in and out of a few stores, looking at interesting things, but not really biting at the offered wares. The only real purchases came at Black&#8217;s Camera, where Therese and Kathryn took the opportunity to stock up on film.<br />
We headed back downtown, in search of activities to keep us occupied for the remainder of the afternoon. Kathryn suggested we stop in at the Glenbow Museum, and see what there was to see. That was when we found out about the Glenbow&#8217;s peculiar sales habits &#8212; they sell only a limited number of tickets for the day. When we got there, they were sold out. As you can imagine, that had us quite confused &#8212; it&#8217;s a museum, not a concert! But the Glenbow limits the tickets so all their visitors will receive an enjoyable experience, rather than packing the place full.<br />
We ended up retreating to our apartment, to strike up a brief game of tennis. Therese and Stuart stuck around that evening, and the five of us spent a lazy Sunday night having dinner, talking, and watching the Sunday night line-up.<br />
Monday was Family Day in Alberta, an odd statutory holiday cooked up (assumedly) for the auspices of getting more skiing in during the winter. In any case, Chris and I both had the day off (Stuart&#8217;s company defers the day to later in the year, and Therese just needed to get work done without anyone bugging her) and so took Kathryn into the Canadian Rockies.<br />
The morning was grey &#8230; well, actually white. It wasn&#8217;t snowing, but the sky looked like someone had accidentally bleached the blue out. I was a bit apprehensive about going &#8212; I really wanted Kathryn to experience Banff on a nice day &#8212; but she insisted that it was worth the risk. I guess after stalling for four days, she was ready to go, no matter what the weather was like.<br />
After a quick run to my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s to borrow their park pass, we headed towards the mountains. Normally, you can see the mountains as soon as you clear Calgary city limits (which happen to be at the top of a hill which blocks the view of the mountains), but the weather was so bleak that we couldn&#8217;t see anything until we were within 20 kilometres.<br />
Luckily for us, the weather started clear within a few minutes of arriving in Banff, just as the Weather Channel had predicted. By the time we climbed out of the car, blue sky was clearly visible. An hour later, we had to wear sunglasses as not to be blinded.<br />
Our first stop was at the Cave and Basin (yeah, I know it&#8217;s becoming a habit). Unlike previous tours, we didn&#8217;t actually go into the cave, but walked around on the outside. Then it was over to the new(er) hot springs on the east side of Sulphur Mountain. Kathryn was utter giddy with delight from all the vistas that she could see. Then it was down to the Bow Falls below the Banff Springs Hotel, and then to the hotel itself.<br />
The hotel&#8217;s changed since I was last there with Cathy and Craig. Back then, you entered the hotel through the &#8220;rear&#8221; of the hotel. At the time, the hotel was adding a new entrance on the &#8220;front&#8221;. That construction is now complete, and you can no longer enter the old way. The new entrance is much more impressive, though.<br />
In what looks like an effort to spruce up the appearance of the hotel, CP Hotels is changing the ethos of the old place, and making it into a castle. The new entrance is a Great Hall, complete with grey stone work, long corridors with austere appearances, and new staircases and wall faces that resemble something out of a dark ages keep. Unfortunately, it also meant that all the restaurants were closed for the renovation &#8230; lunch was out that day.<br />
We stopped again just on the north side of the Banff Street bridge, so Kathryn could get a good picture looking through the downtown, towards Cascade Mountain (which she absolutely fell in love with). This was our base for wandering around town for the next hour or so. We wandered up Banff Street to the Visitor&#8217;s Information Centre (which I had last visited some three and a half years ago with Gerry), then across the street for a quick drink at a nearby Second Cup, then by the fudge shop, and finally back to the car.<br />
Then it was off to Lake Louise. It had been an off-the-cuff suggestion, and everyone seemed game. We got there about 30 minutes before sunset (sunset at Lake Louise, that is &#8212; the sun wouldn&#8217;t set for another hour or so), so had ample light to look around.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d seen the lake totally frozen. I had been there in late May once, and the lake had still been ice-covered, but this was so well frozen that people could hike all over its surface. Which is precisely what we ended up doing&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s quite an experience to hike to the middle of Lake Louise. You&#8217;re about a kilometre from anything. Mountains on three sides, and a itty-bitty little hotel on the fourth. (In the middle of the lake, the hotel is quite small.) Aside from a few other people, you&#8217;re alone. It&#8217;s quiet &#8212; no cars, no planes, nothing there to take away from the beauty of the land. The soft, white snow extends smoothly until it reaches the mountains, then gives way to an upthrust of white, beige, brown, red, and black. The sun casts stark shadows in the jagged rock, and it seems so odd because there&#8217;s absolutely no noise.<br />
Chris has recently started a search for his spirituality. It&#8217;s given the two of us many an occasion for deeply philosophical conversations. Kathryn had played devil&#8217;s advocate with Chris a couple nights earlier, not questioning why Chris was searching, but wanting to know his reasons. (The only real way to see someone&#8217;s thought processes is to ask them hard questions.) Kathryn had posed Chris a question: &#8220;What does God give you?&#8221; Chris has answered it adequately at the time. As the three of us stood in the middle of the lake, staring at sights that few people in the world could even imagine, he quietly said: &#8220;This is what God gives me.&#8221; There was no rebuttal.<br />
We walked about 9/10ths the length of the lake before turning back. The walk up wasn&#8217;t an easy one &#8212; the uneven path was hard-packed snow, barely a foot and a half wide by the time we turned around. We were regularly slipping off into the powdery surrounding snow. Chris trudged through the powder uneventfully, his boots and long underwear protecting him from the cold. The walk back was considerably easier, as the west side of the lake had a fairly wide area of packed snow.<br />
After a quick stop in the hotel to use the facilities, we hit the road for our trip back to Calgary. The sun set as we drove, and by the time we reached the city limits, it was dark. A little too dark. It looked like my headlights weren&#8217;t working. A quick stop at a gas station revealed that while light was being emitted by my headlights, all the dirt and salt from our day&#8217;s excursion had made the glass almost completely opaque. A quick wipe with a wet squeegee fixed that.<br />
The following day was cool and bright &#8212; the perfect day for spending a few hours buried in a museum. This time, Kathryn and I got tickets, and spent the day in glorious education at the Glenbow Museum. Kathryn, like myself, is a reader. Whereas Cathy and Craig might be able to blitz through the Royal Tyrell Museum in 30 minutes, Kathryn and I spent three and a half hours reading nearly every word on Asian art and sculpture (mostly revolving around Hindu and Buddhist artefacts) and on the Egyptian culture (courtesy of a travelling exhibit). We only managed to get through one floor before we had to stop. Our brains hurt from the information overload.<br />
On our way home, we stopped into a Second Cup for refreshments, and what ended up being a nice long conversation. It started out with me apologizing for being such a dullard. You&#8217;re probably wondering why I did that? Well, it&#8217;s not easy to explain. Chris and Kathryn have a much more animated conversational style, certainly one that looks more interesting and exciting than the one she has with me. With Chris, they laugh, exchange mock insults, and carry on in a more exuberant manner. With me, things are more &#8230; well, dull. I felt bad about that. I honestly felt like Kathryn was bored out of her mind being around me so much, because I&#8217;m such a dull person. (And yes, I have to admit that I&#8217;m dull. And if you disagree with me, I&#8217;ll point you to my dating history.)<br />
Kathryn was quick to object. (She is a good friend, after all.) She brought up an interesting point that I hadn&#8217;t really considered before. (Which is ironic, considering her point was something I&#8217;d noted many times since high school.) Kathryn is artistic &#8212; she sings, she acts, she works in theatre. Chris is artistic &#8212; he sings, he creates imagery, he&#8217;s an excellent photographer. I&#8217;m not artistic &#8212; I can&#8217;t sing to save my life, can&#8217;t even draw a good-looking stick person, can&#8217;t act my way out of a paper bag. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a geek. I&#8217;ve always been a geek &#8212; even when I was a little kid, I was a geek. I wanted to know how everything worked (which is why I went through a few portable cassette players before I figured that taking another apart didn&#8217;t serve any purpose).<br />
Kathryn called me &#8220;philosophical&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a general thing, or if that&#8217;s just because of the conversations I&#8217;d been having with her to that point (she&#8217;d asked me if I were a different person, and I&#8217;d ended up waxing poetic for about a half hour on my personal development over the past year). I suppose in a way I am philosophical &#8230; but I gotta tell ask, what woman would find that interesting? Again, I point you to my dating history&#8230;<br />
That evening, Kathryn and I make use of cheap Tuesday, and caught a showing of &#8220;O Brother, Where Are Thou?&#8221;, the Coen Brothers&#8217; latest cinematic outing. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie &#8212; it&#8217;s a great mythic romp through 1930&#8217;s southern United States. We didn&#8217;t find it nearly as funny as a guy a row or two back from us. Everyone&#8217;s seen or heard of the stereotypically loud-mouthed moron who finds something as trivial as a guy sneezing the funniest thing ever put on film. Well, that night we met one. I&#8217;m reasonably certain we weren&#8217;t the only ones in the theatre who wanted to gag and bind him for the duration of the movie. I feel sorry for the friends who go with him &#8230; assuming he has any.<br />
Wednesday was another educational trek through Alberta, this time to Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, about two hours south of Calgary. This is a location where, until 120 years (but starting over 5,500 years ago), Native tribes would drive herds of buffalo off a cliff. Head-Smashed-In is one of the best preserved, and due to the outstanding Interpretation Centre built nearby, has earned a place as a UNESCO site.<br />
It was Kathryn&#8217;s first visit to the Prairies. The drive down afforded her a constantly changing contrast of rolling hills, flat plains, and distant mountain vistas. (Not to mention a few oil well pumps.) Kathryn was so happy to be engaging in touristy activities that I sometimes wondered if I really needed to be there. (I&#8217;ve seen most of this stuff before, so I was only there as a pseudo tour guide.)<br />
We arrived at the Buffalo Jump just before noon. The first stop in the tour is along the ridge where buffalo used to plunge to their deaths. (Buffalo have very poor eyesight, and the Native tribes were able to exploit this deficiency under the right conditions.) It&#8217;s to introduce you to the site before you learn about it. Up there, you can&#8217;t hear a thing. It&#8217;s dead silent. Oppressively silent. It&#8217;s almost deafening. For city folk, it can be a bit unnerving. I find it hugely relaxing. We had a few moments of silence before we were bombarded by a small group of Native kids, who were assumedly on an excursion to learn about their heritage.<br />
We spent about three and a half hours at Head-Smashed-In, learning (and in my case, relearning) the history of the site, and the way of the peoples who use the site. I was glad I&#8217;d come &#8212; my knowledge had managed to distort a little since my last visit.<br />
We left for home around 3:30 in the afternoon. We made a brief stop in Fort MacLeod, about 5 minutes further south on Highway 2 so Kathryn could get a bite to eat. I was beginning to come down with a cold, and my appetite had vanished. But soon we were on our way back home.<br />
That night, Chris, Kathryn, and I went to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s apartment for dinner. It was like old times &#8212; really old times. We&#8217;ve all known each other for 10 years. We&#8217;d all gotten together at Christmas, but this was a little different. We were in a homey environment, without having to yell above the teeming masses. It was one of those times when you know that no matter what may come, we&#8217;ll still be friends when we&#8217;re all retired and living on some sandy shore in a non-extradition country with a low tax rate.<br />
My vacation ended Thursday morning, and it was time for me to go back to work. Kathryn left for Edmonton later that morning to visit with friends. This was a good thing &#8212; my suspected cold was turning into a nasty cold. I drugged myself up heavily and trudged into work to see what I could get done &#8230; and wade through the 100+ email I&#8217;d managed to accumulate in that time.<br />
The only productive thing I got done that day was finally launch Critical Mass&#8217;s new website (http://www.criticalmass.com/). This is what has been sucking up huge amounts of my time since early December. If it hadn&#8217;t been the wait to get client approval on some stuff, we&#8217;d have had it up a long time ago. But our website isn&#8217;t high on our clients&#8217; priorities.<br />
I like this site, and not just because I was the lead developer. I like it because we let the Design department try some interesting ideas that we&#8217;d never tried before. The result is a lot of DHTML animation that had me staring at the ceiling for a few collective days, trying to figure out ways of getting it to work. (Sounds kinda dumb, I know, but when you have to deal with several different browsers across two platforms, it&#8217;s more work than you think.)<br />
The launch complete, I bailed for home as my cold decided to take me down. I called in sick on Friday, the cold having taken me down completely. (I could have gone in, but I figured I&#8217;d get just as much work done at the office as I would sleeping at home.)<br />
Kathryn and her housemate Mareca (I hope that&#8217;s the correct spelling) returned to Calgary Saturday afternoon. Kathryn and Mareca have been friends for quite a while, so I understand, and are both in the theatre biz. Mareca&#8217;s a little older than Kathryn (having just turned 30 &#8212; though she&#8217;s far too cute to be 30, in my humble opinion), but has the energy of someone 10 years younger.<br />
Kathryn, Mareca, Mareca&#8217;s friend Karen, and I were going to a play that night. Mareca had a friend in the production who got us half-price tickets, and it seemed like fun. Besides, I&#8217;d never seen Camelot before. The show was quite good, though being a theatre novice (I&#8217;ve only seen a few productions), I was happier with the performance than the other three. They pulled it apart. But not half as bad as Bryce, who played Mordred.<br />
Bryce is an old friend of Mareca, and is an accomplished actor. He&#8217;s also got a great singing voice (I still have &#8220;Fie On Goodness&#8221; reverberating around in my head) and a great sense of humour. I got to know him a little, as he came back with us to the apartment, where I exchanged my place in the group with Chris so they could go out to a &#8220;party&#8221; to dance the night away. While the idea was appealing, my cold was winding down, and spending several hours in a smoky environment was a good way to drag that cold out for days.<br />
We took Kathryn and Mareca out for dim sum on their last day in Calgary. Bryce and Karen also attended, as did Stuart and Therese. (Stuart and Therese ended up leaving early, due to Stuart&#8217;s ankle, which he sprained earlier in the day.) After our Oriental repast, we gathered Kathryn and Mareca&#8217;s bags and took them to the airport.<br />
Which was strangely packed. Air Canada&#8217;s history of long line-ups (they said they were busy, which was true, but only because half their desks were closed) came back again. Luckily, instead of the hour wait, Kathryn and Mareca were able to use the Express check-in, and were ready in about 20 minutes. For a delayed flight. The five of us grabbed a table in Tim Horton&#8217;s (a truly Canadian tradition) and wasted time. (Of course, you never really waste time with friends.)<br />
When the time came for them to board, we walked them over to the gate and bid them a safe journey. It was strange &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t really sad to see them go. Probably because I knew I&#8217;d see them (or at least Kathryn) again. But when they did finally leave, I could help but notice how empty things suddenly seemed.<br />
We dropped Bryce off at Theatre Calgary so he could get his bike, and then Chris and I returned home. Things didn&#8217;t look any different, but still something seemed missing. Kathryn had been here for over a week &#8212; it was the longest I&#8217;d seen her since &#8230; well, since ever, really.<br />
So on Sunday night, I finally crawled back into my own bed to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. But I couldn&#8217;t. I tossed and turned, feeling a little empty. It could have been that a close friend was gone, and I didn&#8217;t know when I would see her again. It could have been the foreign feeling of being back in my own room. It could have been that I hadn&#8217;t slept in my bed for 10 days.<br />
I should have slept on the couch.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Wednesday, I came home to something different. Chris and I have a new roommate.<br />
Now I knew about this, so it wasn&#8217;t surprise. Nevertheless, it is taking a bit getting used to. She&#8217;s fairly short, a little overweight, a quite aloof. But she&#8217;s quiet, so we all get along. I suppose the only drawback is her tendency to shed.<br />
Oh, did I forget to mention that our new roommate is a cat?<br />
Yes, we have a cat. Her name is Miao-Yin. For those of you who don&#8217;t get the reference immediately, don&#8217;t worry about it. If I were to tell you, you&#8217;d probably say &#8220;Figures&#8230;&#8221;. For those of you who *do* know the reference &#8230; well, you&#8217;ve probably already said &#8220;Figures&#8230;&#8221;<br />
For the record, incidentally, Miao-Yin isn&#8217;t my cat &#8212; she&#8217;s Chris&#8217;. Those of you who know Chris have probably now done the double take I did when he asked to bring in a cat. I was surprised to say the least &#8212; I never pegged Chris as a cat person. Maybe a boa constrictor person, but not a cat person.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m quite happy about having a cat. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve lived with one. (When you&#8217;ve grown up with cats, you really miss them when you don&#8217;t have them.) Miao-Yin&#8217;s fairly old &#8212; 8 years, so her idea of entertainment is watching Chris trying to entertain her. Actually, I can see the humour in that myself. He tries hard, I&#8217;ll give him that, but getting an older cat to do anything is about as useful as flashlight in the middle of the midday desert. He&#8217;ll learn eventually.<br />
Miao-Yin is a black and white domestic shorthair (which means, of course, that she sheds about a pound of fur a day &#8212; Chris has taken to vigorously brushing her every day). In many ways, she resembles my first cat, Sylvester, who died in 1993. I didn&#8217;t really realize how much I missed Sylvester until Miao-Yin moved in. She&#8217;s definitely not the same cat (Miao-Yin is MUCH more laid back than Sylvester was at 8 years of age), but the memories still come back. I suppose this will be good therapy for loss never truly accepted.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s good therapy in general. It&#8217;s been proven (though for the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember by whom or where that study is) that even just staring at a sleeping cat reduces stress. Miao-Yin sleeps a lot. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been this relaxed in a long time&#8230;<br />
There is only one itty bitty problem with having a cat. It&#8217;s a no-no in our lease. Dunno what the punishment is, but if it&#8217;s like people I knew back in Vancouver, we could face eviction. But I&#8217;m not too worried &#8212; Miao-Yin&#8217;s pretty quiet, doesn&#8217;t smell, and doesn&#8217;t try to run out the door when we open it. Chris&#8217; argument is that the building is supposed to be smoke-free, yet we smell cigarette (and marijuana) smoke all the time. Dunno if that argument would fly, but should it ever come about, we&#8217;ll give it a whirl. Frankly, I don&#8217;t see the problem with cat anyway &#8212; she&#8217;s litter trained, and doesn&#8217;t even claw the furniture (which would probably make it look better, admittedly).<br />
I suppose it could be worse, though &#8212; Chris could have adopted a pot-belly pig.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been one of those years. I really hope I don&#8217;t have to go through another one like that again. Clichéd though it be, it was a year for rediscovery &#8212; mostly of myself. I lost my self-identity in Vancouver, allowing myself to be overwhelmed by another. It takes a while to rebuild that sort of thing. It&#8217;s not done yet, but having gone through that I know now what to avoid should I ever be so stupid as to get myself into that situation again&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I didn&#8217;t think it was possible for 10 days to go by so fast&#8230;<br />
Having missed Christmas at home last year (for reasons I don&#8217;t think I need to go into), I decided a month or so ago to return home and experience Christmas the way it was meant to be experienced &#8212; with too much food, long waits at airports, problems finding the right gifts, and complaining about traffic on the QEW.<br />
Chris and I made the trip home together, leaving Calgary on 20 December. Hearing that the airport had been pretty busy the day before, and that line-ups at Air Canada&#8217;s check-in were often length, I suggested that we head to the airport a bit early (our flight was for 5:15 that afternoon). Our taxi picked us up at about 2:20, and dropped us off at the airport around 2:50. We were at the check-in by 3:00, and all ready to go by 3:05.<br />
For a flight that wouldn&#8217;t leave until 7:00 that night. Lousy delays.<br />
Chris and I spent an enlightened four hours at the airport, discussing many topics (including theology, architecture, physics, literature, and whether or not we&#8217;d be seated with any attractive single women on our flight) and reading. At least it was in Calgary airport, and not in the plane on the tarmac (which I went through in &#8217;98, and wasn&#8217;t too keen on reliving).<br />
Turned out that the plane had hydraulic problems prior to leaving Toronto. Air Canada, in it&#8217;s infinite wisdom, opted to fix the plane &#8230; and not replace it with a working aircraft, thus screwing up schedules (and probably cancelling a flight or two). We didn&#8217;t get into Toronto until 1:30.<br />
Chris and I went shopping the following day, not having brought any gifts with us from Calgary (it was extra bulk we didn&#8217;t want to have to deal with). Chris and I were in generous moods, having both received healthy Christmas bonuses from Critical Mass for all our hard work and diligence &#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s hard keeping a straight face writing stuff like that.<br />
On the 23rd, I headed out to Port Credit to meet with an old friend of mine, Kim. She was a classmate of mine from university (we suffered through possibly the worst technical writing class ever devised &#8212; I&#8217;m certain we students could have instructed that course better than the professor). She and I have gone through similar relationship hells over the past year, and have discussed our horror stories at length over email. It was the first time in about four or five years that I would see her.<br />
Despite a short wait at the train station, we finally met again, although the meeting was a tad awkward &#8212; Kim had let her hair return to it&#8217;s natural brown colour, and I had cut my rather lengthy hair and shaved. Then came the next surprise &#8212; Kim&#8217;s friend Laura. Kim was visiting Laura and her husband Ray, who were gracious enough to put up with me for the afternoon. The surprise came when I climbed into the back seat to meet her mysterious friend, only to realize that I&#8217;d had classes with Laura in university. [Insert music to &#8220;It&#8217;s A Small, Small World&#8221; here.] That pretty much set the stage for an afternoon of pseudo-reminiscing and tech talk (with Ray &#8212; I believe Kim and Laura described it as &#8220;getting along like a house on fire&#8221;).<br />
Laura and Ray were heading off to Stratford for Christmas, so Kim and I ducked out to the GO Station for the trip into Toronto (Kim was going home, I was meeting Chris and friends for dinner and a movie). We continued our talk during the trip. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little uncomfortable, though I honestly don&#8217;t know why. It might have been the gap in time between the last time that I saw her, or I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about next.<br />
Email conversations are so much easier&#8230;<br />
Kim and I parted ways at Union Station, as she had to catch the TTC home. I continued my wanderings in the PATH (Toronto&#8217;s underground mall-cum-labyrinth) and actually managed to find my way to the Eaton Centre without getting lost, taking a wrong turn, or even consulting a map. (No, I have no idea how I pulled that off.)<br />
Still having an hour or so before meeting up with Chris, I completed the last of my Christmas shopping. Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; Christmas shopping at the Eaton Centre at Christmas, I must be insane? Well, if you&#8217;re asking that question, it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;ve forgotten who I am&#8230; That said, it actually wasn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; I expected worse.<br />
Dinner was at Rol San, a Chinese restaurant along Spadina. Chris knew the place from his life in and around Toronto (I can only assume, otherwise he somehow managed to pick the place out of the phonebook). I was the first to arrive (no real surprise there), and began to wait for the stragglers. Chris had already told me (via voicemail) that he would be late (no real surprise there, although in due honesty, it wasn&#8217;t his fault), and that while I could look out for his friend Ellison (whom I&#8217;d never met before), he didn&#8217;t know what her hair colour would be at the time.<br />
Ellison, it seems, is no dummy. A &#8220;lonely-looking single guy sitting at a table for eight&#8221; is a dead give-away, and it took Ellison about two seconds to figure out who I was. We engaged in a long discussion about movies (Ellison is a film geek, and went through the same film program Chris took at Sheridan College) and living in Toronto vs. living in Calgary. About 45 minutes after Ellison, Chris and Natalie (whom I did know) appeared, followed shortly thereafter by Koto, one of Chris&#8217; co-workers from the Japan Foundation.<br />
The movie that night was &#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221;. For those of you who have been living under a rock, this is possibly the single most critically acclaimed movie of the year (I haven&#8217;t heard or read a single negative word about it). It&#8217;s likely going to be an Oscar pick (it&#8217;s already been nominated for a few Golden Globes), and rightly so &#8212; it&#8217;s got an excellent story, an excellent cast, excellent music &#8230; in short, it&#8217;s excellent. Okay, there, I&#8217;ve raved about it. Now go see it (if you haven&#8217;t already) &#8212; you can thank me later.<br />
It was the first Christmas at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s house, and it probably won&#8217;t be the last. Cathy played Santa, handing out the various gifts to those seated around. I won&#8217;t go into detail of the list (unlike last year), but I will say that I was exceptionally happy with my gifts &#8212; especially those I gave. There&#8217;s nothing like the look of surprise and joy in someone else&#8217;s face.<br />
Dinner that night was an affair not soon forgotten. Harking back to the days when my family hosted dinners having an average of 15 people in attendance, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson joined us for our meal. Yes, that is only seven people, but I wasn&#8217;t referring to the number of people &#8212; I was referring to the noise level.<br />
Cathy and Craig received &#8220;The All Canadian Trivia Game&#8221; for Christmas, and the questions became our after dinner entertainment. Being the only remotely sober person, I played Quiz Master. I was surprised at the number of times my dad answered questions that were about people and places I&#8217;d never heard of before &#8212; and I (used to) pride myself on knowing a lot of Canadiana. In fact, I found through this game that I don&#8217;t know as much as I thought I did. [Insert sound of ego deflating here.]<br />
I avoided boxing day sales at all costs &#8212; the last thing I needed was more stuff to take home with me. Instead, I spent my time eating leftovers, relaxing, watching movies, and installing my mother&#8217;s new scanner. I had hoped it would be an easy install. I really should know better by now &#8212; it took me a tech support call to UMAX to learn that I couldn&#8217;t plug the scanner into a powerbar, it needs to be plugged into the wall directly. The answer came so quickly I was surprised they didn&#8217;t have that sort of thing in the user&#8217;s guide&#8230;<br />
I also visited with another old friend (and former roommate), Ed. I met up with him and two of his friends (one of whom I knew from university) at Sega City out in Mississauga. We spent about an hour or so plugging away at the various games before we ran out of money. It was a good thing, too &#8212; the number of kids was rising at an exponential rate, and it was becoming a little too crowded for us old folks. We retreated to Jack Astor&#8217;s for beers and nachos&#8230;<br />
Next thing I knew, it was 30 December. Time to go home &#8230; Calgary, that is.<br />
Chris&#8217; parents picked me up just after 4:00 for our 7:30 flight. Yes, I know that&#8217;s early. The problem was that it had been snowing all day, and Toronto is (or at least used to be) notorious for bad traffic during that kind of weather. Figures &#8212; it was smooth driving all the way to the airport.<br />
Oh yeah, and those long line-ups I&#8217;d planned for? Non-existent. 10-minute check-in. Two hour wait for the flight. Which, of course, was delayed. (The plane we were supposed to get went out of service, probably due to a hydraulic problem, and we had to wait for another 767 to come in from Miami &#8212; it was already in transit &#8212; before we could go anywhere.) Once we&#8217;d gone through de-icing and taxiing, we&#8217;d waited for about four hours.<br />
Calgary was a zoo when we finally got in, just before midnight local time. Luggage took forever to appear, taxis were hard to get, and then to top it all off, the Calgary Police closed off Barlow Trail southbound (effectively the same as blocking off the 427 just south of the airport) for no apparent reason. After all that had happened, I just wanted to go home.<br />
We began the last day of the second millennium AD with dim sum at our favourite restaurant, followed by our ritual visit to A&amp;B Sound. We had several options on how to celebrate the turning of the year, but we settled on a video game and movie session with two friends from work. Unless the world ends tonight (little chance of that), I&#8217;ll be following up this with my annual year in review&#8230;<br />
Happy new millennium. I hope it&#8217;s better than the last one&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a weird week. Imagine trying to do &#8220;business as usual&#8221; knowing full well that in a week you&#8217;d be working out of a new office. That&#8217;s pretty much what last week was like.<br />
Critical Mass is big. As of next week, we&#8217;ll have 252 people &#8230; in Calgary. That doesn&#8217;t count the Chicago, New York, or Stockholm offices. (We&#8217;ll be even bigger once we open the Toronto office. That actually scares some people.) We ran out of space in our old building a long time ago &#8212; it was almost to the point where we would have to start stacking desks just to get everyone in.<br />
So many moons ago, our Operations Manager starting hunting for a new space. That&#8217;s not easy in Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of office space around, but it&#8217;s either occupied or WAY too dull for a &#8220;leading edge interactive marketing agency&#8221;, which I think is how we describe ourselves.<br />
The search went on for months before (somehow) we started negotiations with Mogens Smed, one of the leading interior designers for office spaces. Funky furniture, comfy chairs, and nothing that would be considered really &#8220;corporate&#8221;. It&#8217;s kinda like a step up from IKEA furniture, which is what we had. (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with IKEA).<br />
Smed bought a building just north of the Stampede grounds that had been abandoned for many years. With Critical Mass providing direction (as we were to be the sole occupants), Smed transformed the old Pilkington Glass Company factory into the World Headquarters for Critical Mass.<br />
In six months.<br />
Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed they pulled it off. As Ted (our Chairman) remarked during today&#8217;s &#8220;tour&#8221;, it was an 18-month job done in a third of the time. But you wouldn&#8217;t know to look around. It&#8217;s a quality job. It&#8217;s also a bit getting used to &#8212; everything&#8217;s so &#8230; new. And unused. Kinda like a Star Trek episode&#8230;<br />
The trick, of course, was to get us from our old building and settled into our new building in as little time as possible. That was what happened during the weekend. With a significant amount of prep work by our administration staff, we packed and labelled every single last item in the office, right down to the spare paper clips, before Friday. On Friday morning, everyone came in, packed up their desks into plastic bins, wrapped up their computers, and left by about 9:30am. After that, it was all up to the movers.<br />
We came in around 2:00 in the afternoon on Sunday, on a directive from Ted, to unpack our bins and set up our desks. Aside from a few small things, everything arrived intact an unharmed. Even more shocking was when I got in this morning &#8212; except for our LDAP server, we were up and running. All the phones, the mail server, the Internet connection &#8212; everything. It was all up. Mind you, it wasn&#8217;t without its glitches, but when you consider that the office was moved in a weekend to a new location, and it all works, well &#8230; that&#8217;s a pretty amazing feat.<br />
We have a really interesting deal with Smed. They own the building, and all the furniture inside. We own the computers. We get a really cool office (for a lot less than we should), and Smed gets a really cool company to occupy the space. Smed gets to drag in companies like Coca-Cola to show them what a cool space looks like, and if we happen to pitch a website to them at the same time, well, that&#8217;s business.<br />
Hollywood scripts aren&#8217;t planned this well. (Especially this year&#8230;)<br />
With slightly over two weeks left before I duck out for Ontario for Christmas, the next couple of weeks are going to be really hectic.<br />
But at least I can go insane in a cool building&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About nine months ago, I arrived in Calgary without really too much of a clue of what I was going to do next. For most people, I guess it would be quite stressful (one person comes immediately to mind, though I try not to think about her). It gave me a strange feeling of freedom. For what seemed like the first time in my life, I was free to do as I chose, and it wouldn&#8217;t affect anyone else but me.<br />
A day after I arrived, Chris sent me a reply to the mass message I&#8217;d sent out. It was the start of what we thought would be a grand adventure to Japan. In fact, we&#8217;d coordinated a lot of things to bring Chris here, to get an apartment that suited us both, get us both jobs, and so on and so on, all under the guise that in just over a year, we&#8217;d be heading out to Japan to teach English. Friday 24 November 2000 was the deadline for submitting our applications to JET, the organisation we wanted to go with.<br />
Not long after Chris had arrived here, the two of us were wandering around Calgary, discussing whatever we felt like discussing. (Admittedly, it was usually movies, computers, TV, and/or women, though not necessarily in that order.) Chris said something that surprised me a little. Although I can&#8217;t remember his exact words, he said that there was no way to predict the future, and it was entirely possible that things might change, and we not go.<br />
Well, the deadline has come and gone. And we&#8217;re not going. At least not right now. I&#8217;m not sure what exact processes drove Chris to not submit his application, I know what happened to me.<br />
Complacency.<br />
I&#8217;ll be the first to admit I&#8217;m comfortable. I like my job (although there are a few egos around here I&#8217;d love to deflate), I like our apartment, I like this city, and I like my roommate (that&#8217;s a given, I guess). Humanity, in general, doesn&#8217;t like change. It likes status quo, particularly if it&#8217;s a comfy status quo. Personally, my status quo is a big, warm blanket in front of a roaring fire with a cup of Callebaut hot chocolate.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that I didn&#8217;t want to go. I still do &#8212; there&#8217;s adventure to be had! But at the same time, I no longer felt the need to do something &#8220;radical&#8221;. Had I been able to apply and go within a month or so after arriving, I&#8217;d have gone &#8212; no questions asked. Heck, I probably still would have gone after only a couple of months here. Now? Well, I feel like a replanted tree that&#8217;s had a few months to spread roots. It&#8217;s not impossible to up and leave (I&#8217;ve done it before), but I don&#8217;t have that driving force anymore.<br />
So what happened to Chris? He ran into some problems like mine (it&#8217;s tricky getting the right references, and ours didn&#8217;t come in quickly enough), but he had other reasons, too. (Reasons I&#8217;m not allowed to elaborate on &#8212; so don&#8217;t ask.)<br />
When I missed the deadline, I feeling of tremendous guilt started to wash over me. It could have been the rhinovirus I&#8217;m currently fighting off, I suppose, but there was that hollow feeling you sometimes get when you know you&#8217;ve let someone down. So imagine my surprise when Chris told me he hadn&#8217;t applied, either. Needless to say, I started feeling a lot better &#8230; of course, that could have been the Contac-C I took.<br />
A few weeks ago, Chris and I were wandering around Calgary, discussing the usual (movies, computers, TV, and/or women &#8230; although I should point out our more recent conversations have also included existentialism) when I happened to mention my disinterest in dating. And not because I don&#8217;t want to &#8212; nine months can do a lot, not to mention patch up holes in one&#8217;s soul &#8212; it was because I didn&#8217;t want to hurt anyone when it came time to leave for Japan. Chris had a good point of view on that:<br />
&#8220;Life is what happens between now and your plans. Don&#8217;t stop living for the sake of the future.&#8221;<br />
I swear Chris should write one of those bathroom books. He&#8217;s just full of this stuff.<br />
At any rate, that got me to thinking. Living. That&#8217;s something I hadn&#8217;t done in a while. He had a point &#8212; I was holding myself back for the sake of something vague. So I did the only thing I could do: I went on a date.<br />
Yes, with a member of the opposite sex! (Sheesh&#8230;)<br />
This was Wednesday 8 November. I won&#8217;t tell you her name, but she works here as one of our Art Directors. Wonderful woman &#8230; who was interested in someone else. Of course, I didn&#8217;t know that at the time, but I found out shortly after. Although my sources on the design floor are good, they missed the potential love triangle subplot. I decided it was better to cut my losses before I did something stupid. Probably for the best, too &#8212; I tend to work with her a lot, and I&#8217;d prefer to avoid making things uncomfortable for the both of us.<br />
I won&#8217;t be likely having any more personal escapades for the next few weeks, though. A project I should have started last week finally starts tomorrow. With the same deadline. Yeah, that means longer hours. Whee. And that&#8217;s not counting the company moving to a new building on Friday. (We&#8217;ve been told they&#8217;re be no downtime &#8230; I&#8217;ll believe that when I log in at 8:00 the following Monday morning.) And that&#8217;s still not counting my various research projects and task forces, and updates to the half-a-dozen sites I&#8217;m responsible for.<br />
I love my job. (Can&#8217;t you tell, I&#8217;m here on a Sunday!)<br />
And with that, I&#8217;m heading home. I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;m hungry, and I&#8217;m still sick.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Things have been pretty quiet since the summer &#8212; not a lot of activity, not a heck of a lot to report. But this is a habit I&#8217;ve gotta keep up, if for nothing else so that I&#8217;ll be in practice if/when this Japan thing pans out. Although admittedly, I&#8217;ll probably have much more to talk about then.<br />
Our weekend more-or-less began at 12:45pm on Thursday. That was when we heard: &#8220;Anyone who can hear this, get your butts over the Danish Community Hall now!&#8221; That was the call for our &#8220;Town Hall Meeting&#8221;, a gathering of the Calgary office in one place. Once upon a time (before I started), we could actually congregate in one place in the office. Doesn&#8217;t happen anymore &#8212; we have to go across the street to the DCH so we can hear the speeches.<br />
We hold these about every six months. It&#8217;s mostly so everyone can have an inkling of what&#8217;s going on. (We&#8217;ve got a lot of people spread across a lot of projects &#8212; there&#8217;s no way for everyone to know everything. That&#8217;s not to say, of course, that I don&#8217;t try.) All 250-odd people crammed into the Valhalla Hall for four hours of cheesy speeches, reviews on our projects, really dull organizational ponderings, and an auction.<br />
Yes, an auction. Ted, one of our founders and the company Chairman (Chairperson, whatever!) and the other members of the senior management auctioned off a gourmet meal for 12 people. It&#8217;s a fundraiser (believe it or not) for charity. They wine and dine you, you fork out a lot of money, which when combined with money from Critical Mass (the company), goes towards sending underprivileged to camp in Westbank. (Ted&#8217;s got a thing for Westbank&#8230;) Many people got together in groups of 12 to try and bid for the prize. I say &#8220;try&#8221; because within only a minute or so, the price surpassed anything we grunts could afford &#8212; it was a battle between our CTO and our Director of Project Management. When the dust settled, Ted said the dinner was now for 24, and took both groups. All told, about $22,000 is going to kids. Not bad for five minutes&#8217; work, eh?<br />
The meeting over, we were instructed to attending a post-Town Hall reception at Ceili&#8217;s (it&#8217;s Gaelic, so you pronounce it &#8220;Cayley&#8217;s&#8221;) &#8212; a pub a couple blocks away. By 8pm, the only sober person was Chris. Everyone else was quite inebriated. Luckily for us, Ted had told us we didn&#8217;t have to come in at our regular time (8am) the following morning. This was good. Most people didn&#8217;t show up until 10am. A few didn&#8217;t straggle in until 2pm &#8212; they didn&#8217;t look so good.<br />
Friday night, we met with up with Therese and Stuart (who were somewhat fresh from their trip to Vancouver &#8212; they must&#8217;ve really enjoyed themselves, we&#8217;ve heard much of their escapades; I&#8217;ve listened intently, and been able to picture exactly where they&#8217;ve been and how it looks &#8212; I have to admit that I still miss it) to see &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221;, one of the better movies this year. Haley Joel Osmet (the kid) is one of these once-in-a-lifetime wunderkinds who either go onto huge success or burn out trying. I sincerely hope it&#8217;s more the former than the latter&#8230;<br />
On Saturday, I had the pleasure of keeping an eye on my little cousin, Jen. Hmm&#8230; &#8220;Little&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good word. Let&#8217;s go with &#8220;younger&#8221;. Jen&#8217;s 16 years younger than me. She&#8217;s less than an inch shorter than me. Notice a problem with this? For some reason that I&#8217;ll never understand, the Western side of my family seems to have mutant children that grow to huge heights. Must be the water.<br />
Deciding that I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having her trounce all over me on her N64 all evening, I suggested that I take her to a movie. At first, she wasn&#8217;t too keen, but when I suggested playing video games before the movie, she ran for her coat. The movie was &#8220;The Little Vampire&#8221;. It&#8217;s a cute little movie, though I wasn&#8217;t sure how Jen would respond to it. She&#8217;s at that &#8220;pre-teenager&#8221; stage where kid things are no longer cool, but I&#8217;m not comfortable with dragging her into most of the other movies currently out (although she&#8217;s seen &#8220;Meet The Parents&#8221; and loved it).<br />
We played &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; (the new version &#8212; Jen&#8217;s too young to remember the original) for two hours. Straight. We hurt afterwards&#8230;<br />
Sunday started with dim sum. It&#8217;s almost a ritual for Chris and I &#8212; one more week, and we&#8217;ll have a set pattern that&#8217;ll be hard to break. However, we&#8217;ve run into one itty bitty problem with it &#8212; the line-up seems to be getting bigger every week. Dunno why &#8212; it was fine up until two weeks ago. We need to start going earlier. Stuart and Therese were a bit surprised at the line-up, too, and they&#8217;ve been to Silver Dragon far more often than Chris and I.<br />
The best part about weekends is having no plans. So when Therese suggested we go &#8220;window shopping&#8221;, we eagerly piled into Stuart and Therese&#8217;s new Volkswagen Jetta (complete with possibly the best-sounding stereo I&#8217;ve ever heard in a car) and drove south to Chinook Mall. There, Chris proceeded to attempt to buy something from every store. Of course, that&#8217;s an exaggeration &#8212; he&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230; Therese and I somehow managed to make it out of the mall unscathed, financially-speaking, that is. Chris won the award for most stuff, and for most unusual &#8212; a replica of the old vinyl airline bags of the &#8217;60s. Why? Dunno. It&#8217;s a Chris thing&#8230;<br />
Speaking of airlines, Chris and I will be returning to the wilds of Ontario for Christmas this year, on (or around) the 20th. Tickets have been booked and paid for, so there&#8217;s no holding us back. Unless somebody chains the plane to the ground, that is&#8230;</p>
