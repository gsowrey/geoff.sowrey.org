	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Websites are a hugely powerful information medium &#8212; they can entertain, endorse, educate, even drive a sale. But only if they engage. These are basic elements for anyone in the interactive marketing. Without them, websites are little more than electronic brochures, offering nothing new to anyone reading them.<br />
The web/interactive industry has placed a lot of emphasis on the overused (and insufficiently understood) buzzwords <acronym title="Asynchronous Javascript And XML"><a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a></acronym> and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a>. (The articles linked are the seminal sources of the two trends.) Buzz though they may be, they refer to the increasing demand on websites to produce interactive experiences that go beyond simple pages with forms, links, and copy.<br />
(Under the &#8220;definition&#8221; of Web 2.0, there is much more than interactivity. Community is a significant aspect of Web 2.0&#8217;s direction. This article is concerned with the interface &#8212; the <em>interactivity</em> &#8212; of a given website. The more advanced aspects of Web 2.0 are left for future discussions.)<br />
Website development (not necessarily the <em>technical</em> development &#8212; this applies to the overall process), however, often neglects to view websites holistically. The prime offender is when Flash is rolled into the mix, and the project branches into two entirely separate streams. The Flash stream takes on a life of its own, and the other stream often withers away as a result of resource division (and diversion). Given the interactive and accessible requirements of a website project, this is recipe for failure.<br />
What makes a successful website? It&#8217;s not just budget adherence and customer satisfaction. Does the project meet is requirements? Is it accessible to the planned audience? Does it deliver the message regardless of how the user interacts with the site?</p>
<h3>Thinking About Users</h3>
<p>Users aren&#8217;t always people. We tend to always think about users in human terms. Ultimately, websites are designed for humans, but the number of users goes beyond the human element. No two users of a website are the same. Some users are high-end computers with every possible option in its best possible configuration &#8212; they can get the full experience with no complaint. On the opposite end of the scale are automated users that read content in sites and follow links, such as search engine spiders.<br />
A user is any device that will access and process the instructions of a website. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the user is high-end, low-end, or any point in between &#8212; there should be no difference in importance between users. All are valid, all have something to contribute or gain from a website, and you cannot profile which of those users will have the greatest impact on a website&#8217;s success.<br />
Every user agent that can access the internet reads a website&#8217;s structure and the content it contains: the browsers (IE, Firefox, Netscape, etc.); search engines (Google, Yahoo!, MSN, etc.); cellphones, PDAs, and other mobile devices; even the odd refrigerator. All have different requirements and needs &#8212; but we can account for them all by thinking of our websites in a different way.<br />
Funny thing about those users, though: you can put them in a line and list in order from needing the least support to the most support. In effect, creating a baseline and stating the interfaces than can be layered upon it, including incremental layers for those users in the middle ground.</p>
<h3>Building Websites in Layers</h3>
<p>At their most basic level, websites offer information. How that information appears to a person viewing the site is where things get interesting. In the past, we have viewed only small aspects of a site, namely the ultimate deliverable: how it appears. The implementation comes as a second thought. That secondary focus introduces a lack of focus on the overall solution &#8212; not by necessity, but by side effect. The goal is to view the entire solution and refocus the view.<br />
Websites aren&#8217;t a single deliverable &#8212; they&#8217;re a result of four aspects: content, structure, functionality, and presentation. Each of these aspects contain specific elements that deliver the end result. Some refer specifically to the content, some to the technology. Years of design development have standardized both content and structure. They are well known and understood. Due to the ever-changing nature of technology and the desire to create even more immersive experiences, the definitions of functionality and presentation are in near-constant evolution and have a wider range of definition.<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/aspects.gif"><img width="200" title="Aspects of website components" src="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/aspects.gif" /></a><br />
Content is mostly text, images, and video, feeding into structure: HTML or XML. Application logic and databases are fed by (and feed) HTML and XML. HTML and XML feed into functionality: Flash and AJAX, which unite functionality and presentation. HTML also feeds into CSS.<br />
Fortunately, we can account for the changing nature by building on what is well understood, layering on successive abilities much as you would add slices to a layer cake. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s plain HTML, HTML with CSS, AJAX, or Flash &#8212; it&#8217;s all layers of functionality and presentation.<br />
We used to talk of building &#8220;HTML sites&#8221; or &#8220;Flash sites&#8221;. In &#8220;Flash sites&#8221;, HTML is regarded as little more than for launch pages. The danger in thinking that we should separate HTML and Flash in this way is that we lose a major avenue for reaching an audience. Content is locked in Flash, cutting accessibility for some users, such as mobile devices, search engines, and screen readers. We don&#8217;t need a different paradigm &#8212; just add a new paradigm to see things in a different way. Going forward, we should consider HTML and Flash two be layers of the <em>same</em> website.<br />
First, a redefinition of presentation. Typically, presentation is the last of the four aspects, and deals with the final appearance of a given webpage. &#8220;Presentation&#8221; covered everything that was past showing just the &#8220;raw&#8221; rendered HTML. But presentation shouldn&#8217;t be so broadly defined when taken in context with the user spectrum. Presentation can mean different things to those users, especially in how we can target the final view that they can see. So in addition to considering a spectrum of users, we need to consider a spectrum of presentations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unformatted HTML</li>
<li>HTML with Minimal Layout</li>
<li>HTML with Full Layout</li>
<li>HTML with Full Layout and Client Functionality</li>
<li>HTML with Full Layout and Client/Server Functionality</li>
<li>HTML layered with Rich Media</li>
</ol>
<p>These are <em>considerations</em>, not requirements. While putting all of these into a final website would be ideal, it&#8217;s often too cost-prohibitive to do so, and there might not be any real benefit. Budget limitations will also constrain the list those that will produce the best return on investment (CSS 1.0 support isn&#8217;t really necessary if you&#8217;re not working on PDAs or cellphones, or worrying about browsers released prior to 2002). For the purposes of discussion, we won&#8217;t worry about costs or limitations.<br />
Consider the spectrum of presentations to be cumulative &#8212; each successive layer builds on the former, and parts of each aspect feed in to successive aspects. Thus each successive layer adds additional features and abilities not present in previous layers.<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/layers.gif"><img width="200" title="Aspects of website components" src="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/layers.gif" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Content (text, images, and video) feeds every layer.</li>
<li>HTML (as structure) feeds into every layer.</li>
<li>CSS feeds into every layer except unformatted HTML.</li>
<li>JavaScript feeds into the client and client/server layers, and forms some basis for the Rich Media layer.</li>
<li>Flash feeds only into the Rich Media layer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unformatted HTML</h4>
<p>This is as it sounds &#8212; the rendered HTML, sans any form of formatting (beyond what the browsers apply natively). It&#8217;s the simplest way of presenting a website, but you&#8217;re left to the whims of the user reading the information. (Remember, a user in this case is not a person, but generally software.)<br />
This option is important to note for one particular reason: there are users that don&#8217;t care about what the website actually looks like. They&#8217;re concerned only with the content that appears in them: primarily text and images. It&#8217;s not just search engines, though (we&#8217;ll ignore the fact that they often do &#8220;snapshots&#8221; of a website&#8217;s homepage that does include the presentation) &#8212; think of software to support disabled persons. Users such as that parse only the structure to obtain the correct order for reading out content.</p>
<h4>HTML with Minimal Layout</h4>
<p>Older browsers and mobile devices (cell phones and PDAs), among a few types of users, are limited in their ability to process layout. This is sometimes due to using technology based on older standards, or due to perceived limitations of the specific medium.<br />
In cases such as these, &#8220;layout&#8221; is subjective &#8212; there is little positioning of elements on the page. Due to the level of technology, the majority of support is for basic colour, font definitions, and some minor formatting. This level of support is ideal for the minimalistic agents, which do not require much formatting to present an adequate user interface.</p>
<h4>HTML with Full Layout</h4>
<p>Full layout &#8212; a complete presentation of a design &#8212; is the basis for the goal of a website. It defines the interface parameters and the basic interactive ability. Ultimately full layout defines the branding for the website.<br />
Full layout is generally only supported with the most recent browser set, ones that fully support W3C standards (the stand standards that allow full layout). Very few browsers are considered to be fully-compliant, as according to the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/acid2/">Acid2 test</a>, so even the most recent browsers have some incompatibilities with the expected result. Full layout-capable browsers include (but are not necessarily limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer (Windows platform only)
<ul>
<li>5.5 (some incompatibilities)</li>
<li>6.0 (minor incompatibilities)</li>
<li>7.0 (soon-to-be released, unknown incompatibilities)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Safari (Mac OS X platform only)
<ul>
<li>1.2 (minor incompatibilities)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mozilla-class (Windows and Mac platforms; UNIX platforms by implication)
<ul>
<li>Firefox 1.x (some minor incompatibilities)</li>
<li>Netscape 7.x (minor compatibilities)</li>
<li>Netscape 8.0 (minor compatibilities)</li>
<li>Camino 1.x (Mac only)</li>
<li>Mozilla 1.7+ (minor incompatitibilies)</li>
<li>AOL 7.0 (some incompatibilities due to additional AOL interface)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opera (Windows and Mac platforms; UNIX platforms by implication; unknown support in mobile-supported Opera browsers)
<ul>
<li>7.x (some incompatibilities)</li>
<li>8.x (minor incompatibilities)</li>
<li>9.x (currently in beta; possible full support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these browsers should be directly supported in active development of a website. There is a cost consideration for support, due to the inconsistencies across browsers. Although these inconsistencies are considerly fewer than in previous browser generations (notably the differences between Netscape 4.x and Internet Explorer 4.x), they still incur additional time and effort to correct. As such, we should always conduct a proper profile of client websites before recommending a supported browser set.</p>
<h4>HTML with Full Layout and Client Functionality</h4>
<p>A &#8220;flat&#8221; layout fulfills most of the needs of a website. Additional functionality is sometimes required to meet specific needs. Examples include simple form validation, drop-down menus, and even animations.<br />
This functionality is restricted to the client &#8212; to the browser. Whatever functionality that occurs does so with the browser&#8217;s context. The goal is to add some additional ability to a website, either to enhance someone&#8217;s interaction with a website or to provide a better overall experience. It should be noted, however, that this functionality might not actually benefit all <em>users</em>, since they do not interpret or process all client-side functionality.<br />
From this point forward, the additional layers cease to have effect for all users. Only the higher-end users that can make full use of the layer&#8217;s ability will see a difference. Lower-end users (such as search engines) do not gain anything additional from the layers as they do not interpret that layer&#8217;s additional information.</p>
<h4>HTML with Full Layout and Client/Server Functionality</h4>
<p>The next layer extends functionality past the browser to connect with a server. This allows data interchange beyond the normal HTTP client/server paradigm. (This refers to the normal page request/reload behaviour.)<br />
As a result of bypassing the normal client/server behaviour, we can introduce additional functionality to allow people to interact with server-maintained information and data. Such response times are often very low when compared to page reload, and without the actual page reload occuring, the overall experience with the site is greatly enhanced.</p>
<h4>HTML layered with Rich Media</h4>
<p>Rich media is often viewed as the ultimate way of presenting a website, sometimes at the expense of other requirements. When this happens, the rich media aspect can take on a life of its own, and it loses focus on the holistic requirements of the website. But these are issues with creation and management of rich media &#8212; the layer itself is still of benefit.<br />
Rich media &#8212; such as Flash &#8212; can add a very powerful interactive layer to a website, providing additional functionality combined with strong visuals. The key to the successful use of rich media is to enhance the existing content, functionality, and presentation through the medium&#8217;s abilities &#8212; not to present a dramatically different approach to the presentation.</p>

		<p>We woke late. Had it not been for Allen returning from the office to prepare for Sunday service, I would might have slept entirely though my only chance to actually see him in action. It wasn&#8217;t the service that interests me &#8212; it was seeing Allen doing his thing. If it hadn&#8217;t been for him returning to the apartment, causing a ruckus loud enough to wake the dead (which we almost were), we&#8217;d have slept right through everything. Thankfully, we woke with about 45 minutes to spare, forcing a hurried dressing.<br />
Knox Crescent Kensington &amp; First Presbyterian church sits at the opposite end of Godfrey St. from Allen&#8217;s apartment. It takes only a few minutes to walk that distance &#8212; Godfrey is only four blocks long. The neighbourhood is wonderful to walk through, with its old duplex and triplex buildings, some attached and semi-detached houses, and huge trees that have witnessed countless hundreds of seasons and countless people walking under them. Like the trees south of Montreal, these have yet to sprout their leaves (though some are trying as hard as they can).<br />

		<p>We were a little slow waking up this morning. Might have been due to the change in time, or possibly due to the fact that we&#8217;re beginning to relax on this vacation, or because we simply didn&#8217;t get out of bed. All the crashing and banging however, conspired us out into the day.<br />
Earth Day 2006 would not go unnoticed. Normally, I don&#8217;t really acknowledge Earth Day. The first one was a novel idea, but years later it&#8217;s just something for people to murmur about much as they would about that odd uncle who wears underwear on the outside of his pants. It&#8217;s not something that most people &#8212; myself included &#8212; take seriously.<br />
Today would be different.<br />

		<p>Under normal beginning-of-vacation circumstances, I would have risen without too much a care about work and prepared for my imminent departure to wherever it is that I&#8217;m going. However, things being what they are, I had to work. From home. The joys and detriments of having laptop, a wireless internet connection, and a phone line.<br />
Fortunately, it wasn&#8217;t too much work. In fact, the work was a CMS presentation from Interwoven. All I really had to do was watch the LiveMeeting take place, interject with a few words here and there, and answer a few last emails before logging off and going on my merry little way.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not long after I met Alex, I was introduced to The Vinyl Cafe. This is a weekly show on CBC Radio, featuring the short stories of author and host Stuart McLean. It&#8217;s a wonderful show, and I try to listen to it as much as possible. With the weekly visits to the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market as of late however, I miss the show more often than I hear it.<br />
The Vinyl Cafe is the name not only of the radio show, but also of the fictional store run by Stuart&#8217;s protagonist, Dave. Most of Stuart&#8217;s stories revolve around Dave and his family: wife Morley, daughter Stephanie, and son Sam. Not to mention most of their neighbours, friends, and relatives. The stories take place over many decades, going back to Dave&#8217;s childhood. There are a lot of stories to be heard, such as Dave&#8217;s experience cooking the Christmas turkey or Sam believing his mother is a shoplifter. Most of them are a tremendous mix of hilarity and seriousness. Some will put extreme strain on your bladder, others a tear to your eye.<br />
Stuart is more than just a gifted story teller. He&#8217;s a music geek. This is very clear from the way he writes his stories that involve Dave and his love of music. It&#8217;s not popular music, it&#8217;s good music &#8212; great music. Music that I&#8217;ve rarely heard of. This love of music extends beyond his story-telling, and into his radio shows.<br />
Except for the rare occasions where the show is done from a CBC studio, most of the Vinyl Cafe shows are recorded live in front of an audience. The shows are held across Canada on a series of tours. Stuart doesn&#8217;t do the show alone &#8212; though he could, if he needed to. Stuart&#8217;s love of music brings along mostly-unknown musicians to perform in between story tellings. (And even perform in some of the stories.)<br />
I&#8217;ve seen the Vinyl Cafe live once before, at the Jubilee Theatre here in Calgary. It was the Vinyl Cafe Christmas show. It was my first introduction to the joy of seeing the radio show done live. (The Calgary show might have been recorded, but wasn&#8217;t the one broadcast. From what I gather, the shows sometimes have to be edited to account for things like flubs while reading the stories. The live shows are quite a bit longer than the radio shows (two hours vs. one hour).<br />
Tonight, the Vinyl Cafe came to the Banff (Bamf!) Centre. Not exactly a local venue for Calgary, but it&#8217;s worth the drive. Stuart brought his regular musicians John Sheard and the bassist (whose name I sadly cannot remember). They back him up during the various segments of the show, such as the Story Exchange. John and Stuart usually also throw in a song and dance at the end, which is usually current news and politics thrown into a half-song, half-rap.<br />
Stuart also brought along long-time Vinyl Cafe performer Suzie Vinnick as one of the two featured musicians, the other being newcomer Reid Jamieson. They came and went as Stuart weaved the stories of the evening. They also participated in a classic radio show recreation &#8230; one written by Stuart to be like the shows of yore, the ones who grew up with.<br />
Front row centre seats. Pure fluke that I happened to get them. So close you could almost have received some of Stuart&#8217;s spittle when he got really animated. Which was most of the time. Stuart doesn&#8217;t just read &#8212; he performs. The story sits on a music stand, as Stuart&#8217;s arms fly about in all directions, sometimes adding to the story and sometimes just there. He reads exceptionally, adding levels of inflection and emphasis that one can only guess at if you&#8217;re only reading the story. Hearing it adds that extra level of meaning not normally present. (And for some reason, that includes Southern Albertans getting most of his innuendos. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t laugh at that in Ft. McMurray!&#8221;)<br />
The shows are never long enough. A couple of stories of Dave and Morley, a Story Exchange, and Stuart&#8217;s radio show about Eggs Blackiron (complete with a basket of egg jokes). Soon it was all over, and all there was left was to go home. But rest assured that Stuart won&#8217;t be able to come back this way without me knowing about it, and I will be back. For there is always a reason to see the Vinyl Cafe.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not quite five and a half years ago, [[Moving into Critical Mass&#8217; New Building|Critical Mass moved into our current building]]. It was a monumental exercise that required a lot of forethought, planning, and organization. When we moved into the then-new building, we separated into our departments: Project Management (along with Reporting and some account services) on the first floor, Technology (and internal support) on the second floor, Creative on the third floor, with Administration (and some executives) on the fourth floor. Dewi and the Bistro were in the basement.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much how it was from the moment we got in the building. We&#8217;ve moved around a bit within the floors (I changed seats three times, landing in the same desk space twice), but generally kept the department separation.<br />
That was until a couple of weeks ago, when the Leadership Team (which, apparently, I&#8217;m loosely attached to now) called a meeting to announce the next great move. My first thought was that we were going to move buildings again. We know we&#8217;re running low on available space in this building. We need more people all the time, and are running out of places to put them. Sooner or later, we&#8217;re going to have to lay siege to one of the surrounding buildings and take the space for our own. Personally, I&#8217;m all for buying up the self storage building on the next block and installing a connecting walkway.<br />
But this wasn&#8217;t about running out of space. Well, not directly, anyway. This was Phase 1 of making more effective use of our space. And the first step was to do something that many of us veterans have talked about for years: reorganizing the floors so the project teams sit together. I was a little surprised to hear this, as I honestly thought that the idea had been so thoroughly squashed as to not even render a single drop of whine. We were outlined the almost laughably short timeline under which it would take place, and that no-one would officially know until the week before it took place.<br />
(The irony was that most people already knew &#8212; even before I was told, so I gather. It was one rumour I hadn&#8217;t heard before hearing official notice.)<br />
The trickiest part was that we had to sort out the seating plans so administration could rearrange phones and network connections. (The sad part is most people around here seem to only grudgingly acknowledge the Herculean tasks that Administration regularly pulls off without anyone noticing.) &#8220;Tricky&#8221; because most people had their own thoughts of where they wanted to sit. The task of setting the seating plan, however, would be left to the team leads, to minimize the inevitable cacophony over who was sitting where.<br />
Originally, my business unit was to stay on the second floor. Fine for me, as I&#8217;ve been there for years. Creative, however, wasn&#8217;t so keen on that. As a result of discussions with Misch and Jason, we figured out a plan that would work &#8230; and would give me one of the choicest seats on the floor. (I can rationalize nearly anything. Especially when I can get something good out of it.)<br />
Lest you think I purposely positioned myself to get the best seat, here&#8217;s the reality: I wanted to merge our team members, putting PM next to developer next to designer. In my oh-so-educated [insert sarcasm here] view, it was the best way to try and get projects running, by letting people learn from each other across disciplines and departments. That&#8217;s what I wanted &#8230; but I knew it was going to be a hard sell. Mostly because I&#8217;m the only one who wanted it. So we grouped by department, and the most convenient grouping happened to put the Technology group into the southwest corner. Looking at the desk plan, it just made sense to put me in the corner.<br />
Then we had a business unit rearrangement. Dell&#8217;s been getting bigger and bigger, and finally (like Mercedes-Benz and Rolex before it) be ejected into its own business unit. But it wasn&#8217;t just as simple as moving an account. It meant people had to be moved to handle the movement of the other accounts. It meant the Rolex team had to move &#8212; we were bumped to the third floor. And we had to make a very quick replanning to handle the team&#8217;s movement up one floor. As it stands, we more-or-less moved straight up one floor. And due to fortunate happenstance, I managed to snag the corner desk again. Two windows. Goregous view (compared to what I used to have, anyway). And way too much space.<br />
When we left on Friday, everything packed up and labelled, I questioned whether or not this move would go truly smoothly. My key concern was for things like the side tables. They&#8217;re hot property around the office, and as soon as one becomes available it&#8217;s snapped up. Sure enough, when I arrived on Monday, it was clear that monkey business had ensued in the hours before I arrived. I have no idea exactly what happened, but I sure heard about it.<br />
The other thing I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to hear about is the extra space I&#8217;ve ended up with. There&#8217;s a good desk&#8217;s worth of space between my desk and Jim and Scott&#8217;s. Someone&#8217;s gonna complain about that, I know. Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having someone else in there. It&#8217;s too open. I just don&#8217;t know who would want that space. Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed Jason let me have it. He claimed it was a concession for us having to come to the third floor. Like moving into the best floor of the building is a concession into itself.<br />
Overall, the move is a good thing (irrespective of my desk location). I think it&#8217;ll help the teams work better, even if it means departments suffer a bit as a result. But since our end product is work for our clients, not for ourselves, I think it&#8217;ll go to help the movement. But like many things, only time will tell.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember a young whipper-snapper starting at Critical Mass nigh-six years ago. Another newbie, Angie, had mentioned that she&#8217;d brought his stuff out from Winnepeg. Not that I was far off from being a newbie myself &#8212; it had only been a couple of months since I had started.<br />
Since then, Dennis grew from being a quiet little kid to being the single strongest Senior Web Developer we have &#8230; or probably ever had. Dennis and I sat across from each other when we moved to the new building over five years ago. For a year or so, we would chat with each other over ICQ, rarely actually saying anything to one another. We&#8217;d work late almost every night. And we&#8217;d engage in endless debates about technology and management.<br />
Dennis could always code me under the table. He was a better developer, no two ways about it. He scared me back then. I had mastered the ins and outs of developing for Netscape 4 &#8212; a true pain in the arse to support. And the browser equivalent of the evolutionary dead end. Dennis was already well into DOM-compliant development, and object-oriented constructs. He could code a regular expression in his head &#8212; something I can barely do in a regular expression-capable application reading a dummy&#8217;s guide. Despite his age (he was the youngest person at Critical Mass for about three years running), he developed as fast (or faster) than anyone else and kept his own.<br />
A lot of people around here had the impression that I hated Dennis. I have to admit, I have no idea where that came from. Sure, Dennis did pick me off with an eraser once while I was on the phone, but I was just pissed off that someone had done that while I was on the phone! How did they know it wasn&#8217;t a client? In reality, I had &#8212; and still have &#8212; nothing but the highest respect for Dennis. He ran a team easily twice the size of the one I had with seeming ease, and kept everyone running smoothly. Dennis gets higher praise from his team under pressure than I did managing a team under considerably less strain.<br />
I&#8217;m going to miss that devious smirk of his. You&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Dennis is outspoken when he has a particular point of view. He&#8217;s mostly patient, but when he wants to say something, you&#8217;ll see it. He tries not to immediately jump in, but will eventually force his way in. And he doesn&#8217;t come unprepared.<br />
Tabs vs. Spaces. The single largest and most religious of the debates in programming. Which do you use when writing code? The Senior group finally had it out over a month ago. I brought beer to ease the inevitable pain. There wasn&#8217;t nearly as much yelling as I expected. Dennis had his argument for tabs nailed down. I figured he was going to win even before we started &#8212; he&#8217;d prepared himself for <em>months</em>.<br />
Last Friday was Dennis&#8217; &#8220;going away&#8221; binge. A lot of us went to the Ship (and Anchor) to commiserate with our loss. A few of us got into a heated &#8230; no, actually, just drunkenly loud discussion about the past, present, and future of Critical Mass. Those of us who&#8217;ve been around long enough to see the changes (for better or for worse), and speculate on what will be. I do know this much &#8212; you can&#8217;t go home. You can&#8217;t go back to the way things used to be. Times change, and you have to accept that the people you&#8217;ve known and the friends you&#8217;ve made will eventually go the route they need to, even if it is away from yourself.<br />
Dennis was the #3 guy for Web Dev seniority. Now the #3 falls to Torin, who&#8217;s a year and a half behind me. That gap scares me a little bit. That&#8217;s a long gap between seniority. Mind you, we did have some questionable folks in that gap, and there&#8217;s been a long time for them to filter out. But still, it&#8217;s a little worrisome. Mostly because then the next question is: have I overstayed my welcome? It is not a case of there being a gap &#8230; but me staying too long in one place?<br />
D-Money is gone, off to (assumedly) greener pastures. I&#8217;m gonna miss him, too. I miss a lot of people it seems, and a lot more often than I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;ve written too many entries on people leaving. Inevitable or not for our industry, I still don&#8217;t like when it happens.<br />
Take care, Dennis &#8212; keep shaking things up!</p>

		<p>Ever find yourself providing information to someone as an &#8220;expert&#8221;, where the point of view flows from your lips as easily as drinking a glass of water, and then after you&#8217;ve finished wonder where you learned all that?<br />
Lately, that seems to be happening to me more and more. Someone asks me a question, and I can enter on a diatribe about best practices for creating passwords on application forms, the principles about building websites as best to leverage the content and the technologies, or the best practices in implementing content management when you&#8217;re not even sure what architecture you&#8217;re dealing with.<br />
<em>Where the hell did I learn all this?</em><br />
I think back to my university education. I went to the University of Waterloo. I went there because my high school counselor suggested it. I wasn&#8217;t originally even thinking of Waterloo. I was going to Trent! I wanted to take computer science and rule the world. In Ontario, though, you can only apply to three universities. (There&#8217;s a huge student population, and a lot of universities. Everything goes through a central agency. It&#8217;s weird, but it works.) Waterloo was my #3 choice (I think York was my #2).<br />
I went to Waterloo because they offered me residence, and my parents were adamant about me living in residence. I had no idea what the impetus was for their desire to have me cooped up with 25 late-teen men, but in retrospect I know what they were trying to achieve. My first year at Waterloo remains one of my more memorable. Even today the smell of stale beer still bring back visions of walking down halls in Village 2.<br />
Anyway, I went to Waterloo for computer science. At the time, it was part of the Mathematics faculty. Which meant that you had to take an inordinate number of math classes just to take one lousy computer science class. And let me tell you &#8212; anyone who complained about their math courses at university didn&#8217;t attend Waterloo. Remember &#8212; it was the Math faculty. They didn&#8217;t teach calculus &#8212; they taught you how calculus worked. I got 12% on my first midterm.<br />
Ouch.<br />
That should have been my first indication that perhaps I might not be long for the Mathematics faculty. Despite getting into the computer science stream in second year, and doing reasonably well in my classes, it was clear by the end of my second year at Waterloo that either I switched to a different line of study, or my arse would be sporting skid marks before too long.<br />
English Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Yep, I&#8217;m officially an Artsie. I took all sorts of wacky courses at Waterloo: psychology, philosophy, physics, calculus, algebra, statistics, literature (several versions), music appreciation, Latin, Spanish &#8230; most of them aimed directly at my new-found major, but I still took the time to take computer science. Management information sciences (which was a total waste of time &#8212; I could have learned that course by reading a text book), development methodology, and networking theory (I learned how the internet actually works). But very little programming.<br />
In fact the most programming I did after going into English was learning how to write HTML &#8212; something I got from my English Rhetoric 209 professor, Neil Randall. He scribbled a few tags on the board and gave us the option of either turning our essays in traditional paper, or online. (Little did I know where that would ultimately take me&#8230;) But none of my university career taught me what I know now &#8212; certainly not to the depth that I seem to have acquired.<br />
Out of university, I was a technical writer, taking the love of writing and my technical know-how and actually making a viable career out of them. But I bored of it. A lot. Soon, I couldn&#8217;t stand technical writing. It was dull, repetitive. Mind-numbing, even. When I worked for Radical Entertainment, I took it upon myself to build some web-based productivity tools (such as a room booking tool) to avoid going insane.<br />
When I started here at Critical Mass, I was hardly a web development expert. I was green. But back then, I was a butt in a seat, earning the company money. It didn&#8217;t matter how much or how little I knew. It was that I could do <em>something</em>. I&#8217;d never heard of an application server, never worked with a content management system, had a clue about any formalized process whatsoever, could barely code enough Javascript to do anything useful, and CSS was the most minimal skill for me. (Were I to apply to Critical Mass today with the skills I had when I was originally hired, I wouldn&#8217;t make it through the resume review round, let alone get an interview.)<br />
Green as bamboo, and just as inflexible. Sure, I could bend, but there was no way I could hold my own to the people who&#8217;d been working there longer than I and understood the industry a lot better. I had to give into requests &#8212; no matter how outrageous &#8212; and accept direction from others.<br />
That&#8217;s what I think about &#8212; that kind of helpless ignorance &#8212; when I stop and wonder how on Earth I managed to say something I didn&#8217;t previously know. And to some degree, still wonder if I actually know it. I don&#8217;t know if any of you have been in this situation, but when I get to talking about things that a mere six years ago I wouldn&#8217;t have given a second thought to (even if I knew enough to do so), I feel like I&#8217;m in some kind of verbal auto-pilot. It just comes out on its own.<br />
It&#8217;s truly strange. I&#8217;ll actually be thinking to myself, as my mouth is motoring along, how is it that I can be saying these things? I&#8217;m not even actually <em>thinking</em> about what I&#8217;m saying! It&#8217;s just coming out, as if someone else were in control of my mouth. It&#8217;s like some freaky version of <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, except I have no idea who&#8217;s in my head or if they get dumped out on the Jersey Turnpike. More likely the intersection of Barlow and 56th near the truck stop, I think.<br />
I always seem to know what to say. So far, I have yet to put my foot in my mouth. I haven&#8217;t said anything truly stupid. But I&#8217;m sure that day is coming. That&#8217;s what I fear most. That I&#8217;ll be in the middle of a good oration on the best way to handle organic search implementation with one of our clients when something comes out that I didn&#8217;t expect. It&#8217;ll sound something like this:<br />
&#8220;The goal is to make sure that the document structure properly contextualizes the content, and is seeded with the keywords from the analysis phase. Rumper gilford flamma-lamma-ding-dong walla walla *snort* willy come home and BANG!&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s going to happen. I know it. The facade will come crashing down and I will be exposed for the phony that I sometimes believe myself to be. I still think of myself as that naive web developer, hired to slap together promotional web properties. I didn&#8217;t care about the standards, how to manage people, the intricacies of client communication, or internal politics. I was a grunt. I still feel like I am, and that somehow I&#8217;ve gotten where I am without truly knowing what on Earth I&#8217;m doing.<br />
The reality is that I <em>do</em> actually know. I just don&#8217;t know that I know. Over the years, I&#8217;ve written a series of handy managerial routines that kick in when needed. It&#8217;s an automatic process, digging out lots of stored bits of knowledge and experience. I suppose this is what it&#8217;s like to have experience &#8212; and dare I say it, wisdom. You just know it. Temet Nosce. The whole Neo-save-the-world thing. You don&#8217;t have to think about it. It&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s ready and waiting to come out. You only need tap the resource, like uncovering an underground stream &#8212; it just flows out.<br />
Still, it&#8217;s weird. I wonder how long it&#8217;ll be until I get used to this?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>James on Monday. Rudy on Friday. I can&#8217;t make any &#8220;Rudy Tuesday&#8221; jokes on this one, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
Rudy was only the second Web Developer that we hired after moving into our current building (I can&#8217;t say &#8220;new&#8221; building, &#8216;cuz it ain&#8217;t new anymore). And that was almost a year after we picked up Carl.<br />
Rudy was one of our workhorses. Give him a task, and let him loose. Didn&#8217;t matter how much time he needed to put into it, didn&#8217;t matter what the estimate was. He got it done, and it was done when it was promised. A quality that is not only admirable, but hard to come across. And it no doubt hurt Rudy&#8217;s social life, at least to some degree.<br />
I never once heard Rudy complain over the years. Admittedly, I&#8217;m not sure complaining is even in Rudy&#8217;s nature. A couple of years ago, Rudy was in a fairly nasty motorbike accident, basically screwing up his legs for a month or two. But even when he struggled in for Jude&#8217;s farewell (see [[So long, Jude!]]) on crutches, he was still all smiles and laughs. I suppose that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to miss most about Rudy.<br />
Rudy was one of the popular crowd, something I never was. Never been a popular person in general, really. I&#8217;m Joe Average. I have my ups and down, but when it comes to the end of the day, I don&#8217;t stand out, make waves, attract, or repel. In a group of two, I&#8217;m the one you won&#8217;t see. I wasn&#8217;t part of the 5% &#8212; even if I was included in a couple of events &#8212; and generally only find out about things after they happen.<br />
That sort of thing really used to bother me a lot, being left out. I was never sure of it was a conscious thing: &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t call Geoff &#8212; we don&#8217;t want him around here!&#8221;. Or was it just merely that I&#8217;m forgotten? Hard to say which is worse &#8212; exclusion or insignificance. They both pretty nasty. It&#8217;s also hard on the ego, being left out like that. It really makes you think about the friends that you have (or don&#8217;t have), and how people ultimately view you.<br />
I&#8217;ve come to accept that I&#8217;m generally not liked. (Hopefully, it doesn&#8217;t extend to me being outright hated.) At best, I&#8217;m tolerated. I can&#8217;t trace the thousand steps it took me to get where I am. It&#8217;s those thousand steps &#8212; or thousand cuts? &#8212; that slowly wore away at any appeal that I did have (and probably some of the credibility, too). I might get the job done, but generally I&#8217;m just a bastard. An ass. Maybe it&#8217;s my own self-importance speaking to me, I&#8217;m not sure. But I know that people treat me differently now than they used to even a couple of years ago. And I feel alone.<br />
With Rudy&#8217;s departure, isolation sinks in more and more.<br />
Rudy was supposed to be my major project this year. Despite being at Critical Mass about three and a half years, he never made it to Senior. I felt he was ready, just that we needed to push him a little more. It was all minor stuff, too. And that the opportunity we had planned for him on the Michelin projects didn&#8217;t come through the way we&#8217;d planned. In many ways, I feel like I failed him.<br />
There&#8217;s almost none of the old guard left. After Dennis, it&#8217;s about a year and a half before you get to Torin, the next most senior web developer we have. I talk to those who&#8217;ve gone to &#8220;greener pastures&#8221;, and I wonder what it would be like out there. In a little over two weeks, I complete my sixth year here at Critical Mass. I&#8217;ve come a long way &#8230; but at what cost? Maybe I&#8217;ve become too complacent? Have I been responsible for too many people leaving? Am I even competant in my job anymore?<br />
I ask myself questions like this more and more. I do what I think is right, but is it? Maybe Rudy&#8217;s got the right idea &#8212; get out while you can and do something else. Work someplace different. Reground yourself before it&#8217;s too late. And maybe I am where I&#8217;m supposed to be. Maybe I&#8217;m already in the only place I can be. Oh, the questions&#8230;<br />
Good luck, Rudy. We&#8217;re gonna miss you &#8217;round the farm. Wherever you land, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Google is the power in the internet right now. Issues with <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/soapbox/google-censorship-china.shtml">censorship</a> aside (and their suddenly lacklustre results in the stock market &#8212; the revaluation is long overdue), Google still remains the top search engine and one of the best ways to engage in online marketing.<br />
Which is the primary reason why when Google comes to town, you make an effort to drop by.<br />
The CCAT &#8212; the <a href="http://www.ccat.org/">Calgary Council for Advanced Technology</a> &#8212; conducts regular meetings. What exactly this group does, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. But they do seem to arrange for an interesting networking opportunity.<br />
Originally, I wasn&#8217;t really interested. Jim sort of goaded me into it, though. Aside from the fact that it was Google, it seemed like getting an entire table of us (eight, in total) would be possible &#8230; but only if I went. I figured, if nothing else, a change to see what else Google had up their sleeves might be something worth seeing.<br />
The night started off at the Telus Convention Centre (lower level of the Glenbow Museum, to be specific), in what I can only describe as the largest networking scene I&#8217;ve yet seen in Calgary. I was hardly a shining example, focusing mostly with Rob (a former co-worker), Mark (from the Green Party of Canada), and a guy who specialized in PDA solutions. Hugh (whose name was recorded as &#8220;High&#8221;) scored about at least a dozen cards in the time we were there. There&#8217;s a man I need to learn a lot more from when it comes to meeting new people!<br />
Table 20 was just us: Dave, Ryan, Allard, Nichole, Chantelle, Jim, Hugh, and myself. Ryan and I ended up with our backs to the stage, where Wendy Muller of Google would speak later on. Until then it was a variety of speakers from around the Calgary community. The only good one (I think) was the CEO of West Canadian, George Brookman. He had a calm, easy demeanour (and apparently knew most of the people in the room &#8212; including the mayor) and leapt into a speech that sounded completely off-the-cuff, and yet completely practiced.<br />
Sadly, he would remain the best speaker of the night. The president of the CCAT read his script, and didn&#8217;t sound at all at ease in front of the room. Normally, the uneasiness should pass in a couple of minutes (or so I&#8217;ve read). Normally.<br />
The keynote was Wendy Muller, the VP of Marketing for Google Canada. She&#8217;s been in the marketing industry for a couple of decades and seems to know her stuff. A couple of things were clear, however, during the course of her speech. First, as much as others look to Wendy to be the &#8220;voice&#8221; of Google Canada, Wendy doesn&#8217;t understand her field.<br />
She&#8217;s been at Google for four years. But she doesn&#8217;t get the point. She doesn&#8217;t get the technology. She&#8217;s an old-school marketer. She knows the way things used to be done. The new way still seems to escape her, however. The presentation was short, and the Q&amp;A period even shorter. Questions were often specific, but Wendy either hasn&#8217;t learned how to divert the answer (the two most common responses were &#8220;no comment&#8221; owing to specific internal situations; or a very long-winded answer, signifying nothing, ending with &#8220;does that answer your question?&#8221;).<br />
And like the president who introduced her, she read her presentation, too. I&#8217;m no speaking guru, but even I know that you should practice your presentation. Make it sound good. Go over it again and again and again until you know it so well that you don&#8217;t need your notes. You should only glance at the presentation to make sure you&#8217;re covering all the points that are there. If you&#8217;re reading the points in their entirety rather than using them as a summary &#8230; might as well email the bugger to everyone on the list and save them the hour.<br />
Well, the meal was pretty good. So perhaps it was ultimately worth it. Even if I didn&#8217;t win the iPod up for grabs.<br />
I think Wendy needs to attend one of the major Search Engine Strategy conferences, and get to see how others present from her company. There&#8217;s a wad of Googlers who are lower-rung than her, and present a lot better. Wendy didn&#8217;t really say anything that I didn&#8217;t already know to some extent (clarification on statistics notwithstanding). And I doubt that I&#8217;m the only one thinking that.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another one bites the dust.<br />
I hate it when friends leave, even if it&#8217;s just to go to another company in the city. And with James&#8217; departure, it hits a little more. Not just because I saw a lot of my older self in him, not just because he was one of our Sr. developers, or even just because he single-handedly put an end to reply-alls in the building for a long time.<br />
It&#8217;s probably because this place will be a lot quieter without him.<br />
I still remember when James started. He was a young, brash, loud, and potentially brilliant developer. Which meant that certain people on the team immediately hated him. Why? Because James rocked the boat by refusing to fall in line. Unlike those of us who chose to go against doctrine in a more passive manner, James was much more vocal. Where others use subtlety, James used subterfuge. When others whispered, James cracked a whip.<br />
Very early on, James single-handedly took on the issue of people replying to companywide emails with trivial points, often engaging everyone in a conversation that no-one truly cared about. James&#8217; approach? The most effective weapon in his arsenal: comedic, sometimes outright mocking images. They did an exceedingly good job at putting replies to an end. James&#8217; first image was beautifully simple: a small boy, praying at the side of a bed (presumably before he went to sleep). The caption read: &#8220;Please God, make it stop.&#8221;<br />
James&#8217; second reply was to a CEO&#8217;s email. I suggested that he might want to back off until he at least passed his probationary period.<br />
I saw a lot of myself in James, only amplified a few times. The brashness of youth, the self-realization of brillance, the demands of excellence. James has yet to reach the age I was when I started (though he is close now), and I wonder if he will mellow over the years in the way I have calmed down. (Those of you who knew me as a teenager/early 20-something will no doubt find that hard to believe.)<br />
I had hoped we could hang onto James, but after three-ish years it&#8217;s hard to hang onto veterans. That&#8217;s the nature of our industry &#8212; a couple years here, a couple years there, and the process goes on. The loss of experience and knowledge is often hard to deal with. It hurts every time we lose a long-term employee. We&#8217;ve seen this loss many times over, and we&#8217;ll see it again and again &#8212; the nature of our business.<br />
Amy. Luke. Adam. Mark. Dave. Jaime. Christine. Andrew. Jude. Scott. Angie. Pat. Carl. Rich. Vlad. Neil. Tamara. Bill. Myles. Damon. Ed. Cory. Jules. Reid. Darren. Nancy. Rob. Jen. Graham. Dave (a different one). And that&#8217;sonly just those I can easily remember. I missed recording most of the departures over the last year due to my blogging inactivity. (There&#8217;s a thousand reasons for that, none of which have any real validity when it comes down to the fact that I just didn&#8217;t do what I should have been doing.) So for all of you who have left who wonder where your farewell is &#8230; I can only apologize.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not blaming anyone for this. Ours is a hard industry, and it&#8217;s hard to stay here for long without the desire to move on. That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that the pressures of the job don&#8217;t get to you first. Client demands are often a hard thing, and they can wear you down. Even in the lower echelons, where client contact rarely happens, the trickle-down effect can be quite pronounced.<br />
I suppose after a while you become immune to the pressure. Or you find a way of dealing with it. Or you go insane. Heck, there&#8217;s really only four options, and if you don&#8217;t decide to move on, you succumb to each of the other three over time &#8230; though the order in which each of them gets you is different from person to person. I think I&#8217;ve almost reached the &#8220;immune&#8221; stage. Or at least, I hope I&#8217;ve almost reached it.<br />
So James is gone. Unlike Scott or Jude, though, he&#8217;s still in town. So it&#8217;s not so bad. And Mike has returned after his effective exile of about four years ago. Rudy&#8217;s going soon, so that&#8217;s something else to contend with.<br />
Times they are a changin&#8217;. For better or for worse, that&#8217;s how life goes. It sucks when friends aren&#8217;t as readily accessible as they were before, but at least &#8212; if nothing else &#8212; the internet does make communication significantly easier.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You could almost have called last night&#8217;s telecast &#8220;The George Clooney Show&#8221;. That man attracts far too much attention for being only one person in Hollywood.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that he doesn&#8217;t deserve attention, but come on&#8230;<br />
I have to admit, I wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled to hear that Jon Stewart was going to host the Oscars. This is an event where the right person can do a spectacular job. Witness the years Billy Crystal and Steve Martin have hosted. The wrong person turns it into a complete fiasco, and you really wonder where the hell it&#8217;s all going. Witness David Letterman.<br />
Despite missing most of the red carpet show (thankfully, no real fashion accidents this year &#8212; though I do have to say that&#8217;s most of the reason I watch that segment, anyway), I sat down with my ear-to-ear grin to watch the show. It started a little differently than previous years. In lieu of reviewing the movies that had come out and were nominated (as Crystal is oft to do in song), it was a recap of the hosts over the last ten or so years, all explaining why they couldn&#8217;t host. The nearest any of them really got to any one movie were the first two: Billy Crystal and Chris Rock, in a tent in a lush valley in the mountains. Both were &#8220;busy&#8221;.<br />
Ironically enough, the funniest one was David Letterman, who claimed he couldn&#8217;t do it as he was watching over Steve Martin&#8217;s kids, so they wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;grow up funny&#8221;. (Steve had delivered the joke a couple of people earlier. The kids &#8212; and a dog &#8212; wore wigs reminiscent of Steve&#8217;s own white locks.)<br />
Jon Stewart woke up from a dream, believing that he was asked to host the Oscars. Only to find himself in bed with Halle Berry. Another dream. When he reawoke, it was George Clooney. Not a dream. Sorta. Clooney didn&#8217;t really seem to be enjoying himself on that one, admittedly. But it wouldn&#8217;t be the last time that evening.<br />
Most of the segments in the show were obviously due to Jon Stewart&#8217;s Emmy award-winning writing team. (The faux mudslinging ads for best actress and best sound mixing, modelled after the well-understood and well-used paradigm of political ads during election campaigns.)<br />
There were a couple of slip-ups during the presentations. Morgan Freeman flubbed a line. Lauren Bacall, out to introduce the timeless film noire segment, had extreme difficulty with her lines &#8212; almost to the point where I thought she was going to give up and leave the stage. But she&#8217;s a quintessential performer, and got herself back on track to a complete finish. (My guess? The teleprompter ran too quickly.)<br />
Yes, the Academy Awards are completely insular. They&#8217;re a reflection of Hollywood&#8217;s self-congratulatory nature, and really have no bearing on any dose of reality outside of the Los Angeles area. So what? It&#8217;s a chance to escape into something completely unnecessary, and watch famous people get jealous on each other.<br />
It&#8217;s also a chance to watch some interesting turns of event. While there was no surprise that &#8220;Wallace and Grommit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#8221; won for Best Animated Feature, nor that &#8220;March of the Penguins&#8221; walked away with Best Full-Length Documentary, there were a few surprises. I hadn&#8217;t expected Reese Witherspoon to snap up Best Actress. Judi Dench, certainly, but not Reese. I&#8217;m not suggesting that she&#8217;s not worthy of the nod, but I wonder what exceedingly minor role Dame Judi will win Best Supporting Actress for next year. Ang Lee wasn&#8217;t a surprise per se, but the competition was stiff. Philip Seymour Hoffman for Best Actor? Not completely surprising &#8212; he&#8217;s an outstanding actor &#8212; but my money was on Brokeback&#8217;s Heath Ledger.<br />
Which does bring up an interesting point: &#8220;Brokeback Mountain&#8221; didn&#8217;t do nearly as well as the buzz suggested. Sure, the buzz is non-binding, but when you consider that the buzz had got to come from <em>somewhere</em>, there much be an iota of truth in it, right? I&#8217;m sure the theme to Brokeback will haunt me for years to come, much as the theme from &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; still does.<br />
The broadcast kept to schedule, and finished on time &#8212; even a little early (by a couple of minutes, anyway). It wasn&#8217;t the best Oscar show I&#8217;ve ever seen, but it was far from the worst. And Jon Stewart? I think he could successfully host again. Once he got into his groove, he was an able host. Not as much an insider as Billy Crystal, and certainly not a lyrical, but at least he doesn&#8217;t try &#8220;Uma, Oprah&#8221; jokes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are a many things that I am grateful for: a loving family, a good job (even if it does stress me out a lot and keeps me insanely busy), good health, high speed internet connections, snow, sunshine, a warm bed, a hot shower, food on my plate, my friends (though I seem to have fewer these days &#8212; my own fault), and my sanity (what little of it that seems to remain, anyway).<br />
Now I have one more thing to add: fuzz therapy.<br />
Not quite a month ago, Asia entered the family. Not the continent &#8230; the cat. Asia is now the fourth cat I&#8217;ve had in my life. And I hope that she&#8217;s here for a long time to come.<br />
My first cat was Sylvester, a black and white domestic short hair (DSH) that I got from my Aunt Ruth. A pregnant stray barn cat wandered into her home (on a farm, of course), and gave birth to a litter of kittens. Smiley, as she became to be known, mothered them for a while before the offspring were given away. I got one of them, and Sylvester Q. Pussycat (as Dad used to call her) was with my family for 18 long years. We had to put her down &#8212; or rather, the task fell to Mom &#8212; when one day, Sylvester seemed unable to keep living, but hadn&#8217;t the strength to die.<br />
Not long afterwards, we inherited my grandmother&#8217;s cat &#8212; a lovely siamese called Spaz. That&#8217;s why I called her, anyway &#8212; I was the only one in my family to use that name. Spaz was originally named &#8220;Yum Yum&#8221;, after a character in the Mikado. Like Sylvester, Spaz was a gift from my Auth Ruth (although Spaz was purebred, not a stray) to keep my grandmother company. Spaz got her name due to her rambunctious nature &#8212; she tended to wreak havoc around my grandmother&#8217;s house. That led to her being declawed in the front, and led to her calming down a bit.<br />
When Grandma had to move out of her house, my family took Spaz in and she became one of the family. And the neighbourhood terror. To other animals, that is. To people she was, well, the cat&#8217;s meow. She loved everyone, and (almost) everyone loved her. But if you were another cat, or a dog, or a raccoon, or a fox, or even a skunk, you were in for some trouble. Spaz took on almost everything. In her years, she lost only twice. One, sadly, to a skunk. (That was really troublesome, considering her affectionate nature.) The second time was to the neighbour&#8217;s Jack Russell terrier, a dog that most of the neighbourhood wanted to see as road pizza. Never put a mark on Spaz, but she didn&#8217;t go outside again for days.<br />
Spaz&#8217;s health would decline in her later years, mostly due to asthma. In the end, I finally [[Putting down my beloved Siamese cat|had to put her down]]. Without question the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. A couple of things have come close since, but nothing else has quite had the same impact.<br />
Cat #3 is Miao Yin, another domestic short hair. Miao Yin was another stray, picked up by my roommate Chris &#8212; a man allergic to cats. I might never fully understand Chris&#8217; reasoning for getting a cat, but I certainly didn&#8217;t mind. Even if Miao Yin had a tendency to not always use the litter box or meow incessantly when she wanted to be fed. Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t the most melodic meow, either. But without question one of the most even-tempered animals I&#8217;ve ever known &#8212; never bit or scratched anyone. And she was a great lap warmer.<br />
Miao Yin is still alive and kicking, despite a minor bout of diabetes, which she seems to have overcome. Miao Yin is now with Tamara, a successive roommate of mine. A change in my life required that I give Miao Yin away &#8212; allergies are a hard thing to overcome, and I didn&#8217;t want to cause too many problems. Luckily, Tamara had bonded quite well with Miao Yin, so she has done very well in her new home. I haven&#8217;t seen her in almost a year now, but I imagine she&#8217;s quite happy.<br />
I had resigned myself to never having a cat again. Which is hard, because I love cats. They&#8217;re the perfect pets, in my view. Sure, some people believe their aloof and self-centred. (Obviously, they&#8217;ve never hung around with humans.) But I find them absolutely warm and personable. You just need to spend the time to get to know them, and for them to get to know you.<br />
Take Asia, the newest addition. She&#8217;s also an ex-stray. She&#8217;s a tabby, or at least tabby-like colouring (with white feet, chin, and belly), about a year and a half old. A little under a month ago, she was just another anonymous cat in the SPCA&#8217;s system. Temporarily taking up residence in the Pet Cetera in southeast Calgary, she didn&#8217;t initially know what to make of this strange person with a beige corduroy jacket and black leather gloves. She was resistent, cautious, but at the same time strangely playful and very interesting.<br />
&#8220;Allergies be damned&#8221;, I heard &#8212; the cat had to come home. And so she did, the next night. She immediately hid behind the furnace. An hour later, she was on the main floor of the house, trying to get an idea of where on Earth she&#8217;d managed to end up. And who were these two strangers?<br />
Petting her was inviting a bite and scratch. Asia had no idea what we were doing, and I suspect that whomever had owned Asia before us had mistreated her quite badly. Even a month later, approaching hands cause her to rear back a bit. A quick sniff seems to quell the issue and she&#8217;ll usually open up to a good chin or belly scratch. However, she still has her claws, and they&#8217;ve since grown back in (they had been heavily worn down, according to the SPCA&#8217;s records). They&#8217;re sharp, too. Little cuts abound in places, but Asia&#8217;s slowly learning that claws aren&#8217;t acceptable.<br />
Especially on the furniture.<br />
Allergies are still an issue however. The day after Asia arrived at home, colds struck. How&#8217;s that for pathetic irony, eh? It was almost impossible to tell what was cold and what was allergy. Asia didn&#8217;t seem to mind or care &#8212; she was still getting attention, food, and a warm place to stretch out. The colds subsided and left, a new filter inserted into the furnace, and an ionic cleaner in the bedroom seemed to improve matters as well. An old bedspring also helped keep Asia out of the bedroom &#8230; at least until she learned how to jump on top of it. For now, a large crumpled sheet of aluminum foil seems to keep her at bay. (And before you ask, no, there is no door to the bedroom. Open concept is neat until you need to keep a cat under control.)<br />
So now I have some fuzz therapy to help me out. When I&#8217;m feeling stressed out or blue, I go find Asia. Unless she&#8217;s having her daily freak out (I still do not understand why cats do that), she never seems to mind a good stroke or two. And her purr goes a long way to clearing the cloud of doubt.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The definition of &#8220;patent&#8221;, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#patent">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. U.S. patent grants are effective only within the United States, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions. Under certain circumstances, patent term extensions or adjustments may be available.<br />
The right conferred by the patent grant is, in the language of the statute and of the grant itself, &#8220;the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling&#8221; the invention in the United States or &#8220;importing&#8221; the invention into the United States. What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import, but the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the invention. Once a patent is issued, the patentee must enforce the patent without aid of the USPTO.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s quite a bit more to that definition, but this is as good a place as any to start. Mostly because this is the key point at which the problems seem to start: &#8220;the right to exclude others from [doing anything with] the invention&#8221;. Basically, suing people to ensure that you either get royalties or stop them from doing anything with the invention in question.<br />
And more importantly it is the term &#8220;invention&#8221; that I have issue with.<br />
Lately, it seems that there are a number of companies quite content with registering patents for &#8220;inventions&#8221; that are little more than an extension of logical progression &#8212; something that was bound to come in just a matter of time. But due to the way that American Capitalism works, there is money to be made &#8230; even if you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to get it.<br />
A few people were applauding the USPTO&#8217;s decision to grant a patent on the techniques used to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180206472">implement rich media interfaces on the internet</a> (and pretty much anything that would connect to the internet, including set-top boxes, wireless devices, and the odd refrigerator). This was filed by Balthaser Online, a one-man operation who happened to think of the idea (filing the application for the patent, that is) before anyone else.<br />
Sound familiar? It should &#8212; a similar sort of broad-ranging patent was filed by Eolas Inc. to handle the method in which plug-ins were included in webpages. That&#8217;s a little thorn in the side of the internet that&#8217;s raged for years, now, with pipsqueak Eolas taking on Microsoft Corporation for over US$520 million in compensation.<br />
Compensation for what? For having an idea? Having <em>just</em> an idea? Where the hell is the value in that? Can anyone tell me why on Earth someone should be awarded over half a billion dollars for an idea? Especially if you didn&#8217;t sell it to someone first?<br />
Both Eolas and Balthaser have something in common: they beat someone else to the punch. They filed patents for things that others were thinking of (or would think of shortly thereafter) &#8212; things that others would expand upon and turn into industry standards and solid techniques. In the case of Eolas, the basic idea of including a plug-in was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium and became the de facto way to include items other than HTML into a given webpage. For Balthaser, they&#8217;ve successfully patented a method for using rich media to present an interface. This includes the use of Flash, Flash, AJAX, and XAML. This affects pretty much every aspect of the much lauded Web 2.0.<br />
But where is the <em>innovation</em>? Sure, they beat everyone else to the punch, but what did those companies do to push their &#8220;inventions&#8221; further? From what we can see, all they did was sit around and wait for the USPTO to approve their patents so they could then turn around and license their patent to those who wanted to use the same ideas, or sue those who refused to cough up the dough.<br />
I side with the companies trying to defend themselves against such ridiculousness &#8212; yes, even Microsoft. I want them to win their little spat against Eolas. Tell me that this makes any sense at all. Did Eolas strike out at every browser maker who has ever used a plug-in? They could have gone after Apple and AOL (owners of Safari and Netscape, respectively). Nope. Just Microsoft. Why? Money, what other possible reason could their be? This is the kind of insipidness that comes as a result of allowing patents on broad concepts that are in development in an industry in several places, or already formed and one person happens to patent it first.<br />
Patents weren&#8217;t intended for &#8220;armchair inventors&#8221; &#8212; they were meant for people who wanted to actually do something with it. Look at the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>, the man credited with inventing (and patenting!) vulcanized rubber. This is a guy who wanted to make a difference, someone who had a vision and was willing to follow that vision to the bitter end. And it was a very hard trail &#8212; he and his family lived in poverty (Goodyear himself was in and out of debtor&#8217;s prison) for most of their lives because of Goodyear&#8217;s obsession with creating vulcanized rubber and trying to market his invention. The poor living conditions led to the death of his son.<br />
Goodyear defended himself in court against a wealthy (and unscrupulous) businessman, Horace Day, who had purchased several of Goodyear&#8217;s first run with the invention &#8212; shoes &#8212; to figure out how it was made so he could duplicate the process. The case, known both as &#8220;Goodyear vs. Day&#8221; and the &#8220;India Rubber Case&#8221; is well-known in patent legal precendent for defending an inventor&#8217;s rights to profit from their hard work.<br />
That&#8217;s the key point of patents &#8212; they&#8217;re a defensive measure, not meant to be a weapon against others. That&#8217;s what most of these new patents seem to be &#8212; an effort to scoop cash because someone had the wherewithal to patent a technique that was already well on the way to development, and not even something they were responsible for coming up with.<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the most recent (potential) offender, Balthaser Online. I loathe to immediately label them as the bad guy, but with the awarded patent, it&#8217;s not looking good. Why? Because Neil Balthaser, the former VP of Strategy for Macromedia, filed a patent in 2001 for &#8220;Methods, Systems and Processes for the Design and Creation of Rich-Media Applications via the Internet&#8221;. This was filed when Flash was already in its third version, so it was hardly a new idea. Balthaser just happened to be the first guy in the door.<br />
But maybe I&#8217;m being too harsh. Maybe I&#8217;ve been too jaded with the silliness of the <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=39838&amp;DisplayTab=Article">Eolas vs. Microsoft lawsuit</a> or the utter nonsense of the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1930636,00.asp">NTP vs. RIM lawsuit</a> (I mean, really guys &#8212; are you so callous about money that you&#8217;re willing to cripple communications for hundreds of thousands of people, bringing chaos to the upper echelons of Corporate America?) that I can&#8217;t see anything but ill intent. It&#8217;s possible that Balthaser got the patent to ensure that no-one else did, and will open that patent to everyone thus ensuring that all the developments in the internet since its filing will continue as they should, without impedence or fear that the financial penalty for innovation won&#8217;t prove efforts were for naught.<br />
Having looked at American Capitalism lately, though, I&#8217;m not willing to hold my breath.<br />
The short of this is that the USPTO does not represent the internet. Developments take place in parallel (and often in concert), building on the steps set down by others often not seen until years later (witness the sudden appearance of AJAX, despite the introduction of the core method &#8212; XMLHttpRequest() &#8212; years earlier by Microsoft). Patents filed by those keen only on reaping the rewards of others&#8217; labour serve only to cause problems and financial hardships for those trying to honestly make a difference (and a few bucks, of course).<br />
The USPTO should be restricted to allowing patents where there is proven effort to invent the concept, and <em>continue that innovation</em> to further the idea, market the idea, and do what the giants of the past did &#8212; such as Goodyear &#8212; and <em>earn the right</em> to own that patent. Not just be the first person to put their hand up.<br />
If the change doesn&#8217;t come, maybe I&#8217;ll file a patent for stupidity, so I can sue all the idiots in the world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass works hard. We know that from all the various nervous ticks we&#8217;ve developed over the years from working too hard.<br />
So you can imagine that when we play, we make up for the difference.<br />
There are two annual events in the Critical Mass calendar. The first is the Summer Event, which has been a staple since I started back in 2000. The other, a more recent edition, is the CMMYs (pronounced &#8220;see-emmies&#8221;). It&#8217;s our own internal awards show, showcasing the work we&#8217;ve done over the last year. It&#8217;s a combination of the Emmys, the Oscars, the MTV Movie Awards, and a car crash. Namely, that it runs longer than you think, but you just can&#8217;t stop watching it.<br />
During CMMY week, Critical Mass is a madhouse. Mostly because we import all of our offices to Calgary and still try to function. The Calgary office surprisingly can still accomodate all those people &#8212; well over 300 of them &#8212; and not have to share desks. Meeting rooms, on the other hand, are in much shorter supply. And that&#8217;s a problem when meetings become a priority because everyone&#8217;s here. And because it&#8217;s a prime time for 2006 planning.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m glad that this week is nearly over &#8212; the meetings have been murder, and I&#8217;ve not gotten nearly enough done. Next week, things will return to normal. I hope.<br />
The events of this week have been varied, but interesting. People started arriving Monday morning from the Toronto office &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t expecting people until Tuesday at the earliest. The Bistro was quite full at breakfast. Faces I&#8217;d not seen in quite some time (partly due to me leaving the Mercedes-Benz account) were a happy sight. And a lot of faces that I&#8217;ve never seen before.<br />
I used to pride myself on knowing everyone in the company. But there are just too many of them now. I think I&#8217;ll be lucky to know even half of Critical Mass. Half of that number I might know personally. It might be a small world, but there are lot of people in it.<br />
Tuesday was the Town Hall and Department meetings. The winter Town Hall is often &#8230; well, dull. Not because it&#8217;s all financial and organizational material. Not <em>just</em> because. It&#8217;s mostly because it&#8217;s not played up as much as the summer Town Hall, which has been the source of some absolute hilarity at the complete expense of anything business-related. So the winter session is a little harder to sit through.<br />
The Department meeting was also a little hard to sit through, despite the lubrication of having beer readily available. The major issue was how the Technology department will work at Critical Mass. We&#8217;ve reorganized a bit, and we&#8217;re now part of the Strategy group. This, I like. I like the idea that Planning will come before Design, and that Technology is a part of that planning. The trouble is, that&#8217;s not the way that Critical Mass has worked in the past &#8212; Technology has historically come after the Design phase.<br />
It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re objected to change, only that we don&#8217;t understand yet how it will all work. But that&#8217;s the thing &#8212; no-one has spelled it out in detail. And no-one will &#8212; you can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s just too many things to state to make it an effective piece of communication. But it&#8217;s the direction that matters, and it&#8217;s something we need to pay closer attention to. Agility and strategic positioning is what it&#8217;s all about.<br />
Wednesday was all about meetings of various kinds. Two of particular importance to me, however, were the Web Development meetings. First was a meeting of the Senior web developers. This is the steering group, the ones who set the best practices in the company, and guide the rest of the team in our daily work. For the last few weeks, we&#8217;ve been establishing our own internal standards. We&#8217;ve had the standards embedded in our culture for a long time, but never actually written down. Now that we have more than one production office, we need to get our act together.<br />
The topic of this meeting? It was important to have this specific meeting, given that all of our seniors were in the same place (except Colin, who got sucked away to a client visit in California). This was the sort of discussion that required everyone present. It&#8217;s a religious debate amongst developers, one that widely divides camps, and creates shouting matches. (Which is also why I bought beer, so we could keep it somewhat calm.)<br />
Tabs vs. spaces.<br />
For those of you in the programming field, you know what I mean. For those of you who have no idea what the big deal is, well, it&#8217;s hard to explain the passion that abounded about which standard we would use. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care. Or I didn&#8217;t until that meeting. As the arguments went along, I fell into line with Dennis&#8217; well-crafted argument to use tabs. Torin&#8217;s defence of spaces never really quite caught on for me, though it was also well-handled. Tabs won out.<br />
The next meeting was not as successful as I would have liked: the Web Dev Bru Ha Ha. Every so often, we try to get the entire Web Dev team out for a drink after work. It&#8217;s a chance to mingle and get to know one another. But despite having the entire team in the city, we got barely half of the team out. Sadly, or fortunately (depending on your view), it just means we&#8217;ll have to keep trying until we get it right.<br />
Thursday, yesterday, was the big day. Everyone was anticipating the big night. And we knew from the start that this was going to be something interesting, when spying the Brokeback Mountain poster taped to one of the meeting room walls &#8230; and then realizing that it said &#8220;Brettback Evan&#8221; and featured the faces of two of our IT wizards, Brett and Evan in place of Heath and Jake.<br />
One final meeting was the BU meeting &#8212; the Business Unit that we belong to. Our BUs are colour-coded, and contain one or more accounts depending on their size. Until a week or so ago, I was part of the Orange BU. That was until we found out that our newest client &#8212; for whom I&#8217;m the Technology Director &#8212; was a lot larger than we&#8217;d thought. Now I&#8217;m in the Gold BU. We&#8217;re still small, but we&#8217;ll be growing this year. But due to our compact size, we could easily squeeze into the upper floor of the Rose and Crown. We were back at the office just before 17:00 to get ready for the CMMYs.<br />
The CMMYs are a time for Critical Mass to play it up a bit. It&#8217;s also a time for us to look more presentable than usual. In fact, there&#8217;s even a dress code: No jeans, no running shoes, no hats. That&#8217;s it, so it leaves a lot of options open &#8212; no matter what your sense of taste is. Last year, it brought out guys in the stereotypically gaudy 1970&#8217;s powder blue tuxedos complete with the ruffled shirts. It&#8217;s a chance for Jerry, our Chairman, to break out his very dapper tuxedo. It&#8217;s a chance for people to dress up in ways they normally wouldn&#8217;t, and enjoy the change.<br />
Deciding that I&#8217;ve worn my wedding suit too often (it&#8217;s becoming a pattern), I opted for something a little different. I wore my kilt.<br />
Actually, it was my dad&#8217;s kilt. Custom-made in Scotland. It&#8217;s a heavy little bugger, but it looks great. The last time I&#8217;d worn it was at Cathy&#8217;s wedding. Back then, I didn&#8217;t like the kilt so much. It&#8217;s a winter-weight kilt, which means you bake in the middle of the summer. I was also a few pounds heavier, meaning I barely fit in it.<br />
I&#8217;m thinner now (thanks to Arthur), so wearing it isn&#8217;t such a burden. And being winter, it&#8217;s more comfortable. Well, almost. It figures that the first actual cold day since winter began in Calgary is the day I&#8217;m going to not wear pants. It was -35 with the wind chill.<br />
We all arrived at the Calgary Hyatt for 18:00 &#8212; the start of cocktail time. When Neil spotted me walking into the coat check area, he spied my hairy legs poking out from under my Morrison dress tartan, and immediately declared: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna know.&#8221;<br />
He was referring, of course, to the oft-mentioned fact: what do Scotsmen wear beneath the kilt? You&#8217;d be surprised how often I was asked that question. But only one person dared check: John. The sheep-shagging haggis stuffer was the only one bold enough to continue hauling it up. I don&#8217;t think he ever got a good look, thankfully! John and I have a long history, though &#8212; he was my account manager on my first project. I met him for the first time when I&#8217;d had to be sent down to Cincinnati to fix a problem on another project (see [[Live from Cincinnati]]).<br />
Dinner was served promptly at 19:00 &#8230; I think. I&#8217;d officially lost track of time by then. I was at the back of the room with my fellow technical cohorts, most of them Flash developers. The rest were web developers. I felt like the old fart at the table, and not just the fact that I&#8217;m older than the rest of them. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass nearly six years &#8212; only Natalia came close to my tenure. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass long enough to be able to remember the events coming up on the projection screen.<br />
(Incidentally, to the Critical Mass historian: the first town hall that took place at the Danish Community Centre followed by a visit to Ceili&#8217;s took place in 2000, not 1999 as it appeared. I know &#8212; I was there. I have witnesses to that effect.)<br />
Dinner was surprisingly good. I was worried that our meals would be &#8230; not terribly satisfying due to the banquet-style serving. But the Hyatt did an outstanding job of my steak. Certainly something worth praising, I think.<br />
Following dinner, we began the awards show. Every year, we strive to have someone worthy of being on stage, someone who can captivate the audience, while simultaneously being able to offer witty, sometimes slanderous quips. Who else but the beautiful Arif?<br />
The awards go for most risky project, ones with the most changes before it was complete, best integration, and so forth. Mixed in between the awards were short clips of video promoting our CMVPs, one of whom would be chosen as CMVP of the year. It&#8217;s a big honour &#8230; and a big cheque. I&#8217;d filmed some stuff for Torin&#8217;s segment. The best part was seeing how the video was edited into it&#8217;s final form. Quotes were intentionally taken out of reference, things spliced in such a way as to tell a story that no one person could tell.<br />
Also thrown in were two other special events. The first was a tribute to Jerry, our new Chairman of the Board. Jerry used to be the CEO, but we had a restructuring this year that put Jerry to the head of the heap. I&#8217;ve gotten to know Jerry a bit over the years, though I know most of my knowledge is courtesy of stories told by others. Though Jerry does tell a number of good ones, himself.<br />
The second was a tribute to employee #001. It was introduced by Darren, who believed himself to be #001. As the story goes, though, he found out that he wasn&#8217;t in fact #001. So he renumbered himself to #000. The one bearing #001 is Randy &#8212; our first financial wizard. Randy doesn&#8217;t say much, but he certainly did this time. And Randy didn&#8217;t allow himself to stay alone, asking up the other original few who are still with Critical Mass. It was time to celebrate one more thing:<br />
iPods.<br />
No, wait, sorry &#8212; that was afterwards. It was to celebrate 10 Years of Critical Mass. Ten years ago, Ted Hellard and Michel Clairo started a little CD-ROM firm. Today, we&#8217;re the top interactive agency in North America. A few people working out of a living room turned into a seven-office marketing demon with over 300 employees. I&#8217;ve been here over half of its life, and I think I&#8217;m going to be here for a long time to come &#8230; I hope.<br />
As a present to everyone who had helped Critical Mass get to where we are, everyone was given a gift: iPods. 30GB versions to the permanent employees, Shuffles to the term employees. I&#8217;ve already got a Nano, so this was icing on the cake. On the back is an inscription: &#8220;CRITICAL MASS Ten years and counting&#8221;.<br />
Brett won for CMVP of the year &#8212; deservedly so. The presentation was accompanied by the trailer for Brettback Evan, a parody of Brokeback Mountain. Every year, every meeting like this, someone creates a classic Critical Mass video. This was the CMMYs&#8217; contribution to posterity. It joins the class of &#8220;Arif Striptease&#8221;, &#8220;Dirty J&#8221;, &#8220;Luke&#8217;s Workout&#8221;, and &#8220;The Office Enforcer&#8221;. One day, I&#8217;ll need to get a DVD of all of these.<br />
We never all made it to Ducky&#8217;s. That had been the plan. But in typical awards fashion, we didn&#8217;t wrap up the show until nearly midnight. By then, it was clear we were better off staying at the Hyatt. I held out until about 2:00 before finally weaving my way home. I&#8217;m not able to handle the drive as well as I used to &#8212; I must be getting old.<br />
This morning was a little rough. My head hurt. Tylenol, an extra-cheesy omelette, a -25 degree walk to the bus stop to get to work (I left my car at the office so I wouldn&#8217;t drive home), and four mugs of jasmine tea corrected the queasiness.<br />
My throat hurts, and my voice is a good octave lower. That&#8217;s mostly due to yelling. As anyone who&#8217;s been around me after two beers and in a noisy environment knows, my ability to control the volume of my voice goes right out the window. I&#8217;m sure I deafened Ryan when I was encouraging him to be passionate about something he wants to do.<br />
Gary showed up at work in the same clothes as last night. He doesn&#8217;t fully remember everything. He wasn&#8217;t even sure if he took pictures (he did) or what happened to his jacket. People are calling in sick. Those here aren&#8217;t moving with the same vigour as usual. Pictures from last night look &#8230; interesting.<br />
God, I love this company.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, 14 February 2006, is being touted as the day people are to <a href="http://actionnetwork.org/sft/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=3738734">&#8220;break-up&#8221; with Google</a> (also <a href="http://noluv4google.com/article.php?id=801">here</a>). They&#8217;re to sever their relationship, their ties, their love for what is still the most dominant search engine on the internet. It might be losing its top place due to a drop in its relevance (word to Google&#8217;s engineers: you guys gotta tighten that baby up &#8212; MSN is beginning to beat you out), but its popularity has never been stronger.<br />
Which is part of the reason why people are trying to punish Google for censoring itself in China. It&#8217;s a backlash against the Big G to try and remind them of their &#8220;do no evil&#8221; mantra.<br />
It&#8217;s about the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard of.<br />
In recorded history, the actions of a group of people have instigated (either directly or as an end result of continued actions) a change in behaviour of an entity, be it the church, a government, or a company. The belief (no matter how ill-thought) is that by removing the traffic from Google&#8217;s engines, people will somehow force Google into removing the censorship in China, allowing the poor, huddled masses there to see all the material currently forbidden by the Chinese government.<br />
The problem isn&#8217;t that Google is censoring &#8212; it&#8217;s that people believe that <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">Google&#8217;s moral direction</a> somehow overrides the legality of operating in another country.<br />
Yes, Google is an American company. It follows all the laws and guidelines set within the United States of America. What most people seem to forget is that just because a company is based there doesn&#8217;t mean that it can behave the same way in every other country on the planet.<br />
The traditional Corporation (we&#8217;ll ignore that the internet exists for a moment) starts in Country A, defined by and operating under the laws that govern that nation. When the Corporation wants to do business in Country B, it can either do so across borders (when it is convenient and relatively painless), or it opens a subsidiary to acclimatize to the different conditions. Every country has a specific set of laws that are almost invariably different (not necessarily hostile towards) to the laws in the originating country. The subsidiary allows the Corporation to function internally with minimal changes, and having the subsidiary deal with the legal specifics.<br />
Even between the United States and Canada, there are legal differences. Although almost economically transparent to one another, there are sufficient differences to require significant treaties to allow the exchange of goods and services (witness the US/Canada Auto Pact or NAFTA). The laws that companies operate within are also different, which leads to having specific subsidiaries in Canada. Even companies like Dell and Microsoft &#8212; and yes, even Google &#8212; have Canadian-specific offices to handle Canadian-specific legal requirements.<br />
When Google wants to do business directly within a country, it needs to open an office. This is particularly important when that country is viewed as being a strong source of revenue. (Yes, folks, this is all due to money. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; or not, money is the root of all evil and money rules everything.) Such is the case with China &#8212; it is the next great revenue source for the search engines. Google just happened to be the first to knock on the door.<br />
China has very specific laws when it comes to information. Such is the reality of living within the confines of a oligarchy-ruled &#8220;communist&#8221; nation. You control the masses (and lest we forget that China has over 1.6 billion people) by controlling information. China allows a great deal of information through its borders (having been there, I&#8217;ve seen what is allowed) and offers its people a great deal of freedom.<br />
But to ensure that its society remains harmonious, there are aspects that are not allowed. Anything to do with democracy, freedom of speech, or anything that might incite revolt against the ruling party is viewed to be particularly dangerous. China has a history of particularly violent civil wars &#8212; even if the ruling party weren&#8217;t trying to save their collective butts, it would be a wise policy to allow gradual change rather than end up with an internal conflict on the order of World War I.<br />
This isn&#8217;t about China&#8217;s policies &#8212; this is about others having to recognize that they exist. Google has, much to the chagrin of others. Google has done what a lot of people now view as a violation of Google&#8217;s moral perogative: censored itself. It has done &#8220;evil&#8221;.<br />
There is an interesting allegory to this. There once was a garden. And in this garden grew a tree. The inhabitants of this garden were told never to eat from the tree. Yet they were inticed by a serpent &#8212; a representation of evil &#8212; to ignore what they were told, and eat the delicious fruit, and ultimately learned the horrible truth.<br />
The story of Adam and Eve is often used as a prime example of evil&#8217;s profits. And yet, if we consider Google to be the tree, for it does contain all the collected knowledge &#8230; who is the snake? It&#8217;s not China, for they want that knowledge to remain in the tree, away from those who would eat the tree&#8217;s fruit. Eating that apple is considered evil.<br />
I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s going to stir a few objections &#8212; how dare I consider the allegory to be even remotely equivalent to a company that chooses to side with an &#8220;evil&#8221; country! Like many things, the concept of &#8220;evil&#8221; is highly subjective. We westerners look down on other nations that do not provide the same notions of freedom. We do not see the same societal constructs that have existed elsewhere for centuries. We consider our enlightenment to be the only true way.<br />
If the recent weeks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy">Muhammad cartoons</a> have not yet taught westerners that absolute belief in our own superiority is a supreme fallacy, I don&#8217;t know what will.<br />
Every company, no matter what medium it exists in or what product or service it offers, must comply with the local laws of the country in which it wishes to do business. For Google to operate in China means it has to contend with the laws that govern China &#8212; that means removing content from their service that are in violation of China&#8217;s information ban. Regardless of how we view China&#8217;s policies, they are what will guide and rule whatever company cares to hang a shingle inside their borders.<br />
Lest we forget, though, it&#8217;s not just China. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1744845,00.asp">Microsoft got slapped by the EU for Windows Media Player.</a> Last time I checked, I didn&#8217;t hear the west complaining about that. In fact, we were encouraging the EU to fine Microsoft and force changes. This was just the EU enforcing the laws they have adopted, for better or for worse.<br />
And it&#8217;s not to say that Google has become wimpy, either. Remember when the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10925344/">White House demanded records on pornography searches</a> on their indexes? Google refused to hand them over. We lauded them for that. But it wasn&#8217;t because they knew they&#8217;d win the hearts of users. It was their policy not to hand over information that was in potential violation of the law. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; includes abiding by the laws they operate under.<br />
Google won&#8217;t be the only one. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/02/12/afx2519826.html">Yahoo&#8217;s following Google to China.</a> And they are also encountering the laws that have given Google so much trouble. The word &#8220;fight&#8221; has shown up, but it&#8217;s not a fight &#8212; it&#8217;s an adaptation. Yahoo, like Google, will need to consider (and probably will end up) censoring its content if it wants to gain the favour needed to earn money behind the Great Wall. And if <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/02/09/china.yahoo.ap/">China asks for information on one of its users</a>, Yahoo will comply.<br />
So perhaps its time for everyone to pull their highly enlightened heads out of the sand and look around. The world doesn&#8217;t end at North America&#8217;s borders. Things are different out there, and companies have to play by different rules if they wish to earn revenue in other nations. And it doesn&#8217;t matter what moral direction that company says it will follow.<br />
The idea here is to pressure China to change its policies by forcing companies to bring in western ideals. This is not a realisitic perspective. Companies will not force changes in an economy the size of China&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not feasible. Companies are too small, too insignficiant. And they know it. Only governments can inflict changes like the ones activists want to see. They want human rights brought in like those in the west. They want Tibet freed. Google can&#8217;t do that. Yahoo can&#8217;t do that.<br />
You want that kind of change? Get your government to change. They&#8217;re the ones who can influence change through trade sanctions, through changes in diplomatic behaviour. Only when political pressure is enacted will it be possible for change to take place. And China&#8217;s considerable economy is tough to overcome.<br />
Don&#8217;t punish Google (or Yahoo, for that matter) for complying with the laws of another country. Talk to your elected official. Lodge your complaints. Make your voice heard by your government. Only through them will the changes you want to see take place.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am a know-it-all. Both in the best and worst senses.<br />
I became one as a kid. When all of my friends were reading Hardy Boys or Lord of the Rings, I was reading through Time Life books, learning how the universe worked &#8212; from the formation of suns right down to the reproductive systems in humans.<br />
That was Mom&#8217;s doing, actually. She knew two things of my behaviour. First, that I read a lot. If we&#8217;d had the Encyclopedia Britannica, I would have read the whole thing, cover to cover. It&#8217;s probably a good thing that we didn&#8217;t, actually. The other thing was that I was nosey. I knew most of Mom&#8217;s good hiding spots for presents. (I&#8217;m sure Mom had a few others that I hadn&#8217;t even considered.) That was how Mom managed to sneak in a book that she was sure I would read.<br />
The human body made up as robots, all geared to explain sexual reproduction to kids. Sounds like a weird concept. The first time that I read the book, it didn&#8217;t sink in. Something just didn&#8217;t make sense. When I reread the book a few months later (Mom had since then removed the book from the &#8220;hiding&#8221; place to the bookshelf), it stuck. It didn&#8217;t fit with my world view at the time, so required some additional processing.<br />
My appetite for information, however, didn&#8217;t waiver. Mom got me another set of books &#8212; Time Life again &#8212; on Planet Earth. This covered pretty much every angle of Earth&#8217;s formation, behaviour, the things that make it up, and the things that live on it. Given that it&#8217;s Time Life, it&#8217;s not super-detailed, but it allowed me to get a decent grasp on plate tectonics.<br />
In Grade Eight.<br />
My English teacher believed that my parents had written the report rather than myself. At the time, I hadn&#8217;t understood the accusation, but would later realize what she was getting at.<br />
Jeopardy bored me. My family had a habit of watching Wheel of Fortune (which I couldn&#8217;t stand, then or now) and Jeopardy over dinner. If I didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the episode, I often came darn close. The Teen and College editions were laughable.<br />
In university, I made it a habit of taking a variety of courses &#8212; for interests&#8217; sake. I went in for Computer Science, came out with an English degree, and took courses from nearly every faculty along the way. Some because I needed courses other than my core ones, but others because they looked interesting. And I learned a lot.<br />
The internet has been my biggest provider, despite the risk of inaccurate (or completely false) information that is sometimes to be found there. The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is my latest obsession, and I regularly find myself consciously steering clear of it so I don&#8217;t become completely absorbed. That, combined with my 70 or so RSS feeds do a pretty decent job of filling my head full of often-useless crap.<br />
And believe me, I keep it pretty full. It got so full that I eventually reached &#8220;informational mass&#8221;, the point at which a person is no longer able to keep this information bottled up and feels the urge to share it with everyone else. Often at annoying or poorly coordinated times. I became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Claven">Cliff Claven</a>.<br />
Yes, my friends have called me that. To my face. In front of my family. Several times.<br />
I can&#8217;t help it! I&#8217;m sure that psychiatry would be well-motivated to investigate this mental illness if they knew how many people are afflicted with know-it-all-ism. Just imagine how many people must require treatment for the sake of their sanity, their marriages, or even their jobs!<br />
My job has been both a blessing and a curse for my know-it-all-ism. It requires me to know a lot to enable decision making, and affords me the chance to offer up information to help others. However, it means that I&#8217;ll frequently offer information that has nothing to do with the work at hand &#8230; such as the specific date the Romanov family was assassinated (16 July 1918) and that Anastasia didn&#8217;t survive as myth sometimes suggests.<br />
One of my ex-project managers, Nancy, even called me on one of my factoids:</p>
<blockquote><p>Geoff, do you actually know that, or do you just make yourself out to sound like you know?</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best part is that you&#8217;ll never know for sure.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the key to being a know-it-all: confidence. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you know something or not. You could be completely wrong about it. But you have to sound like you&#8217;re right, completely and without the possibility of fault. So long as someone is convinced that you know what you&#8217;re talking about (even if you&#8217;re way off), then you&#8217;re a trusted source.<br />
Oh, and you have to speak your mind. Often out-of-turn. When no-one asked for it. That&#8217;s also a defining point of a know-it-all.<br />
Take the case of <a href="http://ajjacobs.com/">A.J. Jacobs</a>, for example. He dedicated himself to the task of reading the Encyclopedia Britannica end-to-end under the guise of becoming the smartest person in the world. And then <a href="http://ajjacobs.com/content/book.asp">he wrote a book about the journey</a>.<br />
I mention this because I&#8217;m reading the book. I&#8217;m only up to P, but so far it&#8217;s been a great book. Especially for me since I really identify with A.J. Or should that be sympathize? Well, I suppose it works both ways. It&#8217;s a great read, though. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s for everyone, mind you, since you need to be a bit of a know-it-all to fully appreciate its humour.<br />
Even A.J., having read the Britannica, admits that you can&#8217;t know everything, and a lot of what you &#8220;know&#8221; depends on how well you can convince others. Take his brother-in-law, Eric, who tried to convince his own wife that a waitress serving them was not from a small town hear where his wife was raised, but in Eastern Europe. Needless to say, A.J. was quite pleased when Eric go trounced. And A.J. learned the secret of being a know-it-all.<br />
I try to manage my dissemination of knowledge, but I know full well that I periodically still sound like Cliff. Without the accent, that is. Or the postal carrier outfit.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate Starbucks.<br />
Not because the word &#8220;Starbucks&#8221; has come to mean anything so popular and prevalent as to find it on every street corner. Not because they&#8217;ve taken the idea of luxury coffee and turned it into a readily-accessible commodity. Not because they charge <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/content/opinion/2004/11/27/the-$5-coffee/">almost five dollars for a coffee</a>.<br />
I hate them because they stopped making Chantico.<br />
What is Chantico? I could use the superlative: &#8220;hot sex in a small cup&#8221;, but even that doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. So I&#8217;ll give you the actual definition: hot whole milk, ground chocolate, a bit of flavour, made really thick. It&#8217;s drinking chocolate. It&#8217;s like heating up a Dairy Milk bar and sucking it back before it resolidifies.<br />
It&#8217;s not for everyone. I know a few people who can&#8217;t stand it. It&#8217;s strong. Really strong. It&#8217;s like a kick to the head compared to regular hot chocolate. (Especially when you ask for a shot of peppermint syrup in it!) But to anyone who loves chocolate, it&#8217;s pure heaven.<br />
And incidentally, I&#8217;m not referring to people who like chocolate who say they love it. You don&#8217;t have an obsession for it. You don&#8217;t start drooling uncontrollably when you see a box of Lindt Lindors. You don&#8217;t go into convulsions when you enter a Bernard Callebaut store. The scent of quality dark chocolate doesn&#8217;t cause blackouts.<br />
I should join Chocolate Lover&#8217;s Anonymous. I know I should. But I can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t want to wean myself off of chocolate. When I see the episode of the Simpson&#8217;s where Homer daydreams that he&#8217;s in the Land of Chocolate &#8212; I <em>identify</em> with that! I think how wonderful a place like that would be! Damn the implications of malnourishment and tooth decay &#8212; it&#8217;s all about the gratification!<br />
That&#8217;s what Chantico is &#8230; or rather, was, for me. It was the little land of chocolate in a small paper container. I weep for the loss, as I know of no replacement for it. My life will likely change now as I embark on a journey to find that replacement. I will search high, low, in, out, up, down, forward, backward, under, over, through, and around every single place I ever happen to be, searching for a recipe, a scrap of knowledge, even a hint of a whisper that I might yet again experience the sheer ecstacy that is drinking chocolate.<br />
So if you do one day come across a poor, broken man on the side of the road who asks you for a chocolate bar, give the poor man pity. It&#8217;s not his fault. The chocolate made me do it.<br />
That is why I hate Starbucks.</p>

		<p>Wow. Long time no write, eh?<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how one&#8217;s life can change so dramatically in such a short period of time. Things that had once been hugely important become minor, and things you never imagined having a major sway in life suddenly start dominating every action and thought.<br />
I&#8217;m not going to recap the events of 2005 &#8212; at least not in detail. Suffice to say, a lot has happened. I went around the world. I got promoted. I got married. I moved into a new house. I travelled. I welcomed a new niece. I worked far harder than I had in a long time, and pretty much shrank off into a little world of my own.<br />
That&#8217;s what happens when you don&#8217;t try to balance yourself better. The only result of that is suffering. Not just yourself (or myself, as the case ended up being) but also those around you. It&#8217;s hard, and some of the decisions you make are not always wise ones.<br />
Because of the last year, I backed off of writing a lot. I tried getting back into it with more ranting (like that ever accomplished anything), and then decided I need to take my site in a different direction and started doing a photo blog. That was not quite a disaster, but I just couldn&#8217;t keep up to the schedule I had tried to set myself. The website takes a decided backseat to everything else. It has to.<br />
Ultimately, I became very dissatisfied with the way things were going. I was ruining a lot of things, mostly because I kept stewing over things not going the way I&#8217;d like them to. This website, believe it or not, was one of the key things driving me nuts.<br />
Spammers are a problem. I didn&#8217;t get into the site a lot, but when I did, I spent way too much time cleaning up the mess. As nice as blogging tools are, some things are just not needed. And apparently, those bonehead script kiddies out there haven&#8217;t figured out that comment spam doesn&#8217;t do anything other than piss off the administrator. You can only take so much garbage on Texas Hold&#8217;em poker sites before you finally go off the deep end.<br />
I decided to go back to my roots. Hand-coded. Hand-administered. Old school. But far less prone to problems, even with the extra work needed to do even a simple post as this one.<br />
So I&#8217;m back, and I&#8217;m hoping to stay around a little more frequently. Emphasis on the word &#8220;hope&#8221;.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Canadians are strange. I know &#8212; I&#8217;m one of them.<br />
In some places in the world, such as our oft-maligned (deservably or not) neighbour to the south, people vote for a person and the position/platform that they take in the course of presented themselves to the electorate. The fact that they belong to a specific political party is often inconsequential.<br />
We Canucks are a strange lot, however: We&#8217;ll actually vote out completely competant and capable people, or somehow magically organize ourselves nationwide to vote out a party in retaliation for things they&#8217;ve done during their administration. It&#8217;s our polite way of taking revenge.<br />
Canada took revenge on the Liberals. After a decade of ruling the country, we decided to give them the heave-ho in favour of the only other politically-viable party: the Conservatives. Thankfully, we collectively had the sanity to only give the Conservatives a minority government &#8212; the baby managed to hang onto the tub while we threw out the bathwater.<br />
Do I like the fact that the Conservatives are in? Not particularly. I don&#8217;t much like the right-of-right-wing idealism that has spun out of that group in the last couple of years. I didn&#8217;t mind the Progressive Conservative party back in the day. Periodically inane, yes, and were effectively decimated to two lousy seats following the Mulrooney era, but all-in-all weren&#8217;t that bad.<br />
Canadians have a short memory. People seem to forget that it was because of the Liberals that we have most of the social policies that we do today. Remember, if it weren&#8217;t for Trudeau, the state would have poked its nose into the bedrooms of the nation probably well into the 1970s. Following Mulrooney&#8217;s retirement from office (wisely chosen mere months before a federal election eliminated the PCs of official party status in the House of Commons) &#8230; anyone remember why?<br />
Oh, and anyone ever really notice that the dropped &#8220;Progressive&#8221; from the party name? That should be an indication of how willing the Conservatives are willing to look forward. The Conservatives are intersted in status quo &#8212; the one of years&#8217; past.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m in no way trying to absolve the Liberals of wrongdoing. There were serious violations of protocol, and people knew about it. At least internally. It wasn&#8217;t until the Gomery Inquiry that things came more to light. It was a mess. The ruling party was involved. And darn it, that just ain&#8217;t Canadian!<br />
Let&#8217;s ignore one of the more crucial facts: Not all the Liberals were involved in the scandal. In fact, most of the shenanigans took place with federal employees &#8212; people the electorate have no control over. People who might still be there. Certainly, if nothing else, the poisoned environment still exists. Things might have gotten quieter, but does it mean that the corruption has been purged? I&#8217;m willing to suggest it&#8217;s not.<br />
The part that worries me most of all this is how much we&#8217;re going to be set back. The Conservatives (so aptly named) are scared of anything that go against what they consider normal. They will do everything in their (albeit limited) power to take away rights bestowed to groups, takea way the legislation geared to making Canada safer and open, and abolishing systems we have come to depend on. Oh, and the child care thing? Harper &#8212; please take a lesson from Quebec. They&#8217;re the only ones who have this figured out.<br />
How long the Conservatives stay in the lead role remains to be seen. Minority governments generally don&#8217;t last long because before too long, they either make a mistake and are forced to set a new election, get overly cocky and want to hold an election to get more seats, or the other parties gang up and end up dissolving the house &#8212; and bringing about another election. I speculate they&#8217;ll play it safe as long as possible to stay in power as long as possible. Make enough good in-roads with the rest of Canada, and they might pull of a majority government.<br />
The next few years will be interesting, to say the least. And I sincerely hope it&#8217;s not a disasterous four years.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Minority governments are always a touchy thing. This is something the Americans have trouble with &#8212; in a two-party system, you don&#8217;t get minority governments, just slim margins. In multiple party systems (three or more), it&#8217;s possible to have a situation where the ruling party doesn&#8217;t have a majority of the seats in the legislative house. When that happens, fewer decisions can be effectively made, and the whole political process slows down even more than usual.<br />
And that&#8217;s a pretty darn scary thought, when you get right down to it.<br />
Seventeen months ago, that&#8217;s exactly what happened in Canada. We hadn&#8217;t seen a federal minority government for quite some time, mostly because people remember how successful the last one was. People tended to vote either for the Progressive Conservatives (now just the Conservative Party) or the Liberals. A few people would vote for the NDP (mostly in British Columbia, it would seem), or the Bloc Quebecois; but one of the Tories or the Liberals would usually run the House of Commons.<br />
Seventeen months ago, after a few rounds of Liberal governments, the Canadian population decided to get &#8220;strategic&#8221;. Every time this happens, it means a minority government. Oddly enough, this is what Canadians &#8220;want&#8221;, because it means we get a bit of a break of one party acting like they own the place. That means fewer decisions, and less rocking of the boat.<br />
Now, given, the Liberals were the ones boat-rocking. Normally, they&#8217;re pretty &#8230; well, dull. They do some nice stuff, they do some not-so-nice stuff, but they&#8217;re middle-of-the-road. They&#8217;re centre. They&#8217;re Liberals. But the whole <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/groupaction/sponsorship_inquiries.html">Sponsorship Scandal</a> really threw a wrench in the works, and brought the Liberals out as looking like the bad guys.<br />
Okay, yes, they did try to hide the facts. And the funds were being redirected back into the Liberal coffers. And they tried to deny it. And a couple of Liberal people were involved. Yeah, things aren&#8217;t all that rosey, when you start to look into it.<br />
So the leaders of the three major opposition parties (<a href="http://www.conservative.ca/EN/biography/">Stephen Harper</a>, Conservative Party; <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/bio/">Jack Layton</a>, NDP; and <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/fr/equipe_detail.asp?ID=58">Gilles Duceppe</a>, Bloc Québécois) banded together to take the Liberals out.<br />
Right before Christmas.<br />
Thanks a lot, guys. We really appreciate this. I mean, how much better could the holiday season possibly get now that we have to not only contend with the over-commercialization of a formerly holy Christian holiday (replete with way too many red-tag sales and far too much Kenny G&#8217;s &#8220;Greatest Holiday Classics&#8221;) than to also endure the intolerable jackhammer chatter of &#8220;vote for me or my opponent will ruin this country&#8221;.<br />
Yeah, there&#8217;s a cheery message for the season.<br />
Okay, while we&#8217;re on the topic, let&#8217;s look at a few things&#8230;<br />
The Conservative Party. Led by the unthinkable Stephen Harper. When the mere suggestion of same-sex marriage came up, the first thing he was happy to pronounce was that when he was elected, he would table legislation to have it removed from the law books. Now that he is looking at election square in the face, he&#8217;s actually pulled back a bit. Why? Easy &#8212; he&#8217;s got to look good to southern Ontario, the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, most of Quebec, and a good chunk of the Maritime Provinces who perceive him as a fanatical right-wing racist homophobic nutjob. Given some of the wonderful things that he&#8217;s said over the years (<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/s/stephen_harper.html">the silly and the stupid</a>, and while I hate to have a &#8220;they say, he says&#8221; thing going on, I rather like the Liberal&#8217;s idea for a <a href="http://www.stephenharpersaid.ca/">campaign against Stephen Harper</a>), how can we take this guy seriously? At least King Ralph has the history of being an alcoholic with which to pass of some of the strange things that he&#8217;s uttered.<br />
The Liberals. Been in power a few too many years, some would suggest. They&#8217;re not reliable, they&#8217;re dishonest, bla bla bla. Spotless record? Heck no. Name a political party in <strong>any</strong> country that&#8217;s got a spotless record. About as easy as finding a vegan in Alberta&#8217;s cattle country. Paul Martin&#8217;s regarded as the most credible of the leaders up for the top seat, but he only comes in at 34%. Why not more? Scandals do damage. Mr. Martin might think he did a good job keeps arm&#8217;s distance from the whole thing, but let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; there&#8217;s been some real shady things going on in the Ruling House, and given Paul&#8217;s neck-deep interest (remember that he was Finance Minister for a long time; you don&#8217;t hold a position like that and not know a few things) he can&#8217;t come out squeaky clean.<br />
The NDP. The Shiny, Happy People Party. The Things Are Always Perfect Party Even If We Don&#8217;t Really Understand What We&#8217;re Doing Party. Okay, maybe that last one was a little unfair, but generally speaking, the NDP haven&#8217;t done a particularly good job when they manage to get into power. Witness Saskatchewan, Ontario (for that brief period in the 1990s), and British Columbia. The NDP generally have the right idea, but their implementation stinks. Ironically enough, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Rae">former Ontario premier Bob Rae</a> was one of the best politicians Canada has seen since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> &#8230; but he only figured it out about a year before the NDP were all but laid waste in a provincial election. The Federal NDP are led by Jack Layton, a former Toronto city councillor. He was an able person who did a good job of representing his riding in the now mega-city. But that wasn&#8217;t enough &#8212; he wanted to represent Toronto in Canada.<br />
And that&#8217;s his problem. Just like Harper doesn&#8217;t understand anything outside of the conservative west, Martin doesn&#8217;t understand the west, Duceppe doesn&#8217;t give a crap for anything outside of Quebec (and probably not for Anglo Montreal, either), Layton doesn&#8217;t get anything outside of Toronto. Sure, he&#8217;s <em>been</em> outside of Toronto, but he doesn&#8217;t get it. He&#8217;s been there too long. If Jack&#8217;s to get any credibility, he needs to live in Truro, Campbellton, Churchill, Prince Albert, Yellowknife, and Kamloops for a few months each. Yes, Toronto is the economic hub of Canada, but as I&#8217;ve learned myself, there&#8217;s a lot more to this country than the corner of Yonge and Dundas. Is he a capable politician? Heck yes &#8212; he worked out a deal with the Liberals to push through a budget, with a few conditions of his own. That&#8217;s well-used power. Can he do that if it were only the NDP in power? Don&#8217;t hold your breath&#8230;<br />
And then there&#8217;s the Bloc. Do I really need to review these guys? Gilles Duceppe doesn&#8217;t care about the rest of Canada. All he wants is separation, and he doesn&#8217;t even understand why. It&#8217;s not because of French culture (if he believes that Anglo Canada is trying to wipe it out, he needs to live out in BC for a while, immerse himself in the Anglo society, then move back &#8212; then he&#8217;ll see how distinctive and wonderful it truly is). It&#8217;s not because of French politics (Quebec uses civil law, unlike the rest of Canada &#8212; and big surprise, it works just fine without any interference from anyone else). It&#8217;s not for money (Quebec is largely dependent on transfers from the Federal government, much of which comes from Ontario and Alberta). So what&#8217;s the big chip on your shoulder, Gilles? What do you like about the rest of us? We smell or something? Not like the Bloc could ever actually take over as the ruling party &#8212; because of their limited span, they couldn&#8217;t get enough seats to pull that off. And in all honesty, they&#8217;re about the best opposition party because they hate everything the ruling party does.<br />
The big cry is the sweeping change: Get the Liberals out, get us (&#8220;us&#8221; being one of the opposition parties at hand) in, and things will get better.<br />
But will they? Based purely on track record, the NDP would likely screw up the finances. (People say the Liberals already did, but they were the ones who brought the debt under control and have managed to actually produce surpluses.) There would be more programs, yes, but before long taxes would have to go up. The Tories would no doubt try to live up to their idiotic promise of reducing the GST &#8230; which would no doubt backfire once the coffers run dry due to all the cuts in taxes given to all their friends in business, or so history suggests. Oh, and then there&#8217;s that minor setback in equal rights as they squash all the progress we&#8217;ve made, but who would really notice that, any way? The Liberals would likely do status quo. But after over a decade of the same tune, do you really want to keep listening?<br />
Whoever ends up in power still has one minor problem: All that infrastructure that made the Sponsorship Scandal work? Still there. All the ineffiiencies? Still there. All the duct tape holding parts of our fragile goverment together? Still there. Voting out the ruling party doesn&#8217;t get rid of it. It doesn&#8217;t go away.<br />
So yes, we have ourselves a wonderful Christmas present: We get to think about all the problems we have with our Feds and try to make some sort of an educated decision that might somehow make our lives better.<br />
But we won&#8217;t. Fact is, we have no clear options. All of them have their flaws. All of them fail to see the forest for the trees. All of them fail to see past the political daycare centre that we elected them into, complete with same the squabbling, toy-hogging, paste-eating mentality we see in people one tenth their age.<br />
Better buy yourselves something nice for Christmas, folks. With luck, it&#8217;ll put you in a good enough mood to survive until late January.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Y&#8217;know, I used to believe that all the really shady governmental meddling always happened south of the border.<br />
Little did I know that our own government has been setting the stage to run things that we&#8217;d been taking for granted. I caught this first on SlashDot (news for nerds), which directed me to the appropriate article on the Toronto Star website.<br />
It&#8217;s quite freaky, actually. The short version of the story is that <a href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/">Canadian law enforcement wants near-direct access</a> to any information an Telecommunications Service Provider (TSP) might have regarding their users or the information their users transmit over a TSP&#8217;s systems. Without court orders and without having to inform the users. The TSP has no legal recourse but to cough up the goods or face fines and jail time.<br />
Awfully heavy-handed, if you ask me. This is not the usual behaviour of our spend-millions-on-useless-inquests governments. Someone&#8217;s been taking lessons from Uncle Sam.<br />
There&#8217;s a dual impact: not only are our rights to privacy completely ignored (and didn&#8217;t we just <a href="http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/index_e.asp">finish putting in privacy laws</a>?), but there&#8217;s a huge financial cost to the TSPs. Three guesses where that cost will be transferred to? Hello, $50 residential phone service.<br />
But where is this all coming from? The majority of it is the internet, which relies heavily on the TSPs for carrying the signals around the country. The internet scares many people, and it&#8217;s not just the grandmothers of the world who hear about the &#8220;web&#8221; and think of a room full of spiders. It scares legislators because the internet has long been out of the reach of the law.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say people haven&#8217;t tried. Regulation has had some effect in the United States. If you call <a href="http://news.com.com/RIAA+settles+with+12-year-old+girl/2100-1027_3-5073717.html">suing a 12 year-old kid for sharing music</a> files effective, anyway. Here in the Great Not-Quite-White North (all the snow is gone in Calgary), it&#8217;s been hands off. Or so we thought.<br />
It seems the hands were under the table, trying to tap into the phone lines. The government wants to know what we&#8217;re up to. Telephones, email, FTP transmissions, binary streaming data, even VoIP access. And since the internet also runs across cable providers, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if venerable televisions falls under the harsh gaze of the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">RCMP</a>, or even <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">CSIS</a>.<br />
The world changed, and we didn&#8217;t notice. We just went along for the ride. But the fear that the world is running unchecked is worrying some up on Parliament Hill, and they want control. Perhaps not direct control, as in North Korea, but they want to know when we&#8217;re not behaving.<br />
That&#8217;s all fine &#8212; we put governments in place so we don&#8217;t have to deal with the monotony of Big Picture hassles. That&#8217;s what governments do. Did we give them permission to read our emails? Without a court order, I think not.<br />
The legislation currently going through is wide-ranging, and it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty vague. They&#8217;ll be able to define it however they want, and the only victim is every single Canadian who dares to pick up a phone.<br />
I&#8217;m curious to know the underlying reasons. No doubt that fear is an issue &#8212; fear that the government doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on under the covers. Fear that the <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/">CRTC</a> can&#8217;t control what goes on over the internet. Fear that the telecoms might suffer as a result of VoIP.<br />
Technology changes at orders of magnitude faster than anyone in the government can comprehend. By the time you finish reading this, something else big will be on its way. Governments cannot expect to manage something like this without having the capability of understanding it.<br />
Perhaps that means we need a Ministry of Information. Yes, that rings of <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/combined">Brazil</a>, but that&#8217;s not my view. It&#8217;s a place where people can understand the technical infrastructure of Canada. What&#8217;s going on in those phone lines, and what kind of recommendations can be made to make sure that everyone plays nice, and we don&#8217;t impede upon the rights of others. (Like our privacy, for example.)<br />
The world won&#8217;t ever stop changing. That means we need to change. And so does the Government&#8217;s thinking.</p>

Ever heard of the Bavarian Purity Act of 1516? It&#8217;s also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>. Basically, it makes sure that your finely crafted German beer is as finely crafted as the price you paid.<br />
For almost 500 years, the law has stated that there would be only four ingredients in German beer: malt, hops, yeast, and water. That was partly for political reasons (e.g. bakers getting their wheat) but also to make sure that shifty brewers wouldn&#8217;t take shortcuts.<br />
Well, some bozo felt it was a good idea to challenge the law because he wanted to add sugar to his product. Never mind the half-MILLENNIUM of tradition and quality. Never mind that the Bavarian Purity Act is even used as a marketing gimmick for other beers around the world. No, sorry, we have to put sugar in ours and still call it beer.<br />
Jerks.<br />
So they managed to convince the courts, after a decade, that the Bavarian Purity Act should be weakened. One day, sadly, it will probably have no oomph at all, and will be merely a distant memory.<br />
So raise a glass of [insert favourite German beer here], &#8230; cuz it won&#8217;t be long before it won&#8217;t be just &#8220;beer&#8221; anymore.</p>

Wow.<br />
The world is a lot bigger than one would expect. Sure, Disney says it&#8217;s a &#8220;<em>Small, Small World</em>&#8220;, but trying going around it sometime. And I don&#8217;t mean by plane &#8212; go around it by surface. It takes a lot longer, and you&#8217;ll see a lot more.<br />
Biggest surprise in the whole trip? Reverse culture shock. Didn&#8217;t see that coming, I tell ya. After seven weeks of blocking out all other languages to concentrate on the rare blips of English (signage and speech), arriving in San Francisco about overloaded me. Ouch.<br />
The Bow River is flooding. The main highway was renamed. And those are the only two things we knew about on the road. Adjusting back is going to take some time&#8230;</p>

		<p>The last time I was in Japan (a little over a year ago), I&#8217;d wanted to go to Nara. I&#8217;d quite a bit about it, but just hadn&#8217;t gotten the chance to go. So when we planned this out, and happened to be spinning through Japan on our way home, it was a very fortunate happenstance that both of us wanted to be there.<br />
Nara, as it turns out, is a very neat little city. Make no mistake, this is most definitely no town. But it doesn&#8217;t feel large. At least, if you&#8217;re within the &#8220;walled&#8221; portion. (I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s an actual wall, but that&#8217;s what it looks like on the maps we&#8217;ve seen.)<br />

		<p>Tokyo is a wonderful city. Even in the rain. Despite a delayed start (we were up late &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t help that Chris and I yak a lot), we soon found ourselves in Ginza, walking through the mist-like rain in search of not much except yarn (Amy&#8217;s got a project she&#8217;s trying to finish).<br />
We went through the sweet electronic sanctity of the Sony Showroom [insert drool marks on the screen here], then over to the Apple store (four floors of pure industrial design nirvana), before crossing Ginza dori in search of, well, food. Amy spied a small sign that led us down an alley barely wide enough for us to walk, then down a set of barely-marked stairs into a basement restaurant that served some darn fine raumen, and some pretty funky dumplings.<br />
