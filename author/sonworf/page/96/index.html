	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve gone clubbing in Tokyo, and lived to tell about it.<br />
It&#8217;s an odd statement, I know, but allow me to explain.<br />
Chris and I didn&#8217;t have any real set plans. In fact, I didn&#8217;t really know what we were going to do until about 22:30, or so, when Chris came back and woke me up (stupid jet lag).<br />
The plan was to go into Tokyo to Shinjuku station, where we would head over to a club for a VJ party. I had no idea what that meant, but it sounded interesting. Of course, there is always a catch &#8212; and you might have already guessed what it is.<br />
Yep, the trains. Because the ones to the outlying areas stop at midnight, if you go into Tokyo to go to a club or see a late concert, you&#8217;re there for the rest of the night. Tokyo clubs have adapted to this, though, and are open until very late &#8230; or very early, depending on your point of view.<br />
Scott called us around 22:00 with most of the details we needed. However, we also needed to be on the train &#8230; pretty much right when Scott called us.<br />
With a bit of haste, we grabbed the 23:35 train from Yotsukaido to Chiba. There, we transferred to the 23:50 train to Tokyo &#8212; probably the last one of the night. Most people got out of the train by the time we arrived in Tokyo station, but there were still a few left. Once there, Chris navigated the rats nest of directional arrows and track numbers to find the Mitaka Line (I think that&#8217;s what it was called), which would take us to the opposite side of the city. This was where we found find Chris&#8217; friends.<br />
Well, almost. We arrived at the station where we would transfer to a fourth train, taking us right to where we needed to be. Problem: the trains had stopped for the night by the time we arrived. Many people who had missed the trains themselves were now camped out on the station floor, awaiting first service in the morning. For us, it was taxi time.<br />
Taxis in Tokyo are a little strange. You generally don&#8217;t open the door &#8212; the driver does remotely. I&#8217;m not entire sure why that is, but it&#8217;s probably something to do with being sanitary.<br />
Chris was on his cell phone. Not talking, but receiving messages from Scott on directions and names. This was how Chris directed the taxi driver to our location.<br />
The cell phone, particularly with younger people, is the single most important form of communication in Japan. Everyone has one, and you see them everywhere &#8212; especially on the trains. At least half the young people, especially those riding alone, will be engrossed with something on their phone, usually for the entire trip of wherever they&#8217;re going.<br />
(Scott had an interesting point of view: the phones have their pros and cons, but the cons are mostly superficial. Most likely, it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re status symbols and have to be updated frequently.)<br />
The taxi dropped us off at the station we would have gone to, were the trains running. We would be met by Chris&#8217; friends, who would walk us to the club.<br />
We didn&#8217;t have to wait long, them appearing on the staircase from an overpass moments after we returned from a quick run to a convenience store.<br />
It was Scott and Masame (a woman). Scott is another English teacher who lives in Narita city. He&#8217;s been here four years, and shows no signs of ever moving back to Ottawa. He seems to be having far too good a time to consider going anywhere.<br />
We went up the stairs and down a road that for a moment made me think we were in Scarborough. Of course, the traffic on the left side of the road, signs I could barely read, and the constant blur of Japanese cars reminded me constantly that we were in other country.<br />
It reminded me of something Keith Black had said our the group of us who went to the Soviet Union in 1989 (see [[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Introduction|Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union]]) &#8212; &#8220;Smile, you&#8217;re in another country!&#8221;<br />
At the time, none of us understood or really appreciated what he was trying to say. Fourteen years later, I find myself repeating that to myself constantly. Not because I need to smile, but because I understand.<br />
The first club was the smallest club I&#8217;ve ever seen, not even three times the size of my (rather small) living room. Along the wall across from the door was the bar, the wall next to the door featured the VJs. Next to the VJs were some small couches, and the opposite wall was the receiving end of their projector.<br />
The projector was what made them VJs. They&#8217;re not VJs in the sense of MuchMusic or MTV VJs &#8212; here, it&#8217;s video in the sense of how DJs spin music. Instead of music, they mix images and short snippets of video. The resulting output doesn&#8217;t really make sense, but is meant to compliment the music. It&#8217;s something that I can see hitting North America soon.<br />
I met Chris&#8217; friends, most of whom were very nice. Masame spoke the most English, the rest very little. Miyuki (Scott&#8217;s girlfriend) speaks none at all.<br />
Smile, you&#8217;re in another country!<br />
We stayed at the club until around 02:00, when we departed for another club. Tokyo is littered with small clubs &#8212; all you have to do is turn down a small alley and you&#8217;ll find one. They&#8217;re in small store fronts, basements, pretty much anywhere you can pack in at least 20 people.<br />
The next one, Mix, was in Aoyama, very close to Shibuya. It took us a moment to get the right place (Miyuki ran up and down the sidewalk a few times talking on her cell phone before we finally found it), but went in. The sign on the door read: &#8220;Open 22:00 to Close&#8221;.<br />
It was small, about 2-3 times the size of the last club, but it was quite packed with people. The cover to get in was about 2,500 yen (about CDN$31), but that also included two drinks (which is all I had while there). Covers to clubs are very expensive here in Tokyo, but if you go to the right place, the price is reasonable. The club featured the DJ from Tokyo Number One Soul Set, which probably added a bit to the price.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how fast time can fly at a club like this. The music was amazing. I know a lot of people who&#8217;d be very jealous if they knew what I&#8217;d experienced. There&#8217;s nothing like being in a small space with two professional DJs, a literal wall of speakers (including the most powerful bass I&#8217;ve felt in years), and (pardon the term) the most phat tunes I&#8217;ve heard spun live yet.<br />
Being one of perhaps four non-Japanese in the place, and probably the only one who didn&#8217;t speak Japanese, you&#8217;d probably think I&#8217;d have a hard time fitting in. But meeting people here is even easier than in Canada.<br />
One person I met goes under the name Ricky. He&#8217;s been training for eight years to be a champion boxer &#8212; though to look at him, you&#8217;d never know. Ricky&#8217;s English wasn&#8217;t that strong, but we still managed to have a conversation about each other, including ages (he&#8217;s 28), occupations (though I needed Chris to translate as I couldn&#8217;t think of a way to say simply what I do), and talked about Tokyo and what I should see and do.<br />
Language is something that I&#8217;ve become acutely aware of. And I&#8217;m not referring to the native language &#8212; I&#8217;m referring to my own. Most of the Japanese I&#8217;ve met here do not understand the intricacies of English, so explaining things the way I normally do doesn&#8217;t work. I need to chose my words very carefully so that I&#8217;m not introducing words that they would definitely not know. It&#8217;s not like speaking to a child who doesn&#8217;t have a grasp of language, it&#8217;s thinking like someone who&#8217;s learning another language and has at least a basic understanding of a language, and building off the vocabulary they already have.<br />
Our group gathered together about 05:15 and headed out into the early Tokyo morning. The sun had already started its rise. It was very peculiar to walk from a dark room into the light. Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around (like going to see a movie in the early evening and walk out into darkness).<br />
We wandered down the street in search of something to eat. Miyuki didn&#8217;t wander so much as she veered around, the others trying to keep her from steering herself out onto the road. Scott ended up piggy-backing her for a while.<br />
Somewhere inside Shibuya (the neighbouring district), the group split in two. Half went for noodles, the other half to First Kitchen for &#8230; something that sort of resembled the first meal of the day. Somehow, a bad hot dog and deep-fried battered red bean paste molded in the shape of a fish doesn&#8217;t really strike me as all that nutritious.<br />
There had been a great temptation for us to stay in Tokyo and tour around. But Chris was fast falling asleep, and I was beginning to be not too far behind him. And so we began our trip home.<br />
Scott and Miyuki took the train back to Narita. Masame and one of the other women drove home, while Nobu drove Chris, another woman whose name I can&#8217;t remember, and myself back to Yotsukaido (they all lived in the area).<br />
The drive back was interesting, to say the least. Tokyo is a labyrinth of streets and highways. The highways are all raised, and snake around the skyscrapers in tight paths, like a ribbon strung around trees in a forest. One minute we were far away from Tokyo Tower, the next right next to it, and I couldn&#8217;t figure out how that had happened.<br />
I was enthralled with the passing city. It&#8217;s one thing to take the train (which we did in the dark, so I didn&#8217;t see anything, anyway), but entirely another to see it by car &#8212; especially from a raised highway.<br />
Slowly, the massive skyscrapers gave way to low-rises. It became possible to see just how far the city goes. It looks like southern Ontario &#8212; stretching out forever. You cross massive rivers and can see small, traditional houses, even the odd shanty.<br />
Chris slept the whole way. I just had to place faith in our driver, because I had no idea where we were. In fact, when we finally arrived in Yotsukaido, we came in from a direction that I didn&#8217;t think was possible to come in from.<br />
Chris and I returned home for some sleep, crawling into be around 08:00. We would continue our day a little later&#8230;<br />
&#8212;-<br />
We woke around 13:30, when the phone rang. It was a friend (though I don&#8217;t know who). We rose and began our second part of the day. First order of the day, a quick run to the bank for Chris to get some money, and then off to Chiba.<br />
Transactions here are all in cash &#8212; aside from credit cards, most things are cash. It&#8217;s not uncommon for someone to have 50,000 yen or more (roughly $625) in their wallets at any time. The Interac system we&#8217;ve come to depend on so highly in Canada does not exist in the most efficient and technological country in the world.<br />
I&#8217;ve done the drip into Chiba so many times now that I don&#8217;t look out the window anymore. I actually feel like I&#8217;m beginning to fit in here. The language doesn&#8217;t bother me anymore, the fact that I&#8217;m a gaijin doesn&#8217;t concern me. I can see why Chris has had so little trouble being himself.<br />
Chiba station was busy, but it only took us a few minutes to find our way out. We were heading for Parco, one of the major shopping centres in Chiba. But first, we were going to hit Yodabashi Camera. But not for my sake&#8230;<br />
May 5th is Chris&#8217; first anniversary of engagement to Kazume. He wants to give her a gift. Originally, he was thinking a bracelet, but he knows that Kaz would like a camera so she can take pictures. This is probably one of the best camera shops outside Akehabara in Tokyo.<br />
You name it, they got it. Cameras I&#8217;ve never seen or even heard of. My personal favourite was a tiny little thing &#8212; a 2.0 megapixel Sony you could fit in your pocket along with a large wallet. It was perfect for Kaz. Heck, I&#8217;m thinking of one for myself!<br />
After the camera shop, we wandered into an arcade &#8212; more advanced than the one I&#8217;d been into the first day I was here (see [[My Trip to Japan, Calgary to Yotsukaido|my first day in Japan]]). Time Crisis III, Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, and a game where you have to be a DJ and play with both hands on a split screen at amazing speeds. Things we haven&#8217;t seen in Canada yet.<br />
We went to Parco next. Chris quickly decided that the camera was best &#8212; the jewelry wasn&#8217;t really cutting it for him. That said, we hit the mall, going to the hobby shop first to look at (what else?) Japanese toys. Surprisingly enough, there are a large number of ones from North America, too.<br />
A floor down, we met one of Chris&#8217; friends. In Calgary, Chris had the ability to meet people anywhere, including stores. Chris knew almost the entire staff of the A&amp;B Sound downtown. He&#8217;s not quite like that here, but this particular girl he knew only from this store. She spoke very little English, but Chris was more than able to carry out the conversation in Japanese.<br />
Both quite hungry from lack of food, we felt it was time for lunch. Next to Parco is a little restaurant called Freshness Burger (yes, you can giggle at the odd use of English syntax). It&#8217;s fast food, but like all Japanese fast food, only made when you order it. I had a very tasty nemimiso burger (essentially a miso patty with lots of shredded raw onion).<br />
While we ate, Chris received a message about a party that night at the home of Seiko, Chris&#8217; head manager. (We&#8217;d known about it from before, but we needed to RSVP.) We were to get a ride with Naome, another one of Chris&#8217; managers.<br />
First, we needed to hit a bakery. Chris wanted to bring something with us &#8212; never show up empty-handed. This meant a trip to Mitsukoshi, one of the other malls in town. Mitsukoshi is much higher-end than Parco. Parco would be like Sears or the Bay &#8212; Mitsukoshi is that fancy boutique mall where all the stores are like Louis Vitton, Tiffany of New York, and where the &#8220;food court garden&#8221; has the legendary $50 melons.<br />
(For the record, you can get melons in regular stores that don&#8217;t cost that much.)<br />
Returning to Parco (where we were to meet Naome), we got drinks at the Starbucks and waited. We didn&#8217;t wait long &#8212; Naome showed up not much later. From there, we went to the Tower Records in the mall.<br />
One thing about Parco that will throw off North Americans is how the mall is laid out. It is a mall, though it looks like a standard department store. The mall is divided into areas, most without defined walls. It allows easier passage, but can cause confusion because you&#8217;re not used to it.<br />
Chris and I listened to music while Naome tried to find the album she was looking for. Apparently, all she new was that the band had three members. She didn&#8217;t know a song or album name. Pick a country, and there&#8217;s always someone like this&#8230;<br />
Finding Naome&#8217;s car became a treasure hunt. She couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where she&#8217;d parked. It took a few minutes, but we eventually found her car a couple of blocks away. Then came the fun part as she tried to negotiate her way to Seiko&#8217;s. Even with a navigation system, Naome got turned around more than once.<br />
Before we could leave the downtown area, Chris&#8217; phone rang. It was Charlie, another one of the teachers. He and his girlfriend were at the station, and were coming to Seiko&#8217;s. Naome turned the car around and we went to pick them up.<br />
Naome&#8217;s little car was barely big enough to fit the five of us. Putting two large North American men (Charlie and I) does pose a few size problems. Mind you, I don&#8217;t think I can fit five people in the Mini, so I&#8217;m hardly one to complain.<br />
Don&#8217;t ask me how we got to Seiko&#8217;s house. I haven&#8217;t a clue. There seems to be no such thing as a straight road in Japan &#8212; they all weave in and out all over the place. Eventually, we arrived at a quiet little complex.<br />
Seiko is 50 years old &#8212; though she looks barely 35. (Miyuki, Scott&#8217;s girlfriend, is 32, though looks 16.) Sometimes I wish I were born Japanese &#8212; it&#8217;s the ultimate anti-aging device.<br />
Seiko&#8217;s house was small &#8212; not much bigger than my own (though I didn&#8217;t see the upstairs). She had prepared a Japanese buffet for us. I found out the reason was because this was in celebration of Naome&#8217;s 31st birthday, coming up this Thursday.<br />
The meal consisted of picked root salad, sliced ham (or pork, I&#8217;m not sure which), octopus salad (very tasty), bread, a sushi roll, and rice cakes. The diversity was quite interesting.<br />
I&#8217;m extremely thankful for the opportunity to attend the party, because it gave me a clear picture of what a typically Japanese meal is like. Simple, but with a number of items that we simply don&#8217;t see in North America. Luckily, I&#8217;m not the picky eater I used to be &#8212; I ate everything that was made available.<br />
That includes something called natto. Seiko and Naome found out I&#8217;d never had natto before, and wanted to see what I thought of it. Natto is a fermented bean that is usually mixed with other foodstuffs (though there are people who probably eat it on its own). It&#8217;s usually quite sticky, fairly bitter, and the texture is generally not what most westerners would enjoy.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t eat it. Luckily, Seiko and Naome were very generous in preparing it, making it far more palatable to my more delicate tastes. I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily eat an entire bowl of natto, but I wouldn&#8217;t be adverse to it.<br />
Cake and Earl Grey tea marked the end of our evening. By that point, I was quite tired, the remnants of the night before having caught up to me &#8230; and probably with the last of my jet lag.<br />
Naome drove us back to our respective places in Yotsukaido (we had expected just to be taken to the train). We were dropped off at the 7-11, barely a two-minute walk from Chris&#8217; apartment. I was asleep within minutes of hitting the tatami mat.</p>

For starters, I awoke after 10:00, the long day previous having sapped pretty much all my energy. Kaz was still here, but preparing to leave for Toyohashi. I needed a shower, and badly,<br />
This was my first Japanese shower. Western showers are tall things, often allowing you to stand vertically while cleaning. In Japan, the shower is a small, open tub in a well-tiled room that has a shower head mounted to the wall.<br />
Japanese flats, or at least Chris&#8217;, has no running hot water (there is cold water). All hot water comes from a small water heater that sits right next to the tub. It feeds hot water as needed.<br />
It was then that I realized the things I had forgotten for this trip. Phone numbers aside, I had also managed to forget shampoo and conditioner. I don&#8217;t think my scalp will have too much trouble with this humid climate, so hopefully, I&#8217;ll be alright.<br />
Kaz left around 11:30, leaving Chris and I to kill a little time until 13:30, when it was time for Chris to go to work. Today, he taught a class in Narita. (Chris teaches in several places, including here in Yotsukaido &#8212; this just happens to be roughly in the middle of his various teaching gigs.)<br />
I would go the opposite direction, to Chiba City. Yes, I was there last night, but I wanted to see the city in the daytime. So Chris entered one platform, and I went to another. Chris looked perfect at ease waiting for his train. I felt a little &#8230; odd.<br />
I&#8217;m finally understanding what it feels like to be the only person of a particular race in an area. Since arriving, Jan is the only other Caucasian I&#8217;ve actually met. Today, I didn&#8217;t see a single other non-Japanese (not counting Chris).<br />
It&#8217;s actually neat in a way &#8212; it&#8217;s a slight special feeling, but at the same time, no-one really seems to care. It&#8217;s kind of like: &#8220;oh, look, a strange gaijin&#8230;&#8221; and I&#8217;m forgotten within a few steps.<br />
In fact, the only longer glances I got were from the school girls. And no, this is not a fantasy come true.<br />
I do need to make a note of this, though. Japanese school girls pretty much meet the stereotype we&#8217;ve seen in the west: the uniforms, the giggling, and the really creepy sexuality that either their completely innocent of, or completely aware of (and you have no idea which it is). Suffice to say, I saw one girl eating an ice cream cone and &#8230; well, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve not yet forgotten.<br />
Chiba doesn&#8217;t look much different in daylight than it did at night. The biggest difference were the throngs of people &#8212; far more than last night. Of course, it was also a weekend (it&#8217;s Saturday), so it might have also been weekend trips to the semi-big city.<br />
I wandered around a little, trying to follow the route we&#8217;d taken last night, only in reverse. I missed a turn, though, and ended up with a longer walk. Not that I minded.<br />
I snapped pictures as I wandered around: the monorail and its tracks, the canal it runs overtop of (and the fish that swim in it), city streets, cars, and people &#8212; specifically, a guy dressed in a frog suit trying to entice people to enter a pachinko parlour.<br />
Along the way, I decided to visit Parco, a local department store In many ways, Parco reminds me of The Bay or of Eaton&#8217;s. Lots of small boutique-like areas with each floor dedicated to a specific need. The prices were about right in line with what you&#8217;d expect in Canada.<br />
I refrained from buying anything. This is for two reasons: One, I need to look around a little more, first. Second, I have very little money. This is due to lack of foresight on my part. I have no traveller&#8217;s cheques. I had assumed, rather foolishly I might add, that I could use my bank card here to obtain Yen directly. So far, I have yet to find an ATM that can access the North American networks. And I haven&#8217;t set up my credit cards to allow funds withdrawals.<br />
To anyone coming to Japan for a visit, remember to bring either traveller&#8217;s cheques or a healthy amount of yen. Getting access to the funds you need from your back without a lot of trouble is, well, a lot of trouble. In fact, after two days, I get the distinct feeling I&#8217;ll need to go into Tokyo to finally get out some cash.<br />
I found my way back to Yotsukaido without too much difficulty. After taking a couple pictures of the train station, I headed back to Chris&#8217; flat to rest a little while before going out to take more pictures. I decided to watch one of Chris&#8217; movies (Blade II) and take a little nap. Chris woke me a bare half-hour ago (it&#8217;s now 20:45), having fallen asleep on this futon.<br />
The loose plan now is to go to something called a &#8220;VJ party&#8221; in Shibuya, one of the districts of Tokyo. The catch? If we go, we&#8217;re there until 05:00 at the earliest &#8212; the trains don&#8217;t run after midnight.<br />
I want to go &#8230; I just hope my body is ready for this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It hasn&#8217;t been that long since my last outing, but it&#8217;s time again for my next great adventure. This time, I&#8217;m leaving the continent for the first time in almost 14 years &#8212; I&#8217;m going to Japan.<br />
Chris is staying there another year, and I&#8217;m going to take advantage of that by going out and visiting him. It&#8217;s been far too long since the last time I saw my best friend, and I shudder to thing that it&#8217;ll be at least another year before I&#8217;d see him again.<br />
This won&#8217;t be a cheap trip, that&#8217;s for sure. This will probably put me so far into debt that I&#8217;ll be lucky to leave Calgary, let alone travel anywhere. But hey, if you only live once, then you&#8217;d best darn-well live it!<br />
I&#8217;m currently sitting in Seat 47A of my Boeing 747-400, awaiting the departure of our plane from San Francisco Airport. I sit here with a mix of excitement and fear. Excitement for doing something new and unusual, but fear of the unknown. I don&#8217;t know what I will see, or how everything will unfold.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why I sense fear at these sorts of things &#8212; I love a challenge and I love adventure. I suppose it&#8217;s an autonomic response &#8212; my subconscious telling me something, I suppose. But I&#8217;m not going to let it stop me &#8212; not when there&#8217;s something new to explore!<br />
&#8212;-<br />
We&#8217;re still about six hours from landing. I haven&#8217;t been on a flight this long since I visited the Soviet Union in 1989. This flight is considerably longer for me &#8212; and a little more daunting. The Pacific Ocean is a lot larger than the Atlantic.<br />
All the blinds in the plane are closed, and most of the lights turned off. Most of the people are sleeping, even though it&#8217;s late afternoon. (I&#8217;d be getting off work in about 10 minutes were I still in Calgary.) If I do open the blinds, all I can see is ocean and cloud. No ships, no land.<br />
Travelling like this is a little odd. For all I know, I could be in a virtual simulator of a plane. When I enter I&#8217;m in San Francisco, and when I exit I&#8217;m miraculously transported to Tokyo. Mind you, I&#8217;ve always found air travel like this.<br />
The flight is mostly empty. I have an entire row to myself, as does the man in the row ahead of me. There is no-one for two rows behind me. I don&#8217;t know if this is normal for these flights, but considering United Airlines 837 runs New York &#8211; San Francisco &#8211; Narita &#8211; Seoul, I&#8217;d think there&#8217;d be a few more people here. Maybe it&#8217;s fears of SARS or of flying during the waning days of the Iraq war. I don&#8217;t know, but having this much space to myself is almost as much a luxury as first class.<br />
It&#8217;s a long way to Japan yet, and I&#8217;ve still got a lot of daytime ahead of me.<br />
&#8212;-<br />
I faded in and out of sleep over the course of the flight, trying desperately to adjust myself to arriving in mid-afternoon Tokyo. Even the idea of drinking as much as possible in hopes the alcohol would put me out didn&#8217;t help. (For the record, I didn&#8217;t ever get drink, but I did have two beers in succession.)<br />
I woke from my third rather fitful nap about two hours out of Narita. All I could see was ocean, cloud, sky, and a really big freakin&#8217; wing. The third movie of the flight, &#8220;Two Weeks&#8217; Notice&#8221; was just finishing. (We&#8217;d already seen &#8220;Clockstoppers&#8221; and &#8220;Star Trek: Nemesis&#8221;.) The second meal service was about to begin &#8212; I&#8217;d had teriyaki chicken the first time, so I went with the non-chicken option: a very tasty three-cheese pasta.<br />
Half an hour before landing, all we could see was cloud. The plane soon descended into the thick white cover, and everything vanished from view &#8212; I couldn&#8217;t even see the wing.<br />
For about 20 minutes, we bobbed through the clouds. Outside, the clouds went from absolute pure white to a medium gray. I looked down out the window, hoping that I&#8217;d see something through the haze.<br />
Slowly, shapes peeked through. Then the clouds peeled back like a movie dissolve to reveal the Japanese countryside. Rice fields, highways, country paths, small farms, collectives &#8212; it was exactly as I&#8217;d imagined.<br />
The flight arrived about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Pulling into the terminal, we deplaned and found our way to immigration. Narita is a big airport &#8212; it&#8217;s a long way away from the gate I came in at.<br />
The Japanese immigration process, according to the video we saw on the plane, works like this: You enter through a series of health inspection booths, then through immigration. After that, you find your bags, and then go through customs. It looked pretty straight-forward, though I had two reservations. First, I&#8217;m Canadian, and these SARS fears could detain me. Second, I didn&#8217;t have Chris&#8217; address in Yotsukaido, which meant I might have trouble going through immigration.<br />
The health inspection booths were closed, so we went right through. As I passed, I saw a sign asking residents of certain cities worldwide to go to the Health Inspection Office before going through immigration. Toronto was on the list.<br />
Immigration was only half-open, but the line was quite short. In about 10 minutes, we went through the line and it was my turn to convince the officer it was safe to let me into the country.<br />
&#8220;What address are you staying at in Yotsukaido?&#8221;<br />
I did my best to look completely sheepish and explained that I&#8217;d completely forgotten to bring the address, and the phone number (which was asked for immediately after). She looked at me, at the passport, at the embarkation form, and them back at me. Stone-faced. I wasn&#8217;t nervous &#8230; yet. But then she stamped the passport, the form, and welcomed me in.<br />
My bag was already waiting, so all I had to do was grab it, take off the plastic bag, and huck over to the customs line. It went something like this:<br />
&#8220;Are these all your bags?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Do you have anything to declare.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No, I do not.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Thank you, welcome to Japan.&#8221;<br />
Kaz was supposed to be waiting for me, but wasn&#8217;t there yet. Luckily, the arrival area is quite small, so there was little chance of me missing her. Instead, I just leaned up against a wall and waited.<br />
After about 30 minutes, I started getting worried. Was Kaz here and missed me? (I was afraid I wasn&#8217;t going to remember what she looked like.) I thought about calling her or Chris. Problem: no phone numbers. I didn&#8217;t have either Chris&#8217; house number or his cell number. I didn&#8217;t have Kaz&#8217;s number. I didn&#8217;t have Chris&#8217; address. Basically, if Kaz didn&#8217;t show up, I was going to have some trouble.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say I was entirely screwed. Worst-case scenario, I&#8217;d call Tamara back in Calgary, and have her pull Chris&#8217; number from my cell phone, and check my email to see if Chris had sent any cell numbers.<br />
&#8220;Geoff!&#8221;<br />
Kaz appeared from out of nowhere, and suddenly, I felt a lot better. We grabbed the bags and started working on getting to Yotsukaido. Right after a quick bathroom break. While Kaz made use of the facilities, I grabbed a quick drink of water from the fountain. I had a Homer Simpson moment:<br />
&#8220;Mmmm&#8230; foreign water&#8230;&#8221;<br />
The train to Yotsukaido left at 16:00, about an hour from when Kaz found me. Having time to kill, we went to have a coffee &#8230; at Starbucks. (I swear, you can&#8217;t get away from the place!) Although I have to say, I didn&#8217;t really mind &#8212; I wanted to see how different it is. The interior is a spitting image, save for the Japanese on the menu. The sizes are smaller than North America (a good thing) and the hot chocolate tastes a little different. But nothing too drastic.<br />
We boarded the train around 16:50. This particular train was a local &#8212; although it does go all the way to Tokyo, it stops at most stops on the way. Yotsukaido is considered a local stop. It looks little more than a large subway train &#8230; just with more advertisements covering virtually every surface, and hanging from the roof.<br />
And we think we have it bad in North America!<br />
The train zipped through the countryside, heading towards the urban jungle that surrounds Tokyo. Slowly, the rice fields gave way to parking lots and shopping malls. At the Narita city stop, we joined another train before continuing our trip towards Tokyo.<br />
We finally arrived in Yotsukaido around 17:40, and disembarked from the train. Kaz immediately called Chris from her cell. We could already see him rounding the corner &#8212; the familiar orangy leather jacket bursting out from the surrounding cacophony of dark suits and dresses.<br />
I haven&#8217;t seen Chris since I took him to the airport nearly a year ago (see [[Chris Goes to Japan &#8230; the Second Time]]). It didn&#8217;t take long for me to feel like I&#8217;d only seen him last week.<br />
Chris took us to his school &#8212; barely a minute walk from the train station. It was a lot smaller than I&#8217;d imagined. Three stories, but barely had a footprint of 10 metres by 10 metres.<br />
In Japan, everything is vertical.<br />
Chris introduced us to his (somewhat eccentric) coworkers, including his managers and another teacher named Jan, pronounced &#8220;Yan&#8221;. (Jan is also Chris&#8217; next door neighbour.) He called my name as he walked down the stairs, and for a moment I thought he knew me from somewhere else. But it turns out he was just being a smarty-pants, hearing my name from higher up the stairs.<br />
Kaz, Jan, and I left Chris to his own devices and headed over to Chris&#8217; flat so I could drop off my (rather heavy) bag and explore a bit.<br />
The first exploration was just going to Chris&#8217; flat. Narrow streets, small houses with elaborate courtyards, cars that I&#8217;ve never seen before, and more vending machines than in all of Calgary. From there, the three of us headed to Mos Burger for something to eat.<br />
Mos Burger is the rough equivalent to a Japanese Harvey&#8217;s. They have hamburgers of many kinds (according to Jan, they&#8217;re more like meatloaf burgers). I had a rice burger (rice patties instead of bread buns) filled with seafood and vegetables. Extremely tasty.<br />
Jan had to return to work, so Kaz and I had to kill some time before Chris was available again. Kaz decided to show me around downtown Yotsukaido.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take long. It&#8217;s not very big.<br />
One thing of note was the toy store. It&#8217;s not like any toy store I&#8217;ve been to &#8212; lots of kitchy little things, mostly Japanese (for obvious reasons), but with a fair few North American things thrown in for flavour.<br />
Downstairs was a video arcade. It was a peculiar mix of new games we haven&#8217;t seen in North America yet, and games we haven&#8217;t seen for a decade. The arcades are smoky places, which is not particularly great, so chances are I won&#8217;t be spending too much time in them.<br />
One game of note was a Kodo drumming game, similar to Samba Di Amigo or Dance Dance Revolutions. Kaz challenged me to a game, which I did reluctantly. Although much more fair than North America (it cost a little more than a dollar, but we got three plays out of it), Kaz whipped my keister.<br />
When Chris got off work, we decided we&#8217;d go for sushi &#8230; in Chiba City. Yotsukaido is a suburb of Chiba, which is a suburb of Tokyo. Chiba City is a couple of stops down from Yotsukaido.<br />
Chiba City looks more like the stereotypically Japanese city &#8212; lots of lights, overhead monorail, the dark roads with lots of cars.<br />
We went into a sushi bar that used a long conveyor belt to move items around. We didn&#8217;t really use it, though, favouring instead to order directly. Well, Kaz and Chris ordered &#8212; I just ate.<br />
I have to say that, so far, sushi isn&#8217;t much different than in Canada. It&#8217;s very tasty, and there are certainly things we don&#8217;t have, but the biggest differences are in size (portions are a lot larger), the wasabi is very fresh, and the rice is warm. This is because the fish doesn&#8217;t have to be frozen first.<br />
Eating our fill (which wasn&#8217;t too much) we proceeded to wander about Chiba a little. We ended up (on our way back to the station) at a place called Erotikave, a bar where the featured item is a bottle of Beefeater Gin with a rubber dildo affixed to the top. Rather odd&#8230;<br />
There we met one of Chris&#8217; friends, Shinichiro. He&#8217;s a freelance photographer, and a very funny guy. That&#8217;s when I realized just how good Chris&#8217; Japanese has become &#8212; he understands most things told to him, and can hold himself very well in a conversation. He&#8217;s not too bad in translating, either.<br />
Suddenly, it was a quarter to midnight. We had to bolt out to catch the last train to Yotsukaido. It was supposed to depart at 00:01, but was there until about 00:20. It was packed. I almost expected to see the guys with the white gloves.<br />
Yotsukaido was quiet when we arrived. The flood of returning passengers disappeared quickly, and we walked in quiet back towards Chris&#8217; flat. At least until we heard a very loud voice down one of the alleys.<br />
It was Jan. He had been thinking about coming out with us, but had instead been caught in a meeting. Afterwards, he&#8217;d gone home to get drunk and watch &#8220;Last of the Mohicans&#8221;. We caught him on a run to the local 7-11 to get some orange juice for the impending hangover.<br />
Returning to the flat, we prepared for bed. Kaz is off back to Toyohashi tomorrow, and Chris has to work at 13:30. I just want to get some sleep.<br />
I&#8217;ve had a very busy day.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, it&#8217;s Easter time again, and that means a lot of family events out here in the great Canadian plains. The major difference this year is what sort of family events we do. In previous years, it&#8217;s been a massive dinner (or series of dinners). This year, we did something a little different.<br />
We moved Nana from Prince Albert to Calgary.<br />
This was a move in the works for a long time. Nana has been unhappy staying in PA. It&#8217;s a long way from most of her family, and her circle of friends gets smaller with each passing year. While she&#8217;s not showing any signs of slowing down, even at the age of 90, there is always a need to change gears every now and then.<br />
So on Friday morning, I ventured out to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house where I met up with my Uncle Mike (Aunt Brenda and my cousin Jen had gone out on the Sunday to help Nana finish packing). Mike, Maggie (their pet dalmatian), and I were following out with a moving truck. I was in for a long weekend&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve done the trip east in Alberta as far as Hanna (about two or so hours from Calgary). In fact, this is where I ended up chasing a train last year back to Drumheller. This time, however, I would continue east into Saskatchewan, through Kindersley, turning at Saskatoon, and then north to PA.<br />
It&#8217;s about an eight-hour drive. The last time I&#8217;d done an eight-hour drive anywhere was on my last road trip with Gerry (see 26 August 1997). I hadn&#8217;t driven for any major length of time through the prairies in a long while, and I was about to get a major refresher course.<br />
Out to Hanna, you spend a fair bit of time in the Badlands &#8212; not the deep Badlands, but the erosion does bring out the shapes and colours quite readily. After Hanna, it&#8217;s all prairie. Not as dead-flat as southern Saskatchewan or Alberta (or Kansas, for that matter), but it doesn&#8217;t take long to get lulled into a sense of &#8230; well, you fall asleep.<br />
I had a good excuse, though &#8212; I&#8217;d been out with friends seeing &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, at a midnight showing. The movie was great, but I didn&#8217;t get to bed until almost 02:00 in the morning. A half-hour nap in the truck, though, and I was able to continue the trip.<br />
Our first major stop was at Kindersley, which also marked our halfway point. Lunch, water and a walk for Maggie, and we were on our way again.<br />
I kept myself occupied (when we weren&#8217;t babbling about whatever came to mind) by watching for trains. The highway we were on roughly paralleled one of CN&#8217;s lines &#8212; the one between Saskatoon and Calgary, to be specific. Even with the long drive, I didn&#8217;t see a single train. I didn&#8217;t happen to notice a couple of abandoned railbeds, though.<br />
We popped in at the southeastern corner of Saskatoon, very close to the Saskatoon train station that the CBC 50th Anniversary train had stopped (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Saskatoon]]). We didn&#8217;t pass by the station, and came in at 22nd Street and Circle Drive. Ironically enough, I had seen the new interchange before my uncle (we&#8217;d almost become lost driving back and forth from the train), and managed to direct him through it.<br />
I&#8217;ve driven from the Saskatoon Airport to PA many times. But I didn&#8217;t recognize any of the sights. None of the towns, none of the locations &#8212; nada. The unfamiliarity was actually a great distraction, mostly because Maggie recognized it, and new she&#8217;d be getting out of the truck soon.<br />
We arrived at Nana&#8217;s apartment around 16:00, which is pretty good time, I gather. Piling out of the truck, we went in and prepared to start packing. It was all done. The only outstanding parts were to disassemble the bed, load the truck, and leave. That wouldn&#8217;t been until the following morning. Instead, we rested from our long trip.<br />
That night, we enjoyed the last meal Nana would cook in her kitchen. Turkey, a personal favourite. We celebrated Maggie&#8217;s 10th birthday (complete with ice cream cake), and entertained a small army of visitors who came by to see the family.<br />
The next morning began early. Following a short breakfast from McDonald&#8217;s, I disassembled the bed and we moved it into the van. Nana had sold it to a friend, but it had to go into storage until they could pick it up. Storage in PA means the basement of a legal firm.<br />
When we returned, we immediately proceeded with the remainder of the packing. First item up: all the big stuff, starting with the china cabinet.<br />
This is how I got the second injury of the day (Mike got the first one when a nail in the wall opened a rather nasty gash on his hand). We were loading the cabinet into the truck (on its side &#8212; the cabinet wouldn&#8217;t fit in vertically), Mike on the high end any myself on the low end. Only Mike had his end a little too high, and it hit the top of the van. The cabinet stopped, but I kept going&#8230;<br />
WHAM!<br />
My face collided with the bottom of the cabinet. Luckily, my nose cushioned the impact. But not before creating a rather nice semi-circular cut on my nose. It took a while for it to stop bleeding, and the end result is, well, let&#8217;s just say that when people ask what happened, I tell them I got into a bar fight in PA.<br />
It sounds better than getting whacked in the schnozz with a china cabinet.<br />
In under two hours, we packed up everything Nana was taking into the van. A quick vacuum, and we were ready to leave. I expected a slow departure. This had been Nana&#8217;s home for 27 years. But there was no hesitation for her &#8212; it was time to move on with living. It was time to move to Calgary.<br />
Our three-car caravan hit the road at about 11:00 &#8212; Aunt Brenda in lead with the minivan, myself following in Nana&#8217;s car, and Mike bringing up the rear in the moving van. (The order would change not too far out of Kindersley &#8212; Mike wanted to get back a little more quickly than we were moving.)<br />
The trip back was fuelled by a steady supply of Coke. There was no way I was going to cross the prairies solo without being fully awake. I&#8217;ve nearly fallen asleep at the wheel enough to know that if you have to, you drink caffeine constantly.<br />
Aside from stopping in Saskatoon (for a quick bathroom break), our only other stops were in Kindersley for lunch, and somewhere around Alsask so we could refill our drink supply.<br />
We arrived in Calgary around 20:00. My back was killing me. Nana&#8217;s car had been comfortable for about four hours, but the seats were never designed for long trips. I needed to get out and walk a bit. We had the opportunity, since we also had to empty the car and part of the van.<br />
Bidding farewell for the evening, I walked back to the C-Train station, went home, and about near passed out from exhaustion.<br />
We emptied both vans the following day, with assistance from Pam and Sean. Our larger Easter dinner also featured the newly-returned Darren from Thailand. But the pain of the previous days&#8217; work was hard to overcome. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s a trip we won&#8217;t have to make again any time soon.<br />
Which is good, &#8216;cuz I still have a buzz from all the Coke.</p>

		<p>It seems that good things do happen to those who wait. Surprisingly enough, that also applies to me.<br />
You may recall some weeks ago, [[The Hell of my job|I lamented Critical Mass&#8217; ability to see the need to promote from within]]. It wasn&#8217;t so much about me as it was about using the resources we had, and not stalling forever on putting people into open positions.<br />
I kept raising the red flag. I was, well, a kind of whistle-blower, but only in reminding management that we were rapidly heading for a serious problem if we didn&#8217;t fill the position that I knew needed to be filled. I bugged Allard, and I bugged Cory. I wanted to make sure that we would have some sort of movement on the issue.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have officially become mobile. Today, I picked up the keyboard for my PDA, and am able to create my log entries wherever I am on the planet.<br />
And have an electrical socket to recharge the batteries. (Minor detail.)<br />
Wait a second &#8230; you probably have no idea that I have a PDA. Actually, I&#8217;ve had a PDA since 1996 &#8212; an Apple Newton. It was given to me by my boss when I worked at Arkipelago in Toronto. When I left, my boss told me to keep the Newton.<br />
I used it for a couple of more years, but it slowly fell out of favour with me, mostly because it wasn&#8217;t as convenient as I would have liked. The major issue was size &#8212; the Newton is a size of a thinnish brick. Weighs about as much, too.<br />
I did without a PDA for years. For the last three, most of my notes were written just like everyone else&#8217;s &#8212; on notepaper. The more notes I wrote, though, the more likely I was to forget things. Finally, upon taking over the Web Development team on Mercedes-Benz, things finally got too much.<br />
I take a lot of notes, and can sometimes get lost in details &#8212; no different than anyone else. I can&#8217;t allow myself to forget too much, though, lest it impede my job. I finally decided a PDA which could sync itself with my daily schedule was what I really needed.<br />
Research. Anything that&#8217;s gonna cost me more than $100 requires research. I had a set of requirements that I needed to fulfill. One was the need for handwriting recognition. I didn&#8217;t want to learn a new alphabet &#8212; like the Palm systems force you to do. I also wanted something that would synchronize with my calendar. That brought me to looking mostly at Pocket PCs.<br />
These things run on Microsoft software. That I&#8217;m not particularly thrilled about, but I have to accept the fact that to get what I need, I sometimes have to make sacrifices.<br />
After about three months of research (periodic, not continuous), I came to rest on two models: the Dell Axim X5, and the Toshiba e330. The Dell was the superior model for functionality and expandability, but was quite a bit larger. The Toshiba was smaller, but more limited. About equal price.<br />
It finally came down basically to a coin toss. The coin was tossed the night I replaced my watch battery &#8212; the store (Battery Plus) had a Toshiba. I nearly closed the store from all the humming and hawing. It came down to a demonstration period.<br />
According to the clerk, I had two weeks in which to decide if the PDA was what I needed. During that time, I could do whatever I wanted. So long as I didn&#8217;t damage the unit, I could bring it back for a full refund if I felt it wasn&#8217;t for me. It hasn&#8217;t been two weeks yet, and I&#8217;m sold.<br />
As the saying goes: so far, so good. Well, almost. When I first picked up the keyboard today, I couldn&#8217;t get it to work properly. Naturally, my first impression was that it was defective. Not wanting to retain a defective piece of equipment, I decided to pay Staples a visit (that&#8217;s where I bought it).<br />
I didn&#8217;t immediately ask to return it. My first initial thought was to check and see if, just perhaps, I wasn&#8217;t using it correctly. (Hey, it&#8217;s possible.) I got the feeling the clerk had been through this before, and promptly asked if I&#8217;d installed the software.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t even aware the keyboard had additional software. It stood to reason, though, that if the appropriate driver wasn&#8217;t installed, some of the more advanced functions of a keyboard might not work.<br />
Frankly, I don&#8217;t consider the enter key to be an advanced function, but I had to give it a shot.<br />
Whipping off to the office, I pulled in the PDA and inserted the CD into my desktop computer. A moment later, the software was installed. A test of the keyboard revealed that nothing had changed. A little puzzled, I hunted for some setting that might shed a little light on the problem.<br />
It turns out you have to enable the keyboard before you can use it. Doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me, but hey &#8212; if it works, then great!<br />
So I now have an almost completely portable website content-creation machine. Now if I can just figure out how to hook my camera into this thing&#8230;</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2003/03/2003-academy-awards-review/" rel="bookmark">Review of the 2003 Academy Awards</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Normally, around this time of year, I rant about the really dumb decisions the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science makes when awarding their own. Normally, it&#8217;s because they give Oscars to those who &#8220;deserve&#8221; the award, not those who&#8217;ve earned it.<br />
Not this year. This year, I actually have to praise them for making the hard choices.<br />
Last night, I convinced Tamara and her friend Todd to watch the Oscars. Didn&#8217;t take much &#8212; all I had to say was that &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221; was up for Best Documentary. That was enough in Tamara&#8217;s books to watch the rest of the ceremony. We missed the beginning of the show, but came in just as the awards were beginning.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s get most of the nitty-gritties out of the way. Best Animated Feature Film could only have been Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s &#8220;Spirited Away&#8221;. Having seen all the other nominees except &#8220;Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron&#8221;, there was but one choice. Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Chris Cooper and Catherine Zeta-Jones) gave me no reason to argue (though I might have preferred John C. Reilly in &#8220;Chicago&#8221;). &#8220;Chicago&#8221; scooped most of the primo awards, but considering the competition, that wasn&#8217;t all that surprising.<br />
But the night was a rollercoaster of surprises. Unlike previous years where the winners were always predictable, this series seemed to play to the underdogs and renegades of the industry. Adrien Brody winning Best Actor for &#8220;The Pianist&#8221; threw a lot of people &#8212; I was expecting Daniel Day-Lewis. (Not that I&#8217;m arguing with the choice.) Eminem taking out music heavyweights like &#8220;Chicago&#8221;, U2, and Paul Simon was extremely welcome (although the guy who accepted could have least had the decency to wear something better). The Best Original Screenplay went to a foreign film, &#8220;Talk to Her&#8221; &#8212; an Oscar rarity. And despite all the controversy, Roman Polanski won the coveted Best Director.<br />
Nothing was more surprising, and more pleasing, than hearing &#8220;Michael Moore, &#8216;Bowling for Columbine'&#8221; being read out. Both Tamara and I cried out in joy. Frankly, I thought Moore&#8217;s chances of winning were virtually none. Heck, I was shocked that he was even nominated! (Though I had a personal note never to watch the Oscars again if they didn&#8217;t nominate the movie. I guess someone listened to me for a change.)<br />
If you&#8217;re wondering why I was shocked about the nomination, you obviously haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;Bowling&#8221; or know who Michael Moore is. The guy is possibly the single most politically-charged firebrand in the States at the moment. (Even previous Academy Awards where Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon made statements barely even come close to what Moore did.) In &#8220;Bowling&#8221;, he asks a lot of hard questions, though finds it almost impossible to actually get them answered. He even confronts Hollywood heavyweights Dick Clark and Charleton Heston. Both come out looking a lot dirtier as a result. Heston takes a cinematic beating, however, retreating from Moore&#8217;s questioning by merely walking away.<br />
For those insults, I thought Moore&#8217;s changes of a nomination were nil. Okay, so he gets nominated &#8212; no chance he&#8217;ll win. The institutionalization of Hollywood won&#8217;t allow it. I would kill for a video tape of the production booth when &#8220;Bowling&#8221; won. The producers probably dove immediately into recovery mode. Because as soon as the standing ovation ended, and the quick thank-you was done, they knew that Moore&#8217;s political views would turn the heat up inside.<br />
Hell of a way to get a ratings boost, though.<br />
So the speech was barely cut short (Adrien Brody actually managed to get an extension, but finished his war speech far more tactfully than Moore&#8217;s), but the point was made. I think that&#8217;s all Moore really wanted to do. I don&#8217;t think he returned for the rest of the evening. Mind you, after his speech, producers might have just avoided showing him again. Steve Martin (the host) joked that Teamsters were helping Moore into the trunk of his limo. It was Moore&#8217;s first Oscar, and my guess is that it&#8217;ll be his last. Something tells me, though, that he won&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
I want to thank the Academy, for doing the right thing for a change!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long time, but I&#8217;ve gone back to school.<br />
The last time I took a class (see [[Why I Don&#8217;t Want to be a Technical Writer Anymore]]), it was for work. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything I didn&#8217;t already know, and I wasn&#8217;t really all that happy about it. This time, I&#8217;m taking something I have (some will say) far too much interest in, and (so far) have been really happy with. What is this wonderous education that I&#8217;m receiving? What is this subject in which I&#8217;m so engrossed?<br />
I&#8217;m going to Steam School.<br />
Okay, you can stop groaning now. Yes, this is related to trains. But not in the same over-the-top manner many seem to expect from me. (Either I&#8217;ve set far too many precedents, or people seem to expect a lot.) It&#8217;s actually an Antique Steam course, which is something I need to take so I can start my safety training for steam boilers.<br />
Why steam boilers, you ask? Remember my girlfriend? (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]].) Well, she needs more people trained to maintain and operate her. There&#8217;s a lot of work involved with running a steam locomotive, especially one with a boiler the size of 6060&#8217;s. And with the bulk of our society getting older every year, we&#8217;re in a pinch to make sure our newer members (e.g. me) have the necessary training.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; the course I&#8217;m taking now doesn&#8217;t even come close to qualifying me to even getting me in the cab while the locomotive is running. As with all things, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Once I&#8217;ve obtained this permit, then I can start working towards my Class 5 permit. That will, at least, get me in the cab during operation. Then it&#8217;s a matter of time and training before I can write my Class 4. I need a Class 4 to operate 6060&#8217;s boiler &#8212; in other words, apprentice to be a fireman. (It&#8217;ll be a number of years before I can be an engineer.)<br />
The class met at Pioneer Acres, a museum in Irricana, about 45 minutes northeast of Calgary. The village of Irricana is small, only about 1,000 people. It was likely once a railway town (the CN mainline &#8212; formerly Grand Trunk Pacific&#8217;s &#8212; to Edmonton runs through Irricana), but has since become little more than a small farming community. The village is surrounded by vast acreages.<br />
Our instructor was late, caught in the snow where he lives. Although a chinook and the onset of spring has pretty much wiped out the snow in most of Alberta, some parts are still in a deep freeze. No-one seemed to mind too much, though. For the $100 fee, a large number of us are having the fees covered by employers or our respective museums and historical societies. It gave us a chance to get to know eacy other a little better.<br />
The instructional material is &#8230; well, not so much in-depth as it is cohesive. Sounds a little odd, I know, but allow me to explain. Although I haven&#8217;t spent a huge amount of time with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, my education started the day I showed up in Warden (see [[Reunion with Steam Locomotive CN 6060]]). Sometimes it&#8217;s just someone telling me the name of a strange blob of cast iron. Sometimes, it&#8217;s telling me how it works. If I&#8217;m really lucky, I get to see it in pieces. However, none of it really seemed to make sense.<br />
The course I&#8217;m in is primarily aimed at safety. Steam engines (stationary boilers, traction engines, and locomotives alike) are all very dangerous. Even a stationary pressure vessel with pressures as low as 20psi can explode with disasterous consequences. 6060&#8217;s boiler runs at 260psi. As you can guess, safety is covered repeatedly during the session. The safety isn&#8217;t so much for us (though that is important), it&#8217;s mostly for the public. No steam engine would exist today were it not for the public wanting to see it operate. They&#8217;re far too expensive to own and operate without funding. So with the crowds we expect come the rules needed to operate them.<br />
Over the last two days, I&#8217;ve received a very clear picture of how certain elements of a steam boiler operate. Most of them to me were textbook concepts. Our instructor make sure that the ideas that once seemed so simple were carefully explained. Luckily, we have several in the class who can explain things a little further. The SAIT instructor even managed to fill in the missing bit of information that finally cleared up how a steam injector operates. (Of course, having some knowledge of physics and thermodynamics actually does come in handy.)<br />
I still get strange looks from friends and coworkers whenever I tell people about the things I do in my spare time. I guess most people expect that I would work on a computer all the time. With my job being close to the leading edge of computer technology, I guess I prefer having a hobby that has nothing to do with computers at all. There&#8217;s a certain amount of relaxation that comes from working with something that predates the electronic age. Something that has no knowledge of microprocessors (the federally-mandated radio notwithstanding), no cares about lines of software code, and no relation whatsoever to the mass-produced garbage of our era.<br />
It might weigh more than 23 times the average city bus, but our nigh 60 year-old toy always seems to lift off the worries of my little world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last October, I bade farewell to my newly-made friends from the CBC Train (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Halifax finale|5 October 2002]] and [[Touring Halifax, Part 1|7 October 2002]]). Since then, I have only talked to them over email and phone. It&#8217;s not the same as being there in person. And I&#8217;ve missed a lot, too &#8212; I get emails from some of them telling me about events and run-ins with the crew. Living out here, I feel pretty separated.<br />
So imagine my excitement when I saw a note from Angela informing me that CBC (specifically Angela and Tracy, who handle CBC Newsworld) were coming to Calgary for two nights of free documentaries. All she asked was that I tell a few people.<br />
I figured about 300 would be enough.<br />
I arrived at the Glenbow Museum at about 18:40, well before the 19:00 start time. Angela and Tracy were holding the inner doors open, and greeting people as they arrived. Simultaneously, it felt like only a moment had passed since I&#8217;d seen them last, and a lifetime.<br />
We talked for a while at the door, I stepping out of the way of arriving visitors. But soon it was time for the movie, and I wanted to go find a seat. That wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; the theatre was mostly empty. Although I had tried to tell as many people as possible, it can take a bit to get Calgarians to go out and do something, even if it is free.<br />
The documentary was &#8220;The Hockey Nomad&#8221;, the filmed version of Dave Bedini&#8217;s &#8220;The Tropic of Hockey&#8221;. (Dave Bedini is the rhythm guitarist for the Rheostatics, and a self-proclaimed hockey fanatic.) A couple years ago, Dave had travelled the world looking for hockey. He&#8217;d found things like a tribe in remote northern China, a national team in Mongolia, rumours of a rink in the Amazon, and things that to even the most aware North American hockey afficianado would sound peculiar.<br />
Such was the case of this movie. Dave and his camera crew visited three places: Ciuc (pronounced &#8220;chuck&#8221;) in the Transylvania region of Romania, ice rinks in the United Arab Emirates, and Ulan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia. He came to do one thing: Play hockey. Dave is a great story-teller, and even a subject like hockey (which can make even the most avid player roll his eyes) was completely fascinating. The story was compelling, and all the while featured a Canadian perspective.<br />
Afterwards, Dave came down to answer questions of the audience, and of a local broadcaster who had his own set of questions to pepper around. Questions were plenty, and the answers interesting. Soon, it was 21:00, and time to wrap things up. I walked over to Tracy and Angela in an effort to see if maybe they wanted to grab a coffee and have a quick chat. They countered with an offer to tag along with their group.<br />
We headed first to Saltlik, hoping to get into the lounge. Completely full, we opted for the James Joyce, just down the road. Tracy, Angela, and I were soon embroiled in our past. I felt kinda bad, though &#8212; they&#8217;ve already been through this with the others in Toronto. I have not. The only person out here is Enza, and I haven&#8217;t had time to get together with her for a chat.<br />
For a time, it almost felt like we were in some dark corner of a bar in the middle of the prairies. (Okay, we *were* in a dark corner of a bar in the middle of the prairies, but that&#8217;s beside the point.) I could have sworn that if I&#8217;d turned around I&#8217;d see Emma, Roger, Amy, Chris, Gerry, the Bills, the Robs, Neil, Jule &#8212; the whole crew doing what we did best: Be together as a team.<br />
It was all over too soon. Work calls as always, and I have early mornings at the gym. I left my part of the tab, and bit Tracy and Angela goodbye. Tomorrow is another movie, which I will unfortunately miss, and then they are off to Edmonton. It will probably be a while before I see them again.<br />
Though the saying may go: &#8220;The world is getting smaller&#8221;, it still seems far too large for me.</p>

		<blockquote><p>One is left with the horrible feeling now that war settles nothing; that to win a war is as disastrous as to lose one.<br />

<blockquote><p>War is not nice.<br />
<cite>Barbara Bush (wife of Fmr. President George Bush, and mother of current President George W. Bush)</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>A little over 12 years ago, I sat on the floor of my bedroom, watching in silence as the Gulf War burst into horrific life. I had been greatly saddened by the events, and greatly worried that our world was about to boil over into something much more serious.<br />
Imagine my shock when I sat down to watch a little television tonight. At 19:45 MST, the White House spokesman stepped onto the podium, saying that operations had begun in Iraq, and the President would be addressing the nation in 30 minutes. I had planned to do some work. Instead, I suddenly felt 12 years younger, and a lot more worried about the future.<br />
When Dubya went on the air a half hour later, I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what to expect. Except for armageddon, of course. Sure enough, through all the rhetoric, the message was quite clear: The &#8220;Allied Forces&#8221; (comprised mostly of America and British forces) had started their attack on Iraq. Exact details weren&#8217;t clear, but from what I could glean from CBC and CNN, the US had launched a barrage of missiles into Iraq as part of a &#8220;decapitation&#8221; strike, trying to take out Iraqi leadership.<br />
No matter how you try and make it sound nice, a &#8220;decapitation strike&#8221; sounds about as appealing as a root canal without painkillers.<br />
I can only imagine what we&#8217;ll see in the coming weeks. No commentator can agree on the details. Some think this will be a fast war, some think it will drag on for weeks, maybe months. Some say the Iraqis don&#8217;t have a lot to offer in the way of defence, others suggest that the Allied forces are outnumbered four to one. They are agreed on a couple of things: the US will spend countless billions to fund this war, and a lot of people are going to lose their lives. And it&#8217;s almost certain that the protests will begin tomorrow.<br />
There are two sad ironies in all this. First, the US can&#8217;t really &#8220;restore&#8221; democracy to Iraq. If they do, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that the electorate will vote in a follower of Islam, who would more than likely not bow to the will of the US. So Iraq will likely be run under a US-positioned puppet. At least until that person decides that they don&#8217;t want to listen any more, start doing their own thing, and bring the US military back in about two decades.<br />
Second, terrorism will likely increase as a result. No-one seems to have considered this part. Striking an Arab nation (even one run by a despot) will only succeed in angering neighbouring nations. Most certainly, this will raise the fur on Al Quaeda&#8217;s back. We can only certainly expect a reprisal at some point.<br />
It&#8217;s debatable whether the Iraqi people are going to be better off as a result of all this. Everyone seems to be speaking of them, but more concerned with their own self-importance and sword-waving. Only the United Nations seems to have a rational head on their shoulders. It&#8217;s too bad that legally, they&#8217;ll have no recourse against the US and UK. It&#8217;s all fine for the UN to crack down on a small rogue nation. But what do you do when two of your most powerful nations go renegade? The coolest heads seem to be coming from France and Germany: Two countries that know all-too-well the horrors of war and of occupation.<br />
I find it interesting that 65 years ago, another nation that opted to force its opinion and will on others started the &#8220;War to end all wars&#8221;. It was horror the likes of which no-one had seen before, and has brought us 60 years of stories (fictional and non).<br />
Actually, I take that back. It&#8217;s not interesting. It&#8217;s frightening.<br />
&#8216;Cuz we might end up with a front row seat.</p>
