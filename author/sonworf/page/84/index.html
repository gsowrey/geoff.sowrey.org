	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s something about driving like a maniac that makes for an interesting afternoon.<br />
I&#8217;ve been working on the Mercedes-Benz USA account for over four years now. In all that time, the closest I&#8217;ve ever come to a Benz are the ones I see driving down the street, or the ones we caught in the 2004 Calgary Auto Show.<br />
That is, until today.<br />
Exactly how this was worked out, I&#8217;m not sure, and I&#8217;m not one to pry. All I know is that it was not only well worth my time, but it was a heap of fun. Through an announcement we received from Thelton (likely arranged through Dan, who was on vacation until today), we found that Critical Mass had arranged to attend one of Mercedes-Benz Canada&#8217;s Ride and Drive events. This would give us first-hand exposure to the products we market.<br />
First, though, we had to go through a product seminar. Or at least that&#8217;s what we were told it would be. As it turned out, the presentation had become an episode of &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221;. The team was broken into five teams, each with a speaker. The speaker was to answer the question (or question the answer, in this particular case).<br />
In some cases, the questions were correct, and points awarded. In my team&#8217;s case, represented by Jason, they were not. Christine was kind enough to tally our final score at about -$10,000.<br />
Immediately following the &#8220;seminar&#8221;, we headed to our own personal vehicles (or other&#8217;s if we were getting a lift, which I was), and headed towards the southeast to Race City Speedway.<br />
The event was to start at 14:00, at least according to the website. It was already underway when we arrived around 13:30, although you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of people there.<br />
Race City Speedway is on the bare outskirts of Calgary. It&#8217;s been there for decades, and it shows. It&#8217;s not the most glamourous place: the main parking lot is ratty gravel, the dirt oval looks like it hadn&#8217;t seen a spot of paint in at least 10 years, the timing tower&#8217;s seen a couple of improvements probably in recent times, though iffy, and the bleachers &#8230; well, you won&#8217;t catch me sitting on them any time soon.<br />
That said, the Speedway has a quarter-mile track for drag racing, and a small course for road racing. It was where the quarter mile track starts that Mercedes had set up the entry tent. There we received our tags, denoting us as participants in the event. Exiting the tent, we found the collected inventories of the Hyatt and Lonestar Mercedes-Benz dealerships neatly lined up for viewing. (One of the salesmen would later tell me that Murphy arranged to have their dealerships swamped with customers on the two days the cars weren&#8217;t there).<br />
We were ferried down from the cars to the first of the three event pieces. We were either driven in an ML350 or an S500. I opted for the S500, since I have no interest in the M-Class. The S-Class is a nice line, though I know I have no hope of ever affording one.<br />
The Ride and Drive event is put on by Mercedes-Benz Canada as a sales gimmick. The idea is to go beyond the ordinary test drive, to get a chance to push the car to do the things you wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to do in a normal test drive. The event is actually run by a completely different company, though.<br />
There are three activities at the Ride and Drive: the slalom, the C55 challenge, and braking and handling. This was the order I did them in, too, though I initially had no peticular desire to go near the C55. Details on that in a moment&#8230;<br />
The slalom is a fairly simple thing. The course is a loop, about 250 metres long, and about 15 metres wide. You drive down one side, at a fairly brisk pace, getting to know what the car is like in sharp corners. The course then turns around to return the way you came, with a jog to the left, then back to the right, and a stop sign just before the start/finish line.<br />
Jen, our Product Specialist (she ran the &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; game), and I piled into a C230 Kompressor for the slalom. Jen took the first run, whipping in and out of the pylons that marked the edges of the curves, before whipping around the end, and bursting to the stop sign. We reached the end quite quickly, and we swapped. I don&#8217;t know how fast Jen did the course, but I think I ran it at about 50 km/h. I only hit one pylon. Others in our team were not quite so lucky, both Mabel and Jeff got lectures from the officials about their driving.<br />
I have to say that I have changed my opinion of the C230 Kompressor. I built the microsite for the Mercedes-Benz USA launch a few years ago. I came to loathe and despise the vehicle. I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it. I actually tried to avoid driving it, opting for the C230 Sport Sedan instead. But somehow, it worked out that I got a chance to experience a car that, until today, I hated. Funny how things happen.<br />
As we watched others running the course, Robb finished his run in the C55, proclaiming:<br />
&#8220;You guys have gotta try this!&#8221;<br />
The C55 activity wasn&#8217;t really &#8220;active&#8221;. The C55 is the top of the line in the C-Class line, running about CDN$75,000 base. It&#8217;s an AMG, which is Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s custom sport line. It&#8217;s powerful, about 360 horsepower. It&#8217;s not the sort of thing that Mercedes-Benz is going to willingly let us drive. So they brought in a professional race car driver.<br />
Jen, Marcie, and I donned crash helmets and piled into the C55, Marcie in the front passenger seat, myself behind Marcie, and Jen next to me. The driver smirked through his visor, and the car took off, probably due to the massive ACME rockets strapped to the sides. (Well, okay, it felt like it.)<br />
The course isn&#8217;t long, maybe a kilometre in total length. Of course, pulling corners at 160 kilometres an hour eats up track very quickly. The locks on the seatbelts kicked in almost immediately, and stayed engaged until we got to the end.<br />
The driver didn&#8217;t hit the brake once. Marcie cried: &#8220;Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod&#8221; as we rounded the corners, hanging on to whatever would keep us in our seats. The driver asked if we wanted to slow down. There was a doubly-defiant &#8220;NO!&#8221; from the backseat. Marcie was relieved when the ride was finally over.<br />
The next activity, just down the way from the C55 was hands-on: braking and handling. The task is fairly simple: drive as fast as possible towards a tight, short s-curve to the right, taking the turn while braking. Then come around for a straight-away run back in the direction we came in, running at full speed towards a stop sign, braking to the point where the ABS has to kick in. The idea, of course, is to find out what the cars handle like under the conditions.<br />
We had the choice of a C230 Sports Sedan, the S600, an ML350, and an E500. When I found out that the C230 had a manual transmission, I couldn&#8217;t resist the chance to give it a whirl. Scott (from our Research and Analytics group) hopped in the passenger seat.<br />
The clutch and the shift was a bit &#8220;squishy&#8221; (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that), but I got up to about 100 km/h before reaching the corner. It wasn&#8217;t easy to see (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that, either), and the car handled the braking and turning quite well &#8212; far better than I had expected.<br />
The return run was almost too much fun. Having (more or less) figured out the clutch&#8217;s sweet spot, I accelerated to over 120 km/h before I got to the stop. I popped the gear to neutral, and tried to put the brake through the floorboard. Nary a squeal from the tires, and the car came to a very quick halt.<br />
I would do the run again in an E500, but only as a passenger. It was a noticeable difference, mostly in that the E500 doesn&#8217;t handle as well. It is a bigger engine, but it&#8217;s also a bigger car.<br />
The smell of burning rubber was everywhere. If it wasn&#8217;t us smoking the tires on the slalom course (we regularly did &#8230; though I don&#8217;t believe *I* did), it was us squealing on the braking and handling course. Naturally, the C55 did have a bit of residual afterburn from the hard driving.<br />
We even managed to set off the brake overheat alarm on the E500.<br />
I have to say, I was duly impressed by the Mercedes-Benz lineup that we got to try. I somehow doubt that I&#8217;ll ever own one, mostly because I simply don&#8217;t get paid enough for one. (Besides, I do like my Mini.) What did I get out of all this today, then? A better appreciation for them, which is something you simply can&#8217;t get looking at pictures.<br />
Afterwards, we all headed over to one of the local pubs (Duck and Firkin, Fox and Gherkin, Bob and Merklin &#8230; something like that) for a few rounds. It gave us all a chance to recount our specific tales of automotive achievement, and ridicule each other about the dumb things we did.<br />
&#8216;Cuz hey, if you can&#8217;t mock your co-workers, what other reason do you have for working?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A busy weekend this most certainly was. But it was a fun, productive one.<br />
The first major thing was on Saturday. Mom&#8217;s in town to help out with Nana&#8217;s recovery from surgery (she had her knee replaced at the beginning of the month), so it was only fitting that Mom and Alex finally meet. Unlike my introduction to Alex&#8217;s dad and stepmom (see [[Troubles trying to get home]]), Alex knew about this long in advance, and I prepared her for it. Not that there&#8217;s much to prepare for &#8230; Mom isn&#8217;t an intimidating person.<br />
Cathy and Craig, on the other hand, that&#8217;s going to be an interesting introduction.<br />
The meeting was over lunch, at the Cactus Club Cafe up on Barlow Trail. I hadn&#8217;t been to a Cactus Club since I lived in Vancouver &#8212; so at least four and a half years ago, bordering probably on five. It seems that they&#8217;ve gone a little more upscale than I remembered, coming somewhere in between an upscale casual restaurant and a low-key nightclub. At lunch, it wasn&#8217;t loud or obnoxious, so it was at least pleasant. The decor was pretty chic, too.<br />
Mom had actually dressed for the part, as did Alex. I wore just whatever I felt like &#8212; woefully underdressed again. Mom and I spent most of our time catching up on things. I found out that Cathy and Craig have mostly finished their kitchen, and completed the new bathroom. (Cathy &#8212; care to update me every now and then?) A couple of deaths and a few new shake-ups. Overall, the usual.<br />
Alex and Mom didn&#8217;t talk too much. This was not even remotely surprising. Mom&#8217;s not the in-your-face inquisitive type (that&#8217;s Cathy), and Alex is a little shy. Fortunately, Mom knows a bit about Alex through me; Alex knows a bit of Mom through me. One day, I won&#8217;t have to be the middle man.<br />
Following lunch, I got down to a bit of work, most of which was getting my journals posted from my vacation in BC with Alex. I&#8217;ve got some actual work to do, which I hope to get off my chest before I go to bed tonight. (Alex went to lie down, victim of a nasty headache.)<br />
Tamara&#8217;s birthday is today (happy birthday, Tamara!), and last night was her birthday party, held at Booker&#8217;s Crab Shack. We&#8217;ve been there a couple of times, and it&#8217;s a great place for Louisiana-style food. Alex was to come, but her head just didn&#8217;t let her up. I stopped by briefly before joining Tamara, Dan, and Doug at Bookers. We were later joined by Todd, Andrea, and Cailey. Dinner was a nice fillet of tuna, for me, anyway.<br />
I returned to Alex&#8217;s after dinner, an Orange Crush Froster (Mac&#8217;s version of the Slurpee) in hand. I thought the coolness might help her head a bit. As it stands, she was already feeling better when I arrived, so it became a bit of a bonus. We watched &#8220;True Lies&#8221; on Access before going to bed.<br />
We tried not to sleep in this morning, as the big event of the day was going out to Canmore. Today was the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s production of &#8220;Mozart on the Mountain&#8221;. It&#8217;s a show that features Mozart, held on one of the greens of the Stewart Creek golf course, in the shadow of the Three Sisters. In theory, outdoor concerts shouldn&#8217;t get any better.<br />
To be certain, I&#8217;d have my doubts that it could get worse.<br />
First off, I have to say this much: the concert was excellent. The music was wonderful, the soloists (Nikki Einfeld, soprano; and Paul Grindlay, bass) were excellent (although showtunes from plays and movies don&#8217;t sound as good when sung by opera-trained singers). The weather was even decent (although it did get cooler as the day wore on), despite the garbage we&#8217;ve been having all summer (if you can in fact call it &#8220;summer&#8221;). I was a bit surprised at the lack of Mozart (we had only selections from &#8220;The Magic Flute&#8221; and Symphony #41), though they renditions of &#8220;Colonel Bogey March&#8221; and &#8220;Blue Danube Waltz&#8221; made up for it, in my ears, anyway. The volunteers were also quite nice, those we dealt with anyway.<br />
Now, here&#8217;s where my bitching starts. Just getting tickets was an ordeal. Alex has a huge gripe with this, having wasted over an hour trying to purchase them, and then spending two hours trying to (unsucessfully) pick them up. She even wandered into the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s offices without a single person actually being there. What&#8217;s up with that?<br />
That&#8217;s annoying. What was really frustrating was the organization (or complete lack thereof) at the event site. We were not permitted to drive to the Stewart Creek Golf Course. Why not? Try finding parking for 7,500 patrons in the area. We ended up having to park in fields and empty lots around Canmore, and were bussed to the site. That, at least, was intelligent. The busses came onto the grounds, went into a bus loop (newly-constructed for the event, and didn&#8217;t look big enough), and empty people out to walk up to the green, a distance of about 400-500 metres.<br />
We had to walk through a tent that contained sponsors, vendors, food, and the CPO&#8217;s merchandise store. The ground was soggy from all the rain. We walked on bark mulch, which wasn&#8217;t much better. It took a while before we got to the asphalt trail used for the golf carts. It wasn&#8217;t a hard walk, but it was a slow one &#8212; the trails are narrow, and people weren&#8217;t walking fast.<br />
Finding a seat wasn&#8217;t too hard, but we were quite a ways back. (The concert didn&#8217;t start until 14:00. We arrived at about 12:45. People were apparently lined up for the busses at 8:00 that morning.) The tricky part was finding seating where we weren&#8217;t surrounded by chairs. This annoyed the both of us.<br />
According to the sheets we were given, the ONLY kind of seating that was supposed to be allowed were &#8220;festival chairs&#8221; &#8212; folding chairs with legs less than half the length. This is so people without chairs can still see over and around you. I can count on my fingers and toes the number of actual festival chairs I saw. The rest were the full-sized chairs. There was absolutely no control on them whatsoever.<br />
Just a thought to the event planning team at the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra: the next time you say &#8220;festival seating&#8221;, make sure you either enforce it, or don&#8217;t mention it at all. People will abuse it to no end, and all it does is create friction between patrons. Why? Because, simply put, people are jerks and look out only for themselves. They have no qualms about putting up chairs in front of people who came on blankets (which were allowed, and dare I say encouraged by your instructions). If you do allow full-sized seats, how about designating blanket and festival seating in front of the full chair seating, or put the full chairs off to the sides and allow blankets in the middle?<br />
Luckily, Alex and I managed to keep some space to ourselves.<br />
The concert ran long. Originally supposed to finish at 16:00, it didn&#8217;t end until 16:45, completing with an unscheduled rendition of the Can-Can. Many people kicked up their heels to that &#8212; those who hadn&#8217;t already tried to leave.<br />
This is where it got really ugly.<br />
You can&#8217;t send 7,500 people down the golf cart paths at once. It takes a bit of effort. So the line moved very slowly. Also, you can&#8217;t put 7,500 people onto busses the way the organizers had envisioned. Their idea? Load up 4-5 busses at a time on the bus loop, send them up the hill and off to the parking lots, and bring in 4-5 more busses to be filled. On paper, it seemed like a good idea. Here&#8217;s the problem: on paper, everyone behaves.<br />
Rule #1 in event planning: people will never behave on their own if you don&#8217;t try to control them.<br />
The line moved painfully slow around the vendor tent at the bus loop. When we finally reached the other side, we saw, quite literally, a sea of people. There were no lines, and since all the volunteers were watching the crowd go down up on the paths, there were hardly any down at the loop to control the crowds. So what happened was a mess: people standing where they wanted to, trying to force their way onto the busses as they came by, and getting on where they could. Busses were sometimes half-full (or worse, completely full) starting from the far side of the loop (these selfish folk walked around the crowd, circumventing the honour system completely), preventing people at the front of the line from being able to get on.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t until people started to vocally complain that something was done. By that point, however, control had completely laspsed, and the system was mere moments from breaking down. Busses couldn&#8217;t be filled fast enough, and many had become so impatient that they were virtually standing on the road, blocking the busses. It all came to a head when one of the busses got too close to the inside of the loop, and almost rolled over onto its side. (Luckily, it didn&#8217;t, and no-one was injured.)<br />
Almost immediately, people started walking up the hill in droves. Patience had totally worn out, and we were ready to walk back to the car rather than wait for the busses to finally get their acts sorted out. When Alex and I reached the top of the hill, we found dozens of busses waiting, as if we should have all just come up there in the first place.<br />
I was amazed, even dumbfounded at the sheer idiocy of how poorly this had been handled. Don&#8217;t think you can control 7,500 people trying to get onto busses? Of course you can, but you have to run it like Disneyworld: forcibly put people in lines, and let only so many people through at a time. Let everyone know, right to the back of the line, how long the line is, and how long you&#8217;ll have to wait to get out. When you fill the bus, make people go right to the back and fill to the front. When people sit down at the front, they block everyone&#8217;s ability to get in. Remove constrained loading/unloading areas (like the loop), and go to the road. Load 10 busses at a time, and count off EXACTLY the number of people per bus, so there&#8217;s no question of too many or two few.<br />
It was that level of totalitarianism that was missing.<br />
We didn&#8217;t get on a bus until after 18:15. We didn&#8217;t get back to the car until after 18:30. We didn&#8217;t get home until after 20:00. This from a concert that ended three hours earlier. It&#8217;s an hour drive to Canmore, if you take your time.<br />
A question to the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra: you want to know why you&#8217;re losing patronage? Take a wild guess. I&#8217;ll give you a hint: if you&#8217;re running your business the same way you run that festival, you&#8217;d better start shopping out your resumes.<br />
&#8216;Cuz I ain&#8217;t the only one who noticed the problems today.<br />

		<p>No rooster, just the sounds of patrons leaving their rooms. I think I prefered the rooster.<br />
The Chateau&#8217;s name is a little misleading. One is brought to think of the Canadian Pacific (now Fairmont) hotels, with the old world grandeur and luxury. Make no mistake, folks, this ain&#8217;t the Banff Springs. It&#8217;s a 1950&#8217;s motor lodge with a fancy roof. But it&#8217;s comfortable, and the grounds a nicely kitchy. Besides, it&#8217;s a family business, and run very well.<br />

		<p>We awoke about an hour earlier than we have in mornings past, but for no real reason. We didn&#8217;t even hear the rooster!<br />
The porridge was followed, almost as soon as we could get ready, by a cat hunt. Allen has plans for his farm, which includes a new barn (of some kind). The problem, of course, is that you can&#8217;t have a barn without having mice and rats &#8212; that&#8217;s just a side effect. They can be controlled, however, with cats.<br />

		<p>That stupid rooster woke us up again. We&#8217;ve taken to mocking it. If it crowed normally, we probably wouldn&#8217;t mind so much. I fell back asleep, though, and Alex went into the house. She came back to wake me up for breakfast.<br />
Fog was hugging the ground all down the river valley. (Not exactly unheard of in the Lower Mainland.) Naturally, this set me off on a photography expedition. You have to move quickly with fog &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t last long once the sun starts coming up. I got some wonderful pictures, especially of a space amongst the trees near the tent.<br />

		<p>There&#8217;s a rooster not far from Allen&#8217;s farm. (Well, &#8220;farm&#8221; is using the term a bit loosely. It was a farm before he bought it, and it will be one again. But it&#8217;s going to take a bit of work.) This rooster isn&#8217;t particularly normal. We&#8217;ve been speculating why it doesn&#8217;t sound normal. Most roosters gain their sound by listening and mimicing the sound of other roosters. This rooster doesn&#8217;t seem to have rooster peers, so it lacks the stereotypical cockle-doodle-doo one would expect at 5:30 in the morning.<br />
This one sounds like a cross between a coyote and a freight locomotive horn.<br />

		<p>Cory had called me yesterday. I didn&#8217;t know until this morning because I hadn&#8217;t checked my cell phone. I&#8217;d had a dream that things had gone horribly awry at the office, and for some reason, that had made me want to check my cell phone. Good or bad, something was up. Sure enough, our newest star hire had backed out &#8212; an extremely disappointing turn of events. I wouldn&#8217;t talk to Cory about it until late in the afternoon.<br />
We were gone before 8:00. (We were to have left at 6:00, then 7:00, but last night&#8217;s arrival in Fairmont pushed us even later.) Allen was in Jean&#8217;s Honda Civic, Alex and I in Alex&#8217;s car. I drove while Alex read &#8220;Why I Hate Canadians&#8221;. Today&#8217;s lesson? Canada&#8217;s cast system, more formally known as how poorly we treat Indians. It&#8217;s a hard thing for a Canadian to admit that we don&#8217;t treat everyone fairly and equally. For a country known as being &#8220;nice&#8221;, we treat our aboriginal peoples very poorly. We&#8217;ve marginalized, forcibly contained, abducted and tried to convert them, even poisoned them with disease. And yet after 400 years, they&#8217;re still who they are.<br />

		<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like waking up to the sound of lawnmowers. Rousing, yet entirely annoying.<br />
We started the day off with a mom saver. This is generally a breakfast meal, though I suppose you could just as easily use a version of one for any meal of the day. The breakfast one we had consists of eggs, cubed bread, cream cheese (cubed, or something similar), some spices, and thrown in the oven to cook for 45 minutes. Throw on some maple syrup on top, and it&#8217;s pretty tasty. There&#8217;s also a ham and cheese version that I&#8217;m dying to try some time.<br />

		<p>I so wanted to get my butt out of the office, almost from the moment that I was alerted to the problem on MBUSA.com&#8217;s live server. There&#8217;s nothing like trying to diagnose the cause of a homepage failure when you&#8217;re not really sure what happened.<br />
Most of my day was like this. Going from one hot spot to another, barely getting enough time to wolf down some lunch. By the end of the day, I had to make sure that I wrapped up dialogue on three separate projects, ensure that the process was moving on two more, finish a proposal to Danny Sullivan for presentation topics for the next Search Engine Strategies conference, and write a rather lengthy email to about a dozen people to make sure they have some inkling about what the heck I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of weeks.<br />
Care to take bets that things will still go to hell in a handbasket tomorrow?<br />
