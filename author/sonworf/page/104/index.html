	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in your life when things start getting a lot more adult than you&#8217;re normally used to. For me, it was when my friends started getting married. But I didn&#8217;t really start getting self-conscious about it until this past weekend.<br />
On 30 June 2002, I had the honour of attending the wedding of two of my closest and dearest friends, Stuart and Therese. (They were marrying each other. Added bonus: I only had to buy one gift.)<br />
Although Therese and Stuart currently live in Calgary, the majority of their family lives in Ontario. The entire affair was held at Therese&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house in Carp, about a 25 km drive from downtown Ottawa. It would mean, for me, a trip back east, back to Ottawa for (another) summer wedding, and a chance to meet with old friends.<br />
I flew out on the 28th, flying to Hamilton via WestJet. (I&#8217;ve formally sworn off Tango &#8212; they might have cheaper fares than WestJet, but their total lack of service is enough to keep me going to WestJet. And I ain&#8217;t the only one.) Arriving late, I had to catch a cab to my mom&#8217;s house in Oakville. It&#8217;s not exactly a cheap cab ride.<br />
But stay in Oakville I didn&#8217;t &#8212; the next morning, after rising, showering, and running a couple of errands, I headed out to Ottawa. It had been five and a half years since I drove to Ottawa, and I was actually looking forward to the trip. (Or I would have, if the stupid tape deck in the car had accepted the cassette adapter so I could play my MiniDisc through the radio.) But all in all, it could have been worse &#8230; the radio could have been broken.<br />
I left Oakville almost an hour and a half late. And I paid for that delay, too. Although I shot down the QEW, the Gardner Expressway, and up the DVP without trouble, I had forgotten the cardinal rule of long weekends in Southern Ontario:<br />
Leave early, or sit in traffic.<br />
I got partway into Scarborough when my blunder came to fruition. Hard traffic. Really hard. And it lasted all the way out to Whitby. A drive that would normally take about 30 minutes took well over two hours.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take much to remind me of the reasons I no longer like Southern Ontario, especially in the summer. Topmost on my list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Traffic (especially rush hour or long weekend)</li>
<li>Heat (especially when combined with humidity)</li>
<li>Smell (especially when stuck in traffic when it&#8217;s really hot)</li>
</ol>
<p>Traffic didn&#8217;t really clear up until almost Kingston. Needless to say, I found out that Dad&#8217;s Chevy Cavalier can do 130 km/h without difficulty at all.<br />
Not having driven in Ottawa since about 1996, I had never taken the 416 before. This was a vast improvement on the old Highway 16, which was a deathtrap in winter, and just took too long the rest of the time. My speed barely slowing, I found myself in Ottawa in about the same amount of time it would have taken me on Highway 7, and without hitting traffic.<br />
Unlike the majority of others, I would not check into a hotel during my stay. Instead, I was invited to stay with my friends Stefan and Rebecca. As I would not be hanging out with Stuart and Therese the entire time, this was a chance for me to catch up with them, and hopefully have some fun.<br />
I soon found that my memory of their house&#8217;s location was a little off, and I ended up having to call for directions. Fortunately, I wasn&#8217;t too far off, so it only took a couple of minutes to show up. (Now I know exactly where the house is.)<br />
Rebecca was there (Stefan was off getting supplies to begin home renovations), so we chatted a while before everyone else came home. Deciding that the sticky heat of an early Ottawa summer was not exactly comfortable, we decided that maybe air-conditioned entertainment was more appropriate. It was movie time&#8230;<br />
Ottawa, like many other cities in Canada, is suffering from movie theatre overload. Theatres that were considered luxurious only a few years ago are now waning, becoming second-run &#8220;cheapie&#8221; theatres. (Oakville doesn&#8217;t even have a Famous Players or Cineplex anymore &#8212; only AMC exists in town, and only on the very east end.) The theatre we were in will be a cheapie in the next six months, we guessed.<br />
Although Minority Report is an excellent film, the lack of air conditioning in the theatre didn&#8217;t make the movie any better. In fact, we couldn&#8217;t wait to get out of the movie so we could cool down after a while. I just made a point of not moving during the 2.5+ hour show.<br />
The movie over, Rebecca, Stefan, and I opted to retreat to the relative wildness of the Bytown Market, the favoured hangout of the young and reckless. During the school year, this is where you can find the majority of post-secondary students in the National Capital Region. During the summer &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t really know where they all come from, but there&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em.<br />
We wandered around, trying to find a place that had nice margaritas and not too long a lineup. It took us a while, but eventually we found the right place. But by then, it was nearly closing time. So we downed what we had, and made way for home.<br />
The next day was the Big Day. But it wouldn&#8217;t start for me until 3:30 that afternoon. We started the morning with breakfast at a nearby restaurant. Then it was a leisurely return home, a long shower, and a very careful dressing. (Although I had to borrow one of Stefan&#8217;s undershirts to prevent nasty perspiration stains from finding their way to my shirt.)<br />
Did I mention that it was borderline insanely hot?<br />
Ottawa, like Southern Ontario, gets very warm in the summer. The temperature was in the low 30s, which in itself is quite warm. However, on top of that is the humidity, which cranks the perceived temperature to something like 45. (This is all Celsius, by the way.)<br />
The trip out to Carp was a relatively easy one, even though I hadn&#8217;t been there for at least six years &#8212; probably longer. Luckily, I remembered something about the Crazy Horse Saloon, which marked where I had to turn. After that, it was just a matter of finding the right house. It wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; there was only one wedding on the street that day.<br />
The Holton household was a flurry of activity, and I was one of the first to show. (Actually, I was asked by Therese and Stuart to arrive a little early. I had certain duties they wanted me to fulfill.) Therese was not quite at the panic stage yet, and seemed to be handling everything very well. Mrs. Holton seemed quite well off, as did Mr. Holton. Danica (Therese&#8217;s sister) was completely at ease. Stuart, who was roaming about, seemed a little nervous, but had planned everything out so well that he seemed barely fazed by the whole event to come.<br />
Before long, the guests started appearing in droves. Some people, such as Stuart&#8217;s parents, I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. Others, such as Jay, Matt, and Nabil, I had seen more recently, coincidentally at another wedding (Jay&#8217;s, to be specific). Then there were people from Guelph (where Therese when to university) that I hadn&#8217;t seen in almost six years. And then&#8230; well, the list is fairly lengthy. Suffice to say, it was good to see all.<br />
I took my place in the front row of the guest seats, where I could get a good view of the ceremony. Stuart and Therese trusted me to take some of the key photos (I really hope they turn out), so I had to be in a place where I could see them. I also had to cue the music at the right times, and still try to look like I was just a guest. Juggling two cameras ain&#8217;t easy, especially when you don&#8217;t have the luxury of telling people not to move.<br />
The sound of bagpipes soon wafted through the trees and under the tents &#8212; Stuart walked through the garden path, up the aisle, and to his place on the deck. After a few moments, the tune changed (and no, not to &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; &#8212; although that would have been rather interesting on the bagpipes), and Therese walked her way up to take her place next to Stuart.<br />
Then came the moment that 10 years ago I dreaded, that for the last four years have been expecting, and for the last six months, had truly hoped would be their happiest day. The ceremony began.<br />
Stuart was dressed in his fine kilt (his family is Scottish), but donned a lavender-blue button-down shirt with a matching silk tie. Therese&#8217;s dress was a matte silver silk with spaghetti string straps. Her hair was up (a rarity for her), with a small tiara to tie it all together. Although the tiara had been a bit of a joke when she first acquired it, when Therese walked up onto the deck, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of Audrey Hepburn in &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8221;. It had been a very long time since the last time, but I was envious of Stuart.<br />
The feeling passed quickly, though, and I was swept into the affair. It was simple, quiet, and exactly what I&#8217;d expect from Therese and Stuart &#8212; complete with a bit of humour when Therese stumbled across one of her lines, and teary when Therese had trouble getting another out through her half-sobs of joy. This was truly a happy day.<br />
The ceremony was short, but sweeter than the most luxurious sugar. Okay, yeah, that sounds cheesy, but you gotta understand &#8212; this is the first wedding I actually cried at. Until then, I didn&#8217;t really get the joke: &#8220;I always cry at weddings.&#8221;<br />
The vows were exchanged, as were rings, and before we knew it, came the kiss. I was so overwhelmed with everything that I almost forgot the music cue.<br />
Therese and Stuart adjourned to a small table to sign away their lives, so to speak. Pictures were taken in spades. The Music Gods smiled on Stuart and Therese that day &#8212; the first song in the queue (Tom Petty&#8217;s &#8220;Wildflowers&#8221; finished just as they returned to centre stage, to be pronounced (offically) husband and wife. As they left, I skipped to the fifth song, the one they wanted to play as they finished and left the stage, The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;All You Need Is Love&#8221;.<br />
The crowd moved to the front yard, where the majority of the &#8220;formal&#8221; photographs were taken. There was no professional photographer, Therese and Stuart were relying on the rest of us shutterbugs to get the photographs. I was entrusted a little further with Stuart&#8217;s manual camera (which, thankfully, he&#8217;d already preset for use) &#8212; I only pray that the pictures I took meet with his approval.<br />
Pictures wrapped up, the party slowly began as people started to filter over to the tent again (a group of us had moved the chairs around and put up tables during the picture session &#8212; I was supposed to coordinate it, but I got caught up in the photos). Drinks came out (well, they&#8217;d been out for a while, but they came out a bit faster now), and people started mingling.<br />
While people mingled, we had one problem to solve. In all our haste, we had forgotten the head table. There wasn&#8217;t one. But luckily, there were enough people to solve the problem &#8212; two small tables could seat eight, and suddenly everyone was happy again.<br />
By the time table started in to get their meals, we had to start lighting the citronella lamps to try and cut down on the armada of mosquitos that were started to thin out the available blood supply.<br />
Dinner was wonderfully simple: Salads, poached salmon, and a hot buffet that included roast beef. It successfully covered everyone&#8217;s tastes and desires &#8230; especially those of us who love a variety.<br />
Dinner completed, people began to mingle again. Slowly at first, some moving into the house to escape the invasion of airborne bloodsuckers, others taking their leave and heading home (or to their respective hotels). Dancing was informal, and not really long-lived. Although the constant movement kept the mosquitos at bay a little better, not everyone was completely comfortable in the unbearable heat. (Even afer the sun went down, it was still quite warm.)<br />
People began to dissipate like steam from a kettle over the next couple of hours. I was one of the last to leave. I returned to my car, and headed back towards Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s.<br />
As I drove in the cool(er) silence of the night, I thought about the day&#8217;s proceedings. Yes, things had changed. Stuart and Therese were no longer just friends, or partners, or significant others. They, like many of my friends, were now married. Life was again moving forward, in its inexorable march forward. And while I was so happy that their wedding had been a joyous one, there was that slightly ominous undertone of the finality of life, that this is an event that I will witness but once.<br />
But that&#8217;s why I take pictures, so I can relive the moment any time I want. And it&#8217;s why I write these journals, so I can also remember my thoughts and feelings.<br />
Congratulations, my dear friends. May your marriage bring you joy, prosperity, and the sound of little feet.<br />
And I ain&#8217;t referring to your cats.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember when I used to have time to kick back, relax, and spend an afternoon watching TV.<br />
I think I was five.<br />
This weekend past was yet another in a string of busy, hectic times. As June rolls towards a close, many things are coming up that need to be tackled. Two things of particular importance: Turning my apartment back over to the building, and getting ready for Therese and Stuart&#8217;s wedding.<br />
The former meant I had to spend a large portion of Saturday in my apartment trying to clean the last of it up. Now, if I was smart, I would have started out first thing in the morning. However, me being the idiot I am, decided that I also needed to make a run to the local Humungous Hardware Store to find something things I needed around the house (pliers, a Dremel, garden hose and nozzle, propane tank, branch cutters (I have some very overgrown bushes), and so on and so forth).<br />
Having wasted a couple of hours doing that, I quickly stopped off at home before heading over to the apartment to clean. First was a run through the bathroom, trying to get a weird stain out of the bathtub (now mostly gone, thanks to CLR) and make everything sparkle. Then it was off to the kitchen to mop floors, etc. so I could move the last of the boxes off the carpets. It was time for the Rug Doctor.<br />
Now, the apartment management doesn&#8217;t seem to like Rug Doctors. I have no idea why. But frankly, I don&#8217;t give a damn what they think &#8212; I needed one for the house anyway, and figured taking a couple of hours to run it through the apartment first couldn&#8217;t hurt.<br />
Chris, you&#8217;ll be glad to know all those stains we accumulated (thanks to a certain cat) are now gone.<br />
The carpets are now cleaner than when I first moved in. But the managers will probably still complain that I didn&#8217;t get a professional in there and demand that I do. I swear, some people are just plain silly with requirements sometimes.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t money wasted &#8212; I wanted a Rug Doctor for the house, too. I never got a chance to clean the carpets before moving in, and I knew full well that the previous owner didn&#8217;t clean &#8217;em on her way out. Upon arrival at the house, I quickly realized that the stairs would be nigh on impossible for me to clean with just the machine &#8212; it was too big for the small spaces. I needed an attachment.<br />
Calgary has a lot of Safeways. I&#8217;m not sure why, but there are times when that comes in really handy. For example, I rented the actual Rug Doctor from the Safeway that was nearest to my apartment. My house, however, is only two and a half blocks from a different Safeway. So, wandering over to my &#8220;new&#8221; grocery store, I negotiated a rental for the upholstery attachment. The clerks were a little confused at first when I told them what I did, but the senior clerk on staff promptly smiled, handed me the bag of hose and cleaning nozzle, and asked that I merely return it before the store closed. No charge.<br />
I love this city.<br />
I swear that the previous owner never cleaned anything. She might as well have been a renter for all she did. The yard&#8217;s a mess, the kitchen&#8217;s not in the best of shape, the dishwasher is probably beyond repair now, the washer/dryer is so poorly installed that it goes off-balance constantly, the house needs repainting, every bush and tree is overgrown, the garage is literally falling apart, the shingles need replacing, and the carpets were completely, utterly, and totally filthy.<br />
They didn&#8217;t look filthy, at first glance, but after running the Doctor over them, I felt a little ill.<br />
Chris and I vaccummed fairly regularly in our apartment (okay, sometimes not, but we tried to be regular). But we had friends over all the time, tracking in dirt (particularly in the winter) from everywhere (we did the same, of course). You&#8217;d think with such high traffic, that our carpets would be dirty. They were. But the water I emptied in the apartment didn&#8217;t even come close to the sheer sludge I was emptying from the carpets in the house.<br />
Ew.<br />
I finished the day off with a steak dinner (my reward for being utterly exhausted) &#8230; the first made in my new barbecue, a housewarming present I got from my realtor. (Did I mention that she is absolutely awesome?) Although I did have to figure out why it wasn&#8217;t working properly, so my dinner was delayed until almost 23:30.<br />
The next day, I tried to start off early, so I could get those rogue boxes out of my apartment and over to the house. So much for plans.<br />
I arrived at Stuart and Therese&#8217;s house a little later than planned, but not terribly late. Sunday was not only Father&#8217;s Day but also their wedding shower. A bittersweet day for me, if there ever was one. Although, I do have to say that some of Dad&#8217;s humour managed to find me. When asked by someone who doesn&#8217;t really know me: &#8220;Have you called your father today?&#8221;, I replied (with a big, dopey grin): &#8220;Can&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;d need to do a seance.&#8221; Next year, though, I&#8217;ll use someone else&#8217;s idea: &#8220;Not yet &#8212; can you gimme a hand with this ouija board?&#8221;<br />
We drove down to Lakeview Golf Course (a city course) to participate in Stuart&#8217;s end of the shower. (Therese was holding a pottery session. The problem for me was that I was torn between them both. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to choose &#8212; I was assigned Stuart by someone else.) Right by the biggest water trap in the city (the Glenmore Reservoir), it was a little out of the way (Stuart and I had some trouble initially finding the place), but an otherwise great place to be.<br />
We broke into one group of four, and two groups of three. (The groups of three had extra people thrown in to round out the foursome.) I played in the last group with Stuart and Heather, the roommate of (a different) Geoff, one of Therese&#8217;s friends from her psychology classes. (Geoff and Stuart are good friends, too, of course.) Most of the others in the crowd were former (or current) friends from Stuart&#8217;s office(s).<br />
I vaguely remembered my last outing in golf, on the Canadian Forces Base Comox golf course when Gerry and I were visiting his uncle in September 1997. I remembered how badly I sucked. I definitely haven&#8217;t improved since then.<br />
Although I had a few good hits, they rarely went in the direction I wanted them to. And I was definitely not good on the greens. I&#8217;m used to BC greens, which are wet and really slow. Calgary greens are faster than a chuckwagon race. It took me nine holes just to get the hang of &#8217;em.<br />
But I shot a 61 overall, nonetheless. Before you get too impressed with the score, though, please understand that it was only a nine-hole course.<br />
I shot 27 on the first three holes alone.<br />
The tournament over (myself winning with the largest score, though the other Geoff wasn&#8217;t far behind), we adjourned to Jack Astor&#8217;s out in Westhills for the 19th hole.<br />
We broke up a little before 16:00, Stuart and I having to make a run to Mission to pick up Leah (one of Therese&#8217;s classmates), run by Therese and Stuart&#8217;s house (to get a video camera and so Stuart could change), and then way up into Tuscany (in the distant northwest corner of Calgary) for the shower.<br />
By now, I know most of people who were there (I&#8217;ve been invited to enough soirees that include Therese&#8217;s classmates that I&#8217;m reasonably familiar to them), so I didn&#8217;t feel too out of place. Besides, they&#8217;re all really nice people, so it doesn&#8217;t take much to get to know them.<br />
After a quick meal, we sat down to watch the present opening. I sat on the stairs and took pictures (which wasn&#8217;t easy, with the lighting and angles I had to work with). As I sat there, I had glimpses of the past, going back to high school and early university, when Therese and Stuart were dating. I felt vaguely uncomfortable again, like I was an unwanted outsider.<br />
I have no idea what brought that on. Stuart and Therese are two of my closest, most trusted friends. They&#8217;re the sort of people I have no reservations about helping, or asking for help. Sometimes, I swear the human mind is a scary, unforgiving place.<br />
Or it could just be me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The last thing I really needed was a cat underfoot as people were rapidly moving things out of the apartment. It wouldn&#8217;t be good for them, and it really wouldn&#8217;t be good for Miao-Yin. This, in my opinion, was the worst part of the entire moving process.<br />
On Saturday afternoon (1 June 2002), I returned to the apartment to gather the cat&#8217;s things, and then gather the cat. Gathering her items was easy &#8212; a shopping bag, her food dishes, food, combs, brushes, and so forth. Then came the fun part: Getting Miao-Yin in the kitty carrier.<br />
It seems that most cats actually like kitty carriers &#8230; at least until they&#8217;re locked inside them. Miao-Yin doesn&#8217;t even like going inside hers. When Chris first brought her home from the Humane Society, he told me of how much she yowled the whole way &#8212; the cardboard box hadn&#8217;t really been her thing. After a while, Chris had the joy of taking Miao-Yin to the vet (for checkups, etc.), and had to use the box. Somehow, he managed to get her in.<br />
Eventually, Chris bought a proper kitty carrier. Miao-Yin wouldn&#8217;t even go near it at first. Chris hit upon the idea of putting her food dish inside it so she&#8217;d have to go in. Brilliant move &#8212; and it worked very well. It wasn&#8217;t to hard locking her inside, even though she&#8217;d always keep her hind feet outside the cage so she could back up if someone tried to close the door (never worked, she&#8217;d always end up inside).<br />
With all this training in mind, moving Miao-Yin should have been easy, right?<br />
Rule #1: Cats always know what you&#8217;re going to do before you do it.<br />
What should have been a 10 second job turned into a 20 minute epic ordeal. A battle between man and beast for dominance. A realization that trying to put a cat into a carrier is like forcing a water balloon into a Coke bottle.<br />
But I eventually won, but not before one of Miao-Yin&#8217;s rear claws slashed the very heel of my left hand. Luckily, it was at an angle, else I might have needed stitches. She yowled the whole way, sounding as miserable as possible. She wanted it abundantly clear that she did not want to be in that carrier.<br />
When I finally released her in the house, it felt like returning a rehabilitated animal to its natural habitat. She slowly put her head out, looked, sniffed, and then bolted downstairs and disappeared. She was still exploring the basement when I brought down the litter box. The first thing she did when she saw it was use it. I&#8217;ll assume that&#8217;s a good thing. (At least, I haven&#8217;t been finding little presents all over the place.)<br />
With Miao-Yin squared away, I finished assembling the barbecue (see [[Annual General Meeting, Taking Possession of my House]]) and put it off to one side. I figured we&#8217;d need the kitchen space. I then left Miao-Yin to investigate the house on her own, and returned to finish packing.<br />
I had been packing all week, when I got home from work. It looked pretty straight-forward, and there was nothing that set off alarm bells for me. It was now only just over a day before things started heading out the door. I didn&#8217;t have that much left. I didn&#8217;t see a problem.<br />
Which is probably why I didn&#8217;t think much of it when Stuart and I went out for dinner and to see a movie. (As an side note, the Jack Astor&#8217;s restaurant chain has basically hit rock-bottom. From previously having the best staff in the biz, they&#8217;ve all become inattentive, distant, and boring. As much as I hate to say it, I won&#8217;t likely go back. As it stands Stuart and I didn&#8217;t even eat there &#8212; we left after they left us waiting in the booth for 20 minutes.)<br />
When I got back, I had to finish packing. And I did. Around 7:00am. (Chris, for the record, we have way more stuff than we thought we did.)<br />
That allowed me some precious sleep time. Not that I got a lot &#8212; I was completely wired on Coke and adrenaline, so what sleep I did get was quite fitful. At 8:30, I pulled myself up off the couch (the last time I&#8217;ll ever sleep on them, I&#8217;m happy to say) and looked outside. The previous day&#8217;s forecast had been partly cloudy, with a 40% chance of rain.<br />
The 40% lasted all day. (I felt like I was living in Vancouver again.) At least it didn&#8217;t snow&#8230;<br />
At 8:50, I went over to feed Miao-Yin, and then up the Northeast to get the moving truck. (One of the last ones in the city on what seems to be the busiest moving days of the year.)<br />
At 10:05am, I arrived at my apartment, having picked up Tamara from her apartment, and met up with both Fritz and Doug, arriving with their McDonald&#8217;s breakfast in hand. Tamara promptly bolted off for breakfast, while I started to try and organize. Over the course of the next hour, Teak, Rose, my cousin Darren, Stuart, Darren&#8217;s and my Uncle Mike, and Kaz showed up to assist (though Teak had to run off and pick up Kaz).<br />
At first, the move was slow. Because I couldn&#8217;t book an elevator for 10am on a Sunday, we had to grab whatever elevator came down. Figuring this was not going to be an easy move without a dedicated elevator, we packed what we could and kept going. Luckily, as I was emptying out the second load into the lobby, I spotted one of the maintenance workers in the building, and begged to lock off #3 elevator so we could move. He was more than helpful, and that got us moving into high gear.<br />
Fritz, Doug, and Tamara moved items from the apartment to the elevator. Darren ran the elevator, and helped unload at the bottom. The rest of us moved items from the lobby to the truck, and reorganized everything inside. The process was far easier than I ever could have imagined. (And a lot easier than moving a certain cat, let me tell you.)<br />
By about 11:20, we&#8217;d worked our way down to the really large and bulky stuff: the beds, the TV, and the couches. That&#8217;s about when things started going awry&#8230;<br />
I had called on Friday to see what bookings I could get for Sunday morning. The person I had talked to said that no bookings were available until 3pm (which was far too late for my liking). I asked if all the morning slots were taken &#8212; I was told that you couldn&#8217;t book before noon, and had to wing it if you wanted. I said I would, and was told if I found a maintenance worker, I could lock of #3 (and so I dispel the belief that I&#8217;m really intelligent when I asked the maintenance worker to lock off #3).<br />
But&#8230;<br />
Someone forgot to tell the weekend manager, who promptly freaked all over Fritz, Doug, and Darren (Tamara and her mother were organizing Tamara&#8217;s things at her apartment). Threats of taping the door, calling the cops, and going to court started circulating. (Needless to say, I&#8217;ve never really been a huge fan of this particular manager.)<br />
When the manager arrived at the lobby, I did a hasty explanation of what happened, and that I&#8217;d forgotten to pay my June rent (which was true &#8212; I had). She simply told me to go to the office when I was done. For a moment, I felt like I was in grade school again&#8230;<br />
The move complete (five minutes ahead of schedule), I explained in detail the manager what had happened. It seemed that she understood, and was more than happy to take my money for June. But the grief was finally over and done with &#8212; the apartment mostly emptied, and the two worst couches that I&#8217;ve ever had were disposed of.<br />
Then we were off to Tamara&#8217;s, where we acquired a mini-freezer, a small couch, bed (mattress, box spring, and frame), dresser, several boxes of dry foodstuffs, more CDs (as if I didn&#8217;t have enough for four or five people), and various other things. The truck (a large cube van) was full. We had to resort to putting the couch and my bike into Uncle Mike&#8217;s pickup truck (which, thankfully, had a cab over the bed).<br />
Then it was over to the house. Luckily, either the rain, the Sunday, or some fluke of nature freed up parking spots in front of the house. It was a minor thing to park the truck and start unloading. Of course, that&#8217;s also when it started to rain harder.<br />
Figures.<br />
But in about 30 minutes, we emptied both trucks, and filled the living room, dining room, and kitchen with a lot of unrecognizable stuff. It&#8217;ll probably take Tamara and I about a week or two to sort all that out. A lot of it are Chris&#8217; things that I offered to store while he lives the high life in Japan. The fun part will be figuring out which is his.<br />
The actual move finally over, we celebrated with the most traditional of most post-moving repasts: Beer and pizza.<br />
Surprisingly enough, Miao-Yin weathered the move-in a lot better than I thought she would &#8212; I fully expected a lot of cowering in the basement from all the activity. But it didn&#8217;t seem to bother her too much. She spent most of her time at the downstairs stairwell, but regularly poked her head out to see what was going on. I already believe the move will be good for her.<br />
There are a couple of side-effects. First, I&#8217;m dead tired. (The not sleeping thing on Saturday probably didn&#8217;t help.) And my legs are about ready to declare themselves distinct societies and separate from my body. (In shorter terms, they hurt. A lot.)<br />
But I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m in the house. A little tidying, a little cleaning, and it&#8217;ll be a completely comfortable, liveable space. And that&#8217;s all I really wanted right from the beginning. The road might be long, windy, littered with potholes, but ultimately it goes somewhere. But admittedly, this is one time where the destination is more appreciated than the journey.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This was, to say the least, one of the busier weekends I&#8217;ve had in a long time. It was a very good weekend in many respects, not the least of which was actually (finally) getting my house. But it all kinda started this way&#8230;<br />
Saturday morning, 9:30am. After staying up a little late to do more packing (with a lot left still to do), I arose a little tired, but excited to tackle the day. I had three basic things to do: Attend the Rocky Mountain Rail Society&#8217;s Annual General Meeting in the south end of Calgary, take possession of my house, and finish packing. Looks fairly simple, right?<br />
But simple can be deceiving&#8230;<br />
I arrived about two minutes before the AGM was to start. Not a huge deal &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the only straggler, and we didn&#8217;t actually get going until about 11:10am that morning anyway. That gave me time to set up the laptop with images of trains and steam locomotives that I&#8217;ve been taking for the last year. (I&#8217;ve got quite a few of them now.)<br />
I&#8217;ve never been to an annual meeting of any kind, and this was pretty much an eye-opener for me. Despite the fact that, amongst ourselves, the RMRS is pretty lax. We don&#8217;t have any hierarchy, we all joke/make fun of each other, bend rules to get things done, and avoid formality almost as if it were a disease. Until the AGM on Saturday morning, there was only one case I knew of where things were followed to the letter: Actually running 6060, at which point the half century of railroading rules and regulations take over, and are followed to the punctuation mark. The AGM was the second time.<br />
The first thing I noticed was that certain people (the Treasurer, the Membership Officer, the Secretary, and some of the Directors) wore name plates. The meeting was ordered, directed by the Chairman (who was elected at the end of the meeting to President, our last president having fulfilled his term and stepped down), recorded by the Secretary, and everyone coordinating it by referral of title (e.g. &#8220;Mr. Chairman&#8221;), even by the founders and most senior members.<br />
The meeting closed at 12:45pm, just in time for a catered lunch. This was great for me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t have a lot of food in the apartment, and I figured it would be a while before I&#8217;d be eating again (I had a lot of packing to do, and didn&#8217;t want to get too distracted).<br />
The meeting having more or less wrapped up by 2:00pm, I hopped in my car and drove out to Sunnyside to meet up with Robyn, my realtor. When I arrived at 2:30pm, she was already there. We took quick looks around the house, seeing what was in order, and what wasn&#8217;t.<br />
The main floor was in good condition. The floors were a little scratched (but to be expected with hardwood &#8230; I need to refinish them in a year or two anyway), and the walls had been repainted (or touched up) where items had removed from the walls. In the kitchen, there were three things slightly amiss.<br />
First, the hot water connection under the sink was still leaking (we identified this during the home inspection, and the previous owner was to have fixed it), there were still dishes in one of the cupboards (not sure if they&#8217;re forgotten or discarded), and there was a partially-assembled barbecue in the middle of the floor.<br />
Yes, a barbecue. Robyn had said from relatively early in our home purchasing relationship that she&#8217;d do this, because I&#8217;d directed a couple of people her way. I&#8217;d always kind of resisted this generosity, mostly because I didn&#8217;t think I deserved it. But there it was &#8230; in it&#8217;s partially-assembled glory (Robyn hadn&#8217;t finished putting it together yet).<br />
I said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again: I&#8217;ve got the best realtor in town.<br />
We quickly toured the basement. A couple of boxes, but otherwise empty and no different than the last time I&#8217;d seen it. Nearly whacked my head again on the air ducts. (If I&#8217;m in there long enough, one of the things I&#8217;m going to do is drop that floor a couple of feet. Darren nearly decapitated himself when taking things down there on Sunday.)<br />
The upstairs had a couple of problems. The first was a series of stains in the north bedroom which I couldn&#8217;t remember having seen before, nor did Robyn, and we know it wasn&#8217;t mentioned during the home inspection, so we wonder if the inspector saw them. (Mind you, the previous owner did have screens and furniture there, so it&#8217;s possible she hid them from sight.)<br />
But the stains weren&#8217;t the worst part. As I looked just past the stains to the wall, I noticed a rather odd thing that ran right around the base of the walls. The baseboards. Or more specifically, the lack thereof.<br />
The previous owner had taken them. To paraphrase Tom Arnold in &#8220;True Lies&#8221;, what kind of sick freak takes the baseboards?!<br />
That one had Robyn and I completely stumped. I had to laugh. I mean, they&#8217;re baseboards: Cheap strips of painted wood. I&#8217;m actually amazed she managed to get them off without damaging the walls. But now I have to replace them, and I don&#8217;t really have the equipment at the moment. And that&#8217;s in addition to all the other things I have to do around the house.<br />
We adjourned outside to quickly inspect the exterior. I might need to paint this year, too. I&#8217;ll need to double check, but it should hopefully be not too bad. (Luckily, I don&#8217;t need to strip &#8212; all I need to do is paint over what&#8217;s already there.) The roof needs reshingling (but I knew that before) &#8212; if not this year, definitely next.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the garage. I have a funny feeling the last few tenants haven&#8217;t even bothered with going inside it. The door lock is broken, the walls are rotting, the roof sags and leaks, and the concrete pad is pretty much gone. But it&#8217;s a single car detached garage. A couple months with proper construction should replace it without too much difficulty. For now, I&#8217;ll just keep an eye on it. But sooner or later, I&#8217;ll need to do the actual work.<br />
Lastly, there&#8217;s the yard. The last owner was quite good at maintaining the interior of the house. The yard, however, was not her forte. Many parts are weeded over, saplings everywhere, and brown spots on some parts of the yard. It&#8217;s going to take a bit of work to clean all that up. I&#8217;ll leave the interior work until this winter, so I can clean that up now.<br />
But hey, I wanted a bit of a fixer-upper to begin with. So in retrospect, my initial desire still gets fulfilled &#8212; by the garage, if nothing else.<br />
A half hour after leaving, I was done. I had keys in hand, and was ready to return home and pack. The actual transfer of ownership, though, seemed lacking in something. Technically, all Robyn had to do was put keys in my hand. There was no fanfare, no celebration. Just &#8220;here&#8217;s your keys!&#8221;. Mind you, Robyn was pretty happy about it. But after five months of waiting, it was anti-climactic. It was almost, I shudder to say, empty.<br />
I returned to the apartment to resume packing and prepare for the move. But there was one thing I wanted to do first: Move Miao-Yin.</p>

		<p>Warm weather has come late to Calgary, but it is quite a relief that it finally has. Shorts, sandals, t-shirts, and (almost) no fear of waking up to a White Christmas every morning. I haven&#8217;t seen my breath in well over a week, and if the forecasts are (reasonably) correct, I won&#8217;t see it again for a few months.<br />
Deciding that I needed to take a break or suffer the consequences, I make a mental note not to go into the office on the weekend past. Well, except for Saturday &#8212; but it wasn&#8217;t to do actual work. It was to finish construction on a site for the Toronto Railway Historical Committee (of which I&#8217;m on the Communications Committee) &#8212; www.trhc.ca. They&#8217;re (we&#8217;re) just getting off the ground, but the president has done much in a very short period of time.<br />
There&#8217;s a couple of weird bugs (only with Macs it seems), but for now it serves the purpose.<br />
After that, I adjourned home. To watch movies. Not having Chris around to talk with at home really brings me down sometimes.<br />
Sunday was significantly better, not only from an activity perspective, but also from a weather perspective. It was already well into the mid-teens when I left to wander around the Lilac Festival that was taking place on 4th Street, from 13th Ave. SW to Elbow Drive. Almost 15 blocks of street vendors, street performers, and about half of Calgary. Despite all the people, I found it almost impossible to walk up and down the street without a huge grin &#8212; outside, in the sun, and doing what could easily be construed as summer activities.<br />
My first stop along the way was at Sushi Kawa, at 4th St. and about 22nd Ave. Not only was I deeply in the throes of sushi withdrawal, it was a good chance to visit with Kaz, who works there.<br />
It was a bit of an odd experience going into a restaurant on my own. Sure, I&#8217;ve gone into fast food joints on my own before, but an actual restaurant &#8212; that&#8217;s a new one for me. But there are advantages in Japanese restaurants: Stools at the sushi counter.<br />
The road was beyond packed by the time I got back outside. But I pressed on, walking the length of the street to see anything of interest. Aside from a steel drum band (that actually made Enrique Iglesias sound good), a one man band that did a startling good rendition of Kurt Cobain, a belly dancer, and the living statues &#8230; it wasn&#8217;t all that thrilling. I kind of missed the Buskerfest in Ottawa during the summers. Far more entertaining.<br />
Reaching the other end of the road, I returned to the apartment to rest a while before heading over to Millennium Park for a free concert by the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra. The CPO, like many orchestras, is suffering from lack of interest. This was their attempt to make themselves better known, and hope that it will generate a little more revenue for them in the long run.<br />
It was really nice to sit on the grass (but watching for all the goose droppings) and listen to a good orchestra play live music. It was really good to really see the stereotypical view of Calgary being shed away as they played traditional English folk tunes, music from Les Mis, even a piece composed by the resident composer (which sounded not unlike a Stravinsky-influenced John Williams).<br />
Until they started playing fiddle music. So much for smashing stereotypes.<br />
They finished off with the theme from Star Wars. They did a pretty decent job of it, although I personally think the tempo was too fast.<br />
Concert over, I proceeded to wander around the river and see what there was to see. People were out skating, biking, jogging, walking, but most of all, enjoying the warmth. It&#8217;s been a chilly start to the year, and I think we&#8217;ll all very happy to have it a little nicer around here.<br />
And now that I&#8217;ve said that, we&#8217;re probably gonna have a blizzard on Sunday&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Long weekends are rarely long enough. I&#8217;d like one to last about a year, personally, but without all the seasonal changes. But I suppose that&#8217;s what Hawaii is for&#8230;<br />
My weekend (sort of) started on Thursday night, with the premiere of &#8220;Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones&#8221;. Although I&#8217;m still not sold on the title, I think the movie is a vast improvement over Episode One. And it&#8217;s gonna be a heck of a lead-in for Episode Three.<br />
One thing that was definitely missing this time was hype. True, hype can severely detriment a film. It can drag it down by setting expectations far too high. But at the same time, there&#8217;s such a powerful excitement that you really don&#8217;t care if the movie sucks or not &#8212; you just want to be there. While I can&#8217;t speak for either Therese or Stuart, I was a little disenchanted this time. Even when the words: &#8220;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&#8230;&#8221; came up, and the audience went ballistic (I love opening night crowds), I didn&#8217;t feel that excited grin cross my face. It was almost as if I was just seeing another movie.<br />
Maybe I was, but wasn&#8217;t willing to accept it. Who knows &#8212; a few people have speculated that this hasn&#8217;t exactly been the best year for me: My father passing away, my workload and responsibility load increasing dramatically, and now Chris having left for Japan. (And we&#8217;re not even half-way through the year yet.) I suppose it&#8217;s entirely possible that the joy I should feel last left. Is it time for a change in lifestyle, perhaps? Well, I&#8217;ve got one coming soon&#8230;<br />
The date of closure of my house is coming soon. In less than two weeks, I&#8217;ll be in my &#8220;new&#8221; house. I had originally feared that the excitement I first felt upon buying the house would eventually dissipate, and I wouldn&#8217;t end up wanting to move. Thankfully, the last few days have shown me that I am not only ready to leave my apartment, but I can&#8217;t wait to move into the house. Right now, I need the patience of a Jedi just to keep from bursting my skin wanting to move in. I&#8217;ve started driving by the house, just to remind myself. At times, this still feels like a dream. Whether or not it turns out to be a nightmare remains to be seen&#8230;<br />
On Friday night, I was supposed to attend Star Wars with friends from the office. However, I had other plans &#8212; seeing friends I haven&#8217;t seen for a very long time: Ed and Jen. Ed is one of my friends from first year university, and was one of my roommates during my second year. Both years rank very highly in my best and most cherished memories. It had been over four years since I&#8217;d last seen Jen &#8212; about one and a half since I&#8217;d last seen Ed &#8212; and in both cases it had been far too long.<br />
They arrived on the 9:45pm flight from Toronto, and despite looking a little dazed (and being quite hungry), they looked almost exactly the way I&#8217;d last remembered them. It&#8217;s good to know some things don&#8217;t change too much. We picked up their luggage, arranged for their rental car, and headed to my apartment. (Although I had sent them instructions on how to get there, I figured it was just plain easier for me to pick them up. Long flights and detailed instructions rarely mix well.)<br />
After unceremoniously dumping their belongings at the apartment, we adjourned to Ceili&#8217;s for a late evening meal (of chicken wings and seasoned chicken bites) and beer. It was also a chance to retell old stories, catch up on new ones, and retie the old bonds that had kept us friends. If anything, it reinforced the need for me to visit with friends this year, especially those I haven&#8217;t seen for a long time.<br />
We were in bed relatively early (I was plenty tired, and they were jet lagged), and up by 8:30. Ed and Jen were parked out on the street, which expired by 9:00 &#8212; besides, they wanted to get a start on the day and get on their camping vacation. The first order of business however, was breakfast. I knew of two places not too far away that were supposedly quite good, but only one I knew of for certain &#8212; The Galaxie Diner.<br />
This is probably about as landmark as a Calgary restaurant gets. And it has, according to my breakfast cohorts, some of the best breakfasts available. You just need to get there fairly early. Something I definitely need to keep in mind for the next time people are out this way.<br />
Following breakfast was a series of trips to get provisions and supplies for Ed and Jen. Luckily, they had upgraded their car reservation the night before from a Ford Focus to Pontiac Intrigue. (Yeah, I know, &#8220;upgrade&#8221; is subjective. Simple fact: the Intrigue is bigger. Hence, more room to store all the stuff they had.) By 2:30, they had all the things they needed, had seen a bit of Calgary, and were ready to head into the mountains.<br />
I spent the rest of the day watching TV and movies. I felt a complete lack of desire to go outside.<br />
Sunday morning, met up with Kaz for dim sum. She had called me a couple days earlier interested in going for dim sum, if there was a party going. I had some difficulty raising anyone else (turned out to be a case of missing people), so it ended up just being Kaz and myself.<br />
A first note on dim sum for two: Can&#8217;t be done, especially if you know what you&#8217;re getting and have been with large groups. Both Kaz and I overate. But it was all good &#8212; I didn&#8217;t eat again until much later.<br />
Going to dim sum with Kaz was a little uncomfortable. It was just me, so I lacked the &#8220;safety in numbers&#8221;. I know this sounds strange, but look at it this way: I was out with my best friend&#8217;s fiancée, while my best friend is half-way around the world. It&#8217;s a little disconcerting, and only because I&#8217;m still getting to know her, and she&#8217;s getting to know me. But by the end, I was feeling much better &#8212; I think it&#8217;s just a case of finding ground on my own. (Previously, Chris had always been around.) One thing the dim sum did give us was a chance to talk. There were a few things Kaz needed to know, not only about Chris, but about the rest of us, too. Barring a change in plans, Kaz will become Chris&#8217; wife, and therefore someone who&#8217;ll need to know who we are.<br />
After dim sum, I wandered about downtown for a while, but ended up at home. Watching TV. And movies.<br />
Luckily, I was rescued by Stuart and Therese, who invited me over for the first barbecue of the season, and to watch the final episode of the X-Files. The three of us (and often with Chris) had watched the X-Files religiously for years &#8212; often in our parents&#8217; basements when were in Oakville, with my travelling to Guelph a few times to watch season premieres (and finales) when we were in university, and sharing stories and theories during the summer breaks. But no more, except in reruns.<br />
Today was &#8230; pretty much a nothing day. I needed to come in to work, but couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it. I forced myself outside for a couple of hours, but soon found myself wanting to go home again. It was a warm day, but hazy &#8230; the Weather Network put it down as &#8220;smoke&#8221;, but from what I don&#8217;t know &#8212; the mountains are still thawing out.<br />
Another week is underway, and it brings me another week closer to changing my life. I, for one, can&#8217;t wait.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p>Maybe this is forever,<br />
Forever fades away,<br />
Like a rocket ascending into space,<br />
Could you not be sad,<br />
Could you not break down,<br />
After all I won&#8217;t let go,<br />
Until you&#8217;re safe and sound.<br />
&#8212; &#8220;Safe and Sound&#8221;, Sheryl Crow</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, a dream came true. Today, Chris left on his jet plane; destination: Narita International Airport, Japan. For the next 365 days, he&#8217;ll live in a different country, a different culture, and experience something that many of us never will.<br />
Last Thursday (9 May 2002) was Chris&#8217; first attempt. This was a bit of a false start, which we could only owe to a fair amount of miscommunication.<br />
Chris, Kaz, and I arrived at the airport just after 9:30 that morning, and wheeled Chris&#8217; copious amount of heavy luggage to the check-in counter. The clerk took Chris&#8217; ticket, and started the process to get him all set to go. However, part-way through checking him in, she noted something odd. Chris only had a one-way ticket. This prompted the following discussion:<br />
Clerk: Going to Japan?<br />
Chris: (Excitedly) Yes.<br />
Clerk: Are you going to work in Japan?<br />
Chris: Yes, I&#8217;m going to teach English.<br />
Clerk: Where&#8217;s your visa?<br />
At this point, my heart sank. I think Chris&#8217; started to, but he quickly started telling the clerk about the arrangement he had with the company. As far as Chris understood it, there was a visa with his name on it, just waiting for him in Japan. However, as the clerk knew it, Chris would not be allowed into Japan without a visa, and without a round-trip ticket he would be viewed as an immigrant, rather than a tourist. Without a work visa, Chris would be denied entry &#8230; and Air Canada would be fined $10,000 for sending someone without proper papers.<br />
Chris started making (somewhat frantic) phone calls to the Canadian branch of his company, based in Montreal. I&#8217;ve known Chris for half my life. But I have never seen him look as despondent as he did when the truth slowly started to form. It was becoming quite clear that Chris would not be going to Japan that day.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where I was really impressed. Air Canada is notorious for being the worst airline in Canada when it comes to service. Well, not only did the clerk retrieve Chris&#8217; bags (she had sent two down before realizing that there was going to be trouble), but she also managed to convert Chris&#8217; non-changeable/non-refundable ticket into a changeable ticket, where the issuing agent would &#8220;refund&#8221; the price and immediately roll it over into a round-trip open ticket.<br />
Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s *supposed* to happen: Chris is to travel to Japan with an open ticket. He can enter the country as a tourist for 90 days on a &#8220;tourist visa&#8221;. (Doesn&#8217;t actually exist, but that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s referred to as.) Once he&#8217;s in the door, he can convert his &#8220;tourist visa&#8221; into a work visa. This is the way his company operates, mostly because they get teachers on short notice, and don&#8217;t have three months to wait to clear visas from the originating country.<br />
So Chris got to spend nearly an extra week in Calgary, with his fiancée, and with his friends. After he got his new ticket, it suddenly seemed more real than it had the first time. It was almost like I knew that he wouldn&#8217;t actually leave the first time &#8212; that something would keep him here. Today, it was real. Today, I knew I would see him walk through security, and not come back.<br />
Chris, Kaz, and I arrived at the airport shortly after 9:00 (his flight to Vancouver left a half-hour earlier than the previous one). This time, checking Chris in took about 15 minutes &#8212; less than three of which were at the counter. Boarding pass in hand, all we had to do was wait.<br />
Just after 10:00, we proceeded to the gate to show Chris off. It was just the three of us. I had always imagined this giant throng of friends who would be wishing him off, causing a massive traffic jam of people. But it was just us. I think I actually preferred it that way.<br />
It was a lot easier seeing Chris off than I thought it would be. It&#8217;s probably because Chris and I know each other so well now that it really doesn&#8217;t matter where we are &#8212; halfway around the world is a short distance for people so close to each other.<br />
Chris and Kaz, on the other hand, weren&#8217;t quite as easy. I can&#8217;t blame them &#8212; deeply in love, recently engaged, and the single largest test of distance just beginning. But they&#8217;ll have others for support, and the knowledge that Chris will be coming back.<br />
I suppose the whole thing hasn&#8217;t fully hit me yet, though. I&#8217;m going to go home to what&#8217;s now just my apartment. No roommate. (Not counting the cat, that is.) No-one to talk to. No-one to laugh with. No-one to watch bad movies and rhyme off childish one-liners with.<br />
A little over two years to the day that Chris arrived here, Chris left. The day he arrived, I felt an intense anger that I was cohabitating again (I hadn&#8217;t gotten over the ex-girlfriend issues at the time). Now I can&#8217;t imagine not living with him. But I know that while he may be gone, he&#8217;s still there. And he always will be.<br />
God speed, dear friend.</p>

		<p>Ever tried to catch a thrown brick? It ain&#8217;t easy. First, you prepare for the heavy weight, which often has sharp edges, and then you try to position your body so that you can buffer the shock and try to prevent bodily harm. But in almost every case, you end up dropping it because it&#8217;s a lot heavier than you think it is.<br />
Such is what happened to me last evening. It started innoculously enough &#8212; a simple phone call from Chris. Well, &#8220;simple&#8221; in its simplest meaning, but loaded with a lot of &#8220;something big&#8221;. It went like this:<br />
Me: Hello?<br />
Chris: Hey man, what&#8217;s up? (Standard opening to a phone call for us.)<br />
Me: Not much, the usual hell of my daily life. (Standard answer to the question.)<br />
Chris: You doing anything tonight?<br />
Me: Nope. (Knowing full well that I was supposed to meet with an insurance agent, who never ended up showing.)<br />
Chris: Great! Kaz and I would like to meet you for coffee.<br />
That&#8217;s when my &#8220;Danger Will Robinson! Danger!&#8221; alarm went off. Chris has never, EVER, asked me to go for &#8220;coffee&#8221;. And if he would ask, the question would be posed as follows: &#8220;Wanna grab a coffee after work?&#8221; or something similar. The question was too formal, and loaded with the &#8220;Kaz and I&#8221;. Immediate thoughts ran through my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kaz is pregnant.</li>
<li>Chris has decided not to go to Japan, and is moving in with Kaz.</li>
<li>Chris and Kaz got engaged.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m overreacting, and it&#8217;s nothing.</li>
<li>Kaz is going to Japan with Chris. (She&#8217;s Japanese by birth, so it&#8217;s not *that* big of a stretch.)</li>
<li>After I move to my new house, Chris is hoping I might take Kaz in as a roommate.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve eloped and are married, bought a house, and Kaz is pregnant with twins. (Like with all things I do, even my paranoia follows the adage: Go big, or go home.)</li>
</ol>
<p>These flitted through pretty quickly, and none stuck. I figured it was just Chris being a little strange because of having a new girlfriend (Chris sometimes gets like that).<br />
That evening, I ducked out shortly before 6pm and headed home. I was hoping to meet up with the building manager to try and swing a May 31st departure. But the manager I needed to talk to wasn&#8217;t in. I instead went up to the apartment for a few minutes before heading out to meet up with Chris and Kaz at the Starbuck&#8217;s on 17th Ave. (which was where I was supposed to meet the absent agent) for 7pm.<br />
Although I didn&#8217;t notice it at the time, Chris was a little &#8230; nervous. And for good reason. We took up a seat next to the fireplace, and almost immediately Chris and Kaz held out their left hands. On their ring fingers were matching (but differently sized) plain white gold rings.<br />
Number three.<br />
There are few things that will shock me. There are few things that will surprise me. There are even fewer things that will stun me so completely that for about a minute I can&#8217;t think of anything to say. I finally had to force out &#8220;My most sincere congratulations&#8221; and stifle the &#8220;Are you out of your collective minds?!&#8221;.<br />
Once we&#8217;d gotten by the uncomfortable silence that followed the &#8220;announcement&#8221; (it took a little while for it to sink in), I had to start asking questions. As one of Chris&#8217; friends, one of my responsibilities is to be his conscience, whether he likes it or not. The trick is not to ask questions that could be construed as insulting. Chris knows me well &#8212; I can ask him literally anything and he&#8217;ll understand it&#8217;s just me checking my own sanity as much as his. Kaz, on the other hand, is only just getting to know me. Having caught the dropped bomb, I now had to be careful about laying the landmines.<br />
A lot of people would sit back and suggest that they&#8217;re moving too quickly (which is a perfectly valid thought), that they haven&#8217;t thought things through, that this is inherently risky (especially since Chris is going to Japan for a year), and there is no way they could possibly know each other well enough.<br />
Any question you ask, they&#8217;ve thought of. They&#8217;ve considered it. There is no fear, no doubt, no hesitation. And above all, there is sensible thought about all of it. That was one of the first things I checked. Having been engaged in the past, I know what kind of pressures they&#8217;ll be under, and having popped the question so soon after meeting each other (about three weeks, by my count), they&#8217;ll be under way more pressure than most.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m totally happy for them. I think it&#8217;s great that they were able to find each other, and able to realize very early in the relationship that this wasn&#8217;t just some iffy thing &#8212; they could see it in themselves that they were ready to be with each other for the rest of their lives. I will be lucky if I have that happen to me. I&#8217;ve seen it a couple of times before, but I guess with my own history, I&#8217;m not too optimistic for myself.<br />
So as if my anxieties about losing Chris weren&#8217;t bad enough, now he&#8217;s getting married (no plans beyond coming back from Japan, sorry). That means more isolation for myself, and the inevitable sound of little feet (though hopefully, no time soon).<br />
I&#8217;m too young for this shit.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Although it&#8217;s very tempting to say that it&#8217;s the beginning of the end &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t really be appropriate.<br />
It&#8217;s no longer a guess, it&#8217;s not a possibility, it&#8217;s not even a plan anymore. It&#8217;s fact. Chris is going to Japan. On Thursday (9 May 2002). For an entire year, he&#8217;ll be teaching children of all ages the fine art of writing, reading, and speaking English.<br />
Be afraid. Be very afraid.<br />
Friday marked Chris&#8217; last day at Critical Mass. It was an emotional day for many people, including myself. Although it does sound a little strange that Chris and I not only work together but live together, you do need to understand that it works very well for us. We don&#8217;t see each other much around the office (we&#8217;re on different floors, different projects, and more times than not, all we get to do is nod at each other), so a lot of the time we see each other is at home, or when we&#8217;re out with friends.<br />
I&#8217;ve known Chris a very long time &#8212; now over half of my life. (I&#8217;ve known Stuart just as long, and Therese not too far off.) I&#8217;ve lived with him for two years. (In fact, Chris will be leaving just a couple days shy of his two-year anniversary in Calgary.) It&#8217;s going to be hard to not have him around.<br />
To mark his departure, we wanted to do something special. We wanted to give him something that he&#8217;d not only remember us (and I&#8217;m not referring to just Therese, Stuart, and myself &#8212; I&#8217;m referring to almost everyone he knows in Calgary), but something he&#8217;d use. Knowing that Chris will be completely overwhelmed by everything he&#8217;ll see and do while he&#8217;s in Japan, I figured the best thing was to give him a digital camera. I threw the idea out to the ABC &#8212; the &#8220;Asian Brother Crew&#8221;, who pretty much all agreed that it was the best thing going.<br />
There were two tacks that we could take &#8212; get him a cheap camera and have a small number of people, or get a good one and include a larger number of folks. Teak and I discussed this at length and decided to &#8220;go big, or go home&#8221;. (Or as my dad would say: If you&#8217;re going to do something, do it right.) So Teak gathered a small flock of people and  raised a small fortune. Although I was prepared to put in the lion&#8217;s share of the cost, I didn&#8217;t have to in the end.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t Chris&#8217; only gift from friends. Jensenne and Jeanette, with photos and blurbs from friends, made Chris a scrapbook to remember what he was leaving behind. It was a great combination of fun, goofiness, old pictures, silly pictures, and a lot of people who wanted Chris to not stay away.<br />
As for the last hurrah, we all agreed that Sakana Grill was the place. Teak made the arrangements &#8212; actually talking to the manager (it&#8217;s a lot easier to have a guy who can speak Japanese to make a reservation at a Japanese restaurant), and reserving enough places for 50+ people. This wasn&#8217;t all just for Chris, though &#8212; this was also for Nathan (in our AppDev department) and Jen (who had been filling in as our receptionist), who were also celebrating their last day at Critical Mass.<br />
We had 43 confirmations on Friday morning. There were at least 60 people when Chris, Tamara, Stuart, and myself arrived.  (Stuart is not Therese&#8217;s Stuart &#8212; this is a new co-worker who&#8217;s trying to get to know people.) We had a hard time sitting in. But we weren&#8217;t the last. We actually overflowed the area we were sitting. It was crazy.<br />
After dinner, the immense crowd broke up, and we ended up with the ABC, plus a couple of others. Plans were loosely set, mostly that Chris had to go pick up Kaz. It was decided that the bulk of the group would go to Cinescape to play video games, and we&#8217;d give them a call when we were more organized.<br />
Who&#8217;s Kaz, you ask?<br />
Kaz is short for Kazumi &#8230; and is Chris&#8217; new girlfriend.<br />
Yeah, he has a girlfriend. It&#8217;s kinda creepy how well they get along, especially considering at the time the two of them hooked up, Chris already knew he was going to Japan. (Kaz, by the way, is Japanese, and has only been in Canada for about a year.) She knew he was going to Japan. But they&#8217;re both serious about each other, to the point where they&#8217;re waiting on each other until Chris gets back a year from now.<br />
We picked Kaz up from the Petro-Canada on 4th St. (she had just come off work) and dropped her off at home. We returned to our apartment where Chris got cleaned up, I tidied the apartment, and then starting calling around to see what people were interested in. The plan ended up with everyone coming over to our apartment for video games and movies. Not particularly original, but still fun.<br />
It would be the last game/movie night in our apartment.<br />
Chris went off to retrieve Kaz as everyone started to arrive. Pretty soon, the living room was full of people yelling and screaming (due to invigorating games of Virtua Tennis). We switched to a movie a little later on, &#8220;Shaolin Soccer&#8221;, which several people hadn&#8217;t seen.<br />
The last game night ended around 2am, with everyone heading to their respective homes. Unfortunately, Chris and Kaz didn&#8217;t get back until everyone was leaving, and missed out on the festivities.<br />
Yesterday, we planned to have the whole crew go down to Chinook Paramount to watch Spider-Man, for a last group night at the movies. I tried to organize this within the span of about 20 minutes, with some degree of success, but in the end (owing to scheduling and communication problems), Chris was unable to come (he has promised to pick up Kaz after work, which conflicted with the movie time). We did luckily end up meeting for tea/coffee/dessert at Bubblemania on 16th Ave.<br />
This morning was one of the big &#8220;lasts&#8221; &#8212; the last dim sum. This was when it finally hit me. The other lasts hadn&#8217;t done anything, but this one left me really thinking about what was going to happen. Although Chris does intend to return in a year (because of Kaz), there will always be the possibility that he may never return from Japan. I had to give a moment of pause when I realized that there was the chance that this is another chapter of my life about to close.<br />
The next few days are going to be odd. They are going to be hard.<br />
But not as hard as the ones that will follow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s official, Mother Nature is bipolar.<br />
North America has been receiving some very erratic weather as of late. Out here, it&#8217;s been a little more consistent than erratic &#8230; consistently bad, that is.<br />
So far this year, we&#8217;ve had about two warm days. Luckily, both on weekends. But here we are, a month into spring, and I&#8217;m still hauling out my winter jacket. Two months ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have cared about that. Those of you who know me reasonably well know that I rather like winter. I like snow. I even like the mind-numbing cold &#8230; for short periods of time, anyway.<br />
But this weather truly sucks.<br />
Take yesterday, for example. I was waiting around for an insurance agent to call. (I&#8217;m looking around for quotes on mortgage insurance, as well as new house insurance. Although this particular agent is more of a favour for a friend, so I don&#8217;t know if it will go anywhere at all.) I was fiddling around with one of my own personal websites when my phone rang. It was Joanne (the agent). She asked me why I was still at work. I asked if we were still meeting (yeah, I know, you should never answer a question with a question, but it was a lead-in for an answer I never got to give). She said it was snowing.<br />
I looked out the window. Overcast, yes. Snow, no.<br />
Snowing? I asked. Yep &#8212; lots of it in the South East. I work in the South East. (Well, barely, anyway.) But there was no snow that I could see. But apparently the weather was getting really miserable. Joanne suggested we hold off until next week. (It was better for her, anyway.) I agreed, and figured I should head out &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t brought a winter jacket, and it sounded like it was going to get really cold.<br />
I took the C-Train &#8212; the wind was just chilly enough to make walking uncomfortable in the jacket I had. In hindsight, it was the best thing I could have done. No more than five minutes after I&#8217;d returned to my apartment did I happen to notice something. I couldn&#8217;t see buildings a block away. It was snowing. Hard. We were having a blizzard.<br />
It&#8217;s Spring. Or at least it&#8217;s supposed to be Spring. But this weather would make you really wonder what month it is. Were it not for the fact that it gets dark much later in the evening, you&#8217;d almost swear it was December. And even if the groundhog did see his shadow, we should be well in the clear by now.<br />
Spring never sprung here &#8212; it&#8217;s still frozen stuck.<br />
This is going to be a bit of an odd year for weather, I think. I&#8217;m not sure if this is an effect of El Nino (supposedly back on the rise again) or of global warming (which really isn&#8217;t proving itself out here). We&#8217;re probably going to see a cooler west, a hotter and more humid south (we should probably expect a Class 5 hurricane), and probably a few more violent weather shifts across the continent. Heck, we might even see a tornado around Cowtown.<br />
So if you see good weather this year, get out in it while you can. If you blink, you might miss it&#8230;</p>
