	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Minus 34. Celsius. (Not that it would matter much more if it were Fahrenheit.) That&#8217;s 14 degrees below my thermal underwear threshold (that would be when I put them on). That&#8217;s what it was on my way to work this morning.<br />
What the hell is going on around here?<br />
Calgary has been in the grips of a deep freeze since about the beginning of the year. My longjohns haven&#8217;t seen the drawer for weeks. Going outside is a serious consideration, namely, how many layers to wear? One of my co-workers (Scott) has been wearing googles to prevent his eyes from freezing.<br />
This makes the pain in my left shoulder all the more poignant. What&#8217;s it from? Injections. Specifically, vaccines for Hepatitus A, B, and a tetanus booster. All of these I got last night at the Bowmont Travel Clinic.<br />
Why? Because next Wednesday morning, at 06:45, Alex and I will be winging our way down to sunny (and considerably warmer) Costa Rica.<br />
I haven&#8217;t been any place warm since 1996 (when I did a trip around the southwestern United States with my friends &#8212; see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States]]), and I haven&#8217;t been south of the United States since about Grade 10 or 11 (when my family went to Akumal, Mexico). I&#8217;ve never been to Costa Rica, and I&#8217;ve heard nothing but good things about it. Frankly, it sounds like a lot of fun.<br />
We&#8217;re starting off in the capital, San Jose. We&#8217;ll be there for two nights before heading out to Arenal, noted for the Arenal Volcano, the most active in Latin America. (Relax, it&#8217;s not a pyroclastic volcano, like Mount. St. Helens or Mt. Soufriere in Monserratt &#8212; it&#8217;s more like Kilauea in Hawaii.) We&#8217;ll be there two nights before heading out to the Pacific coast and Tamarindo. We&#8217;ll be there for four days, one of which will be Alex&#8217;s birthday (which is the reason we&#8217;re going there in the first place &#8212; she wanted to be on a beach in January &#8230; and who am I to refuse?). Then we&#8217;re back to San Jose for one more night before flying out.<br />
All of this brings me back to the injections. You&#8217;ve no doubt seen that commercial of that tasty-looking tropical drink where the narrator tells you about the Hepatitus A in the ice cubes? Latin America, even Costa Rica &#8212; which is by far the healthiest of all the Latin American countries &#8212; have high Hepatitus risks. Alex is already up to date with her shots, so it was my turn to get a couple pricks.<br />
All three of them.<br />
Why three? Well, when I talked with the clinic doctor (a requirement &#8212; you can get the shots with a meeting), she informed me that I had to get separate A and B shots (I was too late to get Twinrix before leaving), and while going through the list of things I should receive, she also suggested that I update my tetanus, which is a couple decades out of date. (You know you haven&#8217;t seen a doctor in a long time when&#8230;)<br />
I hate needles. Really hate them. But I seem to hate them less now than I used to. It&#8217;s probably the flu shots that I get that help me. The more shots I get, the less I seem to hate them.<br />
Except for Hep A. When the nurse was injecting me, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice the fact that she wasn&#8217;t stopping. For a moment, I thought that she&#8217;d accidentally hooked me into a garden hose and was flooding my arm. Turns out that the Hep A shot is a full millilitre. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, right? That&#8217;s quite a lot more than the average. And it HURTS. I actually felt nauseated. (Not that it takes much for me and needles.)<br />
One down, two to go. I had to breathe a few moments before getting the next two.<br />
They were smaller, and went in quick succession. I hopped off the table and had to almost put my head between my legs to let the colour flow back to my head again. I have no idea why on earth needles make me feel this way. I hate that.<br />
The nurse warned me that my shoulder might hurt the next day. &#8220;The <em>NEXT</em> day? It hurts right now!&#8221;<br />
So this morning, I wake up to -34 degree weather. My shoulder is just shy of severe agony. I can&#8217;t raise it. It&#8217;s a dull ache that won&#8217;t go away. I can&#8217;t even lift a can of pop without flinching. Putting on my jackets (outer jacket with a fleece jacket for extra protection) is an ordeal.<br />
But I just keep telling myself: There&#8217;s a beach in this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been getting this question from my colleagues lately, and I think it&#8217;s a valid one to ask. The fact that it&#8217;s being asked shows that people are thinking about best practices and how to best meet the needs. However, the fact that it&#8217;s being asked also shows that people really don&#8217;t understand a fundamental principle of web standards.<br />
How do <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">web standards</a> and Javascript get along? How do you employ Javascript that is web standards-compliant? It&#8217;s a tough question, and so far, I haven&#8217;t come across a clear answer.<br />
A properly-developed, web standards-compliant site (or even just a page) should have <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/separationdilemma/">separation: content, presentation, structure</a>, and function. A quick recap on those: content is the important information on a page (primarily text and images), presentation is how that content should appear to the user, structure is the HTML that defines the various parts of the page that the content falls into, and function (or more specifically, functionality) is the browser scripting that drives some of the interactive features on a site.<br />
The first major break was between content and presentation. Then came structure. These were culiminated with the creation of the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>. Given, the textual content is baked into the Garden&#8217;s code, and the separation between presentation and structure is trivial. (As a side note, the <a href="http://sidesh0w.com/projects/wdw2004/">marriage of the items</a> is just as important as the separation.) This was great stuff. And even though the Garden&#8217;s been around a few years, now, the movement is just getting to the fourth and final piece: function.<br />
And make no mistake, folks, <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/03/14/the-return-of-javascript/">this storm is coming</a>.<br />
But what does this mean for you, the developer? Thankfully, it&#8217;s not too complicated, at least from a comprehension perspective. Implementing? Well, that&#8217;s another issue.<br />
Under the idea of separation for web standards, Javascript should be separated from the page upon which it acts. This means no in-page Javascript, including <code>onclick</code>, <code>onmouseover</code>, <code>onload</code>, or other such event-driven methods. Code is placed into one or more external files, which are then loaded by the browser. This is the same way presentation is/should be applied to each page.<br />
Naturally, this is a little worrisome to developers, since many of us have become very dependent on having that functionality. If we don&#8217;t have those methods in-line, how do we control the functionality? We&#8217;re used to slapping in an onclick event on <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> tags to solve our click event patterns. Never mind the countless <code>onmouseover</code>/<code>onmouseout </code>events we use for effects.<br />
Introduce self-awareness. At least insofar as Javascript methods can be self-aware, anyway. Instead of HTML elements having code to handle the event, a Javascript loaded through the <code>onload</code> event finds HTML elements through the Document Object Model (DOM) and inserts the appropriate handlers into the various elements. It&#8217;s transparent to the user, and a Javascript developer can modify method behaviours without ever touching the HTML structure.<br />
Loading up the <code>onload</code> event, however, is not a wise idea. Not only is it ugly, eventually the call will become so long that you won&#8217;t be able to maintain it. Introduce the onload handler. With a simple piece of code, you can set up a method stack that calls other Javascript methods. The methods are popped and pushed as needed, defined by a controlling function or static list. A very simple version &#8212; an array &#8212; would look like this:<br />
<code><br />
function onloadEvents() {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for(var i=0; i&lt;loadarray .length;i++) {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eval(loadArray[i]);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
}<br />
</code><br />
Very simple, very crude, but it works. (Too many <code>eval</code>s can slow down a script dramatically, so don&#8217;t get carried away.) Events are added to the onload handler through array declarations:<br />
<code>loadArray[loadArray.length] = "functionName()";</code><br />
A smarter script creates an object list of items, calling them in turn.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: that&#8217;s a lot of extra work. It is, and it isn&#8217;t. It is because you have to think about how your page is built, and how functions would recognize the patterns needed to build your events. For example, if you&#8217;re using a structure for menus or have a specific classname for a link, then it&#8217;s not so bad. You create a method that can initialize that structure, applying whatever functionality is needed for the specific purpose. It&#8217;s run just once, and provided the method isn&#8217;t too complicated, runs quickly.<br />
Where additional work comes into place is the need to build the initialization methods and set up an onload handler (such as above). Once it&#8217;s done, though, the rest should be relatively easy.<br />
This is all in theory, and is something that I think about a lot. There&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;what-ifs&#8221; to consider. My personal favourite is: What if this is a one-off situation? Do I spend the time and code to build a one-off onload handler? This is the one I usually end up stumping myself on.<br />
In CSS, one-offs aren&#8217;t such a big deal. You create a single class, set up the formatting, and let the browser apply it as needed. But Javascript doesn&#8217;t apply automatically. It needs to attach itself, not unlike a leech (just not so bloody). And that&#8217;s where you can get caught. Do you take the side of lighter Javascript files and run the method in the HTML, thus defeating the idea of separation? Or do you follow the perceived standard and risk code bloat?<br />
It&#8217;s a question I keep asking, and so far, I&#8217;ve yet to find an answer. The <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/javascript/">zen of Javascript</a> and web standards is coming. The question is: who will find the inner peace first?</p>

		<p>2004 wasn&#8217;t exactly what I&#8217;d call a tumultuous year, but it was certainly marked with some pretty big events for me, not the least of which was meeting Alex. If there was a number one in the list, she would be it. 2005 is already looking to be an interesting year, since there are a lot of things that will be happening for me.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s an interesting start to the year, to say the least.<br />
Alex and I spent the holidays partly apart. As such, we ended up having Christmas Eve on New Year&#8217;s Eve. To make it interesting (as if being together wasn&#8217;t interesting enough), Alex pulled a scavenger hunt on me, sending me around her condo trying to find the various presents she&#8217;d stashed. Each had a clue to the following present. I can amount it either to my extreme intellect [insert derisive laughter here] or to the obviousness of the clues [Alex knows her audience, to say the least], I managed to find them all without being stumped.<br />
The let down wasn&#8217;t in the presents, but in the crappy countdowns. We just couldn&#8217;t get interested in them, and it&#8217;s really lame to be watching the Times Square countdown when it happened two hours earlier. And out here, it&#8217;s -41 with the windchill, so going outside really isn&#8217;t an option for us.<br />
That&#8217;s probably why we slept in on New Year&#8217;s Day. I forced Alex to stay in bed while I made breakfast. But I couldn&#8217;t keep her in bed forever, especially when there&#8217;s a 20x rewards sale on at Shoppers Drug Mart. It was a 10-block walk in -21 degree weather (not counting the wind chill). Warming up actually hurt. But for 20x points, I&#8217;m sure Alex would go through pretty much anything. The hot chocolate at Second Cup made the walk back considerably easier.<br />
The big things that happened over the holidays: Wedding planning. And yes, that also means something else obvious: Engagement. (Yes, I know you saw it coming.) This time, I know it&#8217;s right.<br />
The funny part is, we started planning for a wedding before we were even actually engaged. We goofed around with a huge number of ideas, including theming it ala Monty Python. We were going to recreate parts of <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> to keep it interesting and humourous. Whether or not we stick to this come August remains to be seen, of course. Funny as it is, I have my doubts that we&#8217;ll actually do it.<br />
A stop at Michael&#8217;s over in Westhills supplied paper, ribbon, and various crafts to make invitations. Alex is far more craft-oriented than I am, and wants to make the invitations. (I&#8217;d just as soon whip them up on a computer and have them mass produced.) We started working on prototypes at Alex&#8217;s later in the afternoon.<br />
This is when the Big Event happened. When I was back home, I picked up the engagement ring. It was Mom&#8217;s, and my grandmother&#8217;s before that. It&#8217;s a Sowrey heirloom now, and something I wanted to pass to Alex. A bit of a risk, mind you, since Alex had certain expectations in mind for what she wanted, and I was about to deliver something she hadn&#8217;t previously considered.<br />
As I was tying a ribbon into one of the prototypes, the idea hit me. I had the ring in my pocket. While not the most romantic place to conduct this, it was private (which I was sure Alex would prefer) and related directly to what we were doing. A snap decision, in other words. Tying it in was difficult, but when it was finally attached, I held the card up to show her, and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think?</p></blockquote>
<p>She was a little stunned, mostly because I think at first she didn&#8217;t really see the ring, and then had to contemplate how the heck I&#8217;d gotten a ring without her knowing, followed by having to accept that she was getting it without expectation and that it was decidedly different than she had wanted.<br />
I had wanted to do this for her birthday later in the month, when we go to Costa Rica. But Alex told me two things: 1) she wanted to tell her friends at a Stitch &#8216;n Bitch before we left, and that 2) she liked her birthdays to be special and without complication. In other words, she didn&#8217;t want to get engaged on the same day. How&#8217;s that for putting a wrench in plans?<br />
When Alex finally realized what it was, I looked at her and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Only one catch: It comes with me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s me, Mr. Romantic&#8230;<br />
We ate dinner together and celebrated with wine. But I had to go home afterwards to prepare for the next evolution in my job. I&#8217;m down a strong developer and need to backfill, and Cory&#8217;s shift to client services means I&#8217;m now the Web Development Practice Lead.<br />
It&#8217;s going to be an interesting year&#8230;</p>

		<p>I had hoped to go some place warm for the Christmas holidays this year. I wanted to put Christmas lights on a palm tree. I wanted to make sandmen. I wanted nothing more to worry about than getting a sunburn on Boxing day.<br />
So naturally, I ended up arriving at Pearson International Airport at 6:30 on the morning of 23 December, catching the end of a nasty two-day snowstorm. There&#8217;s poetic justice in this, somewhere.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think Alex and I need to stop packing so much into a single weekend. It&#8217;s gonna kill us.<br />
Friday night was Light Night. Being fairly warm (thanks to a chinook), we went out in search of Christmas lights around town, camera in hand. There&#8217;s a lot to choose from, but one thing Alex and I noticed about Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people with too much money, and too cheap to put up lights. Something I think Alex and I will definitely work against next Christmas with our home.<br />
We went around Glamorgan, Altadore, Garrison Woods, through another section of the city I can&#8217;t remember the name of, all the way out to Discovery Ridge, and then finally into Springbank. There were only a few places that had anything of consequence. One was a string of houses in Glamorgan on a cul-de-sac that took the whole idea of Christmas lighting very seriously. That was our first stop. Ironically, it wasn&#8217;t until our last (Springbank) that we really saw something noteworthy. First were two houses on the hill (we saw them from Discovery Ridge) that had a lot of lights in the rear. Then we saw a couple houses with &#8220;ME&#8221; and &#8220;IS&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t until we took a wider look that several houses had similar letters: ME, RR, YC, HR, IS, TM, and AS. (Although the &#8220;RR&#8221; was out that night.)<br />
But one house took the biscuit. You couldn&#8217;t see their front lawn for all the lights, toys, balloons, cutouts, and whatnot erected all over it. The light was enough to be almost blinding. No music, though, so at least the sounds wouldn&#8217;t drive neighbours crazy, but the whole setup was just &#8230; well, either amazing or ridiculous. Take your choice.<br />
Saturday was a busy day, right from the start. Alex was working, having volunteered (one of four) to help out with a laboratory exercise, to help surgeons learn a new spine operation method. (Paid, of course.) This meant a (relatively) early start, and a long day in front of an x-ray machine.<br />
We went to Denny&#8217;s on 16th Ave, just east of Crowchild, for breakfast with her co-workers Andy and Fred. (Andy is an x-ray tech, like Alex; Fred leads the Quality Control (QC) effort, whom Alex works with every Wednesday.) All three (there were four in total) were working in the lab. I was just along for the big breakfast. It was my first chance to meet Fred &#8212; I finally have a face for all the stories I hear from Alex.<br />
Following breakfast, the three of them vanished off to Foothills (the hospital, not the mountains) and I headed up to Crowfoot Centre, to pick up my car. (Mini Canada had called in my car for a voluntary recall to upgrade my emissions.) This is about where my rather tiring day began.<br />
First off, I somehow managed to arrive at the Banff Trail C-Train station with a mere dollar in change. (You need two for the ticket to ride.) Don&#8217;t you just hate being in that really uncomfortably position of needing an extra bit of change, and all you have is a dollar? Luckily, one of the other patrons there offered to change my $5 bill, and then gave me a dollar after realizing he didn&#8217;t have enough for the change.<br />
I love Calgarians.<br />
It was a bit windy at the station, but the Weather Network had said that we&#8217;d have a reasonably nice day. By the time I got to Dalhousie station, it was much windier, with snow pellets. I boarded a bus to take me to Crowfoot &#8212; the #147. When I got off at the Burger King there, I was staring into a wall of white. When I walked into the Chapter&#8217;s there about five minutes after getting off the bus, the front of my body looked like someone had taken a white paint roller to me.<br />
My car was clean and shiny when I arrived, and was soon on the road. (The salt and sand from Calgary&#8217;s ongoing efforts to beat back winter were soon on my car, rather than the street.) I stopped at Chinook for the purpose of finding a particularly difficult to find present. I&#8217;d seen it there during a shopping spree Alex and I had engaged in to find her a dress, but couldn&#8217;t remember what store. Despite visiting every retailer in the building, I was unable to discover its location.<br />
Thinking that perhaps I had the wrong mall in mind, I whipped down to South Centre. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t seem to matter which mall I was in, the success was the same &#8212; nil. The frustration, not to mention my headache, was building.<br />
But it was time for me to head home. Alex and I were going to the Diagnostic Imagining (Alex&#8217;s department) Christmas party, and I had to get ready. This is when I noticed that my door wasn&#8217;t opening. Again. (See 22 November 2004.) This meant I had to climb in the passenger side to be able to drive. I&#8217;m seriously going to tear someone a new hole for this at the dealership (I had asked them *specifically* to look at this problem.)<br />
I stopped by Alex&#8217;s to get my gym clothes bag that I&#8217;d left there the night before. In doing so, I found yet another suprise. Either the Mini dealership had given me a very nice Christmas present, or some schmuck in the service department had left a battery charger in my trunk. Despite the drive, the door still wouldn&#8217;t open.<br />
I popped home just long enough to grab a memory card with a photo I was printing for someone (a woman wanted a copy for her boyfriend for Christmas). Up to London Drugs. Three hours before I could get it back. By that time, I&#8217;d be at the party, and with the events tomorrow, there was no way I&#8217;d be able to meet up and deliver the photo the next day. I&#8217;d need to find an alternative (I emailed the original and apologized for the delay).<br />
Door was still not working. People were giving me strange looks as I hopped across my front seat.<br />
Alex called not long after I got home. She&#8217;d finished early, and was heading home. I grabbed my things and headed to her place. She needed a massage after a day of moving around the x-ray machine, and with the night ahead, she didn&#8217;t want to be sore.<br />
We arrived at Canada Olympic Park just after 18:15, in plenty of time for the 18:30 dinner start. Mark and Sang had saved us seats (thankfully) at Table 22. (There were a LOT of tables. The DI department is quite large.) People in attendance had dressed in a fairly wide range, from not-quite-casual almost all the way to near-formal ball gowns. I knew a handful of people (folks that I&#8217;d been introduced to at the hospital, or those who&#8217;d also been on the dragon boat team), but the majority were strangers.<br />
Colette was the ring leader, and made most of the announcements. She also called tables, the numbers drawn at random, to go for dinner. Last year, Alex&#8217;s table had been called last. We were fifth or sixth in the list. Roast beef, chicken, lots of sides to choose from &#8212; all very tasty. While we ate, the door prizes were handed out.<br />
This is where my luck truly showed through &#8230; or the complete and utter lack of it. We&#8217;d all put our names in the hat, so to speak, which were drawn at random. You were then given a random prize. I had made the mistake, however, of trusting my table-mates not to dupe me. I went to the bathroom when Colette started collecting the names. When I got back, Alex handed me two pieces of paper, telling me that she&#8217;d missed Colette when she&#8217;d passed by. Colette told me: &#8220;Only once, Geoff!&#8221;<br />
I was confused. What was wrong with missing her? Easy &#8230; Alex and Mark decided to stuff the ballots with MY NAME. So if I got called more than once, *I&#8217;d* be the one who got in trouble. Gee, thanks, guys&#8230;<br />
As it turns out, I shouldn&#8217;t have worried. My luck is that bad. In a 100 ticket lottery, I&#8217;d lose even if I&#8217;d bought 99 tickets. Alex and Mark were dumbfounded. I challenged Alex to draw my name out of the bag within 20 tries. She couldn&#8217;t.<br />
We left not long after 22:30, having both run out of steam. It had been a long day.<br />
Allowing a bit of a chance to sleep in, we ended up rushing to make it to Grace Presbyterian on time. (Yep, another Advent Sunday means another church.) This particular event wasn&#8217;t so much for the service, but for the cantata (a musical composition for voices and orchestra based on a religious text). At Grace, this would be a great event, as it is one of Calgary&#8217;s oldest churches (it turns 100 near year). There&#8217;s a big pipe organ, and a large orchestra was assembled for the performance.<br />
The senior minister, Rev. Victor Kim, performed what he described as his &#8220;shortest sermon of the year&#8221; (received by much laughter), followed by the longest sermon of the year &#8212; the cantata. The choir came down from their perch in front of the organ, to a series of risers in front of the podium. The orchestra geared up, and the cantata began.<br />
It was a 15-song concert (including the closing hymn of &#8220;Joyful and Triumphant&#8221;), with most of the song sung by the main choir. (The children sang two of the songs.) The entire choir participated, although several of the songs had solos. I&#8217;m not sure if the soloists were part of the regular congregation &#8212; if the are, then Grace has some seriously gifted singers in their midst.<br />
The service started at 11:00, and we left just after 13:00. The air was cold and brisk, though not nearly as bad as the nasty cold snap we&#8217;d had a few days earlier (minus 20 is not pleasant, I don&#8217;t care who you are). We were going to go for tea at Steeps, but ended up hitting Janice Beaton (for lavender shortbread and some really nice cheese), then ended up stopping at a few stores and restaurants before getting to Fiore&#8217;s for a late lunch. Stops at several more stores (including Gravity Pope and Reid&#8217;s) took up enough time that getting tea wasn&#8217;t really an option anymore. We were wiped.<br />
We rested a while at Alex&#8217;s before I went out again to go pickup Jen. Jen turned 16, and I had not yet got her a birthday present (yes, I know, I&#8217;m a lousy cousin). So I took Jen out for dinner, a couple games, and ultimately (which was the original reason) to see &#8220;Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence&#8221;, a Japanese anime film about &#8230; hmm, actually, I&#8217;m not going to describe it. That&#8217;s an entire email onto its own.<br />
Alex, sadly, was not able to come out, which would have been good. I could have used her skill to help defeat Jen at air hockey. Mind you, that could have been retribution for the embarassment of letting Peter (at Sumo) know it was her birthday. There&#8217;s nothing like a bunch of Japanese wait staff singing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; and &#8220;I Just Called (To Say I Love You)&#8221; &#8212; loudly &#8212; to make you feel like the centre of attention.<br />
The movie was long, but good. I think I need to see it again to really wrap my head around it, though. The basic plot line was easy enough to follow, but some of the more intricate details were &#8230; well, reading subtitles and follow action with deep dialogue isn&#8217;t easy.<br />
It was late when I finally got home. I was tired. Really tired. It&#8217;s been a long weekend. And it&#8217;s going to be a long week.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a while, hasn&#8217;t it? No, I&#8217;m not dead. I wasn&#8217;t abducted by aliens. I wasn&#8217;t held hostage. I took a bit of a break. I had to.<br />
In mid-September, I suffered a bit of a breakdown. Too much stress that I&#8217;d allowed to work into my life caught up with me and brought the Geoff Sowrey Machine to a grinding halt. Thankfully, that didn&#8217;t last too long, and was able to get back up and running not long afterwards. So why did I take such a long break before writing again?<br />
Well, one thing that bucket o&#8217; stress did was really hamper my ability to write and edit properly. I was afraid that such a thing was happening, but didn&#8217;t really think it was harming me. Sadly, after one particular entry about my cousin Pam&#8217;s wedding, it became all-too-clear that my ability to write was in jeopardy. I unintentionally insulted my family &#8212; a grievous error for which I am deeply regretful. That brought an end to my writing, at least until I felt competant enough to write again.<br />
Which brings me to this weekend&#8230; (relax, events of weeks, er, months past will be brought to the web as soon as I can edit them all together)<br />
The weekend couldn&#8217;t have started soon enough for me &#8212; last week was almost nothing except planning, strategy, writing, and a lot of stress (long story, which I&#8217;m not really going to get into, suffice to say that the issues were resolved). Friday night was nice: a couple of beers starting at 16:30 (we celebrated a &#8220;No-one Got Fired&#8221; day), followed by a brief stop to wish my friend Angie a happy birthday. Then it was off home to wash off the smell of &#8220;Fuel&#8221; (where the start of Angie&#8217;s party was) and wait for Alex to come home.<br />
We woke up earlier on Saturday than we had in previous weeks, and immediately got to the task of the morning: breakfast. But we opted for breakfast at Nellie&#8217;s In The Loop; one of the Nellie&#8217;s restaurants, based in Marda Loop. We had thought of going to the Belvedere Diner (across the road), but the lineups pretty much settled that deal. Food in our bellies, we aimed for stop #2: Chinook Centre.<br />
As you already know, it&#8217;s December. It&#8217;s Christmas season. So not only were we looking for presents for others (I&#8217;m not quite done yet), we were looking for outfits for the various Christmas parties that are coming up, most notably the MRT party next Saturday. Alex needed a dress. For those of you who&#8217;ve never shopped for a dress before, you&#8217;d be surprised how hard it is to not only find one that looks good, but doesn&#8217;t scratch your skin (Alex found one that seemed to be made ENTIRELY of sparkles), but also comes in your size. Despite a mall-wide search, we ended up finding one in Sears, of all places. I settled for a new dress shirt and a tie, in colours that would compliment Alex&#8217;s navy-blue and silver outfit.<br />
Although December, Chinook wasn&#8217;t wall-to-wall people when we arrived. However, as we began to head towards the Sears (where we ultimatlely found the dress), we noticed that the population was growing exponentially. Having completed our transactions in Sears, we headed towards the car, and abandoned the mall with all due haste.<br />
Destination? Heritage Park, for their 12 Days of Christmas weekend. (It&#8217;s actually several weekends.) Basically, it&#8217;s the same as the park usually, except the amusement park is closed, the trains aren&#8217;t running, and the theme around most of the buildings is decidedly Christmas. It&#8217;s quite nice, actually, and with a bit of planning, could be something that Alex and I make a tradition. Especially when we have kids.<br />
Yes, we talk extensively about having kids. Prepare for it, folks.<br />
We found some particularly nice things in one store, especially drink mixes (powders for hot apple and cranberry ciders, hot chocolates of various varieties), candies, and fudge (we&#8217;re fudge-o-holics). In an adjoining building, we found a group of calligraphers, who whipped off pretty much anything you needed or wanted. That&#8217;s where we ran into Rebecca&#8217;s mom (who travels in the calligraphy circles in Calgary).<br />
The Wainwright Hotel was open, but the forecast for food was a little bleak. Hot dogs in one room, and an apparent lineup for the other. So we aborted and looked elsewhere, such as the bakery (basically, nothing but cookies), the Club Cafe (didn&#8217;t really hit us), and Gunn&#8217;s Dairy Farm (closed by the time we got there). The roundhouse was also open, though didn&#8217;t have any food &#8212; instead, had a wide range of gift ideas. Most were arranged in international themes, so one would see Christmas from various parts of the world, with little descriptions about that area.<br />
One thing that stood out for me was the description of the true meaning of the &#8220;Twelve Days of Christmas&#8221;. Most people think this is about one person giving presents to another. In reality, it was a song created to help teach the core of Catholicism to children during a period in English history when being a Catholic was considered bad. Like, lock you away for a very long time kind of bad. The practice went on from 1558 to 1829, when Catholics were finally emancipated. Here&#8217;s how the numbers actually break down (text borrowed from Appleseeds.org, &#8216;cuz I&#8217;m too damn lazy to type it all out):</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Day: The partridge in a pear tree is Christ Jesus upon the Cross. In the song, Christ is symbolically presented as a mother partridge because she would feign injury to decoy a predator away from her nestlings. She was even willing to die for them. The tree is the symbol of the fall of the human race through the sin of Adam and Eve. It is also the symbol of its redemption by Jesus Christ on the tree of the Cross.</li>

</ul>
<p>Learn something new every day, eh?<br />
Afterwards, we headed out in search of food. Alex was starting to gnaw on my arm, and I felt it important to keep my limbs intact. As we headed back to the Hotel, we could hear the carolers on the stage belting out song after song. But one of them caught our attention. They were singing &#8220;Linus and Lucy&#8221;, the single-most recognizable tune from &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;.<br />
Yes, singing.<br />
As there are no words to the song, they were singing &#8220;do do do do do do do&#8221;, broken into women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s parts. There&#8217;s a bit after the first two stanzas where all of them sang &#8220;DA DA DA DA!&#8221; and followed the sound of the piano. Alex and I about fell over laughing, it sounded so ridiculous.<br />
All we got at the Hotel was a warm dog (not quite hot), two bags of chips, and a couple of drinks. Unsatisfied, we tried for gingerbread cookies at the bakery. You could have used them to armour-plate a tank. The sheer horrors of food having set it, and our interest waning, we headed off in search of the car, and new shopping experiences &#8230; at South Centre Mall.<br />
South Centre was far less busy than Chinook had been, though we didn&#8217;t make any huge scores (although Alex did find a shawl-like thing (it&#8217;s hard to describe, needless to say) for her outfit next Saturday. Following the mall, we headed over to the adjacent Safeway for dinner fixin&#8217;s and for eggs, to make better gingerbread than the armour plating we&#8217;d had earlier.<br />
Dinner eaten and gingerbread dough cooling, we went to return one movie (&#8220;Bad Santa&#8221;) and rent a new one (&#8220;Monster&#8221;). This became partial entertainment. It&#8217;s been snowing this weekend, and the temperature on Saturday was enough to turn the Edmonton Trail hill into a bit of an ice rink. And that seems to attract every idiot in town to prove that you can, in fact, get up an icy hill merely by putting your foot to the floor and smoking your tires beyond repair. Morons.<br />
We were a little late arriving at church the next morning, owing to the aforementioned cold and snow. (The roads were a little treacherous, and it really doesn&#8217;t help matters when the Calgary Police Service decides to pull someone on Memorial over right at a curve in the road. They caused more accidents than they were trying to stop.)<br />
Why did we go to church? Alex wanted to, for one, but also because I&#8217;ve never seen a Christmas service before. It&#8217;s something new for me, and it&#8217;s a part of Alex&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s fun to share experiences, don&#8217;t you think? Following church, we headed to Market Mall for lunch and, yes, more shopping. (We stopped along the way to drop off a small batch of gingerbread cookies to the X-Ray staff in Emergency at the Foot.)<br />
A bag of clothes (I needed new shirts) and two digesting ice cream cones (from the Marble Slab Creamery) later, we returned to my place via Safeway to make dinner: pizza. Something quick. We were heading out to the Knox Choir Festival at Knox United downtown, and were meeting up with Rebecca at the Tim Horton&#8217;s a block away. Which was good, because it was about -20 tonight. Brrr.<br />
The three of us arrived at the church about 15 minutes before the show started. It was packed, wall-to-wall, including the balconies. We barely managed to find seats in the upper back. The show was recorded by CBC radio for rebroadcast in the Calgary area. It was interesting to watch the various choirs come in and play carols I&#8217;d never even heard of before. Two particular choirs were the Korean Presbyterian Choir (which sang traditional English carols in Korean, and sounded amazing) and the Chinook Show Choir, a collection of older women who sang just beautifully. We, as the audience, sang in between the choirs with the Knox Choir and a really loud organ.<br />
Dad would have loved it.<br />
Oh, and one of those choirs decided to do &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;. Yep, how often do you hear people singing &#8220;Linus and Lucy&#8221; twice in one weekend? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever gonna get it out of my head.<br />
Christmas is definitely here. This is going to be a great Christmas season.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Someone had the brilliant idea to go hiking in Kananaskis. Apparently this person didn&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s almost winter. (And around here, that means it <em>is</em> winter.)<br />
We all started off at Phil&#8217;s on 16th Ave. Alex and I were meeting up with a couple of Alex&#8217;s co-workers for a bite to eat before heading off. Originally, Alex and I weren&#8217;t going hiking. It&#8217;s cold, and that means hiking is &#8230; well &#8230; uncomfortable. Alex had other ideas, and though I didn&#8217;t know what they were, they pretty much excluded hiking.<br />
Breakfast changed those plans. So after finishing, we drove at a break-neck pace to Alex&#8217;s for warmer clothes, then bolted out to Upper Lake in Kananaskis park. Despite the cool weather (about -6), there were a surprising number of people there already. We tried to catch up with the rest of the group, but they were already quite a ways along. (I drive fast, but Andy apparently drives faster.) Alex and I were left to ourselves.<br />
We started from the boat launch and walked all the way around until the sluice gate on the far side near to where we&#8217;d camped in the summer (see [[Birthday Camping in Kananaskis]]). We passed a few people as we walked along, but most of the time it was just us, the breeze, and the cold silence of the mountains. It&#8217;s breath-taking.<br />
It&#8217;s also freezing. I wasn&#8217;t too affected, but Alex&#8217;s chattering could probably be heard for miles. (Kidding, honey &#8212; honest!)<br />
We met up with Andy just before we got to the sluice gate, where we headed to the road. We took the road back to the boat launch, managing to catch up with Andy on his return trip. But instead of continuing to follow Andy back to Calgary, we headed towards Canmore. It was time for another surprise&#8230;<br />
We got a cabin. A small one, nothing fancy. Well, the first one was small and nothing fancy until we&#8217;d realized that he hadn&#8217;t cleaned it yet. We were moved to a more rustic one next door that was slightly more than chilly. The gas fireplace would have to be turned way up to make it bearable.<br />
There was a party going on in Banff (Bamf!). We had no idea that there was one. We didn&#8217;t even know what it was called until we found someone who explained: WinterStart. Something to make people feel excited about the lack of sunshine (the sun effectively sets about 15:30 due to the mountains) and the cold (even though Banff is often warmer than Calgary).<br />
First up: Fudge. It&#8217;s a tradition.<br />
Then it was winter hats for Alex. This at times feels almost like beating one&#8217;s head against a wall. We&#8217;ll find one for her eventually, I&#8217;m sure. But it&#8217;s gonna take a lot of hats before she&#8217;s happy.<br />
Dinner at Old Spaghetti Factory. It ain&#8217;t what it used to be, and the food did a number on Alex. We ended up abandoning the rest of our meal and headed back to the cabin where I spent my time trying to keep Alex warm.<br />
It was pure irony then that the shower ran out of hot water as I was finishing the next morning. (Ouch.) Back to Banff (Bamf!) for breakfast at Phil&#8217;s, then up to the hot springs to really warm up. More fudge. Dinner was in Canmore &#8212; Boston Pizza.<br />
Extremes of such cold and heat should give one the flu. So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days! </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Shrub is back for another four years. Oh. Joy.<br />
Did no-one realize what kind of moron is at the head of the US Government? I can only guess not, as the United States again voted in one of the most dangerous men on the planet. The guy freaks me out. Arrogant, ignorant, and brash. A bad combination for a politician.<br />
The problem is the Democrats. They need to find someone with more personality than a telephone pole. Kerry, in case you haven&#8217;t noticed, is rather dull. Actually, nix that. Gore was rather dull. Kerry is Xanax incarnate. If you have any hope against charisma (no matter how evil it seems), you need to put in someone who can at least look and sound more than a mere talking head!<br />
Bush had my favourite line-to-hate from politicians: &#8220;America has spoken&#8221;. Spoken. With 51% of the vote. That&#8217;s not really saying much when you consider that <em>every second person voted against you</em>! If that&#8217;s what you call speaking up in a crowd, it&#8217;s no wonder you&#8217;re not listening to your constituents.<br />
Oh, right, you are listening. Corporate America and ill-gotten influence. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Let&#8217;s recap on Bush&#8217;s first term: After 9/11 (and his reputed 40% vacation time), he drums up the support to go after Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Makes a complete mess by forcing out the Taliban and is unable to find the person he&#8217;s looking for. Yells at Canada for not helping. (Take a guess who&#8217;s going to spend decades keeping the peace after you&#8217;re gone, ya yutz?)<br />
Unable to stop Bin Laden, but still needing a victory, goes after Iraq and Saddam Hussein, the &#8220;most dangerous man alive&#8221;.<br />
Hussein. In the Iraqi economic wasteland. Dangerous to whom? Even Israel says he&#8217;s more of a minor irritation externally. He&#8217;s more dangerous to himself with his paranoia and germophobia.<br />
Oh, right. Corporate America. Oil. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Claims of weapons of mass destruction are realized to be mere words: weapons of mass <em>distraction</em> to give Bush the &#8220;right&#8221; to wreak havoc and kill a lot of innocent people. And you think Hussein is dangerous? Boy, look in the mirror sometime.<br />
Yet again, the US has to go in en masse to clean up a puppet they set up before and let run amok. (Witness Noriega and Castro.) Some regimes never learn.<br />
Interestingly enough, the world (courtesy of globalvote.org) voted for Kerry. We hoped that Kerry would be a tad more honest and wouldn&#8217;t be so keen to wage war on another country somewhere. Sadly, given his waffling, the US ended up with a &#8220;devil you don&#8217;t know&#8221; problem. What would Kerry actually do?<br />
So welcome to another four years of hollow rhetoric, shallow lies, and more fodder for late night talk show hosts and documentary filmmakers. Let&#8217;s just hope this doesn&#8217;t go anymore to his head than it already has.<br />
Oh, and I have to ask, what&#8217;s with Americans turning so homophobic &#8212; what&#8217;s the big deal, eh?</p>
