	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging for a number of years now, going at it hand-to-hand combat style until about a month ago, when I took the bold leap to using <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.<br />
The decision to switch was made for two reasons. First, I was having major problems trying to keep up with the level of content. I was writing entries that were on average 2,000 words a shot (with some up over 10,000). Try writing an essay like that every few days. Sure, you can write about what you know, but it still takes time.<br />
And the content was rarely what I&#8217;ve been wanting to focus on. It was mostly events in my life &#8212; boring and dreary to most. What I was wanting to do more of was the ranting about things that I&#8217;d only had a chance to do once in a while. Such a change requires a complete break from the old.<br />
The second reason for going to WordPress was a desire to get away entirely from the creation and management of files, and more to the creation and management of content. I couldn&#8217;t care less for the structure of the directory system, so long as people are able to find and use the content.<br />
It was about then that I had the epiphany, something echoed by <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> during a conversation we&#8217;d had during our run to lunch at Web Design World, and again in her &#8220;The How and Why of Blogging&#8221; session. So at least I know I&#8217;m not on crack.<br />
Here&#8217;s the simple version: Blogs and CMS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management systems</a>) have far more in common than people even realize.<br />
Here&#8217;s the more complex version: Blogs are CMS. For those of you who&#8217;ve been using tools such as <a href="http://www.typepad.org/">TypePad</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, you already know what I&#8217;m talking about. For the rest of you, there&#8217;s a little something to be learned.<br />
There are three tiers that classify most content management systems. (<a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/ContentManagement/Products/">CMS Watch</a> classifies them as Enterprise, Upper Tier, Mid-Market, Low-Priced, Hosted, and Open Source.) Many in the CMS field generally ignore the blog software as being too much of a point solution to do anything particularly useful.<br />
The Tier 1 systems are the 800 pound gorillas of the industry. They include <a href="http://www.vignette.com/">Vignette</a>, <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/">Interwoven</a>, and <a href="http://www.documentum.com/">Documentum</a>. Licences start at US$300k and go up &#8230; fast. Unless you&#8217;re dealing with huge amounts of content and have staff whose sole responsibility is the creation and maintenance of that content, chances are this is something you can skip right over.<br />
Divisions between Tier 2 and 3 I don&#8217;t fully understand, nor do I pretend to. I&#8217;ve read materials and talked with representatives from companies that place their products in both categories, but the product set isn&#8217;t comparable. Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/default.aspx">Content Management Server</a> seems to usually fall into Tier 2, as does <a href="http://www.hotbanana.com/">Hot Banana</a>. Yet Hot Banana is very close to <a href="http://www.marqui.com/">Marqui</a>, which seems to be Tier 3. Not to mention the near-countless other applications that get thrown into the mix.<br />
What about blogs? Tier 4, if such a thing exists. I don&#8217;t put them in the same class for one basic reason: a lack of workflow. Blogs are meant to post information, though they&#8217;re often personal in nature. In a proper CMS, there is an approval process, where the creator is rarely the one who approves the final version for public consumption. In a blog, the author is also the approver.<br />
Aside from that key distinction, the two systems are very similar: an interface for handling content, a repository for storing that content, and a mechanism for retrieving that content. Vastly simplified, blogs and Tier 1 systems are almost the same.<br />
And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll stop the comparison. Because blogs are not Tier 1, nor will they ever be. If WordPress (my blog engine) were to move to that level of functionality, it would cease to be blog software, and become something else. And it&#8217;s the simple nature that makes blogging not only attractive, but powerful.<br />
For large corporations, blogs are a novelty. Even though <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/">GM</a> and <a href="http://www.boeing.com/randy/">Boeing</a> have high-profile blogs by high-ranking executives, they are marketing tools. Smaller companies, though, could take advantage of the simpler nature of the blog tools by using them to publish their websites.<br />
The benefits are clear: centralized data management, simple interfaces, control over presentation, easy setup and maintenance, and next to no cost. Forget the US$300k licence fee: WordPress is free. You pay for the bandwidth.<br />
Versioning? No. Approval chain? Uh uh. Editorial control? Only if you show the content to an editor first. Does a small company or organization even need all that, though? Chances are, not. Most small institutions have simple needs, nothing even remotely close to what Tier 1, 2, or 3 systems provide.<br />
The next wave of CMS is just about to roll in: blogs as a serious content management system. You won&#8217;t just see it sending out interesting comments. You&#8217;ll see it managing content in small, simple, and highly effective ways. Those who master the blog CMS will find site updates much easier, and will adapt to changing business requirements much more readily.<br />
If you are a solutions provider looking to help a client with CMS, consider your friendly neighbourhood blog. You might be surprised what you can do.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Many years ago, I was turned onto <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a>. Admittedly, without a full understanding of why. At the time, I was hardly in a place to object or complain, and did as I was told.<br />
In the years since then, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the reasons: cleaner, tighter code; better compliancy with standards; better semantics; and most importantly, separation of structure and presentation.<br />
One of the things that XHTML does well is drop support for presentational tags, such as <code>bold</code>, <code>italics</code>, and my personal favourite, <code>font</code> among many. Okay, yes, technically they&#8217;re still in the XHTML 1.0 specification, but they&#8217;ve been deprecated. That&#8217;s enough for me to call them unsupported.<br />
Right now, the <code><br />
</code> tag is still supported, being wholly valid. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve sat on the fence with what to do with it. According to the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>, who defines this stuff, it&#8217;s good. So if I&#8217;m to follow the rules, I would allow use of <code>br</code>.<br />
After today&#8217;s session in &#8220;HTML to XHTML&#8221; (with <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly</a>), I had a bit of a revelation that really sealed the deal for me. As much as others love <code>br</code> for solving problems, there is really no reason to use <code>br</code>, except for legacy reasons. Otherwise, I think it&#8217;s time for <code>br</code> to be retired from the active tag list.<br />
What was the revelation? Show me the semantic meaning. Every &#8220;good&#8221; tag in XHTML has semantic meaning, offering more to the structure of the page than the content it contains. For example, <code>p</code> is a paragraph &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing else it could be. <code>br</code> is a line break &#8212; a <em>presentational</em> construct, nothing else. There&#8217;s nothing else it could be.<br />
Now I know that argument isn&#8217;t wholly suitable. Under that same argument, <code /></p>
<div>would be removed from the list as well -- it doesn't offer any semantic meaning, as it is just a block-level element for breaking up the document. The same goes for .So maybe it's more than that. Maybe we need to consider tags in terms of semantics and document construction. That would allow most tags, with three exceptions:  <code>br</code>, object tags (<code>object</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>img</code>), and <code>hr</code>.<br />
The object tags we have to allow -- they're partly presentational, but they do include content. Naturally, this means an extension of supported tags to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic</li>
<li>Document construction</li>
<li>Content objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I just seem to be finding ways to avoid including <code>br</code>. To a degree, I am, mostly because I want to see its use terminated. I know there are proponents out there who still think <code>br</code> has value. However, in places where you need a line break, it is usually because of formatting.<br />
CSS handles the formatting now -- there's no reason to insert a tag to handle that aspect. So what if you need to create a series of individual lines, like with a poem? <code>br</code> would be perfect for that. That might be a reason for a specific XHTML structure, as that kind of content would require different semantics than regular structures (such as paragraphs).<br />
Mind you, this also brings <code>hr</code> into question. Like <code>br</code>, this seems to serve only a presentational purpose. Yes, you can style it through CSS, even make it disappear. What is its purpose from a semantic perspective?<br />
So <code>br</code> is finally off my "supported list" (just gimme a while to modify the WordPress template to remove it from the rendered code), only to be replaced by <code>hr</code>. Any votes with what to do with it?</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Speaking of bugging, I ran into <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly</a> again as I left <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Dave Bowman</a>&#8216;s presentation for lunch. (I swear Molly, I wasn&#8217;t waiting in ambush for you!) I had meant to ask her this question before Dave&#8217;s presentation, but we broke off as not to miss too much.<br />
Some time ago, Scott had the luxury of seeing a presentation by Molly and <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>. He wrote about a quote they&#8217;d read off:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re writing HTML like it&#8217;s 1993, you&#8217;re doing your job.<br />
<cite>Eric Meyer and Molly Holzschlag</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Molly had read [[Writing HTML like it&#8217;s 1993|my blog entry]] about it, noting that I&#8217;d &#8220;taken them to task&#8221; over the idea. Admittedly, I felt a little low &#8212; who am I to be slagging two of the major standards gurus? I never meant to sound like that! But I can certainly see why I could be coming across as, well, an ass.<br />
The issue I had with the quote is that I don&#8217;t want people, especially folks who are trying to encourage others to develop in a certain way or who have previously used tools and are now hand-coding, to do things the wrong way.<br />
For the record, and this was straight from Molly&#8217;s mouth, the idea of writing HTML like it&#8217;s 1993 is more of a joke than a suggestion. The core idea, however, is still correct: write a document as it was meant to be written. Don&#8217;t try to infuse layout or presentation into something that shouldn&#8217;t have it.<br />
That&#8217;s the problem with a lot of so-called developers out there. They create documents laden with reams of presentation that does nothing for layout, confuses search engines, ruins accessibility, and ultimately causes problems for users (although it&#8217;s easy to argue that it shouldn&#8217;t). If you reset the clock to an earlier period, before all of this garbage was even possible, there is hope.<br />
That spawned off a long conversation about backgrounds, blogging, and education as a necessity within our field as we waited for lunch. Like I said, Molly&#8217;s a great person to talk to. If you ever get a chance to meet her, I highly recommend it.<br />
And sorry, Molly, for sounding like a jerk. At least you know now where I was coming from.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Physicists in New York working on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4357613.stm">created what they believe is a minature black hole</a>.<br />
For the record, this wee beastie lasted 10 million, billion, billionths of a second. No threat to anyone or anything but itself. It collapsed and vanished.<br />
This, however, worries me. It worries me because there was success. There was success in creating a black hole. I don&#8217;t know if this was the goal of the project, but you can be assured that others will try to repeat the scenario, on a larger scale.<br />
And that&#8217;s when things will go terribly wrong.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have a great deal of faith in science as a whole. However, one failing of science has been the ability to take a step back and ask &#8220;why?&#8221;. As in, &#8220;why are we doing thing, what are we trying to achieve?&#8221;<br />
I honestly feel these questions aren&#8217;t asked enough. We&#8217;re playing with forces we claim to understand. We don&#8217;t. We can&#8217;t. There is no black hole anywhere near in our solar system to observe. As it stands, it&#8217;s hard to observe black holes at all, let alone a the distances we seem to be finding them. <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/">Stephen Hawking</a>&#8216;s gone a long way to make calculations about black holes and theorize about their behaviours.<br />
Again, it&#8217;s all in theory. None of it has been utterly proven. And we&#8217;re now playing with a fire that can be far more dangerous than any nuclear device. When humanity started playing with that toy back in the mid-1940s, we did a lot of very dumb things simply because we didn&#8217;t know any better and didn&#8217;t stop to ask the right questions. Many lives were lost before the reality was fully understood.<br />
We don&#8217;t know what the threshold is for a black hole. How large does it have to be to establish itself for longer periods? Hawking believes that black holes eventually dissipate, radiating off the mass they collect as energy. But how long does that take? How large does it have to be to affect the environment around it?<br />
I doubt anyone can answer these questions. And no doubt, the reason for creating black holes will be to answer these questions. The question I ask in return:<br />
What will you say when people die?<br />
That&#8217;s what will happen. Some of science&#8217;s most radical advances (especially with radiation) were gained at the expense of human life. Science becomes too obsessed with finding the result than how to walk the road. Yes, sometimes you do need to sacrifice a few to gain a better benefit for the whole (the needs of the many must outweigh the needs of the few). What happens when the subject of experimentation causes the extinction of the whole?<br />
A little reactionary, perhaps, but I offer you this thought: We can stop a nuclear reaction gone awry. How do we stop a black hole?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When someone decides to stay away from a defined direction, ignoring both precendence and the collective good, they are considered to have gone rogue.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, bastion of monopolistic behaviour in the software world, is known for being somewhat rogue. They defend themselves by saying they&#8217;re blazing new paths. This time, they&#8217;ve gone too far.<br />
Internet Explorer 6 was released in October, 2001 to much fanfare. The hope was that IE 6 would be the one to correct the errors in IE 5.x, some of which were horrible. Sadly, IE 6 failed to live to many expectations, and the web development world would have to wait until future browsers (such as <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>) to find stronger support.<br />
In the last year, we&#8217;ve seen the release of Firefox, and it&#8217;s been good. We have much better (though still not perfect) CSS support. This has allowed us to start thinking about ditching the older code bases and concentrate on the standard development practices we want to use.<br />
Microsoft has allowed <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer</a> to wane, following up only with security updates, and no new version to correct the errors of yore. Naturally, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">news that IE 7 (aka &#8220;Rincon&#8221;) is coming down the tracks</a> has been met with a great deal of interest&#8230;<br />
&#8230;and a little too much dismay. It appears that despite all the progress towards supporting <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS Level 2</a>, Microsoft might decide <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1776290,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">not to completely support</a> it.<br />
This little statement has left a lot of us scratching our heads. Why the heck not?! You&#8217;ve got more than enough time to get it right (correction: you&#8217;ve <strong>had</strong> more than enough time), you&#8217;ve got a strong development team, and for crying out loud, you helped <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.php3">define the freaking standard</a> in the first place!<br />
(For the record, Microsoft is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">member</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>, and Microsoft employee and web development guru <a href="http://www.tantek.com/">Tantek Ã‡elik</a> was one of the editors for CSS Level 2.)<br />
Let&#8217;s not forget that CSS 2.1 has been around for over a year, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/">CSS 2.0</a> was released in May, 1998.<br />
Is it really that hard to implement standards correctly?<br />
The single biggest fear I have is that they&#8217;ll release another browser that requires another set of esoteric hacks to get layouts to work properly because Microsoft refuses to follow the CSS specification properly. Sure, they fixed the <a href="http://www.redmelon.net/tstme/box_model/">box model</a>, but that&#8217;s basic-level stuff. Relative layouts introduce a whole new world of pain.<br />
As a web developer, I don&#8217;t want to see any hacks at all. I want something that is clean, something that interprets CSS the same way as Firefox, <a href="http://http/www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. They&#8217;re compliant. Why can&#8217;t IE be the same way.<br />
Throw in your proprietary extensions. Go nuts. I&#8217;m sure someone will find them handy. But for the love of all things standard, can you please support the existing specification properly? And in its entirety?<br />
(Oh, and would it behoove you to throw in even just a little <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">CSS 3</a> so we can start using that, too?)<br />
In the meantime, <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</a>  and the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> have announced <a href="http://news.com.com/The+Acid2+challenge+to+Microsoft/2010-1032_3-5618723.html?tag=nefd.ac">Acid2</a> to help push Microsoft to do the right thing. The rest of us in the Web Development biz should unite behind them and help.<br />
[Update: 18 March]<br />
An interesting little note came up on <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1776935,00.asp">Microsoft Watch</a>. It seems that a few insiders claim that CSS 2 is &#8220;flawed&#8221;, though they fail to indicate how. As CSS 2.1 is still only a candidate recommendation, Microsoft seems keen to continue on its merry way and do what it wants to.<br />
Just a thought on that, Microsoft&#8230; Netscape tried that once with Netscape 4. Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to elaborate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, early in the morning, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050311.w2jetsgo0311/BNStory/Business/">JetsGo pulled the plug</a>. I&#8217;m not surprised, really. They were an okay airline, not unlike <a href="http://www.westjet.com/">WestJet</a>, but they didn&#8217;t have the following WestJet has. (There&#8217;s Deadheads, and then there&#8217;s Jetheads. I think the loyalty is about the same.) This is why WestJet has survived against the 800 pound gorilla of Canadian airspace, <a href="http://www.aircanada.ca/">Air Canada</a>.<br />
This isn&#8217;t the first time this has happened. And it won&#8217;t be the last. Air Canada has far too strong a hand for such a weak airline. Thanks to our Federal Government being far too kind to this venture, they&#8217;ve been allowed to rack up insane levels of debt, make unbelievably idiotic decisions, and still survive. Any private concern would have folded a decade or more ago.<br />
Let&#8217;s skip back 10 years. There was an airline called <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/canadian-airlines">Canadian Airlines</a>. They were the darlings of the Canadian airline industry &#8212; amazing service, good prices, decent routes. (They were a combination of Canadian Pacific Air Lines, Pacific Western Airlines, Eastern Provincial Airways, and Nordair.) I liked them. A lot.<br />
Air Canada didn&#8217;t. They were the direct competition, and regularly won out against Air Canada for prices. So Air Canada played their trump card &#8212; government support &#8212; and did something any private company couldn&#8217;t have done. They cut their prices. To the level of losing money, and lots of it.<br />
Canadian tried to fight back, but because it was a private company, subject to the reality of the world, eventually started to suffer. I witnessed this every time I flew. First it was the food quality. It went from great, to decent, to passable, to barely there. The last time that I flew with them, I think I got a granola bar. It weighed on the staff, who liked working for that airline.<br />
Canadian was eventually forced to sell itself to its competitor, Air Canada. In a seemingly petty final backslap for daring to challenge the King of Canadian Airspace, Air Canada turned the Canadian Airlines assets and staff into its cutrate airline, <a href="http://www.flytango.com/">Tango</a>. The former Canadian staff are a justifiably bitter lot, and I&#8217;m unable to fly Tango as a result.<br />
<a href="http://www.answers.com/canada%203000">Canada 3000</a> was a bulk carrier. My dad used to call them &#8220;Cattle Car 3000&#8221;. They weren&#8217;t the best airline to fly, but they were the cheapest of the lot. They only flew on certain days and on certain routes. But they supported the charter travel industry quite well, and they seemed to thrive.<br />
Until Air Canada decided that it didn&#8217;t like Canada 3000&#8217;s practices. So they went after them. Canada 3000 was small potatoes. They didn&#8217;t offer any threat to Air Canada. Didn&#8217;t matter, though. Like Canadian Airlines, Canada 3000 tanked because it simply couldn&#8217;t compete.<br />
Air Canada has developed a fairly effective tactic of taking out domestic carriers. First, there was Tango, the remnants of Canadian Airlines. This was Air Canada&#8217;s first attempt to try and take out the other domestic carriers (mostly WestJet). When this failed to acquire enough of the airspace they wanted, another kid entered the field: Zip.<br />
Zip was the cut-cutrate airline. They were to be the WestJet killer, it seemed. Maybe they had some success, though, as they succeeded in driving prices even lower. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be around anymore, though. (Could it be they finally be getting wiser?)<br />
Then there&#8217;s Jazz, the regional carrier. By &#8220;regional&#8221;, that means &#8220;flights to backwater areas of the country that are better served by independent regional carriers&#8221;.<br />
Basically, Air Canada has done an excellent job of spreading itself thin. It&#8217;s like when you pull Silly Putty too far apart, and gaps start to form where the putty can&#8217;t hold itself together. This is where all the money seems to go, I think. And when the gaps become too large, Air Canada goes back to the government for help.<br />
With the fall of JetsGo, it&#8217;s time that Air Canada was cut loose of the Federal umbilical cord. It&#8217;s time that they had to suffer the slings and arrows that everyone else does. It&#8217;s time that Air Canada actually starts to compete with other airlines, rather than drive them out of existence.<br />
In my opinion, here&#8217;s what Air Canada should do: spin off Jazz and Tango (Zip&#8217;s gone, so it seems, so no worries there). Let them either survive or die off as they should, not protected by the Mother Ship. Then Air Canada should drop its domestic flights, save for the long-haul ones (Montreal/Toronto &#8211; Vancouver, Halifax &#8211; Vancouver) and concentrate on international. As an international carrier, Air Canada is great &#8212; I love flying them.<br />
Domestic, I fly WestJet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The dinosaurs died off because they couldn&#8217;t adapt. They couldn&#8217;t evolve fast enough to cope with a rapidly changing environment. As a result, &#8220;dinosaur&#8221; is often an apt description for any entity unable or unwilling to change, and one that will face extinction due to changes outside of its control.<br />
Such is the case with the music industry.<br />
For years, and particularly in the United States, the six companies that control virtually every record label you have in your collection &#8212; no matter how edgy or minor they seem &#8212; have had a stranglehold on how things are done. Their lapdog pitbull, the <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">RIAA</a>, makes sure that people keep in line.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what they want you to believe, anyway. Truth is, the music industry is losing control every day. They don&#8217;t have a monopoly on control. They used to, before personal recorders were invented. First, it was cassette tapes (yes, there was reel-to-reel, but that wasn&#8217;t practical for the average person). That caused a murmur.<br />
Then there were CDs. That got active discussion, to the point of having levies to collect fees to compensate the music industry for perceived losses due to pirating perfect copies.<br />
Then came the internet and MP3s. Panic has ensued.<br />
Technology put in the hands of the public changes everything. It changes how major corporations work. It changes how public opinion can sway governments. It changes how we perceive one another and how we affect our global society. For the music industry, technology went from being a splinter, to a thorn, to an amputation.<br />
We&#8217;re watching the Black Knight from <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/combined">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>, having been thoroughly trounced by Arthur, screaming that he&#8217;ll bite our kneecaps off if we don&#8217;t listen.<br />
We&#8217;ve stopped listening. But only to the music industry &#8212; we&#8217;re content with listening to music. And we want it on our terms, not theirs.<br />
File sharing was the first step. We all know about those lawsuits. Apple and several other companies came up with online stores for selling music at about a dollar a download &#8212; $10 for your average 10-song album. Not too bad, since we don&#8217;t have to find a store that has the most recent album in stock. But is the price right?<br />
Sandy Pearlman doesn&#8217;t think so. A veteran of the music industry himself, he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.globetechnology.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050309/SONG09/?query=mcgill">advocating songs for $0.05</a>. Yes, five cents. Each, of course. Two entire albums (average length) would cost you a dollar.<br />
This is what will save the music industry. They just have to evolve to the new environment. No matter how hard the RIAA tries, no matter how many lawsuits they file, no matter how much lobbying goes on Capital Hill, the music industry is doomed without change. File sharing will continue. Technology will advance and come up with something else. There will always be another <a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/napster.htm">Napster</a> or <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,66792,00.html?tw=wn_tophead_2">Kazaa</a>.<br />
The barrier, which the music industry seems to ignore, is cost. Albums are expensive. New ones run about $17 before tax, at least here in Calgary. Okay, yes, <a href="http://www.umusic.com/">Universal Music</a> got smart and dropped prices to about $10-$12, but that&#8217;s still not enough. People want convenience, and you want the ability to make money.<br />
It&#8217;s economy of scale. I ranted about this when I [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy|complained bitterly about the price of movie tickets]]. The movie chains in Canada sort of got around this by disposing of matinee and Tuesday night cheap movies, and dropped the prices across the board by about $3-$4. It&#8217;s still high, but it&#8217;s better. I&#8217;d love to know if the tactic has worked and profits have gone up.<br />
Music and movies are both entertainment, but they are not the same thing. If nothing else, the last few years have proven that users want individual songs, not entire albums. We&#8217;ll compose our own, thank you very much. We&#8217;ll load them onto our portable music devices and play them in any order and combination that we feel like. So why would the industry think we still want a smorgasbord when all we want is a finger sandwich?<br />
Economies of scale, folks. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. Yes, profits would initially drop because $0.50 is a LOT cheaper than $17. But if you sell 25 times as much music as a result (keeping the theory that music swapping would go down), then where&#8217;s the problem?<br />
Okay, yes, this is all theoretical. But the concept has been proven time and again. The music industry just needs to take notice.<br />
Or face extinction.</p>

		<p>So I noticed white hairs for the first time. I&#8217;m 32 (and a little over a half), and I&#8217;m just getting them, it seems. I can live with that. I mean, I&#8217;ve been losing it on top for about a decade, so having some go white ain&#8217;t that big of a deal.<br />
Except, of course, for <em>where</em> it&#8217;s turning white.<br />
If it were my head, I wouldn&#8217;t mind. Eyebrows, no big deal. I could hack even the beard (which I don&#8217;t see much of, anyway). Body hair would be a little strange, but even then acceptable.<br />
But my <strong>NOSE</strong> hairs?!<br />
I mean, what&#8217;s up with that? Of all the bizarre places&#8230;<br />
No, I don&#8217;t regularly peer up my schnoz to see what&#8217;s going on. It just so happened that I got a cold this week. (A rather light one that did little more than give me the runs upstairs.) That&#8217;s when I noticed something odd &#8212; something white &#8212; and investigated a little further.<br />
What cruel joke on life puts the first hairs to lose their pigmentation up your honker? Whose sick idea what this, anyway? There&#8217;s nothing graceful in nose hair! It&#8217;s utilitarian purpose is to prevent garbage from getting up there. Everything else is mostly for decoration. Figures.<br />
All part of the fun of getting older, I guess.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I read a lot of <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/03/ajax_promise_or.html">blogs</a>. It&#8217;s about the best way I have of keeping up with the trends in the industry. But there&#8217;s one trend out there that&#8217;s really beginning to bother me. A lot.<br />
<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s an acronym/abbreviation for &#8220;Asynchronous Javascript with XML&#8221;. It&#8217;s this supposedly wonderful technique that solves a wonderful array of problems by introducing XML into advanced Javascript methods.<br />
News flash, folks, this ain&#8217;t new. This has been around since <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/02/09/xml-http-request.html">XMLHTTPRequest</a> was introduced with IE 5.0 in March, 1999. (It&#8217;s still not officially standardized by anyone, especially the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA</a>, who until now has kept up with the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-262.htm">specification of the scripting language</a> we generally call &#8220;Javascript&#8221;.) Despite being available for so long, no-one really put it to use until Google slapped in place for <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a>. Suddenly, everyone took notice.<br />
Apparently, having read around a little more about Ajax, I&#8217;ve come to a conclusion that I don&#8217;t intend to ever use &#8220;Ajax&#8221;. I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://www.forgetfoo.com/?p=2&amp;blogid=2965">XMLHTTPRequest</a> when needed, and I&#8217;ll make a point of using advanced Javascript, again when needed. But I won&#8217;t use &#8220;Ajax&#8221;. Because as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it doesn&#8217;t exist.<br />
Okay, yes, it&#8217;s a catchy name &#8212; that I won&#8217;t deny. But is it worthy of the recognition? Hmm&#8230; well, maybe just a little. Enough that it attracts attention and gets people to think about techniques they might not have previously considered. In a way &#8220;Ajax&#8221; will serve the same purpose &#8220;DHTML&#8221; once did.<br />
For those of you newer to the field, &#8220;DHTML&#8221; isn&#8217;t a technology. In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHTML">DHTML</a> mirrors Ajax in many ways. It&#8217;s a technique, and the parts aren&#8217;t all required. DHTML was a marketing gimmick Microsoft came up with to sell the blending of HTML, CSS, and JScript (remember, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t acknowledge Java at all). The idea was that this powerful &#8220;new&#8221; technology would solve a lot of problems.<br />
When DHTML was first proposed, it caught a lot of buzz in the field. And rightfully so, because at the time, most people were mired in <font> tags, bgcolor attributes, and tables for layout. DHTML would solve those woes and turn people towards the standards they were supposed to use.<br />
It&#8217;s odd that Microsoft would be the one to drive many towards standards, especially since they didn&#8217;t formalize any of them. (Though Microsoft did come up with a lot of the ideas that are now the standards .) And change we did, though not entirely to Microsoft&#8217;s urging &#8212; we also have the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> and their efforts to thank.<br />
The effect, however, will likely be the same. Ajax will direct those who&#8217;d never really thought past simple image replacement scripts to now think about making their sites more functional and more engaging than ever before. XML isn&#8217;t a requirement, but it is a convenient part of making it all work. In time, Ajax will likely serve the same purpose DHTML did.<br />
Okay, so maybe I&#8217;ve been a little too harsh. Ajax does serve a purpose. And it will continue to be talked about. I just hope the discussion is intelligent and comprehensible. I want the people reading about Ajax to understand that it is not a silver bullet, and what exactly Ajax does and how they can use it.<br />
Mostly because I&#8217;m sick of seeing &#8220;DHTML&#8221; on resumes, and I&#8217;m not keen to see &#8220;Ajax&#8221; show up there with the same level of ignorance.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My friend <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/">Scott</a> now works for the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">#2 search engine</a>. He definitely earned the privilege to be called for the job.<br />
Recently, he had the luxury of having <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> and <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> visit to give a little talk on CSS2. (Things that will probably never happen here, sadly.)<br />
Anyway, Eric made a comment at the end that <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/content/entries/2005/02/19/writing-html-like-1993">Scott took a strong liking</a> to:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you&#8217;re writing HTML like Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, you&#8217;re doing a good job.<br />
<cite>Eric Meyer</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand where that comment is coming from. Back in 1993, the current standard for HTML was 1.0 (2.0 was only an Internet Draft at the time). That meant that the HTML was exceedingly simple: nothing fancier than the structural elements we needed to build a page. (Tables weren&#8217;t spec&#8217;d until HTML 3.2.)<br />
For the basis of the quote (at least as I understand it, not having actually spoken with Eric Meyer about this), I completely see the need. Keep your (X)HTML simple and don&#8217;t try to use elements for something they weren&#8217;t intended for.<br />
That said, I have an issue with this quote: It&#8217;s using a standard that wasn&#8217;t strict on syntax. The official standard, <a href="http://w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML 1.0</a>, allowed you to create HTML documents that had no closing tags. Though <a href="http://w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/">HTML 2.0</a> took it a step further and listed the closing tags in many cases, it was never really that clear. (I didn&#8217;t get into the habit until the mid-90s, myself.)<br />
Why do I have a problem with that? Eric&#8217;s not suggesting that people should write malformed code &#8212; that much I know without having to talk to him. However, people might construe that malformed code is okay. It isn&#8217;t.<br />
We&#8217;re dealing with a technology that has allowed us to move to strongly define the markup language. The standard I try to follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/">XHTML 1.0</a> (only because not all browsers support XHTML 1.1), and I&#8217;m waiting anxiously for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/">XHTML 2.0</a>) is strict, and blissfully so. Not following that standard leads to breakdown in layouts, and in large documents, more work finding the errors. <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C&#8217;s validator</a> can only do so much.<br />
Some find strictness hard, because it does require discipline. Once you&#8217;ve gotten into the habit, though, is the discipline that bad? If it makes your life easier, if you can code faster as a result (less debugging), and if support becomes less painful, shouldn&#8217;t that be a good thing?<br />
Personally, I&#8217;d rather write XHTML like it&#8217;s 2005 (or 2006, depending on when XHTML 2.0 comes out).</p>
