	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I need a weekend from my weekend.<br />
Every so often, I get involved with a very busy Saturday and Sunday. Not necessarily physically demanding, but no less a drain on one&#8217;s energy level. I&#8217;m fortunate in that I don&#8217;t get caught in those every weekend &#8212; if I felt like I do now every Monday, I&#8217;d start falling sleep on my keyboard.<br />
Saturday was Janine and Dory&#8217;s wedding. Remember that stag I went to a couple of weeks ago? (See [[Stag Party in Innisfail, Strippers in Red Deer]].) Well, this was the wedding that it was leading up to. Chris and I were each other&#8217;s guest. We&#8217;d been slid in towards the end of invitations &#8212; we were more &#8220;fringe&#8221; than most &#8212; assumedly after a few were unable to attend. It was a large wedding.<br />
Although the wedding wasn&#8217;t until 1pm, I was up at 8:30 to get myself ready. I cut my hair (it was looking a little scraggly), showered, shaved, and made a quick run to the Safeway for a card for the present, and bow. We watched a little TV to relax a bit, and then got dressed. It was time for me to try on my new suit.<br />
Yes, I bought a new suit. (For those of you who might not know me as well, this is a big thing for me. Suits and I have had a long-standing animosity for each other.) I finally decided that I was going to get something newer than the pants and jacket that I&#8217;ve been wearing for the better part of 10 years. No, I don&#8217;t regularly wear suits. Don&#8217;t much like &#8217;em, really. Well, actually, I don&#8217;t much like the suits I used to wear. Not really comfortable. This was a chance for me to get a good suit&#8230; a really good suit. In fact, I&#8217;ve been saving up for one for a while.<br />
This started at the beginning of the month. While out for a walk one fine Saturday, I found myself in Grafton &amp; Co., a menswear store in Calgary&#8217;s Eaton Centre. While perusing the store, one of the clerks, Jeff, came up and asked me what I was looking for. I described the situation, and he promptly disappeared, returning a few moments later with some suits. His skill for sizing a customer without a tape measure was amazing &#8212; he was right almost every time (he only missed my neck size by an inch).<br />
It was an all-new outfit. New jacket, new shirt (French-cut cuffs, which means I also had new cuff links), new tie (as much as I loathe and despite ties), new slacks, new belt, and new shoes. I was amazed when I had first tried it on in the store about how good it felt. My previous suits had always been uncomfortable. Even spending the whole day wearing it wasn&#8217;t uncomfortable. As much as I hate to say it, I could get used to something like that&#8230;<br />
Anyway, we made the 1.5 hour trip to Innisfail at a relatively snappy pace up Highway 2. Although I thought we had left at an appropriate time, we were running a little late to get there. As it stands we arrived at just the right time to meet up with Stuart and Geoff (Geoff Ho, one of Therese and Janine&#8217;s classmates, who&#8217;s been on an internship in Minneapolis) to take our seats in the church. While Stuart sat a bit more forward in the church, Chris, Geoff, and I sat towards the back.<br />
The Innisfail United Church is perhaps the smallest church I&#8217;ve been in. Mind you, Innisfail is a small town with five churches, so it&#8217;s probably not that big an issue. Still, the church was 2/3 full of guests. Guests were dressed in varying attire, from formal (which was basically the wedding party), to dressy (which category Chris and I fell into, along with many others), to trendy (which meant that while you had a cool suit, you weren&#8217;t wearing a tie), and all the way down to jeans and a t-shirt.<br />
We were in farm country, after all.<br />
When Dory finally emerged through a door near the altar with the minister, he was deliriously nervous. Almost as soon as he was in place, the music changed, and Therese emerged from the back. (Therese was the Maid of Honour.) He was wearing a rather stunning purple dress, accented with an antique rhinestone necklace she&#8217;d bought a few weeks earlier. A moment later, and Janine came through the door. Her dress was exceptional, rare for wedding dresses, I find, complete with a short train.<br />
The minister led a simple ceremony, following what I assume to be normal United service. (I don&#8217;t know, this was my first United wedding.) It was also my first time at a church with a female minister. The United Church of Canada ordains women now, and it seems that even in some of the more &#8220;redneck&#8221; and &#8220;backwater&#8221; areas of Alberta (those were words I heard used in the same sentence as &#8220;Innisfail&#8221;), female ministers are not shunned.<br />
After the 30-odd minute ceremony, we all filed outside to see Janine and Dory off. They really weren&#8217;t going anywhere in particular &#8212; mostly just for the pictures, at which point they&#8217;d return for the reception that evening. The highlight of their departure was the mode of transportation, specifically their limousine. Now, this wasn&#8217;t any ordinary limo. This was a stretch pickup truck.<br />
No, I&#8217;m not kidding.<br />
This limo can easily hold about 12 people in serious comfort. It still has the truck bed in the rear, and it even has bull horns mounted to the hood. For a rancher, it&#8217;s gotta be the coolest thing to drive away in. Janine and Dory had basically done it as a joke &#8212; it was a total fluke it was even available at the time &#8212; but were loving every second of it. The owner/driver looked the part too, striking a passing resemblance to actor Sam Elliot, though without the Texas drawl.<br />
Left to our own devices, the rest of us tried to figure out what to do next. Though still fringe, Chris and I were &#8220;invited&#8221; (it was more of a general call than a specific invitation) to join the Psychology students (and guests) at the Red Deer Lodge for an afternoon of food, pool, and drinking. We had four and a half hours to kill. It seemed like a good idea, certainly better than spending four and a half hours in Innisfail.<br />
Red Deer is a little nicer in the daytime (looks a little seedy at night). The Red Deer Lodge isn&#8217;t as bad as it sounds, either. It&#8217;s actually a little more upscale than your average Holiday Inn. But the pool hall (attached to the rear of the hotel) wasn&#8217;t open, much to our dismay. We instead went to Reflections, their &#8220;Executive Club&#8221;, inside. At least we were dressed the part.<br />
Four hours later, we were in the Receiving Line, greeting Janine and Dory&#8217;s family. The reception was at the Innisfail Legion hall. Although mostly a utilitarian building, it was amazing what a few lights and simple decorations could do to make it look very nice. After a little while, it was easy to forget where you were. Dinner was reasonably simple: Steak and potatoes. Pretty much what you&#8217;d expect for a cattle rancher&#8217;s wedding. (But it was a far cry from the proposed &#8220;Meat Salad&#8221; Simon had drooled over during our stay at the Red Deer Lodge.)<br />
The cattle jokes ran most of the night, mostly from Janine and Dory&#8217;s so-called family and friends, who took extreme pleasure in telling some very embarrassing (albeit funny) stories. I was sorry to say I had nothing to say &#8230; well, nothing except for one story about Dory&#8217;s truck, but I wasn&#8217;t keen on telling it because I couldn&#8217;t remember some of the specifics.<br />
Soon it was time for the first dance, to Elvis&#8217; &#8220;(I Can&#8217;t Help) Falling In Love With You&#8221;. A very good choice, in my humble opinion. The songs then slowly progressed from the traditional to the modern, including the dreaded &#8220;Macarena&#8221; (which Chris actually danced to &#8230; something to which I have to give a huge amount of credit, I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;d do that under threat of death). The &#8220;Chicken Dance&#8221;, fortunately, did not rear its ugly head.<br />
I, regrettably, had to make Chris leave just after midnight. The joys of my life often boil down to scheduling things, and in trying to make as many people happy as possible, had scheduled a river rafting trip for the following day. (Originally it had been tentatively scheduled for the day of the wedding, until I realized that I&#8217;d made a boo-boo.)<br />
My alarm went off at 7:30. Five hours of sleep just wasn&#8217;t enough. Nearly 12 hours of socializing, though not physically exhausting, still takes quite a wallop on your energy level. (I can only imaging how Janine and Dory must&#8217;ve felt the following day.) Still, being the ringleader for the day&#8217;s events meant I had to get on the ball very quickly.<br />
Unfortunately, it meant I forgot a towel and a change of clothes, as I was in too much of a rush to get out the door.<br />
Picking up Aysim and Jordon along the way, we pulled into Critical Mass&#8217; parking lot at 8:30, a few minutes later than I would have liked. But we were still waiting for others, so it wasn&#8217;t too bad. Cory, Angie, Mike, and Colin were already there. Carl was running late, and Shawn would be picked up along the way. Clay was nowhere in sight, and I was beginning to worry about all of us showing up on time.<br />
It was time for another trip down the Kicking Horse river (see [[A Whitewater Rafting Adventure on the Kicking Horse River]]). Fifty-one weeks ago, myself and five others braved the cold, churning waters to experience the thrill of ice-cold rapids. Two of us experienced it the hard way, by being thrown into the river (Sean catching the worst of it). So of course, we had to go again. (Although Sean is no longer with Critical Mass, he organized his own trip, which went the day before.)<br />
Cory, Angie, and Carl took off almost as soon as Carl had arrived. We waited around until Clay arrived (about 10 minutes later), at which time Colin, Mike, Jordon, and I left. Clay and Aysim still had to pick up Clay&#8217;s friend, but would meet us at Kootenay River Runners.<br />
All of us were off like a shot. We didn&#8217;t clear Calgary city limits until 9:00, so once again I played that dangerous game of chicken with the police and their radar guns. It never fails &#8212; you plan everything so that you don&#8217;t have to rush, and you always end up exceeding the speed limit by almost 50%. With luck, none of the flying meter maids were out &#8212; the last thing I need to is to get a ticket for the speeds we were hauling through the mountains.<br />
The drive out wasn&#8217;t too bad &#8212; unlike last year, it wasn&#8217;t raining. However, it was a quiet ride as my passengers all fell asleep. Next time, someone else can drive and *I&#8217;ll* sleep the whole way there.<br />
Cory had beat us by about 15 minutes. Clay was about that behind us, as were two more cars of Critical Mass people. They had come out the day before and camped (or taken a hotel room) for the night. There were 17 of us in total (others were Karen, Mark, and two of their friends, and Jaymie and her boyfriend Beau), and all raring to wet.<br />
Well, okay, maybe not all. Only three of us had gone rafting before (Cory, Jordon, and myself, and it had been a decade since Jordon last went), so the majority of us were newbies. Most were excited, Shawn a little much so, but no-one was ready to run screaming.<br />
Yet.<br />
After a small lunch, we got the equipment speech. Basically covers the basics of what we would wear. Not much had changed since the year before, only that we now had gloves and neoprene &#8220;socks&#8221; to help keep our feet warm. (They worked, too &#8212; my feet were much warmer this year.) We collected our gear, changed, and huddled down to the river for Orientation Part II. This is the safety speech, and the one that was beginning to freak Angie out a little. As the safety speech often includes worst-case scenarios, the uninitiated can get a little spooked.<br />
The river didn&#8217;t look too much different, though the water level was a little lower this year. (The temperature had been a bit colder in recent days, and the water hadn&#8217;t flowed as freely as a result.) Our guide, Mike, told us that the more impressive parts of the run, namely an 18-foot tall standing wave known as &#8220;Tablesaw&#8221;) wouldn&#8217;t be out, as the water level was too low. However, he said he&#8217;d still make it worth our while.<br />
Mike: &#8220;Okay, how do you want this? Easy, or [expletive deleted] hardcode?&#8221;<br />
Us: (Shouting loudly) &#8220;[EXPLETIVE DELETED] HARDCORE!&#8221;<br />
That pretty much set the tone for our trip. (That, and Mike (the guide) telling a lot of really bad jokes.) Poor Angie must&#8217;ve been terrified out of her mind after all our yelling and screaming. Something to do with testosterone, I guess. Either way, she would periodically emit a sound not unlike &#8220;What am I doing here?&#8221; as we continued down the &#8220;easy&#8221; part of the river. But it wasn&#8217;t long before the choppiness began to appear, and we started getting a little wet. After our first plunge through a Class 2 rapid, I could hear Angie saying: &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t so bad!&#8221;<br />
Soon we were going right through the middle of the hard stuff. Mike (our guide) was doing an excellent job of steering us right into the nasty stuff. Big water, large drops, holes behind rocks, and all of it as fast as we could paddle. Most of the other boats thought we were insane. (Aside from the fact that we were.) Most described us as &#8220;loud&#8221;.<br />
About halfway down, we reached the infamous &#8220;Portage&#8221;, a kilometre or so stretch of Class 3 and 4 rapids. This is usually the home of Tablesaw (when the water level is high), and the permanent home of Shotgun, the rapid that had wiped out our boat last year, dumping Sean and I in the drink. Angie, though a little nervous, wasn&#8217;t trying to get out of the boat. She wasn&#8217;t nearly as frightened as when we started.<br />
Soon, the boats had pulled out, and all six rafts took Portage head-on, with us going full tilt. Although I saw more of Portage this year than last (I was sitting one person back, so I could actually see this time), it was still a blur. Our guide handled it much better than the one we had the year before, quite often calling out &#8220;hang on&#8221; and &#8220;get down&#8221; as we piled right into (and over) rapids and rocks. When we finally hit Shotgun, we were running on pure adrenaline. Our war whoop echoed through the Kicking Horse valley.<br />
Shawn was nearly bursting through his skin, as was Carl. (Carl, up until that point, was the most laid back person I&#8217;ve ever met. Once caught up in the whole experience, he gave Shawn a run for his money as the loudest.) Angie now bore a devilish grin. She liked it. Too much. Mike (not the guide) and Colin were both pumped. Mike (the guide) was loving each second. We weren&#8217;t your &#8220;average&#8221; rafters &#8212; we wanted it hard, which meant he could do the kinds of things he would normally do only for himself&#8230;<br />
Like get caught in a hole. This is when the river has go around a large rock. It creates a region of low pressure, which draws in things, like our raft. It sounds dangerous, but it&#8217;s not. All it does is swamp the boat a bit, but as it&#8217;s self-draining anyway, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. We swamped the boat five or six times, each time paddling madly to get as close to the rock so we could flood the boat.<br />
Yeah, we were insane.<br />
About an hour later, we exited the last of the rapids for the upper portion of the river. This was when Mike (our guide) offered us a dip in the river, if we wanted. He didn&#8217;t even get a chance to finish the sentence before we&#8217;d all bailed into the river. At first, it wasn&#8217;t too bad. The face was a bit chilly, but all in all, I didn&#8217;t HOLY CRAP THIS WATER IS FREEZING GET ME THE HECK OUTTA HERE!!!<br />
I lunged for the perimeter line to start hauling myself back in. Shawn, who had hit the water only seconds before me, was now struggling to get back, realizing himself that the water was rather cold. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to haul yourself into one of these rafts &#8212; they sit high, and the now water-logged wetsuits and pullovers make you a little heavier than you might be without them. This is when I started to get a little worried.<br />
Because the boat was empty.<br />
Apparently, we&#8217;d all bailed into the river. I immediately began to wonder if we&#8217;d have to stay like this right until the end, which although not far away, felt like eternity in that water. But then I saw Mike (the guide) reach over, grab my life jacket, and haul me in. It took me a moment to get back up, but then I reached down and grabbed Carl, and hauled him in. I landed in the bottom of the raft, Carl on top of me. Then Mike (the guide) ceremoniously dumped Shawn on top of us. Then Cory and Colin came flying in, all of us a tangle of bodies.<br />
We tried to convince the staff to let us do the Lower Kicking Horse that afternoon. Unfortunately, they didn&#8217;t have enough room on the bus to let us go, as much as we wanted to. We&#8217;ll just have to wait until next time for that, I guess.<br />
We peeled off our second skins back at the Whitewater Ranch, and changed into dry clothes. Bidding our guides farewell, we broke a few more speed limits getting to St. James&#8217; Gate, a pub in Banff. It was time for the post-rafting beer and grub. We were all famished. It was obvious then that this was something we&#8217;d certainly do again. I just have to figure out when&#8217;s a good time to go, find all the people, and make sure we do the Upper and Lower portions. We&#8217;re not doing it halfway again&#8230;<br />
But I&#8217;m not driving.</p>

		<p>Although it&#8217;s been a very long time since I was a scout, I still try to do good deeds. Last night, nine dedicated CMassers did a good deed.<br />
Owing to employee pressure, Critical Mass started doing charity work some months ago. So far, it&#8217;s entailed a head-shaving fundraiser, an auction, and a couple of food drives (I think &#8212; some of the beginning of this year is a bit blurry). We&#8217;re getting into Habitat for Humanity, though we haven&#8217;t done anything with it yet.<br />
One thing we have done a few times, and this is a regular activity for us, is to make dinner one night at month at the Mustard Seed Street Ministry kitchen, for Calgary&#8217;s financially inhibited. We donate the majority of the food for that meal, and the labour to create it. Last night was my first crack at the kitchen.<br />
We headed over at 4:00 to the &#8220;Seed&#8221; (as it&#8217;s referred to by its staff) to start preparation. We had to chop and cook everything we had with us. Mercy, the Bistro manager and our head chef, headed over early to get started. Within a few minutes of arriving, we were mercilessly chopping celery, broccoli, bok choy (I was &#8220;Bok Choy Boy&#8221;), onions (luckily, they had a machine which did most of the work, but we had to peel and quarter them first), and carrots (I was on peeling detail).<br />
Early into the cutting process, I started to notice a strong stinging sensation in my right hand. I noticed, much to my chagrin, that the knife I was using was literally scraping skin off my forefinger. Most knives are thin metal plates with either plastic or wood wrapped around (or tacked to the side of) the handle. This knife had a serious user interface problem &#8212; the wood was too short, and left an 1/8 inch strip jutting out the top. Although not as sharp as the blade (which was pretty darn sharp, let me tell you), it was enough to peel off some skin. I donned a surgical glove for the remainder of the evening.<br />
Part way through the chopping, I was asked to help out with another task. While four of us cut veggies, three others were chopping fruit. We were making fruit salad for dessert. A lot of fruit salad. About 50 pounds of it, as near as I can tell. It had to be mixed in a very large pot, and I somehow landed the task of stirring the mass of fruit.<br />
With my arm.<br />
I was up to my elbow in melon and strawberries. It was a peculiar sensation, to say the least. It would have probably been a lot more pleasant if the fruit were warmer, but it was still chilled from refrigeration. My fingers were numb after a few minutes. That said, it felt like I was doing a remake of the kitchen scene from &#8220;9 1/2 Weeks&#8221;.<br />
We were making a stupidly large amount of food. The Seed is well-equipped for such a meal, though, complete with a huge array of pots of varying sizes (ranging from gigantic to titanic), scoops that can take about over a litre of contents at once, massive ovens that cooked eight huge pans of rice, an immense grill we used for stir frying the veggies, and a &#8230; uh &#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what to call it &#8230; a square caldron we used for cooking the sweet and sour chicken.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t have a complete recipe, here&#8217;s the one we used to make the sweet and sour chicken:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>80 lb</td>
<td>Cubed, cooked meat (chicken)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15 lb</td>
<td>Onions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>Garlic cloves, crushed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4&#215;100 oz</td>
<td>Pineapple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 L</td>
<td>Soy sauce</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Brown sugar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Vinegar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20 L</td>
<td>Water</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It all fit into that one cauldron.<br />
Add to that 50 lbs of fruit salad, three very large pots (each about 50 lbs) of vegetables, and at least 40 lbs of rice &#8230; that&#8217;s a lot of food. Aside from the vegetables, it was mostly cooked by 6:30, at which time the staff (including volunteers and ourselves) got to eat. Despite the mass quantities of food, it was still quite tasty. And the rice turned out much better than I thought was possible in an oven (better than any rice I&#8217;ve ever made).<br />
Then the rush started. Heather, Steve, Bill, Therese, and Eryn took the frontline for serving, Carla helped dispense coffee and tea, Mercy cooked the vegetables, and Jen and I did the grunt labour of keeping the serving trays full and the vegetables flowing to the grill to be cooked.<br />
The four and a half hours disappeared, and soon it was 8:30, which is when the kitchen closes. There wasn&#8217;t much left &#8212; a little for lunch, but that was about it. At that point, we were free to leave. All we had to do was cut, cook, and serve. Other staff were responsible for cleaning up after our mess. (And we made a pretty decent one, although it was hard to tell by the end &#8212; the Seed staff are very quick at cleaning up.)<br />
As we began to shut up the kitchen, signifying the end of dinner, one of the Seed&#8217;s patrons stuck his head in through one of the serving windows, to say thanks for dinner. He said something like this:<br />
&#8220;Y&#8217;know the movie &#8216;Angels in the Outfield&#8217;? Well, we got Angels in the kitchen!&#8221;<br />
We had served about 500 people, although we have yet to receive an exact number. We were feeling really good about ourselves. Until we went outside, that is.<br />
There were about a hundred people who hadn&#8217;t been able to get in. A hundred people who wouldn&#8217;t get dinner. It was sobering to realize that for all those you do help, there are always more in need. It just emphasized that what we are doing is in no way trivial.<br />
It&#8217;s also in no way easy. I was sore. I was physically exhausted. And my feet were ready to declare themselves a separate and distinct society from the rest of my body. But it was very rewarding. I opted to skip a movie last night, and instead curled up in a chair at home to rest.<br />
I will help at the Seed again, that much is for certain. Just not until my feet stop pounding.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Note to self: Never let anyone hold a stag party for me.<br />
Stuart, Chris, and I were invited to a stag party for our friend Dory. (Dory is Janine&#8217;s fiancée; Janine is one of Therese&#8217;s best friends.) Chris opted out, as he had a tight deadline to contend with. (In retrospect, I wish I could have said the same thing.)<br />
The party was in Innisfail, an itty-bitty community just south of Red Deer. It&#8217;s not noted for much, except maybe a John Deere dealership. Following some rather precise directions, we soon found ourselves at Hugh&#8217;s, whom I assume to be Dory&#8217;s best man.<br />
At first, Stuart and I were out of place. We&#8217;re city folk. Everyone else &#8230; wasn&#8217;t. They were either ranchers or farmers. Stuart at least had the upper hand &#8212; he knew something about seed protectants (owing to his tenure with agricultural advertising at his company). By comparison, I knew that cows go &#8220;moo&#8221;.<br />
Luckily, we weren&#8217;t the only city folk for long, as Dave and Wayne soon showed up. It gave us some conversation outside of poisoning groundhogs. (And no, I&#8217;m not kidding.) We were fed hamburgers and potato salad, both of which were outstanding. Had Stuart and I not eaten before departing Calgary, we probably would have ate more.<br />
The evening was &#8230; well &#8230; I&#8217;ve been to more interesting stags. All one of them. Yep, this is only my second stag. (Most my friends who have been married had the smarts to either not hold a stag, or at least the sense not to invite me.) My first (and only other) stag was for my friend Jason when I still lived in Toronto. It pretty much involved an hour of laser tag, and about $40 of video games at Sega City. Frankly, that&#8217;s my idea of fun.<br />
But I certainly wasn&#8217;t about to complain. This was Dory&#8217;s night, not mine. Besides, I met a few people I hadn&#8217;t before. So all in all, it wasn&#8217;t such a bad night.<br />
At least until talk of &#8220;peelers&#8221; (strippers) became more serious. I kept hoping this wasn&#8217;t one of those things that would evolve into reality. There are things I want to do in life. Visiting a strip club isn&#8217;t one of them. (It&#8217;s in my &#8220;no desire to&#8221; list, actually.) Around 11pm, one of the guests finally got the gumption, grabbed Dory, declared we were all going to &#8220;The Park&#8221;, and headed towards the trucks.<br />
I personally do not see the fascination with strip clubs. I don&#8217;t find them even remotely interesting &#8230; more revolting, repulsive, and degrading than anything else. It&#8217;s one of those last few vestiges of patriarchal society that were supposed to have been washed away with the Suffrage Movement. Instead, they hold a certainly appeal with (most) men. (Chris would later state that even if he had come, he wouldn&#8217;t have gone into the club. Frankly, I don&#8217;t blame him.)<br />
Stuart and I tentatively discussed joining the rest, both of us testing each other to see if we wanted to go. (We hadn&#8217;t discussed this ahead of time.) Neither of us seemed all that interested. The plan was to drive to the highway, and quietly disappear. However, we didn&#8217;t even make it to the car before someone shouted: &#8220;Hey! You got room in your car?&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s kinda hard to hide an empty back seat.<br />
We found ourselves driving two of Dory&#8217;s friends into downtown Red Deer. Although I cannot remember their names, they reminded me of high school jocks (there&#8217;s something about naked women that seems to turn men into adolescents &#8230; most men, anyway). Both knew where The Park was. Somehow, that didn&#8217;t surprise me. Stuart and I agreed to make an appearance, and then duck out. Which was good, &#8216;cuz even from the outside, this place didn&#8217;t look all that great. I shuddered at the thought of what lay beyond the door.<br />
We were told that once upon a time, The Park was actually a &#8220;nice&#8221; place. That was hard to believe by looking around. It looked like someone had set off a bad 70s linoleum bomb. Other horrors of the attack included tacky lights, bad music, really bad furniture, and staff and patrons that were &#8230; frightening. As one of my co-workers so eloquently put it, it was a place so seedy, you needed a tetanus shot. The only thing missing was the biker gang&#8230;<br />
&#8230;who showed up later.<br />
We caught the tail end of an act that had a few of us wanting to run screaming. However, we were obligated to at least wish Dory well before leaving. We stuck around just long enough for me to have something to drink (in the drive from Hugh&#8217;s I had become enormously thirsty) and Stuart to play a very quick game of foosball. But it was just long enough for trouble to start. The rest of the group was looking to get Dory into the &#8220;traditional&#8221; embarrassing situation.<br />
This is usually done in two stages: 1) Get the person extremely drunk (this has two advantages: less resistance, and the unlucky victim can claim plausible denial in the event they get in trouble with their significant other), and 2) Put them where they wouldn&#8217;t normally be caught dead. In Dory&#8217;s case, it was six shots of something nasty (never did find out what), and tipping the manager to get Dory on stage. (He was taped to the chair so he couldn&#8217;t move. I&#8217;m not sure of this was so he couldn&#8217;t touch the dancer &#8212; Quebec has that rule &#8212; or just so he couldn&#8217;t run away.)<br />
We stuck around to watch poor Dory be subjected to something just shy of pure evil (aren&#8217;t we such good friends?). At first, we assumed that Dory was looking away due to discomfort (for the record, there was no nudity while Dory was on stage). But after a couple minutes, a few of us began to suspect that he wasn&#8217;t uncomfortable &#8212; he was rapidly heading towards unconsciousness. Part way through the second song, to the apparent dismay of the dancer, Dory passed out.<br />
It was simultaneously the funniest and saddest thing I think I&#8217;ve ever witnessed. As if I didn&#8217;t already have issues with marriage (for myself), witnessing Dory&#8217;s pseudo-theatrical fate was enough to convince me that marriage is something I just don&#8217;t want to deal with &#8212; stag parties are just plain cruel.<br />
Dory wasn&#8217;t in the best of shape after that. The six shots of whatever had taken their toll. Stuart and I stuck around to see if Dory was okay (after he made quick trip to the Men&#8217;s Room). The party packed up about then, with most disappearing to another strip club in town, Dave and Wayne taking Dory back to Hugh&#8217;s place to recover, and Stuart and I returning to Calgary.<br />
I can safely say that I&#8217;ve been there and done that. Whatever infinitesimally small interest I might have had was thoroughly squashed in less than 30 minutes. With luck, I won&#8217;t have to do that again.<br />
Ever.</p>

		<p>A little over two months ago, Dave &#8220;36&#8221; Chambers left Calgary for Toronto, where we were opening another office. On Friday, he came back to visit, and it was up to us to remind him why it was (or wasn&#8217;t) a bad idea to leave.<br />
This was a weekend for travelling &#8212; many CMassers were moving about the country. Some were coming to Calgary, some were going to Toronto, but most (of the travellers) were going to Vancouver for a wedding. Shawn was Toronto-bound, conveniently about 45 minutes after Dave&#8217;s plane was to land. Making my trip completely useful, I took Shawn to the airport, he tagged off with Dave, and I took Dave back to our place.<br />
For a game night of near-epic proportions.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A lot of people give Calgary a hard time. They call it &#8220;Cowtown&#8221;. They think that we&#8217;re overrun with cowboys and horses. They think everyone has a shotgun rack in their beat-up pickup truck. They think that most of people who live here are intolerant hicks with nothing better to do than pick fights every night. They think it&#8217;s really cold year-round. They think there&#8217;s no culture.<br />
The problem is that people don&#8217;t think. They accept without question.<br />
These were stories I&#8217;d heard before moving here, so I too was guilty of not asking questions. I didn&#8217;t know much about Calgary before I first came here in September 1997. My first exposure to Calgary was an eye-opening one &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t expected such a young city. Both Gerry and I recognized that almost immediately, and how much we suddenly felt the urge to move here.<br />
As it stands, I moved to Vancouver and Gerry moved to Bermuda. But now I&#8217;m here, and in the last year I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit about this city. It&#8217;s time to dispell a few myths.<br />
Myth #1: Calgary is full of cowboys.<br />
There are two times this is actually true. First, during the Calgary Stampede. This is when the only way you can tell the city folk from cow pokes is by how clean and pressed the clothes are. The only other time this is true is when some of them gets lost, and somehow finds their way downtown. It&#8217;s rare, but it&#8217;s been known to happen from time to time. (For all we know, it could just be part of an ad campaign.)<br />
Oh, and then there&#8217;s patrons of Cowboys, Desperados, and Outlaws, three of the western-themed bars in town. But those are usually drunk jocks.<br />
Myth #2: Most people who live here are intolerant hicks.<br />
Most of the people who live in this city moved from other provinces (of all the people I&#8217;ve met here, only about 10 are native Calgarians). Many are from back east. We have the youngest demographic of any city in Canada &#8212; the average age is 33.7 (as of 1996, down from 34.5 in 1991), while the Canadian average was 35.8. Also, over 50% of our residents have a post-secondary education of some form.<br />
We also have a lot of rich people. It&#8217;s that black, oily stuff they keep finding out here. There are a large number of people who&#8217;ve made small (and large) fortunes off it. Of course, you can&#8217;t spot some of these people &#8212; they look completely ordinary. That is, until they climb into their Mercedes, BMWs, Porches (although they&#8217;re not as popular out here), high-end SUVs, and expensive Japanese imports.<br />
If there are hicks here, they&#8217;re keeping a mighty low profile.<br />
Myth #3: It&#8217;s cold year-round.<br />
No, it&#8217;s *dry* here year-round. Our altitude, combined with a lack of suitably large body of water (the Bow River certainly does not count) keeps us gulping liquids and using moisturizers more than most people. But there is an upside to all that &#8212; the driness cuts down on the cold. Without moisture to cut through our clothes, a heavy shirt, fleece, and windbreaker can get you though weather that freezes people to death back in southern Ontario.<br />
The downside, of course, is that when we go to more humid climates without suitable protection, we freeze even in what others consider comfortable weather.<br />
Sure we do have winter from as early as late October through to as late as early June (worst-case scenario), but we also get Chinooks all year (yes, we get Chinooks in the summer, too, but they&#8217;re not as pronounced as in the winter), so even in the dead of winter, when others are digging themselves out of 10 feet of snow, we could be wearing shorts on the skihills.<br />
Myth #4: There&#8217;s no culture; there&#8217;s nothing to do.<br />
This is the single largest myth, and it&#8217;s one that many transplanted Calgarians continue. Calgary isn&#8217;t like Vancouver, or Toronto, or Montreal. In those cities, you can&#8217;t avoid things to do &#8212; they&#8217;re in your face 24-7. But out here, people aren&#8217;t interested in that kind of constant bombardment. We have a large theatre scene &#8212; we have a complex here that I haven&#8217;t seen in either Toronto or Vancouver. We have a large concert hall, and several stadiums perfectly capable of holding concerts or sports, depending on your fancy.<br />
And then, of course, there&#8217;s the outdoors. I would love to know what the population of the city drops to during the summer, when almost everyone ducks out for the wilderness. You can&#8217;t get a camping spot in this province on any long weekend &#8230; not without either booking months (and I mean *months*) in advance, or staking out a spot (in the non-reservable grounds) days ahead.<br />
Okay, still not impressed? I left this one for last, because even I have trouble believing it. Calgary has a skatepark, called the Shaw Millennium Skatepark. This is a concrete playground built specifically for the skateboarding population of our city &#8212; a place where they can go and grind to their heart&#8217;s content, without any fear that some security guard will interrupt their fun.<br />
This park was built by the city (with funds from local companies, such as Shaw Cable), is open 24 hours a day, and completely free. Chris, Stuart, and I went over to it on Saturday night to get a close look and see what it was all about. It&#8217;s quite large, and well-built (at least from a skateboarder&#8217;s perspective). It allows kids to do whatever they want, and hang out with people like themselves. And even at midnight, there are kids of all ages practicing, showing off, and hanging out.<br />
It&#8217;s just west of the downtown core, wedged between 6th and 9th Avenues, far enough away from condos to not bother residents, but close enough so the kids can still get there. I can&#8217;t think of another city that has something similar in its downtown. Stuart was quick to point out that Toronto would find some way to turn it into a golf course. Vancouver would build a condo, and then charge $150,000 for a 400 square foot bachelor.<br />
I hope that in some small way, I might have changed your view of Calgary. Although different from other large cities in Canada, it&#8217;s no less a fine place to live. I offer anyone the chance to come here and see for yourself.</p>

		<p>It was once said that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fear is the oppressor of souls and nations. It is the beginnings of hatred and suffering. And it&#8217;s what has kept me away from Vancouver. Fear of my past. Fear of opening old wounds.<br />
This is why on Friday past, one year, two months, and four days since I left Vancouver, that I felt it was time to face those fears.<br />
Well, actually, it was a month earlier that I made the decision, but you get my point&#8230;<br />
It basically stemmed from one email I received from my friend Greg, suggesting I come out to see a baseball game in Seattle with some of my former co-workers (and current friends) from Radical. It was part spur-of-the-moment, part &#8220;I really need to get out of this office for a couple days!&#8221;, but when it really came down to it, it was time for me to go back.<br />
I&#8217;d had the opportunity a couple times before, the most recent previous one being an invitation to Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;Glug&#8221; party, a tradition she and Guy have at Christmas. However, I&#8217;d never really felt ready. I had always said I was busy (which was true), but primarily, I knew that mentally and emotionally, I hadn&#8217;t forced off my demons &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t ready to go back.<br />
Rising early on Friday, I made my way to the airport to catch my 7:50am flight to Vancouver. I took public transit, partly for the heck of it, and partly so I&#8217;d get a better idea of times for the next time I do this. Not having the best information available on times and schedules, I ended up with about 20 minutes to wait for the bus once I&#8217;d reached the end of the C-Train line.<br />
I watched the sun rise above the houses, casting long shadows across the bus terminal, and shedding light on a dawn of reawakening. (It&#8217;s amazing the stuff you can dish out when you&#8217;re being philosophical, eh?) It was my first real thoughts about what I was about to do. Would I run into my past, and would she confront me? Would I see any of her friends? And more importantly, what would I do? These were questions I was unable to answer, even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about that very thing for over a year.<br />
Soon I found myself at the airport, awaiting the boarding for the flight. Unlike my previous flights with Air Canada (see [[Christmas in Oakville, New Years Eve in Calgary]]), this flight left right on time. The flight was uneventful &#8212; up, breakfast, read, down. All told, about an hour and 10 minutes.<br />
Descending into Vancouver was &#8230; weird. I recognized everything. Surrey, Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, the Port Mann Bridge, Metrotown, the Richmond Auto Mall, IKEA. It almost felt like I&#8217;d never left, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling. Something between excitement and knowing you&#8217;re being watched.<br />
BC Transit being on strike, I had to take a taxi to get out of the airport. (Although Greg had offered to pick me up, I had told him not to waste his time &#8212; I knew he already had a killer schedule, and going to the airport is quite a bit out of his way.) The trip was quite, pleasant, and a brisk drive down memory lane. In less than 20 minutes, I was standing on the corner of 10th and Granville, wondering what I was going to do next.<br />
The first thing I did was call Lee, who had been Radical&#8217;s Director of QA and the coach of the Rad Sox. Being already at work, we agreed to meet that night, as planned, at Soho&#8217;s in Yaletown. I so proceeded to step #2 &#8212; wait. I wanted to hold off until about 9:30 before calling Katrina (another friend and former co-worker), but I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her too early in the morning. (More on this in a few paragraphs.)<br />
So it was off to one of a thousand local Starbuck&#8217;s to indulge in my second hot chocolate of the morning (the first being at the Blenz in Calgary airport). I sat, sipping my venti, and really thought about where I was. I actually sat with my back to the door, a little worried about who might walk through it.<br />
Irrational fears are the worst kind.<br />
After pondering the state of affairs for about a half hour (ventis are pretty big), I retreated to the moist Vancouver air, and proceeded to contact Katrina. I had hoped to meet up with her that morning, as I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I was going to do that day. I had originally hoped to meet up with Lee for coffee, and then visit with Katrina later that morning. However, things don&#8217;t always go according to plan &#8212; Katrina was busy getting all the things she and her husband needed to pack everything in their home so they could move to San Francisco.<br />
I sat next to Katrina for two years. She&#8217;s one of the people I miss most about Vancouver, along with several of my co-workers. They were what made my life there happier than it would have been. But now Katrina was also an ex-Radicalite, and moving on with her life by accepting a position at Pixar. Yes, the same people who brought you the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies and &#8220;A Bug&#8217;s Life&#8221;. Not only am I impressed, but I can actually say I know someone at Pixar. This was too cool.<br />
Resigning myself to having a morning on my own, I proceeded to run errands. First was a quick stop to the bank to deposit a rebate cheque (I had to deposit it in person, and getting to the bank during the day ain&#8217;t easy). I then stopped quickly at Bernard Callebaut to pick up some chocolates as a kind of &#8220;bon voyage&#8221; present for Katrina and Guy.<br />
Then I wandered. I wander well, particularly when I have nothing else to do, and I know (more or less) where I&#8217;m going.<br />
I headed towards downtown along Granville. I decided I wanted to go to Burrard Inlet and look around. It wasn&#8217;t a great day &#8212; the sky was overcast and I was being spit on periodically from above &#8212; but it was good day for looking around. But being in a wandering mood, I made a side trip through Granville Island, one of my favourite places in the city.<br />
On my way in, I stopped to donate some spare change to Jack &#8220;The Bear&#8221;, a self-employed social worker who strives to make his &#8220;group&#8221; (whomever they are) better off. I&#8217;d seen and heard of this guy before, and not being in a rush, I allowed myself (somewhat unwittingly) to end up in a half-hour pseudo-speech. He&#8217;s an articulate man, and he certainly has some interesting ideas. I tried to offer a few suggestions (his ideas, though good, need the odd improvement), but getting a word in edgewise is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s easier sliding papers between the blocks of the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<br />
I wandered about the Island a bit, and went into the market. They say that smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. The second I walked in the door, it felt like someone was force feeding me 1,000 TV channels at once as snippets of two years suddenly raced through my mind. Some good, some bad &#8230; but after a moment, all I could smell was the produce, and food is always good. It took a lot of will power to get out of the market without buying anything.<br />
I exited the Island via the Aquabus, which ferried me to the other side of False Creek. This was far better than walking all the way back to the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, and then walking all the way back downtown again. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed how much I missed the smell of the sea, not until I got near the water. The smell is unmistakable, and wonderful. I think I was a fish in a previous life&#8230;<br />
The wandering continued as I worked my way down Granville. Not much had changed &#8212; same stores, same buildings, even some of the same people. The city line had a few new condos, and there was the odd old building reduced to a parking lot, but otherwise it was the same. Tagging (a form of graffiti) was very prevalent, especially at the Paradise and Caprice theatres (both now closed). Not unsurprising, I hate to say. The Eaton&#8217;s was open again. A new pub sat kiddie-corner, which had been abandoned or under construction during the entire time I was in Vancouver. A new London Drugs is open at the corner of Granville and Georgia. It used to be book store, which went under when Chapters moved into town. The London Drugs had moved from its old store further down the road, now open to anyone silly enough to lease the space.<br />
Canada Place was seeing some new construction. I had vaguely remembered a plan to expand the pier to increase convention space. The plan, it seemed, was thoroughly under way. As such, my favourite vantage point to view Burrard Inlet was unavailable. Instead, I took up a viewpoint on the promenade between Waterfront Station and the Province&#8217;s building.<br />
Although the view was essentially the same as the last time I&#8217;d viewed it, something seemed different. Not as much life &#8212; it seemed almost a little dead. I don&#8217;t know if it was a changed perspective due to my departure a year earlier, or if it was the weather. It almost looked like someone had dropped out some of the colour from the image I was seeing.<br />
I was still a little afraid, I think.<br />
Through Waterfront Station, and onto Water Street, I walked through Gastown. Not much had changed there, either. A couple stores had moved, a couple closed, and one lot (or building, I&#8217;m not sure which) had been opened up. I think there had been a restaurant there once, but I can&#8217;t really remember. The same burned out husk of a building sat across the street from the Olde Spaghetti Factory, though the structure supports had been beefed up a lot. I shook my head, wondering what on earth was going on there.<br />
I turned up Carrall Street, and headed back towards False Creek, Science World glinting in the distance. In moments, I realized that I&#8217;d made a bit of a blunder. This is what I get for pondering and not paying attention. I found myself at the corner of Carrall and W. Hastings. It&#8217;s known as Pigeon Park, and has the highest murder rate of any location in Canada. It&#8217;s not pleasant during the day &#8230; but you don&#8217;t go near it at night. I briskly walked through and on across the road. I didn&#8217;t feel safer until a couple of blocks later.<br />
I stalled a bit longer (I wasn&#8217;t due at Radical until almost 1pm) and made a side trip through the International Village, a large mall, still mostly empty over a year and a half since it opened. It looks really nice, but I wonder how much money they must lose from the lack of tenants.<br />
Up Abbott, I arrived at Pacific. This took me over towards Quebec Street, and onto Terminal Avenue. I was in the home stretch. Aside from Greg, I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone from Radical in over a year. Fear was rapidly being overcome by nervous combination of excitement and panic.<br />
My first run-in was with Fernando and one of the Foundation developers, whose name I couldn&#8217;t remember, even though he started at Radical the same day I did (my panic began to rise as I realized I couldn&#8217;t remember names). A few moments later, I entered the foyer of Radical&#8217;s new home, and headed right to the top floor.<br />
The receptionist I didn&#8217;t recognize. Lisa was gone, so I find out, having quit back in the summer. Greg could not be found, nor could Joel. Luckily, we could find Neall. As I waited for him to arrive, I heard my name being called by Allison. She had also started the same day as me, but unlike myself, was quite comfortable at her job. She looked good as ever, and still bore the same wonderful smile she always seemed to have.<br />
Neall hadn&#8217;t changed much, either &#8212; though I was just as happy to see him again. The reunions started to come quickly as Dave appeared through the main door, and Fred from the back office. Names were flitting around in my head so fast, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I nearly forgot Fred&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Neall offered to take me on a quick tour, and show me what Radical had moved in to. Having used up all their old space, Radical had taken a lease in a near-brand new building, and had the interior made up to their specifications. It&#8217;s quite nice, really &#8230; especially the log cabin in the common room.<br />
Yes, a log cabin. It&#8217;s their home theatre. I&#8217;ve seen and heard of some pretty wacky things in companies, but this is one of the wackiest. The common room at Radical is two stories tall, and easily big enough to fit a small house. It also has a 270+ degree view of Vancouver, including what must be a magnificent view of the North Shore.<br />
A new building, but it wasn&#8217;t much different than the old building &#8212; totally organic space, managers in the middle, work teams scattered around the outside. Greg had commented that Critical Mass&#8217; building looks more polished, but for the environment, I know a lot of people here would prefer Radical&#8217;s setup.<br />
Eric was still in a dungeon. This is where he likes to be &#8212; in the dark, away from everyone. I assume it lets him get on with his work. Martin was with him, discussing physics calculations. Mark was in the office he shared with Neall, looking none the worse for wear. Across from the office was Jean-Luc and Senta (whose name I sadly forgot, and I felt like such a heel for forgetting it), and a desk away was Nigel. He summed up my return rather succinctly: &#8220;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&#8221;<br />
Down the floor, I ran into Lisa (the office manager) and Cliff (one of the IT guys). I inadvertently interrupted their conversation, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much. Neall took me down a floor to show me around a bit more. There were a lot of familiar faces, but many of them without names. I was now feeling particularly bad about forgetting so many people. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I remembered Yayoi&#8217;s and Rod&#8217;s names, something I&#8217;m not horribly proud of. Jesse seemed a bit surprised to see me, but then I don&#8217;t think he knew I was coming out.<br />
Returning to the seventh floor, I finally found Greg. He immediately started to apologize for not being around. Greg was up to his neck in E3 preparations. The game he&#8217;s working on has to be down there for exhibition, and there were still a lot of issues to clear up. Although it had been planned a month in advance, I hadn&#8217;t picked the best weekend to come out.<br />
Just before lunch, I finally ran into Tim, my old boss. He&#8217;s now one of the VPs (Neall is now the head of Pure3D), although I don&#8217;t know of what specifically. He had always been a fairly serious person while I was there, but he seemed somehow happier. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the haircut, but he looked better off.<br />
Members of Pure3D (Neall, Mark, Nigel) and Pure3D alumni (Kevin, Greg, Gabe, and myself) all went out for lunch, to a place called The Whip. (Gabe picked us up; like me, Gabe is also an ex-Radicalite.) It seemed somehow wrong that we weren&#8217;t eating anything Asian. Pure3D ritual had been typically Chinese. This was definitely not Chinese &#8230; although it was very tasty. The conversation, though, was definitely Pure3D.<br />
The more things change&#8230;<br />
After lunch, I finally met up with Joel. He&#8217;d been a bit of a harder character to find, being the lead programmer for one of Radical&#8217;s projects (meetings being the bane of his existence). He looked tired, like everyone else on the team. Being sick probably didn&#8217;t help much, either. We talked for a while, but I chose to keep the conversation fairly short, as he was busy dealing with the crises of getting a game ready for E3.<br />
I took the opportunity to leave Radical and go visit with Katrina and Guy. By now, it was raining outside, so I was quite happy to find the Aquabus still running between Science World and Stamp&#8217;s Landing, where Katrina and Guy live. They were home, and it only took a few moments (with a bit of direction) to get down to their slip.<br />
Oh, did I mention they live on a sailboat?<br />
This was why it was so difficult for them to get ready to move. Not only do they have to pack their belongings, they have to move their house as well. Logically, not an easy move. But they seemed fairly calm about it &#8212; most people get downright cranky when they move.<br />
I spent most of the afternoon with them, talking for a while, but them helping them pack. It was partly because I wanted to get the skinny on their move. It had come out of nowhere (at least from my perspective), and I was very curious to get their thoughts on it. They were excited. New place, new challenges, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Not wanting to get in their way of packing, I&#8217;d also offered to help them pack. Katrina and I spent the afternoon wrapping things in bubble wrap.<br />
I probably stayed longer than I really should have, but I felt compelled to not just drop in for a few minutes and then bolt. After all, I&#8217;d spent two years sitting next to Katrina, working with her, talking with her, and learning from her. Besides, until I go to San Francisco, I don&#8217;t know when (or even if) I&#8217;ll ever see her again.<br />
At 7:00, all three of us had to leave. Katrina and Guy were going to a friend&#8217;s place, and I was due to go to SoHo&#8217;s and meet up with Lee (and hopefully, people whose names I could remember). Despite being nearly 40 minutes late by the time I got there, I was the first to show. (Hopefully, we didn&#8217;t scare off any other potential revellers.) The second person to arrive was Ryan, a Radicalite whom I wasn&#8217;t sure was there to come out with us, or was meeting other friends. Luckily, he remembered me, and reintroduced himself. I was glad, because even when I was at Radical, I really didn&#8217;t know who he was&#8230;<br />
We talked at length until Lee arrived. You&#8217;d swear no time had passed since the last time I&#8217;d seen her. She didn&#8217;t look a day older, and was just as upfront as ever, just the way we love her. It didn&#8217;t take long for any awkwardness to pass. Soon, we were embroiled in animated conversation, along with one of Lee&#8217;s co-workers, who had also come out. Not too many Radicalites (ex or otherwise) came out that night, although I was very happy to see Lisa (the ex-receptionist) again. I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d gotten along with her very well, and had missed saying &#8220;hi&#8221; to her every morning.<br />
Somewhere in the evening, I stopped looking over my shoulder. I stopped looking in the shadows. I stopped being apprehensive. It was like I suddenly knew the story, like I&#8217;d already seen the movie and knew exactly when the creepy, half-dead monster leaps out. It was like the fear had dissipated like morning fog. Sure, the past will always be there, but spending the day in Vancouver, and with my friends, had shown me there was nothing to fear. It was only then that I truly felt relaxed.<br />
Neall appeared around 10:30, and joined our little group. Greg made a brief appearance, only to apologize for not coming out. The debate of where I would stay that night (begun earlier in the day) apparently had been solved &#8212; Neall would drop me off at Mark&#8217;s on our way home in preparation for the next day. This left Greg to quickly go to a friend&#8217;s birthday party, catch a few hours sleep, and get back to work early the next day. Sadly, because of the deadline, Greg wasn&#8217;t coming with us.<br />
Neall and I finally managed to leave SoHo&#8217;s around 12:30. I gave Lee a big hug (we&#8217;d had a good, deep conversation for most of the night, and I remembered all over again why I missed being around people like her), and stepped out into the cool night. Neall and I walked back to Radical, enjoying the walk, and talking about the state of Radical. It was refreshing to see how things had evolved since I&#8217;d left. It was very reassuring to see that management (including Neall, now that&#8217;s he&#8217;s part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;) still has a firm grip and good steer of the Good Ship Radical.<br />
Fires were raging when we got into the office. A Pure3D patch hadn&#8217;t taken well, and Neall had to help out Vlad (the technical director) to get the software working again. Also, we were giving Eric a lift, and he was still working out a few issues with a demo he was programming. (He&#8217;d been at it since late Wednesday, I believe &#8230; non-stop. He hadn&#8217;t gone home.) Due to these reasons, we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. This also meant I was now staying at Neall&#8217;s, because it was now too late to go to Mark&#8217;s.<br />
I crashed on Neall&#8217;s couch that night. I was exhausted. I&#8217;d been up for just about 23 hours straight since that morning, walked about 10 kilometres since that morning, ate almost nothing outside of a sandwich at lunch, and was ready to fall dead. I was asleep in seconds.<br />
The alarm came far too early for my liking. But we had to get rolling fast &#8212; we had a baseball game to go to. Although the game didn&#8217;t start until 1:05pm, we had to pick up Neall&#8217;s sister, drive to Mark&#8217;s, pick up Gabe, and then drive to Seattle. It&#8217;s not a long drive, but it still takes time. Although we moved as fast as possible, we were delayed by a mysterious case of nose bleed, which I have yet to explain. (It plagued me the entire weekend.)<br />
After a slight detour to pick up Angie (Neall&#8217;s sister), we arrived at Mark and Carol&#8217;s to switch to a different vehicle. Our trip to Seattle would be in style &#8212; a Warner Brothers edition Chevy Venture. Nothing like being able to play video games and watch movies during the trip. Then it was off through to the west end of Richmond to pick up Gabe. It was almost 10am by the time we were all on our way to the border.<br />
We arrived in Seattle around noon. Mark deftly whizzed us through the various onramps and city streets towards the Port of Seattle, where Safeco Field lies. (It&#8217;s adjacent to the site of the former Kingdome, now the site of the new football stadium.) You can&#8217;t miss Safeco Field &#8212; it&#8217;s big. And it&#8217;s colour is unique for the area it sits in. There I found that Carol wasn&#8217;t joining the game with us &#8212; she was going shopping while we enjoyed America&#8217;s pastime. Unfortunately, that also meant she took the van with her, which contained my jacket. (Upon hopping out, Gabe and I declared that it was warm enough to go without jackets &#8212; Angie and Mark were far wiser, and Neall had a heavy shirt.)<br />
Safeco Field, although new and (assumedly) state-of-the-art, was built in the tradition of the great baseball fields: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. It&#8217;s also a dedicated baseball stadium &#8212; no other sports (or events, as near as I can tell) occupy the space. The field is grass, and the stands are open to the wind &#8212; only the roof rolls shut to block out the rain (important on the West Coast).<br />
Our seats were at first base, about 20 rows up. Aside from the overhang of the upper deck which blocked the view of some of the flies, they were great seats. We were also one row away from the promenade, where we could find virtually any snack food imaginable, including the ubiquitous hot dogs, but also garlic fries, fish and chips, clam chowder, hamburgers, pizza &#8230; and all by local companies, no McDonald&#8217;s or Versa Foods here.<br />
This was Game 2 in a series between the Mariners and the Blue Jays. The last time I&#8217;d seen a Blue Jays game was about 10 years ago in Skydome, though it might have been 11 &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen so many, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Almost all of my Jays games had been courtesy of a family friend, Mr. Gairdner, who offered us his season tickets from time to time. I had forgotten in those years just how much fun professional baseball really is.<br />
Well, when you&#8217;re not freezing to death.<br />
I made one major mistake. I left my jacket in the car. I should have been smart and brought it with me. But no, I thought I was fine. Stupid me. I forgot that I was on the West Coast, where the humidity is much higher. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that until the temperature rises into the low 20s (Celsius, of course), it will always be cold for me in the more humid regions of the world. Living in Calgary has dried me out, and my immunity to the cold seems to have waned. I can hack -20 degree weather here quite easily. But minus six in Toronto was brutal at Christmas (I wasn&#8217;t even phased by -20 when I used to live in Ontario), and I was finding that even 13 degrees in Seattle was cold, especially with the wind. I chose to put up with the chilliness, rather than fork out the money for a Mariner&#8217;s jacket&#8230;<br />
The opening ceremonies were a different spin on what I remember from Toronto. Like the Hitmen games I&#8217;d seen last month, Major League Baseball now has games to entertain viewers &#8212; kids&#8217; home run derbies, and pitching contests. Personally, I think it cheapens the game, reducing the game to almost something of a sideshow.<br />
What impressed me was the singing of the national anthems. They brought in the Walla Walla High School Chamber Group. Although American, they sung perhaps the most amazing rendition of &#8220;O Canada&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever heard. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Mark was the only one of us who sang along &#8230; I usually don&#8217;t because my singing usually sends people running for dear life. The choir&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; was, sadly, typically American &#8212; seldom sung the way it was written. There are times I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m Canadian, where our national anthem is sung only two ways, English and French, and is always the same length.<br />
I&#8217;m not entire sure how many Canadians were there that day (we saw a few Canadian flags floating around), but there was a fair bit of cheering when Toronto took the field. Understandably, though, the cheering was much louder when Seattle came out &#8230; especially for their right fielder, Ichiro Suzuki. He&#8217;s one of two Japanese players with Seattle, and both are immensely popular, the other being closing pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki. They&#8217;re good players &#8212; Ichiro hits a mean ball, and Kazuhiro throws a pretty vicious pitch.<br />
The game was tight &#8212; a couple home runs, some really great fielding, good solid hits, and the odd error made for some really good drama. I remembered watching the World Series back in 1992 in the townhouse I shared with roommates Roger, Ed, and Brian, screaming at the mistakes and groaning every hit the Braves made during the sixth game of the World Series, only to later wake the dead (along with everyone else in the complex) as the Jays went onto victory.<br />
Different team, different city, different opponents, and not even a championship on the line &#8230; the emotions were all the same. We all huffed at missed chances, cheered for the really good plays, and whined when the Mariners scored. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a blow-out for either team &#8212; a good solid race clear through. The only way I would&#8217;ve enjoyed it more was if I&#8217;d been warmer.<br />
By the seventh inning, I was chilled to the bone. Neall noticed my sad plight, and literally gave me the shirt off his back. I knew the four of them were laughing me &#8212; admittedly, I was laughing at myself. Once upon a time, the cold didn&#8217;t bother me. I hate to admit it, but I&#8217;m a damp weather wimp now.<br />
The game ended on a down note &#8212; the Jays lost 7-5. After watching the roof close (which is a bit of spectacle in itself), we worked our way out and tried to meet up with Carol. The only problem was navigating through the 42,000 other fans who were doing roughly the same thing. Fortunately for us, Carol and I were both equipped with cell phones, so after a few conversations, we managed to all meet up.<br />
Departing the port, we headed into the downtown area, to Pioneer Square, and the Elliott Bay Book Store. This is perhaps the coolest book store I&#8217;ve ever been in. It&#8217;s huge &#8212; about the size of a chapters, only with more books. And it&#8217;s in (what I would assume to be) a heritage building. Being from Alberta, buying books in the States doesn&#8217;t really save me any money, so I just took the time to look around.<br />
Hunger soon had it&#8217;s call, though, and we were off in search of food. Unfortunately, no-one was particularly helpful in deciding where to go. We drove somewhat aimlessly around Seattle trying to find a place to eat, all the while asking &#8220;where are we going?&#8221;. We ultimately ended up at 13 Coins, a restaurant Mark had learned about in a travel guide.<br />
One day, I will finally obtain proof that the restaurants that appear in travel guides are only there because the restaurateurs bribed the author. Of all the so-called great places to eat that I&#8217;ve read about, only a couple were actually good. Unfortunately, 13 Coins wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
This place had decor that even Elvis would be terrified of. I was convinced that someone had loved the 70s so much, that they refused to redecorate with anything less awful. But when you take into account the &#8220;cheese factor&#8221; of such a place, it&#8217;s kind of interesting &#8230; for a novelty, that is.<br />
The quality of the food, so I&#8217;ve found, usually matches the decor. And believe me, it was pretty darn hard to find something on the menu that I wanted to eat. (Mind you, it was mostly because I was still full from the hot dog, chicken strips and fries, and the tepidly bland hot chocolate I&#8217;d had at Safeco Field.) I settled on a Philadelphia Steak Sandwich, which turned out to be a small piece of beef on garlic toast. Not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse.<br />
The trip back to Vancouver was marked with the showing of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. (Note to self: Make sure there is a video system in my next car.) Despite it being one of my favourite movies, I still fell asleep for about an hour or so. The movie ended just as we were pulling into Richmond, and dropped off Gabe. The next stop was at Radical, where I was going to meet up with Greg. I grabbed all my things (I&#8217;d brought my bag with me), and said goodbye. I called up to Greg, who came down to let me in. A quick thumbs-up sent Mark, Carol, Neall, and Angie off into the night.<br />
Greg, along with several of his team members, were hard at work on their game. It was going to be a late night, which Greg immediately started apologizing for. But frankly, I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out at Radical. I always liked hanging out there, even when I was the only one. It was a fun company, and near as I can tell, still is. Greg and I struck a happy medium &#8212; while he coded, I would test.<br />
So for the next four hours, I played a game that no-one will see for about four months. And no, I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it. I will say this &#8212; it&#8217;s a LOT of fun. Greg, like most of the programmers I worked with at Radical, are wizards &#8212; they can churn out some of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen or played. This game was no different. Although it won&#8217;t set any new standards for graphics, the game play is outstanding &#8230; definitely better than another game that will ultimately be compared so when it finally ships.<br />
The game doesn&#8217;t wrap up until early August. So why the crunch in early May? The Electronic Entertainment Exposition, known as E3, which is in mid-May. This is when all the Christmas games first appear. This is when game companies try to outdo each other. This is *the* event if you work in the video game industry. And this game is debuting there. Like any good video game project, they were under the gun to tweak enough stuff to make it play really well, and make a lot of people very jealous.<br />
Personally, I think they nailed it perfectly.<br />
Somewhere around 2am, Greg and I headed out for his place in very east Burnaby. We stayed up for a short while and talked, but we were both so tired, we opted for sleep instead.<br />
Sunday morning came around 9:30. I was still exhausted from the day before, but rose and showered and prepared for the day. Not there was much to prepare for &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much on the agenda. A quick breakfast at IHOP, and we went back into the office. We weren&#8217;t there too long, as I had to go to the airport. This time, Greg drove me out, which I was thankful for (the transit strike makes getting a taxi outside of the airport rather difficult). I bid him farewell, he drove back to work, and I checked in for the flight.<br />
I slept on the way back, though not intentionally. I was utterly wiped. I hadn&#8217;t been so active in so long that my body simply wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I vaguely remember something about 35,000 feet, and something about returning my seat to its original upright position. Next thing I knew, I was hopping the bus home. And as we all know, home is where the heart, bed, and 50&#8243; TV are. This was where I was determined to spend the next several hours &#8230; sleeping.<br />
Unfortunately, it seemed that my vacation would be cut short. Crisis at Critical Mass &#8212; the site I was working on had basically fallen apart in my absence. Somehow, I&#8217;d become the centre of communications, and without me around, everything came to a halt. I didn&#8217;t get home until 1:30am.<br />
I look back at my weekend, and I actually have to force myself to believe I was actually there. With all the apprehension I had towards going back, I now find it hard to believe I did it. But I know I did, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad I saw my friends again (despite the fact that I feel like a twit for forgetting names). I&#8217;m glad I saw a Blue Jays game (even though they lost). But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that my past is now just that &#8212; behind me. All that&#8217;s left is the possibility of the future.<br />
Vancouver is a destination for me. Not to live, but certainly to visit. I will see sights I never saw, I will do things I never got the chance to do. I&#8217;m content that no matter what I see and do, it was because of me (with a lot of support from my family and friends) that I&#8217;m capable of doing it. And so long as I know people in Vancouver, or at least have an inkling of a reason, I will go there, and I will enjoy myself each and every minute.<br />
At least when it isn&#8217;t raining.</p>

		<p>Someone&#8217;s out to get me, I swear. Unfortunately, that someone is probably me.<br />
This has got to have been one of the most hectic weekends I can remember. Here&#8217;s the general gist of some of the things that were going on:</p>
<ol>
<li>A project deadline (for our largest client) that was due yesterday.</li>
<li>Several planned family meals.</li>
<li>My mother&#8217;s birthday.</li>
<li>A friend in town.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know it doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but the overall effect was unbelievably distressing, and the victims ended up being my mother, my father, and myself. My father, you ask? Well, I just came the realization that today is his birthday, and I forgot to call. (I have a lame excuse &#8212; I dropped my cell phone the other day, and the antenna broke, pretty much rendering it useless until I get it fixed. I haven&#8217;t had the time to get it fixed yet.) So dad, I apologize for not calling &#8212; I&#8217;ll make an effort to call tomorrow.<br />
The weekend started on Thursday night, with another Hitmen hockey game. I&#8217;ll have to dispense with the details, as much as I would love to recount the game &#8212; it was a thrilling one. It was the first night in a while that I had left the office early. Even without the game, I still would have left &#8212; the power was being shut off to install our server room UPS system. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know what a UPS is, it&#8217;s basically a giant battery.)<br />
The next morning (after attempting to catch up on the weeks of sleep I&#8217;ve managed to fall behind on) Chris and I went over to my cousin Pam&#8217;s new home for a massive family brunch. This included my aunt, uncle, and cousin from Calgary, Pam and her parents, Pam&#8217;s aunt and uncle (who also live in Calgary), her boyfriend, our grandmother (Nana), and my mother, who had flown out to Calgary for Easter. It was also her birthday, which her brother was all too willing to bring to light.<br />
Brunch was huge &#8212; lots of fruit, pastries, eggs, bacon, a spinach pie that was to die for, and champagne and orange juice. It didn&#8217;t take long for Chris and I (and just about everyone else) to overfill. Yes, it was going to be another one of &#8220;those&#8221; weekends (see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]]) &#8212; non-stop food. Luckily for me, I was going to be locking myself in the office, keeping me from eating too much &#8230; in theory, anyway.<br />
Around 1pm, Chris and I made our exit. I had to go to work to work on the aforementioned project deadline. But first, I had to swing by Chinook Centre to get mom a birthday present. No, I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get her one yet &#8212; and my previous attempts had yielded no fruit. Success was not far away, however, and I was soon heading back towards the office.<br />
I worked away until almost 5:45, at which point I had to leave to go to dinner at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s, in honour of my mother&#8217;s birthday. I made a quick side trip by the Greyhound station to drop off Carl (Critical Mass&#8217;s newest Web Developer) so he could go to Invermere, and then stopped by the apartment to pick up the photographs of Julie&#8217;s wedding (which had been meant to show around, but in the chaos of returning from Ontario after Christmas, disappeared into the &#8220;Behind The Couch&#8221; void).<br />
Almost 45 minutes late arriving, the six of us (my aunt, uncle, cousin Jen, Nana, my mom, and me) had a wonderful dinner. The centrepiece was a Cajun marinated steak, served with a fruit salsa that made the flavours just pop out. I never thought fruit could be used so cleverly.<br />
Around 10pm, my body was screaming for rest. I withdrew my presence and retreated to the comforts of my apartment, where I attempted to fall asleep in front of the TV. However, I was at that uncomfortable point in exhaustion where you&#8217;re actually too tired to sleep. I stayed that way until Chris came home from his almost-but-not-quite date, and suggested we go to Pongo for a while.<br />
I gotta learn to stop doing stuff like that when I&#8217;m exhausted.<br />
The next morning came far too early, despite being noon. I felt like I&#8217;d only slept an hour. But back to the office I went. I slaved away until about 3:30, when I returned home to prepare for the next round of family engagements. We were off to Ron and Dawn&#8217;s home (my aunt Alaine&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law) for a pre-dinner get-together. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jen in attendance &#8212; I had assumed she wouldn&#8217;t have come. But Jen, unlike myself at her age, is quite willing to experiment with new foods.<br />
We hobnobbed until 7:15, at which time we headed en masse to Bodega, a Spanish tapas bar about four blocks from our apartment. I&#8217;d been there one time before, on a pseudo-business lunch, when our office had literally been around the corner. It was an excellent meal, and I was looking forward to having it again.<br />
All 17 of us piled into the little restaurant, taking up a large (and loud) portion of the tables. For the next four hours or so, we ate, talked, drank, shared in Jen&#8217;s drawings (my cousin is becoming quite the artist, and is adept at on-the-spot works of art), and were merry. For a short while, I forgot how tired I really was.<br />
When we finally left (in the vicinity of 11:15pm), I returned to the apartment to pass out. Chris again tried to coax me out for an evening, but I (fortunately) said &#8216;no&#8217;. I&#8217;m not even sure if I heard Chris leave. Somewhere between Chris leaving and the alarm going off the next morning, I&#8217;d managed to haul myself to bed.<br />
I awoke early to get in some work at the office before Easter brunch with Stuart, Therese, and Jordon (one of our co-workers and friends) at &#8220;The Ranche&#8221;, a restaurant in Fish Creek Park in the south of Calgary. It used to be a ranch house back in the day, but is now the home of a mid-upscale eatery. A very filling (and tasty) repast, but a little too long in length.<br />
As we were heading back, my mom called. I had hoped to spend some more time with her before she had to go to the airport, but there were simply not enough hours in the day. Her phone call reminded me that the clock doesn&#8217;t stop. I broke just about every speed limit dropping Chris and Jordon off at Chinook Centre and then hauling myself up to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house. Not even five minutes after arriving, I was taking my mom to the airport.<br />
Despite her protests, I saw her to the gate. I had seen my mother for a collective 8-10 hours over the course of four days, but had only really visited with her for a small fraction of that. I wanted what little time there was left to see her before she left. Before I knew it, she was passing through security. Three entire days vanished before my eyes.<br />
Returning to the office, I tried to finish off the last of the known work. There were still issues to be solved, but we were having problems with the back-end code, and couldn&#8217;t find the developers to fix it. I continued at the problems until Greg called.<br />
Greg had been in town since late Friday. He had called me on the Saturday, but I had simply not the time to call him back. At 7pm Sunday night, I got together with Greg for a couple of short hours. A few beers, a few conversations and debates over my choice of Academy Award winners (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and a short walk around town, I returned Greg to his aunt&#8217;s, arriving home at 11:15pm.<br />
Yesterday was a blur. Too many things to do, not enough time. Same with today, which is why I only noticed 30 minutes ago that it was my father&#8217;s birthday, and I&#8217;d forgotten it. So again, sorry Dad &#8212; I didn&#8217;t mean to forget.<br />
But at least Easter&#8217;s over. Maybe now I can get some rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p><em>Blepharospasm (n.)</em>:<br />
The repetitive contraction of eyelid muscles in a rhythmic fashion. In some instances, the eyelid may repeatedly close or attempt to close. The most common causes of muscle twitching in the eyelid are fatigue or stress.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how I managed to notice that I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass for a year and a day. Well, not so much the blepharospasm as it was the stress that keeping bringing it back.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been here a year. I&#8217;ll forego with torturing you with the recap (you can stop cheering now), but suffice to say it&#8217;s been quite the year. Made a lot of new friends, and missed a lot of old ones. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of the rise of Critical Mass &#8230; and I&#8217;m really hoping that I never need to experience the fall. With luck, our management will keep us in check and we&#8217;ll just keep on sailing.<br />
Hmm. I guess &#8220;surfing&#8221; would be a more appropriate word.<br />
So back that that stress and fatigue thing&#8230; This was something I really hoped to avoid this year, but that was one New Year&#8217;s resolution that got shot down in short order. Too much dedication to my job, I guess. Either that or obsession. Not sure which. (Some argue one way, some the other.)<br />
Been working like a dog again (woof, woof). (Has anyone actually seen a dog work? All the ones I ever saw just laid around all day. What I wouldn&#8217;t give to be a dog for a couple days right now.) I keep forgetting that the more senior you get, the more work seems to migrate in your direction. And while I try to pawn as much of it off to others as I can, there are a handful of projects that (for now) only I can do. Blech.<br />
I just hope this doesn&#8217;t get any worse. People get insomnia from this kind of thing. I don&#8217;t get enough sleep as it is without being able to catch a few Zs. Next thing you know, I&#8217;ll be fighting myself in parking lots, being two people, and planning to blow up credit card companies.<br />
But I&#8217;m not my freaking khakis just yet&#8230;</p>

		<p>Who&#8217;d ever have thought that I would one day become the centre of attention?<br />
Okay, be invited to come near the centre of attention&#8230;<br />
Alright! Be allowed to look towards the centre of attention from a far away, but otherwise intrusive distance. Ya happy now?<br />
Sheesh&#8230;<br />
I can&#8217;t remember when I&#8217;ve had a less productive weekend, except when I was either on vacation or was entertaining visitors. But there were no such distractions this weekend. Instead, we were flitting around like we were &#8230; *gasp* &#8230; popular.<br />
It all started Friday afternoon, at just after 5:00pm. A large portion of the company, exact number unknown, all headed down to the Drum &amp; Monkey pub to wish our now former co-worker (but still friend) Ben. Ben&#8217;s off to slightly greener pastures in Edmonton. Ben was a very visible person around here, and a lot of people (myself grudgingly included) will miss him a lot.<br />
So, yeah, we all got drunk.<br />
Ben has a few interesting friends, who also attended the little affair. One of them was the host of A Channel&#8217;s morning show. (A Channel is our local CityTV-owned independent rabble-rousing station.) Ben used to work at A Channel, and had invited them along. I attempted to introduce myself to him. Unfortunately, not only could I not place him to save my life, I was &#8230; um &#8230; slightly incapacitated. It went something like this:<br />
Him: Hi, you&#8217;re some of Ben&#8217;s co-workers, right?<br />
Us: It shows that badly, eh?<br />
(He starts to go around the table, introducing himself, starting with me.)<br />
Me: (A little louder than I normally talk, and slightly slurred.) Hi, I&#8217;m Geoff. This is gonna sound really stupid, but have we met somewhere before?<br />
(I kid you not, that is the first time I&#8217;ve ever used that line. I just wish, in retrospect, I&#8217;d used it to talk to an attractive woman, instead of some guy who&#8217;s name I still can&#8217;t remember.)<br />
Him: (Not missing a beat) Yeah, I used to buy all that LSD from you out behind the Cecil!<br />
Me: (Surprisingly also not missing a beat &#8212; yeah, I know, it&#8217;s rare, but it does happen) No, I sold heroin. I don&#8217;t deal with that wimpy sh*t.<br />
Him: Yeah yeah yeah! I remember now &#8212; sorry, I was usually too stoned to notice.<br />
Me: Not a problem, you get used to it in my line of work.<br />
For the record, I have never dealt any form of drug (illicit, or otherwise), nor have I sampled anything but alcohol.<br />
I hopped tables most of the night, wandering from conversation to conversation (participating for a while in a semi-strategic discussion with George (one of our account managers), and the guy from A Channel &#8212; he must think I&#8217;m a total freak by now), meeting new people (most of whom I&#8217;ve now forgotten), and generally causing trouble. But hey, what else are you gonna do when you&#8217;re out getting drunk?<br />
We all started departing around 10:45 or so (I really don&#8217;t know what time it was, I&#8217;m just taking estimates from when I first saw the clock when I finally got home). A small number of us were heading over to a place called Calypso&#8217;s, which is one of the white trash bars in Calgary. Luckily positioned right next door to our apartment building. Why there? Easy: Karaoke.<br />
No, I didn&#8217;t sing. Aside from the fact that I can&#8217;t (and have a serious case of stage fright), I was also crashing fast. Even with a caffeinated beverage to attempt to offset the sleepiness, I was at home shortly after 11:30. Chris, on the other hand, was ready for Phase II of the evening (he had left the Drum &amp; Monkey a little earlier) &#8212; he was going to meet with the people at Calypso&#8217;s.<br />
The following day was marked with me at work. (There&#8217;s a surprise.) But only for three hours. Then it was back home to prepare for the evening &#8212; we had a birthday to go to. But first, we decided to go see a movie (Spy Kids &#8212; yeah, it&#8217;s a kid&#8217;s movie, but it&#8217;s a good, funny kids movie) with our friend (and co-worker) Tamara.<br />
After the movie, Chris and I walked over to Kensington for Chrissie&#8217;s birthday. Chrissie is one of our Project Managers, and though we really don&#8217;t know her that well, we thought it would be fun. But first, it was over to Safeway. Just as we reached the bridge to cross the Bow River, I suddenly realized that we had no gift to bring [insert bad &#8220;Little Drummer Boy&#8221; joke here]. So did Chris, only he had a good idea &#8212; flowers. So instead of going directly to Bass Brothers (the pub where Chrissie&#8217;s birthday celebration was in full swing), we stopped by Safeway to pick up some white roses.<br />
The roses were &#8230; well, Chrissie told us that she was going to make a lot of phone calls today and brag. I&#8217;ll let you pick your own description as to how happy/overjoyed/ecstatic she was. Either way, it scored major brownie points for Chris and I &#8230; now we just gotta use &#8217;em while they&#8217;re still good.<br />
We hung out at the pub for about two hours or so, before deciding to keep on going. You see, for perhaps the first time in my life (I&#8217;m not sure about Chris), we actually had multiple invitations (okay, two), and we didn&#8217;t want to disappoint.<br />
Arif, our other inviter, had said that the second soiree of the night wouldn&#8217;t get moving until midnight. Chris and I took the opportunity to get something to eat at Pongo&#8217;s first, before braving the wilds of a party where we knew two people.<br />
We arrived at Arif&#8217;s friend Kim&#8217;s house around 1:30 or so. (Yes, in the morning.) It was packed with strange people. So naturally, we fit right in. We mingled as best we could, but it wouldn&#8217;t be until later in the evening that I found I was able to mingle without being near Chris (unlike my friend, I find a bit of libation takes the edge of my awkwardness).<br />
We arrived home just before 5:00am. (Technically 4:00am, but there was that goofy time change. I wish we&#8217;d just get rid of that.) I promptly passed out.<br />
My alarm went off at 10:30. I was so not ready for it. But it was a dim sum morning, and there are some things that are worth getting up for. We met Jordon (yet another co-worker and friend), and Stuart and Therese at Silver Dragon, where we promptly disposed of a dangerously high stock of delicious bite-sized Chinese edibles. This, for us, is almost a ritual now. But it&#8217;s one, that unless I&#8217;m mistaken, is beginning to become too routine. It&#8217;s almost to the point where I &#8230; and I shudder to say this &#8230; don&#8217;t want to have it every Sunday. I actually think I&#8217;ve had it too much.<br />
Following dim sum, the four of them went off for their afternoon (Therese to work, and the other three to no good) and I went off to the Calgary Hitmen hockey game.<br />
This was the sixth (and potentially deciding) game in the series. You could certainly tell that there were a lot of very avidly interested people (9,022 in all, according to attendance figures) going &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t miss the cars and pedestrians. No-one cared that there&#8217;s been a transit strike here for about a month &#8212; they still showed up in droves. The Saddledome wasn&#8217;t packed &#8212; but considering it&#8217;s minor league hockey, it was a solid turnout.<br />
Before I continue, a couple of corrections. Some of the Observer&#8217;s Log&#8217;s avid readers caught me on my knowledge of hockey. I would like to state, for the records, that I know sqwat about sports. I went to the first game because it sounded like fun. I went to the second game because the first one *was* fun.<br />
First off, the Hitmen and the Pats play in the Western Hockey League, not the World Hockey League, as I had originally assumed. My bad. As for the Pats, their name has a long history. To save myself a heap of typing, I&#8217;ll just take Joel&#8217;s explanation:<br />
The Regina Pats Hockey Club is the oldest major junior hockey franchise in existence, first stepping on the ice in 1917. Over the past 82 years, there have been several stories as to how the team got its name, but the truth is the name came from both Princess Patricia, granddaughter of Queen Victoria (this is also where the Princess Patricia&#8217;s Canadian Light Infantry Regiment, organized at the outbreak of World War I, got its name). A top-level junior hockey team began play in Regina in 1917, and went by the name &#8220;Patricias&#8221; until 1923, when it was shortened to &#8220;Pats&#8221;. The hockey club won the Memorial Cup for junior hockey supremacy in 1925 under the guidance of the legendary Al Ritchie.<br />
So there you go, and now you know. Joel also added that he&#8217;s also not a hockey fan, but had been to Pats games. His reasoning being: &#8220;What else is there to do growing up on the Prairies?&#8221;<br />
I think that explains the crowd in the Saddledome. The noise was booming even before the game started. But once it did, it became a madhouse. The Hitmen literally exploded in the first 15 minutes of the game, and the Pats looked like there were trying to fight off an angry pack of rottweilers. (I can only assume this was partly due to the cheap shot one of the Pats had made at the end of the last Calgary game, and because the Hitmen really wanted to wrap this series up.) The first period ended in a 1-1 tie.<br />
The audience was revved. Toronto Blue Jays fans are quiet folk. Calgary Hitmen fans are not &#8212; you should hear 9,000 people in the Saddledome cheering on minor league hockey. It&#8217;s unreal. Not to mention deafening.<br />
Like the previous game, the breaks between plays were interspersed with contests and prize giveaways (I can only assume to entice people to come out &#8212; it&#8217;s otherwise distracting from the game). During the first intermission, they had even more entertainment &#8212; former WWF wrestler Brett &#8220;The Hitman&#8221; Hart against a pack of angry 10-year-old midget hockey players. They had to flip him on his back, for some goofy reason.<br />
Hockey&#8217;s a strange sport.<br />
The second period could only be described as an utter disaster. The Hitmen had more or less fallen apart. Although they got another goal, the Pats got two. And the Pats were the ones in control. They were swarming. They were passing. They were making the Hitmen really angry, and the Hitmen were responding &#8230; with penalties. A lot of &#8217;em. That&#8217;s how the Pats pulled ahead.<br />
It affected the crowd, too. They started to get quieter. Even when one of the Hitmen managed to get the puck and skate towards the Pats&#8217; goal, the now-normal rise in cheering was more subdued. The energy was gone.<br />
Something happened during the second intermission in the Hitmen&#8217;s locker room. I don&#8217;t know what the coach said, or what performance-enhancing drugs they took, but the Hitmen were breathing fire when they came back out on the ice. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen as good hockey played &#8230; ever. The first 13 minutes of the third period were really good &#8212; the crowd noticed too. But the energy in the crowd&#8217;s cheering didn&#8217;t come back.<br />
Not until Brendl scored a the tying goal at 13:15 in the period. No-one was sitting down. You could barely hear the announcer. Now the crowd got loud.<br />
The chanting was deafening. I actually felt a little sorry for the Pats. You could see the Hitmen actually playing better the louder the crowd got. All you could hear was &#8220;Go Hitmen, Go!&#8221; and rhythmic thumping through the stands. People were cheering, crying, roaring &#8230; and going hoarse very quickly.<br />
The game intensified &#8212; playoff Olympic hockey isn&#8217;t this good. The puck changed ends constantly. The Hitmen wanted to win the game to finish the series. The Pats wanted to win to stay alive. Both wanted the game, bad.<br />
With less than a minute left, I was really to call for overtime. But I didn&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t know why. It&#8217;s probably a good thing, too. With less than 15 seconds left in the game, Brendl swooped down the ice, swerved around the Pats&#8217; defenders, and scooped the puck in the net.<br />
I, like every other capable person in the Saddledome, flew out of my seat. Not only did I nearly wrench my right arm out of its socket (still not sure how I did that), but I could feel my vocal chords tearing apart from my unearthly screaming. My ears were ringing. You couldn&#8217;t hear anything &#8212; not even the overly-loud high-bass music. All you could hear were the blood-curdling screams and ear-piercing whistles of 9,000 crazed fans.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you weren&#8217;t already deaf.<br />
No-one sat down for the last 15 seconds of the game. The Hitmen just let the clock run out. The cheering barely stopped during that time, and only increased when the game was officially over. Now we&#8217;re aiming for tickets for when they come back in the next round of playoffs (not sure if it&#8217;s semi-finals or finals).<br />
And now I&#8217;m back at work, but only to catch up on email. Soon, I&#8217;ll head home to finish of my weekend with the most exciting thing yet.<br />
Laundry.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, I saw my first hockey game in about 20 years. When you&#8217;re able to count the last time you did something in decades, you know you&#8217;re getting old.<br />
The last time I saw a hockey game, I was about seven years old (I&#8217;m taking a guess at this, because I honestly don&#8217;t remember). It was between the Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks (as far as I can remember). I don&#8217;t remember who won, nor do I really remember the game. All I do remember is sitting on the east side of the rink, and remarking that unlike Maple Grove Arena, the seats weren&#8217;t freezing.<br />
Tonight, I saw Calgary&#8217;s WHL (Western Hockey League, for those of you who don&#8217;t recognize the acronym) team &#8212; the Hitmen &#8212; in a playoff game against the Regina Pats.<br />
