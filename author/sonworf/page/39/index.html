	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life&#8217;s a beach.<br />
At least, it should be.<br />
Last weekend was the second busy weekend for Allison and I, the second weekend of the month we weren&#8217;t home. We won&#8217;t be home for a weekend probably until mid-August at the pace things are currently going. Every weekend has something new for us to explore. Frankly, this is a good thing &#8230; provided the weather holds out.<br />
We left on Friday night, meeting at Horseshoe Bay. Knowing that traffic would be a nightmare, Allison left from the apartment early. I left downtown on the 5:07 express to Horseshoe Bay, arriving a mere five minutes before Allison.<br />
We dropped the car off at the Park and Ride, which the local Lion&#8217;s Club. Normally, the lot is free, you just have to walk the kilometre or so to the ferry terminal. When the Lion&#8217;s are about, you have to pay a paltry $5/day (a bargain compared to the other lots), and you get a free ride to the terminal.<br />
We were somewhat excited to find that we would be taking one of the mythical Fast Ferries, the first of which went into service on 1 July. It was supposed to leave at 18:00. We boarded it at 18:07. Needless to say, the Fast Ferry hasn&#8217;t been running exactly up to snuff just yet&#8230;<br />
The Fast Ferry is a catamaran with twin water jet propulsion systems. They run at a supposed 45 knots, making the trip in just under an hour. Supposedly. In actuality, it runs at about 37 knots, and in the long run, might save you about five minutes, all told. Why?<br />
Because we let the government design it, that&#8217;s why.<br />
All fairness aside, they did try. But as Yoda once said: &#8220;Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.&#8221; The design would work well for longer-haul trips. However, the design is not exactly well-suited to the short jaunts across the Strait. You see &#8212; the ship points in only one direction.<br />
Why is that significant? All the other ships point in two directions, allowing them to be driven from either end. No turning, no slowing down to back in; just straight-forward (no pun intended) driving. The Fast Ferry is a uni-directional ship. It has to be turned around before it can go anywhere. It needs a dollar to turn on a dime.<br />
This means that for one leg of the trip, the ship has to turn around at both ends &#8212; otherwise, the cars can&#8217;t get off without backing up themselves. As it stands, it takes too long to empty the ship without people having to drive off in reverse.<br />
And the wake. Homeowners around Bowen Island (which the ferries all pass) have been shocked at the near-tsunami conditions that the ferry generates. It threatens to rip up docks and smash boats against the shore. BC Ferries contends that the wake is minimal.<br />
Minimal, my heiny&#8230;<br />
On the way back, we were on a good ol&#8217; regular ferry. When the Fast Ferry rocketed past us, it sent our ship rocking &#8212; the only time in dozens of crossing that Allison and I have been on where I could actually feel the ship rock due to waves.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me started on the interior &#8220;features&#8221; either. I&#8217;ll just leave my opinion at this: The government would have been far better off spending the money on upgrading our existing ferries and making sure that the less-travelled (but still necessary) routes don&#8217;t suffer due to lack of funds. Heck, you could have built two regular ferries for the price it cost to build one Fast Ferry.<br />
And there are two more coming off the assembly line.<br />
Anyway, we arrived in Nanaimo about one hour and 20 minutes after we left West Vancouver and proceeded to the Collins Family Estate, in the prestigious Divers Lake area. There we were subdued by the plethora of relatives who had descended on the household for the weekend.<br />
It was Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday party. The second one. As you may recall (see [[Snow in Vancouver, Dinner on the Island]]), we had already attended a birthday party at The Grotto in Nanaimo. However, it wasn&#8217;t exactly suitable for a large get-together of friends, so the official party was postponed until the weekend past.<br />
The following morning, we rose and dressed for the occasion. Although not a formal event, we were obviously not going to show up in loud pink shirts and spandex shorts, so we dressed in beige pants and blue shirts.<br />
I&#8217;m not kidding. We really did.<br />
This, of course, was an accident. Neither Allison or I had heard each other the night we packed to leave &#8212; we had inadvertently packed virtually the same outfit. This is not just a fashion faux pas &#8212; it looks really weird. So avoid confusion and embarrassment, I raided Randy&#8217;s closet for a different shirt. It turned out that I grabbed a shirt that Randy had never worn &#8212; it has just been given to him from Mr. Collins. Luckily, though, it fit.<br />
Overall, it was a good party, although Allison and I didn&#8217;t move around too much, we spent most of our time talking to old friends of family (that I didn&#8217;t know), cousins, and Grandma Collins. We didn&#8217;t really know many others.  Late in the afternoon, Grandma Vailmont (the one basically running the whole show) abducted me to play bocci.<br />
Bocci is a bit of a religion there. You can&#8217;t escape it. If you go to a Vailmont family get-together, you&#8217;ll probably end up playing bocci. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t know how &#8212; you&#8217;ll learn. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t like it &#8212; you will. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you have no arms &#8212; someone will throw for you. Resistance is futile.<br />
I ended up on a team with Janet, Mrs. Collins&#8217; cousin, and two of Allison&#8217;s cousins, Kersten (9) and Mitchell (4). Both are young. Like most siblings, they fight a fair bit.<br />
I will wholeheartedly admit that I forgot was sibling rivalry was like &#8212; it had been a very long time since my sister and I had a good screaming match. (We now sit around the kitchen table, drink beer, and discuss finances. My how the times change.)<br />
It was exceptionally difficult to play a close game. If one side got too far ahead, one of the two siblings would be upset. Janet and I got very good at placing balls close to the marker ball, and far away from the marker ball. We adjusted our strategies depending on the accuracy of the younger two&#8217;s throws. In the end, Mitchell (the younger of the two) won by a mere point. Kersten, despite losing, was not upset.<br />
When the party finally ended, it took those of us remaining only a short period of time to clean everything up. As we retreated to the Collins Family Estate, Vicki (one of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters) announced a barbeque at Rathtrevor Beach the following day.<br />
Rathtrevor Beach is the Bay of Fundy of the west coast &#8230; only horizontal. Whereas the Bay of Fundy has very high tides, Rathtrevor Beach has very long tides. If you arrive at the beach at low tide, you&#8217;ll find yourself walking well over a kilometre to find water &#8230; even further to find water deep enough to come up to your neck (assuming you stand 5&#8242; 11 7/8&#8243;).<br />
At any rate, the beach is huge. Gigantic. Enormous. And despite the number of people who show up, virtually empty. This leads to things such as sandcastles, kite-flying, and lots of people walking aimlessly. In short, typical beach-going behaviour.<br />
Upon arriving at the beach, we had to take Kersten and Mitchell out onto the beach &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t wait. Mind you, neither could I. The last time I was on an ocean beach (or a saltwater beach, depending on how you look at it) for the purposes of sitting in the sun and doing beach-related things was in 1991. (Yes, I know I went to the beach in Monterey last year, but it was way too cold to even consider swimming.) It had been a long time since I had walked across a good beach.<br />
And boy, do you every have a long walk. Because the beach is so expansive, it also has a lot of interesting features, most notably tidal pools. Although devoid of fish, the pools have lots of shellfish, crabs, and snails. You can imagine the kids&#8217; reaction to those. Most revolved around &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;ewwww!&#8221;. Allison, Robin (another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters), and Wilma (yet another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters, who lives in Germany) gave out marine biology lessons to those of us not quite up-to-snuff with the proper information. While I&#8217;m at, I&#8217;ll mention Mrs. Collins&#8217; last unmentioned sibling, Laura &#8212; Kersten and Mitchell are her children.<br />
What do you associate sand dollars with? Tropical waters, right? Take a wild guess what thrives all over Rathtrevor Beach? Yep &#8230; thousands of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re everywhere. You can&#8217;t take any of them with you &#8212; that&#8217;s a no-no. But you can pick them up and see what they look like while they&#8217;re still alive. Black ones are living &#8230; the whitish ones have since deceased.<br />
Finally reaching the ocean, we waded in a little ways and splashed around a bit. Baby flatfish (halibut or flounders, probably) skitted about our feet, trying to get away from the two-footed giants traipsing through the middle of their sanctuary.<br />
A few minutes later, we realised that the water was about to soak all the things we&#8217;d left on shore to stay dry. The tide was turning, and beginning to reclaim the shore. It was time to go back for lunch.<br />
After partaking in much the same food as we&#8217;d had the day before, several of us ventured back out onto the beach to build a sandcastle. Initially just Brenna, Kersten, and Mitchell, I soon followed, with several others not far behind. The construction was hasty, mostly because the tide was coming in fairly quickly.<br />
As Brenna build the castle with Kersten and Mitchell, I quickly built an outer wall, designed to keep the water away for a short period of time. The wall wouldn&#8217;t hold the water out indefinitely, but it would at least make for a more interesting destruction of the castle.<br />
Sure enough, the water soon arrived, so Kersten and Mitchell took refuge in their sandy kingdom &#8230; for a few precious minutes. Eventually, the tide ate away at the walls, no thanks to the surrounding adults who were surreptitiously splashing the walls, hastening their demise. The flood inside the walls soon took down the castle&#8217;s structure, ending the brief reign of King Mitchell and Queen Kersten.<br />
Following a short swim in the now-flooded beach, we packed up and headed home. Although we could have made the 19:00 ferry to Vancouver, Allison and I waited until the 21:00. In retrospect, this was a good idea &#8230; we would have travelled on a Fast Ferry, and we all know what I think of them.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Deciding that the weather here had become too unbearable to stand for another weekend, let alone a long weekend, Allison and I opted to abdicate the Lower Mainland for places sunnier.<br />
At least, that was the plan.<br />
I booked Friday off (don&#8217;t you just hate it when the holiday lands on anything but Friday or Monday?), we packed a few things into a cooler (namely the two tonnes of fruit we received in our organic vegetable delivery &#8212; yes, I know I&#8217;m turning into a hippie), and started driving towards the Okanagan.<br />
Within a couple of hours, we noticed that the rain was beginning to slowly subside. At first, we managed to elude Mother Nature. Every time I said &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s some blue sky!&#8221;, she figured out where we had disappeared to, and covered over all vestiges of the sun.<br />
Arriving in Merritt shortly after noon, we stopped for lunch and a rest break. Having been chastised for jinxing the weather earlier in the trip, I had not said one word about the conditions. As a result, Mother Nature lost track of us again, and the weather was warm and bright. A bit windy too, so we ate lunch in the car for fear of blowing away with the tumbleweeds.<br />
Leaving the Coquihalla highway behind us, we headed towards the Okanagan Valley. This trip, roughly an hour from Merritt, is plagued with many dangers: Severe Winter Weather, tight corners, and many examples of &#8220;driverius moronicus&#8221;. One particular specimen opted to pass three cars (of which I was the lead) right in front of on-coming traffic. The on-coming traffic had to bolt over to the shoulder to prevent a head-on collision. If I had not noticed this happening, we could probably have been in an accident. Had I been a bit quicker, I would have gladly jotted down the turkey&#8217;s license and turned him into the RCMP&#8230;<br />
Arriving alive and unscathed in Kelowna around 1:30pm, we headed in the direction of my relative&#8217;s home. While in Kelowna, we were staying at the luxurious Chateau Tisdale, situated near the shores of Lake Okanagan. Thinking that both my aunt and uncle were working, I thought it best that we show up a bit later.<br />
This gave us the opportunity to sight see a little.<br />
Our first stop was the Kettle Valley planned community. This is a development that some genius thought up a few years ago. On a rather large chunk of land just south of Kelowna, developers are building a very large community, complete with town centre, schools, and character homes. In fact, the entire development is full of character &#8212; Victorian-style homes currently dot the area.<br />
The development is far from complete. It will probably take 20 years or more to finish the development. But it will be very nice when it&#8217;s full of families.<br />
We stopped into the office and one of the show homes to see what it was like. In addition to being considerably cheaper than homes in the Lower Mainland, the homes were high quality, and very nice. We were a bit surprised that none of the salespeople gave us the hard sell. We weren&#8217;t sure if it was because that was their style, or if it was because we looked too young. (We always get the hard sell out here.)<br />
From the Kettle Valley development, we headed back towards my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home. Along the way, we opted to stop into the Summerhill Winery. (So we found out, it&#8217;s a law that all tourists have to stop into at least one winery while in the Okanagan. We had somehow managed to avoid it the first couple of times, but didn&#8217;t want to run the risk of a large fine for breaking the law this time.)<br />
As we rounded the corner, we saw the winery&#8217;s piece de resistance &#8230; a large white pyramid. I&#8217;ll get back to that in a moment or two&#8230;<br />
We pulled into the parking lot, and quickly found two things: 1) There was a free &#8220;sparking wine&#8221; tour, and 2) We missed lunch by about 10 minutes. We stuck around for the 3:00pm tour.<br />
Our tour guide, so we figured, was a ski hill enthusiast working for the summer. (Another weird BC law states that the wineries, in return for getting mandatory visits by all the tourists, also has to hire all the ski bums who can&#8217;t ski during the summer.) She was a good speaker, I will admit, although she did exhibit a bit of attitude.<br />
She took us around the winery, showing us the grapes Summerhill grows, the machines used to press the grapes &#8230; I&#8217;m going to pause here a moment. Interesting things to know about pressing grapes:<br />
Summerhill presses their grapes to roughly 65% of their volume (this is called the &#8220;first pressing&#8221;), then mulches the left overs (including the stems and leaves of the grapes), and puts it back out in the field as fertilizer. Other wineries go to a second pressing, and even a third pressing. The guide expressed her disdain for additional pressings, saying that other wineries weren&#8217;t concerned about quality if they went to these additional pressings. Although she wouldn&#8217;t name names, she did say that the third pressing was usually referred to as the &#8220;rotting grape&#8221;. &#8216;Nuff said.<br />
(Additional note, which I&#8217;ll add before Allison does: Fourth pressings usually become grape juice, and the leftovers are turned into fruit leather. Summerhill, obviously, does not do this.)<br />
Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, we saw the machines used to press the grapes, and then we went into the winery building to see where all the magic takes place. Sparking wine (technically, it *is* champagne, but because &#8220;champagne&#8221; is trademarked for wineries in the Champagne region of France, no-one outside that area can use the term &#8220;champagne&#8221;; look for &#8220;methode classique&#8221; instead) is a work-intensive beverage.<br />
After the wine is left in vats to ferment for a while, it is bottled and capped with bottle caps. They are then shelved for three years while the yeast eats up every scrap of sugar in the wine. (This is why champagne is so dry.) Then they have to &#8220;riddle&#8221; the bottles, which is the laborious part.<br />
First, the bottles are whacked against a rubber tire to loosen up all the yeast (which is now caked to one side of the bottle). All 10,000 bottles of a batch are placed in special riddling racks, which starts the bottle out roughly horizontal. Each day, the riddler comes along, gives each bottle a quarter-turn, moving the bottle a little more vertical. (A riddler can riddle 10,000 bottles in 55 minutes.) By the end of the process, the yeast has collected in the neck of the bottle.<br />
Then the bottles are put into a glycol solution (only the first inch or so of the neck) to freeze the contents, including the leftover yeast. Then comes the fun part &#8212; removing the bottle cap. The caps keep the contents of the bottle under the pressure generated by the yeast&#8217;s by product: Carbon dioxide gas. 125 pounds per square inch of it.<br />
Needless to say, it&#8217;s a very messy process.<br />
The bottles are then topped up with a &#8220;dosange&#8221;, which guarantees 750ml of sparking wine, a little bit of sweet wine and a touch of yeast, and then the hasty corking (with a hefty cork, I might add).<br />
Definitely not a home-brew kind of project.<br />
Following bottling portion came the warehouse &#8230; the pyramid (told you I was getting back to this). It seems that the guy who set up the winery is a huge believer in the power of pyramids. (What can I say, other than the west coast attracts the weirdos.)<br />
There&#8217;s a theory that says a properly-designed pyramid will even out of the flow of tachyons (particles that move faster than the speed of light) and tardyons (particles that move slightly slower than the speed of light). Supposedly this is what causes the power of the pyramid. Instead of going sour, milk turns into yogurt; dull razors sharpen; meat petrifies rather than rots. Our guide suggested that was the reason why all the mummies in Egypt were petrified. I was about to suggest that it was because the bodies were drained of all decay-causing fluids, and then sat in natron (salt) for 40 days to dry it out &#8212; not to mention that most mummies were never in pyramids. But I kept quiet (yeah, I know, it&#8217;s a rarity).<br />
Supposedly, this makes the wine taste better. The winery had held taste tests a couple of years earlier, testing out the theory. Everyone who tasted a wine aged in a pyramid and the same wine aged normally chose the pyramid wine. Can&#8217;t tell you if it was fixed, but that&#8217;s what we were told.<br />
Then came the best part &#8230; the tasting. We were instructed how to taste wines (something which I had only partly known). If it&#8217;s a sparking wine, the first thing you do is look at the bubbles. They should be very small and fast-moving. This is the sign of a good sparking wine (or champagne). If the bubbles are large and lethargic, then you have something called &#8220;Baby Duck&#8221;. Yeah, it&#8217;s fake. If you don&#8217;t have a sparking wine, go to Step 2&#8230;<br />
Look at the clarity of the wine &#8212; it shouldn&#8217;t be cloudy. If it is, put the wine back in the bottle, take it back to the store, and have it replaced. You don&#8217;t want to be sucking back any yeast (that&#8217;s the cloudy stuff). It&#8217;s not lethal, but you&#8217;ll be wishing it was.<br />
Swirl the wine. Look at the film left on the glass. It should split into rivulets as it drains back into the wine. These are called &#8220;legs&#8221;. The thicker and slower the legs, the sweeter the wine. It&#8217;s not a precise measurement, but it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
Look into the glass, where the wine meets the glass itself. This thin barrier is called the &#8220;meniscus&#8221; (something I remember from Grade 7 science). If it&#8217;s a greenish colour (in white wine) or a brownish colour (in red wine), then the wine&#8217;s oxidized. That&#8217;s what you get for not drinking the whole bottle in one shot.<br />
Next you smell. I don&#8217;t know why, you just do. Assumedly, you&#8217;ll know if it smells bad.<br />
Finally, you get to taste it. But not really. Your first sip is rolled around in the mouth, covered all points and corners. You don&#8217;t pay attention to the taste, mostly because you have to orient your mouth to the new flavours of the wine. When you take your next sip, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what the wine actually tastes like. You aerate the wine by (quietly) slurping it. I don&#8217;t know what this does exactly, but listening to 20 retired tourists do this is kinda funny.<br />
After you&#8217;ve done all this, you can finally drink the silly thing. You have to go through this process each time you switch wines, or you won&#8217;t get the full effect.<br />
Of course, that&#8217;s assuming you give a flying fig about all that&#8230;<br />
After the sparking wine (which was quite tasty, I will say), we tried two red and two white wines. Our favourite was the GewÃ«rztraminer. It&#8217;s a sweeter wine, and goes very well with spicy foods. Allison and I also tried their icewine after I made an inquiry as to whether they had any.<br />
Most people drink wines that vary from 0 to 2 in sweetness. Most people I know won&#8217;t drink anything above a 5 &#8212; it&#8217;s too sweet. The Summerhill Riesling Icewine is an 18. None of the wine-tasting techniques work on icewine, incidentally. And if you drink icewine, don&#8217;t try to drink anything else for about 30 minutes &#8212; you won&#8217;t taste a thing.<br />
Luckily, we weren&#8217;t close to being inebriated, so we could leave shortly thereafter. We arrived at the Tisdale&#8217;s around 4:30, and were promptly hugged to death by my aunt (she wasn&#8217;t working that day, as I had thought she might). No sooner than we were sitting in the kitchen did my uncle show up, claiming that their computers had crashed again, and he didn&#8217;t see the need to stick around any longer.<br />
We talked for a couple of hours before setting into dinner mode. The barbequing duties fell on myself, which meant I had to try and not burn the steaks. I got lucky, although they were a bit too much on the well done side. (Thick steaks on an unfamiliar barbeque make for difficult work.)<br />
After dinner, we headed out for the fireworks. This entailed driving down to Kelowna&#8217;s downtown, finding a place to park, and then walking to the appropriate viewing place.<br />
So we walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
Did I mention we walked a lot?<br />
We walked.<br />
Finally, we stopped not far from the north end of town (or so it seemed), just as the fireworks got underway. Not the most spectacular show I&#8217;d seen, but it was far better than the slop Vancouver had put on the year before. It was no Symphony of Fire, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad.<br />
Following the show, we fought through the 50,000 or so people who turned out to get back to the car, and back home. We passed out within moments of hitting the pillows.<br />
We woke up the next morning to the sound of &#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; being bellowed by my uncle. We crawled out of bed and worked our way into the kitchen, to a meal of fried eggs, oranges, toast, superbly-cooked bacon, and cherries. It was a great way to start the day &#8230; especially since Mother Nature had found us again, and clouded everything over.<br />
Before I knew it, my uncle was gone. It wasn&#8217;t long before it was our turn. We bade my aunt good-bye, and then hit the road.<br />
The trip to Penticton is only about 45 minutes, and is a nice drive. Upon arriving, we hunted down our motel &#8212; the Majestic Motor Inn. Yes, the name is cheesy. So&#8217;s the interior of the room. The building was put up in the early 60&#8217;s (by my estimate). The interior hasn&#8217;t changed since then. It was almost fun (except our next door neighbour was a bit freaky).<br />
One of the reasons we were going to Penticton was to meet up with our friends, Lisa and Miran. (Lisa one of Allison&#8217;s best friends; Lisa and Miran being an item; I know Miran from university, since before I met Allison. [Insert clip of &#8220;It&#8217;s a Small World, After All&#8221; here.]) Finding their room, we found that they were nowhere to be found. So off we went.<br />
Lunch was of the order, as it had been a few hours since breakfast. We stopped at a place called &#8220;Joe&#8217;s on the Beach&#8221;, which specialised in New Orleans-style cuisine (at least, as much as the fare of a beach-front greasy spoon could be called &#8220;cuisine&#8221;). For $15, we were certainly not in the complaining mood &#8212; the meal was tasty, although large.<br />
Returning to the outside, we couldn&#8217;t help but notice one thing: Penticton was dead. Here it was, the Canada Day weekend, and the vacation town of the Okanagan was deserted. There didn&#8217;t seem to be any real reason for it.<br />
We walked down the length of Lakeshore Drive, almost to the Peach (a refreshment stand on the waterfront). Deciding we needed some refreshement, not to mention some money, we headed down Winnipeg St. towards the downtown. In a few moments, we hit upon a 7-11.<br />
It had been a really long time since I sat in front of a convenience store, eating a creamsicle and drinking a slurpee. It was kind of like being a kid again. It felt good. It felt free. It felt really really cold when I drank the slurpee too fast and followed up with a large bit of the creamsicle. Lousy brain freeze.<br />
On the way back, we stopped into the Visitor and Wine Information Centre (Penticton is roughly in the middle of the entire wine-making area, so gets the coveted Info Centre as a result). We looked around, picked up a few brochures, and then headed back to the motel.<br />
We got together with Lisa and Miran that night, under the guise of going to a barbeque at the Lake Breeze Winery, in beautiful downtown Naramata. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Naramata is some dinky little place on the eastern side of Lake Okanagan. I don&#8217;t think it has anything but vineyards and orchards, let alone a downtown.)<br />
After zigging and zagging around the countryside a little, we came to the Lake Breeze Winery, only to find that the supposed barbeque wasn&#8217;t on. No explanation, no nothing. I got the feeling that we were the only ones who didn&#8217;t know.<br />
We stopped briefly at a lookout hill on the way back, which turned out to be the mountain that bears the large &#8220;Penticton&#8221; sign, visible from Highway 97 on the opposite side of the lake.<br />
We had dinner that night at Salty&#8217;s Beachside. It tries to take its ambience from the Caribbean. I stress &#8220;tries&#8221;. The food was decent, although nothing really to write home about (which is why I&#8217;m not really mentioning anything other that we ate there).<br />
Following dinner, we retreated to Lisa and Miran&#8217;s motel room to share a bottle of wine. I believe it was a Cabernet Sauvignon from Sumac Ridge, but I could be wrong. Either way, the wine and a discussion of the pyramid at Summerhill led us to one of the weirdest conversations I&#8217;ve ever had.<br />
Miran and I attempted (and mostly failed) to properly explain Einstein&#8217;s Special Theory of Relativity. For about two hours, we tried to explain properly why for a stationary observer, time seems to slow down for someone moving close to the speed of light. (It stands to reason that the person travelling at the speed of light will, in comparison to the stationary person, age less.)<br />
Finally giving up trying to explain it fully, Allison and I went home to sleep.<br />
The next morning, we rose slowly to weather that could be best described as &#8220;spotty&#8221;. Lisa and Miran were off to Oliver to find more wineries, so Allison and I opted to check out Sumac Ridge. The primary reason was because we liked the sound of the lunch we could get at their Cellar Door bistro.<br />
And believe me &#8212; that lunch is something to write home about. Pecan and cornmeal encrusted chicken breast with apricot chutney, served with fresh baby greens with a red wine vinaigrette. Based on a suggestion, we had a glass of 97 Gewurtztraminer. The meal was preceeded by a basket of fresh breads which were absolutely scrumptious. (There&#8217;s a word I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d use.)<br />
Unfortunately, the wine had one minor problem &#8230; we were in no condition to drive anywhere. So we hopped onto the winery tour to work off the alcohol. We found that Sumac Ridge was one of the wineries Summerhill frowns upon &#8212; they do multiple pressings. (If you purchase Sumac Ridge, aim for bottles marked with &#8220;Special Reserve&#8221; &#8212; this is the batch from the first pressing.)<br />
Then it was through the coldest room I&#8217;ve ever been in. Allison and I nearly froze while our guide (another skiing enthusiast) explained why the wines were chilled to near freezing. They were settling out the yeast and a susbstance that sometimes is used in making tartar sauce. The weird things you learn at a winery&#8230;<br />
We purchased two bottles of the Gewurtztraminer (as you might expect, we really liked it) and two small bottles of icewine (at 50ml apiece, there wasn&#8217;t much) &#8212; one was for Lisa and Miran.<br />
We stopped through Summerhill on the way back, eventually buying a small bag of chocolate-covered dried cherries. Very tasty.<br />
We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing. This was, of course, a vacation &#8212; there was no need to work ourselves silly by trying to be too many places at once.<br />
Lisa called us at 6:30 to see if we were ready to go out. The first order of business was the mini-golf. Despite the fact that I quadruple-bogied a few holes, I still managed to beat the others &#8230; by a single stroke. In fact, there was a spread of only four strokes between all of us. (In short, we were all roughly the same calibre when it came to golf &#8230; although one of us was more apt to flinging balls into bushes.)<br />
Dinner was the hard part. We strolled right down the main strip without finding anything decent. We kept walking right until we were at the other end, checked out the Pentiction Resort, and finally settled on Mambo&#8217;s, the Italian eatery overlooking the lake.<br />
Dinner was supplemented by a large pitcher of sangria, but was (so I&#8217;m told) bland overall. My risoto wasn&#8217;t too bad, but the others&#8217; meals weren&#8217;t great. Dessert more than made up for it. While Lisa and Miran shared a tiramisu, Allison and I shared a meringue and vanilla ice cream platter with (real) whip cream and strawberries. Very tasty.<br />
We opted to skip the Relativity discussion that night, and made directly for bed. Getting home, I suddenly realised that Allison&#8217;s sunglass case was missing the sunglasses. Somehow, since the time Allison had given me her sunglasses (magnetic clip-ons for her regular glasses) at the mini-golf, I had managed to lose them.<br />
As you can imagine, I felt a bit like a heel that night&#8230;<br />
Mother Nature was annoyed &#8212; because we&#8217;d been moving around so much, she hadn&#8217;t been able to put clouds over us properly. She figured she&#8217;s do the job right on Sunday, though &#8212; she blanketed the entire province with clouds. And so our trip home would be a dark one.<br />
After quick checks of the mini-golf, Mambo&#8217;s, Penticon Resort, and all points in between for the missing sunglasses, I resolved to be less the cost of the replacements, and we headed towards home.<br />
Instead of the usual Coquihalla route, we tried taking Highway 3 (aka the Crow Foot trail, or some such name). After going up and down about a hundred times over the next few hours, we decided that all trips to the Okanagan would take place via the Coquihalla.<br />
Depression set back in once we reached Hope. The clouds were dark and oppressive, and the landscape looked its usual bleak green. After fighting our way through Lower Mainland morons, we pulled into home and rested from our weary trip.<br />
Ironically enough, today is full of the S-word I dare not speak, for fear of jinxing it again. With luck, it&#8217;ll hang on for a while longer&#8230;</p>

		<p>10 years.<br />
[[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Leaving Canada|I can&#8217;t believe it has been 10 years.]]<br />
On 30 June 1989, I departed for the first of what would become a string of interesting journeys into the unknown. This was my first trip out of North America, and my first trip as an Observer.<br />
I can&#8217;t help but be somewhat reflective upon the arrival of this date. 10 years, no matter who you are, is a long period of time. A lot of things can happen in 10 years &#8230; certainly that is true for me.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I&#8217;m not about to bombard you with a list of the things that have happened to me &#8212; that would be grounds for Amnesty International to boycott me for human rights violations.<br />
10 years ago, I left Canada as a naive teenager, ready to take on the world without fear, not really knowing what the outside world was like. I learned a few things on that trip, but what surprised me most were the things I learned about myself. 10 years later, I&#8217;m still surprising myself, each and every day.<br />
I suppose when I stop being surprised, I&#8217;ll stop living&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen many changes in myself, even over the past five years. Most of my friends and family have seen these changes. If you don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t changed, just remember what I was like when:<br />
a) I was in high school.<br />
b) You first met me.<br />
(For those of you who have met me within the past two years, you might not have really noticed much. So take my word for it. I&#8217;m certain those who have known me a while will back me up.)<br />
The next obvious question is: What&#8217;s in store for the next 10 years? Who knows&#8230; it could be anything. Always in motion, is the future. It&#8217;s hard to see, tough to grasp, nearly impossible to predict. That&#8217;s what I find interesting about it &#8212; the inability to classify it properly. It scares some people, frustrates others. For me, it&#8217;s another challenge to overcome.<br />
Today, the Observer is 10 years old, and is ready to enter his decade of development. With luck, the Observer will keep me young when I start getting old (particularly important, since my birthday comes up in a couple of weeks).<br />
Tomorrow, Allison and I are off to scare the inhabitants of the Okanagan. You&#8217;ll hear about it on Monday.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate monopolies. They generally treat the customer like so much belly button lint.<br />
Late last month, Allison and I decided to get Roger&#8217;s @ Home (aka &#8220;Wave&#8221;). For those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of it, better crawl out from under the bed &#8212; you&#8217;ve been down there too long. It&#8217;s Internet access through your television cable. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s always on, and it&#8217;s twice the price of dial-up.<br />
The reason we wanted to get the Wave was because Allison had decided to go freelance, and needed a way to do research, but not tie up the phone line with the access. Having the ability to download anything at any time was also a major benefit.<br />
Roger&#8217;s had a deal on where you could get your installation free if you called by May 31st. Allison called on that day (she was purchasing it, under the guise of expensing it later) and arranged for installation on June 14th at 11:00am. Fine. No problem.<br />
We&#8217;ll skip ahead a couple of weeks, mostly because there&#8217;s not really much else to fill the gap (and it would make this message really long).<br />
Roger&#8217;s calls me on my cell phone. (We have the cell phone number listed on our voice mail message at home, so it&#8217;s always fairly easy to contact us.) They wanted to change the install time from 11:00am to 9:00am. Although Allison would be at home for the technicians to show up, I figured it would be two hours she wouldn&#8217;t have to waste waiting.<br />
If we only knew&#8230;<br />
Monday morning. I&#8217;m running a tad late. Just as I head out the door, the phone rings. It&#8217;s the technician. He&#8217;s running a little late, but will arrive in 15 minutes. No problem &#8212; it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
At this point, I defer to Allison&#8217;s narrative on the events. (If I make a mistake, a correction will follow shortly.)<br />
At roughly 9:05, Allison receives a phone call from some guy confirming a Wave installation for 11:30. Allison is understandably confused &#8212; it was supposed to be five minutes ago, not 11:30 &#8230; even then, it was originally 11:00. The technician gave her the brush off, saying he couldn&#8217;t make it before 11:30. Allison made him promise, hope to die, poke a needle in his eye that he&#8217;d be there for 11:30. He said: No problem.<br />
At 9:15, a guy shows up at the apartment door (note: he did not buzz into the building), and asked for &#8220;Allison&#8221; <!--(note: not "ann-DRAY-ah", but "ANN-dree-ah")-->. He didn&#8217;t identify himself for some time. Finally, Allison took the risk, opened the door, and only then did the twit say he was there to install the Wave.<br />
I&#8217;m telling you: Belly button lint.<br />
He pulls out a box containing the cable modem (pulls the Internet signals from the TV signals), a cable splitter, and about 90 feet of cable (the cable outlet is on the opposite side of the living room). He plugs in the cable splitter, runs the cable, plugs in the modem, waits for some lights to blink, and leaves.<br />
15 minutes work.<br />
I&#8217;m in the wrong job&#8230;<br />
So you&#8217;re probably wondering at this point &#8212; what the heck was he there for, anyway? Well, Roger&#8217;s has this really inane system of installation: They send a cable technician to install the cable, and get it ready for the PC technician, who comes later.<br />
That&#8217;s who Allison now had to wait for. This shining example of the human race called at 11:26 (just four minutes before he was to appear) to inform Allison that he wasn&#8217;t going to make it. Needless to say, she was turning an interesting shade of very-pissed-off.<br />
This guy made no apologies about not showing up, about the fact that he had sworn up and down that he&#8217;d be there for 11:30, and that Allison had just wasted two hours of her time. He suggested that *we* reschedule.<br />
Um, no.<br />
After firing off a message to Roger&#8217;s (which was half-written shortly after the cable technician left), Allison went to work. We figured that we&#8217;d actually hear from Roger&#8217;s in a short period of time.<br />
Yeah, I know, we&#8217;re living in the wrong universe.<br />
By Wednesday, we still hadn&#8217;t heard from them. By this time, my resolve was fading, and I was ready to bust a few heads. I called up their customer service department, and calmly explained that their idea of customer service was something akin to going to a restaurant and having to catch, clean, and cook your Catch-of-the-Day.<br />
I was told that I would be called back in &#8220;about 30 minutes&#8221;.<br />
The following morning, I made it painfully clear to Roger&#8217;s that I was not pleased. I was ready to cancel my cable outright. The poor guy who took my call was *very* apologetic, and then put me on hold for 45 minutes.<br />
[Ed. Note: Now that it&#8217;s a week later, this fiasco is getting kinda funny.]<br />
Here&#8217;s where it gets really stupid. I end up talking to the twit I&#8217;d talked to the day before. I choose not to mention that he&#8217;d told me that &#8220;at the very least&#8221;, he was supposed to call me back in &#8220;about 30 minutes&#8221;. Instead, he asks me if I&#8217;m at home. I say &#8220;no&#8221;, I&#8217;m at work. He asks me when I&#8217;ll be at home. I say &#8220;when I&#8217;m done, usually around 5:30-6:00pm PDT&#8221;. He says &#8220;Oh&#8221;.<br />
Oh. As in, &#8220;Oh boy, this guy&#8217;s about to kill me when I tell him we have to reschedule some time next century.&#8221;<br />
Luckily, Allison (who had only just started freelancing) *was* at home. I made mention of it. I was told that &#8220;she would be contacted today&#8221;. I quickly called Allison to confirm with her. She said it was &#8220;okay&#8221;. (Sorry, I&#8217;m getting a little &#8220;quote-happy&#8221;.) This was around 1:00pm or so. No-one called Allison until 5:30 or so.<br />
Yeah, really snappy service.<br />
At any rate, I come waltzing in around 6:30pm, with the PC tech practically on my heels. He then spends the next hour and a half tearing his fingers open on our computer (I&#8217;ve lost many a limb in that monstrosity). Several bandages and some swearing later, he&#8217;s got the thing responding to the modem, and we can surf the &#8216;net a lot faster than before.<br />
As we talked with the technician, he explained that Roger&#8217;s had literally just dumped SHL Systemhouse as their PC technicians, and picked up Microage. The transition hadn&#8217;t been really smooth. On Monday alone, they were to do 120 installs. There were only 19 successful ones.<br />
Guess who wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
In the end, things worked out *reasonably* well. We got the installation for free (a smart move on their part), and we got three free months of use (although that was part of the deal from the beginning anyway &#8212; either free installation or free usage). Aside from all the run-around, everything seems to be okay.<br />
At least for now&#8230; [Insert ominous-sounding music here.]</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Monday and Tuesday, I experienced my first real business trip. I probably would be more excited about it than I should be, but we went to Seattle. Whoopee.<br />
Going to Seattle for a business trip is like &#8230; well, imagine you could travel from Ottawa to Toronto in three hours on a six lane Interstate highway. (I would compare it to travelling from Toronto to Hamilton, but that&#8217;s not fair to Hamilton.)<br />
It didn&#8217;t get off to a great start, either. I had to go into the office on Sunday night to finish some work. Allison and I went to the Island Friday night to visit with her family (we hadn&#8217;t been over in a couple of months), so I had to leave work unfinished. This was work that I had to take with me to Seattle. It was kind of necessary that I get it done.<br />
We were attending Microsoft Meltdown, which is (for all intents and purposes) Microsoft&#8217;s support of the video game industry. Sure, there are companies there that have nothing to do with the industry, but they are few in number.<br />
What we did there was take two of the games we&#8217;re developing (our hockey and basketball games) and test them out on several video card manufacturer&#8217;s computers. It&#8217;s a good way of making sure that our games work properly on different computers, and the video card manufacturers can see what problems their games may have.<br />
Radical Entertainment has a tradition of always leaving a copy of our games with the manufacturers so they can continue testing at their leisure. That&#8217;s what I was doing Sunday night &#8212; making copies of the games. Sadly, my good friend Murphy decided to drop by that night, so a one hour job soon turned into a five-hour nightmare.<br />
(Just for reference, everything worked just fine, so it was worth the agony.)<br />
I got up a little too late Monday morning (hey, I&#8217;d only been asleep for about three and a half hours &#8212; I was tired), and was about two minutes late getting downstairs where Neall (one of my co-workers, and our driver to the conference) was waiting.<br />
We picked up Nigel (another co-worker) and Tim (my boss) at Radical, which was a relatively central pick-up location. We then pointed the car south, and headed towards the home of the Space Needle.<br />
Nigel opted to provide the music on our little trip. (Not that we really ever had time to pay attention to it &#8212; we spent almost the entire time talking. Natch &#8212; *they* spent almost the entire time talking &#8230; about cars. I know little by comparison, so opted to listen and be bored for most of the trip.) Referring to Nigel as a &#8220;Star Wars Fan&#8221; is like saying the Universe is big; he brought along the soundtracks to &#8220;A New Hope&#8221; (the real name for the original &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; movie), &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, &#8220;Return of the Jedi&#8221;, and &#8220;The Phantom Menace&#8221;. Not exactly what I&#8217;d consider road trip music.<br />
Seattle has bad traffic. KOMO 4 News even had a quasi-documentary on it a few months ago. On Monday morning, we figured out what the problem is: No-one wants to carpool.<br />
The I-5 north of Seattle has a carpool lane. Runs right to downtown (it turns into an express lane that literally fires you right through the middle of downtown). It was virtually empty. While the rest of the traffic came to virtual standstills, we were whipping along at 60mph without any worries at all.<br />
We quickly checked into the Sheraton Seattle and hauled our bags to our rooms. I bunked with Nigel, while Neall and Tim shared a room down the hall. My roll was &#8220;Swag Sherpa&#8221; (more on that in a moment), so I got to carry the bag full of CDs and other junk we would use throughout the course of the day.<br />
We signed ourselves into the conference, and took a chance to use our first three testing slots (we had to sign up to test our games, which is usually an ordeal &#8212; getting a chance to sign up early was a bug advantage). We had to wait until 10am to get the rest of the testing slots, so we opted to have breakfast instead.<br />
By the time we finished, the testing slots were open to a free-for-all. Luckily, the general population was still embedded inside the main conference hall, listening to a bunch of people listening to themselves talk. (Yeah, that&#8217;s about how interesting the seminars are.) We took the time to get the rest of our slots for Monday. (Tuesday&#8217;s slots wouldn&#8217;t open until lunch.)<br />
Unfortunately, none of the testing sessions started until after lunch. This meant we still had three hours to kill. So we did the only thing we could &#8230; we tortured ourselves with the seminars.<br />
So, imagine that you&#8217;re in a large room with about 400 people. The people giving the talks are boring, repetitive, and really not worth listening to. Imagine that you&#8217;ve had only three hours of sleep. Suddenly, passing out face first onto your conference notes doesn&#8217;t seem like such a bad idea.<br />
If only I had done that.<br />
Luckily, Neall, Nigel, and Tim decided that the speeches weren&#8217;t worth the air they were being broadcasted through, and we left.<br />
Lunch came not too long later. A fancy chicken breast sandwich with a small cheesecake for dessert. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder &#8212; most of the people here are techies, why on Earth would any of them really be interested in this kind of food. Where were the burgers? Where were the fries? At least they had a healthy stock of Coca-Cola and other similar beverages &#8212; it would have been a travesty, otherwise.<br />
Testing began at 1:30. This amounted to us going from room to room in the hotel, installing our games on vendor&#8217;s computers, testing them out, collecting t-shirts and other various things used to persuade us to develop on specific boards, uninstall the games, and proceed to the next room. All that ended at just after 5pm.<br />
Tim decided he would disappear to visit with family (his brother works for Boeing), while Neall, Nigel, and I opted to go see Star Wars (again).<br />
Before we headed out, I convinced them to go downstairs to the Product Showcase to see what was there. It&#8217;s a good thing, too &#8212; we saw a product we had never seen before, and wowed the three of us. 3D glasses.<br />
Yeah, okay, maybe 3D glasses ain&#8217;t exactly the bee&#8217;s knees, but when you consider that these glasses required no specific hardware, worked (theoretically) on any computer, and required no special programming in a game, we were suitably impressed. Not to mention playing &#8220;Star Wars: Rogue Squadron&#8221; in 3D was pretty slick. We would make a point of stopping by that company the following day.<br />
Dinner was programmer food: Hamburgers, Pogos, onion rings, pretzels, and pop. Basic junk. (It&#8217;s what gets a video game programmer through the day.) Then it was off to the movie theatre around the block.<br />
Star Wars wasn&#8217;t playing. (As it turned out, the theatres were *really* small, and the sound was pretty lousy.) However, &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; was. Neither Neall or Nigel had seen the movie, and while I had seen it twice, I didn&#8217;t mind seeing it again. Besides, I had nothing else better to do at the time.<br />
As we still had 40 minutes before the movie started, we hopped over to FAO Schwartz to check out their collection of Star Wars toys. (Still no luck in finding a Darth Maul action figure.)<br />
I will admit, I fully expected Neall and Nigel to not like &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. They hate everything. It&#8217;s their lot in life. They are, by far, the most cynical people I have ever met. It was a surprise to find out that they thought the movie &#8220;rocked&#8221;. In fact, they went so far as to say that &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; set a whole new standard for how much a movie can &#8220;rock&#8221;.<br />
Upon returning to the hotel, Nigel promptly went to bed. It was 9:30. I wasn&#8217;t even close to being tired. So I went back out. (I mistakenly thought that Neall went to bed as well, so didn&#8217;t bother to see what he was up to.) I wandered about the area around the hotel for a while, and then went for a walk.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before I stumbled across Seattle&#8217;s Monorail. It was the first (commercial) monorail built in the United States, constructed for the 1962 World Expo. It&#8217;s still running, and it looks 37 years old. It costs US$2.50 for a round-trip ticket from Westlake Centre (downtown) to Seattle Centre (where the Space Needles resides). The ride takes less than two minutes, and there are only two stations.<br />
Seattle Centre seems to be a bit of an amusement area. It has the Space Needle, the Pacific Science Centre, an IMAX theatre, a lot of amusement rides. From what I can tell, it&#8217;s what was left of the 1962 Expo. (Unlike Vancouver, which sold all the prime Expo land for a song, got nailed with the cleanup bill, and now have to pay exorbinant fees to buy an undersized condo there.)<br />
It took me about 10 minutes to realise that nothing was open, and I wasn&#8217;t about to fork out US$9 to go up the so-called Space Needle. I headed back to the hotel.<br />
We started off the next morning by taking our bags down to Neall&#8217;s car (so we didn&#8217;t have to lug them around all day) and proceeded to breakfast. Then it was off to more testing.<br />
Lunch was an adventure. Nigel sensed a disturbance in the Force (like I said, it would be like saying the Universe is big) &#8230; corn and salmon chowder. It was followed by a bizarre vegetable crepe-thing. I was beside myself &#8212; who in their right mind would feed video game developers this kinda junk?! I mean, really!<br />
After lunch, it was more testing. But we opted not to go the whole afternoon, and bailed after our 2:15 test slot. We wanted to escape Seattle traffic before it set in. We succeeded &#8230; only to land in Vancouver traffic. The latter is far worse.<br />
I arrived at home not long after 7pm, a bit tired, fairly hungry, and happy to be home. Hopefully, my next foray into the business trip world will be slightly more interesting&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, I did something a little different than usual. I went to Calgary.<br />
Alone.<br />
Well, not totally alone. I went to visit Stuart, who I had only seen for a whopping six hours at Christmas. Ideally, I would have also visited Therese, but she was off in Halifax on a conference, and visiting her sister. Also visiting that weekend was Jay, one of Stuart&#8217;s friends from college, whom I had come to know quite well.<br />
It was becoming the &#8220;Boy&#8217;s Weekend&#8221;.<br />
The original intention behind all this was to get together to work on a script that Stuart and Jay had been working on extensively, that I had started to contribute to a few months ago. The weekend happened to coincide with the release of Star Wars: Episode 1. Lucky us.<br />
When I arrived at Gate C34 at the airport, I noticed that there was a significantly larger number of people than there should be for a a flight not due to board for 40 minutes, let alone depart for an hour. It turned out that the flight before mine (also going to Calgary) was late.<br />
Quickly deducing that my flight would be late arriving in Calgary, I decided to try playing my cards. I walked up to the desk and asked one of the two attendants if the flight leaving was full. When she told me it wasn&#8217;t, I asked if it was possible to change my flight from the 19:40 flight to the 18:30 flight (it ended up being the 19:00 by the time it actually got going).<br />
A few minutes later, I was seated next to a window, waiting to get moving.<br />
Luckily for me, timing was everything that evening. Jay arrived a couple of hours ahead of me, so he and Stuart had gone out for dinner. Arriving early, I attempted to call Stuart&#8217;s thinking he might be there. He wasn&#8217;t. My next task was to have him paged.<br />
A moment after the page went out, I saw Jay and Stuart walking across the baggage claim floor. The weekend had begun.<br />
We retreated to Stuart&#8217;s apartment and watched &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, after engaging in a debate about where John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) appears in the movie. We were unsuccessful in our search. (Apparently he&#8217;s a Rebel &#8212; I mistakenly thought he was an Imperial.)<br />
The following morning, we headed out into the partially cloudy and somewhat rainy Calgary. Following breakfast at Denny&#8217;s (which left Jay and I feeling a bit odd for most of the day), we traipsed about the downtown before finally ending up at Eau Claire Market, where we indulged ourselves on video games. We were killing time. We were seeing Star Wars that night, so we couldn&#8217;t really go anywhere without coming back late.<br />
After a very small lunch, a couple of beers, and an IMAX movie later, we headed out towards the south end of Calgary. You really get an idea of how big Calgary actually is when you find it takes almost an hour to get from downtown to the south end. (Of course, we were driving through rush hour traffic, so that&#8217;s to be somewhat expected.)<br />
We were not alone in our vigil &#8212; several of Stuart and Therese&#8217;s friends were also attending the affair.<br />
We lined up just before 8pm in anticipation of the 10:10pm show. And just so you&#8217;re aware, there were others in the line before us &#8212; we weren&#8217;t the most desperate.<br />
The atmosphere once we got into the theatre was like waiting for a concert to start. Lots of talking and laughing &#8230; even a beach ball that was flung around the room (at least until the management took it away; we booed the usher for ruining our fun).<br />
It was an odd feeling, watching a new Star Wars movie. I couldn&#8217;t honestly tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen the original trilogy. We&#8217;ll just leave at &#8220;a lot&#8221;. We actually had to read the introductory text as it scrolled by. Our excitement was uncontrolled because, as Stuart put it, we didn&#8217;t know exactly what was going to happen in the next moment.<br />
A little over two hours later, we emerged from the theatre, mostly wired from some of the things we had seen. It was a good introduction to a long story (something that a lot of people were forgetting), with a lot of great action. We dreamed of many a lightsabre duel that night&#8230;<br />
The following morning, we decided we would head into the mountains. Jay had never been to the mountains, and wanted to see them up close. The weather was good, so we opted to take the day amongst the snowy caps of the Rockies.<br />
Before leaving Calgary, we picked up a friend of Jay&#8217;s who had moved to Calgary a year earlier, Kevin. Stuart knew Kevin through Jay, so I became the odd person out. Luckily, Kevin and I got along well, so it was a briefly-felt feeling.<br />
Following a quick lunch at Pete&#8217;s Drive-In, we hauled the hour and a half into the mountains. Jay (who had bought a camera that morning so he could take pictures) almost sounded like a little kid as he clicked away with his camera, recording the imagery for posterity.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Banff, although we were going first to Lake Lorna. Kevin quickly asked if any of us have been to Morraine Lake, to which the three of us all replied &#8220;no&#8221;. A third destination was added to the list.<br />
As we drove along, we discussed a great many things, including the things we would do once we finally got to Banff. We even discussed the pronounciation of Banff. Technically, it is &#8220;banff&#8221;. It quickly degraded to &#8220;bamf&#8221;. One of us saying &#8220;banff&#8221; or &#8220;bamf&#8221; was followed by three &#8220;bamf&#8221;s.<br />
Guys do weird things. Accept it.<br />
On the way to Morraine Lake, we noticed something. Snow. Yeah, I know, that sounds really dumb. But there was a lot more snow up there than we expected. This led to, of course, a snowball fight.<br />
It was short-lived (snowballs are really cold on unprotected hands).<br />
For those of you who don&#8217;t remember Morraine Lake (and yes, all you Canadians have seen it before), find an old CDN$20 bill. Flip it over. Voila! Morraine Lake. Didn&#8217;t even know it was that close to Lake Louise.<br />
The snow there was pretty deep, almost burying the sign that describes the significance of the area. Luckily, a lot of people had been there before us, so we could walk across the snow without falling in. This was a good thing for me, because in all my haste to pack for Calgary, I forgot to bring shoes. All I had were my sandals.<br />
Of course, this didn&#8217;t stop me from doing dumb things, like climbing the rock pile at the head of the lake with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. (Luckily, I have good sandals that grip almost anything, and the rocks were bare.)<br />
I was strange seeing Lake Louise again. The last time was a year and a half ago, when Gerry and I had stopped off on our way to Vancouver. Snow covered most of the mountains around the lake, and the lake itself still bore a sheet of ice. I felt sorry for Jay, not being able to witness the greeny-blue lake for himself.<br />
We wandered about the Chateau for a while, debated on crashing a wedding (again, it&#8217;s a guy thing; but don&#8217;t worry, we wouldn&#8217;t actually do such a thing &#8230; without good reason, that is), and eventually left for Banff (bamf).<br />
The townsite of Banff (bamf) hadn&#8217;t changed much in the year since I last visited (with Allison). After Stuart pulled into a well-hidden free parking spot (something that I wish I&#8217;d seen before), we proceeded to invade the downtown.<br />
It seems that Banff (bamf) was also invaded by a squadron of Air Cadets &#8212; they were everywhere. On every corner, and usually scattered about the middle of each block. It almost seemed Dickensian; I expected to see a military Fagin lurking around the corners.<br />
We wandered up Banff (bamf) Ave. towards the Park Administration building, then came down the other side. We stopped into various shops, but I abstained from buying anything &#8212; nothing there that really interested me. Jay and Kevin got sucked into a fudge shop where they indulged their sweet teeth. Tasty stuff, but it made my incisors vibrate.<br />
Finally, it was time for dinner (we really hadn&#8217;t eaten yet), so we headed towards St. James Gate, an Irish pub that Stuart recommended. As we headed over, we realised that we weren&#8217;t too far from Banff&#8217;s (bamf) movie theatre.<br />
It was playing Star Wars.<br />
They still had tickets.<br />
We figured popcorn would tie us over until we could get something else later.<br />
Emerging two hours later, hopped up on a heap of adrenaline from the lightsabre duels (yeah, we focused on that a lot), we went to dinner. A nice lamb stew and an Irish ale really hit the spot.<br />
After dinner, we ended up having to make a hard decision. Banff (bamf) is a great place to have fun. We thought we might stay the night, grab a hotel, and drive back in the morning. But then the little party-pooper in me thought about the plans for the next day &#8212; Drumheller. Driving from Banff (bamf) to Calgary and then to Drumheller wasn&#8217;t exactly something I wanted to do. It seemed it wasn&#8217;t something Stuart or Jay wanted to do either.<br />
The next time we&#8217;re in Banff (bamf), we&#8217;re spending the night, even if it means eight people crammed into a room.<br />
We arrived in Calgary an hour later, initially at a loss for something to do. We ended up downtown at a pub called &#8220;The Barley Mill&#8221;, where we swapped jokes, movie quotes, and work-related annoyances, quaffed a couple pints, and listened to some really great jazz.<br />
We got up a bit later the next morning, showered, hit Safeway to get hot dogs and buns, and headed out to Drumheller. I hadn&#8217;t been to Drumheller before, and really wanted to know what that area of Alberta was like. Jay hadn&#8217;t been there before either (he hadn&#8217;t been to Alberta before), and was excited about the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.<br />
It was a long drive. At least, it felt like a long drive. In reality, it probably wasn&#8217;t anything overly lengthy, but the heat and lack of features (it is the Prairies, after all) made it seem longer. Finally, the flatness gave way to an almost Grand Canyon-like valley (albeit significantly shallower), and the city of Drumheller.<br />
Drumheller is one of these strange cities that base their entire existence on one thing. Usually, that one thing is a resource (i.e. a mine). In this case, it&#8217;s dinosaurs. I&#8217;m really curious to know what would happen to Drumheller if the Tyrell had been built somewhere else.<br />
Our first stop was at McMullen Island, a small park where we had lunch. Then it was off to stare at Mr. T-Rex.<br />
I&#8217;ve been to a few museums now in Alberta, and I will say that they have some of the best ones I&#8217;ve ever been to. It&#8217;s really quite impressive. It&#8217;s not just a few piles of bones for you to stare at &#8212; they purposely lead you through exhibits leading to the rise of the dinosaur. Finally, by the time you reach the actual exhibits, you understand why the dinosaurs came to be.<br />
The museum works of the theory of evolution. You start with the single-celled organisms, progressing to the primitive ocean life. Then it&#8217;s on to the first plants on land, followed by the first land creatures. You start seeing the proto-dinosaurs, finally landing in a large room full of T-Rexes, triceratops, and Albertosauri.<br />
But the exhibits do not stop there &#8212; they continue on the evolution through the extinction of the dinosaur and rise of the mammal. They show you the birth of the sabre-toothed cats, the mammoths, and then take you to the ultimate mammal exhibit &#8230; the gift shop. Think about it &#8212; where else can you see the ultimate mammal in their natural environment?<br />
Returning to the outside, we wandered about the trails near the museum, looking at the rock strata that form the valley the museum sits in, the strata that contains the bones of dinosaurs appearing in the museum. Before hitting the trails, though, we endulged on some frozen treats to try and counteract the 30-someodd degree heat.<br />
A few times, as we walked about the rolling hills, we could hear good ol&#8217; Prairie Silence. For those of you who haven&#8217;t visited the Prairies and parked yourself in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the machines that make the noise we hear every day of our lives, you&#8217;ll never really know what it was like 100 years ago. The silence is truly deafening. (For reference, the only place I&#8217;ve ever been that was quieter was 150 feet below ground in a cave.)<br />
A short drive east from Drumheller took us to the Hoodoos. These are short clumps of rocks that have crowns. The crowns are make from less-soluable rock; they remain mostly untouched while the rocks beneath erode away. It makes for an interesting sight.<br />
Stuart, Jay, and I (mostly Jay and I) hiked to the top of the hill to see what we could see. There&#8217;s a lot out there.<br />
Another thing there was a lot of was sun &#8212; and I got a lot of it. Luckily, not so much to get a sun burn, but enough that my skin felt warm to the touch (even in the shade), and I really wished I had brought sun screen.<br />
Coming down the hill was a little harder than going up. Trying not to lose one&#8217;s footing when wearing sandals is a bit of a challenge, especially when the ground is crumbly. I slid a short distance down the slope, but quickly regained by footing.<br />
We stopped briefly at the Rosedale Suspension Bridge, put in place by the Star Mine company. The mines closed down in the 50&#8217;s, but the bridge continues to draw tourists. Rebuilt a few times since it&#8217;s original installation, the Suspension Bridge now features sturdy wooden towers and a steel grate floor.<br />
After stopping briefly to obtain liquid refreshment (we were quite thirsty by that point), we headed back towards Calgary. The drive back was surprisingly faster than the drive out, despite the fact that we ended up at the south end of the city, and had to travel for about 10 minutes along the Trans Canada to get back in.<br />
Stuart drove through the north of Calgary on our way back to his apartment, allowing me to see what the outskirts of the city look like. I cannot understand why anyone would want to live that far out. You might as well be living in High River for Airdale for all it really matters.<br />
We rented a movie (Rocketman &#8230; a surprisingly funny movie) and ordered Chinese. After the movie ended, we went out for a walk to a local sports bar, where we dove back into the movie script again.<br />
On the following morning, we headed out in search of Darth Maul action figures. Unfortunately, a few million people got there ahead of us. Both Toys &#8216;R Us and the Zellers we checked (not to mention the Bay) had their stocks depleted. Not a total surprise&#8230;<br />
Stuart took us downtown to his office, to show off his little piece of the advertising world. His company (Parallel) does some pretty amazing stuff &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s office is plastered with a lot of that amazing work. There are people whose abilities impress me &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s talent just plain frightens me.<br />
I remember his work when I was in high school. When I look back on his cartoony past and then look at the work he produces now, I admittedly get envious. He&#8217;s done very well on his skill, and it&#8217;s brought him many good things.<br />
We drove around Calgary for a little while, fairly aimlessly (we weren&#8217;t in any rush to go anywhere). We drove by Big Rock Brewery, for whom Stuart had done quite a bit of work. (Those of you in the Calgary area might see the billboards for &#8220;Kold&#8221; or the new Big Rock Brewery trucks with the beer bottles on the side &#8230; that&#8217;s Stuart&#8217;s handiwork.)<br />
At least some people get to see their work on public display. (For the record, Jay&#8217;s working on a kid&#8217;s cartoon show. He&#8217;ll get to see his work on TV.)<br />
As we began to drift in the direction of the airport, a sudden pang of guilt began to wash over me. In the hectic flow of the weekend, I had neglected to contact my relatives. As we were in the north-east anyway, I asked if we could quickly pop by my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home.<br />
I had been there twice before. I knew roughly where it was. But where I couldn&#8217;t remember the exact road to take us into their subdivision, Stuart did. He&#8217;d been there once.<br />
Stuart&#8217;s got a good road memory. (It also helps that he lives in the same city, and IKEA&#8217;s in the same area.)<br />
I got lucky, catching them after they had arrived home from camping. From Drumheller. The previous day. It&#8217;s truly a wonder that we didn&#8217;t run into each other over the course of the day.<br />
We talked for a while, while Jay put Maggie (my aunt and uncle&#8217;s dalmatian) into total submission. Jay&#8217;s got a way with dogs. Jennifer (my cousin) came tearing through the room at one point. She was about a foot taller than the last time I&#8217;d seen her, with shorter hair, and new braces. She smiled, said &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then tore back out of the room.<br />
<em>Sigh.</em> I remember being that age.<br />
Before long, we had to leave, and headed to the airport. Jay&#8217;s flight was before mine, and we didn&#8217;t want him to miss it. My flight wasn&#8217;t for an hour after his, so I would have time to kill.<br />
We bade Jay farewell as he disappeared behind the security wall and eventually onto Toronto. Stuart and I turned to dinner at the Harvey&#8217;s, before it was my turn to depart.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to friends, especially those that mean a lot in your life.<br />
Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see more of my friends this summer. Exactly when I&#8217;ll see them is a completely different issue. But with luck, it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s finally happened. I guess it was only a matter of time. Allison and I are going to prison.<br />
Specifically, the grounds of the former Oakalla Prison Farm, about a kilometre east of where we&#8217;re living now. We&#8217;re moving to a new apartment.<br />
This all started some time ago, when we came to the conclusion that our current apartment wasn&#8217;t quite living up to our needs &#8212; specifically, we desperately need a dishwasher, and would certainly find in-suite laundry useful.<br />
Our building has some quirks, namely all the services shut down at 10pm. This is a minor problem when you realise you&#8217;re out of clothes at 9:00 at night (yes, this has happened before).<br />
No, our kitchen does not shut down at 10pm, nor does the hot water shut off. However, we spend untold hours washing dishes. It&#8217;s become a nuisance in the grand scheme of wanting to go out and do things, not to mention the toll on my poor hands.<br />
It also doesn&#8217;t help that our dish rack began to fall apart last night.<br />
On Saturday morning, as we lazed about the apartment, Allison started perusing the classifieds (she will read most of the newspaper), and started reading off available apartments. I&#8217;ve been relatively content with the apartment, but Allison&#8217;s wanted something better for a while now. (Actually, that&#8217;s a really long story, which will eventually finish with us living on English Bay, but I&#8217;m not getting into that now.) I, of course, am always open to suggestions. (Hey, no snickering out there!)<br />
Allison&#8217;s pass through the paper led to a couple of possibilities, none of which were available for viewing. Giving it my best shot, I came across the entry: &#8220;Oaklands area. 6 appls, f/p, prkng&#8221;. Not a lot to go on, but I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot. We went over to take a look about an hour later.<br />
The Oakalla Prison Farm closed in 1990, after the site was deemed inappropriate for use (it was falling apart). The buildings were torn down in 1991, and the rest of the area left as a park. (Rather nice, isn&#8217;t it?) Polygon Homes bought the property and erected a rather large condominium complex.<br />
It&#8217;s a one-bedroom apartment that appears to have been bought by parents for their daughter. (That&#8217;s a guess, of course. We don&#8217;t actually know.) At any rate, the daughter was moving out, having bought her own place, and the parents wanted to rent.<br />
Allison&#8217;s eyes were immediately drawn to the moldings. She loves moldings. Sometimes, I think she just likes to say &#8220;moldings&#8221; &#8230; at least until we were in this apartment. Now I&#8217;m convinced she just wants moldings. I figure a few feet of nice moldings for her birthday will keep her happy.<br />
My mind was made up within a couple of minutes after entering the apartment. Allison&#8217;s mind was made up after she saw the laundry machine. We didn&#8217;t tell each other until we&#8217;d left the building and were preparing to leave.<br />
The layout was very well-designed: The kitchen was to the left of the door (no long, useless hallway in this unit), with a nice window into the living room. The living/dining room is a large space (the entire unit is 775 sq ft.) with a gas fireplace (the unit has radiant heat &#8212; a rather nice touch, if you ask me). To the right of the door is a short hallway, at the end of which is the laundry (to the right) and the bathroom (to the left). The bedroom is in the corner of the unit, next to the living room and bathroom. A walk-in closet should accomodate our clothes easily.<br />
And that&#8217;s just the apartment. Down the hall is a recreation room, including a universal gym. By comparison, our building has an exercise bike, treadmill, and stairmaster. We get two parking spots, full recycling (our building only has paper), storage and bike locker.<br />
The only thing our soon-to-be-apartment doesn&#8217;t have is a view. However, we can walk for one minute and get a view that&#8217;s much better than the one we currently have. Certainly no complains on my part&#8230;<br />
Well, maybe one small complaint. We had to make a trade-off in obtaining our new digs &#8212; convenience. Unlike our current apartment, the new pad isn&#8217;t really within walking distance of anything. It&#8217;s a very short drive, however, to all our favourite haunts. So it&#8217;s not really that big a deal. If we&#8217;re not pressed for time (which, realistically speaking, we won&#8217;t be now that we&#8217;ve got a dishwasher and laundry machine), we can still walk &#8212; it just takes longer.<br />
At any rate, we move on the 31st (hopefully the 30th, which is a Sunday) into our new place. The address is changing (I&#8217;ll send it along as soon as I remember what it is), but we&#8217;ll try to keep the phone number. No point in causing too much confusion.<br />
How long are we going to stay at our new place? Until we go to Europe, move downtown, or get bored of it and go somewhere else.<br />
Whichever comes first.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago, I made the decision to join the company softball team, the Rad Sox (Rad, as is &#8220;Radical&#8221;). This was for several reasons: I&#8217;d get out more, meet more people in the company that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have interaction with, hopefully improve my skills, and have fun.<br />
Two out of four ain&#8217;t so bad, I guess&#8230;<br />
We&#8217;ve played three games now, and we&#8217;ve lost each and every time &#8212; usually by a very unhealthy margin (our second game was something obscene, like 38 to 3). We practice a lot, usually without a lot of progress, it seems. Although my fielding is better, I still have problems.<br />
For example, on our Friday practice, I managed to somehow manage not to get my glove under the ball. So instead of the ball landing in my glove, it instead drove into the nail of my right big toe. Nearly bent the nail in half. Couldn&#8217;t walk very quickly for a couple of hours. Rather painful. Luckily, nothing was broken, and the bleeding was minimal.<br />
So let&#8217;s skip ahead to Monday night (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get back to the weekend in a minute). This was our third game, against some other company (we usually don&#8217;t know the names). I spent the first half of the game in the dugout (we have too many people for everyone to play the whole game). When my chance finally came up, I raced onto the field (mostly in an effort to warm up &#8212; it was very cold last night &#8230; did I mention that I&#8217;ve taken a strong dislike to the weather in this city?).<br />
I played third. First time that I was brought into the infield. Until then, I&#8217;d played the outfield &#8230; and sucked horribly. The coaches figured I needed the chance to suck on the infield. So I sat there, ready to play the role I was supposed to play. I made a catch, taking out a runner to third, and overall seemed to be doing pretty well.<br />
Until the next batter came up.<br />
She hit usually down the baseline, or bunted. Either way, Jon (the shortstop) suggested I play a bit closer to the baseline. Sure enough, next hit went straight towards me. It was an easy catch &#8212; the ball was rolling across the grass (albeit very quickly). I extended my glove, ready to snatch the rolling ball and throw it to first.<br />
The fields that we play on vary in quality. Some are pretty good. Some are really bad. And then there is Churchill (this is where we played last night). If you removed the grass, it would look a little like the surface of the moon.<br />
When the ball reached about two feet from my glove, it hit one of the many divots/dents/craters in the field and shot up at about a 45 degree angle. Although my brain could not tell my hand exactly where it was going to catch the ball, it did manage to tell my eyes to close and brace for impact.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how much inertia an ordinary softball travelling at 60km/h has. It&#8217;s also amazing how much abuse the human nose can take without breaking. But at least I stopped the ball.<br />
While I was reeling backward, trying to figure out whether or not I was upright or dead, the game continued until the ump had the notion to suspend play at one base (or something like that &#8212; you&#8217;ll forgive me if I didn&#8217;t pay a lot of attention to the game). I returned to the dugout to stop the bleeding (which didn&#8217;t take all that long, surprisingly). I stayed out for the rest of the game.<br />
So I&#8217;m now on partial DL until Wednesday, at which time I&#8217;ll figure out how I&#8217;m feeling. Hopefully, it&#8217;s not too bad&#8230;<br />
Anyway, back to Friday. Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, came out to visit for the weekend. Exact reasons, we didn&#8217;t know, only that she probably wanted to get away from home for a couple of days. I picked her up at the corner of Granville and W. Georgia, hopped a SkyTrain, and headed for the Old Spaghetti Factory in New Westminster.<br />
Allison appeared about a half hour after Jane and I got a seat, as the weekend traffic made getting across the bridge from Surrey rather difficult. We stuffed ourselves on OSF&#8217;s pasta and bread, all the while engaging in conversation.<br />
That evening, we took Jane to Playdium, to engage in some serious video-gaming. &gt;From 10pm until 4am, you can play as much as you like for $25. Yeah, it sounds expensive, but when you consider that most games cost $2 normally, it&#8217;s a really good deal. We played a good number of the games until about 1am, when we headed home exhausted.<br />
The next day, we drove down to Granville Island to spend an afternoon roaming around. After managing to find a parking spot (a bit of a feat, now that the traffic levels are beginning to skyrocket) we headed into the Island.<br />
Initially heading for food, we stopped to watch a busker. Allison and I had seen this act before, last summer. Joel from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (at which point everyone was instructed to say &#8220;Ooooooo&#8221;) was performing the trick made famous by Harry Houdini: Handcuffed, wrapped in chains, placed in a bag, and escape in under a minute. It&#8217;s actually a pretty simple trick, once you see how it&#8217;s done.<br />
I got abducted as his assistant. Oh yay.<br />
After he made a few cracks at my job (I never bothered to mention I work for a video game company &#8230; dopey me), I made an effort to cuff him very tightly. Further cracks wanted me to chain him as tightly as possible. I can only assume that&#8217;s why he does that. A poor girl from Delta (the equivalent of Brampton to Toronto) got suckered into checking his pockets for keys &#8230; something she really didn&#8217;t want to do.<br />
Needless to say, he escaped. In 57 seconds. He held out for three seconds to heighten the drama.<br />
Following lunch, we headed over to the Granville Island Brewery to have a tour, only we missed it by an hour. The next one was at 4:00. Back into the market to get dinner. We bought stuffed pork shops (which are *mighty* tasty, albeit huge), corn, and various vegetables for skewers.<br />
We missed the 4:00 tour because I couldn&#8217;t hold out any longer, and had to make a bathroom break. We took the opportunity, though, to get some beer and a bottle of wine.<br />
For my birthday, the Collins bought me a wine rack. Yes, a wine rack. It has a counter on top that we keep the microwave on. It&#8217;s very handy. Almost every time we go to Granville Island, we buy a bottle of wine. When we finally get the thing filled, we&#8217;ll actually start to drink it.<br />
We spend our time indoors, eating, drinking (beer and daiquiris) and watching &#8220;Home Fries&#8221;. Seriously messed up movie. Of course, it was written by Vince Gilligan, famous for writing seriously messed up X-Files episodes.<br />
Sunday was a weird day. Allison and I spend most of our time trying to kill time. After we sent Jane on her way, we needed to kill a few hours &#8212; we were going to a concert that night.<br />
I will admit that Alanis Morrisette doesn&#8217;t exactly rock my world &#8230; but she&#8217;s a pretty good performer, all things considered. She&#8217;s short (at least compared to the rest of her band) and quite energetic. Good live singing voice, too.<br />
The opening acts were Veda Hill (some local performer) and Sloan. Once again, Sloan&#8217;s bad luck with sound struck at them &#8212; the only reason I knew what song they were playing is because I could figure out the odd guitar chord and drum beat. It wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;Money City Maniacs&#8221;, their last song in the set, that the sound was reasonable. After Sloan&#8217;s set, Chris Murphy took a seat in the audience a couple rows behind us, just outside of arms&#8217; reach.<br />
The sound, of course, was tuned to Alanis. Despite the fact that she was over a half hour late hitting the stage, she put on a pretty good show. She did a very interesting rendition of &#8220;You Outta Know&#8221; &#8212; the music was extremely tame (no harsh guitars or heavy drums) for the first two verses. It really showcased the anger that the lyrics exude. Her encore I predicted about halfway through the show: &#8220;Thank You&#8221; and &#8220;Ironic&#8221;. But she didn&#8217;t end there, playing two more songs before coming back with an acoustical set. Quite impressive. She even let her pianist go nuts for a few minutes, showcasing some of the most amazing jazz-influenced talent I&#8217;ve ever heard.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a good weekend. Now if we can just warm this corner of the country up a bit, it&#8217;ll actually get liveable around here.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;The goats have been sucked.&#8221;<br />
That was how the Rad Sox season wound up Saturday afternoon. We started off the season with a fairly inspirational rallying cry before each game. However, as our less-than-stellar season progressed, the cry degraded to: &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221;<br />
Why goats? Dunno. It was Amy&#8217;s idea. We found it funny, and it put our games into perspective &#8212; don&#8217;t take it seriously. This was a good thing, considering how bad we usually lose. In our entire season, playoff games included, we stand at 24 games played, and only two wins.<br />
Yes, two.<br />
Why? Well, we were playing in a league with people who were (approximately) our age, unlike the &#8220;Old Sweaty Fat Guys&#8221; league the Sox were in last year. This, naturally, made them better than those in the &#8220;OSFG&#8221; league. We also had a problem of getting our key team members (i.e. the good players) to show up on a regular basis. This is partly the reason we lost all three of our games on Saturday.<br />
Triple headers hurt. Especially if they start at 8:00am. I pulled myself out from under the sheets at 7:07am, and managed to trudge my way into some clothes and get down to the car. Because we had to be at our field at 7:40 (so dictated by our coaches), I wanted to give myself a fair bit of leeway. It took (usually) 30 minutes to drive from Metrotown to Kerrisdale (where Allison used to live), so I figured on about 20 minutes.<br />
Even with a stop at Country Style to grab a dozen doughnuts, I still arrived 10 minutes early. No-one else showed until about 10 minutes later, during which I began to wonder if I was on the correct field. (I was, of course.)<br />
Our first game was against our arch-rivals, the Bladerunners. We don&#8217;t much like them. They&#8217;re really annoying. Their coach uses a kid&#8217;s toy megaphone. It&#8217;s annoying. Their first baseperson starts off every inning with a &#8220;Three up, three down, Bladerunners!&#8221; in a fake gravelly voice. She&#8217;s annoying. And although we creamed them 24-7 the last time we met, we lost by six runs. That was really annoying.<br />
Our game ended at 9:35, which meant we had just under four hours until our next game. It was time for breakfast. I headed downtown to meet the others for our morning meal. In the end, only Jonn and I ate, the others opting to work. (We&#8217;re on tight deadlines &#8212; two of our games are attempting to get out the door.)<br />
I returned to the office following breakfast to wait out the remaining hour or so by playing video games. Not even through my first lap in &#8220;Need for Speed III&#8221;, my phone rang. Allison was looking for her parents.<br />
The Collins&#8217; were coming over for the weekend to go to the PNE &#8230; and watch the Rad Sox lose two softball games. They were supposed to call Allison when they got downtown, before boarding a bus to Oakridge Mall (which is close to the baseball diamonds we were playing at). Allison was concerned that they were lost (even though the Collins&#8217; had travelled through Europe all on their own), and she was going to go find them. Thinking this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea (the Collins were to call our apartment, so I wanted Allison to stay), I offered to go look.<br />
I cut my game short, hopped in my car, and headed out to Oakridge. I parked at the Safeway (the Collins were supposed to be waiting there), and walked inside. No sooner had I reached the entrance to Safeway inside the mall did my phone ring. In fact, I was holding it in my hand, and had already dialled the first four digits of my home phone number. It was Allison. The Collins had called. They were in the food court.<br />
I waited with the Collins while they ate lunch, but had to head out to the ball park before Allison arrived. Even then, Allison and her parents were virtually right behind me, arriving mere minutes after me.<br />
Our second game was up against the Paper Kings. We like them a lot better than the Bladerunners. Very nice people. We had to borrow a player from another team (one of the nice people from the Bladerunners) because we were short a woman &#8212; we have to have at least three on the field at any time. We played a very close game, ultimately losing by only a couple of runs. Barb (our borrowed player) was dying in the field towards the end, desperately in need of a toilet. No sooner was the last out called that she took off across the field towards the washrooms, somehow still managing to cross her legs at the same time.<br />
Our third game was against the Tubeworms. They&#8217;re competitive. Not as bad as #69 on the Rippers (who would win the coveted &#8220;Jerk of the Year&#8221; award, if we had one in our league), but they just creamed us. Well, at least as much as a maximum of 10 runs can be considered a creaming. (League rules have a 10 run lead maximum during playoffs. There are a lot of weird rules in our league.)<br />
We sucked goats. Our last game was the worst of the three. Probably because we were exhausted &#8212; physically, and emotionally. You can only take a beating for so long before you become really frustrated. I know I was frustrated &#8212; my last up to bat of the year was a pop-fly after two horrible fouls. It put me in a pretty rough mood for the rest of the day.<br />
The next day was our trip to the PNE. We wanted to be there for the opening of the gates at 10:30 so we could quickly get into the PNE prize home. Every year since 1934 (not including the war years, when the PNE was used as a training camp and Japanese-Canadian internment centre), the PNE has offered a prize home. This year&#8217;s home is the largest ever offered: 4,189 square feet. It&#8217;s freaking huge. And frankly, not all that exciting. I&#8217;ve seen better. Like last year&#8217;s home. But it had a few design features we took away for use at a later date.<br />
We ventured through the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building, where you can literally buy nearly anything you&#8217;ve seen advertised on TV. It&#8217;s usually packed full of people and really annoying demonstrations offered by people wearing hands-free microphones with solid understanding of the human need to buy useless junk. Okay, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there are useful things in there, but you have to look for them. Like the fudge.<br />
We wandered around a bit, eventually finding ourselves at the Pig Races. We couldn&#8217;t actually see them, however, as there was a tremendous wall of people surrounding the spectacle. We continued on to the Petting Zoo. Mr. Collins looked like a little kid as he got in line.<br />
The Zoo is small &#8212; a gazebo about 30 feet across. Inside are chickens of various breeds, goats (old and young), sheep, donkeys, pigs, rabbits, chicks, ducklings, a couple of llamas, and lots of children. The animals are surprisingly content with people touching them all over.<br />
Following our visit with the kids, we took a short hike through Hastings Park. This is the fate of the PNE. Although the PNE has resided in its current location since 1910, the city of Vancouver is slowly converting it into an actual park. We saw Phase I for the first time this year &#8212; a second of ground that had been dug out for large ponds that had once been part of the midway. Over the next three years, most of the park will be torn up and replaced with trees and grass. The PNE&#8217;s days are numbered.<br />
You may be asking: &#8220;Why?&#8221; Simple answer: There&#8217;s no park on that side of town. More complicated reason: Although the PNE is the largest 4-H event in North America, it&#8217;s agricultural roots are beginning to die away &#8212; it&#8217;s really not the best place to hold these sorts of things anymore. There&#8217;s been talk for years of moving the agricultural events to Abbotsford, and the fair to Delta. At the moment, it&#8217;s only talk. The ultimate fate of the PNE is unknown, since no-one in government seems capable of making up their minds. It&#8217;s possible that in the struggle to sort all this out, the PNE might be brought to a final close.<br />
After lunch, we visited Hastings Racetrack, to watch the horses. I&#8217;d never been to horse racing before. I don&#8217;t have any great desire to go again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s (a little) fascinating to watch, but after two races, you get the general idea. Unless you&#8217;re into the betting aspect of it, there&#8217;s not much pull.<br />
It was then over to the Techni-Cal Superdogs show. We&#8217;d gone to the one last year, and thought it was pretty neat. This years show was, well, I leaned over to Allison just as the lights dimmed and muttered: &#8220;Let the cheese begin.&#8221;<br />
The show was held in the Pacific Coliseum, formerly home to the Vancouver Canucks. It was dubbed &#8220;Hollywoof&#8221;, and featured the &#8220;race to the moon&#8221; &#8212; a doggie obstacle course that pitted one side of the coliseum against the other. My frustration from the day before seeped back in as our side kept losing races.<br />
Sometimes, I think I&#8217;m not cut out for competition sports.<br />
The highlight of the show was a race between a 160-pound Rottweiler and a one-pound ball of fuzz, called Hiccup. The ball of fuzz won. The low point of the show was the introduction of the leader for the blue side (our side of the coliseum) &#8212; Captain Woof. He was described (rather accurately) by the leader of the red side as a &#8220;Village People reject&#8221;.<br />
Following the show, we went to see the Main Gate Theatre show. This was a production about the past 89 years of the PNE. It&#8217;s a musical, performed by four people (two men, two women) who appear to be theatre students. They&#8217;re pretty good actors, and decent singers. One of them looked a little like Gerry, but enough that I knew that it wasn&#8217;t him. Besides, I&#8217;ve heard Gerry sing&#8230; (Just kidding, Ger!)<br />
Then it was a race down to the Pig Races. Mr. Collins and I cut through a few hundred people and managed to save four seats on the bench to watch the races. The track is simplistic, a horseshoe-shaped track with a pool of water and a slide in the middle (this is for the duck races).<br />
Richard runs the thing. He started this many years ago, and spends most of the year touring with pigs and ducks. He told us that every May, he makes the trip from Woods Hole, Arkansas to Manitoba to collect four racing pigs. He then trains them (which he claims ain&#8217;t difficult) and takes them on tour.<br />
Pigs run pretty darn quickly. In fact, the actual race takes about 10 seconds. If that. So in order to make a show out of it, Richard also races ducks. They don&#8217;t race the same distance as the pigs &#8212; they go about a fourth of the distance, then up a ramp and down a slide into a pool of water.<br />
Then the pigs come out. Unlike the ducks, the pigs have names, such as Hammy Fay Bacon (Tammy Fay Bakker). Then the gate opens, they tear around the track, up a ramp at the other end, whip down the front of the cages to a dish containing exactly one mini-donut. That&#8217;s what the pigs race for. Frankly, I could understand that.<br />
I understood that so much that the first thing I did after the race was buy a bag of mini-donuts. They&#8217;re not quite as tasty as the Tiny Tom Donuts at the CNE, but they&#8217;re pretty darn close.<br />
After we pigged out on the mini-donuts, we headed out to get a hat. Bank 1, making a foray into the Canadian credit card market, was offering hats if you signed up for their card. This was when I temporarily lost the Collins&#8217;.<br />
I had to make use of the facilities. I raced in, telling the Collins they could keep going and I would catch up. When I came back out moments later, I couldn&#8217;t see them. So I raced into the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building to find them. I raced around for about ten minutes, somehow managing to miss two of them twice, before spotting Mr. Collins looking for me.<br />
Our PNE visit came to close. I was thankful for that &#8212; the lower half of my body was about ready to fall off. My legs were still reeling from the punishment I&#8217;d dealt them the day before. Allison&#8217;s feet were threatening to go on strike, so it was good timing on a whole.<br />
Undoubtedly, you may be wondering why it&#8217;s been a month since the last Observer&#8217;s Log. I&#8217;ve been busy. Really, really busy. With several major projects on the go at any one time, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of energy to whip one of these off. Not to mention that Allison and I have been laying low since the last weekend of July, to try and cope with the stress.<br />
However, it&#8217;s high time for an update, so I&#8217;m sending one out. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be a bit more frequent from now on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The shock came Thursday night, when I accidentally ran into the press conference while flipping channels &#8212; Gretzky was going to retire.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t help but think to myself: &#8220;Wow.&#8221; That was about all I could think of &#8212; this was a man who had been a name brand since I was seven years old. I remember reading my Owl Magazine in 1979, reading about some young hotshot about to enter the NHL, to play for some team in Edmonton.<br />
Two decades later, he left the NHL, taking his number with him &#8212; 99. Some say he was the greatest player who ever lived, some say he was the greatest player who will ever live. I say that when all&#8217;s said and done, Wayne Gretzky is The Great One.<br />
I watched the official announcement on Friday at work (we have TVs all over the hallways, which are regularly tuned to TSN or SportsNet &#8212; used to be ESPN, but we don&#8217;t like them anymore). We discussed amongst ourselves just what this announcement really meant to the world, and to each other.<br />
When Gretzky entered the league, it was a popular sport &#8212; mostly in Canada, and to a lesser degree, the States. Suddenly, this kid started tearing things apart. In a few short years, he brought the Oilers, previously thought of as some hick start-up, to victory in the Stanley Cup. Gretzky had made his mark &#8212; only he wouldn&#8217;t stop there.<br />
He kept going, and making marks wherever he stepped. The name Gretzky is synonymous with hockey &#8230; or perhaps, is hockey synonymous with Gretzky? Either way, both are changed for life. And Gretzky&#8217;s marks will probably never fade. The league is more likely to fade before The Great One&#8217;s legend.<br />
He is a legend, you know. His name is spoken in hushed tones when he enters a room. Kids (especially those playing hockey) are left wide-eyed and wide-mouthed should they ever see him in public. And with his seemingly doubtful return to hockey (or so says his father), his feats will be exaggerated, his skill embellished, and perhaps even his name dropped, until we know only of &#8220;The Great One&#8221;.<br />
In the meantime, the NHL is in trouble. Like when the NBA lost Jordon, the NHL is without the best ambassador it had for decades. There is no-one to pick up the torch. Sure, Jagr and Kariya have both been listed as the two most likely to become the &#8220;next&#8221; Great One, but they can never come close to being like Gretzky.<br />
Gretzky had presence. He had humility. He had patience. And above all else, he played for a team &#8230; not for himself. There is no-one playing hockey with those qualities. Perhaps in a few years, Gretzky may start coaching &#8212; maybe then he&#8217;ll train someone properly. But until then, the NHL will remain boxing on ice, with no-one to show what skill can do for the game.<br />
Saturday provided us relief from hockey, so that Allison and I could prepare ourselves for a later period in our lives. We babysitted (babysat? &#8212; aye, there&#8217;s the rub) for our friend, Kelly. And I mean baby &#8212; six months old.<br />
This we did as a favour, not because we really wanted to babysit &#8212; we had a lot of other things we needed to do that day. But in the end, it served as good practice for me. (Although, thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to change any diapers!)<br />
Gemma and mother appeared at about 1pm. After some quick instructions and presentation of Gemma&#8217;s things, Kelly quickly ducked out the door, and left her pride and joy in our capable hands.<br />
Okay, in *Allison&#8217;s* capable hands. Mine aren&#8217;t quite so capable.<br />
As was demonstrated when I decided it was time for Gemma&#8217;s lunch. You&#8217;d figure that somewhere along the line, instinct would lead you to want to eat. Through all my psychology courses, they told us about how repeated action leads to learning &#8212; you eat a few times, you&#8217;d think you&#8217;d remember how to eat. But no: &#8220;That spoon is a foreign object, and you gotta be kidding me if you think I&#8217;m gonna eat any of that Pablum, pal!&#8221;<br />
I got more of the Pablum on her face than in her mouth.<br />
After a little while, Gemma suddenly figured out I was giving her food. Suddenly, she couldn&#8217;t get enough. I was fighting for control of the spoon, holding the plate in place, and desperately trying to shovel as much Pablum and liquified squash as Gemma&#8217;d take. Then Allison took over for a while. After a few minutes, Gemma stopped eating.<br />
That afternoon, we realised why parents relish nap time &#8212; babies pass out, and stay that way for a few hours. We really noticed this when Gemma got up &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t too pleased about it.<br />
Kelly arrived just after 5:30 to remove Gemma from the premises, along with Allison&#8217;s old computer (having agreed to buy it).<br />
We were exhausted, and weren&#8217;t too keen on cleaning up so we could make dinner. So we went out to a nearby restaurant called (are you ready for this?) the &#8220;Seafood Shack&#8221;.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; sounds really classy, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
We didn&#8217;t know what we were getting into, but with an Entertainment Book coupon (allowing for a 2 for 1 special), we thought it was worth a try. We were quite pleasantly surprised: The decor was decent (furnished in late IKEA), the service was outstanding (except for how long it took to get the bill), and the food was &#8230; well, if you come to visit, we&#8217;ll take you there and let you judge for yourself.<br />
Allison dined on blackened Louisiana catfish on linguini, and having sampled a few pieces, I can safely say that it was very tasty. I opted for the Seafood Risotto. This was a wonderful melange of clams and mussels (both in the shell), with scallops, shrimp, and a thick, flavourful tomato sauce. The presentation of both dishes was exquisite.<br />
Sunday brought the day that most Canadians wish didn&#8217;t have to come &#8212; Wayne Gretzky&#8217;s last game. And for the blasphemy of all blasphemies, we didn&#8217;t watch the game. We had a good reason, though &#8212; we had to do all the errands we couldn&#8217;t do the day before (on account of having a baby temporarily disrupt our lives). But fear not &#8212; we did watch until the first commercial in the first period.<br />
And for the record, I would like to state that I accurately predicted the NHL&#8217;s decision to unilaterally retire the number &#8217;99&#8217; from all teams. It actually brought a tear to my eye.<br />
Gretzky is gone, and hockey will never be the same. I have found that I do want children, but not for a few years. I will now eat a lot more seafood than I would normally admit to. Maybe next time, I&#8217;ll be the one to change the diaper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our long weekend started Thursday night, when Allison&#8217;s company decided to hold an employee appreciation event at Metropolis (an entertainment-centric mall a couple of blocks from our apartment). Interlogic was springing for two hours of video games at Sega Playdium, and then dinner at the Rainforest Cafe.<br />
We didn&#8217;t find out about these plans until Wednesday night, so I was unable to make the video games (already having made plans to the &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; with some of my co-workers). However, I made an effort to drop by for dinner.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d met Allison&#8217;s new co-workers, and most of them seemed very nice. Claire, in particular, was extremely cordial &#8212; but since she&#8217;s the HR manager, I guess that&#8217;s to be expected.<br />
When we returned home, we made our final decision to go to Victoria for the weekend. We had tentative plans for some time, but we based our final decision to go on the fact that Allison&#8217;s grandmother was in the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria. Her grandmother had been the focal point of the Collins/Vailmont Easter for about 30 years, and it just seemed wrong not to come over and cheer her up.<br />
(As you may recall, we were in Nanaimo last Easter, engaged in Easter egg hunts in the grandparent&#8217;s yard. This would be the first year in about three decades where the hunt would not happen.)<br />
Early Friday morning, we hauled ourselves out of bed, and hit the road to Tsawwassen. Because of the Easter weekend, BC Ferries were running trips every hour, instead of every two hours, which was the norm. This was good for us, since we didn&#8217;t need to worry about missing a sailing &#8230; which we did.<br />
Arriving about ten minutes too late to make the 10:00 sailing, we parked the car and opted for a late breakfast &#8212; pizza. But this was no ordinary pizza, it was *breakfast* pizza: Eggs, onions, ham, green peppers, cheese, but no tomato sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, and fairly expensive. If they made announcements, it would go something like this:<br />
&#8220;Your attention, please. BC Ferries is happy to charge you exceedingly high prices for low-quality food that you will buy because you are hungry from trying to get here on time not to miss a sailing, or your children are begging you into submission&#8230;&#8221;<br />
We made the 11:00 sailing with no trouble.<br />
We sailed across on the Spirit of British Columbia, the largest short-distance ferry in the fleet (another larger ferry carts passengers up the coast, which is an overnight trip). It&#8217;s a massive vessel, about the size of a small cruise ship. It makes the trip fairly enjoyable &#8230; at least if you don&#8217;t suffer from motion sickness.<br />
Procuring a seat in the corner of the cafeteria, I ran cover by buying some snack food while Allison worked. BC Ferries doesn&#8217;t take kindly to people sucking up table space, so I made an effort to make them think we were eating &#8230; just really really slowly.<br />
Arriving in Victoria, we found it was raining. We had hoped that the weather would be nice for a change, but the generally poor weather was following us around. And no, before you think it, one does not get used to continually bad weather; one gets increasingly irritable.<br />
After a short drive into Victoria, we headed over to the Royal Jubilee Hospital to check in with the family elders. After parking, we wandered inside, and attempted to find Allison&#8217;s parents. We knew they were there &#8212; Allison&#8217;s Aunt Robin drives a very recognisable car.<br />
Luckily for us, we ran into Robin on the second floor, while attempting to find the washroom. Allison&#8217;s grandmother was pleased to see us, as were her parents. We visited briefly as a pair, then ducked into the TV room.<br />
We stayed at the hospital until around 6:00 or so, at which time we headed over to Robin&#8217;s apartment for dinner.<br />
We slept on the floor that night, a probably-not-so-great idea. I woke with a stiffness bordering on rigor mortis, Allison not better off. But we grinned and bore it, and had a leisurely breakfast with Robin, Allison&#8217;s parents, and her grandfather.<br />
The morning was significantly brighter than the previous day, the sun having actually shone through for a change. After a quick visit to the hospital, we opted for a tour of Victoria. Okay, maybe not *really* a tour &#8212; we had been there before, after all &#8212; but it was a good excuse to go out.<br />
We drove downtown, parking on a side street near the Eaton Centre. We had only an hour (the parking meter went no further) to wander about. So we wandered &#8230; right into Roger&#8217;s Chocolates.<br />
Roger&#8217;s is a mainstay in parts of BC &#8212; it&#8217;s an old company, specialising in some very tasty treats. It&#8217;s like Laura Secord back east &#8230; only better. Our mission was to obtain Easter chocolates for the family &#8212; this was not going to be a typical Easter, so we thought it better that we make an effort to do something special.<br />
After our romp through the chocolate shop, we walked around the harbour area, wandering into The Empress hotel. We checked out the prices of the lunch menus, suffered sticker shock, and proceeded back outside again.<br />
After moving the car to a less time-dependent location (a very cheap parking garage), we hopped out to find some lunch. We headed into an Indian restaurant, and promptly started inquring about the soup of the day. That&#8217;s when we found out that there was no lunch special on weekends, which meant the prices more than doubled. We made a hasty exit and went into another Indian restaurant two doors down.<br />
Being a beautiful day, we spent a fair bit of time wandering along the walkway around the inner harbour. You could hear the mainstay bagpiper from across the harbour with no difficulty.<br />
Walking around towards the parliment buildings, we passed a congregation of people, surrounding a small brass band, and a boat covered with flowers. Our first impression was that someone was being married. It wasn&#8217;t until a while later that it occurred to us that it was actually a memorial service.<br />
The walkways were packed with people, all relishing in the bright sunshine. (It was so bright that I nearly got a sunburn!) But the temperature was still cool, so only the brave (or the stupid) wore shorts. And yes, I did have a pair with me &#8212; it was still too cool for my liking.<br />
Buskers were about, too. We saw one busker whose act we remembered from the year before. There were a few differences, which made the overall show pretty good, certainly worth the two dollars Allison gave the busker.<br />
On the way back to the car, we checked for the availability of a hotel &#8212; we weren&#8217;t too keen on staying on the floor for a second night. We found one hotel room left for $30, and promptly headed off before we lost it.<br />
The Friendship Inn has been in Victoria since the dawn of time, or sometime roughly near it. The buildings are old, the rooms musty, and the mattresses somewhat curved. But for $30, I wasn&#8217;t about to complain any. Well, maybe except for the people &#8220;living&#8221; next door. We didn&#8217;t leave our things, opting to bring them back with us.<br />
If you go just west of Victoria, you&#8217;ll run into Esquimalt. Dependng on who you ask, Esquimalt is either a scary, run-down, naval base-influenced town; or it&#8217;s a fairly nice little suburb. I personally vote for the latter. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; there are some seedy areas (but then, even Oakville has its seedy areas).<br />
We drove about, looking at the houses, even looking into an open house out of curiousity, just to see what was about. We drove up and down, back and forth, eventually finding ourselves back in Victoria again.<br />
So we drove up and down, back and forth, until we found ourselves driving along Dallas Road, heading into Oak Bay. We had driven along this route before the previous year, only it was Allison driving, and it was at night. It pretty much ended the same way, with us passing along the north side of UVic trying to find our way back into Victoria.<br />
We returned to the hospital towards dinnertime, to check on everyone milling around Allison&#8217;s grandmother. We were surprised to find Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister) in attendence, and we had to do a double take when we saw Brenna and Cameron (Allison&#8217;s cousins, who live in Parksville). They were on their way back to Nanaimo (and Parksville). We nearly passed each other in the hall.<br />
Dinner was at Robin&#8217;s again, only instead of the home-cooked meal we ate the night before, we had Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
As a child, I remember loving Kentucky Fried Chicken. Of course, as a child, I could eat whatever I wanted without any consequences. As an adult, I am convinced that KFC is evidence of Satan&#8217;s existence. Allison and I both regretted dinner&#8230;<br />
On the way back to our hotel that night, I noticed something a little strange &#8212; the car seemed to be a bit louder. In fact, it vibrated a bit more, too. In the back of my mind, I knew what the problem was. In the front of my mind, I was denying it with every ounce of my strength.<br />
The next morning, the truth finally decided it would not be contained. On the way out to have something to eat, the muffler broke loose. Well, partially loose &#8212; there was a large rubber bracket holding the muffer to the car. As Allison&#8217;s mother would point out later, every time my car and the island have anything to do with one another, I have problems with the car.<br />
Pulling off to the side, I whipped out my trusty bungee cord, and lashed the stupid muffler to the underside of the car. Ideally, I would&#8217;ve just taken the muffler off, but that rubber connector just taunted me.<br />
We headed back to Vancouver in early afternoon, realising that if we hurried, we could get to Granville Island before it closed. (It was this revelation that made Allison convinced that she couldn&#8217;t live anywhere outside of Vancouver &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t get to the Market whenever she wanted.)<br />
A good weekend. It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had a good weekend. I mean a weekend where we didn&#8217;t have to worry about being rained on. Believe me &#8212; that&#8217;s a long time.<br />
After a leisurely rising Saturday morning, I went out to get my muffler fixed. That was my first mistake &#8212; I found out that the entire exhaust system was about two minutes from giving out. $200 later, I was out getting my car washed. That was my second mistake &#8212; Allison wanted me home earlier than that to clean. As soon as I got in, we were running back out again.<br />
We were going to spend the afternoon at Granville Island (yes, we go there a lot) looking around the market and buying food for dinner. It was a good way to spend the afternoon.<br />
Sunday started off even more beautifully than Saturday. It was warm (we opened all the windows for the first time this year) and sunny &#8212; the day was just waiting to be enjoyed. So we spent an hour cleaning. Don&#8217;t laugh &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how good that made us feel.<br />
As we were working, Allison heard a news story on the TV, talking about how the Alberta Report (a group of ultra right-wing wackos from Alberta &#8212; although there are those who think that *anyone* from Alberta is an ultra right-wing wacko) was going to take their message to Toronto, which the Report viewed as where most of the evils in Canada came from.<br />
It was then that it suddenly hit me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t view Toronto (or Oakville, for that matter) as home. In fact, it seemed somewhat foreign to me. It was no longer a place that was comforting, familiar &#8212; it was very distant, cold, disparate from everything I could think of.<br />
It was with a great and sudden shock that I realised that I have become a BCer: I complain about the rain and the cold (despite the fact that it&#8217;s not that cold), I wear sandals as often as possible (I&#8217;m wearing them right now), I can&#8217;t stand the NDP government (but will probably vote for them because all the alternatives are far worse), and view the east as an entirely different place. Canada is certainly different when you&#8217;re not in the centre of the universe anymore&#8230;<br />
At any rate, after our quick spring clean, we jumped in the car, and ran out to enjoy the day. We ended the day with a quick pasta dish, which for some unknown reason, made the whole weekend complete.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend was a little strange &#8212; we received some very unusual weather.<br />
It all started Friday night. As we were walking around English Bay with our friend Tyler, returning from a wonderful Greek dinner, we noticed that the sky was dark &#8212; much darker than we were used to. As we gazed up into the sky, we noticed that not only was it dark, but the soft texture seemed to have disappeared. It was now just a stark blackness, save for tens of millions of tiny, shimmering specks. At first, we didn&#8217;t know what to make of it &#8212; had something gone wrong with the clouds? Why were they so black?<br />
Then came the uncomfortable truth &#8230; our comforting blanket of cloud-cover was gone. The bleakness of space could be seen &#8212; our protection from UFOs was nowhere to be found.<br />
We quickly ran indoors to protect ourselves from the open night.<br />
The following morning, we rose slowly, allowing ourselves to bask in the joy of the weekend dawn. Yet again, we were disturbed by a change in the norm &#8212; one of us had left the light on all night.<br />
As I fumbled about, trying to find out which light was still on, I had a sudden attack of fear &#8212; none of the lights were on; the mysterious light was coming from outside. With a shaking hand, I slowly parted the window, only to have my eye seared by a powerful light from the sky.<br />
I darted back into the room, jumping back into the safety of my bed, and pulling the pillow overtop of my face, resisting the urge to break into tears. I was terrified &#8212; the sky had caught fire, and we were all going to die.<br />
Allison asked me what was wrong, why was I shaking with terror? I told her about our imminent doom. She took it surprisingly well. She got out of bed, and peered out the window. I expected to hear a shriek that would wake the dead. Instead, my ears only met with a sigh. For a moment, I thought it was the sound of her last breath, having peered into the face of Death.<br />
But no &#8212; she breathed further! In fact, she threw the curtains open, allowing more of that curséd light to pour into the room, filling every crack, and even passing through the comfort of my pillow. A moment later, my comfort was ripped away as my love flung the sheets from the bed, exposing my poor body to that harsh brightness.<br />
&#8220;Why?&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;Why do you torture me so?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Because it is the dawn, and the spring is upon us!&#8221; she harkened, throwing open the window to the day.<br />
The room filled with an eerie warmth, which reminded me vaguely of springtime in Ontario. But no &#8212; it could not be &#8212; the sun did not shine in Vancouver, it was not meant to happen!<br />
But as I rose, holding my hands over my eyes, I could see that I was wrong &#8212; the sun had bled through the ever-thinning clouds. The sun, giver of life, and burner of skin. It had not given up on our poor, soggy souls! The sun was out, the birds were singing, it was a completely beautiful day!<br />
So we decided to go see a movie.<br />
(Hey, how much sun do you think we can take after four months of rain?)<br />
All kidding (and over-done prose) aside, it was a very unusual weekend. The sun was out, and a lot of the cold and wetness that has plagued us here for the past four months (at least temporarily) went away. Taking advantage of a nice day, we did opt to go see a movie.<br />
It was &#8220;Babe: Pig In The City&#8221;. I highly recommend it, along with it&#8217;s predecessor, &#8220;Babe&#8221;. Very good movies. The movie cost $1, which was the only real reason we went.<br />
To get there, we had a nice, long drive into Coquitlam. It was a beautiful day, with blue sky, white-capped mountains, and surprisingly little traffic (at least until we got to Coquitlam).<br />
The following day, we decided to do something even bolder &#8212; we went biking. Unfortunately, Sunday&#8217;s weather wasn&#8217;t quite as nice. It was a little cloudier, and a little cooler, but it was still much better than normal. Although I&#8217;m hesitant to say it, things are beginning to look a lot less like Christmas, and a lot more like Canada Day.<br />
Now if we can just do something about Eastern Canada&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s only so much rain you can take before you start to go a little strange in the head. It has rained here nearly every single day since 1 Nov 1998. We&#8217;ve had about 10-15 days in that stretch where it didn&#8217;t rain, and about five days where we actually saw that big bright yellow circle in the sky. And Heaven forbid we should think that the colour of sky is anything but grey!<br />
Thus, I need not explain why Allison and I wanted to see something different for a change.<br />
So we went to Seattle.<br />
Why Seattle? Simple &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t been there before. It would be a change of pace, and (hopefully) something out of the ordinary. After all, you can only stare at the 33 walls of your apartment for so long&#8230;<br />
We piled into the car bright and early Saturday morning, maps in hand, and headed for the border (with a brief pit stop at McDonald&#8217;s to ease the rumblings in our stomachs). The traffic at the border was a bit heavy, but neither of us were too upset. It took only a few minutes to traverse the border, convince the US Border Patrol we were harmless, and be on our way.<br />
The trip to Seattle is about three hours, depending on how bad the traffic in Seattle is. (And even on a weekend, it&#8217;s pretty bad.) The trip&#8217;s a little dull too &#8212; the terrain is pretty flat. The rain and fog obscured all the interesting things to look at, so we had to entertain ourselves in conversation.<br />
I regularly find it amazing that despite all the time Allison and I spend together, we can always find new things to talk about.<br />
When we arrived in Seattle, we arrived in Seattle traffic. I hadn&#8217;t seen traffic that heavy since I lived in Oakville and drove into Toronto. And this was a weekend! Rush hour must be a complete nightmare.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we spotted the Space Needle, and went about figuring out how to get off the I-5, and into the city. Luckily, Americans are fairly good at marking signs. We exited the I-5, and found our way to Mercer Drive. This cuts a somewhat quasi-diagonal path through the north-eastern end of town, taking you by the Expo &#8217;62 site (complete with that so-called &#8220;tower&#8221;, the Space Needle), and eventually putting you near the waterfront. Arriving on Elliott Street, we turned left and proceeded to attempt to find parking.<br />
Folks, if you decide to drive to Seattle, make sure you have small American bills when you arrive downtown. Parking there is expensive (often brutally so), and unless you have small American bills, you might find it very difficult to find a place to park. A lot of the lots require you to place a rolled up bill into a slot. Other take the bills and issue a ticket (and have major problems with CIBC VISA cards).<br />
After nearly an hour of trying, we eventually found a lot where we could park for US$8. We weren&#8217;t exactly ecstatic about the price, but we didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The immediate agenda after that was to find lunch.<br />
By the time we finished eating at a cheap (albeit not only in price, but also in quality) Chinese restaurant, we decided it was time to actually go see *something*. So we walked up a street, turned a few corners, and arrived at Pike&#8217;s Place Market. Or rather, the staircase going up.<br />
Seattle is quite hilly. It&#8217;s not as hilly as San Francisco, but it&#8217;s much hillier than Vancouver. There are several staircases running from the waterfront to the top of the hill. (I would learn later that there was a reason for all that.)<br />
Once we reached the top (a little winded from all the climbing), we headed into the market. Pike&#8217;s Place Market (also known as the &#8220;Public Market&#8221; if you see the huge neon signs) has been there for quite a long time. It has just about every imaginable shop, selling fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers (fresh and dried), home-made chilli, doughnuts, flying fish, stained glass &#8230;<br />
Flying fish? Oh yes, there are flying fish in Pike&#8217;s Place.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s a store called Pike Place Fish, and they have a rather interesting method of getting the fish from the ice-packed display to the packers behind the counter.<br />
They throw them.<br />
I kid you not. You&#8217;ll suddenly hear a loud: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; from a large guy dressed in orange hip waders, quickly followed by a chorus of people behind the counter, all shouting: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; (they do this for every order, fish or otherwise), followed by a real large chinook salmon, flying through the air, from the large guy dressed in orange hip waders to another person behind the counter.<br />
Needless to say, this attracts a lot of spectators, most of whom want to see the flying fish. Apparently, sales are more brisk during the summer. (Tourists are such gullible people.) You can check them out on the Internet, at <a href="http://www.fishthrowers.com/">http://www.fishthrowers.com</a>.<br />
After viewing the sailing salmon, we continued our way down the length of the market to see what objets d&#8217;art were available. Most of it was produce, which is not at all a bad thing &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing like smelling fresh vegetables and fruits and flowers.<br />
Towards the end of the market, we came across a table where a man was selling home-made stained glass kaleidoscopes. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have stopped were it not for the fact that a neighbour of my family in Oakville makes almost the same thing. The design of the simpler kaleidoscopes was almost exactly the same, and the more complicated ones were very similar. (My family&#8217;s neighbour is one up on this man, though &#8212; he makes a binocular kaleidoscope that is just a wonder to see.)<br />
I made some quick inquiries. The cheap triangular scopes were about US$30. The more complicated ones with dials and spinning vials of beaded glass were about US$50, and the really nice pieces were US$120 and up. My family&#8217;s neighbour could probably make a killing&#8230;<br />
Reaching the end of the market, we hopped across the street and entered the Mecca of the West Coast &#8212; the original Starbucks Coffee Shop. Founded in 1971, it&#8217;s served countless cups of caffeine to the masses, and marketed itself into world dominance.<br />
They screwed up our cups of hot chocolate. They forgot the whipped cream.<br />
After walking around a little and snapping a few pictures, Allison went to purchase a dried garlic and flower wreath for hanging on our kitchen wall. (We needed a little more decoration in there.) Not wanting to carry the fragile decoration with us for the rest of the day, I quickly ran it back to the car.<br />
Upon returning to Allison, we headed down 1st Street to Pioneer Square, the original centre of Seattle, and the location of Doc Maynard&#8217;s. We were in search of the Seattle Underground Tour.<br />
What&#8217;s underground Seattle? Rocks, mud, a few bodies, but mostly dirt. All except for a 22-block area in Pioneer Square, what was originally Seattle.<br />
As we would learn over the course of the tour, Seattle used to be built on mudflats. No problem with that, except that twice daily your house flooded. It got worse when they installed Crappers (toilets as they were known in the 1890s) &#8212; twice daily, toilets on the flats would explode, creating six-foot high geysers from the &#8216;loo. Not exactly the sort of thing you want.<br />
To solve a large number of problems, the citizens did the only thing they could &#8212; they burnt the city to the ground. Okay, they didn&#8217;t actually do that on purpose, it kind of happened when a glue jar caught fire. It fell onto a turpentine-soaked floor. Of a shop built mostly of wood. The next door neighbour was a warehouse &#8230; filled with whiskey. I think you get the idea&#8230;<br />
The first ordinance passed required that all buildings be made from 60% non-flammable materials. Luckily for the town, the mayor owned the local brick works.<br />
One of the next things they did was plan to raise the roads. Chuckholes (essentially a killer pothole) were becoming so bad, the only way to solve the problem was to literally cover the roads &#8230; with upwards of 32 feet of soil. So they began to solve the problem, by raising all the buildings, then raising the road, then building the sidewalks.<br />
Sound a little weird? Well, that&#8217;s how Seattle got its underground. When the roads were raised, there were huge gaps between the road and the buildings. When those gaps were eventually covered with a sidewalk, the areas underground were abandoned. That was 1907. It wasn&#8217;t until the 1960&#8217;s, when local historian Bill Speidel opened the underground for a tour. Because of his efforts, the Underground (and the surrounding area) is now a protected historical area.<br />
At least, as much as Americans will actually protect that kind of thing &#8230; especially when there&#8217;s a profit to be made by paving over paradise, and putting up a parking lot.<br />
The tour was pretty cool &#8230; the tunnels aren&#8217;t heated. Sorry, cheap joke. We learned a lot about Seattle and its history, not to mention saw a lot of how Seattle was built one hundred years ago. It&#8217;s really fascinating &#8212; I recommend it to anyone going there.<br />
Following the tour, Allison and I went back to retrieve our car. Unlike all the other parking garages with reasonable hours (i.e. they never close), ours shut down at 20:00. Not exactly what I&#8217;d call convenient.<br />
After driving over half the city trying not to listen to Allison telling me the correct way out, we hopped back on the I-5 and headed towards home. We had thought about staying the night, but when you took into account that hotels cost about US$90 a night, we thought of all the other things we could do with that $90, and opted to go home.<br />
The following day, we rose a bit later than usual (we were a little tired from our journey), and started to plan out our day. We thought it might be interesting to go through Lynden, the Dairy Capital of Washington State.<br />
Why? Why not? (Also because we thought that the Tulip Festival might be on, although we couldn&#8217;t find any confirmation of that.)<br />
After looping through Lynden a few times, we came to the conclusion that the town was really boring (nearly everything was closed) and we opted to have a bite to eat, and leave.<br />
One note to travellers to Lynden: Don&#8217;t eat at Bob&#8217;s Burger and Brew (I swear I&#8217;m not making the name up). Just trust me on that.<br />
Just as we began to leave Lynden, the weather started to act strange &#8212; heavy rain, very dark clouds, hail, and thunderstorms. One of the things about BC weather &#8212; it&#8217;s usually pretty tame. This was way out of the ordinary, and it had me a little worried &#8212; it looked like tornado weather. (Although I&#8217;m told we can&#8217;t get tornados here, the weather patterns seemed just ripe for an ol&#8217; Kansas vacuum.)<br />
Returning to Canada again, we headed into Surrey to find an area called Cloverdale. Inside Cloverdale is a subdivision (whose name has totally escaped me) that has Victorian-style homes. This has, apparently, become a popular trend in homes. After a little driving around, we stumbled across the subdivision, and drove in.<br />
Very nice homes, and it really looked like a nice neighbourhood. It&#8217;s the sort of place I&#8217;d like to live. But the original subdivision was all sold about a year or two ago, so we couldn&#8217;t actually check any of the places out.<br />
Luckily, there was a new phase being built just next door. There were two show homes available for viewing. All I can say is &#8212; very impressive. Allison and I were thinking we could skip going to Europe, and we could get jobs in Surrey (well, *I* could get a job in Surrey), and we could buy.<br />
When reality finally sank back in, we acknowledged that while we&#8217;d love to live there, we had too many other things we wanted to do first, and Europe was one of them. It was by far the best designed house we&#8217;d seen to date, and it had a lot of design features that we wanted to include in ours. Maybe one day&#8230;<br />
At any rate, we&#8217;re back to working on our lives. Hopefully, our next big adventure won&#8217;t be far away!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is an auspicious date for me &#8212; one year ago today, I started my new job, working for a company that makes video games. A year later, I&#8217;m still here, despite the difficulties Radical went through in October and the layoffs that followed. Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that things have turned out they way they have.<br />
Speaking of new jobs, Allison has a new job as well. After countless (and some very strange) interviews, she started last Wednesday (10 February 1999) with InterLogic Engineering in Surrey as the Corporate Presence Guru. Okay, that&#8217;s not her *official* title, but I think that would be a good one.<br />
It was on her start day that I really began to hate snow. At least in Vancouver, that is. Well, actually, Vancouver itself isn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; it&#8217;s Burnaby, New Westminster, and Surrey I hate.<br />
Here&#8217;s what happened. It seems our old friend Murphy noticed that Allison was to start a new job, and Heaven forbid that she have an easy time of it. So he made it snow. A lot. We woke up that morning to a few inches of snow. That in itself wouldn&#8217;t be so bad &#8212; except that no-one here knows what to do with it. (And it doesn&#8217;t help that there&#8217;s no-one here who knows how to remove it.)<br />
Allison doesn&#8217;t like driving in the snow here, especially in her car (it&#8217;s a small Toyota). Considering all the morons in SUVs (sports utility vehicles) out here, it&#8217;s not unusual not to want to drive. Being the gentleman that I am (okay, you can all stop snickering now!), I offered to drive her to work.<br />
Normally, the trip is about 30 minutes. We left at about 7:40 so Allison could be at work for 8:30 (that her start time). By 8:00, we were just beginning to inch our way over the bridge into Surrey &#8230; and saw the line of 10,000 cars trying to climb a teeny-tiny little hill. Of course, the hill was covered in a nice sheet of ice.<br />
Realising that we weren&#8217;t going to get anywhere fast, I whipped out my trust map of the Lower Mainland, found a detour, and promptly ended up looking at another hill. Allison had always complained of how &#8220;flat&#8221; Surrey was &#8212; I was, not surprisingly, annoyed when she told me that there were hills in Surrey. The hills never seem to count when it&#8217;s dry and free of snow&#8230;<br />
Anyway, I turned around to go back to the 10,000 car pileup, and accidentally turned down the wrong road. This turned out to be a very fortuitous accident &#8212; it led us up a nice, relatively clear road, and got us around the lineups.<br />
Just after 9:15, we pulled into InterLogic&#8217;s parking lot, and Allison quickly headed inside. It was now my turn to go to work, and there was no way I was going to drive there. I left my car in the parking lot, hopped a taxi, and caught the SkyTrain. An hour later, I pulled into work.<br />
Again, I repeat &#8212; it sucks when it snows here.<br />
On the weekend, we travelled over to the Island to visit with family, most notably for Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s birthday. He turned the fresh young age of 80, and seemed quite happy to see his family all around him.<br />
For the event, we went to The Grotto, a restaurant that was noted for great food. This much was true &#8212; the food was pretty decent. The management, however, was the worst I have ever had the displeasure to experience. They didn&#8217;t seem to understand the concept of &#8220;customer satisfaction&#8221;.<br />
Allison&#8217;s aunt made a reservation at the restaurant a month or so in advance (it was, after all, the day before Valentine&#8217;s). She wanted to make sure that we would have seating for all 14 of us. Funny how they didn&#8217;t have 14 menus set aside&#8230;<br />
That was the first problem. It took 20 minutes to round up 14 menus. But it got worse. It took 30 minutes to get six appetizers. Six. Not 14, six. Something doesn&#8217;t add up there. Letting that slide, we had to wait another 30 minutes for our meals, and even then &#8212; we only got half of them. Moreover, the guest of honour (Grandpa Vailmont) was served last! Even a special order we had placed a day earlier (steamed vegetables for Grandma Vailmont) when unfulfilled. It took another 10 minutes to receive the last of the meals.<br />
Needless to say, there were several of us who were ticked off. Allison and I made a point of talking to the manager. The manager tried to claim that there were &#8220;too busy&#8221;, and deferred to whom we assume is her daughter (or possibly her granddaughter). Neither of them would apologise for the screw-ups, and in fact tried to blame the whole thing on us! How dare we bring so many people to their restaurant!<br />
Ten minutes later, Allison and I walked out with a $40 gift certificate, and a promise that we&#8217;d never go back &#8212; we never even got an apology. We didn&#8217;t want the gift certificate &#8212; we wanted to hear: &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry&#8221;.<br />
At lunch today, I met with my cousins, Pam and Darren. Darren works here in Vancouver, but tends to travel from Peru to the Arctic on a semi-regular basis (ah, the joys of being a globetrotting geologist). Pam works for Petro-Canada in Calgary, but had come out for a visit. We spent a rather long (and very pleasant) lunch at the Yaletown Brewery.<br />
That&#8217;s about all there is from this neck of the woods for now. The rain has stopped, but the winds are still blowing. (Lousy La Nina!) Hopefully spring will start soon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last night, Allison&#8217;s sister Jane returned from Europe (see [[Weekend in Calgary, Banff (Bamf!)]]), having spent the past seven and a half months in England (and Greater Europe). I remember being quite jealous at the time that she was going &#8212; she was doing what I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a few years.<br />
It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not going to be able to do in not too distant a time &#8212; once I&#8217;m married, I can&#8217;t go off for a year on my own. It&#8217;s making me really realise how much I liked being on my own while I was at university. Not having to answer to anyone (except professors, and later, my employers) was pretty handy.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Allison &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t give her up for all the tea in China. Hmm&#8230; bad analogy &#8212; I hate tea (except green tea, I love green tea &#8212; especially after a really nice batch of sushi, with tekka, maki, and maybe California &#8230; I&#8217;m not big on BC rolls yet &#8212; the salmon skin kinda turns me off from them). Oh, I&#8217;ve got a good analogy &#8212; I&#8217;d just as soon dump all my material possessions (i.e. the home theatre, the CDs, and my computers). Those of you who know me (i.e. if you&#8217;re reading this, you should know me, otherwise I don&#8217;t know what you received this) realise what that means, I hope.<br />
Okay, now that I&#8217;ve gone all gushy, time to get back on topic &#8230; whatever it was.<br />
Oh yeah &#8230; Jane returning home. So, Allison and I are standing in the airport, staring at the TV monitor trying to figure out which of the hundreds of people exiting the customs area is in fact her sister. Allison was asking *me*, who had only met her sister at most THREE times before, if it was her. (Of course, this was because I had a better view of the monitor.)<br />
The surprising part was that I did recognise her when she came out. Her white jacket was a bit grungier, her hair was different, and her eyes had the gleam of someone who had seen the world but not slept enough to look quite alert &#8212; but it was Jane, only now it was Jane, World Conqueror.<br />
I felt kinda weird. This was (at most) the fourth time I had seen my future sister-in-law. The last time had been in April of 1998. Since then, Allison and I had grown much closer, moved in with each other, travelled to Calgary, California, New York, and Toronto, gotten engaged, and started to plan a wedding. Jane&#8217;s (and Allison&#8217;s) parents know me quite well (to the point where they talk to me on the phone &#8212; not to be just polite, but they are genuinely interested &#8230; or at least they seem to be), and her brother Randy and I have conversations (albeit brief ones &#8212; Randy doesn&#8217;t really stop moving around for too long).<br />
Poor Jane &#8212; she had a near-total stranger lunge up and hug her as she arrived home.<br />
I made an effort to talk to her, but at the same time, I preferred that Allison do most of the talking &#8230; I figured that a voice Jane was familiar with would be more comforting. I feel like I know Jane fairly well, but that&#8217;s mostly because of Allison and her parents. In reality, I barely know her.<br />
I&#8217;m still finding it strange realising that there&#8217;s another family that I&#8217;m becoming a part of, where they acknowledge me as more than some guy Allison hangs around with. Oh well, I guess these are things I&#8217;m just going to have to get used to as life goes on. And what a life it&#8217;s turning out to be&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I found out this morning that I&#8217;m worth keeping. Needless to say, this is a big boost to not only my esteem, but also my ego.<br />
What&#8217;s all this stemming from? The Radical restructuring. Today will forever be known as &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221; within the walls here at Radical. Today will be an example of why we hate Disney.<br />
A couple of years ago, Radical negotiated a contract with ESPN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Broadcast Corporation, who happens to be owned by Disney. We were making (and were in the process of making) games for ESPN Digital Games &#8212; a venture between us and ESPN. We had three: Hockey, basketball, and a snowboarding game.<br />
A couple of weeks ago, we got the bad news &#8212; Disney said &#8220;no&#8221;. We weren&#8217;t allowed to try a publish them. TRY. It was like talking to Yoda: &#8220;Do or do not, there is no try.&#8221; Someone (dunno who) believed we were incapable. We had been gearing up for publishing for quite a while (which is why we have an office in San Francisco, and are technically an American company, so investors won&#8217;t be spooked). Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we aren&#8217;t doing jack with ESPN anymore.<br />
Unfortunately, ESPN was our major revenue stream. In other words, we&#8217;re screwed. And that&#8217;s what brought us to today. We&#8217;re closing the San Francisco office. We&#8217;ve released our CEO and CFO (much to the delight of everyone here). But we also had to release about 50 people here. That didn&#8217;t go over so well.<br />
We knew this was coming. We&#8217;ve known for a couple of weeks. It&#8217;s like walking on broken glass around here. You feel like there&#8217;s a sniper ready to take you out at a single command. Okay, *I* felt that way. Most of Pure3D is safe &#8212; they&#8217;re pretty bulletproof. Well, almost all of them.<br />
Greg James and Nenad Ukropina weren&#8217;t. I thought I was a goner, for sure. Resume ready to roll at a moment&#8217;s notice. Not that I wanted to leave, but I needed to be ready to bail if the plane started diving.<br />
Pure3D actually had private meetings to plan our escape, should things go really bad. Tim&#8217;s a Big Guy here &#8212; he knows almost everything. But even he sounded worried. (Either that, or he&#8217;s utter brilliant at getting us to think along safety lines.) We worked out a plan of attack &#8212; five of them, actually, Option A through Option E. These various plans went from things going according to plan, to Pure3D leaving as a team and going somewhere else (this was &#8220;Option D&#8221;, a running joke for several weeks before and after &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221;), to casting off to the four winds.<br />
This morning, we were all called to the lounge for a short meeting. It was a short meeting. It went kinda like this:<br />
Management: Good morning. We&#8217;ll keep this short. We have to release about 50 people so that we can keep the company afloat.<br />
Us: (To ourselves) Oh boy&#8230;<br />
Management: When you return to your desks, some of you will have email. If you do, please return here with your personal effects immediately.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: You will have to turn in your keys and anything else that belongs to Radical. You will then be escorted from the building.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: Thank you.<br />
You could have told us this would happen, and we wouldn&#8217;t have believed you. No way in a million years would we have guessed that this was how they were going to deal with the issue. It almost felt like Nazis had replaced our cool management team overnight with a bunch of assholes.<br />
Tim wasn&#8217;t in a good mood. I don&#8217;t blame him. He didn&#8217;t want to do what had to be done, and I know he didn&#8217;t like what had to be done. Radical did the only thing they could &#8212; remove the people before their anger did anything damaging. It was possible, though nothing seems to have happened &#8230; yet. The day&#8217;s long from over.<br />
Lunch will be an interesing one. I&#8217;m certain there will be talk. Mostly about Option D. We have no idea what&#8217;s going on, or what will happen in the coming days, let alone weeks and months. I think I&#8217;d better keep my parachute ready&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;d always thought that the &#8220;Welcome Wagon&#8221; was a euphemism for a group of well-natured people who would come to the door of folks new the the neighbourhood and welcome them into the community. Little did I know that Welcome Wagon is actually the name of a corporation that organises events and earns a profit (or so I assume &#8230; why else would a company have &#8220;Ltd.&#8221; as part of its name?).<br />
Welcome Wagon Ltd. organised a bridal show in Nanaimo on Sunday, and Allison&#8217;s mom thought it would be a good idea if we went over to see the show. Not so much to make arrangements (we&#8217;re still working on an actual date), but to get ideas for the ceremony and for the following reception.<br />
This meant we had to catch the 8:30 ferry from Horseshoe Bay, which meant we had to be up no later than 7:15. I crawled out of bed at 7:13. Allison followed at about 7:16. We were out of the apartment by 7:28, and the car had hit the road by 7:32. We arrived in Horseshoe Bay just after 8:00, where our next little fiasco took place &#8212; finding a place to park. This is the single hardest thing to do there, because parking is at an absolute minimum.<br />
The BC Ferries lot was full, that I expected. However, the nearby Impark yard was also full. I started to worry a little. But Allison knew of a lot over by the Boathouse. It was for Sewall&#8217;s Marina (it allowed no overnight parking as a result), but you could get a spot for the day, which it what we did. After I parked the car, I ran down to the machine to get a ticket. It was one of the older machines, which spat out a ticket at a time (for each $2.50 inserted). Ideally, it would do the same as the other machines I&#8217;ve used and let me pop in my VISA card.<br />
Nada.<br />
So I ran back to the car. I had made the mistake of wearing pants that morning, without dumping the financial contents of my shorts pocket first. (In other words, I had no change.) I got some change from Allison (which was a relief), bolted back down to the machine (the parking lot was on a hill), and tried to purchase three tickets. Except the stupid machine would only sell them using specific combinations of coins. I had only enough for two. So I had to run back up to the car, get another quarter, run back down to get a third ticket, and then run back up again. By this time, I was almost out of wind, and worried that if we didn&#8217;t hurry we&#8217;d miss the boat.<br />
Having not enough cash was a minor problem, so I ended up having to buy tickets with my VISA card. (At least that time it worked.) When we boarded the ship, we made a beeline for the cafeteria lineup. We were starving. BC Ferry food has a tremendous reputation for being horribly awful. We opted for the safest (and cheapest) thing on the menu that would see us through the day &#8212; a western croissant. The egg was at best egg-like, the croissant was like plastic &#8230; at least the hashbrowns were edible.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo just after 10:00, I came to notice something &#8230; my keys weren&#8217;t in my pocket. In fact, I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. Suddenly, I had a flash &#8212; in all that running back and forth to the machine, I had forgotten my car keys in my ignition. In my car. In Horseshoe Bay. On the other side of the Georgia Strait.<br />
I was suddenly not feeling so well. At some point, I need to sell my car. It&#8217;s costing me too much money to keep around, and if I can get a few thousand for it, then I can pay off most of my debt. But if someone stole it because I had mistakenly left my car keys in the ignition, then I would be severely screwed. Living away from home is sometimes not at all what it&#8217;s cracked up to be.<br />
Arriving at the Collins&#8217;, I made a hasty call to the West Vancouver Police, hoping that they might be able to do something &#8212; it would, after all, be crime prevention (not to mention idiot protection). But the constable I was speaking with suggested I call BCAA (the British Columbia Automobile Association). I thought it was a great idea. So I dialed the number, and explained it this way:<br />
BCAA: BCCA, how can I help you?<br />
Me: Hi! I did something really dumb &#8212; I just realised I locked my keys in the car.<br />
BCAA: No problem, we can get them out. Where&#8217;s your car?<br />
Me: Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.<br />
BCAA: Great! And are you with the car?<br />
Me: Well, there&#8217;s the problem.<br />
BCAA: Why?<br />
Me: I&#8217;m in Nanaimo. I just came in on the ferry.<br />
BCAA: And your keys are on the mainland&#8230;<br />
Me: Right.<br />
BCAA: Oh boy&#8230;<br />
There was the problem. BCAA required someone to be at the other end to hand the keys to (BCAA was not allowed to hang onto the keys). There&#8217;s a problem living here &#8212; I haven&#8217;t met many people, certainly a very small number whom I&#8217;d consider friends, and no-one I would consider good enough to drive all the way out to Horseshoe Bay to collect them. (Sometimes I really hate the fact that I left all my friends behind at home.) However, the BCAA operator thought that maybe the BCAA attendant could put the keys under the front seat. This was a great idea, in my opinion &#8212; Allison had a spare key we could get into the car with, and we&#8217;d be able to drive off with no problems. This was assuming, of course, that they could find my car. You see, I couldn&#8217;t tell them my license plate number &#8212; I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I knew my Ontario plate, but for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t remember my BC plate. So I had to give them a detailed description of the car. Luckily, there aren&#8217;t many cars in BC that look exactly like mine. That issue resolved, we sat down to eat before heading off to the bridal show.<br />
The show was at Beban Park, not far from the Collins&#8217;. Almost the entire show was arranged around the brides &#8212; there was almost no acknowledgement whatsoever of the fact that men even existed and were part of the process. Allison and I had a long discussion about this later on. It boils down to the wedding industry (and believe me, there is a very strong industry out there) brainwashing women to having extravagant weddings costing thousands of dollars. Allison had originally hoped to do the whole thing for $500. I knew that it would cost us about $2,000 and that&#8217;s about where we&#8217;re budgetting.<br />
We were there for research. Each table added another idea to the pot of things that we had to consider for our wedding. The biggest thing on my list was decoration. Although it is wonderful that we can get a hall in Nanaimo for a very low price (i.e. nothing), it&#8217;s not exactly the most attractive place. So I took the time to look at photographs and look at the displays to determine what we could do. That&#8217;s not to say that I wasn&#8217;t looking at anything else &#8212; I scribbled about three pages worth of notes, varying from wedding invitations to colour schemes.<br />
I was feeling horrible during most of the show. I&#8217;m convinced the eggs I ate on the ferry were making me feel ill. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling all that great either. And two fashion shows of women&#8217;s gowns was putting me out like a light. Even the overly-loud music wasn&#8217;t doing me any good.<br />
During the various raffles, Allison won a ring-bearer&#8217;s pillow. This little event changed our plans a little, and we thought we might end up using it. However, it would necessitate a few changes to our plans. At first, we thought having one of Allison&#8217;s little cousins would be a neat idea &#8230; then we scrapped it, remembering the financial input required for such a detail. The pillow would remain unused.<br />
I had thought that after the show, we&#8217;d head back to the ferry and we&#8217;d go home. But the Collins wanted to have dinner with us, especially since the Vailette&#8217;s (Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents) wanted to see us. (They had expected us the day before and had a small reception waiting for our arrival.) We dined on vegetarian lasagna (quite tasty, mushrooms aside), with a delightful cake for dessert. Allison and I had to then run for the ferry.<br />
Most of the way back, I kept hoping that my car would still be there when we arrived. I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to the prospect of having to deal with the police and ICBC to report a stolen car. As we entered the parking lot, I couldn&#8217;t see where my car was &#8212; a large white van blocked my view. But as I rounded the van, I was ecstatic to see my car in place. As expected, the keys were under the front seat.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you should get a BCAA membership &#8212; for those times when you&#8217;re hopelessly screwed, and you desperately need help. If you never use it, you might curse the expense &#8230; but the moment you need it, you&#8217;ll thank your lucky stars that you bought it. I consider mine well paid for.<br />
I grabbed my keys, popped them in the ignition, and &#8230; nothing happened. In all the running around, I had forgotten to also turn off my headlights. The battery was stone dead. Off I went again, running around to find someone with jumper cables or who could let me borrow their phone to raise BCAA again (the stupid 800 number doesn&#8217;t work in the lower mainland and I didn&#8217;t have a quarter to make the call).<br />
I lucked out with The Boathouse, a seafood restaurant at the foot of the parking lot. There I found a very kind waitress (originally from Saskatchewan) who offered to give us a boost. I was appreciative beyond words. A few minutes later, the car was running and we were on our way home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As some (or all) of you know, Allison and I got engaged during our trip to New York<!--(see Volume 6)-->. While we&#8217;ve told nearly everyone we know, we haven&#8217;t told everyone yet. More importantly, we haven&#8217;t set a date yet. There is a reason for this: Allison&#8217;s rather extensive family. In total, I have to deal with 19 people. That&#8217;s including my immediate family, my uncles, my aunts, and my cousins. Oh, and Nana, of course. Allison, on the other hand, has something on the order of 70 people in her family.<br />
We went out to Nanaimo for the weekend to visit with the Collins&#8217;, and so we could start working on the finer details of controlled mayhem. This included looking at several community halls, hotels, bed and breakfast inns, resorts, and so forth. We did find the places where we&#8217;ll most likely spend our honeymoon (we ain&#8217;t going to Hawaii, that&#8217;s for sure), but we had problems deciding where to hold everything.<br />
Our biggest problem, so we found out later, was food. We have about 130 people on a list (including significant others, if they exist). Even we if manage to whittle the cost of food down to a measly $10 a head, that still works out to $1300 in food alone. And then we&#8217;ve got the cost of the rentals, the clothes, the flowers (an extra, in my opinion, but apparently it&#8217;s unavoidable), the justice of the peace, bla bla bla. It&#8217;s going to be an expensive proposition.<br />
Upon our arrival, we went almost directly to the Wellington Community Hall. This building has been around for several decades, and has seen many events trapse through its rooms. Because Allison is part of the community, and her parents helped build and maintain the building, we stood a very good chance at getting the hall for nothing. And that would certainly help with the mounting costs of getting hitched.<br />
The next day, we looked through several different places to hold receptions, have people stay, and even hold the ceremony. (This was after we went to Costco to get Allison a membership and have lunch.) Most of the places we were interested in were up in Lantzville, Parksville, and Qualicum, all north of Nanaimo. Although all them were interesting, the single biggest problem I had was that for most (if not all) of my friends and relatives, these places were far out of their way unless they had a car. I knew that in nearly every case, cars would not really be an option.<br />
When we returned to Nanaimo, the Collins&#8217; took Allison and I to Fast Eddie&#8217;s for dinner. It&#8217;s a quasi-50&#8217;s diner-style restaurant. There we managed to totally stuff ourselves. It would probably be the last time I eat out for a while.<br />
That evening, we started solidifying a list of all the people we had to invite. It was then the distressing news of a huge food bill began to show up. Allison had been hoping to have the entire thing for only $500, something I had to admit I was a little surprised at. But she had been thinking very practically &#8212; a large pot-luck. Although I had no objection to that per se, I felt a little guilty because the burden would then be placed on her side of the family.<br />
This wedding is off to a slow start. We&#8217;ve got a lot of planning to do, and we have to start setting a date soon. And the number of people on the list will likely change a lot over the next few months. It&#8217;s too bad we couldn&#8217;t just run down to Las Vegas and get this all done with&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Summer has begun its slow end &#8212; the Pacific National Exhibition opened this weekend. I can only assume that its Toronto counterpart, the Canadian National Exhibition, also started this weekend. As back home in Ontario, the opening of the PNE is a reminder that the summer is much shorter than we all think.<br />
Allison and woke up Saturday morning, and decided that we would go to the opening day of the PNE. I had never been to the opening day of the Ex (CNE) in Toronto, let alone even been to the PNE, so I thought it would make for an interesting day.<br />
Following our brunch of breakfast burritos (scrambled eggs, black bean salsa, and some cheddar cheese wrapped up in a tortilla shell), we headed out for the Shopper&#8217;s Drug Mart. We understood we could buy passes there to the PNE. As it turned out we could only buy passes to Playland, which is the amusement park portion to the fair &#8212; and it was a lot more expensive than we thought.<br />
Nevertheless, we boarded the Skytrain to the 29th Avenue station, and took the PNE Express bus to the fair. When we got to the gate, we found that instead of buying the standard $6 ticket, we could buy a $15 dollar ticket that would get us into Cirque Parasol, a Cirque du Soliel rip-off. (There are a few of these roaming about, all trying to get their own pieces of the pie.) Thinking that this was a good idea, we put out the extra cash, and wandered in.<br />
Our first stop was the farm show, or more specifically, the farm animals. This is the last remaining part of the agricultural beginnings behind the PNE (the CNE in Toronto has a similar background). We viewed the endless lines of cows, goats, sheep, llamas (yes, llamas), chickens, and so forth. Unlike previous years (in Toronto, that is), this excursion began to bother me. I realised that all the animals in the barns were destined for a future in the slaughterhouse.<br />
Perhaps it&#8217;s conditioning from having lived here, and been exposed to a more left-wing environment (Ontarioans don&#8217;t think twice about things like this). But eating vast quantities of meat (particularly red meat) actually begin to make me feel a bit ill.<br />
Exiting the animal show, we began to wander about the fair grounds. Although we had bought tickets to Playland (the amusement park portion of the PNE), we opted not to go on it that day, preferring to look about the PNE itself. We caught a showing of Superdogs, a staged show put on by Technikal (a dog food manufacturer), which sends pooches of all sizes down a runway and over a wall (made of hollow plastic tubes, just in case the dog doesn&#8217;t make it). It&#8217;s the most popular thing to see at the PNE.<br />
After venturing around most of the PNE grounds, we went into the Dream Home. Every year, for about 80 years or so, the PNE has had a Dream Home contest. You buy tickets to attempt to win an amazing home, containing every luxury one can think of. This is the house I want. When we come back the next time, I intend to buy enough tickets to win it.<br />
Shortly thereafter, we had dinner at the smokiest place in the PNE &#8212; the barbecue chicken stand. A bad idea. Following dinner, we headed over to Cirque Parasol. It was an amazing show, considering we paid only $9 for it. It was hardly to the calibre of Cirque du Soleil (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]), but it was still pretty good.<br />
When we got out of the show, it was almost 9:30, and time for Chilliwack to play. Chilliwack is one of a hundred Canadian bands that probably never would have hit it big without the Canadian Content rule imposed by the CRTC. Without that rule, I never would have heard of Chilliwack, let alone remember over half the songs we heard. It was kinda eerie.<br />
Following the concert was a fireworks display. Compared to the Symphony of Fire, it was pathetic. But it was much longer than the Canada Day fireworks display. That was annoying. It wasn&#8217;t well organised, and it had no lead-up to the end before finishing by setting off every last firework they had. Following the works, it was time to go home and rest.<br />
The following morning, we had to go pick up my mother and grandmother (whom I refer to as Nana) from the airport. They were coming in to take a cruise out of Vancouver and up through Alaska. We rose a little later than I had hoped, and very hastily cleaned the apartment. Then we hauled out the door, and headed for Richmond. I figured we would be a little late. We more than likely saw mom&#8217;s plane land, followed shortly thereafter by Nana&#8217;s.<br />
When we arrived at the airport, they weren&#8217;t there. Allison and I hunted through the arrival lounge without being able to spot them. Of course, there was a reason for this. First of all, mom arrived through a different gate, and wound up in a different area to accept her luggage. Nana required assistance getting off the plane (she has had her hip and one of her knees replaced, so she doesn&#8217;t get around very easily anymore), and took a bit longer to arrive. Allison and I forgot to mention that we had been late in arriving&#8230;<br />
After picking up their luggage, we headed back to the car and out of the airport. We stopped in at the Milestone&#8217;s restaurant on No. 3 Road in Richmond for brunch/lunch/whatever. There we had a long talk about just about anything, but mostly how home was, how other relatives were, and so forth. Following lunch, it was time to show them where we lived.<br />
This was somewhat worrisome for me. You see, there is only one bed in the apartment. I hoped that Nana wouldn&#8217;t be offended or anything like that. Luckily, she wasn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
The conversation resumed, and we started discussing other matters. Then I found out, much to my horror, that my Uncle David had sold the cottage in Waskesiu. I was completely shocked and crestfallen. Although he did sell it to an old family friend that we could probably borrow it from, the luxury of just going was now gone. I felt like a part of my childhood had been ripped away. I had so looked forward to going back, but now that was a distant dream.<br />
Finally, we jumped back in the car and took them down to the Pan Pacific Hotel. We found out, much to our chagrin, that we could not yet check them into their room, because the room wasn&#8217;t ready yet. So we took a voucher for free drinks and sat in the lounge for a while, watching cruise ships depart and sail out of the harbour.<br />
When the room became available, we went upstairs and relaxed their for a while. It was a huge room, surpassing the size of our apartment. We watched a few more cruise ships exit the harbour (they all enter in the mornings) and listened to Enya on the in-suite stereo. After an hour or so, we opted for dinner.<br />
The in-house restaurants weren&#8217;t exactly cheap, but they weren&#8217;t over-priced either. Besides, neither Allison or I were paying. The conversation, as you can guess, continued. We talked all through dinner and dessert, until finally it was time to call it a night. Mom was three hours ahead of us, and exhausted. Nana wasn&#8217;t too far off from falling asleep either. We bid them a good night and a safe trip, and went home &#8230; after being robbed when we paid the unbelieveably high prices for the parking.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend just passsed was the BC Day long weekend (for those of you back in Ontario, that&#8217;s a fancy way of naming the Civic Holiday) &#8212; we get the first monday in August off to enjoy the weather and get out a little more than we usually do. We took the opportunity to visit my relatives in Kelowna.<br />
I dropped Allison at work on Friday morning, on the intention to pick her up Friday afternoon so we could leave Vancouver immediately. This didn&#8217;t work exactly to plan, because Allison ended up starving all day due to lack of money with which to buy lunch. We ended up postponing our departure until after we&#8217;d eaten.<br />
Then it was down Knight St. in Richmond to the 99 East, under the intention to cross the Annacis Island bridge, down to Highway 10, turning to Highway 1, finally ending at Route 1 (aka the Trans-Canada Highway). The only problem was that I missed the turn-off for the bridge, thus setting us back about 10 minutes. (And after all the problems I had with Los Angeles a week earlier, I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly good about it.)<br />
Route 1 was packed in a few places with morons slowing down traffic for no good reason (like there&#8217;s such a thing as a good reason), but soon we were whistling our way east. After an hour or so, Allison and I had to stop to make use of a washroom. Regretibly, there were no washrooms available &#8230; we had to make use of the local foliage to disguise ourselves.<br />
Climbing back into the car, I glanced at the fuel gauge &#8230; it was at less than 1/8 of a tank. I had left with over half a tank, thinking that it would be enough for the trip. I had never driven my car through the mountains before, and I was beginning to think that my car was going to be a little more trouble than I would have liked.<br />
By the time we arrived at the Coquihalla Toll booth, I was worried. My stomach was knotted, and I really didn&#8217;t want to hear what Allison would say if we had run out of gas. Fortunately, I do have BCAA (the BC version of AAA), but when you&#8217;re stuck in the middle of nowhere and your significant other is breathing fire, you really can&#8217;t defend yourself with a tiny piece of plastic.<br />
I asked the toll attendant where the nearest gas station was, foolishly assuming there would be one nearby. &#8220;Lessee, that would probably be Merritt, about 16 kilometres away.&#8221;  That is what I heard. This is not quite what she said. I figured out what she said a few minutes later, when I saw a sign that said: Merritt 62km.<br />
I about had a heart attack. Allison was going to kill me if I ran out of gas. For the next 45 minutes, I used every trick in the book to keep from running out of fuel: Travelling at 90km/h, shifting into neutral when going downhill (periodically running the risk of getting a speeding ticket at the same time), and not slamming my foot on the gas pedal. I breathed a very audible sigh of relief when we arrived in Merritt under our own power.<br />
Allison was annoyed that I hadn&#8217;t told her, but she was quick to point out that it was a no-win scenario for me &#8212; she would&#8217;ve been peeved no matter what had happened, so I got lucky in that she was only annoyed, and not ready to deprive me the ability to reproduce.<br />
After fuelling up, we stopped at the A&amp;W so we could get something to drink (we were thirsty) and so I could call Aunt Alaine and Uncle Dave and let them know we were running late. They didn&#8217;t seem too surprised, and I told them we&#8217;d be about an hour and a half late. They seemed to concur with that estimate.<br />
We arrived at their door about 23:30 that evening. Already in the driveway were Uncle Dave&#8217;s car complete with the boat on a trailer, and Uncle Mike&#8217;s truck with the camper trailer behind it. We squeezed into the last space remaining, and quietly got out.<br />
Our arrival was not unnoticed &#8212; Maggie, the Znack&#8217;s (Uncle Mike, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jennifer) dalmation, began a barking fit as I passed. This woke Uncle Mike, but not Jennifer (strangely enough). Brenda was somewhere in the house.<br />
The next day we started off with a big breakfast, and then opted for an excursion down to the launching ramp to put the boat in the water. When we arrived at the ramp, we found that most of the boating population of Kelowna had done the same. It turned out that the most popular place to view the Thunderboat races (which were the thing to see that weekend) was on the water.<br />
As we waited to launch the boat, Allison decided it was time for Jennifer and I to bond. She got Jennifer to tickle me. Yes, I&#8217;m ticklish. Jennifer loved it. Frankly, so did I, if for only one reason: I got to know Jennifer as a result. Jennifer was born in 1989, thus making her 17 years younger than myself. (This isn&#8217;t the fault of her parents, but considering Aunt Brenda is about 14 years younger than my mother, it does explain a few things.) Every time I had seen Jennifer before, she was either too shy, or I was too wrapped up with other things to really get to know her. I thought this was great, personally. I get along very well with all my cousins, so getting to know Jennifer better was a definite asset.<br />
Finally, we got to launch the boat. Not a huge event, but rather important before you can go out on the lake. It was then I found out that we were to go for a ride. This presented a problem &#8212; Allison doesn&#8217;t like small boats. She gets seasick rather easily. I offered to take the car back, which is the best thing we could do. I figured that even the trip back to the beach near the Tisdale&#8217;s (Uncle Dave and Aunt Alaine) would be troublesome for Allison, and I wasn&#8217;t really interested in pushing her luck. Dave handed me his keys and told me to take the car back.<br />
I thought to myself: &#8220;Well, at least now we can see how Geoff can drive with a trailer.&#8221; No problem, I thought. I can handle it. When we arrived at the car, we had a smaller problem &#8230; I noticed that where there should be a shifter for the automatic transmission, there was in fact a shifter for the manual transmission. I had never really driven with a manual before. I had always wanted to learn, but the opportunity had never really presented itself.<br />
Well, all things considered, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Yes, I did stall the car a couple of times when I tried to get going, but it was (so I found out later) because what I thought was first gear was actually third. (The shifter in Volvos apparently ain&#8217;t so great.) We managed to arrive back at the Tisdale&#8217;s in one piece, and with the transmission intact.<br />
There we found out that the rest of the troupe, save for Nana (my mother&#8217;s mother), had also gone out. The dictate was: Be at the launch for 14:00. Allison and I took the opportunity to get a few things that Allison needed. The first thing was contact lens cleaner, which apparently had emptied itself that morning. The second thing was Gravol. Allison was going to make an attempt to go boating.<br />
Despite the cola she had drank to counter the extreme drowsiness brought on by the Gravol, Allison had a hard time staying away. But finally, we got onto the boat, and took a trip out into the lake. Lake Okanagan is quite warm, and shallow in many places. But it is deep in others &#8212; the bridge crossing the narrow part of the lake is so deep that it wasn&#8217;t feasible to build concrete supports into the lakebed. As a result, the middle portion of the bridge floats.<br />
That evening, we had barbecued tiger prawns. I&#8217;ve become accustomed to eating prawns now, and can usually stomach them if there is no alternative. But don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ll still order something else if I have the option.<br />
The following day, Allison and I opted not to travel around Kelowna with my relatives, but instead decided to travel down to Penticton to visit with Allison&#8217;s friend Kelly (whom I knew). Although Kelly lived in the lower mainland (about 30-45 minutes from our apartment), bad timing had prevented us from all getting together for a long time.<br />
The plan was to travel down the canal that runs from Penticton a few miles south. You pay $10, they give you an innertube and they pick you up at the other end. However, there was a minor problem on this fine (and hot) day: The water level was too low. This meant we could only go half the length we could normally have gone. The three of us discussed this, then decided that this was not such a good idea. So we spent the afternoon at the beach instead.<br />
When Allison and I returned to Kelowna, we didn&#8217;t immediately return to the Tisdales. Instead, we went to check out a planned community called Kettle Valley. It was amazing. The houses looked just like the ones I had wanted to own for years. The prices weren&#8217;t all that bad, at least when compared to Vancouver.<br />
That evening, we had a vertible feast back at the Tisdale compound. Mike and Brenda had brought a rather large chunk of beef from Alberta, which was roasted to utter perfection on the barbecue. To match the meal, we had glasses of Okanagan valley wine, which had completely won over Uncle Dave (this is an important detail, because until that point he had only liked a specific brand of French wine). Dinner was fabulous.<br />
The following day was our departure. After another huge breakfast, we made a somewhat hasty exit &#8212; we were the first out of the driveway (the Znacks and Nana were also leaving), but I doubt we were the first out of Kelowna. Allison and I dawdled about Kettle Valley a bit longer, and then through the city, stopping briefly to pick up some aspirin to tackle Allison&#8217;s earache.<br />
By the time we arrived in Merritt, we were ready for lunch. We didn&#8217;t want to eat at a fast food restaurant, so we tried the ABC Country Restaurant (part of the ABC Family Restaurant chain). After a wait that even Godot would have been amazed at, we finally got our at-best-mediocre food.<br />
We effectively lost and hour and a half eating lunch. We were now at a disadvantage for arriving in the lower mainland ahead of the traffic. We hopped back on the Coquihalla, and I headed south, hoping to beat the pack.<br />
After a couple of hours, Allison needed to pull over for a while. She was on the sunny side of the car, and was beginning to develop heat stroke. At one of the places where the Coquihalla River passes under the highway that bears its name, we stopped for a rest. We climbed down to the river to play a while in its cool waters. There we wasted even more time building a small dam from the available rocks to create a wading pool.<br />
By the time we reached Hope, we had lost all hope of making it without the traffic. Allison was not in a good mood as a result of the heat, and I was getting a little annoyed myself. So we ended up leaving the Coquihalla and drove north on Highway 9 in search of Highway 7 (otherwise known as the Lougheed Highway), which would take us within spitting distance of our apartment.<br />
Allison was convinced this was not such a great idea, but I had a little more faith in the general stupidity of others. Aside from a backing up of traffic where Highway 7 and 9 met, the flow was smooth and non-stop right to Willingdon Rd., which we took south to get home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, for those of you who know me, is my birthday. For those of you who don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re excused. (Just keep in mind that you now know, and I expect to hear from you next year.)<br />
Today was also day from hell.<br />
Aside from the fact that it was uncharacteristically hot and muggy, it was also the second-to-last day to complete the work I had for the H-Spline group prior to their trip to Siggraph in Orlando. In other words, I hit the floor running at 07:05 this morning, and I haven&#8217;t stopped since. I am in a wee bit of pain, and I&#8217;m really tired.<br />
Upon getting to work, I quickly started writing the remaining parts of the documentation (beta release, we&#8217;re still a ways from finishing the thing) before I was brought before the Almighty Dave (Forsey, the brain behind the H-Splines). Then I shifted work to working on the copy for the Rodin (the name of our 3D Studio MAX plugin) brochure.<br />
Just before 16:00, I bolted out the front door, trying to get to the Skytrain as quickly as possible. Allison had told me not to be any later than 16:50, when she was going to pick me up. I don&#8217;t know what it was that she had in mind, but whatever it was, I expected it to be interesting, to say the least.<br />
I got home, doused myself with cold water (in a vain attempt to cool myself off enough to put on some nicer (and inherently warmer) clothes. I shaved, dressed, and bolted downstairs to meet Allison.<br />
Then she took me to North Vancouver, and still not telling me where we were going, pulled into the BC Rail passenger parking lot. This was my present. No, not the parking lot &#8230; and evening on the Pacific Starlight.<br />
Several years ago, BC Rail started purchasing vintage railcars (I think the most recently built car was from the 50&#8217;s), and overhauled them to function as dining cars. Then they pack a few hundred people on, and take you for a ride up the line to Porteau Cove. The train reverses direction, and goes back down the line.<br />
After a quick sprint to a Shell station to get some money, we boarded the train and took our seats. Allison impressed me highly by firmly believing that if your going to spend money, spend it well &#8212; she got the best seats on the train.<br />
The train departed from the station about 18:30, and slowly moved westward through BC Rail&#8217;s yard. Allison thought it a little strange that the yard was considered one of the features of the trip, but for rail buffs (such as I consider myself), this is as good a feature as any.<br />
We passed by the building that houses the Royal Hudson and the 3716, which are two steam engines BC Rail uses for hauling passengers and tourists to Squamish and back. It&#8217;s a trip I&#8217;d like to take some day. (I have a thing for steam trains, ever since riding my first as a little kid &#8230; the CN 6060, which ran between Toronto and Niagara Falls. It now rests at the Alberta Pioneer Railway in Edmonton.)<br />
We passed under the Lions Gate Bridge, and entered West Vancouver. Many people on the train probably thought it very strange that so many homes (especially expensive ones &#8212; West Vancouver is noted for its very high property prices) boardered on the rails. Apparently, when the PGR was bought up by BC Rail, they had let the line go into disrepair. During that time, many homeowners were told (usually by real estate agents) that they could use the land on the rails. In the mid-70&#8217;s, however, BC Rail employees came along and told them otherwise. Many were not pleased.<br />
Today, that&#8217;s an entirely different issue. The number of people who waved at us as we passed was very surprising &#8230; I had to actually wonder what these people did with their time &#8212; waiting for trains to pass by?<br />
We wound our way along the line towards Horseshoe Bay, moving at a relatively slow pace. There were three reasons for which I thought of for the slow speed, but only two seem really appropriate: reducing the motion of the cars so people could eat, and so people can see the view.<br />
And what a view. Wow. I mean that. Wow. It was amazing. It was such a relaxing trip, that I almost didn&#8217;t notice the lack of foot room under the table.<br />
We sat at a table with a slightly older couple, Ian and Yvonne, who were celebrating their first wedding anniversary together. We talked a little (mostly on the way back) about everything, including the trip Allison and I are going on tomorrow.<br />
The dinner was absolutely sumptuous. Allison had conned me earlier in the month into telling her what I would like to eat. In fact, the entire present was one big charade (I have to give Allison full credit for being completely devious), but I haven&#8217;t the least bit of a grudge for it. We both had a salmon dinner, which to date is the best fish I have ever had in my life.<br />
When we arrived at Porteau Cove, we found (much to our surprise) that the jazz band that had sent us off in North Vancouver had beaten us there (which in all reality wasn&#8217;t that hard &#8212; the train moved that slow) and was still playing when we arrived. Very classy, non?<br />
We had a 45 minute layover (for us to stretch our legs, and so the nicotine addicts could get their fix), so we wandered about a bit, looked at Porteau Cove Provincial Park (it&#8217;s a lot smaller than it sounds), and then wandered back to the train.<br />
The trip back has us facing backwards (passengers are guaranteed to face forward during one half of the trip), but it was no less spectacular. We had dessert, which was a chocolate mousse-like (albeit much denser) quasi-cake, the name of which I completely forget.<br />
Upon arrival back in North Vancouver, we returned to Allison&#8217;s car, and headed for home to finish packing and get ready to leave on our next great journey.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last Wednesday (1 July 1998), I celebrated my first Canada Day outside of Ontario. Until that day, I had always had the luxury of being in the same time zone (and twice being in the same city) as the National Canada Day celebration. I will say one thing &#8212; the celebrations out here just don&#8217;t come close to what Ottawa puts on show.<br />
Allison and I rose late that morning, opting to catch some extra sleep. We then tried to figure out what it was that we wanted to do. Both of us had the day off, but with nothing particular in mind, we decided for a three-fold attack: IKEA, Canada Place, and Granville Island.<br />
The first stop was IKEA, where we bought a few things that we needed around the house (a couple of picture frames, a second set of dishes, and a few kitchen utensils), and ate a quick lunch.<br />
Then it was off to Canada Place to find some Canada Day cheer and celebration. It didn&#8217;t take long to find it &#8212; our first indication was a formation of World War II fighters buzzing the Burrard Inlet, laying smoke trails with each pass.<br />
We walked right down to the hotel lobby, and wandered inside. While we were in there, we noticed a sign on the wall for the Canada Day celebrations. As tradition held, a large number of new immigrants were sworn in every July 1, and that day was no exception. Following the ceremony was a long list of performers. One in particular caught my eye&#8230;<br />
Lee Aaron.<br />
That&#8217;s right, Lee Aaron, Canada&#8217;s &#8220;Metal Queen&#8221; from the late 80&#8217;s. I hadn&#8217;t heard anything out of her in years, and I had periodically wondered what had happened to her (usually when listening to furnaceface&#8217;s &#8220;Ballad of Richard Iomi&#8221;). Allison and I thought we&#8217;d stop in and see if we recognised any of the songs she played.<br />
One thing that I noticed right away as being odd: Her band was introduced as the &#8220;Swinging Barflies&#8221;.<br />
It seems that Canada&#8217;s <em>former</em> &#8220;Metal Queen&#8221; now sings swing. It was, shall we say, a rather major change in her style. A rather discomforting change. We didn&#8217;t stay too long.<br />
We went outside and started wandering down the pier (Canada Place normally functions as a dock for cruise ships). Along the way, we looked at some of the little presentations that had been set up. Allison (and I) found it very annoying that there was almost no uniquely Canadian presentation. We found a Mexican marachi band (who were almost completely drowned out by the singing swarm of Latin Americans surrounding them), and a Carribbean steel-drum band. Several food stalls, almost none of which featured a &#8220;Canadian&#8221; dish.<br />
Aside from the RCMP demonstrations (nothing as fancy as the vaulted &#8220;Musical Ride&#8221;) and the infamous &#8220;Beaver Tails&#8221; (which, concidentally enough, the last time I had one was with Allison when we were in Ottawa four years ago), there was almost no Canadian identity floating around. It was a little annoying, but I reminded myself that Canada isn&#8217;t a melting pot, and we do our best to showcase each culture as best we can.<br />
I still would have liked to see something made from maple syrup though&#8230;<br />
Afterwards, we went down to Granville Island to get something for dinner. It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, but the traffic was still worse than usual. We didn&#8217;t stay long, just enough to buy some chicken, pork chops, and vegetables. Then it was off to home.<br />
As we were making dinner, we made plans to meet with Tyler, and Mike and Michelle downtown to see the fireworks that night. It was a simple little process that we would have to change a little as we went along.<br />
All the walking we had done that day had done a number on Allison&#8217;s feet, and she had a blister on her foot that could make most people break down in tears. So we ended up changing plans, and meeting the other three downtown.<br />
No sooner than we had run into the three of them than I noticed something missing &#8230; my car keys. They were still in the ignition in my car. I ended up having to jog back to my car (Mike came along for the fun of it, so it seemed) to retrieve them.<br />
The fireworks were nothing overly spectacular &#8212; the Symphony of Fire is much more impressive. But all things considered, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. On the way back towards our car, we ran into an old friend of Allison and Tylers &#8212; John Paul (known as JP). JP dragged the lot of us into the Hotel Vancouver for over-priced drinks. Allison and I didn&#8217;t get home until almost 02:00.<br />
Late on 980705, I passed an important mark in my new life &#8212; I have now been in British Columbia for six months. I can&#8217;t believe that so short a time has passed since my arrival &#8230; all the things that I&#8217;ve done, all the things I&#8217;ve seen, all the things I still want to do, and it&#8217;s only been six months.<br />
Of course, it&#8217;s been six months of me being without friends or family. It&#8217;s pretty rough at times. Allison&#8217;s the world to me, but even she can&#8217;t make up for my closest friends. There&#8217;s just something about the way people who know me. After the barbecue Allison and I went to on the weekend, though, things might change later in the future. But that&#8217;s yet to be seen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I severed the last vestages that tied me to my birthplace. This morning, I went to the local CAA chapter (known as BCAA), and turned in my car&#8217;s license plates. I thus separated myself from the suit-and-tie ideals of Toronto, and became fully enveloped by the sandal-wearing hedonism that thrive here on the west coast. I guess I am truly now a British Columbian.<br />
On the weekend, Allison&#8217;s parents came out to the Lower Mainland for Father&#8217;s Day. Originally, Allison and I were going to Vancouver, but Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well enough to travel, so her parents offered to come over.<br />
They came over Saturday morning, which was when we had decided we were going to make a couple of purchases. We got up early (for a Saturday morning after a Friday night where we stayed up late cleaning up) and headed to IKEA and Home Depot. The idea was to purchase a table and chair set (which IKEA sold for a surprisingly low $229) and a barbecue. We needed both, since we were currently using Allison&#8217;s card table for a dinner table (and while it was a nice card table, it wasn&#8217;t terribly strong), and, well, hey &#8212; everyone needs a barbecue!<br />
But it took us too long. I ended up having to drop off Allison at the Patterson SkyTrain station so she could meet her parents downtown, while I took our newly-gotten booty home and into our apartment, followed up by a very hasty shower and shave.<br />
I was five minutes late getting downtown, something I owed to the plethora of red lights I kept hitting on the way.<br />
We went to Granville Island, home of the freshest food available in the Lower Mainland. We bought all the food that would go into our dinner (after having a quick bite to eat), and returned to our apartment.<br />
I decided that it might be a good idea to put the table, chairs, and barbecue together, since I didn&#8217;t really feel like eating at 21:00. As I began to piece together the table, Allison&#8217;s father sat down next to me and began to help. At first I was about to shoo him away, telling him to spend time with his family, but I quickly realised that I was going to need some help.<br />
The table was a snap, we had it assembled in a few moments. The chairs took a bit longer (and it didn&#8217;t help any that I got two chairs assembled incorrectly), but soon were usable. The big problem was the barbecue. Bad instructions (Step #3 should have been explained before Step #1) led to a longer job. But soon it was perched on the balcony, awaiting a full gas tank to bring it to life.<br />
Having wasted most of an afternoon putting things together, I suggested that we go outside for some air. Allison suggested that we go to Burnaby Lake, which we hadn&#8217;t been to before.<br />
This was considerably harder than it sounds, especially when we didn&#8217;t know exactly where it was. (I know, I know &#8212; how to you not see a lake?) We ended up almost in Coquitlam before we realised that we&#8217;d missed it. So we broke out the map (which was in the trunk, which is why we didn&#8217;t look at it right away) and followed some rudamentary directions.<br />
It turns out that Burnaby Lake is a protected lake &#8212; no-one&#8217;s allowed to swim in it, and the only place you can really get near the lake is at the rowing course that was built a few decades ago. It was the first time that I had seen lilypads in more years than I could possibly remember, let alone count. It&#8217;s about a kilometre long and about 300 metres wide, and ringed completely with marsh. Only the centre of the lake is exposed, which is where the rowing course is.<br />
After that, we decided to hunt down Deer Lake, which is a slightly smaller, but more publicly accessible lake. (It&#8217;s rather interesting that both lakes are within 20 minutes of our apartment.) The area around Deer Lake is a park, and has some very interesting and very expensive buildings surrounding it. I don&#8217;t even want to know what the property prices are.<br />
After visiting Deer Lake, we filled the new propane tank and returned to the apartment to have dinner. This was slightly more difficult than I had originally hoped &#8230; I couldn&#8217;t connect the tank. It seems that a couple of years ago, the Canadian Propane Monopolies decided that they weren&#8217;t making enough money, and changed the attachments for the propane tanks. This, of course, required you to either get a new barbecue, or get a $20 piece of metal that would allow you to attach your tank to your barbecue. I&#8217;m still annoyed that no-one at Home Depot warned me. Argh.<br />
So Mr. Collins and I had to make another run to the nearest Home Depot to pick up an adapter to allow us to cook dinner. By the time we returned, dinner was ready to go on. After dinner, we watched Toy Story, which neither of Allison&#8217;s parents had seen before. I still don&#8217;t know if they really liked it or not.<br />
The next day, we went to Horseshoe Bay to drop off Allison&#8217;s parents at the ferry. We had lunch at Troll&#8217;s, a local legend and location of the best fish and chips I&#8217;ve had. After dropping off Mr. and Mrs. Collins, I convinced Allison that we should go to Whistler. Neither of us had been there before, and it sounded like fun.<br />
A lot of people complain about out-of-province drivers. &#8220;They go so fast!&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re dangerous!&#8221; Let me tell you something &#8212; all the cars tearing up and down those twisting mountain highways were bearing BC license plates. There was the odd out-of-province. And, brother, those were some of the most psychopathic drivers I&#8217;d ever seen. And whoever that moron in the red Dodge Pickup, license BE 5889 &#8212; if I catch you pulling the same shit you were with me, I&#8217;ll have your license revoked permanently!<br />
Anyway, Whister was nice. Creepily nice. And clean. Deathly clean. In fact, it reminded me a lot of Colorado Springs (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Thunderstorms, Kansas, and Colorado Springs]]). I figured that it was the tourist dollars being put to use keeping the city clean.<br />
It&#8217;s expensive there, though. A two-bedroom apartment sells for at least $200,000. Condos are worse. Especially if you&#8217;re near one of the ski-lifts. The clothes weren&#8217;t cheap either, but then again, this is one of BC&#8217;s biggest tourist destinations. So I guess it goes without saying that the prices will be higher.<br />
Following dinner at the Olde Spaghetti Factory, we headed home to Vancouver. Both of us had to be up the next morning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last Sunday (7 June 1998), we finished moving Allison out of her basement suite, and into my apartment. This was for a few reasons: First and foremost, Allison was going in for exploratory surgery, and wanted to recupperate in a more comfortable environment (her basement suite was a little too cozy for her liking); I also wanted her to move in with me so we could be closer together (we were spending large amounts of time and money getting back and forth between our places), and hopefully save some money through less expensive rent.<br />
We had to go back to her apartment to quickly clean it out (her landlords were pressuring her to make sure it was spotless, despite the fact that they had no legal right to do so), and so we could meet with Tyler, one of Allison&#8217;s best friends. When we finished, we made a quick dash back to my apartment (and the ensuing disaster area that we created moving things around), where I quickly took care of a shower &#8212; I smelled like something had died and rubbed itself all over my body.<br />
We left short thereafter, to go to an Indian restaurant at Main and 49th, in Vancouver. Allison owed Tyler a birthday dinner, which she was determined to give him at some point. Following the dinner, we would quickly return to Metrotown to catch a showing of &#8220;The Truman Show&#8221;.<br />
Dinner itself was uneventful (my butter chicken wasn&#8217;t bad, but after a while, I found it not settling with me too well), but fun. We left the restaurant with about 20 minutes to spare before the movie was to begin, but we had a long way to go. We piled back in the car, and I started driving towards the first major intersection (I had to turn around, but it was difficult on such a major road). I drove as far as 51st, before I realised that I was a fair distance from where I wanted to be. I decided a short jaunt down 51st to Fraser would be in my better interests. That was my first mistake.<br />
I drove east along 51st a bit faster than I would have liked, but slower than the speed limit (the road had a lot of cars, but we were in a bit of a hurry). I glanced ahead of me to make sure that there were no stop signs to slow me down, passing intersection after intersection. That was my second mistake.<br />
Why a mistake? What I didn&#8217;t notice is that there were no street signs at all. The entire neighbourhood was full of uncontrolled intersections, which I quickly found out about when I was hit by a BMW. The first thing I thought of was: &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; The second thing was: &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to make the movie.&#8221;<br />
Luckily, no-one was injured, but my car sustained a fair bit of damage &#8212; the front fender was bent, and as I found out later, the right right wheel was knocked out of alignment, and bent in at the top. I think the shock was also ruined, but I&#8217;m not sure. The BMW sustained scratches (at least from a cursory inspection).<br />
While Tyler attempted to get the police on his cell phone, the other driver and I swapped information. After about 15 minutes or so of waiting, we gave up and decided to leave. (BC law allows us to do so, as there were no injuries.) Tyler kept telling me to let him off and he&#8217;d take a bus, but I felt so bad about dragging him out and putting him into an accident, I wanted to make it up to him. In retrospect, I guess he didn&#8217;t want to be in the same car as a driver who had just been in an accident. Can&#8217;t blame him.<br />
I make it as far as the McDonald&#8217;s on SW Marine before I realised there was something seriously wrong with the steering. The fender I didn&#8217;t care about. But the steering was a whole other issue. It was then I realised that things were rapidly going downhill.<br />
The following day, Allison went in for surgery. I drove Allison&#8217;s car, so I could pick her and her mother up from the hospital. Allison was groggy from the anaesthesia, and I was still feeling a little strange about driving, so I took the trip home very delicately. Once we got in, Allison asked me to pick a few things up for her from the store.<br />
On my way back, I thought I should stop into the Autoplan broker, and find out what my insurance would be. I had just lost my good driver&#8217;s standing, so I needed to know how much I&#8217;d be paying. They gave me an estimate of $2,300. I nearly choked. I was paying less than half of that in Ontario. It seemed that the accident was going to hang like a dark cloud over my head.<br />
On Wednesday, I took the car into North Vancouver, to a recommended auto body repair shop. The man who looked at it (an immigrant from New Zealand, or so it sounded) suggested a different shop just down the road. I went in, had the car checked &#8230; $1,500. Mind you, that was after the shop foreman found out I had insurance. Otherwise, I&#8217;d have been in big trouble.<br />
I later found out that the BMW somehow got about $1,100 in damage. From scratches. I hate expensive cars.<br />
The rest of the week was pretty stressful, as was the weekend following. But those were for reasons I&#8217;m not getting into here. But the end result had me beginning to wonder if I really wanted to live here. I&#8217;m so far away from my friends and family, and I don&#8217;t find that I&#8217;m really being accepted here. I want to leave, I want to go away and not come back. I want to sell off all my stuff and run for the hills. The only think keeping me here, for now, is Allison.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The fallout from the round of layoffs a week and a half ago came to a rather disappointing end &#8212; one of our lead programmers decided he didn&#8217;t want to work for corporate America, and quit. Just as the game he was working on entered the final development stages. I still can&#8217;t believe that the Powers That Be could not see that coming. I suspect that Rory and Ian (the two driving forces of the company) predicted something like this would happen, but the final decision came from the States. Convenient that they don&#8217;t really have anything to do with this office.<br />
Then Marketting (also located in San Francisco) decided to get into the act. Earlier in the week, a couple of press releases got around about the deal Radical has with ESPN (we&#8217;re making video games for them). One of our investors, who writes a column for BC Technology, decided he&#8217;d start spewing out to the entire planet about the neat things we were doing.<br />
Problem: No-one was supposed to know until today.<br />
So Marketting decided they&#8217;d send around a message that pointed us at a rather heavily made-up internal website that warned employees about talking to the press. (They didn&#8217;t mention a thing about boneheaded investors.) That was mildy degrading. Two days later, we received the hard copies. Four-colour print on expensive-feeling paper. One copy for each person. Nice waste of money, especially so close to layoffs, eh?<br />
It turns out that the flyers were approved and printed before the financial crunch, but I still think that the idea to hand them around was extremely poor. Many people in San Francisco wonder if all of Vancouver hates them. I can safely say we don&#8217;t hate all of them &#8230; just selected people.<br />
Onto different things&#8230;<br />
I got out this weekend. I had originally decided to go out and get a haircut. I haven&#8217;t had a haircut in about three months, so it&#8217;s looking a little scraggly. (I don&#8217;t buy into the ol&#8217; &#8220;haircut every four weeks&#8221; baloney &#8212; that&#8217;s a ploy by the hairdressers of the world to make more money. Same applies for showering daily, which is really only needed unless you&#8217;re dirty or you smell bad.)<br />
Didn&#8217;t make it that far. Allison immediately suggested that we could go to White Rock. Having read a little about it, and not having been there yet, I thought it a good idea. So we hopped in my car, and took off in the general direction of the former resort town.<br />
Finding it was another issue. Although I knew approximately where White Rock was, I had no idea exactly how to get there. Neither did Allison, although she had a much better idea of where it was. We drove across the Knight St. bridge, and drove through Richmond. We eventually found ourselves in Delta, trying to find out way into Surrey. (White Rock is at the south end of Surrey.) Once we entered Surrey, I decided that it would be a good idea to get a roadmap. (Hey, I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who drives aimlessly for hours without asking where I&#8217;m going.)<br />
About 45 minutes or so after leaving home, we found the main drag in White Rock. We drove along for a short distance, and pulled into a parking lot at the side of the road. You could tell we were in a tourist trap &#8212; the parking cost a dollar an hour.<br />
We crossed the railway tracks (Burlington Northern runs a line between White Rock&#8217;s building and beach, a left-over from the heady days of being a resort town, I suspect) and walked towards the wharf, about a kilometre away. (We could have parked closer to the wharf, but we didn&#8217;t know exactly where we were.)<br />
Along the way, we ran into the White Rock, from which the town received its name. It&#8217;s a large boulder of white granite, an erratic left over from the days of the glaciers. Since White Rock was founded, the boulder has received a few coats of white paint, usually from the local graduates.<br />
The wharf (pier, boardwalk, whatever you want to call it) extends into Shemiamoo Bay about a half kilometre or so. At the end are a lot of people fishing, but mostly crabbing (throwing in crab cages and attempting to catch dinner).<br />
We wandered back through the town for a while, before I darted back to retrieve the car. (The parking meter was running low, and Allison&#8217;s new shoes weren&#8217;t exactly co-operating with her feet.) When I returned, I was met with a freight train that rolled along the tracks, (presumably) heading towards Vancouver.<br />
We stopped for a quick snack at an ice cream shop, and took a moment to relax somewhat (we had walked quite a while that morning). Having had our fill of White Rock (it doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; White Rock&#8217;s is quite small), we opted to travel further west along the shore.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Point Roberts. If you follow the western shoreline of Delta south, you pass by Tsawwassen, a major ferry terminal, just before you reach the 49th Parallel, and the end of Canada. But right at that point isn&#8217;t the end of the land &#8212; it actually goes just a bit further south, and into the United States.<br />
In 1854, after many years of arguments between the United States and Britain (who held domain on the western side of the Dominion of Canada), the border was extended across the 49th Parallel until it reached the Georgia Strait, where it dipped slightly to accomodate Fort Victoria, at the south end of Vancouver Island. Originally, the Americans had wanted the border to allow them access right up the coast to Alaska (then-President Polk was elected on the slogan &#8220;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&#8221;), but eventually the Americans and the British agreed on the treaty of 1827, setting the border at the 49th Parallel. Because Point Roberts wasn&#8217;t on the oceans, it became cut off from Canada.<br />
But you&#8217;d never know. Pretty much the entire 4.9 square mile peninsula caters to Canadian interests. There are many beach homes (which sell for as little as US$50,000), and the area is almost completely undeveloped. But most amenities are available, and some of the municipal services (water, hospital) come from neighbouring Canada. The grocery stores take Canadian money with no question. And due to the relative tight security (you have to go through a border crossing when entering and exiting Point Roberts), the crime rate is also very low.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long. Just enough to buy some cheap cheese, and fill up on cheap American gas. We thought we might even stay for dinner, but Point Roberts isn&#8217;t exactly known for its good food. We headed home, but ended up in Richmond to eat at Antonio&#8217;s, a tasty pasta bar.<br />
On Sunday, Allison and I made a quick spin of Metrotown, so we could obtain some free shorts, and peruse the haircutting establishments (none of which I was at all thrilled with). I then pretty much resigned myself to cleaning up my apartment. Having acquired some furniture from IKEA earlier in the week, I was determined to try and clean up my apartment a little.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this is my first crack at a proper Branch entry. Hopefully these will go as well as I hope they do&#8230;<br />
My weekend got off to a bit of a rocky start &#8212; my company laid off 12 people in our Vancouver office. The CEO and CFO of our company (both from our San Francisco office) came up to inform us of the situation. The two driving forces of the company, Ian and Rory (the guys, who IMHO are the men behind the curtain) broke the bad news, and the CEO and CFO put the spin on it.<br />
Now I know why I didn&#8217;t like working for Corporate America &#8212; the spin. I hate spin. I like hard, cold, unsugared facts. I have to give Rory and Ian their credit &#8212; they know their staff well. The CEO on the other hand, well, he needs to be here a little more often to understand us, I guess. All I know is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought his presentation was a little too slick.<br />
On Friday, Allison and I decided we&#8217;d head to Nanaimo for the long weekend. Allison had not been home since our last excursion at Easter, and wanted to go home for a short while. I, too, wanted to go, because it would allow me to get out of the city for a brief period of time. (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says &#8212; a change of scenery is a must from time to time.<br />
Allison picked me up at the office just after 12:00 on Friday afternoon. Our first destination was Granville Island, so we could visit the market. Our plan was to bring over all the goodies needed to have a good west coast barbecue.<br />
Following a brief lunch, we looked around at the various shops. We purchased vegetables (asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), fruit (strawberries), bread (sourdough), salmon steaks wild sockeye), and a bottle of a not-too-dry white wine. The whole shebang came out to around $40. (The salmon and wine accounted for most of the cost.)<br />
By the time we left, we found we would be hard-pressed to get to the ferry at Tsawassen in time. So we opted for the Horseshoe Bay ferry. One minor problem: We weren&#8217;t the only ones with that idea.<br />
By the time we got to Burrard, the street was backed up. It took over 10 minutes to crawl a few measly blocks. Georgia was even worse &#8212; traffic was solid for several blocks. But when we finally cleared the entrance to Stanley Park, the flow began to speed up. However, it was already 14:10, and we had to be at the ferry no later than 14:40 &#8230; if we were lucky enough to find parking.<br />
We had not been able to beat the rush to the long weekend, which was clearly evident by the very long lineup for the ferry. It looked like a three or four sailing wait for some people. Since Allison and I were aiming to be walk-ons, we were able to scoot down into Horseshoe Bay to look for a parking lot. Luck shone on us that day &#8212; we got one of the last spots.<br />
Despite some communication problems, we managed to contact Allison&#8217;s parents. They picked us up at the ferry, and we went to the Collins&#8217; for dinner. Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t started to make dinner yet. It was barbecue night.<br />
The next day, Allison and I thought we&#8217;d do some driving. Mrs. Collins suggested Cathedral Grove, which is a rather famous patch of old-growth forest near the very middle of the Island. Mr. Collins thought Coombs would be a nice stop along the way. Mrs. Collins then started to tell Allison about the new interchanges in the area &#8230; then promptly decided that the four of us should go on the trip. I had no objections.<br />
We stopped along the way at Rathtrevor beach, so I could see what a good tidal beach looked like. I don&#8217;t know how far out that beach went, but it looked like a half-kilometre. At high tide, the beach would completely vanish. All I could think was that the beach would be immense fun in the summer.<br />
We proceeded north to Parksville, where we turned onto the Port Alberni Highway, and headed west. Not too far from Parksville, we entered Coombs, a little town in the Island interior. Coombs probably used to be nothing more than a mining or logging town. Today it has a thriving little tourist business, formed around the Coombs market. What&#8217;s so special about the market? It&#8217;s not every day you see a sod roof with real goats parading about.<br />
Soon we entered Cathedral Grove. It&#8217;s a provincial park that was created from land donated by H.R. MacMillian, a forester who founded HR MacMillian (part of MacMillian-Blodel industries, if I&#8217;m not mistaken). Yes, Her-mac (as one call it) is a logging company. Sounds a little weird for a founder of a company that has come under a lot of fire for logging old growth-trees to donate a small forest of old-growth trees for parkland, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, Mr. MacMillan was apparently a nice guy, and wanted the future to know what the past looked like. Public outcry also forwarded the cause.<br />
Cathedral Grove is aptly named &#8212; I have never in my life seen trees so large. But even trees so large are not immune to the environment. On Jan. 1, 1997, there was a tremendous windstorm that tore through the grove. It knocked over several trees and thousands of branches. Several parts of the forest floor were complete littered with timber. But none of it was cleaned out &#8212; the park is to remain almost completely untouched.<br />
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Coombs, to shop at the market, and look around. It&#8217;s a nice little market &#8230; with a few hundred people packed in. But it&#8217;s worth the drive &#8230; at least, I thought it was worth the drive.<br />
We had a late lunch in the restaurant, and wandered through the multitude of wares in the market. (Oddly enough, most of the wares were Mexican &#8230; a little strange, IMHO, considering the Native influences in BC.) I purchased two very large Mexican hand-woven blankets (which are really warm). Allison bought a handful of paper mache vegetables for decoration.<br />
Returning home, we sat down to the task of making dinner. But even then, we didn&#8217;t eat until 20:00 or so. I offered to try and fix Mrs. Collins&#8217; email problems on her computer. She&#8217;d been having problems with the addressbook, and having multiple copies of Netscape floating around.<br />
The next day we rose early to go see the Victoria Day Parade. The Victoria Day Parade is a big thing out here. Few places in Ontario (only Ottawa comes to mind, and apparently Orillia also carries on the tradition) have a formal parade. In Ontario, the Victoria Day Weekend is more commonly known as the &#8220;May Two-Four&#8221; (the weekend was traditionally around May 24th, and a case of 24 beers is known as a &#8220;two-four&#8221;). It&#8217;s essentially the start of the cottage season in Ontario.<br />
We arrived downtown at about 10:40, expecting the parade to start at 11:00 (which was what we were led to believe). However, we noticed that there were still a lot of cars on the parade route, not all the reviewing stands had been completed, and we were the only people standing around. Mr. Collins soon found out that we had come too early &#8212; the parade didn&#8217;t start until 13:00.<br />
So we went wandering down on the waterfront. It was a nice day, albeit a little chilly from the wind. The weekend had brought a small amusement park to the waterfront (where just attractions appear during festive weekends). We had a batch of less-than-satisfactory french fries (they left a horrible taste in my mouth, and neither Allison or I were feeling too good as a result).<br />
At about 12:45, we headed back to the road to see the parade. When we arrived, the crowds that I had been expecting had appeared. Just after 13:00, the first sign of the parade went by &#8212; a fire truck. I had forgotten what community parades were like. It had been so long since my last one.<br />
I found out after the weekend that one of my co-workers, Greg Mayer, had been on the Hungarian Cultural float (it won for best Cultural Presentation, and Best Presentation Overall). We had somehow managed not to see each other.<br />
We had to hurry back to the Collins&#8217; to go to a family barbecue with Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents. We were sidetracked temporarily at home. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and had to lie down for a while before continuing out again.<br />
The barbecue was great &#8212; Mrs. Collins had made a potato salad that was exactly like the one my mother makes. It was like being at home. We ate until there was no food left to eat, and then ate some more. Dessert was a berry mix on a sponge cake, with whipped cream. Very tasty. Mostly considering that until this weekend, I didn&#8217;t eat berries. Things just keep changing&#8230;<br />
After dinner, we went inside where Allison and I watched the last episode of Murphy Brown. It was sad to see such a good show go, but it was a good last episode. Between Murphy Brown and the X-Files (which came on later), we went into the kitchen to make &#8220;stamps&#8221;. These were pieces of paper that you stamped with ink, and then sprinkled a special glitter overtop. Using a heater, you melted the glitter to make the stamp. It was fun. I won a prize.<br />
Then the final episode of the X-Files came on. Well, the final one that was filmed in Vancouver, anyway. (For we Canucks, it might as well be the final one.) I felt bad because I pretty much had the entire family in the living room watching a show that really didn&#8217;t seem to appeal to anyone. It was only a plot-builder for the movie being released this summer.<br />
Following the movie, the Collins and I made a hasty retreat back to the waterfront to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, we were late in arriving, and the fireworks had already started. As a result, we didn&#8217;t get out of the car. On the bright side though, we managed to be the first car out of there, and missed all the traffic. I felt bad again for making everyone miss the start of the fireworks.<br />
I tried to amend for my selfishness by buying coffee (and hot chocolate) and donuts (and muffins) for the Collins on our way back home.<br />
The next day, the weather couldn&#8217;t make up its mind. It was either rainy or somewhat sunny &#8212; there was no comfortable medium. We left late in the afternoon, catching the 16:30 ferry from Departure Bay. For those of you who know the ferry schedule, yes, that is not a standard ferry time. Extra ferries were running to cope with the traffic.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once again, I&#8217;ve left writing too long, and probably forgotten details of the events of my life. So if I forget anything, I apologise in advance&#8230;<br />
A couple of weeks ago, I decided it was high time that I started taking matters in my own hand &#8230; namely, I needed some exercise. I wasn&#8217;t getting out enough, and I was really afraid that I&#8217;d lose my figure. So it was time to start biking.<br />
My goal was to bike to and from work every day, rain or shine. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the only person &#8212; a good portion of Vancouverites engage in such activity, and it&#8217;s so popular at Radical, that we even have a dedicated bike storage room. (And having showers available certainly entices one all the more.)<br />
Some of you may remember that I made such a boast last year, when I said I would bike from Oakville to Toronto every day. Poor pathetic me didn&#8217;t realise just how far away Toronto was. I biked once, then left my bike there for about two months before bringing it home.<br />
But I said things would be different this time. So one evening, I ventured down to the locker room, pulled out my bike, and straightened out the handlebars (they were turned sideways when it was shipped out).<br />
The following morning, I make my first attempt to bike to work. I went across Grange to where it connected with Kingsway, briefly over to Boundary, and then proceeded north on Boundary to Adanac, which was the bikeway. It took me at least 15 minutes to get to Adanac.<br />
Despite the fact that a large portion of the trip to Adanac was downhill, I was wiped by the time I got there. I couldn&#8217;t believe how out of shape I was. And I still had to cross the city of Vancouver. I proceeded along Adanac, and felt ill to my stomach&#8230;<br />
The only bright point was that I had a shower waiting for me. And I really needed it too! When I went home that night, I went by MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop) to buy a new backpack. The one I have is for hiking, and is completely ill-suited for the purposes of biking. Similarly, my nylon briefcase is painful to wear for that length of time.<br />
When I resumed my riding the next morning, I found a new expression of pain in the saddlesores I had acquired. One does not get a full appreciation of how hilly it is here until one has to bike it.<br />
However, I persevered, to the point where I dragged Allison out on the Saturday for a bike ride around Stanley Park. Oh wow&#8230; I knew that Stanley Park was nice, but I didn&#8217;t think it was *that* nice. For all the reasons that I hated leaving Ontario, the ability to bike around Stanley Park outweighs a large chunk of them.<br />
That night, we went out with one of Allison&#8217;s friends (Rhona-Mae), who was leaving for home (High River, AB) the following day. We went to the Blarney Stone, where we wanted to throttle the doorman for not letting us in for almost an hour. Stupid nightclub politics&#8230;<br />
The following week was Hell Week for me &#8212; my group was putting out a new version of our 3D rendering system, and I had a lot of stuff to document. It was not a nice week at all. This culminated in a couple of nights where I got very little sleep. In one night, I slept about an hour. The next night I ended up sleeping at the office because I was behind in my deadlines.<br />
Allison and I are looking forward to the weekend. Unlike the infamous May Two-Four weekend in Ontario, we just have various festivals. We&#8217;re going to Nanaimo for the weekend, and a slew of barbecues. Ought to be fun&#8230;<br />
Yesterday, my work got flipped on its ear for a little while. I was happily working away, when I received a phone call. At first, I thought it was going to be Allison (we were planning to go see a movie). It was a familiar voice. My father&#8217;s.<br />
Immediately my brain began to have the following conversation:<br />
Left: It&#8217;s dad.<br />
Right: So?<br />
Left: Why would he be calling me?<br />
Right: Hmm&#8230; something important, no doubt. He doesn&#8217;t call otherwise.<br />
Left: He doesn&#8217;t sound upset.<br />
Right: True. Must be something else.<br />
Left: You don&#8217;t suppose&#8230;<br />
Right: Suppose what?<br />
Left: That he&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;in Vancouver?<br />
Left: Oh&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;S**t!<br />
Sure enough, dear ol&#8217; dad had appeared in Vancouver. Why? Because he decided to drive out. Confused? Good, &#8216;cuz I still am&#8230;<br />
You see, when I moved out here, I didn&#8217;t bring my car. I figured I would have it brought out when the time was right. I hadn&#8217;t needed it, so as far as I was concerned, it was a moot point. But my father had wanted to bring it out, dragging my poor mother along for the ride.<br />
So I started talking with my friend Joe, who was living in Toronto, and looking for a new job. I figured he&#8217;d be the perfect person to take my car for a ride. So I started into negotiations, prodding him, bribing him, all sorts of devious under-handed things to get him to drive my car here.<br />
And then my dad shows up with it. At least he didn&#8217;t bring my mother. She was safe at home.<br />
So needless to say, my evening went down the drain rapidly. On the bright side, my father, Allison, and I went out to dinner at the Yaletown Brewery. I figured he could use a couple of beers after the trip out. After that, I drove Allison home, and dad crashed in my bed.<br />
I stayed up to try and find him passage back home. Most of the major airlines wanted at least $1200 for a last-minute one-way ticket. This sort of thing really bothers me. If I call two weeks in advance, it&#8217;s $400. Why should the price rise so much? Lousy capitalism&#8230;<br />
This morning I woke up bright and early at 06:55 &#8230; an hour before I planned to get up. It seemed that dad thought I had to get up at that time. I guess my repeated suggestions that Vancouver time differs quite a bit from Toronto time had gone unnoticed. (I don&#8217;t normally get up until around 08:00.)<br />
My mother called a scant five moments later to tell me that Canada 3000 had deals on their airfare. I had to remind my mom that I wasn&#8217;t in Saskatchewan, and that BC is *three* hours behind, not *two*. (It wasn&#8217;t the first time that she had done that to me.) I made a quick arrangement and booked the flight.<br />
The three of us went out to dinner again, but this time to the Pink Pearl, a Chinese restaurant downtown. It wasn&#8217;t anything to wow about, but at least the food was good. I was a little annoyed at the price, though. I didn&#8217;t think the place would cost so much (it came out to just over $20 a person).<br />
Tomorrow, we dump dear ol&#8217; dad at the airport so he can wing his way back to Toronto. Allison and I are off to Nanaimo on Friday afternoon (I think). I hope everyone has a good weekend, and I&#8217;ll let you know what happened with mine!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entry is long overdue &#8212; I should have issued this sometime last week. But it&#8217;s been one of those weeks where I&#8217;ve barely had time to check my email, let alone write any.<br />
It all started a few weeks ago, when I heard through the grapevine that my mother and my mother&#8217;s mother (to whom all the young&#8217;uns on this side of the family affectionately refer to as &#8220;Nana&#8221;) were going to be visiting my aunt and uncle in Calgary. This was a particularly good thing for me &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen my mother in a couple of months, I hadn&#8217;t seen Nana since early September, I hadn&#8217;t seen Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike (not to mention my hyper little cousin Jennifer) since August, nor had I seen Pam since that time (she also lives in Calgary, but is the daughter of another part of the family), and I hadn&#8217;t seen Stuart or Therese since Christmas.<br />
No, Stuart and Therese aren&#8217;t a part of my biological family. They are however, two of my closest friends in the world &#8212; and are for all intents and purposes, my extended family. Having to shift from seeing them nearly everyday, to seeing them once every few months isn&#8217;t easy. And I&#8217;d been wanting to see them for quite a while, especially since they had bought two new siamese kittens.<br />
So I sat down and looked at the cost of airfare. Allison looked at the cheapest ways out there &#8212; by car, and by bus. She wanted to come (and I wanted her to come), but she didn&#8217;t have the money to pay for the $200 airfare. (We&#8217;d missed the seat sale requirements by one lousy day.)<br />
For a while, it looked like Allison wouldn&#8217;t be able to go. And I really wasn&#8217;t keen on going without her. But then luck shined upon the both of us &#8230; she &#8220;found&#8221; $800 in her bank accounts. As her father put it: &#8220;Only Allison could find $800.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know how she did it, but at that point, I didn&#8217;t care to find out.<br />
To ease our travelling (and get the cheapest airfare possible), we opted to leave early on Friday the 17th. Allison got the day off, and I just didn&#8217;t bother to go in (my office has such flexible time that I can decide not to come in one day, just so long as I make the time up at some point).<br />
We drove down to Richmond (where YVR &#8212; the Vancouver Airport &#8212; sprawls over Sea Island), and hunted for a cheap place to park Allison&#8217;s car. We found a lot at the Comfort Inn that charged only $3 a day. We had considered taking the bus, but we were coming back at 08:20 on the Monday, and Allison needed a quick (and inexpensive) way to work.<br />
We were flying WestJet, a small airline that offers really cheap airfare between cities in the west (they have extended as far as Winnipeg, but whether they&#8217;ll go any further is anyone&#8217;s guess). We checked in, got our tickets (WestJet doesn&#8217;t issue &#8220;real&#8221; tickets, only boarding passes, which have to be picked up the day of the flight), and went to have breakfast. (WestJet doesn&#8217;t offer meals on their flights, and we were starving.)<br />
The flight was quite nice &#8212; we flew in an arc over northern Washington State, recieving a wonderful view of area around Mount Baker, and we could see as far as Mount Ranier.<br />
We arrived in Calgary around 11:20. As we touched down, Allison noted that it was &#8220;rather flat&#8221;. The Calgary-bashing had started. We weaved our way through the terminal to the baggage claim, so I could get my backpack. While we waited, I inquired about taking a bus downtown.<br />
We had to meet my cousin Pam at her office. She had graciously offered us the use of her sofa-bed and even her car (which she barely used) during our stay in Calgary. I checked in with her, and arranged for a time.<br />
We hopped a bus, which took us down to the Whitehorn C-Train station. (The C-Train is Calgary&#8217;s LRT system, and is part-and-parcel of their transit system.) We took the train downtown to the approximate intersection where we found find Pam&#8217;s office building.<br />
My only gripe about Calgary is that the road systems are WAY too confusing. Downtown, everything is numbered &#8212; streets and avenues. If someone gives you the information backwards by accident, you could end up blocks away. To further complicate issues, downtown is also where the city is split up into quadrants &#8212; so the roads restart their numbering four times. Fortunately, we were always in the southern quadrants while looking for Pam.<br />
The Petro-Canada tower wasn&#8217;t hard to find, and surprisingly enough, neither was Pam &#8212; we ran into her after had a bite to eat for lunch. At first I didn&#8217;t recognise her &#8212; she seemed to have lost a little weight from the last time I saw her. (Then again, she had been wearing a thick sweater that time.)<br />
She gave us instructions, the keys to her apartment and her car, and the code to get into her building. We were off again, to find her illusive apartment. Her instructions weren&#8217;t exactly correct, we found ourselves dumped at a parking lot (and yes, we had followed those instructions correctly). A shift of two blocks east corrected that problem).<br />
Our first order of business was to see the family. Pam had warned us that they were out, and wouldn&#8217;t be back until 15:30 that afternoon. So we thought we&#8217;d take our time and look around a little. We decided to go for a drive in Pam&#8217;s car.<br />
In general, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of most Japanese cars &#8212; I don&#8217;t fit in them very well. (The problems with being a large person.) I had complained a few times about Allison&#8217;s Toyota Corolla, because it was small (for me &#8212; Allison kept saying I should make a concerted effort to be smaller). Pam&#8217;s Nissan Micra made me feel claustrophobic.<br />
The sun in the Prairies is bright. I had forgotten how bright &#8212; Vancouver&#8217;s sun is muted by the cloud cover. The both of us ended up buying sunglasses to counter the painful squinting.<br />
We arrived at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house a little after 15:30 (after arriving early, finding no-one home, and then going off to purchase the aforementioned sunglasses). My aunt Brenda answered the door, motioned us to be quiet, and pointed at the kitchen. I boldly walked into the kitchen, plunked my bags down, and loudly announced &#8220;Hello&#8221;.<br />
Oh &#8230; did I mention that neither my mother or Nana knew that I was coming?<br />
My mother looked up at me, and there was an instant look of recognition in her face &#8230; quickly followed by the look that appears as the visual thought of something that is out of place. Surprise followed soon after. Nana, on the other hand, seemed completely overwhelmed by the seemingly unending surprises.<br />
Allison and I sat down and talked with my relatives for a while, during which various family members came and went. Eventually, it was our turn to leave. Our family night was planned for the following night, and I really wanted to see Stuart and Therese.<br />
We spent a little time at Therese and Stuart&#8217;s (trying mostly to get their two new kittens to come out from under the bed long enough so I could see them) before we decided to go out to dinner.<br />
Stuart suggested that we try Montana&#8217;s, a chain of steakhouses that had finally migrated to Calgary. Therese referred to it as &#8220;Stuart and Geoff food&#8221;, which I have to admit, I took some offense to. My diet has changed quite significantly since I arrived in Vancouver, and I tend not to eat all the things I used to.<br />
At any rate, the place was packed, and we ended up at Joey Tomatoes not too far away. It was a pretty decent meal all around. And it gave us a good time to sit and talk and visit.<br />
Afterwards, we went back to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s, where we continued to talk a while longer. Well, most of us talked a while longer. Therese kept dropping off. She works a lot at school, and it takes a lot out of her. One day, she&#8217;ll be able to stay up after midnight&#8230;<br />
When Allison and I arrived home that night, we were ultra-careful not to wake up Pam. The sofa-bed was already set up, and it didn&#8217;t take us long to go to sleep.<br />
The next day, Allison and I decided that we would visit Banff. Although we had both been there before (not at the same time), we wanted to visit again. In both cases, we had only a short time to look around, and Banff is one of those places you really need to see carefully.<br />
The trip out was uneventful &#8230; except we were wondering whether Pam&#8217;s Micra would make it intact. It was a peppy little car &#8230; going downhill. The hour-and-a-half drive was a little more than the car could take.<br />
But it was worth the drive. Banff was in full bloom (snow included), and was quite the sight to see. The tourists were mostly gone (I guess it wasn&#8217;t their time of the year anymore) &#8230; except for the throngs of people waiting outside of the Roots. We guessed that someone like Elvis Stojko or Ross Rebigilati was inside.<br />
We visited the Hot Springs (the wrong ones, so it turned out &#8212; the original hot springs were in a different location), the Banff Springs Hotel (I have to stay there at least one night in my life), and drove around in the town. Finally, we headed back to Calgary for dinner with the family.<br />
The next day, on a suggestion from my family, we visited Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, an historical site in the southern portion of Alberta. In use for nearly 5,700 years, the buffalo jump was a cliff that natives used to kill large groups of buffalo.<br />
The museum is built into the side of the cliff, not too far from the location of the actual buffalo jump. Great care was taken in building the site, such that it wouldn&#8217;t affect the any of the archeological remains in the area. The design, combined with the unbelievable quality of the education, garnered the museum the honour of being a UNESCO site. It was worth the five hour round-trip.<br />
We asked Stuart to come along with us, mostly because it would get him out of the apartment he shared with Therese. (Therese had to mark 40 20-page essays, and having Stuart around wasn&#8217;t exactly helpful.) Furthermore, I wanted to see as much of my friends as possible.<br />
The next morning, we had to catch our flight back to Vancouver. By that point, we had pretty much come to the conclusion that we could not live in Calgary. Allison had written off Calgary within a few moments of arriving (her first comment was: &#8220;It&#8217;s flat!&#8221;), but it didn&#8217;t take too long for me to realise that Calgary was no longer for me either.<br />
Having arrived in Calgary from Ontario, I found it very nice. But after living in Vancouver for nearly four months, I found Calgary&#8217;s appeal much lessened. I suspect that I shall have a hard time finding another place I love as much.<br />
And if you&#8217;re wondering just how I came to this conclusion, when I arrived back in Vancouver, not only did I feel more relaxed, but I felt like I was home. Not just back where I lived, but where I felt I should live.<br />
We then had the nasty task of attempting to find Allison&#8217;s car. We couldn&#8217;t remember the name of the company we had left it with. I knew it was a set of initials, but I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. We eventually remembered that the lot was at the Comfort Inn. It seemed that DPS, the people we left the car with, were known as Diamond Parking Services &#8230; everywhere except on their signs.<br />
On Sunday (the 28th), we delivered Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, to the Hand of Fate &#8212; and the airport. Jane was moving to Europe. She had made the decision that she would live in Britain for a while &#8230; about a year.<br />
And she was not too excited about it either. Well, she was and she wasn&#8217;t. Most importantly, she was terrified. This was the first time she had been away from home. Mrs. Collins was almost as worried as Jane.<br />
I was envious. She was going somewhere I hadn&#8217;t been. I want to go to Europe. I&#8217;ve never been, and there&#8217;s so much to see. Perhaps one day I will go. Allison even hinted that we could visit with Jane.<br />
I wish her well, and hope that she has the time of her life. She will likely be a very different person when I meet her next. I only hope that life doesn&#8217;t jade her.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting few days. This weekend, as you already know, was Easter. This was the first time I was not in Ontario for Easter. I had been away from home before &#8212; usually on co-op terms (although university often did its fair share), but this was the first time that I was threatened with complete isolation from all friends and family.<br />
But I was saved by the graciousness of the Collins. They invited me to spend the Easter holidays with them. I, of course, accepted. I wasn&#8217;t interested in sitting in my lonely apartment all weekend.<br />
Allison and I left on Friday moring, catching the 12:30 ferry to Nanaimo. We went downtown to catch the 257 Horseshoe Bay Express. We didn&#8217;t want to take the car over &#8212; BC Ferries is in my opinion (and probably others) prohibitively expensive.<br />
We took the bus from the start of its route. This was Allison&#8217;s idea &#8212; and a very good one. When we got to the stop at the Bay on West Georgia, there were approximately a hundred people waiting. Our bus was full in a matter of moments.<br />
While we waited for people to board, someone knocked on the window. It was Jane, Allison&#8217;s sister. She was returning from the Arts Council Festival (or something like that), featuring Holly MacNarland and Great Big Sea. She was heading home for work. However, she would not be able get on our bus. BC Transit, however, is not for a lack of intelligence. They had another bus following ours, which picked up the remainder of the waiting passengers.<br />
The ferry traffic was heavy. Lots of cars, and lots of people. We made the sailing (so did Jane and her friend, Renata), which was 15 minutes late in leaving. During the crossing, we called Allison&#8217;s parents to inform them that there would be four of us, not just two. (This was important because we were to be picked up &#8230; and no matter how hard you try, you can&#8217;t pack six people into a Honda Civic.)<br />
That night was a quiet dinner with Allison, her parents, and her brother, Randy, when he arrived home from work. It was a roast of beef that came without yorkshire pudding or cheese sauce (for the broccoli), a result of Allison&#8217;s aunt Vicky appearing and staying too long. (Allison&#8217;s mom, who is Vicky&#8217;s sister, could not break away to continue with dinner.)<br />
Afterwards, we played Scrabble. It was a rather interesting game, mostly because the two English majors (Allison and myself) could not defeat Allison&#8217;s father. I could not remember the last time I had played, if ever.<br />
The next day, Allison took me around Nanaimo, showing me some of the different little townships that made up the whole city (and let me tell you &#8212; Nanaimo is a huge city). We went down to the waterfront (which apparently wasn&#8217;t a waterfront until a few decades ago &#8212; most of it was filled in), where the last bastion of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company remains presevered.<br />
We walked along the concrete and steel railed wharf, passing by such interesting things as the Javawocky, a little cafe. Most of the boats in the harbour (that we could see) were fishing trawlers. I didn&#8217;t know if there were in harbour because of the holiday, or were idled due to the drop in the fishing industry. Most looked in good condition, so I can only assume it was the holiday.<br />
We continued down to an artificial lagoon. which the city had built to enhance the waterfront. It created a small, sheltered beach, and calm water that remained even when the tide was low. Stray logs from the log booms that are towed through Georgia Strait had washed to the beach &#8230; or had been dragged there for character. On the other side of the lagoon was a large children&#8217;s playground, perhaps the most exciting looking one I&#8217;d ever seen. I wished I was 10 again.<br />
Not far away was a bronze statue of an ex-mayor who was &#8220;affectionately&#8221; known as &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. He was the man who invented the idea of the Bathtub Races (you only way you could *not* have heard about the Nanaimo Bathtub Race is if you&#8217;ve been living in a dark room for the past few decades). He dressed as a pirate (especially during said races), which is where he obtained the name &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. However. as a mayor, he did some pretty questionable (and in a few cases, down-right unethical) things, so the name had more than one connotation.<br />
That night, we had a full turkey dinner (again, with a delayed Randy) with Grandma Collins, a wonderful woman who was an utter delight to have conversation with. She certainly didn&#8217;t strike me as the &#8220;typical&#8221; little old lady. She was more concerned with having fun.<br />
After dinner, Allison and I went out with Kelly, an old friend of Allison&#8217;s whom she hadn&#8217;t seen in over four years, and went to a pub downtown (nearly everything else closes down early in Nanaimo &#8230; even coffee shops) for a few drinks. None of us had anything alcoholic, but we were there for a couple of hours.<br />
The next morning was the day of the Easter Egg hunts. I can&#8217;t honestly remember the last time that the Easter Bunny visited my sister and I, but I can guess at it being many, many years. Well, it seems that the Easter Bunny is alive and well in Nanaimo &#8230; and he made many a visit this morning.<br />
First off was in the Collins household. It seems that there is a tradition, where the two resident rabbits (Mr. and Mrs. Collins) hide things in the kitchen. I was an unwitting inductee. Amongst various chocolates, I also received a t-shirt. I was extremely surprised (not expecting anything of the sort), and most thankful.<br />
Then it was off to Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents (less than a five minute drive) for lunch. That was, lunch after the Easter Egg hunt. (Yes, another one.) This time, the hunt was more elaborate. Everyone (except Mr. and Mrs. Vaillette &#8212; I apologise if the spelling is incorrect) had a plastic egg hidden somewhere around the tree. Inside the egg was a rhyme, which was our clue to the location of our prize (hidden by Brenna, one of Allison&#8217;s cousins).<br />
Needless to say, I think I was terribly well treated for an outsider. But you won&#8217;t hear me complaining!<br />
Well, there&#8217;s not much more at this point &#8230; more will come later on as I continue. But life resumes tomorrow &#8212; back to work, back to playing games.</p>
