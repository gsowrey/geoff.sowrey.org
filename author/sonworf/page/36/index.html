	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing like the feeling of soul crushing debt.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s not that bad. Especially when there&#8217;s a darn good reason for it. In my case, it&#8217;s because the last formality of the conditions has been cleared, and the sale is now final. (Yes, I could still technically back out, but it would cost me $10,000, which I&#8217;m not ready to fork out.)<br />
This morning, Chris and I hiked over to what will soon be our new address so I could meet with the home inspector (Don) and go over the results of his findings. This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever met with a home inspector &#8212; or even known a home inspector &#8212; and I have to say that this is one job I&#8217;m not sure that I would want.<br />
Don has to know everything about a house &#8212; what goes into its construction (and that covers all existing homes, new and old), what goes on inside it (heating and cooling systems, water delivery, electrical, etc.), and what could potentially bring it down. This means that there is a huge amount of information that he has to know.<br />
And a lot he had to tell me.<br />
Don&#8217;t think that the house is a lemon &#8212; it isn&#8217;t. Not by a long shot, especially for its age. There were a few things that I need to do, and preferably soon. One is the roof &#8212; apparently some of the shingles are in need of replacement. This is something that will have to wait a year &#8212; I certainly can&#8217;t afford it now. Another is the eavestroughs &#8212; they should be replaced, and the downspouts moved away from the house. (There&#8217;s some slight water damage in the southeast foundation corner that needs patching as a result.)<br />
Beyond that, the rest is functional (or cosmetic) maintenance, and nothing I can&#8217;t take care of regularly. This was what I expected. This is a used home &#8212; people have lived in it before me, so it&#8217;s not going to be perfect. But considering the condition that it&#8217;s in, and it&#8217;s location, I think I got a real bargain on it.<br />
Given, it&#8217;s not huge &#8212; it&#8217;s only two bedrooms &#8212; but it&#8217;s a roof, a sanctuary, and it&#8217;s mine. No more rent (just mortgage payments), no more elevators (just a flight of stairs), no more showers that change temperature every five seconds (just have to make sure to not run out of hot water), no more trying to find a parking spot in the building (but the garage does need a bit of work), no more listening to CP trains or emergency vehicles echoing around (not sure what we&#8217;ll have where we are, if anything) &#8230; it&#8217;s not paradise, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.<br />
So this is one less thing I get to babble about now. Considering I was at this for only a month, I&#8217;m almost surprised at how fast this all came together. In fact, I feel so lucky, I should go buy a lottery ticket.<br />
Now you just get to hear about all the stuff that goes along with *owning* a home.</p>

		<p>The more things change, the more they get strange.<br />
Yesterday, I left the office at noon. This was partly because I&#8217;d been here all night (we were working on a pitch for a client who would be worth a LOT to us) and was caught up in a conspiracy of people forcing me to go home. But added to that, I was meeting with Robyn to go look and some more homes.<br />
There were four on the list, some nearby, and others a little further away. One was in Inglewood (a trendy little area east of downtown), which although nice had a few things that didn&#8217;t sit well with me. The second was in Bridgeland (just north east of downtown). Aside from the fact that it had tenants in the basement suite (and the renovations to make that suite weren&#8217;t all that great, either), I didn&#8217;t think the overall design was great.<br />
House #3 was a considerable improvement. Located just north of downtown in Crescent Heights, it was a beautiful home &#8212; tastefully painted stucco, a nice large front room, great design care inside, and great landscaping. But at nearly $220,000, I had a hard time with the warped floors, tiny kitchen, abysmal basement, and rather unattractive bathroom.<br />
The fourth home was in West Hillhurst, about two or three blocks from Crowchild Trail. On the outside, it was HIDEOUS. Unpainted stucco that really needed some help. My initial impression: This was gonna be a dud. But if there&#8217;s one thing I learned from that house: Don&#8217;t judge a house by its exterior. The owners must do design of some kind for a living. They had it coordinated out the wahzoo &#8212; the entire first floor was completely redesigned in (somewhat recent) IKEA. The only issues with the home were the basement (the stairs down looked unstable and felt twice as bad) and the fact that it sat on a major road.<br />
The afternoon adventure over, I retreated to my apartment to try and get some sleep. No sooner than I had started to drift off than the phone rang.<br />
&#8220;Get your butt downstairs! I&#8217;ve got another place in Sunnyside!&#8221;<br />
Ten minutes later, Robyn and I were back on the road. The house had been on the market for about an hour. (Robyn moves fast.) It was not only the kind of home I was looking for, it was even in the right area of Sunnyside (west end, close to Kensington).<br />
It gets better.<br />
Remember the home that I put the offer in on last Saturday? (See [[Finding a Great House, Losing in a Bidding War]].) Well, this house is it&#8217;s mirrored twin sister neighbour (say that five times fast). Mirroring aside, the only other differences were a double garage and a higher price. The higher price I wasn&#8217;t big on, but it was worth a look.<br />
Well, it would have been, if I could get in to see it. But Robyn always has a trick or two up her sleeve. We put in an offer on the house, with an extra condition: I had to view it and approve. A little strange, perhaps, but such is the nature of the real estate industry. As it stands, the listing realtor was very happy with this &#8212; she would only have to deal with me, and not multiple offers. The viewing was set for noon today.<br />
With a good night&#8217;s sleep behind me, I was prepared for another day of negotiation and kicking the baseboards. Around 10:00 this morning, I got a call from Robyn. I figured she was calling me to make sure I was ready for the viewing. Little did I know what else she had to tell me.<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got good news.&#8221;<br />
I had a mental pause, where I wondered what that news could possibly be.<br />
Remember the house I lost the bid on last Saturday? Well, it seems that the people who had won the bid had put on a rather odd condition on the sale. I don&#8217;t remember what it was off the top of my head, but it was unconventional, very vague (to the point where Robyn said that she would never use the condition), and basically allowed the buyers to back out if they got cold feet.<br />
It seems the people who won the bid need to wear thicker socks.<br />
To avoid the problems of competing offers again, the listing realtor of the &#8220;first house&#8221; (as it came to be known) decided to give me first right of refusal, if I so desired. I desired. So instead of one house to potentially purchase, I now had two.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop giggling for most of the morning. Most of the people I told this to just gave me strange looks.<br />
So just before noon, Chris, Robyn, and I ventured over to take a look at the &#8220;second house&#8221;. We couldn&#8217;t get back into the &#8220;first house&#8221; &#8212; I wanted to let Chris have a look &#8212; but luckily I took pictures the last time I was there.<br />
The listing realtor of the &#8220;second house&#8221; was there to meet us, and defend us from the two tenants who lived there (it&#8217;s not owner occupied). It seems the tenants are quite angry that the owner is selling the home, as they&#8217;ve lived there for quite a while and are really attached to it. (My general opinion &#8212; if you like it that much, buy it. If one person (e.g. me) can afford it, two people should be able to.) The realtor wanted to stick around inside, assumedly so I couldn&#8217;t escape without signing onto the deal.<br />
The kitchen was not as nice &#8212; the work was good, but I think it lacked style. The basement seemed even more cramped than its neighbour (but it was also more full of stuff), the upstairs was well finished, although the bathroom was not nearly as nice, and the floor seemed to have a noticeable slope to it.<br />
I was convinced there that this wasn&#8217;t what I wanted. Robyn suggested we go outside and look around back. I&#8217;m not entirely sure this was as a double-check, or just so that she could get me past the listing realtor without signing anything and she could tell that realtor that I wasn&#8217;t going to purchase after all. (By that point, the listing realtor had 12 calls about the house, so it wasn&#8217;t really going to put her in a bind, and the sellers would likely get more for the house in the long run.)<br />
With the purchase withdrawn, we returned to the office to put the offer back in again on the &#8220;first house&#8221; &#8212; the one I wanted. So once again, I scribbled my initials and signature to a series of sheets I&#8217;ve gotten to know quite well. Once again, Robyn made the calls and arranged for a presentation to the sellers. And once again, I had to wait.<br />
This time, it was almost anti-climactic. As I didn&#8217;t have anyone to compete with, I figured I was pretty much a shoe-in. I was &#8212; by 3:00pm, the offer had been accepted. Because I&#8217;d started looking for financing the day before, it was the only thing that still worried me.<br />
I need a fair bit of money to purchase this house. Although I do have a fairly large down-payment (thanks greatly to my extremely generous parents), I still need a large mortgage, and that&#8217;s what I wasn&#8217;t sure about. Luckily, because I spent two years getting all my finances straightened out, my financial situation is pretty good. But I still wasn&#8217;t sure if I could borrow the money.<br />
This little batch of nerve-wracking hell went on until about 7:30pm tonight. That&#8217;s when I got a call from Robyn. She was calling for the purpose of arranging for the home inspection (one of the two conditions, the other being financing, that have to be fulfilled). She asked me how I was doing &#8212; I said I wasn&#8217;t great because the stress of the financing was killing me. I didn&#8217;t want to lose this house a second time.<br />
&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re so silly!&#8221; she laughed, &#8220;You got the financing earlier this evening.&#8221;<br />
I turned around, and saw myself staring back with the same slack-jawed glare of surprise and amazement.<br />
After a loud &#8220;YES&#8221; (which would have had every head on the floor staring at me, if they hadn&#8217;t all already gone home), I finished the conversation. I think I said &#8220;yes&#8221; the entire time to every question she asked. (Hopefully I didn&#8217;t agree to something bad&#8230;)<br />
So, only one condition remains outstanding &#8212; the home inspection. That&#8217;s this Saturday. Once that&#8217;s covered, the restrictions are cleared, and the house is (more or less) officially mine. Then all I have to do is wait &#8212; the closing date is June 1. I&#8217;m just glad I&#8217;m a patient person.<br />
At least I would be, if I didn&#8217;t want everything right now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Fewer things are harder than losing a loved one. I suppose it&#8217;s even worse when you lose them slowly. And it&#8217;s only worse when there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.<br />
My father is dying. As you might recall, late last year, he beat lung cancer. What wasn&#8217;t immediately known was that when he started chemotherapy, the cancer decided it was time to hole up somewhere else. It found a new home in his brain.<br />
Brain cancer is one of the worst. Because it&#8217;s a &#8220;clean zone&#8221;, no chemotherapy will work &#8212; there are biological processes that keep those toxins out. (Though, interestingly enough, they&#8217;ll let cancerous cells in.) The cancer took hold, and started growing. While we were celebrating dad&#8217;s triumph over lung cancer, the unnoticed brain cancer was preparing for the second battle of the war.<br />
It&#8217;s a war that my father is likely to lose. When the tumour was found a month following his radiation treatment (during a follow-up CT scan), it immediately became a problem. It was almost as if the tumour knew that we knew it was there, and was bent on taking revenge for being forced out of the lung.<br />
The first thing to go was dad&#8217;s balance. The tumour was in the right place to throw that off. Steroids solved that problem &#8212; mostly. But it swelled his face quite a lot &#8212; a side effect, so he ended up looking much better off than he actually was.<br />
The last time I saw dad was at Christmas. He wasn&#8217;t the fastest moving, but he was more than capable of carrying out his Christmasy duties. No-one, really, was any wiser to what was yet to come.<br />
Only a few days after returning to Calgary, dad took a fall. Quite a bad one, and injured himself in the knee and ankle. He had to start using a walker &#8212; his lower body strength was atrophying (though his upper body strength seemed no worse). For my father, this was quite a blow, not just physically but also mentally &#8212; he&#8217;d lost his self-support. A prideful man, for him to rely on anything but himself was something I don&#8217;t think he was really ready to accept.<br />
This is common with my family. My grandmother was like this, too. My grandmother used to live in a two-storey Leaside home, until my father and aunt finally convinced her that she needed to move into a retirement home, where she could be looked after and she wouldn&#8217;t have to climb stairs. Although her mobility was fair, she could no longer smell or taste foods. It was a struggle to move her from her home of many decades &#8230; stubborn pride is a tough thing to fight.<br />
Today, I learned that despite another radiation treatment to retard the brain cancer, the disease is progressing &#8220;normally&#8221;. Although we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, the doctor is hinting that my father will live only until about Christmas.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I will do without my father. He&#8217;s always been such a wonderful source of information, and a role model that I can only dream of imitating. He tried so hard to be the perfect father, and yet there has always been a slight distance between us. I think it&#8217;s partly due to me &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the most affectionate child. The rest &#8230; well, it doesn&#8217;t matter, really. He&#8217;s my father, and I love him no matter the past or the future. This is not a year I&#8217;m looking forward to.<br />
Worse, though, is what Cathy will have to go through. Cathy is on the frontlines. She&#8217;s the one who has to deal with dad&#8217;s illness, the one who goes to the doctor, the one who keeps mom and dad going from day to day. I feel so bad because I cannot do the same. As much I would love to take the next six months off, go home and help out my parents, this I cannot do. Perhaps when I do finally find a home of suitable size, I can invite my parents to spend time out here, where I can try to care for them and take some of the load off Cathy, even if only for a while.<br />
This isn&#8217;t exactly the easiest time for all this, either. On a selfish side, I&#8217;ve got a change in my career (more management than implementation), the stress of hunting (and trying to purchase) a house, Cathy&#8217;s wedding (although I&#8217;m not doing a lot with it so far), trying to help out the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (but I&#8217;m swamped at work), and then there&#8217;s my father&#8217;s health mixed in with all of that. It&#8217;s hard.<br />
These are things I want to talk about with my friends. But what do you say? How do I not come across like someone who&#8217;s looking for attention? I just need to talk. My friends know be better than this, of course, so my problem is all with me.<br />
Right now, I can only do what Cathy does &#8212; live day to day. And hope that the doctor&#8217;s prognosis is wrong. He&#8217;s been off before, and maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; the stubbornness of the Sowrey family is enough to turn this around.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Early this year (and this month), I finally decided it&#8217;s high time I get myself a permanent address. Not another apartment, but an actual home. Something I can call mine. Something where I have my own walls, my own roof, my own hot water tank, my own hefty problems with municipal sewer service and high property taxes&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s more sobering than jumping in a frozen lake in the dead of winter (but without the sudden shrinkage of certain body parts).<br />
I&#8217;ve been looking for a little while now &#8212; I&#8217;ve been through about 30 homes so far (I&#8217;ve actually lost count &#8212; though I did intend to keep track of every one). I&#8217;m looking primarily close to downtown, currently in about a 5 kilometre radius around Calgary Tower. So far, I&#8217;ve found a number of places that come &#8220;close&#8221; to what I want.<br />
What do I want? Something with more character than the average crap infill or new housing development. The majority of the places have about as much appeal as week-old squirrel road kill &#8212; and generally smell about as nice. I want something much older &#8212; preferably built before 1930 (although I&#8217;ve seen a few built since then that have a certain charm). Why? First, character &#8212; they just ooze it. Second, they&#8217;re quite sturdy &#8212; some goofy building code that was in place until the 20s required homes to withstand massive earthquakes (although we live in one of the most geologically stable regions in North America) and tremendous windstorms. Third, they&#8217;re most likely to have good hardwood floors &#8212; none of this pseudo-wood flooring.<br />
Luckily, Calgary&#8217;s got lots of these homes. So finding one isn&#8217;t too hard. Finding one for sale? Well, that&#8217;s a little more difficult. And finding one for sale in Sunnyside, where I want to be, is darn near impossible. It&#8217;s a 10&#215;8 block area (roughly), and there&#8217;s about two homes for sale at any given time.<br />
Usually for about a day each.<br />
Take the one I just saw today. It was a small home (~950 sq. ft.) about a block from the river. Beautiful little place, built in 1912 and kept in immaculate shape. I liked it so much, I put in an offer to purchase. (You need to do this sort of thing when looking for home I am in the part of the city I like. The basic rule is: You snooze, you lose.) This was at 10:30 this morning, sitting in the Starbucks on Centre Street with my realtor, Robyn.<br />
(A quick aside on Robyn. I met her completely by chance while starting my search for a home while in Oakville at Christmas. I chanced across the home she and her husband are selling, for which she is the realtor. Although her home wasn&#8217;t what I wanted, it was enough to start a relationship. Since then, I&#8217;ve gotten to know this woman very well, and I&#8217;ve gotten to the point with her where we&#8217;re more a team than a client/realtor. Although she&#8217;s still in this for the money, obviously. If any of you are looking for a new home in Calgary, let me know and I&#8217;ll put you in touch with her. I&#8217;d recommend no-one else in this city.)<br />
The house was listed at $209,900. A little high, perhaps, but when you&#8217;re aiming for Sunnyside, this is almost the norm. With the offer contract in hand, she dropped me off at home and told me she&#8217;d call later in the day with news. We expected to have the offer presented around 5pm to the seller.<br />
I should point out at this time that the house has been on the market for one day.<br />
At 2:30pm, I got a call from Robyn. I had a competitor. It was time to up the ante. I&#8217;d put in my offer at $206,000. We bumped it up to $209,900. To further sweeten the deal, Robyn cut $500 from her commission. (See why I like her?) We thought this would be good enough.<br />
I continued at the office until about 4:30pm, when Robyn called again. At first she said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some good news, and some bad news.&#8221;<br />
There was a pause.<br />
&#8220;Actually, it&#8217;s all bad.&#8221;<br />
I had two more competitors. There were now four of us vying for the same home. It was time to raise the stakes again. $214,000, and Robyn cut $1,000 from her commission. We debated about removing the inspection condition, but I wasn&#8217;t comfortable with not inspecting a 90 year old home. We felt it was solid enough, and put it in. Then the wait began.<br />
At 5:15pm, I got the call. Well, not the call I&#8217;d expected &#8212; Robyn just told me that I had to wait until after 6:00pm before the decision was made. My offer expired at 6:30pm (according to the contract), so I was getting a little anxious. And Robyn didn&#8217;t know what was going on &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t offer me more information than what I already knew. We had to wait.<br />
And wait.<br />
And wait.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t concentrate. This was just annoying. And frustrating, because there was nothing I could do anymore. All I could do was trying to push through the work I had and try not to think about the fact that there was someone negotiating my finances to try and buy me a house, while taking a pay cut herself to do it.<br />
Did I mention I really like Robyn?<br />
Anyway, I got &#8220;the call&#8221; at just after 6:30pm. I could tell by the tone of her voice that we had lost out. Apparently there was still a counter offer going on, but we weren&#8217;t in the running anymore. As it turned out, I came in a &#8220;close second&#8221;, and was &#8220;neck in neck&#8221; with someone else. Neither Robyn or I know what happened yet, but we&#8217;re dying to know how we got beat out.<br />
So the hunt resumes. This is the second house I&#8217;ve put a bid on (I did one earlier this week, but the price couldn&#8217;t come low enough to meet what I could afford), and it won&#8217;t be the last. But it&#8217;s going to be nasty, particularly in Sunnyside. It&#8217;s a cutthroat, dog-eat-dog market right now, and Sunnyside is where everyone wants to be.<br />
I&#8217;m going to rely a lot on Robyn to find me a place. It&#8217;s going to be hard, because I&#8217;m a picky SOB. But I know what I want. The tricky part is getting it, especially with all the competition that&#8217;s out there. It&#8217;s too bad there aren&#8217;t other ways of settling the problems of competition. Personally, I&#8217;ve got a great one:<br />
The first rule of Fight Club is&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is nothing so responsible, so adult, as trying to buy a house.<br />
Okay, there&#8217;s that kid thing, but we&#8217;ll just ignore that for the moment.<br />
I&#8217;ve decided I need a permanent address. For the last 10 years or so, I&#8217;ve been living in apartments of one form or another, and I&#8217;m tired of it. I&#8217;m tired of the rent, of noisy neighbours, of the &#8220;smell of the day&#8221;, of rent that disappears out of my hand and goes nowhere, of the desire to rearrange walls and the frustration not to able to follow through.<br />
Chris is going to Japan, that much is certain. It&#8217;s a matter of when, specifically. Best estimates are July. That&#8217;s another reason why I&#8217;m starting to look. And because I&#8217;m being really picky about where I buy and what I want, there&#8217;s a lot to deal with.<br />
For example: In my ideal world, I get my hands on a two-story home (one level for entertaining, another level for bedrooms, etc.) in Sunnyside (directly north of downtown, across the Bow River). It&#8217;s not in the best of shape (though fine, structurally) and an ideal candidate for renovation. And under $225,000 list. (Combined with shrewd negotiating and a down payment, that would put the price within range.)<br />
So far, no luck. At least within Sunnyside (not many houses are up for sale there at the moment), though there are others in the surrounding area. There&#8217;s lots around the city, but I don&#8217;t want to get too far out of downtown &#8212; no fun in that.<br />
There&#8217;s one house I&#8217;ve seen that&#8217;s been on my mind for a couple of days now. This is what I did on Saturday and part of Sunday (I spent the rest of Sunday visiting with my friend Neall, who was out in Calgary to teach a video game programming course at UofC).<br />
It&#8217;s a 1913 two-story home in Bankview, just southwest of the downtown. It&#8217;s a little on the ugly side at the moment (someone thought that teal was a good colour for a house), and in need of repairs (the front porch in particular, though most, if not all the windows need replacing). On the interior, it&#8217;s currently &#8220;liveable&#8221;. But far from its former glory. It would take about $40-45,000 to get it into good shape, and that&#8217;s a pure guesstimate.<br />
The previous owners have inflicted some pretty poor renovations on the house in years past, including covering all the hardwood floors, half-finishing a kitchen, really bad paint jobs (the moulding looks like there&#8217;s about 12 layers of paint on them) installing a loft for no real reason, and decimating the basement.<br />
That said, I think it would be a huge amount of fun. It would be a long project &#8212; I&#8217;d say at least three years (inside during the winter, outside during the summer), most of which would be saving money for the next round of tearing something apart.<br />
It&#8217;s one of those cases where I&#8217;m actually torn. Part of me doesn&#8217;t want to do it &#8212; the location isn&#8217;t what I want, and I&#8217;m a little afraid at just how bad the house might be. But on the other hand, there&#8217;s a large part of me that things this would be great experience, and a total love affair with restoring a house to good condition again.<br />
I&#8217;ve even had offers of assistance not only from my father, but also from one of my co-workers (Dennis) who used to work for a company that renovated houses. It&#8217;s not like the skills wouldn&#8217;t be available. (And I did spent the first 20 years of my life helping dad fix up the family homestead.)<br />
Well, it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m trying to do overnight. There&#8217;s much to consider before I can make up my mind. But be prepared for the inevitable website chronicling this will slice of life.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yeah, I know, the holidays are over, why the heck am I writing about it now? Simple: I got away from computers for two weeks, and haven&#8217;t had the time to write until now.<br />
Unlike last year, I spent roughly half my time here in Calgary, and the other half in Toronto. Why didn&#8217;t I just make up my mind and do one or the other? Well, I suppose I could have, but the cost of flying to Toronto for the entire time was pretty steep (go figure), and I did want to go home for a while. But because every time I go back to Ontario, I remember why I live here, I didn&#8217;t want to stick around too long.<br />
No, I don&#8217;t hate my family or friends. I don&#8217;t know what it is. I just feel &#8230; weird whenever I&#8217;m in southern Ontario. Maybe it&#8217;s the never-ending city that gets to me, I dunno.<br />
At any rate, I made the trip to Toronto *very* early on the 23rd. Originally, I was supposed to leave at 6:30 on the morning of the 23rd. However, Air Canada Tango cancelled that flight and bumped me back to 12:53am. Oh yay. How I love red-eye flights.<br />
Yes, I flew Tango. First off, it&#8217;s meant to be a low-budget airline killer. (Canada 3000&#8217;s already gone under, I suspect Air Transat might have trouble in the near future, but the real fight will come when Tango tries to dive into WestJet country.) As such, it&#8217;s as no-frills as it gets. Even the chairs show it &#8212; they&#8217;re grey, and don&#8217;t even have those fancy flaps of fabric on the headrests. Even the ubiquitous peanuts (now pretzels) cost $1.<br />
And boy, are the staff surly at one in the morning! I was amazed at the curtness of the flight attendants. Just because you got stuck with a bad shift doesn&#8217;t mean you take it out on the passengers. Welcome to the travel industry, crap happens! And the Head Flight Attendant must&#8217;ve smuggled her bong onboard &#8230; the number of times she stopped talking in mid-sentence for upwards of 30 seconds before resuming was astounding.<br />
Luckily, I slept the whole flight.<br />
Arriving at 6:30am EST was a joy. I hate Pearson International enough as it is &#8212; the parking is insane, the baggage system has to be the slowest in Canada (even despite the size), and usually by the time I get there I just want to get out of the airport, so I&#8217;m generally cranky anyway. Cathy was going insane trying to figure out where I was &#8212; the flight was a little late, and bags took nearly 30 minutes to come out &#8212; but finally we were off to Oakville.<br />
Neither of my parents knew I was coming in so early. They were expecting noon. However, in the interests of their sanity, I hadn&#8217;t mentioned that my flight had been rescheduled. (Next time, though, I&#8217;m not telling anyone the flight time, and I&#8217;m taking a cab.) While waiting for mom and dad to rise, I started making breakfast.<br />
And nearly burned the potatoes. Not my best outing, unfortunately.<br />
The 23rd was generally slow day. A little bit of running around, some decorating (the tree was not yet ready), and lots of chatting. The only thing that would have made it better was if it had snowed.<br />
On the 24th, we had lunch with my aunt (my father&#8217;s sister) and cousins Erica and Lauren. I hadn&#8217;t seen either of them in quite a while, and we had a ball listening to Erica&#8217;s traditional Christmas banter. Sometimes I swear Erica should be a comedienne, or at least give amateur mike night a shot &#8212; she&#8217;s certainly got the wit for it.<br />
Christmas Eve was the traditional roast ham and scalloped potatoes. For me, Christmas eve just isn&#8217;t right without them. It was also a late night for us &#8212; Craig, dad, and I were all up until almost 2:00 Christmas morning. It was going to be the start of a very long day.<br />
Christmas morning started a little early, around 9:00 or so. Coffee and Baileys (for those who drank it, I still avoid coffee) were the order of the moment. Given the hullabaloo to take place that evening, it was probably best that most of the family started to tranquilize early in the day. (Coffee and Baileys would give way to Caesars later in the morning.)<br />
Before breakfast, we gathered in the living room to open presents. In yet another tradition that seemed to have no specific beginning, I played Santa, and handed out presents around the room. It was interesting to watch people open presents when I had none. Being out-of-province, I was fortunate in not receiving much of anything (which believe it or not, I&#8217;m quite happy about).<br />
All in all, I received three gifts. The first was my grandfather&#8217;s pocket watch. I never met either of my biological grandfathers (I did have a maternal step-grandfather for many years) &#8212; they both died before I was born. My paternal grandfather died when my father was 18, and it was his watch I received. It&#8217;s a grand old piece, which my grandfather received from his parents when he was 21. We found this out by accident, when I unscrewed the back plate to find an inscription my father didn&#8217;t know was there.<br />
My second gift was a snowboard. Apparently someone had been listening a little to close to my interest in TRYING snowboarding. (I have to emphasis &#8220;trying&#8221; because someone equated it with &#8220;wanting to take up&#8221; instead of &#8220;seeing if it won&#8217;t kill me first&#8221;.) So, yes, sometime soon you can expect a lovely little tale about me breaking my tail trying to get down a mountain.<br />
The third was probably the most special of all: I got a brother-in-law-to-be.<br />
Cathy and Craig have been together for about five years (I don&#8217;t know exactly how long). They&#8217;re about as perfect a couple as you can have &#8212; after five years, they still sound like they&#8217;ve only been dating for a week. (It&#8217;s actually sickening sometimes.) Cathy has been after Craig for marriage for about a year, after Julie (an old family friend, and Cathy&#8217;s best friend) got hitched in December 2000. Craig waited until the right moment.<br />
As I handed out gifts, I picked up three identically-wrapped, but different-sized, boxes. One was obviously a ring case, one was about the size of a large brick, the largest the size of a shoe box. None were labelled, but Craig indicated they were for Cathy.<br />
My sister lunged at the ring box. Instead of a ring, however, she found a note that read: &#8220;Birks was sold out of everything, and all I could get was this box.&#8221;<br />
Cathy, fortunately, has a very good sense of humour.<br />
She opened the largest one next. Under the wrapping paper was, in fact, a shoebox, upon which Craig wrote &#8220;This is not a sweatshirt, this is a remote control&#8221;. (The running joke the night before was that Craig was getting Cathy a remote control for Christmas.) Inside was a sweatshirt.<br />
On to present #3. This was an electric toothbrush, something Cathy wanted for a while, so I gathered. But wedged inside the styrofoam packing was a slender silver ring. I don&#8217;t think I even heard Cathy say &#8220;yes&#8221;.<br />
A note on that ring, by the way. It&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s mother&#8217;s original engagement ring &#8230; with a couple modifications. (After my grandfather died, someone (we don&#8217;t know who) turned the ring into a dinner ring.) But with a resetting, the ring will be Cathy&#8217;s.<br />
Following our rather emotional moments by the fire, we ate breakfast (my father&#8217;s secret recipe for pancakes) and started to prepare for dinner. We were having a lot of people over, and it was going to take a while to get all the food ready. It was going to be a dinner to remember.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t remember the last time the entire Robinson family had come to my family&#8217;s home for Christmas dinner, but I&#8217;m willing to take a bet on about five years. It&#8217;s certainly been at least that long since we were all together at the same time, only now both Mark and Julie are both married (their spouses were also in attendance). In fact, it was the first time the Sowrey family was outnumbered at its own table. Also there was another relative, Brian Hogg. (The Hoggs are a couple branches over from the Sowreys, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly where or how.)<br />
Dinner began shortly after 4:00pm, when guests started arriving. Dinner was still being prepared (when you make a full roast turkey and a full roast beef dinner, you need two kitchens), which gave everyone else a chance to catch up with one another. We wouldn&#8217;t eat until about 7:00. And eat we did&#8230;<br />
A few helpings, lots of dessert, and perhaps a little too much to drink, and we were already to start playing games. Specifically, a game called Outburst, where the point is to try and guess all the items on a Top 10 list. It&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds. Even with topics we knew well, we never once got all 10 items.<br />
Dinner ended around 4:00am. I didn&#8217;t make it that long &#8212; I went to bed somewhere around 1am, as I knew I had to be up reasonably early (before 10am).<br />
On Boxing Day, I braved the trip into Toronto (via Go Train, what else?) to visit an old friend of mine, Mikki. She&#8217;s an old friend of mine from university who&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve been promising to visit with for ages, and it was high-time I did as I said. (I know, there&#8217;s about 20 of you who I should also visit with, some of whom have been a very long time, but I&#8217;d need at least a week for all that.) As it stands, I was supposed to meet with Dave on the following day, but I screwed up my schedules and had to cancel on him literally at the last minute.<br />
Walking in downtown Toronto, I came to realize why it is that 1) I don&#8217;t go shopping on Boxing Day, and 2) Why I try to avoid walking in downtown Toronto. I won&#8217;t even begin to describe the claustrophobia that seemed to set in when I saw the chaos in Eaton Centre.<br />
Before I knew it, I found myself at Pearson International again, waiting for my flight to Calgary. Like the flight out, this would be wall-to-wall people.<br />
It was good to be back in Calgary. Even better to be back in my apartment. Home truly is where the 50&#8243; TV and Playstation2 are.<br />
The rest of the vacation went well until Sunday, when a bad bit of Chinese took me down for a couple of days. I hadn&#8217;t had food poisoning in many years, so whatever it was that took me down was pretty strong. I&#8217;m still recovering. One advantage of it, though&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m losing all that weight I gained over the holidays.<br />
Happy 2002, everyone! Speaking of which&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Coming into work on a Friday with a hangover is one of the worst feelings.<br />
Well, coming in on a Monday is probably worse, now that I think about it.<br />
Last night was Critical Mass&#8217; annual Christmas party. This year, we held it at the Scandinavian Centre in northwest Calgary. It&#8217;s basically a large hall &#8212; we needed something that could pack in about 400 people. But that wasn&#8217;t all that would be there&#8230;<br />
Chris, Adrian, Doug, and I arrived late. Chris had to make some last-minute changes to the video on our Christmas promotion, so we didn&#8217;t get to the party until nearly 7:30. (It started at 6:00.) Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t taken dinner away yet, so we got to partake of the meal.<br />
Turkey, of course.<br />
The awkwardness of being the last people to arrive soon subsided, and we started chatting with those around us. Luckily, the last available seats were with people we knew. Not sure if they saved them for us or not, but it still worked out.<br />
The entertainment began about a half hour after we arrived. First were a couple of speeches by Jerry (our CEO, based in Chicago) and Diane (our President, based here in Calgary). Then it really began. A man walked up on stage. Didn&#8217;t know who he was, had never seen him before. He wore a Santa hat, a suit with a bowtie, and wielded an accordion.<br />
That&#8217;s usually not a good sign.<br />
Okay, accordion music, I thought, I can handle that. Then someone started talking to the crowd. It wasn&#8217;t the accordion player. I looked around, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. It was a lounge singer. A really bad, exceptionally cheesy, lounge singer. Hired to torture us. He made bad jokes, had bad hair, had really bad taste in clothes. In short, perfect for the job.<br />
At first, he just clowned around, trying to get us to accept that he was bad. Didn&#8217;t take a lot of effort. Then he switched into the next part of his act. Armed with what had to have been a premeditated choice, he pulled Dan (our Canadian Vice-President and head of the Mercedes account) on stage. To do a duet. Of Sonny and Cher. And Dan lost the coin toss.<br />
Not that Dan had a choice anyway&#8230;<br />
It got worse. After the Sonny and Cher revival, he grabbed three more people (all bald men) and had them be three of the Beatles. They sang &#8220;Twist and Shout&#8221;, and surprisingly well, I have to say. But then the coup de gras came when he found five more people (including two of our more introverted staff) to come up on stage and become &#8220;The Village People&#8221;.<br />
All in all, the guy&#8217;s act was pretty good. And we all really needed the laugh.<br />
Soon, the entertainment was over, and the dancing began. People milled, people talked, a few left early, but a large number held out to the end of the night. About 2:00am.<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have to be in until 10:00am. Even then, some still showed up late. But today wasn&#8217;t a big day anyway &#8212; the office officially closed at 2:00pm MST.<br />
In other words, that&#8217;s the news, and I am outta here&#8230;<br />
To each of you, I wish the best of holidays and a safe break from your daily life. May you all have a wonderful time, and I&#8217;ll be writing more in the New Year!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When the temperature falls to -21 degrees with the wind chill, and the sky dumps 15 centimetres of snow on the ground, that&#8217;s when a young man&#8217;s fancy turns to&#8230;<br />
Revenge.<br />
Some months ago, Chris&#8217; and my collective birthday to be exact, our friend Teak decided that he would give us each a small token of &#8230; well, sugar. Specifically, a lunchbox full of it. When I opened my little gift, candy spilled all over my desk. How he managed to get the candy in there and the lid shut is beyond me&#8230;<br />
Needless to say, when word of Teak&#8217;s birthday came roaming around, Chris and I started thinking. Initially, it wasn&#8217;t anything mean or nasty, but then Chris joked about getting even with Teak for the months of sugar. (I still have some of mine.) It wasn&#8217;t too long before the joke turned serious, and it was time to execute.<br />
Step 1: The plan.<br />
This was perhaps the easiest part. The basic principle was sound: Get one of Teak&#8217;s desk-side cabinets (they&#8217;re a little over two feet tall, about one and a half feet deep, and a foot and a quarter wide &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a ruler, so these are estimates). Empty it. Then refill it. With candy. The trick, of course, was to do it when Teak wasn&#8217;t around (he&#8217;s been in the office late a lot, so working around that was a bit tricky).<br />
Step 2: The supplies.<br />
Sugar. And lots of it. In short, a trip to Costco, about the only place we can get such huge quantities of glucose goodness without completely breaking the bank. There&#8217;s a lot to consider when buying for a stunt such as this. You don&#8217;t want full-sized chocolate bars &#8212; they&#8217;re too big. Halloween ones would have been perfect, but those haven&#8217;t been in the stores for almost a month. You also have to be careful not to get too much of one thing. For example, too many M&amp;Ms, although perfect for something like this, means you need more of them. Also, you want variety.<br />
This meant we had to carefully choose our ammunition. I wish I&#8217;d remembered to bring the list of things we bought, but it&#8217;s along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four boxes of sour gummies (including cherry and watermelon flavours)</li>
<li>Two small tubs of more sour gummies</li>
<li>One tub of marshmallow rats (yes, rats)</li>
<li>One large tub of sugar lollipops</li>
<li>One small tub of Chupa Chups (lollipops)</li>
<li>One box of Blue Whales (gummies that taste like those blue freezies)</li>
<li>A couple packages of marshmallow peaches</li>
<li>Two huge bags of M&amp;Ms (peanut variety)</li>
<li>Two bags of Jelly Belly jelly beans</li>
<li>One container of candy necklaces</li>
<li>One tub of Double Bubble gum (the ones with Bazooka Joe comics)</li>
<li>Three boxes of chocolate and caramel Rice Krispie squares (about the healthiest thing we threw in)</li>
<li>One large bag of Werther&#8217;s (sp?) caramels</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more, but we were having too much fun shopping for this stuff.<br />
Step 3: The prank.<br />
I was in the office again this weekend, partly because I had some work to do, partly because I&#8217;m overhauling my personal website (coming soon to a URL near you), and on Sunday, because I had to know when Teak wasn&#8217;t here anymore.<br />
Around 6:30pm, I took a short trip upstairs. First good news: Teak wasn&#8217;t there. Second good news: Neither was anyone else. Best good news: The poor fool had left his cabinet unlocked. A little after 7:00, Chris called to say he was ready to have fun. I whipped over to the apartment, picked up my roommate and brother in mischief, and returned to the office.<br />
The security guard was puzzled to say the least when we walked in with two huge boxes overflowing with packages of candy. We went upstairs to the Creative Services floor, and found that the lights were still off. (I&#8217;d turned them off when I&#8217;d inspected the floor earlier.)<br />
The first thing we had to do was clean out his cabinet &#8212; the lower part, anyway. Teak had a lot of files, which would of course get in the way when trying to empty the various tubs, boxes, and bags. Fortunately, there are other cabinets which weren&#8217;t in use. A simple transfer, and we were on our way.<br />
Almost &#8230; first, we had to line the lower bin with waxed paper. We didn&#8217;t want to make a total mess.<br />
Then came the fun part &#8212; filling the drawers. Taking several containers, we started pouring. Mind you, this isn&#8217;t some random thing &#8212; you have to do it carefully. You don&#8217;t want to make a parfait of candy &#8212; you want a nice, even dispersion. We had to mix a few times to get the right distribution. But the end effect looks &#8230; nasty, actually, and the smell&#8217;s quite powerful.<br />
Filling the lower drawer, we proceeded to the upper drawer (filling it with mostly small stuff, including M&amp;Ms, and finally the top bin (which sits under the seat), also nice and full. The surprising part was that we&#8217;d had leftovers. We&#8217;d originally thought we didn&#8217;t have enough, and worried that the joke would only be partially realized. But &#8217;tis better to have too much and do the job right than not have enough and do a half-assed job.<br />

The final touch was on Teak&#8217;s computer. Like most of our Designers, he has two monitors (one is usually for seeing the artwork, the second for all the tools). Chris made up two images that were placed on the backgrounds of each of the monitors. One read &#8220;Sugar is sweet.&#8221;, the other &#8220;Revenge is sweeter.&#8221;<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop giggling the entire time. I so wanted to put up a camera and videotape Teak&#8217;s arrival this morning. I so wish I could have seen the look on his face.<br />
Ah well, all&#8217;s well that ends well. At least until Teak tries to up the ante. If he&#8217;s smart, he won&#8217;t &#8212; starting an arms race with us is &#8230; foolish.<br />
All I can say is: There&#8217;s always room for&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are times when I wonder if I&#8217;m slightly psychic. Every time it happens, it gives me the willies. This was one time I sincerely wished I was wrong.<br />
Since long before the trip with 6060, I&#8217;d had this feeling, thought, dream, whatever you want to call it, that one of our engineers was going to die somewhere around Jasper. Most of the engineers are old &#8212; well into their 70s, and after a lifetime of working in coal dust, smoke, soot, and grease, probably not as healthy as they could be. (That said, they certainly look healthy.)<br />
In my foresight, I had believed that Harry would fall ill and die during the trip. In that respect, I was wrong. However, my mortal prediction still came true. On Sunday 28 October, at approximately 10:00 in the morning, Tom Arnott suffered a cardiac arrest while sitting in the crew car. Although there were other crew present, and 911 dialed almost immediately, the arrest was severe. Paramedics worked to save his life, and he was believed to have stabilized at Jasper Hospital some time later. But the damage was too far gone. I didn&#8217;t know at the time (I had to leave for home, and heard the news only 20 minutes ago), Tom never recovered.<br />
Tom was an ex-CN engineer, and had lived in Jasper quite a long time. Harry and Tom had known each other for many years, Harry&#8217;s son Cameron had regularly gone to Tom&#8217;s house to visit. Like Harry, Tom had surrounded himself with the railroad, even after retirement. Tom spent the last few years working with Alberta Prairie Steam Excursions, as one of the lead engineers on #41. Tom was also a secondary on 6060, and had fired the engine from Edson to Hinton on the trip.<br />
Tom was a kind and gentle man, loved by many, disliked by very few. Like other old hoggers, he had many stories of his life on the rails. Now, those stories can only be told by those who had heard them before.<br />
The light in the firebox is out, and the boiler gone cold. Old engineers never die, they just run out of steam.<br />
Farewell, my friend.</p>

What many people everyday call work, I call relaxation.<br />
While I would love to sit here and type out every single little excrutiating detail, I&#8217;m going to spare you the agony and cover only the highlights.<br />
1) Vancouver<br />
I went to Vancouver on 18 October for, of all things, a party. Radical held it&#8217;s 10th Anniversary celebrating its success over the years. As a former employee, I was invited along to partake in the festivities.<br />
In addition to seeing friends I hadn&#8217;t seen in a few years, and making a few new acquaintances, I tried to remember why I&#8217;d left Radical two years ago. I still haven&#8217;t been able to give myself a suitable answer.<br />
2) The Great Train Trip<br />
Returning to Calgary on the Friday (19 October) &#8212; I flew &#8212; I proceeded to pack and prepare for Phase II of my vacation: Helping run 6060 on its biggest excursion in years. We were going to run it all the way to Jasper.<br />
This has been Harry&#8217;s dream for many years, taking 6060 back to his home town in celebration &#8212; and bring it in under it&#8217;s own power. This was something we&#8217;d been preparing for most of the summer, and we (there were up to 16 of us helping to run the train) were anxious.<br />
It started with a quick run to Stettler from Warden. There we found our mechanical glitch for the trip, which was quickly fixed. Then on to Red Deer, where we turned around and headed north to Edmonton. A stopover to pick up rail cars, we were off to Edson, Hinton, and ultimately, Jasper.<br />
I drove the entire way, chasing the train, taking pictures and shooting video footage. It was a wild ride, and my poor car had to endure the worst punishment any K-car should ever be subjected to.<br />
I&#8217;m going to bronze that car when it finally dies.<br />
The trip ended, for me anyway, in Jasper. Although there&#8217;s still the return leg and the winterizing of 6060, I&#8217;ll be trapped here in the office. The season is now officially over. Work won&#8217;t start again until January, which is fine with me. It&#8217;ll take that long to edit the movie.<br />
Why the shortness of detail? Simply put, I&#8217;m writing this one out in detail, and it&#8217;s going to take a while. When it&#8217;s up, you&#8217;ll know&#8230;</p>

		<p>Most of you know how hard it is sometimes to catch a train. Sometimes you&#8217;re running late, or the train&#8217;s early, or your watch stopped and you&#8217;re not really sure what time it is &#8212; any number of a dozen reasons why you&#8217;d be running your heart out trying to get there before you hear: &#8220;Stand clear of the doors, please.&#8221;<br />
Imagine trying to catch a train for two days. That&#8217;s what I did this weekend&#8230;<br />
Okay, so I wasn&#8217;t trying to ride it, but keeping pace with it was something else, I&#8217;ll tell you.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, I had meant to write this earlier this week, but after what happened on Tuesday, I hope you can understand why there&#8217;s a delay.<br />
Most of you probably don&#8217;t know that I went back to Toronto on the weekend. It was a little longer than the whip-in/whip-out trips I usually do for such things &#8212; normally I fly out Friday evenings and fly back Sunday evenings, but I took two extra days this time. Work has been stressful, and this was a more special event than normal, so I wanted to take my time.<br />
The event was the wedding of perhaps my oldest friend, Mark Robinson. How old? Well, let me put it to you this way &#8212; many people can remember, at least vaguely, when they first met someone. I don&#8217;t remember when I met the Robinsons. Our parents met about 30 years ago. My mother and Mrs. Robinson are best of friends (we&#8217;ve often joked about putting in a dedicated phone between the two houses). We used to have Christmas and New Years dinners together. It&#8217;s a long, sordid history.<br />
Mark, his sister Julie, my sister Cathy, myself, and two other neighbourhood kids, AJ and Kelly, made up the neighbourhood mob. We played baseball (with tennis balls), swam, help mini-Olympics, and generally raised a ruckus around the blocks. Mark was generally the ringleader, being the oldest of us &#8212; me being just shy of two years younger.<br />
When Mark was enrolled in Appleby College in Grade 4 or 5 (can&#8217;t remember which), we started seeing less of him. When Grade 9 rolled around, he stayed at Appleby nearly all the time (it was a requirement). Then came university, and I saw less of almost everyone. Over the years, separation was inevitable.<br />
Cathy, on the other hand, stuck to the Robinsons like glue &#8212; Julie still being one of Cathy&#8217;s best friends. As a result, Cathy got to know Mark&#8217;s friends from Appleby and university. (The keg parties were talk of legend after a while.)<br />
When news of Mark&#8217;s engagement came around last December, I felt like I&#8217;d missed something. About 15 years, to be exact. Once upon a time, I&#8217;d looked up to Mark &#8212; he was my role model as a child. He was strong, brave, and a natural leader. Sure, we had our disagreements (most friends do), but overall I still admired him. News of the engagement drew pangs of regret &#8212; I&#8217;d stayed away so long, I&#8217;d missed watching one of my friends grow up. I barely knew the person I had once aspired to be. I didn&#8217;t even know his fiancée, Darla.<br />
So needless to say, I was quite happy to hear I would be invited to the wedding. I had missed Julie&#8217;s wedding (I couldn&#8217;t afford the flight to Antigua from Calgary at the time), but I wasn&#8217;t about to miss another Robinson wedding. So I booked a flight (a bit more expensive than I would have liked, admittedly) and whisked myself back to Ontario.<br />
I left Friday morning. That morning, it was 3 degrees Celsius in Calgary. It would be 29 degrees when I landed in Toronto. Choosing an appropriate set of clothes to handle the change in weather was mildly difficult &#8212; I froze in Calgary, and boiled in Oakville.<br />
The wedding was on the Saturday, and would be the first one I&#8217;d been to that started in late afternoon (4:30). It was a little odd, because it meant I was idle for most of the morning. So naturally, there was a massive rush around 3:50 to get everyone together and out the door so we could make it on time. As Appleby College is in Oakville, it was a quick trip over.<br />
The ceremony was in Appleby&#8217;s chapel, an old ivy-covered building designed in the traditional British school chapel style, with pews running perpendicular to the altar, rather than parallel. It was also traditional in that it had no air conditioning. Although my new suit is much lighter than my previous ones, it was still very warm. Most people were sweating profusely (I can only imagine what Mark and Darla must&#8217;ve felt like).<br />
It was a large affair &#8212; about 150 people (that&#8217;s a complete guesstimate, I have no idea really how many people showed up). The wedding party had four people apiece. Family was everywhere.<br />
Being an Anglican ceremony, it was quick. A few quick words, the odd speech, and in 15 minutes, we were back outside. Although still 30-odd degrees, it was cooler than inside, and had a breeze. We stood around, took lots of pictures of the newlyweds, before heading off back home for a quick stop.<br />
Then it was off to downtown Toronto, and the reception at the University of Toronto&#8217;s Hart House. Hart House (just west of Queen&#8217;s Park) is one of UofT&#8217;s oldest buildings, constructed in the late 19th century. It&#8217;s built in the London gothic style, and provided an unbelievable backdrop for the wedding. Mark and Darla had provided for their guests lavishly &#8212; oysters on the half-shell, smoked salmon, and an open bar with nearly unlimited supplies of excellent red and white Henry of Pelham wines. (Two of their wedding party &#8212; a married couple &#8212; run the vinery.)<br />
And that was just the pre-reception. Dinner was yet to follow.<br />
After another round of pictures in the Hart House courtyard, we moved indoors to the grand Great Hall for dinner. I was seated with my parents, the Robinson&#8217;s, and their relatives (not all of them, anyway), right in front of the head table. Mr. Robinson gave his speech in typically Mr. Robinson style (a combination of dry wit, bad jokes, and the odd bout of seriousness), followed by speeches by the best man (Brent) and maid of honour (Darla&#8217;s sister, Jillian).<br />
Then dinner was served.<br />
Wow.<br />
I can&#8217;t really think of anything else to say, but &#8220;wow&#8221;. It was an amazing meal &#8212; Mark and Darla, unfortunately, had a reputation to uphold (started with Mark&#8217;s keg parties), and they had to deliver. They did so in exceptional style and taste:<br />
The appetizer was roasted butternut squash soup with fresh rosemary with a dollop of low fat maple yogurt. It was followed by baby spinach leaves with toasted pecans, strawberries, and crumbled Stilton cheese with an apple-Dijon dressing. Eyaa. The entree were medallions of beef tenderloin (the &#8220;medallions&#8221; were huge &#8212; the size of coffee cups) with roasted shallots in a port reduction. Yowza. Dessert was fresh fruit with a warm triple sec sabayon and a crisp wafer. Topped off with a small glass of Late Harvest Vidal dessert wine.<br />
My tastebuds were in Heaven.<br />
I was one of few who actually ate everything. Most people couldn&#8217;t pack it all back. Their loss &#8212; the dinner was outstanding. Although it did take a while to digest.<br />
Mark and Darla seemed to hardly eat. They spent a good chunk of time visiting the tables, seeing the people they invited, and being the quintessential hosts. They made brief trips back to the table for bites of food, but spent most of the their time walking around. Their only other interruptions were for kisses.<br />
Goofy tradition, that kissing thing. Never understood that. But things were different here. No tinking of glasses. This round involved answering trivia questions, kept in balloons that had to be popped before a question could be answered. (I presume this was to prevent people from looking at a question and then backing off if they didn&#8217;t know the answer &#8212; the popping balloon put the people at centre stage.) I was impressed with myself &#8212; I actually knew most of the questions about Mark. I felt a little relieved that I hadn&#8217;t drifted so far away.<br />
After dinner, it was time for Mark&#8217;s speech. (He spoke for Darla as well &#8212; I guess she didn&#8217;t want to make a speech herself.) It started off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m married &#8230; and she&#8217;s <em>hot</em>!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark&#8217;s speech used humour, history, and few tugs at the heartstrings. (Julie threatened to kill Mark if he ever made her cry like that again.) Suddenly, I didn&#8217;t feel quite so distant.<br />
Dancing would have began after that, but first one little bit of housekeeping had to be taken care of. From the day Mark proposed to Darla, there had been a joke floating around, and Ed (one of the groomsmen) was to be the instrument of delivery. Originally planned for the Recessional during the marriage ceremony, it had been delayed until the end of dinner.<br />
Ed walked over to the dance floor, picked up his guitar, and prepared to play. A few of us knew what he was going to sing. As far as I knew, Darla didn&#8217;t know &#8212; which, I believe, was the point. After a quick tune, he started strumming and singing. A few people picked it up right away, but it wasn&#8217;t really until the chorus that most people, Darla included, realized he was singing Simon and Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Mrs. Robinson&#8221;. He would follow up with a U2 song, but I&#8217;m at a loss to remember which one&#8230;<br />
The First Dance came soon after. People then began to mill around &#8212; some danced, some went outdoors, and few began to trickle out the door to go home. We stuck around until closing time, somehow&#8230;<br />
Perhaps it was the drink, perhaps it was exhaustion, perhaps it was the heat &#8212; I still had trouble looking at Mark and accepting that he was married. (I still have that trouble with Julie, and she&#8217;s been married for 10 months.) It seems that the time from when I entered high school until now has just vanished. I&#8217;ve missed so much, and gained so little.<br />
Hopefully, the next 15 years won&#8217;t go so quickly.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, someone whacked the biggest kid in the yard in the back of the head with a 2&#215;4. And now he&#8217;s very, very angry.<br />
Yesterday morning, for me, was of little consequence when I got up. I was tired, mostly due to jet lag. The temperature was 5 degrees. I checked the Weather Channel at 6:43am MST for an update. Just as all hell was beginning to break loose in New York.<br />
Oblivious to all that, I resumed my morning pattern of dressing, shaving, brushing teeth, and heading off to work. I walked &#8212; using my scooter, although faster, is a little awkward in pants. Even without headphones, I heard nothing out of the ordinary. To me, it was a cool, overcast morning. Perfectly normal.<br />
Arriving at work around 7:30, I logged in, started reading email, and looked at my daily miscellany of comics. Completely unaware that anything else was going on. Just before 8:00, I headed downstairs to get my breakfast, still holding to my daily schedule. Everything seemed normal &#8212; no news, no hints.<br />
As I climbed back up the stairs, I ran into a conversation that involved two planes hitting two towers. My immediate thoughts were small single-engine aircraft hitting electrical towers &#8212; a rare, but nonetheless believable scenario. Then Evelyn, our HR manager, mentioned something about the World Trade Center.<br />
Returning to my computer, I tried to log onto cnn.com. No response &#8212; it was overloaded. I tried cbc.ca. It, too, would not respond to my requests. Then I got the globeandmail.ca &#8212; the first news was &#8230; well, it was unbelievable. News started to fly around the room with fantastic speed &#8212; those of us just finding out were obtaining new bits of information from those who already knew. Commercial jets colliding with both towers of the World Trade Center.<br />
My first impression, like many people, was of disbelief. It didn&#8217;t make sense. From initial reports and accounts, it seemed like a hoax &#8212; a very well engineered prank by a bunch of hackers that had caught mainstream media off-guard. But as I kept hunting around, things didn&#8217;t seem so perfect &#8212; especially when I found my first image at the Houston Chronicle&#8217;s website. A fireball erupting from the side of the south tower. Reality slowly began to sink in.<br />
More and more people arrived, some already knowing what had happened, some unaware and succumbing to shock. Work ground to a halt as people started to talk amongst themselves, try to get information from websites, and listen to radio broadcasts.<br />
The Pentagon had been hit; part of it was collapsing. One of the World Trade Center towers collapsed from the damage. People were jumping from windows, some on fire, some (presumably) out of sheer desperation. Another plane crashed in a lonely corn field in rural Pennsylvania. The second World Trade Center tower crumbled. Death toll estimates were going as high as 50,000.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop the shivers running up and down my spine.<br />
Many of us gathered in the Met &#8212; the only meeting room with a video device &#8212; to watch an online broadcast of the BBC to learn anything we didn&#8217;t already know. Our company president, one of our lead Art Directors, and one of our business people were in New York. We had an office in New York. We didn&#8217;t know what their status was. Thirty minutes later, a phone call from a cell phone let us know that our comrades were okay, albeit stranded in Manhattan.<br />
Work resumed slowly, and remained slow for the remainder of the day. Some people were able to concentrate, but most couldn&#8217;t. Meetings, no matter the subject, spent more time discussing the tragedy in New York than how much budget to allocate for next year (that meeting had to be taken off-site so it could be completed) or how to fix a particular problem for a client.<br />
The day was pockmarked with bits of news and endless emails of links to images and video of the crashes. Cnn.com slowly came back up over the course of the day, its site stripped of all the basic essentials of text and the most simple of images. Even globeandmail.ca and cbc.ca had to redesign their sites to remove extraneous items.<br />
I somehow managed to forge through the day, leaving around 7:00pm. I walked home quickly, wanting to get the most up-to-date information from the news. Downtown Calgary was mostly deserted. Flags were being flown at half-staff. Even the venerable Starbucks at the corner of 8th Ave. and 4th St. SW bore a sign saying it would be closed due to the tragic events, and would reopen Wednesday.<br />
Almost every channel ran news feeds &#8212; either their own, or CNN&#8217;s. Commercial-free, and constantly reporting on new events, running footage from earlier in the day, or gathering commentary from experts and laymen alike. Although I had seen some of the video of the crashes and collapses throughout the day, nothing prepared me for the full clarity of watching a Boeing 767-200ER accelerate and arc effortlessly into the south tower of the World Trade Center.<br />
We think of skyscrapers as huge, hulking, and nigh-invulnerable edifices, able to take the most punishing abuse. They&#8217;re built with modern materials, armed with the most high-tech devices. As I watched as United Airlines flight 175 slipping into the south tower&#8217;s structure like a rock thrown into a pond, I found myself feeling less and less safe in my own apartment.<br />
I find little truly shocks me. This did, far more than I ever could have imagined.<br />
Until nearly 12:30am, I flipped between CBC, Global National, ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN, trying to learn all that I could, see what really transpired. Part of me wished I had been in New York &#8212; not to experience the horror first-hand, but to help. Part of me wished I could erase it from human history &#8212; I can only imagine how children must have to deal with such an unspeakable act, and how their parents will have to explain it.<br />
One of the many phrases that was regularly quoted by many people about yesterday was: &#8220;It was like a movie.&#8221; And that is possibly the single best description for something so surreal. Something so strange, so odd, and so utterly horrific. Because only in a movie would we consider something as terrible as we witnessed yesterday.<br />
That sentiment was echoed by others. One American, quoted on one of the hundreds of web pages I read yesterday, said: &#8220;This showed us that we are truly vulnerable.&#8221; Rex Murphy, commentator for the CBC, had a similar thought: We are as open to global terrorism as any other part of the world.<br />
This is a belief that has been engrained in Western Civilization, and most strongly in North America. We, as Canadians, could look at the United States and say that their arrogance was what set them up &#8212; poking noses where they&#8217;re not wanted, saying what&#8217;s on their mind even if the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t care, showing up at the world&#8217;s doorstep with their fancy weapons dictating politics. But we in Canada were equally as shocked. As Rex Murphy pointed out, we are no longer mere spectators &#8212; as much as the American psyche was shaken to the ground, so was the Canadian belief that we, too, are invulnerable. We are as exposed and defenceless as a newborn baby to someone determined enough to do us harm.<br />
Other newscasters had their comments, thoughts, and concerns. By the time I headed to bed, tired even from the beginning of the day (let alone the rest of the day&#8217;s events), the comments were becoming more incoherent, more strained, and weary. Peter Jennings was out of energy, and fidgeting in his seat. Dan Rather looked 10 years older. Even Peter Mansbridge looked like he was trying to pull another 30-hour marathon in front of the camera.<br />
We praise our media for bringing us the most recent news as quickly as possible. Yesterday, someone put that desire to their advantage to shock a continent. I know I shall have a hard time forgetting what I saw. The media, however, is what we wanted, and up-to-the-minute horror is what we got. A chalkboard sign out in front of Darby O&#8217;Gills, a pub just down the block from where I live, put it best in three simple words:<br />
We have CNN.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another summer has come and (almost) gone. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a summer spent indoors, stuck in front of my computer (as much as it might have actually felt like that). Given, I had hoped to get out more to places I hadn&#8217;t been before, but at least I got to a couple.<br />
The weekend started with sleep. The past couple of weeks have been extremely tiring, and I needed the Saturday to sleep. I rose with ample time to get ready to go outside &#8230; to go see a movie.<br />
Yeah, I know, with all the trouble I went through to get out of the office, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be trying to go somewhere and be one with nature. Well, there&#8217;s plenty of time for that &#8212; it&#8217;s not every day you can catch a running of &#8220;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#8221; in a theatre.<br />
It was an original print &#8212; 20 years old. The colour had faded slightly, the sound and picture was a little scratchy, and even a few scenes were missing. But even with the flaws, you would have had a hard time trying to remove the grin from my face. I hadn&#8217;t felt that good seeing a matinee since I was a teenager.<br />
I also realized for the first time that there was such a thing as a &#8220;modern classic&#8221; film. I had a concern for many years that there would never been a true &#8220;classic&#8221; film made during my lifetime. Sure, there would be the big budget Hollywood blockbusters, which are all fine and dandy to watch once in a while, but are generally fluff. As I watched &#8220;Raiders&#8221;, I came the realization that it was possible. It sounds a little weird to notice something like that, but for some reason, it suddenly made the movie all the better. And seeing it without all the digital processing made it seem even more real.<br />
The day barely half-over, I opted to go for a walk after the movie. I wound my way down to 17th Avenue, where a good portion of Calgary&#8217;s downtown life normally resides. I say &#8220;normally&#8221; because it wasn&#8217;t there that day. Calgary Public Works had cut off traffic from 3rd Street to 8th Street so they could repave. The area was close to dead.<br />
Which means perfect for shopping.<br />
Okay, so I wasn&#8217;t really looking for anything in particular. But when Blockbuster starts selling off their used movies at rock-bottom prices, well, it&#8217;s kinda hard to resist. And it didn&#8217;t hurt that I finally found the perfect cheese shop &#8212; no Kraft, thank you. The most mass-produced cheese they had was from Balderson&#8217;s, which as far as I&#8217;m concerned is premium.<br />
I&#8217;m really beginning to like this city.<br />
On Sunday, I made the attempt to go to Warden to work on 6060. Although I arrived a little late (9:15), no-one was there to greet me. I had been somewhat concerned that no-one would be there. Normally, they call me and let me know if no-one will be there. Having received no such call, I figured I was safe. Dopey me.<br />
Waiting around until 10:00, I decided I was on my own, and headed off in search of something I hadn&#8217;t seen before. There&#8217;s a lot of prairie out here, and a lot to see. One example: Rowley. It&#8217;s a very small little town (population: about 10, including the dog I saw wandering down the road) nestled in the middle of nowhere. It used to have a rail line (the same one that runs from Stettler to Big Valley, before CN ripped up the rest of the line that ran all the way down to Drumheller), but now has only a railway station, three grain elevators (none in use) and some old, empty buildings.<br />
I continued down through Drumheller, and out to Horseshoe Canyon. Usually, you can wander through without seeing too many people. But on this long weekend, it was packed. (The campgrounds west of Calgary and south of the TransCanada highway were closed for fire hazard, so people had to find something else to do.) I didn&#8217;t hang around too long. I zig-zagged the rest of my way across the plains until I got home, around 3:00 that afternoon.<br />
On Monday, we met up with Stuart, Therese, and Geoff. Geoff is one of Therese&#8217;s classmates who had just returned from a year in the States on a practicum. We celebrated with the best thing going &#8212; dim sum, of course. It was an extra long one for us &#8212; nearly two hours.<br />
Following our repast, we followed the two general rituals: Buying candy in the mall next door, and then shopping. We started off on 17th Avenue, but eventually ended up at Chinook Centre to continue the spree. Oddly enough, I was pretty much the only one who bought anything. (Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around.)<br />
That evening, I spent my last few hours of summerly freedom wandering around in the dying light, taking pictures of Calgarians trying to get their last good burst of summer.<br />
Good thing, too. It was 3 degrees this morning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass knows how to do, it&#8217;s getting its employees horribly, horribly drunk.<br />
Last year, this was courtesy of the Getaway in Westbank (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]). However, owing to financial downturns in the hi-tech sector as a whole (and our industry in particular, following the dot bomb), we&#8217;ve had to scale back. It&#8217;s probably a good thing &#8212; &#8220;The Trip&#8221; would have set the company back $120,000. That&#8217;s two people&#8217;s salaries for the year and the cost of our new Summer Social.<br />
This year, we didn&#8217;t even leave the city. Instead, we went to a place called &#8220;Symon&#8217;s Valley Ranch&#8221;, basically little more than an over-glorified RV park. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s not *that* bad. Just that it had a lot of people wondering for a while. I think the intention was good, but I wonder if (assuming we have a Social next year) we&#8217;ll go back.<br />
My day started around 1:30pm, when I arrived at the office. (Chris would not attend the Social this year &#8212; a friend was making a short visit to town, and he wanted to spend most of the day with them. I would take the company-sponsored bus to the Social, as Chris needed the car.) Several people were already there. Already the trash talk for the Big Game was starting&#8230;<br />
Trash talk, you ask? That&#8217;s the Soccer game. We have a men&#8217;s soccer team. They&#8217;re good &#8230; not stellar, but they&#8217;ve won better than half their games this year, so they&#8217;re better than average. However, the challenge was put forth &#8212; we&#8217;ve got a lot of very active women here, too. Although not on a team, they claimed they&#8217;d whip the men&#8217;s team in a match. Part of the afternoon&#8217;s events would include a short soccer game.<br />
Although the busses (there were three of them) were to depart at 2:00 sharp, we didn&#8217;t have enough people to fill even one bus. (Our staff, regrettably, have a nasty tendency of being late, or not showing at all.) As it turned out, most drove to the Ranch (located in the northwest quadrant of the city). But those of us who took the bus were the cool ones.<br />
We finally left at about 2:15, one of the busses staying around just in case stragglers finally appeared. As our bus weaved it&#8217;s way through the downtown streets, I heard the clinking of bottles &#8212; one of the Delichte brothers had smuggled beer in his knapsack and was spreading it around. This caught the attention of Di (our company president). The bus didn&#8217;t even make it out of downtown&#8230;<br />
&#8230;before we stopped to make a beer run. Di, Jason, Philippe, and Tamara all raced down the block, returning with a couple flats of beer and a box of coolers. We were finally ready for the trip.<br />
I was admittedly a little disappointed when we arrived at Symon&#8217;s Valley. I had expected at least a couple of trees. But the northwest is much more like prairie scrubland than other parts, so I guess I shouldn&#8217;t have been too surprised.<br />
Symon&#8217;s Valley is (or at least looks to be) primarily an RV park, which sits on the west half of the lot. The east half has a gravel parking lot, a pair of softball fields, and the buildings. The buildings are primarily a ring of ramshackle facades, made to look like an old western ghost town &#8230; or at least look like they were built to look like an old western ghost town. For all I know, they&#8217;re falling apart and no-one&#8217;s fixing them.<br />
The main portion is the mess hall, which can accommodate our large numbers (probably one of the reasons why we went there) and a small bar. The entire motif is western, of course, which means a lot of wood, and a lot of kitsch. But what fun is a faux western ranch without kitsch, anyway?<br />
The bar, of course, was free. That took us about five minutes to figure out. It was unlimited, too. Also a bad thing. We had four days of drinking to make up in a few short hours. (Or at least that was the resounding belief.) We got started as soon as possible.<br />
Around 4:00, the call for the Big Game began to circulate. It was time to find out who got bragging rights for the next year. (And believe me, it would last that long.) The Ranch emptied out onto the softball fields &#8212; the only place big enough for a game. Although there were no goal posts or lines on the field for soccer, a few plastic markers would define the field of battle.<br />
The men were already out, changed into their near-luminescent orange shirts, and limbering up for the game. With Survivor&#8217;s &#8220;Eye of the Tiger&#8221; playing, the women&#8217;s team raced onto the field, ready for battle.<br />
The game was a shortened one &#8212; normally an hour in length, this game ran only 40 minutes. The rules were also bent a little more &#8212; six men versus 14 women. Yes, slightly different odds, but you have to remember that the men had been playing together all season, whereas the women&#8217;s team was thrown together about five minutes before the game started.<br />
It took a while for the women&#8217;s team to get into gear, but with the help of Carmen and Max (who lead the cheers from the sidelines), the women managed to hold the men to a 2-2 game. Bragging rights, such as they were, would be limited to the individuals that day.<br />
Returning to the hall, we proceeded to watch people attempt to ride the mechanical bull. (This was the entertainment for the adults &#8212; the finger painting and popsicle-stick picture frame making had been earlier in the afternoon.) There&#8217;s nothing more fun than watching your co-workers attempt to stay on a hydraulically-driven chunk of fibreglass &#8230; well, actually, there are lots of things more fun, just not at Symon&#8217;s Valley.<br />
Dinner appeared before too long, and we all lined up for grub. It was basically what you&#8217;d expect to see at a picnic &#8212; coleslaw, potato salad, buns, baked potatoes, but we also had roast beef and roast chicken. The beef was a little overdone, but nothing to make it really bad.<br />
Before long, the announcement came &#8212; it was time to board the busses again. Our time at Symon&#8217;s Valley was over and we had to go home. It seemed almost a waste that it was only 8pm.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought that.<br />
As I approached the busses, Eryn informed me that one bus was going to Critical Mass, the other bus was going to Di&#8217;s house. Upon querying the destination of the second bus, I learned that Di had decided to invite a whole mess of people over for a post-picnic get-together.<br />
Most of us boarded the party bus.<br />
Di wasn&#8217;t there when we arrived, but Phil (her husband and one of our copywriters) was onboard, and so let us in. I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure if Phil had been aware of the ensuing party &#8212; but he seemed to be keen about it anyway. We were settled barely 10 minutes when Di, Laura, and Mel pulled up with the beverages.<br />
Flats of beer. 24 cans to a flat. 15 flats in total. (Did I mention that Di&#8217;s our company president?)<br />
My exact words: &#8220;Ooh, it&#8217;s gonna get ugly.&#8221;<br />
The next five hours were a bit of a blur. I don&#8217;t remember entirely everything that happened. But generally, silliness and stupidity abounded. My camera started making the rounds, carried and operated by others, so I still managed to get a record of the ensuing mayhem.<br />
I bailed out around 2:30 in the morning, though I can&#8217;t say with exact certainty. I was drunk. Very drunk. The party continued until the wee hours of the morning, when the cops finally showed up to shut everything down. A true sign of a good party.<br />
Needless to say, following Saturday&#8217;s debauchery, I&#8217;ll not be doing any celebrating any time soon. It takes a lot of energy to do all that, and after a weekend like the one I just had, I&#8217;ll need a little time to recuperate.<br />
Besides, I still have a hangover&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have a new girlfriend.<br />
She&#8217;s a little temperamental, though. She gets hot really fast, she&#8217;s always blowing steam, and at the moment has a nasty tendency to run around mostly naked.<br />
That, and she weighs 637,540 pounds.<br />
Yes, I too have succumbed to the wiles of the Iron Mistress. I suppose it was only a matter of time. Hanging around the 6060 work crew probably doesn&#8217;t help matters, either.<br />
Saturday was yet another trip for me out to the middle of Nowhere, Alberta (also known as Stettler). You&#8217;d think that with only a few measly hours of sleep that I&#8217;d have an awfully hard time trying to pull my butt out of bed early Saturday morning.<br />
You&#8217;d think.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing sometimes what willpower can do. That and a good bout of adrenaline. I was in a hurry. I had to be in Stettler by around 9am, and I was already 30 minutes late (I&#8217;d slept through my first alarm).<br />
The trip up was nothing out of the ordinary. Drive Highway 2 to south Red Deer, fill tank with gas, take route 595 east to Highway 11, and then to Highway 12, which takes me right into Stettler, and right to the Stettler train station. I&#8217;ve done that route a couple times &#8212; it&#8217;s quite nice &#8212; and aside from a bit of traffic (road construction) it went pretty quick.<br />
On 20 July, CN 6060 was supposed to do a run from Stettler to Big Valley (and back). Although it had been ready to do the run, the safety coordinator for the rail line had forbid 6060 from running on the line &#8212; the ballast (what holds the tracks in place and defines the rail bed) was too light in some places.<br />
So when I arrived at the station, all I found was #41 &#8212; Alberta Prairie&#8217;s 1920 Baldwin Consolidation 2-8-0. It&#8217;s a small steam engine &#8212; a scant 62 feet long (6060 is one and a half times longer) and a piddily 244,000 pounds (6060 is over two and a half times heavier). It&#8217;s a nice little engine than can, but it&#8217;s not the one I was looking for. I found 6060 still in Warden, having been denied the run.<br />
On Saturday morning, I was not disappointed. As I drove along (having to take a detour due to road construction), I caught a glimpse of a now very-familiar huge black and green locomotive sitting next to the Stettler station. Already, Harry, Ernie, and Don were hard at work.<br />
This was the second day in a row that 6060 would run, having run also on the Friday. Like most days 6060 runs, the train had been packed &#8212; over 400 passengers. The anticipation of a large crowd was high. So there was extra pressure to make the train look (and run) as well as possible.<br />
Donning my now very grubby jeans, I leapt at the chance to do whatever I could. So I got handed the jobs of helping Don grease the tender&#8217;s bearings (managing to get quite a bit of grease on myself in the process), and wiping down all the trucks (the non-powered wheels) and the drivers (powered wheels) on the engine. My hands were literally soaking in Varsol for about two hours. Ouch.<br />
Barely a half hour after I arrived, it was time to get 6060 fired up. Because the insulation and jacket are still not back on (barely the first quarter of the boiler is covered), it cools off very quickly &#8212; there was barely one pound of pressure in the boiler that morning (6060 operates at 250 pounds of pressure).<br />
I&#8217;d always wondered how you start a steam engine. It&#8217;s not like starting a car &#8212; there&#8217;s no key, there&#8217;s no electricity, and there&#8217;s no motor. In fact, starting a steam engine cold is quite a challenge, and not easily done.<br />
The primary problem is draft. Like all fires, you need a draft to keep the fire burning. The problem with steam engines, particularly ones as long as 6060, is getting the draft started. For that, you need an air compressor. A big one.<br />
The air compressor does two things: It charges the blower air tank, and it&#8217;s used to create the draft in the stack. The blower atomizes the Bunker C crude oil we use for fuel, spraying it into the firebox. This allows the oil to burn more cleanly, efficiently, and creates far more heat than just pouring it in. At the opposite end of the engine, jets of compressed air shoot up the smoke stack, drawing the burned gases from the firebox, through the heater pipes, and into the stack.<br />
It sound complicated, but it really isn&#8217;t. Provided you have a source of compressed air, anyway. If you don&#8217;t, well, you&#8217;re not going anywhere. You can&#8217;t start 6060 without this handy little feature. So of course, the question is how did they start 6060 when she was operating with CN Rail&#8230;<br />
A boiler. A big freaking boiler. Every roundhouse had a boiler room, whose sole purpose was generating steam for starting up steam engines. That&#8217;s all it did. If your engine ran out of water in the middle of nowhere, you were screwed. Even if you could refill your water, by the time you got it your engine was cold. After that, you had to be towed back to a roundhouse to be restarted. And you got in trouble.<br />
Heating something the size of 6060 would take hours, or so I thought. But you&#8217;d be surprised how quickly something the size of 6060 can get hot. I noticed this the hard way, when Mitch (who showed up for a while to help fix a split steam line) called me out to the engineer&#8217;s side running board to help splice a line back together. Next to what little insulation we had on, the engine seemed cool. But once I&#8217;d passed the jacket, it felt like I was standing next to an industrial-sized waffle iron.<br />
It didn&#8217;t help that I was on the sunny side of the engine, either.<br />
Within two hours, steam started to trickle out of some of the various vents, ports, and exhausts. At first, it was just drops of hot water. But soon, little clouds were blowing out. The previously cold, calm engine was beginning to feel a little more dangerous. Of course, this was when I was rubbing very flammable Varsol all over the wheels right next to many of these steaming vents, under a now very hot boiler. I kept expecting one of the vents to suddenly blast open and peel my skin off.<br />
But Harry and Ernie were well aware of where I was at all times. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re engineers. They don&#8217;t open anything until they&#8217;re sure no-one&#8217;s around.<br />
By 12:00, 6060 was approaching operating pressure. Passengers for the 14:30 trip were already arriving, mostly just to watch 6060 go through its paces. While Harry, Ernie, Tom (Alberta Prairie Rail Excursion&#8217;s engineer, who was on a &#8220;training&#8221; run &#8212; no pun intended) worked in the cab, Don and I finished off work on the outside.<br />
My hands tingling from the Varsol, but otherwise done my tasks, I joined the engineers in the cab to hopefully absorb a few things about running a steam locomotive. I listened to what Harry and Tom discussed, periodically asking Ernie for explanations on things I didn&#8217;t understand. Don was learning as well &#8212; he&#8217;s a few steps ahead of the game compared to me, but he&#8217;s also been with the RMRS for 15 years.<br />
One of the most fascinating things was watching the fire in the firebox. Only a month earlier, I had stood inside it, wondering what it would be like when lit up. Now I could barely see the features, they were obscured by the orangey-red flames that swirled around. The heat was intense, but nothing 6060 wasn&#8217;t used to.<br />
By 13:00, we were ready to start the engine in motion. Grabbing my camera, I took up position and waited. For a while, nothing happened. But then 6060&#8217;s forward bell started to ring, warning all around that a very hot 313 metric-tonne hunk of iron was about to start moving. A sudden (and very loud) blast of steam shot out from the cylinder cocks, and slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, the huge engine started to move forward.<br />
I felt a tingle in the back of my next. 21 years rushed by like a summer breeze. For a split moment, I was eight again, hiding behind my father as this giant black beast came tearing down the rails in Oakville. I remembered that it had scared me, but also deeply intrigued me. It was good to feel so young again. Now I know why those who work on 6060 are always smiling, and are so young at heart.<br />
In front of 6060 was the caboose, and most of the day&#8217;s train. The rest was waiting down the yard &#8212; the train had been &#8220;broken&#8221; the night before, because a road bisects the rail yard. The train rolled down and softly linked up with the remaining cars. The linesmen hooked up the steam and brake lines, and a few minutes later, the entire train started back to switch onto the main line.<br />
The Stettler station sits on a portion of barely-used track owned by the East Central Heritage Society. It used to be a CN short line, until the Government allowed CN (and CP) to start giving up their unprofitable lines. Now Alberta Prairie Rail Excursions is the primary user of the line. So we didn&#8217;t have to worry about tying anyone else up.<br />
Because there aren&#8217;t any turntables or switch arounds, 6060 had to run in reverse for the trip down to Big Valley. For a steam train, it&#8217;s a little awkward, but almost no different than running forward. Besides, at the speeds we would be running, it was hardly an issue.<br />
Finished my current round of picture taking, I returned to the cab, to see what was going on. Harry spotted me and called me up for an impromptu &#8220;meeting&#8221;. Being the youngest, I was the designated gopher. My job was to go for ice creams &#8212; Harry was buying. Being a hot day, it also meant I had to run.<br />
There are times I don&#8217;t like the dryness of Alberta. But when you can run in jeans in 32 degree weather and know that your sweat will just evaporate, you really can&#8217;t complain too much.<br />
Soon, it was 10 minutes until departure. Although we weren&#8217;t with a real rail line, everyone was running like they were &#8212; the conductors, Harry and Ernie, even Don read off in railroad time (military time) and were synchronizing watches. Old habits die hard, I guess. With 10 minutes remaining, it was time to sound the whistle. It should have brought back so many memories of watching 6060 roar past when I was a child.<br />
Unfortunately, I was standing next to the whistle at the time, so it only succeeded in scaring the hell out of me.<br />
It&#8217;s a powerful whistle too &#8212; none of these pipsqueak little tin whistles. This is fed by 250 pounds of steam. It&#8217;s loud. Loud enough to shake you to your bones. (Don wears ear plugs when riding 6060 because the whistle&#8217;s so loud.) You can hear it for miles. Out in the open prairie, it&#8217;s a beautiful sound. Standing right next to it &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say my ears rang for a little while.<br />
At 14:30 on the nose, Harry sounded the high ball (three short blasts of the whistle) to indicate that we were off. Don and I took position in the caboose&#8217;s cupola, right behind 6060. We faced the front of the engine the whole trip down. It was wonderful to see it running again.<br />
It was so good, in fact, that I felt an urge to share the experience with the man who got me hooked on all this in the first place &#8212; my father. Through the miracles of modern technology, I called up my parents and let him listen to the chugging of the engine and the blast of the whistle.<br />
Just as we started to pull into Big Valley, the train lurched to a stop. We were nowhere near the station, but our forward progress had been retarded &#8230; by train robbers.<br />
Yes, train robbers.<br />
This is part of the whole act. The robbers come, stir up trouble, get some money, and are promptly stopped by the local sheriff. It&#8217;s a prairie thing. Of course, the sheriff, late to arrive, has no clue who lost money to the thieves, so in a kind-hearted gesture, donates the loot to children&#8217;s charities.<br />
Robbery completed, we finished the last 500 metres into Big Valley. While passengers disembarked and headed up to the hall for dinner (part of the price of admission), 6060 switched ends of the train so it could make the run back later. After she was hooked back up, Harry and Ernie did a quick inspection, and shut her down for a couple of hours, so we could go eat.<br />
You never leave a running steam engine unattended.<br />
Dinner is part of the package. It&#8217;s quite good, too, prepared by local Big Valley folks in their town hall. It&#8217;s typical fare &#8212; mashed potatoes, vegetables, roast beef (albeit a little overdone), and even has pork cutlets and shrimp. My sweat equity bought me a free trip on the train and a free dinner. Can&#8217;t argue with that.<br />
Harry, Ernie, and the two conductors (Ed and Warren) told war stories of their days on the rails. One day, I&#8217;d love to write a book about some of these &#8212; most are unbelievable (Harry can actually say he drove a locomotive through a house), the rest stop at merely hilarious. Makes me wish sometimes I was 50 years older, and an ex-railwayman.<br />
Following our dinner, we returned to get 6060 back in gear again. During the hour we were gone, she&#8217;d lost almost 60 pounds of pressure (another reason why we need to get the insulation and jacket back on &#8212; so that won&#8217;t happen), so firing her up was of big importance. A large number of people came out to look at the engine while this was going on. Don ran interference for Harry and Ernie, answering questions about 6060 and her history.<br />
Soon, 19:00 rolled around, and we started back for Stettler. This time, Don and I were at the end of the train. It was much quieter (no hulking locomotive to rattle the windows), and we could clearly hear the clickety-clack of the wheels and the barking of the engine.<br />
Yes, &#8220;barking&#8221;. This is another term I&#8217;ve learned. When a steam locomotive starts up a grade, or is hauling a lot of weight, it will chug loudly and distinctly &#8212; this is called &#8220;barking&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure where that term comes from. I have to remember to ask. (I did ask what &#8220;hogheads&#8221; were and what that etymology was.)<br />
We arrived back in Stettler around 20:30. I was exhausted, and I hadn&#8217;t really done much. There was still work to do &#8212; 6060 had to switch cars once they were emptied, the train broken, and then 6060 had to go back to Warden so we can continue working on her.<br />
But I had to get home. I had plans for Sunday, and being in Warden, unfortunately, wasn&#8217;t part of them.<br />
So for the first time in 21 years, I saw 6060 in action right in front of me. Not as impressive, unfortunately, as when I had seen her run through the Oakville sub as a child, but no less awe-inspiring.<br />
I left the Spirit of Alberta behind, but only for a few days. I&#8217;ll be back on the weekend. There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do, and a lot for me to learn. We&#8217;ll be running again on 21 September, with the jacket back in place, and hopefully with a fresh coat of paint.<br />
Hope you can all make it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I knew something was up a few months ago, when Chris told me he was going to Ontario for &#8220;a friend&#8217;s wedding&#8221;. Chris is rarely that vague. More often than not, he&#8217;ll include a name, even if it&#8217;s someone I don&#8217;t know.<br />
A month or two later, I got the call. It was Gerry, phoning long distance from Bermuda, with &#8220;big&#8221; news. Seeing as Sam (Gerry&#8217;s girlfriend) had given birth to their son Alex on March 2nd, it was doubtful the news was &#8220;Sam&#8217;s pregnant&#8221;. This was something different &#8230; they were getting married.<br />
The early secrecy was because Gerry wasn&#8217;t sure of who was going to be invited, and who wasn&#8217;t. Not wanting to hurt feelings, no-one was originally to know, unless they&#8217;d been invited. Chris and Gerry have been close friends for years (having once shared an apartment for a year), which is why he was invited early on.<br />
Chris and I were to fly out to Ottawa for the wedding. Stuart and Therese were also invited, but were conveniently already in Ontario due to another wedding. Chris was then invited to a second wedding (although it would come before Gerry&#8217;s) &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s brother Andre, who was getting married the day before.<br />
Confused? Good, most people were. (Originally, the primary wedding was Andre&#8217;s. Gerry and Sam were holding a &#8220;christening&#8221; the following day for their son. Little did most people know that the christening would be closely followed by a wedding.)<br />
Chris caught the red eye from Calgary on the 13th, arriving early Saturday morning in Ottawa. I would follow seven hours later &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel the need to get to Ottawa so quickly. My flight was mostly uneventful, seated next to a young couple and their eight month old son. We chatted on and off throughout the flight. The meal was unremarkable, though not terrible. The movie was &#8220;Josie and the Pussycats&#8221;; although I would have normally watched it, it&#8217;s not the sort of movie I want to watch at that hour of the morning.<br />
Pearson was a little quieter than the previous few times I&#8217;d flown through it, though being the middle of July probably was a contributing factor. I was to switch to a Rapidair flight to Ottawa, although someone had neglected to give me a gate at which to find my flight. Luckily, I figured out that if you followed the signs that read &#8220;Ottawa / Montreal&#8221;, they led to where I had to go.<br />
The Ottawa flight was equally uneventful. At barely an hour, it was just long enough for the flight attendants to quickly hand out &#8220;snacks&#8221; (which was a half turkey and Swiss cheese sandwich on focaccia, a cup of some strange (albeit very tasty) pasta salad, and a pair of cookies). I found it ironic that the &#8220;snack&#8221; was far better than the breakfast.<br />
Arriving in Ottawa, I found myself searching for familiar landmarks. It had been five and a half years since I&#8217;d last been to our nation&#8217;s capital, and I was anxious to see how much it had changed. The only landmark I could see under the partly cloudy skies was the NSC&#8217;s wind tunnel.<br />
Whipping through the terminal, I soon found myself in the baggage claim area, looking for my friend Rebecca. However, we managed to miss each other in the tremendous sea of people that had formed around the door. It took us nearly ten minutes to meet up, but only when I spotted a young woman who looked vaguely familiar.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d seen Rebecca had been 3 May 1996, the day that she, Stefan, Dhar, and I had returned from a break-neck tour of the United States. (Stefan and Dhar I saw a couple months later when they were passing through Oakville.) She looked only a little older (most likely due to the students she had been teaching) and her hair was much shorter with a few blonde streaks, but she looked otherwise the same.<br />
We quickly exited the terminal and headed for her car. After calling Stefan to let him know we were headed back to their home, we resumed our &#8220;how are you doing?&#8221; conversation. It was a little awkward at first. The one thing I&#8217;ve found is that when you communicate with someone through email over an extended period of time, face-to-face conversation is always a little troublesome, much like a beginner with a manual transmission.<br />
Rebecca drove us deep into the heart of Ottawa. Once upon a time, it had been much closer to the south of Ottawa. But in the last five-odd years, Ottawa&#8217;s population has exploded, and houses were in places where I only remembered farmland and forest. It was, to say the least, odd.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca are in the midst of a massive renovation (one that will be ongoing for some time). After we got resettled, Rebecca gave me the grand tour of the their home. It&#8217;s a &#8217;50s tract home built for the returning soldiers of WWII. Like most of the homes in the area, it&#8217;s undergoing a few changes. (Though none quite so drastic as the tear-down/rebuilds a couple blocks away.) When complete, I&#8217;m sure their home will be a showpiece in the area.<br />
The conversation eased up, and soon we were bantering like we&#8217;d only seen each other a month ago. As we talked, I found pictures of their children, Eric and Thea. I hadn&#8217;t seen either of them in years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen Thea since she was about six months old. Eric was only about six at the time.<br />
When Eric entered the house (at his mother&#8217;s request), he didn&#8217;t recognize me. I didn&#8217;t think he would. But after a moment, when he was told that I&#8217;d since shaven and cut my hair, there was a sudden &#8220;oh yeah!&#8221; as the light came on. Then he said &#8220;hello&#8221; and ran back out the door.<br />
*Sigh* To be (much) younger again&#8230;<br />
Stefan arrived home shortly thereafter, having spent the morning in a business meeting. It looked for a moment like Stefan and Rebecca had swapped hair &#8212; his was now much longer and (seemingly) more brown than I remembered.<br />
Conversation veered more into the technical from there, as Stefan and I caught up. This gave Rebecca a chance to start on dinner. (We had been rather indecisive with what we were going to do about dinner, so we ended up staying in.)<br />
Dinner at Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s is &#8230; interesting. The food is delectable, and the entertainment is well worth the price of admission. Eric is a natural comedian. Even though he&#8217;s not even a teenager yet, he&#8217;s well on his way to driving his parents nuts &#8230; add two spectators (Rebecca&#8217;s friend Marnie and yours truly), and the comedy just keeps rolling (especially since Marnie eggs Eric on, inadvertently or otherwise). Even Thea gets into it &#8212; most likely through influence from her brother.<br />
Following dinner, we adults decided to make a run for the bars, so we could ditch the kids for a while. Thea went to a sleepover at a friends, and Eric guarded the house. This left the four of us to find some corner of Ottawa to curl up into. But first, I was awarded a quick tour of the new and improved Ottawa.<br />
Since I last lived in Ottawa (summer 1994), much has changed. More companies have moved in, most notably JDS, a very large fibre optic company that seems to be edging out Nortel as the largest company in the area. The main facility they have there is immense, and it&#8217;s only one of several buildings JDS has in the Ottawa area.<br />
And then there are the houses. Endless tracts of houses. In places where you used to have to drive for long period of time before hitting a landmark, there are houses. Lots of houses. I don&#8217;t know what Ottawa&#8217;s population is up to now, but it was just shy of a million (Ottawa-Hull, to be precise) in 1994 &#8212; it&#8217;s gotta be pushing two million by now.<br />
After driving around for about 45 minutes, we ended up downtown along Elgin Street. I couldn&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;d been on Elgin, although it had been a very long time ago. Many of the stores I had known were gone. New ones had sprung up in their places, some were still vacant.<br />
Finding my hotel, I took a moment to drop off my things, so I could proceed gadget-free for the remainder of the evening. (Admittedly, a bit of a naked feeling, not having something with you for wireless communication or telling time.) Returning to the car, we turned onto MacLeod and drove over to Kent. My last apartment in Ottawa still stands on the corner of MacLeod and Kent. It&#8217;s still ugly, it&#8217;s still scummy, but surprisingly enough, hasn&#8217;t changed a bit since I last saw it.<br />
Much of downtown Ottawa has changed. More condos, less stores. The movie theatres are almost all gone &#8212; only the ones in the World Exchange Centre and Rideau Centre are left. Many familiar sites are gone, replaced with something newer. Even the Parliament Buildings have a fresh sheeting of copper &#8212; the distinctive green colour won&#8217;t be back for a decade.<br />
The Market, surprisingly, hasn&#8217;t changed that much. Aside from CHUM/City now occupying space in Market Mall for their radio and TV stations, the Market is almost the same as when I was last there. Some of the bars and restaurants have changed, but the atmosphere is the same, and some bars (most notably the Laff and the Dom) probably haven&#8217;t been cleaned, either.<br />
Parking in the Market, we ended up bar hopping a while, running from the Dom (where we found Dave, one of Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s many friends, and dragged him around with us), to Darcy McGee&#8217;s, to the Heart and Crown before running out of steam. I couldn&#8217;t help but remark at how much I missed being in Ottawa in the summer. It had been a lot of fun the two summers I was there &#8212; even when I had been trapped in Kanata that first year &#8212; and a part of me wanted to move back there to relive it all again.<br />
But I can&#8217;t dwell in the past.<br />
So it was with a twinge of sadness that I had to bid Stefan and Rebecca farewell when they dropped me off at the hotel later that night. I didn&#8217;t know when exactly I&#8217;d see them again &#8212; it had been over five years since the last time, which I don&#8217;t hope to repeat.<br />
I awoke a little later the following morning than I&#8217;d planned, but not enough to make us late. I showered, shaved, donned my best Hawaiian attire, and Chris and I grabbed a cab for east Nepean, and Gerry&#8217;s wedding.<br />
We arrived a little early to the house Andre rented with a few friends (at least, I assume it was a rental), but not before anyone else. Some strange people I didn&#8217;t recognize were already there. The rest were all busy getting ready for the afternoon. Gerry was one of them.<br />
He was under the crab apple tree at the back of the yard, apparently giving instructions. Being busy, there was only time for a quick &#8220;hello&#8221; before he ran off to finish whatever he was working on. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen Gerry in two and a half years, so I expected a bigger &#8220;hello&#8221;. But considering that this was his day in the limelight, I wasn&#8217;t about to say anything.<br />
Chris and I milled around for a while until others we knew began to show up. First, it was Marek and Brenda (who, along with Gerry and I, are ex-employees of Arkipelago in Toronto, where we all met), followed soon by Stuart and Therese. Before I knew it, Kathryn had arrived, with Dan in tow.<br />
The theme of the day was Hawaii. Why Hawaii? Probably because it&#8217;s an easier fashion to track down than &#8220;Bermudan&#8221;. Aside from black knee-high socks and longish shorts, I&#8217;m not really sure what Bermudan fashion entails. Either way, it meant that no-one had to wear anything truly uncomfortable.<br />
The first order of the afternoon was Alex&#8217; christening. Although born three-and-a-half months earlier, it&#8217;s a little more convenient to bring the baby to the family if the family is concentrated in a small area. Andre&#8217;s wedding happened to provide the perfect set-up for just such an occasion.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen Alex before. This was my first meeting with the young lad, but I suspect it&#8217;ll be a few years before he knows who I am. It was also my first time seeing Gerry with his son, a bit of a creepy thing too, I might add.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s gonna be a great dad. It&#8217;s just that &#8230; well &#8230; he&#8217;s a friend of mine who has a kid. It&#8217;s a little unnerving at times. A scant five years ago, most of my friends were unmarried. Now there are but a small number who aren&#8217;t either married or common-law. Soon, it&#8217;ll be only a small number who don&#8217;t have kids. You never seem to notice how old you are until an old roommate introduces you to their five year-old whom you haven&#8217;t met before.<br />
Gerry and Sam walked out with their son, quite proud to present him to a group of people, most of whom had not seen Alex outside of emailed photographs. He was bundled up in a (small) white gown, and clinging to his father. The ceremony was short &#8212; it was my first christening (not counting my own, which admittedly I don&#8217;t quite recall anymore), so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what was supposed to happen.<br />
The christening over, Sam and Alex disappeared into the house while Gerry mingled. (Gerry mingles well. Perhaps too well.) A moments later, Alex reappeared, dressed in his new Hawaiian shirt. I didn&#8217;t know they even made baby sizes, but I guess that makes sense. Denise cued some music, and to the tune of Hot Chocolate&#8217;s &#8220;You Sexy Thing&#8221;, Sam was led out by her bridesmaid across the deck, down the stairs, and up the aisle, taking a momentary pause to get into the groove of the song.<br />
The wedding itself was simple and sweet. No singing (which was beneficial, &#8216;cuz no-one really wants to hear me sing), no kneeling (which would have made taking pictures of the event a bit tricky), and there was a lot of laughter. Basically, the way a happy event should be&#8230;<br />
Gerry cried. A lot. He&#8217;s been waiting for this for years &#8212; I remember talking with him about it a few months ago, and how much he wanted to marry Sam. I guess it was his dream come true. Can&#8217;t say I blame him for being a bit teary-eyed &#8230; most people were, too.<br />
The wedding over, everyone clapped and cheered and cried, and then watched as Gerry and Sam made everything nice and legal. Almost as soon as the newly wedded (and christened) family was presented, Gerry asked Jamie to come forward for his announcement. Jamie asked Denise (Gerry&#8217;s sister) to come up to the front, where he promptly proposed.<br />
Kleenex would have made a killing.<br />
The mug shots came shortly thereafter, with various members of the now much larger family taking turns with the newlyweds and newly-engaged. I took this opportunity to introduce myself to Sam, whom I never met before. Strangely enough, my parents have &#8212; during a stopover in Bermuda while on a cruise, they met Sam when they called up Gerry. (My father had originally wanted to crash Gerry&#8217;s wedding as a surprise.) Sam seemed somewhat disinterested, but more than likely had no clue who the heck I was anyway. Besides, she probably had to meet several people that day.<br />
People started to break up into groups, where we all sat, chatted, ate, drank, and were merry. Some of us doubly so, since Gerry had made sure that the food included a whopping amount of Montreal smoked meat from Schwartz&#8217;s deli. Many of us revelled in a much-missed taste of great deli meats.<br />
As the afternoon drew into evening, the number of people slowly dwindled. Soon, there were but a few left &#8212; most of the family was now gone, leaving mostly friends. Sam and Gerry took the opportunity to start unwrapping the plethora of gifts they (and Alex) had received. I can only imagine what the crate they pack everything into will look like&#8230;<br />
After helping to clean up, word travelled around that dinner might be in order. A quick survey of the people who actually live in Ottawa (primarily Denise and Jamie) suggested that we go to Mama Grazzi&#8217;s, an Italian restaurant down in the Market. We planned to meet at 8:30, with some of us going a little earlier to obtain seats. There would be 14 of us, and Mama didn&#8217;t take reservations&#8230;<br />
Pulling teeth couldn&#8217;t be that hard. Even with six of us standing at the door of the restaurant, they wouldn&#8217;t even consider starting to move tables around for us. (Once I saw much room they had available, I was a little curious as to their initial unwillingness to help out what would inevitably be a large tip.) After about an hour of cajoling, pestering, extreme patience and a lot of &#8220;thank yous&#8221;, we managed to get enough tables to seat 14.<br />
Mama Grazzi&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the fastest restaurant in Ottawa &#8230; but the food is certainly worth waiting for. It&#8217;s almost enough to make me want to take a longer vacation there the next time I go back. Besides, it gave us a sufficiently long time to sit and chat.<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t have known that it was a wedding party. The only ones still in Hawaiian garb were those of us who came direct &#8212; Stuart, Therese, Kathryn, Dan, Chris, and myself. The rest all went back and changed. Otherwise, we looked like any other large group of people out for a good time.<br />
Dinner having ended, we all broke our separate ways. Therese and Stuart headed back to Therese&#8217;s parents place in Carp. Kathryn and Dan went back to their hotel room. The rest of us walked to the Travelodge where the majority were staying the night. There Chris and I bade farewell to Gerry, Sam, Brenda, and Marek. That pang of departure hit me again &#8212; I hoped it wouldn&#8217;t be another three years before I saw Gerry (and Sam and Alex) again. I also hope that next time I saw Brenda and Marek, it wouldn&#8217;t be at a wedding&#8230;<br />
I woke a little earlier the next morning, wanting to get a quick tour of Ottawa before catching my train. I wandered up O&#8217;Connor, and then over to Elgin before arriving at the War Memorial. I hadn&#8217;t really taken pictures of it before, and my attempts to catch the lighting of it the night before were dismal at best. It shone in the morning sun, the blue sky contrasting nicely on the cream granite.<br />
As I took pictures, I started to hear a strange sound &#8212; a marching band. At first, I thought I was just hearing things. But it kept getting louder. I looked down Elgin, only to see a full-blown regimental marching band coming up the street. At first I couldn&#8217;t figure out why &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t a holiday, it wasn&#8217;t a weekend &#8212; but after a moment, it hit me: The changing of the guard.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t seen the changing of the guard since I was a little kid, and my parents first took my sister and I to Ottawa. At the time, I thought Ottawa really dull. But unless it&#8217;s filled with cartoonish mascots and rollercoasters, I suspect a lot of kids would find Ottawa pretty dull. Heck, I know a lot of adults who find Ottawa really dull&#8230;<br />
As I walked down to see the parade go by, I heard a noise behind me that sounded vaguely like someone falling over. Normally, I would turn around. Normally, I would see if that person needed help. For some stupid reason, I didn&#8217;t at first. A moment later, I did, and saw it was an old man who was having trouble getting up. Suddenly, I felt like there was a giant neon sign above my head that read: &#8220;Here stands a callous, self-centred jerk.&#8221;<br />
The man was okay, he was quickly rescued by his middle-aged son. Didn&#8217;t make me feel any better, though. Made me a lot more aware of things around me for the rest of the day, though.<br />
I ended up racing the parade up to Parliament Hill, where the Changing of the Guard takes place. (For those of you interested, the parade enters Parliament Hill at 10:00am sharp &#8212; the bells in the Peace Tower ring almost right on cue.) Despite it being a Monday, there were people ringed all around the drill area. I stayed and watched as long as I dared, but before long (and before the ceremony was complete), I had to leave.<br />
Chris and I checked out of the hotel at roughly 11:30, right on time for me to catch a taxi to the train station. I was going home &#8212; to Oakville, that is. I was going to visit with my family for a couple of days before going back to Calgary. Normally, I would have taken a plane, and covered the distance in an hour. But I felt like I needed to continue a burgeoning tradition in my life.<br />
For two of the previous three years, I had taken a train trip on my birthday. Last year, I was so busy with work that I didn&#8217;t get to do anything interesting. So when I decided to make a side trip to Oakville on my birthday, I figured I&#8217;d do it with a little more style &#8212; I took the VIA train.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d taken VIA was when my father was living in London, selling Ford tractors and construction equipment. This was in the mid-to-late 70s. All I remember of it was the really bad TV dinner I had in my father&#8217;s apartment (the cold french fries still seem to haunt me after all these years). I don&#8217;t remember much else, except that we&#8217;d taken VIA to get there.<br />
Passenger trains in Canada aren&#8217;t what they used to be. Except in and around Toronto, where the GO Trains run on a tight schedule, you&#8217;d be lucky if your train runs right on time. But generally, if you&#8217;re going to take the train, time isn&#8217;t a big concern for you.<br />
The trip runs diagonally through Ottawa, down through several towns I don&#8217;t know the name of, through Smith Falls (where my family used to travel through on the way to a cottage on Charleston Lake), to Kingston, Gananoque, Belleville, and then into the Toronto area. It&#8217;s about a four-hour trip, provided you don&#8217;t get held up by other trains. Which, of course, we did.<br />
We got into Toronto at 5:20, about 35 minutes after we were scheduled to. After hopping off the train, I hustled into the GO lounge, got a ticket, ran onto a westbound GO Train, and continued my journey. I was in the Toronto city limits for all of about 30 minutes. My father picked me up in Clarkson and took me home.<br />
There are probably a few of you who are wondering why I didn&#8217;t call you. If I was in Toronto, it doesn&#8217;t take much to pick up the phone and call, right? That is true, but I had something else in mind, or more specifically, someone else.<br />
A couple of months ago, my family learned that my father had developed non-small cell lung cancer. A lifetime of smoking had finally done what I&#8217;d been expecting for two decades. Although I had gone home to see my family, my primary thoughts were with my father.<br />
It&#8217;s not easy living 3,000 kilometres away when you learn of something like this, even if you are expecting it. You want to be there. You want to help. You want to be the one who can make everything all right, and make the sickness go away. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to come to terms with, knowing that you&#8217;re isolated, and have to rely on others for information, and hope that everyone else knows that you&#8217;re there, even if your body isn&#8217;t.<br />
Needless to say, the family dynamic has changed a little. Instead of toddling along on our merry little way, we&#8217;re keeping an eye on things. As for dad, well, he&#8217;s in treatment, something I&#8217;m immensely proud of. Some people don&#8217;t go this route &#8212; they prefer to live as they did. But my father&#8217;s not going to take this sitting down &#8212; he&#8217;s going to do what seems to run in my family: be really, really, really stubborn.<br />
I even went with him for one of his treatments at Credit Valley Hospital. I&#8217;d heard it was more like a country club than a hospital. It&#8217;s certainly nicer than most of the hospitals I&#8217;ve been in over the past three years. And the oncology room is comfortable. It could be nicer, that&#8217;s for sure, but over all it&#8217;s not that bad. I have to credit dad for putting up with the needles, too. He&#8217;s been a human pincushion for the past few weeks. I can&#8217;t even stand getting a booster shot.<br />
The funny thing was everyone warning me about what he looked like. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t see any real change. Maybe a little older (stress tends to do that), but otherwise none the worse for wear. He looked every bit as strong as the last time I&#8217;d seen him. And I&#8217;ve never seen him eat as much as he currently does &#8212; he eats more than I do!<br />
I spent three days in Oakville with my family. Aside from close family friends who dropped by, I saw no-one else, and I talked with no-one else. It&#8217;s nothing personal, folks, but I have my priorities, and my family comes first.<br />
Because of everything I&#8217;d heard before I came home, I was a little apprehensive. But upon leaving, I knew that things would be alright. I was able to board my plane, knowing without a doubt that he&#8217;ll be in great shape the next time I see him, in early September (I&#8217;m going to Toronto for another wedding).<br />
So just to let you know, Dad, my thoughts are with you, as always. I don&#8217;t need to tell you to be strong, because you already are. I don&#8217;t need to tell you to have no fear, because you never have. Just keep following your heart and your head, and you&#8217;ll do no wrong.<br />
Some say that everything they know in life they learned in Kindergarten. I learned it from my father.<br />
Thanks, dad.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once upon a time, you couldn&#8217;t go very far out here without running into a railway. Tracks criss-crossed the land like a bad hair weave. If you had to get somewhere, you went by train. There were no highways, except for two ribbons of steel. Wherever the steel went, towns sprang up. The building of the CPR and CNR gave way to cities like Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. For over half a century, the railroads were king.<br />
Today, the lines are mostly abandoned. The main lines still run, but the short tracks are mostly gone. The plethora of grain elevators throughout the west have given way to grasslands, the old railroad beds weeded over and forgotten. The warm chuffing of Mikado, Hudson, Consolidation, and Mountain steam locomotives has fallen to the droning roar of AC4400s, SD40, and FP7 diesels. The romance is mostly gone.<br />
But not forgotten.<br />
Humanity, in a sense, is a little strange. We choose to hold onto our pasts, no matter how trivial they may seem, for we think they might be of use to the future. It is because of that sentiment that we have traditions, we keep the old buildings standing, and preserve the things we hold dear.<br />
That sentiment brought me on a sunny Monday morning to the eastern side of Warden, a small settlement about 10 kilometres south of Stettler, Alberta. Though barely a blip on the map, it is the temporary home of an aging Canadian National Railway Mountain 4-8-2 steam locomotive, number 6060.<br />
This might not seem like much, but for me it&#8217;s a trip back to my childhood. My father turned me into a rail fan when I was very young. He built me a train set one year for Christmas, which I happily played with for many years. I loved taking the GO Train into Toronto whenever possible, and enjoy riding railed vehicles of all kinds. My father was also the one who introduced me to steam locomotives, specifically CN 6060.<br />
Built in October 1944, CN 6060 was the pinnacle of Canadian steam locomotive engineering. Based on the Northern 4-8-4 design, the Mountain 4-8-2 was lighter and more versatile, but still packed all the punch of its predecessor. Still, it meant weighing in at an awesome 687,540 lbs. (today&#8217;s modern freight diesels, by comparison, are a paltry 440,000 lbs.), stretching to 93 feet in length, and rising to 15 feet and 1.5 inches in height. Today, she is Canada&#8217;s largest operating steam locomotive.<br />
CN 6060 ran from late 1944 until 1959, when diesel finally supplanted steam in Canada. Although diesel electric locomotives had been around since 1918, it wasn&#8217;t until the &#8217;50s that diesel had enough power to outweigh steam locomotives, and their high operating costs. Steam locomotives were expensive to operate, and the maintenance on them was intense &#8212; each locomotive had to be stripped down and rebuilt every five years. CN 6060&#8217;s days had been numbered since the day she rolled out of the Montreal Locomotive Works.<br />
This is when the battle to save CN 6060 from the scrap heap began. Her engineer, Harry, wasn&#8217;t about to let her fade away like so many others. With the help of CN, 6060 came out to Alberta, where she went on static display in Jasper National Park. There she remained until 1972, when CN restored 6060 to run steam excursions from Toronto to Fort Erie. This is how I came to know the engine.<br />
I cannot tell you the first time I saw 6060 roar through Oakville. My father would take us up to the CN line, along with many other families, to watch the train whip through on its way west. It was always such a rush to see a huge column of smoke suddenly erupt from under the Royal Windsor overpass &#8212; it meant the train was almost here. Dad would always put pennies on the track to flatten them &#8212; something 3/5 of a million pounds does quite nicely.<br />
One day, when I was eight years old, my father took us up to the line to watch 6060 go by. He said it was the last time that we&#8217;d ever see her &#8212; she was going west to Alberta. For an eight-year old, that&#8217;s the other side of the planet. Donated to the Province of Alberta at the celebration of its centennial, she was to return to Jasper, where she would sit idle, known as &#8220;The Spirit of Alberta&#8221;. I never thought I&#8217;d see her again.<br />
The memories of that train stuck with me, and with the popularization of the Internet, I gained a way to find out what happened to my favourite engine that could. In the summer of 1997, I tracked CN 6060 down to the Alberta Railway Museum, who in turn pointed me to Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions. Although they used CN 6060 on some of their runs, they said the best people to talk to were at the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, owners and preservers of CN 6060. It took me nearly four years, but I finally got myself in gear, and made the trip out to see an old friend.<br />
Using directions supplied by my RMRS contact Al, I found myself barrelling through parts of Alberta I&#8217;d only ever heard of. Soon I was a mere 12 km south of Stettler, running north on Highway 56. Before long, I saw a line of box cars sitting off in the distance &#8212; something Al had told me to watch for. A sign soon appeared with the name &#8220;Warden&#8221;, and an arrow pointing west. Less than a kilometre down the gravel road, I crossed a nearly-abandoned railway line. Adjacent was a dirt road, running parallel to the box cars. Although there was no sign, it seemed the logical place to go.<br />
I drove slowly, not sure if I was in fact in the right place. But as I passed an old passenger car that bore the name &#8220;Alberta Prairie Railway&#8221;, I knew I was in the right place. Then I saw a tender, the kind used by 6060 &#8212; it even bore 6060&#8217;s number. And just behind a large red engine barn sat a machine I hadn&#8217;t seen in 21 years. Her outer jacket was off, her nose cone removed, but it was hard to miss the large brass numbers on her running boards that read &#8220;6060&#8221;.<br />
Three older men met me as I walked over, the first being the man who had directed me there, Al. The other two, Mitch and Larry, were looking up under the running boards at something I couldn&#8217;t make out. Al began to tell me about the locomotive, much of which I already knew. But I was more than happy to listen &#8212; this was a man who had worked with it.<br />
Being roughly noon, it was break time. I was led around to the other side, down to a retired CN caboose, which now doubled as the yard office. It had the one thing these men really wanted: the coffee maker. I sat and quietly listen as these men told me their days on the rails. There were all ex-CN, mostly retired though Larry had a day job with the petroleum industry. They told me about the caboose, the engine, and about Harry, the man who had spent the last 42 years trying to save 6060 from decay.<br />
As I listened, I constantly looked behind me to 6060. I almost couldn&#8217;t believe that I had &#8220;found&#8221; her again. I couldn&#8217;t stop smiling &#8212; not only out of plain happiness, but also from the stories Larry, Mitch, and Al told. I was informed that these stories were nothing &#8212; were I to stick around for dinner, I really get an earful.<br />
Break over, work resumed. But first, I was permitted to wander around. Gathering up my trusty camera, I took pictures of the locomotive from many angles. Al then let me into the cab, to look at the controls and where Harry had driven 6060 for over 30 years. After taking a moment to myself, I finished taking pictures, climbed out of the cab, and returned to my car.<br />
But my day was far from over. Donning an old pair of jeans, a ratty shirt, and my shoes, I returned to CN 6060. To help work on her.<br />
The past few months has seen the outer jackets removed, lines and insulation replaced. Although the engine is scheduled to make a run on 20 July, there is still a lot of work done. And from what Al had told me through email, every hand counted.<br />
It took a very short period of time for me to realise that for all the documentaries I&#8217;d watched and the books I read, I knew nothing when it came to steam engines. I felt like a five year-old asking his daddy &#8220;why?&#8221; &#8212; I must have driven Mitch crazy with all my questions. But he, and the others, were always willing to answer the questions without hesitation.<br />
My first job was to help replace one of the lines that runs from the cab up to the front of the boiler. Although I didn&#8217;t know exactly what the line did, it wasn&#8217;t too hard to do &#8212; it was mostly lifting and holding. (Well, it wasn&#8217;t hard in the sense that it didn&#8217;t take too much brain &#8212; but it took a lot of brawn, nothing is light on those locomotives.)<br />
I was soon called around for other little jobs: Grinding away painted &#8220;X&#8221;s that would make the boiler inspector wonder what was going on, scrubbing away rust at a new weld for the whistle assembly (and painting it), helping Larry and Mitch sort out what the heck they did wrong with a set of pipes and brackets, and all the while learning a little bit more about how it all works together.<br />
Maintaining a steam locomotive requires a lot of problem solving. It&#8217;s the ultimate in 3D puzzles &#8212; it only goes together one way, and if you&#8217;ve got it wrong, you have to figure out why on your own &#8212; the manuals no longer exist for these machines. This is how Mitch, Larry, and I ended up spending most of an hour trying to figure out where a set of lines were supposed to run. The logic was easy enough, but there was always something critical we were missing. Ultimately, Larry figured out that we&#8217;d mounted the pipes on the wrong site of the bracket. Thirty minutes later, the pipes were connecting properly once again.<br />
Harry arrived an hour or so after we started working. It was an honour to meet him at last. Although in excellent shape, Harry must be well into his 70s. This was a man who knew the 6060. The others often commented that their wives called the 6060 the &#8220;Iron Mistress&#8221;, with all the time she demanded. It was clear that Harry was quite willing to let the time be taken.<br />
As the afternoon wore on, I found myself almost every where on the locomotive, pulling this, hauling that, pushing something I didn&#8217;t know I was supposed to push, lifting insanely heavy dome lids, and running errands into the shed. But by far the weirdest experience was when Harry asked me to give him a hand with the firebox.<br />
There are two essential parts to a steam locomotive: The firebox and the boiler. Like its name suggests, the firebox is where the fire exists. In steam locomotives of this size, it&#8217;s big enough for several people &#8212; certainly large enough for the two of us.<br />
Donning a painter&#8217;s suit, we climbed inside the 6060&#8217;s firebox, Harry leading the way to show me how it&#8217;s done. I&#8217;m pretty much certain I wouldn&#8217;t do very well on a submarine. Although I was only in the firebox for about 10-15 minutes, it was enough to give me the creeps. Still, it was fascinating. I could see where the oil sprayed into the brick-lined pit (it used to be coal, before the 6060 was switched over to fuel oil), the blower grate at the bottom for air, and the huge superheater pipes that led out to the stack.<br />
Harry was inspecting the inside so he&#8217;d know what to say when the inspector arrived the following day. It&#8217;s not easy running a steam locomotive, and you really need to know what you&#8217;re doing. Luckily, Harry does.<br />
This mostly concluded the work day. While Larry and I were to head off for home. Harry, Mitch, and Al would return to Stettler to their motel room. It was another long, hard day to come. I only wished I could stay to help. But I had to return from the past and prepare again for the present. My real life called.<br />
But the dream is far from over. Engineers like Harry are a dying breed. New blood is needed to keep these machines running. People need to show others how we grew as a country &#8212; on highways made of steel. That is why I&#8217;ll be back again, to help work on the 6060, to bring her back to life and do what she does best &#8212; run full steam ahead.<br />
So why am I doing all this? Well, if you&#8217;ve read enough of my journals, you probably already know. The future is nothing without the past as its foundation. Or, as Harry likes to say: &#8220;We serve the future by preserving the past.&#8221;<br />
With luck, and a little bit of effort, the Spirit of Alberta will live forever.<br />

		<p>Everyone needs a break from time to time, and Critical Mass was more than willing to give us a little time to breathe. So in addition to the statutory holiday on Monday, they decided to give us Friday off as well.<br />
So of course, I had to come into work.<br />
This is the joy of having a large client, to whom I&#8217;m currently tied, and I sit in a position of far too much responsibility to shirk. End result, I was here at 8:00am, when visions of sugarplums were still dancing in others heads.<br />
Luckily for me, that only lasted half of the day &#8212; I was out of here by about 1:30. That left the rest of my day to wander around, see what was up &#8230; and catch a matinee. I haven&#8217;t been to a matinee since I got my job &#8212; one of the many things I miss about working at Radical. But hey, getting the things you can&#8217;t normally have makes them all the better.<br />
Following my matinee, I wandered around Chinook Centre for a while, doing a little bit of window shopping, buying some magazines, and generally wasting time. I wanted to see the 8:15pm showing of AI, which the Famous Players had showing on their IMAX screen. Go big, or go home, I say.<br />
As the time neared to the show, I checked my cell phone, only to discover that I had a voice mail message &#8212; Stuart and Therese, who had suggested catching dinner and a movie. Thinking it would be neat if they could make it down to Chinook in time, I called to see where they were.<br />
Pulling into Chinook&#8217;s parking lot. [Insert &#8220;Twilight Zone&#8221; theme here.]<br />
Weird things happen right out of the blue.<br />
Saturday, I slept in. I really needed to sleep in. The week can be quite draining, especially if you&#8217;re under the gun. The question was: What to do with the day? There were many things we could do, but with part of the day already gone, going too far out of the city wasn&#8217;t really an option. There was, however, Bragg Creek.<br />
Bragg Creek is an itty-bitty little hamlet (it&#8217;s not even a village) about 30 minutes west of Calgary. You can miss it, quite easily &#8212; although there is a sign for it on the highway (darned if I know why). It takes less than 30 seconds to pass by the &#8220;downtown&#8221; core, a group of buildings mostly there to attract tourists, though why tourists go to Bragg Creek is a bit of a mystery &#8230; those buildings are pretty much all that&#8217;s there.<br />
Chris, Tamara (one of our co-workers), and I braved the trip to spend an hour and a half wandering in and out of the stores. Admittedly, the shops there are (kinda) unique, and do have some things that are appealing. To someone, anyway. The cowboy shop was amusing to say the least, especially when the family of Japanese tourists came whipping in. There&#8217;s something about hearing a Japanese family squabble interspersed with the country and western playing over the store&#8217;s sound system.<br />
The candy store was probably being run by the guy who founded Bragg Creek. He manned the ice cream side of the store, while others (his grandson, perhaps) ran the candy side. We were finding candy that none of us had seen since we were kids &#8230; stuff that had been *made* when we were kids, for all we knew. I settled on peanut brittle and Oreo cookie fudge. Although the brittle&#8217;s gone, I&#8217;m a little apprehensive to try the fudge&#8230;<br />
Chris offered to buy us an ice cream. It&#8217;s amazing how fast you can feel like a kid just by having someone buy you an ice cream. It always reminds me of the times when my father suddenly got into an ice cream mood, announced we were going out, and would take the family down to the Baskin &amp; Robbins just west of the harbour. We&#8217;d get our favourite flavours, and whip down to the piers on the lake to eat and watch the boats come in and out.<br />
Simple pleasures are by far the best.<br />
Departing Bragg Creek, we headed southeast, a direction Tamara said would ultimately take us back into the city, via a slightly longer, but much more scenic route. When we found ourselves at the junction, we could either go east to Calgary, or west to the Elbow Falls.<br />
Detours are a simple pleasure.<br />
The Elbow Falls are nothing overly spectacular, especially if you&#8217;ve ever seen Niagara Falls or something that falls a few hundred metres. This drops about ten metres in total, and the water volume isn&#8217;t really all that impressive. But the scenery in which it lies is certainly worth the diversion. It was for the wedding party having video and the pictures snapped overlooking the falls.<br />
The Elbow River supplies 1/3 of Alberta&#8217;s population with water (Calgary&#8217;s Glenmore Reservoir dams up the river as it enters the city), so it&#8217;s an important river to us. In many ways, probably more important than the Bow River, which although larger, supplies no water. The really interesting thing is that (keeping the size of the population using the water) the Elbow River watershed occupies only 0.2% of Alberta&#8217;s landmass, and is barely twice the size of Calgary itself.<br />
The trip back to Calgary took us through the rolling hills and plains that make up our part of Alberta. It&#8217;s really nice to see something other than asphalt and concrete. But before long the ever-expanding city broke the horizon and we found ourselves nestled back in civilization.<br />
We stopped at Smuggler&#8217;s Inn for dinner. This is one of those quasi-landmark restaurants that most towns and cities have managed to dispose of. It&#8217;s &#8230; uh &#8230; well &#8230; the decor is &#8230; odd. No, &#8220;odd&#8221; isn&#8217;t the word. It&#8217;s sort of like a kick-back to the joys of (bad) 70s styling, only much darker. 13 Coins in Seattle was not quite this cheesy. But at least the food at Smuggler&#8217;s Inn was better. (In retrospect, I can think of several places I would have preferred to go&#8230;)<br />
Conversation was &#8230; interesting. It mostly revolved around Chris and I defending ourselves from Tamara. She&#8217;s got a quick wit and sometimes a vicious sense of humour, but is always willing to take a fun poke when it&#8217;s well-delivered. By the time we left, Chris and I had been classified as &#8220;undateable&#8221; and &#8220;not dating material&#8221;, at least by/with Tamara.<br />
Now I know how Pintos felt when they got rear-ended.<br />
I dropped Chris and Tamara off at Chinook so they could see the 8:15 showing of AI. I would have liked to have stayed &#8230; but there was nothing playing at the right time. So I went home.<br />
To watch a movie.<br />
I picked Chris, Tamara, and Tamara&#8217;s friend Jensenne (who met Chris and Tamara at the theatre) and we all went downtown. Although originally under the guise of going home (Tamara seems to have this odd habit of going to bed early), we ended up at the Ship and Anchor, one of the less interesting (and nice) bars in town.<br />
The next morning, I rose a little earlier than the previous day. It was Canada Day, and we were going to Banff. Or at least we were going to Banff, until Chris said he was going to stick around for the skate and punk show in Calgary. Yes, there was a punk and skate show here in Calgary. A big one. Quite good too, so I understand, and Chris has been to a few in Toronto.<br />
(Take that all you people who think Calgary is nothing but cowboys! That doesn&#8217;t start until this Friday&#8230; [shudder])<br />
Therese, Stuart, and I were going to make the most of it &#8212; by going to Banff! (Bamf!), Canada&#8217;s first national park. Leaving my &#8220;movil de la muerte&#8221; at their apartment, we headed off in their Jetta for the sort-of-great outdoors. (Hey, we were going to Banff (Bamf) &#8212; it&#8217;s not exactly the middle of Algonquin Park.)<br />
One of the many great things about Canada Day (aside from being Canadian, that is) &#8212; it&#8217;s free to go into the National Parks! That also meant, however, that there would likely be a &#8220;few&#8221; people there ahead of us. Still, we got a spot in the free lot, and proceeded to experience Canada Day in Banff (Bamf).<br />
Our first order of business was dim sum. We were going to go to the Silver Dragon, sister restaurant to the Silver Dragon in Calgary. However, much to our extreme dismay, they didn&#8217;t serve dim sum. In fact, the place was nearly empty. Disappointment reigned for a short while.<br />
Unabashed by the general lack of tasty bite-sized Chinese food, we set out to experience the day, and walked our way to the Banff Springs Hotel. We found our way to the Terrace, where we partook of a very tasty lunch. It was food we would need for the activity of the afternoon: Climbing Sulphur Mountain.<br />
Sulphur Mountain overlooks Banff (Bamf), and is the source of the hot springs that made Banff (Bamf) famous (and indeed, made Banff (Bamf) itself). We had to hike up trails between the hotel and the upper hot springs, where the trail up Sulphur mountain began. Although only 1.7kms, it was still a steep hike. It wasn&#8217;t easy for Therese, either &#8212; her shoes had inadvertently been forgotten in the car. (A constant source of conversation during our hike.)<br />
Arriving at the foot of the main path, we looked wantonly at the gondola, which would whisk us to the top in about eight minutes. The path we were about to start was about two hours. But nothing was every accomplished by taking the easy route. So with overshirt and bottle of water in hand (and a backpack on Stuart&#8217;s back), the three of us (along with a number of other brave/insane souls) started up the mountain.<br />
From the foot of the trail, it&#8217;s a 698 metre vertical, 5 km climb. Few parts of it are even remotely flat (when they came, it was a point for cheering), the majority of it is steep. But the hike is certainly worth the effort &#8212; the views from the side are amazing. One day, I will go back with a camera and make a proper record of what you can see.<br />
We had to stop a few times, more frequently as we got closer to the top (I convinced myself it was a lack of oxygen, rather than my poorly-maintained body crying out in agony). But 1 hour and 50 minutes later (beating the average by 10 minutes) we arrived at the observation deck. We made an immediate run for the snack bar, where we purchased litre bottles of Powerade to ward of the killer thirst we&#8217;d developed.<br />
But the climb wasn&#8217;t entirely done. We continued along the top of the mountain, finally arriving at Sanson&#8217;s Peak, the top of the Sulphur Mountain. Needless to say, we were quite happy that the rest of the trip was all downhill from there&#8230;<br />
We took the gondola back (after waiting in line nearly 45 minutes), and then walked the road all the way back downtown, arriving there around 6:15 in the evening. We were exhausted. Our legs were screaming at us, our feet throbbed (Therese&#8217;s little toes had blisters from her sandals), and we were dying for something to help us relax. So we found a patio, ordered some beer, and kicked back.<br />
Not quite simple, perhaps, but nevertheless rewarding.<br />
The drive home was a little quieter than the drive out. We were wiped. We were tired. (I was wired on sugar, but that only kept me awake.) But it was a good tired, one we could feel good about.<br />
I woke a little earlier the next day &#8230; but that&#8217;s a story for another entry&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I need a weekend from my weekend.<br />
Every so often, I get involved with a very busy Saturday and Sunday. Not necessarily physically demanding, but no less a drain on one&#8217;s energy level. I&#8217;m fortunate in that I don&#8217;t get caught in those every weekend &#8212; if I felt like I do now every Monday, I&#8217;d start falling sleep on my keyboard.<br />
Saturday was Janine and Dory&#8217;s wedding. Remember that stag I went to a couple of weeks ago? (See [[Stag Party in Innisfail, Strippers in Red Deer]].) Well, this was the wedding that it was leading up to. Chris and I were each other&#8217;s guest. We&#8217;d been slid in towards the end of invitations &#8212; we were more &#8220;fringe&#8221; than most &#8212; assumedly after a few were unable to attend. It was a large wedding.<br />
Although the wedding wasn&#8217;t until 1pm, I was up at 8:30 to get myself ready. I cut my hair (it was looking a little scraggly), showered, shaved, and made a quick run to the Safeway for a card for the present, and bow. We watched a little TV to relax a bit, and then got dressed. It was time for me to try on my new suit.<br />
Yes, I bought a new suit. (For those of you who might not know me as well, this is a big thing for me. Suits and I have had a long-standing animosity for each other.) I finally decided that I was going to get something newer than the pants and jacket that I&#8217;ve been wearing for the better part of 10 years. No, I don&#8217;t regularly wear suits. Don&#8217;t much like &#8217;em, really. Well, actually, I don&#8217;t much like the suits I used to wear. Not really comfortable. This was a chance for me to get a good suit&#8230; a really good suit. In fact, I&#8217;ve been saving up for one for a while.<br />
This started at the beginning of the month. While out for a walk one fine Saturday, I found myself in Grafton &amp; Co., a menswear store in Calgary&#8217;s Eaton Centre. While perusing the store, one of the clerks, Jeff, came up and asked me what I was looking for. I described the situation, and he promptly disappeared, returning a few moments later with some suits. His skill for sizing a customer without a tape measure was amazing &#8212; he was right almost every time (he only missed my neck size by an inch).<br />
It was an all-new outfit. New jacket, new shirt (French-cut cuffs, which means I also had new cuff links), new tie (as much as I loathe and despite ties), new slacks, new belt, and new shoes. I was amazed when I had first tried it on in the store about how good it felt. My previous suits had always been uncomfortable. Even spending the whole day wearing it wasn&#8217;t uncomfortable. As much as I hate to say it, I could get used to something like that&#8230;<br />
Anyway, we made the 1.5 hour trip to Innisfail at a relatively snappy pace up Highway 2. Although I thought we had left at an appropriate time, we were running a little late to get there. As it stands we arrived at just the right time to meet up with Stuart and Geoff (Geoff Ho, one of Therese and Janine&#8217;s classmates, who&#8217;s been on an internship in Minneapolis) to take our seats in the church. While Stuart sat a bit more forward in the church, Chris, Geoff, and I sat towards the back.<br />
The Innisfail United Church is perhaps the smallest church I&#8217;ve been in. Mind you, Innisfail is a small town with five churches, so it&#8217;s probably not that big an issue. Still, the church was 2/3 full of guests. Guests were dressed in varying attire, from formal (which was basically the wedding party), to dressy (which category Chris and I fell into, along with many others), to trendy (which meant that while you had a cool suit, you weren&#8217;t wearing a tie), and all the way down to jeans and a t-shirt.<br />
We were in farm country, after all.<br />
When Dory finally emerged through a door near the altar with the minister, he was deliriously nervous. Almost as soon as he was in place, the music changed, and Therese emerged from the back. (Therese was the Maid of Honour.) He was wearing a rather stunning purple dress, accented with an antique rhinestone necklace she&#8217;d bought a few weeks earlier. A moment later, and Janine came through the door. Her dress was exceptional, rare for wedding dresses, I find, complete with a short train.<br />
The minister led a simple ceremony, following what I assume to be normal United service. (I don&#8217;t know, this was my first United wedding.) It was also my first time at a church with a female minister. The United Church of Canada ordains women now, and it seems that even in some of the more &#8220;redneck&#8221; and &#8220;backwater&#8221; areas of Alberta (those were words I heard used in the same sentence as &#8220;Innisfail&#8221;), female ministers are not shunned.<br />
After the 30-odd minute ceremony, we all filed outside to see Janine and Dory off. They really weren&#8217;t going anywhere in particular &#8212; mostly just for the pictures, at which point they&#8217;d return for the reception that evening. The highlight of their departure was the mode of transportation, specifically their limousine. Now, this wasn&#8217;t any ordinary limo. This was a stretch pickup truck.<br />
No, I&#8217;m not kidding.<br />
This limo can easily hold about 12 people in serious comfort. It still has the truck bed in the rear, and it even has bull horns mounted to the hood. For a rancher, it&#8217;s gotta be the coolest thing to drive away in. Janine and Dory had basically done it as a joke &#8212; it was a total fluke it was even available at the time &#8212; but were loving every second of it. The owner/driver looked the part too, striking a passing resemblance to actor Sam Elliot, though without the Texas drawl.<br />
Left to our own devices, the rest of us tried to figure out what to do next. Though still fringe, Chris and I were &#8220;invited&#8221; (it was more of a general call than a specific invitation) to join the Psychology students (and guests) at the Red Deer Lodge for an afternoon of food, pool, and drinking. We had four and a half hours to kill. It seemed like a good idea, certainly better than spending four and a half hours in Innisfail.<br />
Red Deer is a little nicer in the daytime (looks a little seedy at night). The Red Deer Lodge isn&#8217;t as bad as it sounds, either. It&#8217;s actually a little more upscale than your average Holiday Inn. But the pool hall (attached to the rear of the hotel) wasn&#8217;t open, much to our dismay. We instead went to Reflections, their &#8220;Executive Club&#8221;, inside. At least we were dressed the part.<br />
Four hours later, we were in the Receiving Line, greeting Janine and Dory&#8217;s family. The reception was at the Innisfail Legion hall. Although mostly a utilitarian building, it was amazing what a few lights and simple decorations could do to make it look very nice. After a little while, it was easy to forget where you were. Dinner was reasonably simple: Steak and potatoes. Pretty much what you&#8217;d expect for a cattle rancher&#8217;s wedding. (But it was a far cry from the proposed &#8220;Meat Salad&#8221; Simon had drooled over during our stay at the Red Deer Lodge.)<br />
The cattle jokes ran most of the night, mostly from Janine and Dory&#8217;s so-called family and friends, who took extreme pleasure in telling some very embarrassing (albeit funny) stories. I was sorry to say I had nothing to say &#8230; well, nothing except for one story about Dory&#8217;s truck, but I wasn&#8217;t keen on telling it because I couldn&#8217;t remember some of the specifics.<br />
Soon it was time for the first dance, to Elvis&#8217; &#8220;(I Can&#8217;t Help) Falling In Love With You&#8221;. A very good choice, in my humble opinion. The songs then slowly progressed from the traditional to the modern, including the dreaded &#8220;Macarena&#8221; (which Chris actually danced to &#8230; something to which I have to give a huge amount of credit, I&#8217;m not even sure I&#8217;d do that under threat of death). The &#8220;Chicken Dance&#8221;, fortunately, did not rear its ugly head.<br />
I, regrettably, had to make Chris leave just after midnight. The joys of my life often boil down to scheduling things, and in trying to make as many people happy as possible, had scheduled a river rafting trip for the following day. (Originally it had been tentatively scheduled for the day of the wedding, until I realized that I&#8217;d made a boo-boo.)<br />
My alarm went off at 7:30. Five hours of sleep just wasn&#8217;t enough. Nearly 12 hours of socializing, though not physically exhausting, still takes quite a wallop on your energy level. (I can only imaging how Janine and Dory must&#8217;ve felt the following day.) Still, being the ringleader for the day&#8217;s events meant I had to get on the ball very quickly.<br />
Unfortunately, it meant I forgot a towel and a change of clothes, as I was in too much of a rush to get out the door.<br />
Picking up Aysim and Jordon along the way, we pulled into Critical Mass&#8217; parking lot at 8:30, a few minutes later than I would have liked. But we were still waiting for others, so it wasn&#8217;t too bad. Cory, Angie, Mike, and Colin were already there. Carl was running late, and Shawn would be picked up along the way. Clay was nowhere in sight, and I was beginning to worry about all of us showing up on time.<br />
It was time for another trip down the Kicking Horse river (see [[A Whitewater Rafting Adventure on the Kicking Horse River]]). Fifty-one weeks ago, myself and five others braved the cold, churning waters to experience the thrill of ice-cold rapids. Two of us experienced it the hard way, by being thrown into the river (Sean catching the worst of it). So of course, we had to go again. (Although Sean is no longer with Critical Mass, he organized his own trip, which went the day before.)<br />
Cory, Angie, and Carl took off almost as soon as Carl had arrived. We waited around until Clay arrived (about 10 minutes later), at which time Colin, Mike, Jordon, and I left. Clay and Aysim still had to pick up Clay&#8217;s friend, but would meet us at Kootenay River Runners.<br />
All of us were off like a shot. We didn&#8217;t clear Calgary city limits until 9:00, so once again I played that dangerous game of chicken with the police and their radar guns. It never fails &#8212; you plan everything so that you don&#8217;t have to rush, and you always end up exceeding the speed limit by almost 50%. With luck, none of the flying meter maids were out &#8212; the last thing I need to is to get a ticket for the speeds we were hauling through the mountains.<br />
The drive out wasn&#8217;t too bad &#8212; unlike last year, it wasn&#8217;t raining. However, it was a quiet ride as my passengers all fell asleep. Next time, someone else can drive and *I&#8217;ll* sleep the whole way there.<br />
Cory had beat us by about 15 minutes. Clay was about that behind us, as were two more cars of Critical Mass people. They had come out the day before and camped (or taken a hotel room) for the night. There were 17 of us in total (others were Karen, Mark, and two of their friends, and Jaymie and her boyfriend Beau), and all raring to wet.<br />
Well, okay, maybe not all. Only three of us had gone rafting before (Cory, Jordon, and myself, and it had been a decade since Jordon last went), so the majority of us were newbies. Most were excited, Shawn a little much so, but no-one was ready to run screaming.<br />
Yet.<br />
After a small lunch, we got the equipment speech. Basically covers the basics of what we would wear. Not much had changed since the year before, only that we now had gloves and neoprene &#8220;socks&#8221; to help keep our feet warm. (They worked, too &#8212; my feet were much warmer this year.) We collected our gear, changed, and huddled down to the river for Orientation Part II. This is the safety speech, and the one that was beginning to freak Angie out a little. As the safety speech often includes worst-case scenarios, the uninitiated can get a little spooked.<br />
The river didn&#8217;t look too much different, though the water level was a little lower this year. (The temperature had been a bit colder in recent days, and the water hadn&#8217;t flowed as freely as a result.) Our guide, Mike, told us that the more impressive parts of the run, namely an 18-foot tall standing wave known as &#8220;Tablesaw&#8221;) wouldn&#8217;t be out, as the water level was too low. However, he said he&#8217;d still make it worth our while.<br />
Mike: &#8220;Okay, how do you want this? Easy, or [expletive deleted] hardcode?&#8221;<br />
Us: (Shouting loudly) &#8220;[EXPLETIVE DELETED] HARDCORE!&#8221;<br />
That pretty much set the tone for our trip. (That, and Mike (the guide) telling a lot of really bad jokes.) Poor Angie must&#8217;ve been terrified out of her mind after all our yelling and screaming. Something to do with testosterone, I guess. Either way, she would periodically emit a sound not unlike &#8220;What am I doing here?&#8221; as we continued down the &#8220;easy&#8221; part of the river. But it wasn&#8217;t long before the choppiness began to appear, and we started getting a little wet. After our first plunge through a Class 2 rapid, I could hear Angie saying: &#8220;That wasn&#8217;t so bad!&#8221;<br />
Soon we were going right through the middle of the hard stuff. Mike (our guide) was doing an excellent job of steering us right into the nasty stuff. Big water, large drops, holes behind rocks, and all of it as fast as we could paddle. Most of the other boats thought we were insane. (Aside from the fact that we were.) Most described us as &#8220;loud&#8221;.<br />
About halfway down, we reached the infamous &#8220;Portage&#8221;, a kilometre or so stretch of Class 3 and 4 rapids. This is usually the home of Tablesaw (when the water level is high), and the permanent home of Shotgun, the rapid that had wiped out our boat last year, dumping Sean and I in the drink. Angie, though a little nervous, wasn&#8217;t trying to get out of the boat. She wasn&#8217;t nearly as frightened as when we started.<br />
Soon, the boats had pulled out, and all six rafts took Portage head-on, with us going full tilt. Although I saw more of Portage this year than last (I was sitting one person back, so I could actually see this time), it was still a blur. Our guide handled it much better than the one we had the year before, quite often calling out &#8220;hang on&#8221; and &#8220;get down&#8221; as we piled right into (and over) rapids and rocks. When we finally hit Shotgun, we were running on pure adrenaline. Our war whoop echoed through the Kicking Horse valley.<br />
Shawn was nearly bursting through his skin, as was Carl. (Carl, up until that point, was the most laid back person I&#8217;ve ever met. Once caught up in the whole experience, he gave Shawn a run for his money as the loudest.) Angie now bore a devilish grin. She liked it. Too much. Mike (not the guide) and Colin were both pumped. Mike (the guide) was loving each second. We weren&#8217;t your &#8220;average&#8221; rafters &#8212; we wanted it hard, which meant he could do the kinds of things he would normally do only for himself&#8230;<br />
Like get caught in a hole. This is when the river has go around a large rock. It creates a region of low pressure, which draws in things, like our raft. It sounds dangerous, but it&#8217;s not. All it does is swamp the boat a bit, but as it&#8217;s self-draining anyway, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. We swamped the boat five or six times, each time paddling madly to get as close to the rock so we could flood the boat.<br />
Yeah, we were insane.<br />
About an hour later, we exited the last of the rapids for the upper portion of the river. This was when Mike (our guide) offered us a dip in the river, if we wanted. He didn&#8217;t even get a chance to finish the sentence before we&#8217;d all bailed into the river. At first, it wasn&#8217;t too bad. The face was a bit chilly, but all in all, I didn&#8217;t HOLY CRAP THIS WATER IS FREEZING GET ME THE HECK OUTTA HERE!!!<br />
I lunged for the perimeter line to start hauling myself back in. Shawn, who had hit the water only seconds before me, was now struggling to get back, realizing himself that the water was rather cold. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard to haul yourself into one of these rafts &#8212; they sit high, and the now water-logged wetsuits and pullovers make you a little heavier than you might be without them. This is when I started to get a little worried.<br />
Because the boat was empty.<br />
Apparently, we&#8217;d all bailed into the river. I immediately began to wonder if we&#8217;d have to stay like this right until the end, which although not far away, felt like eternity in that water. But then I saw Mike (the guide) reach over, grab my life jacket, and haul me in. It took me a moment to get back up, but then I reached down and grabbed Carl, and hauled him in. I landed in the bottom of the raft, Carl on top of me. Then Mike (the guide) ceremoniously dumped Shawn on top of us. Then Cory and Colin came flying in, all of us a tangle of bodies.<br />
We tried to convince the staff to let us do the Lower Kicking Horse that afternoon. Unfortunately, they didn&#8217;t have enough room on the bus to let us go, as much as we wanted to. We&#8217;ll just have to wait until next time for that, I guess.<br />
We peeled off our second skins back at the Whitewater Ranch, and changed into dry clothes. Bidding our guides farewell, we broke a few more speed limits getting to St. James&#8217; Gate, a pub in Banff. It was time for the post-rafting beer and grub. We were all famished. It was obvious then that this was something we&#8217;d certainly do again. I just have to figure out when&#8217;s a good time to go, find all the people, and make sure we do the Upper and Lower portions. We&#8217;re not doing it halfway again&#8230;<br />
But I&#8217;m not driving.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Although it&#8217;s been a very long time since I was a scout, I still try to do good deeds. Last night, nine dedicated CMassers did a good deed.<br />
Owing to employee pressure, Critical Mass started doing charity work some months ago. So far, it&#8217;s entailed a head-shaving fundraiser, an auction, and a couple of food drives (I think &#8212; some of the beginning of this year is a bit blurry). We&#8217;re getting into Habitat for Humanity, though we haven&#8217;t done anything with it yet.<br />
One thing we have done a few times, and this is a regular activity for us, is to make dinner one night at month at the Mustard Seed Street Ministry kitchen, for Calgary&#8217;s financially inhibited. We donate the majority of the food for that meal, and the labour to create it. Last night was my first crack at the kitchen.<br />
We headed over at 4:00 to the &#8220;Seed&#8221; (as it&#8217;s referred to by its staff) to start preparation. We had to chop and cook everything we had with us. Mercy, the Bistro manager and our head chef, headed over early to get started. Within a few minutes of arriving, we were mercilessly chopping celery, broccoli, bok choy (I was &#8220;Bok Choy Boy&#8221;), onions (luckily, they had a machine which did most of the work, but we had to peel and quarter them first), and carrots (I was on peeling detail).<br />
Early into the cutting process, I started to notice a strong stinging sensation in my right hand. I noticed, much to my chagrin, that the knife I was using was literally scraping skin off my forefinger. Most knives are thin metal plates with either plastic or wood wrapped around (or tacked to the side of) the handle. This knife had a serious user interface problem &#8212; the wood was too short, and left an 1/8 inch strip jutting out the top. Although not as sharp as the blade (which was pretty darn sharp, let me tell you), it was enough to peel off some skin. I donned a surgical glove for the remainder of the evening.<br />
Part way through the chopping, I was asked to help out with another task. While four of us cut veggies, three others were chopping fruit. We were making fruit salad for dessert. A lot of fruit salad. About 50 pounds of it, as near as I can tell. It had to be mixed in a very large pot, and I somehow landed the task of stirring the mass of fruit.<br />
With my arm.<br />
I was up to my elbow in melon and strawberries. It was a peculiar sensation, to say the least. It would have probably been a lot more pleasant if the fruit were warmer, but it was still chilled from refrigeration. My fingers were numb after a few minutes. That said, it felt like I was doing a remake of the kitchen scene from &#8220;9 1/2 Weeks&#8221;.<br />
We were making a stupidly large amount of food. The Seed is well-equipped for such a meal, though, complete with a huge array of pots of varying sizes (ranging from gigantic to titanic), scoops that can take about over a litre of contents at once, massive ovens that cooked eight huge pans of rice, an immense grill we used for stir frying the veggies, and a &#8230; uh &#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what to call it &#8230; a square caldron we used for cooking the sweet and sour chicken.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t have a complete recipe, here&#8217;s the one we used to make the sweet and sour chicken:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>80 lb</td>
<td>Cubed, cooked meat (chicken)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15 lb</td>
<td>Onions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>15</td>
<td>Garlic cloves, crushed</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4&#215;100 oz</td>
<td>Pineapple</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 L</td>
<td>Soy sauce</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Brown sugar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 cups</td>
<td>Vinegar</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20 L</td>
<td>Water</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>It all fit into that one cauldron.<br />
Add to that 50 lbs of fruit salad, three very large pots (each about 50 lbs) of vegetables, and at least 40 lbs of rice &#8230; that&#8217;s a lot of food. Aside from the vegetables, it was mostly cooked by 6:30, at which time the staff (including volunteers and ourselves) got to eat. Despite the mass quantities of food, it was still quite tasty. And the rice turned out much better than I thought was possible in an oven (better than any rice I&#8217;ve ever made).<br />
Then the rush started. Heather, Steve, Bill, Therese, and Eryn took the frontline for serving, Carla helped dispense coffee and tea, Mercy cooked the vegetables, and Jen and I did the grunt labour of keeping the serving trays full and the vegetables flowing to the grill to be cooked.<br />
The four and a half hours disappeared, and soon it was 8:30, which is when the kitchen closes. There wasn&#8217;t much left &#8212; a little for lunch, but that was about it. At that point, we were free to leave. All we had to do was cut, cook, and serve. Other staff were responsible for cleaning up after our mess. (And we made a pretty decent one, although it was hard to tell by the end &#8212; the Seed staff are very quick at cleaning up.)<br />
As we began to shut up the kitchen, signifying the end of dinner, one of the Seed&#8217;s patrons stuck his head in through one of the serving windows, to say thanks for dinner. He said something like this:<br />
&#8220;Y&#8217;know the movie &#8216;Angels in the Outfield&#8217;? Well, we got Angels in the kitchen!&#8221;<br />
We had served about 500 people, although we have yet to receive an exact number. We were feeling really good about ourselves. Until we went outside, that is.<br />
There were about a hundred people who hadn&#8217;t been able to get in. A hundred people who wouldn&#8217;t get dinner. It was sobering to realize that for all those you do help, there are always more in need. It just emphasized that what we are doing is in no way trivial.<br />
It&#8217;s also in no way easy. I was sore. I was physically exhausted. And my feet were ready to declare themselves a separate and distinct society from the rest of my body. But it was very rewarding. I opted to skip a movie last night, and instead curled up in a chair at home to rest.<br />
I will help at the Seed again, that much is for certain. Just not until my feet stop pounding.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Note to self: Never let anyone hold a stag party for me.<br />
Stuart, Chris, and I were invited to a stag party for our friend Dory. (Dory is Janine&#8217;s fiancée; Janine is one of Therese&#8217;s best friends.) Chris opted out, as he had a tight deadline to contend with. (In retrospect, I wish I could have said the same thing.)<br />
The party was in Innisfail, an itty-bitty community just south of Red Deer. It&#8217;s not noted for much, except maybe a John Deere dealership. Following some rather precise directions, we soon found ourselves at Hugh&#8217;s, whom I assume to be Dory&#8217;s best man.<br />
At first, Stuart and I were out of place. We&#8217;re city folk. Everyone else &#8230; wasn&#8217;t. They were either ranchers or farmers. Stuart at least had the upper hand &#8212; he knew something about seed protectants (owing to his tenure with agricultural advertising at his company). By comparison, I knew that cows go &#8220;moo&#8221;.<br />
Luckily, we weren&#8217;t the only city folk for long, as Dave and Wayne soon showed up. It gave us some conversation outside of poisoning groundhogs. (And no, I&#8217;m not kidding.) We were fed hamburgers and potato salad, both of which were outstanding. Had Stuart and I not eaten before departing Calgary, we probably would have ate more.<br />
The evening was &#8230; well &#8230; I&#8217;ve been to more interesting stags. All one of them. Yep, this is only my second stag. (Most my friends who have been married had the smarts to either not hold a stag, or at least the sense not to invite me.) My first (and only other) stag was for my friend Jason when I still lived in Toronto. It pretty much involved an hour of laser tag, and about $40 of video games at Sega City. Frankly, that&#8217;s my idea of fun.<br />
But I certainly wasn&#8217;t about to complain. This was Dory&#8217;s night, not mine. Besides, I met a few people I hadn&#8217;t before. So all in all, it wasn&#8217;t such a bad night.<br />
At least until talk of &#8220;peelers&#8221; (strippers) became more serious. I kept hoping this wasn&#8217;t one of those things that would evolve into reality. There are things I want to do in life. Visiting a strip club isn&#8217;t one of them. (It&#8217;s in my &#8220;no desire to&#8221; list, actually.) Around 11pm, one of the guests finally got the gumption, grabbed Dory, declared we were all going to &#8220;The Park&#8221;, and headed towards the trucks.<br />
I personally do not see the fascination with strip clubs. I don&#8217;t find them even remotely interesting &#8230; more revolting, repulsive, and degrading than anything else. It&#8217;s one of those last few vestiges of patriarchal society that were supposed to have been washed away with the Suffrage Movement. Instead, they hold a certainly appeal with (most) men. (Chris would later state that even if he had come, he wouldn&#8217;t have gone into the club. Frankly, I don&#8217;t blame him.)<br />
Stuart and I tentatively discussed joining the rest, both of us testing each other to see if we wanted to go. (We hadn&#8217;t discussed this ahead of time.) Neither of us seemed all that interested. The plan was to drive to the highway, and quietly disappear. However, we didn&#8217;t even make it to the car before someone shouted: &#8220;Hey! You got room in your car?&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s kinda hard to hide an empty back seat.<br />
We found ourselves driving two of Dory&#8217;s friends into downtown Red Deer. Although I cannot remember their names, they reminded me of high school jocks (there&#8217;s something about naked women that seems to turn men into adolescents &#8230; most men, anyway). Both knew where The Park was. Somehow, that didn&#8217;t surprise me. Stuart and I agreed to make an appearance, and then duck out. Which was good, &#8216;cuz even from the outside, this place didn&#8217;t look all that great. I shuddered at the thought of what lay beyond the door.<br />
We were told that once upon a time, The Park was actually a &#8220;nice&#8221; place. That was hard to believe by looking around. It looked like someone had set off a bad 70s linoleum bomb. Other horrors of the attack included tacky lights, bad music, really bad furniture, and staff and patrons that were &#8230; frightening. As one of my co-workers so eloquently put it, it was a place so seedy, you needed a tetanus shot. The only thing missing was the biker gang&#8230;<br />
&#8230;who showed up later.<br />
We caught the tail end of an act that had a few of us wanting to run screaming. However, we were obligated to at least wish Dory well before leaving. We stuck around just long enough for me to have something to drink (in the drive from Hugh&#8217;s I had become enormously thirsty) and Stuart to play a very quick game of foosball. But it was just long enough for trouble to start. The rest of the group was looking to get Dory into the &#8220;traditional&#8221; embarrassing situation.<br />
This is usually done in two stages: 1) Get the person extremely drunk (this has two advantages: less resistance, and the unlucky victim can claim plausible denial in the event they get in trouble with their significant other), and 2) Put them where they wouldn&#8217;t normally be caught dead. In Dory&#8217;s case, it was six shots of something nasty (never did find out what), and tipping the manager to get Dory on stage. (He was taped to the chair so he couldn&#8217;t move. I&#8217;m not sure of this was so he couldn&#8217;t touch the dancer &#8212; Quebec has that rule &#8212; or just so he couldn&#8217;t run away.)<br />
We stuck around to watch poor Dory be subjected to something just shy of pure evil (aren&#8217;t we such good friends?). At first, we assumed that Dory was looking away due to discomfort (for the record, there was no nudity while Dory was on stage). But after a couple minutes, a few of us began to suspect that he wasn&#8217;t uncomfortable &#8212; he was rapidly heading towards unconsciousness. Part way through the second song, to the apparent dismay of the dancer, Dory passed out.<br />
It was simultaneously the funniest and saddest thing I think I&#8217;ve ever witnessed. As if I didn&#8217;t already have issues with marriage (for myself), witnessing Dory&#8217;s pseudo-theatrical fate was enough to convince me that marriage is something I just don&#8217;t want to deal with &#8212; stag parties are just plain cruel.<br />
Dory wasn&#8217;t in the best of shape after that. The six shots of whatever had taken their toll. Stuart and I stuck around to see if Dory was okay (after he made quick trip to the Men&#8217;s Room). The party packed up about then, with most disappearing to another strip club in town, Dave and Wayne taking Dory back to Hugh&#8217;s place to recover, and Stuart and I returning to Calgary.<br />
I can safely say that I&#8217;ve been there and done that. Whatever infinitesimally small interest I might have had was thoroughly squashed in less than 30 minutes. With luck, I won&#8217;t have to do that again.<br />
Ever.</p>

		<p>A little over two months ago, Dave &#8220;36&#8221; Chambers left Calgary for Toronto, where we were opening another office. On Friday, he came back to visit, and it was up to us to remind him why it was (or wasn&#8217;t) a bad idea to leave.<br />
This was a weekend for travelling &#8212; many CMassers were moving about the country. Some were coming to Calgary, some were going to Toronto, but most (of the travellers) were going to Vancouver for a wedding. Shawn was Toronto-bound, conveniently about 45 minutes after Dave&#8217;s plane was to land. Making my trip completely useful, I took Shawn to the airport, he tagged off with Dave, and I took Dave back to our place.<br />
For a game night of near-epic proportions.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A lot of people give Calgary a hard time. They call it &#8220;Cowtown&#8221;. They think that we&#8217;re overrun with cowboys and horses. They think everyone has a shotgun rack in their beat-up pickup truck. They think that most of people who live here are intolerant hicks with nothing better to do than pick fights every night. They think it&#8217;s really cold year-round. They think there&#8217;s no culture.<br />
The problem is that people don&#8217;t think. They accept without question.<br />
These were stories I&#8217;d heard before moving here, so I too was guilty of not asking questions. I didn&#8217;t know much about Calgary before I first came here in September 1997. My first exposure to Calgary was an eye-opening one &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t expected such a young city. Both Gerry and I recognized that almost immediately, and how much we suddenly felt the urge to move here.<br />
As it stands, I moved to Vancouver and Gerry moved to Bermuda. But now I&#8217;m here, and in the last year I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit about this city. It&#8217;s time to dispell a few myths.<br />
Myth #1: Calgary is full of cowboys.<br />
There are two times this is actually true. First, during the Calgary Stampede. This is when the only way you can tell the city folk from cow pokes is by how clean and pressed the clothes are. The only other time this is true is when some of them gets lost, and somehow finds their way downtown. It&#8217;s rare, but it&#8217;s been known to happen from time to time. (For all we know, it could just be part of an ad campaign.)<br />
Oh, and then there&#8217;s patrons of Cowboys, Desperados, and Outlaws, three of the western-themed bars in town. But those are usually drunk jocks.<br />
Myth #2: Most people who live here are intolerant hicks.<br />
Most of the people who live in this city moved from other provinces (of all the people I&#8217;ve met here, only about 10 are native Calgarians). Many are from back east. We have the youngest demographic of any city in Canada &#8212; the average age is 33.7 (as of 1996, down from 34.5 in 1991), while the Canadian average was 35.8. Also, over 50% of our residents have a post-secondary education of some form.<br />
We also have a lot of rich people. It&#8217;s that black, oily stuff they keep finding out here. There are a large number of people who&#8217;ve made small (and large) fortunes off it. Of course, you can&#8217;t spot some of these people &#8212; they look completely ordinary. That is, until they climb into their Mercedes, BMWs, Porches (although they&#8217;re not as popular out here), high-end SUVs, and expensive Japanese imports.<br />
If there are hicks here, they&#8217;re keeping a mighty low profile.<br />
Myth #3: It&#8217;s cold year-round.<br />
No, it&#8217;s *dry* here year-round. Our altitude, combined with a lack of suitably large body of water (the Bow River certainly does not count) keeps us gulping liquids and using moisturizers more than most people. But there is an upside to all that &#8212; the driness cuts down on the cold. Without moisture to cut through our clothes, a heavy shirt, fleece, and windbreaker can get you though weather that freezes people to death back in southern Ontario.<br />
The downside, of course, is that when we go to more humid climates without suitable protection, we freeze even in what others consider comfortable weather.<br />
Sure we do have winter from as early as late October through to as late as early June (worst-case scenario), but we also get Chinooks all year (yes, we get Chinooks in the summer, too, but they&#8217;re not as pronounced as in the winter), so even in the dead of winter, when others are digging themselves out of 10 feet of snow, we could be wearing shorts on the skihills.<br />
Myth #4: There&#8217;s no culture; there&#8217;s nothing to do.<br />
This is the single largest myth, and it&#8217;s one that many transplanted Calgarians continue. Calgary isn&#8217;t like Vancouver, or Toronto, or Montreal. In those cities, you can&#8217;t avoid things to do &#8212; they&#8217;re in your face 24-7. But out here, people aren&#8217;t interested in that kind of constant bombardment. We have a large theatre scene &#8212; we have a complex here that I haven&#8217;t seen in either Toronto or Vancouver. We have a large concert hall, and several stadiums perfectly capable of holding concerts or sports, depending on your fancy.<br />
And then, of course, there&#8217;s the outdoors. I would love to know what the population of the city drops to during the summer, when almost everyone ducks out for the wilderness. You can&#8217;t get a camping spot in this province on any long weekend &#8230; not without either booking months (and I mean *months*) in advance, or staking out a spot (in the non-reservable grounds) days ahead.<br />
Okay, still not impressed? I left this one for last, because even I have trouble believing it. Calgary has a skatepark, called the Shaw Millennium Skatepark. This is a concrete playground built specifically for the skateboarding population of our city &#8212; a place where they can go and grind to their heart&#8217;s content, without any fear that some security guard will interrupt their fun.<br />
This park was built by the city (with funds from local companies, such as Shaw Cable), is open 24 hours a day, and completely free. Chris, Stuart, and I went over to it on Saturday night to get a close look and see what it was all about. It&#8217;s quite large, and well-built (at least from a skateboarder&#8217;s perspective). It allows kids to do whatever they want, and hang out with people like themselves. And even at midnight, there are kids of all ages practicing, showing off, and hanging out.<br />
It&#8217;s just west of the downtown core, wedged between 6th and 9th Avenues, far enough away from condos to not bother residents, but close enough so the kids can still get there. I can&#8217;t think of another city that has something similar in its downtown. Stuart was quick to point out that Toronto would find some way to turn it into a golf course. Vancouver would build a condo, and then charge $150,000 for a 400 square foot bachelor.<br />
I hope that in some small way, I might have changed your view of Calgary. Although different from other large cities in Canada, it&#8217;s no less a fine place to live. I offer anyone the chance to come here and see for yourself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was once said that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fear is the oppressor of souls and nations. It is the beginnings of hatred and suffering. And it&#8217;s what has kept me away from Vancouver. Fear of my past. Fear of opening old wounds.<br />
This is why on Friday past, one year, two months, and four days since I left Vancouver, that I felt it was time to face those fears.<br />
Well, actually, it was a month earlier that I made the decision, but you get my point&#8230;<br />
It basically stemmed from one email I received from my friend Greg, suggesting I come out to see a baseball game in Seattle with some of my former co-workers (and current friends) from Radical. It was part spur-of-the-moment, part &#8220;I really need to get out of this office for a couple days!&#8221;, but when it really came down to it, it was time for me to go back.<br />
I&#8217;d had the opportunity a couple times before, the most recent previous one being an invitation to Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;Glug&#8221; party, a tradition she and Guy have at Christmas. However, I&#8217;d never really felt ready. I had always said I was busy (which was true), but primarily, I knew that mentally and emotionally, I hadn&#8217;t forced off my demons &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t ready to go back.<br />
Rising early on Friday, I made my way to the airport to catch my 7:50am flight to Vancouver. I took public transit, partly for the heck of it, and partly so I&#8217;d get a better idea of times for the next time I do this. Not having the best information available on times and schedules, I ended up with about 20 minutes to wait for the bus once I&#8217;d reached the end of the C-Train line.<br />
I watched the sun rise above the houses, casting long shadows across the bus terminal, and shedding light on a dawn of reawakening. (It&#8217;s amazing the stuff you can dish out when you&#8217;re being philosophical, eh?) It was my first real thoughts about what I was about to do. Would I run into my past, and would she confront me? Would I see any of her friends? And more importantly, what would I do? These were questions I was unable to answer, even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about that very thing for over a year.<br />
Soon I found myself at the airport, awaiting the boarding for the flight. Unlike my previous flights with Air Canada (see [[Christmas in Oakville, New Years Eve in Calgary]]), this flight left right on time. The flight was uneventful &#8212; up, breakfast, read, down. All told, about an hour and 10 minutes.<br />
Descending into Vancouver was &#8230; weird. I recognized everything. Surrey, Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, the Port Mann Bridge, Metrotown, the Richmond Auto Mall, IKEA. It almost felt like I&#8217;d never left, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling. Something between excitement and knowing you&#8217;re being watched.<br />
BC Transit being on strike, I had to take a taxi to get out of the airport. (Although Greg had offered to pick me up, I had told him not to waste his time &#8212; I knew he already had a killer schedule, and going to the airport is quite a bit out of his way.) The trip was quite, pleasant, and a brisk drive down memory lane. In less than 20 minutes, I was standing on the corner of 10th and Granville, wondering what I was going to do next.<br />
The first thing I did was call Lee, who had been Radical&#8217;s Director of QA and the coach of the Rad Sox. Being already at work, we agreed to meet that night, as planned, at Soho&#8217;s in Yaletown. I so proceeded to step #2 &#8212; wait. I wanted to hold off until about 9:30 before calling Katrina (another friend and former co-worker), but I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her too early in the morning. (More on this in a few paragraphs.)<br />
So it was off to one of a thousand local Starbuck&#8217;s to indulge in my second hot chocolate of the morning (the first being at the Blenz in Calgary airport). I sat, sipping my venti, and really thought about where I was. I actually sat with my back to the door, a little worried about who might walk through it.<br />
Irrational fears are the worst kind.<br />
After pondering the state of affairs for about a half hour (ventis are pretty big), I retreated to the moist Vancouver air, and proceeded to contact Katrina. I had hoped to meet up with her that morning, as I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I was going to do that day. I had originally hoped to meet up with Lee for coffee, and then visit with Katrina later that morning. However, things don&#8217;t always go according to plan &#8212; Katrina was busy getting all the things she and her husband needed to pack everything in their home so they could move to San Francisco.<br />
I sat next to Katrina for two years. She&#8217;s one of the people I miss most about Vancouver, along with several of my co-workers. They were what made my life there happier than it would have been. But now Katrina was also an ex-Radicalite, and moving on with her life by accepting a position at Pixar. Yes, the same people who brought you the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies and &#8220;A Bug&#8217;s Life&#8221;. Not only am I impressed, but I can actually say I know someone at Pixar. This was too cool.<br />
Resigning myself to having a morning on my own, I proceeded to run errands. First was a quick stop to the bank to deposit a rebate cheque (I had to deposit it in person, and getting to the bank during the day ain&#8217;t easy). I then stopped quickly at Bernard Callebaut to pick up some chocolates as a kind of &#8220;bon voyage&#8221; present for Katrina and Guy.<br />
Then I wandered. I wander well, particularly when I have nothing else to do, and I know (more or less) where I&#8217;m going.<br />
I headed towards downtown along Granville. I decided I wanted to go to Burrard Inlet and look around. It wasn&#8217;t a great day &#8212; the sky was overcast and I was being spit on periodically from above &#8212; but it was good day for looking around. But being in a wandering mood, I made a side trip through Granville Island, one of my favourite places in the city.<br />
On my way in, I stopped to donate some spare change to Jack &#8220;The Bear&#8221;, a self-employed social worker who strives to make his &#8220;group&#8221; (whomever they are) better off. I&#8217;d seen and heard of this guy before, and not being in a rush, I allowed myself (somewhat unwittingly) to end up in a half-hour pseudo-speech. He&#8217;s an articulate man, and he certainly has some interesting ideas. I tried to offer a few suggestions (his ideas, though good, need the odd improvement), but getting a word in edgewise is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s easier sliding papers between the blocks of the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<br />
I wandered about the Island a bit, and went into the market. They say that smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. The second I walked in the door, it felt like someone was force feeding me 1,000 TV channels at once as snippets of two years suddenly raced through my mind. Some good, some bad &#8230; but after a moment, all I could smell was the produce, and food is always good. It took a lot of will power to get out of the market without buying anything.<br />
I exited the Island via the Aquabus, which ferried me to the other side of False Creek. This was far better than walking all the way back to the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, and then walking all the way back downtown again. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed how much I missed the smell of the sea, not until I got near the water. The smell is unmistakable, and wonderful. I think I was a fish in a previous life&#8230;<br />
The wandering continued as I worked my way down Granville. Not much had changed &#8212; same stores, same buildings, even some of the same people. The city line had a few new condos, and there was the odd old building reduced to a parking lot, but otherwise it was the same. Tagging (a form of graffiti) was very prevalent, especially at the Paradise and Caprice theatres (both now closed). Not unsurprising, I hate to say. The Eaton&#8217;s was open again. A new pub sat kiddie-corner, which had been abandoned or under construction during the entire time I was in Vancouver. A new London Drugs is open at the corner of Granville and Georgia. It used to be book store, which went under when Chapters moved into town. The London Drugs had moved from its old store further down the road, now open to anyone silly enough to lease the space.<br />
Canada Place was seeing some new construction. I had vaguely remembered a plan to expand the pier to increase convention space. The plan, it seemed, was thoroughly under way. As such, my favourite vantage point to view Burrard Inlet was unavailable. Instead, I took up a viewpoint on the promenade between Waterfront Station and the Province&#8217;s building.<br />
Although the view was essentially the same as the last time I&#8217;d viewed it, something seemed different. Not as much life &#8212; it seemed almost a little dead. I don&#8217;t know if it was a changed perspective due to my departure a year earlier, or if it was the weather. It almost looked like someone had dropped out some of the colour from the image I was seeing.<br />
I was still a little afraid, I think.<br />
Through Waterfront Station, and onto Water Street, I walked through Gastown. Not much had changed there, either. A couple stores had moved, a couple closed, and one lot (or building, I&#8217;m not sure which) had been opened up. I think there had been a restaurant there once, but I can&#8217;t really remember. The same burned out husk of a building sat across the street from the Olde Spaghetti Factory, though the structure supports had been beefed up a lot. I shook my head, wondering what on earth was going on there.<br />
I turned up Carrall Street, and headed back towards False Creek, Science World glinting in the distance. In moments, I realized that I&#8217;d made a bit of a blunder. This is what I get for pondering and not paying attention. I found myself at the corner of Carrall and W. Hastings. It&#8217;s known as Pigeon Park, and has the highest murder rate of any location in Canada. It&#8217;s not pleasant during the day &#8230; but you don&#8217;t go near it at night. I briskly walked through and on across the road. I didn&#8217;t feel safer until a couple of blocks later.<br />
I stalled a bit longer (I wasn&#8217;t due at Radical until almost 1pm) and made a side trip through the International Village, a large mall, still mostly empty over a year and a half since it opened. It looks really nice, but I wonder how much money they must lose from the lack of tenants.<br />
Up Abbott, I arrived at Pacific. This took me over towards Quebec Street, and onto Terminal Avenue. I was in the home stretch. Aside from Greg, I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone from Radical in over a year. Fear was rapidly being overcome by nervous combination of excitement and panic.<br />
My first run-in was with Fernando and one of the Foundation developers, whose name I couldn&#8217;t remember, even though he started at Radical the same day I did (my panic began to rise as I realized I couldn&#8217;t remember names). A few moments later, I entered the foyer of Radical&#8217;s new home, and headed right to the top floor.<br />
The receptionist I didn&#8217;t recognize. Lisa was gone, so I find out, having quit back in the summer. Greg could not be found, nor could Joel. Luckily, we could find Neall. As I waited for him to arrive, I heard my name being called by Allison. She had also started the same day as me, but unlike myself, was quite comfortable at her job. She looked good as ever, and still bore the same wonderful smile she always seemed to have.<br />
Neall hadn&#8217;t changed much, either &#8212; though I was just as happy to see him again. The reunions started to come quickly as Dave appeared through the main door, and Fred from the back office. Names were flitting around in my head so fast, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I nearly forgot Fred&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Neall offered to take me on a quick tour, and show me what Radical had moved in to. Having used up all their old space, Radical had taken a lease in a near-brand new building, and had the interior made up to their specifications. It&#8217;s quite nice, really &#8230; especially the log cabin in the common room.<br />
Yes, a log cabin. It&#8217;s their home theatre. I&#8217;ve seen and heard of some pretty wacky things in companies, but this is one of the wackiest. The common room at Radical is two stories tall, and easily big enough to fit a small house. It also has a 270+ degree view of Vancouver, including what must be a magnificent view of the North Shore.<br />
A new building, but it wasn&#8217;t much different than the old building &#8212; totally organic space, managers in the middle, work teams scattered around the outside. Greg had commented that Critical Mass&#8217; building looks more polished, but for the environment, I know a lot of people here would prefer Radical&#8217;s setup.<br />
Eric was still in a dungeon. This is where he likes to be &#8212; in the dark, away from everyone. I assume it lets him get on with his work. Martin was with him, discussing physics calculations. Mark was in the office he shared with Neall, looking none the worse for wear. Across from the office was Jean-Luc and Senta (whose name I sadly forgot, and I felt like such a heel for forgetting it), and a desk away was Nigel. He summed up my return rather succinctly: &#8220;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&#8221;<br />
Down the floor, I ran into Lisa (the office manager) and Cliff (one of the IT guys). I inadvertently interrupted their conversation, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much. Neall took me down a floor to show me around a bit more. There were a lot of familiar faces, but many of them without names. I was now feeling particularly bad about forgetting so many people. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I remembered Yayoi&#8217;s and Rod&#8217;s names, something I&#8217;m not horribly proud of. Jesse seemed a bit surprised to see me, but then I don&#8217;t think he knew I was coming out.<br />
Returning to the seventh floor, I finally found Greg. He immediately started to apologize for not being around. Greg was up to his neck in E3 preparations. The game he&#8217;s working on has to be down there for exhibition, and there were still a lot of issues to clear up. Although it had been planned a month in advance, I hadn&#8217;t picked the best weekend to come out.<br />
Just before lunch, I finally ran into Tim, my old boss. He&#8217;s now one of the VPs (Neall is now the head of Pure3D), although I don&#8217;t know of what specifically. He had always been a fairly serious person while I was there, but he seemed somehow happier. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the haircut, but he looked better off.<br />
Members of Pure3D (Neall, Mark, Nigel) and Pure3D alumni (Kevin, Greg, Gabe, and myself) all went out for lunch, to a place called The Whip. (Gabe picked us up; like me, Gabe is also an ex-Radicalite.) It seemed somehow wrong that we weren&#8217;t eating anything Asian. Pure3D ritual had been typically Chinese. This was definitely not Chinese &#8230; although it was very tasty. The conversation, though, was definitely Pure3D.<br />
The more things change&#8230;<br />
After lunch, I finally met up with Joel. He&#8217;d been a bit of a harder character to find, being the lead programmer for one of Radical&#8217;s projects (meetings being the bane of his existence). He looked tired, like everyone else on the team. Being sick probably didn&#8217;t help much, either. We talked for a while, but I chose to keep the conversation fairly short, as he was busy dealing with the crises of getting a game ready for E3.<br />
I took the opportunity to leave Radical and go visit with Katrina and Guy. By now, it was raining outside, so I was quite happy to find the Aquabus still running between Science World and Stamp&#8217;s Landing, where Katrina and Guy live. They were home, and it only took a few moments (with a bit of direction) to get down to their slip.<br />
Oh, did I mention they live on a sailboat?<br />
This was why it was so difficult for them to get ready to move. Not only do they have to pack their belongings, they have to move their house as well. Logically, not an easy move. But they seemed fairly calm about it &#8212; most people get downright cranky when they move.<br />
I spent most of the afternoon with them, talking for a while, but them helping them pack. It was partly because I wanted to get the skinny on their move. It had come out of nowhere (at least from my perspective), and I was very curious to get their thoughts on it. They were excited. New place, new challenges, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Not wanting to get in their way of packing, I&#8217;d also offered to help them pack. Katrina and I spent the afternoon wrapping things in bubble wrap.<br />
I probably stayed longer than I really should have, but I felt compelled to not just drop in for a few minutes and then bolt. After all, I&#8217;d spent two years sitting next to Katrina, working with her, talking with her, and learning from her. Besides, until I go to San Francisco, I don&#8217;t know when (or even if) I&#8217;ll ever see her again.<br />
At 7:00, all three of us had to leave. Katrina and Guy were going to a friend&#8217;s place, and I was due to go to SoHo&#8217;s and meet up with Lee (and hopefully, people whose names I could remember). Despite being nearly 40 minutes late by the time I got there, I was the first to show. (Hopefully, we didn&#8217;t scare off any other potential revellers.) The second person to arrive was Ryan, a Radicalite whom I wasn&#8217;t sure was there to come out with us, or was meeting other friends. Luckily, he remembered me, and reintroduced himself. I was glad, because even when I was at Radical, I really didn&#8217;t know who he was&#8230;<br />
We talked at length until Lee arrived. You&#8217;d swear no time had passed since the last time I&#8217;d seen her. She didn&#8217;t look a day older, and was just as upfront as ever, just the way we love her. It didn&#8217;t take long for any awkwardness to pass. Soon, we were embroiled in animated conversation, along with one of Lee&#8217;s co-workers, who had also come out. Not too many Radicalites (ex or otherwise) came out that night, although I was very happy to see Lisa (the ex-receptionist) again. I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d gotten along with her very well, and had missed saying &#8220;hi&#8221; to her every morning.<br />
Somewhere in the evening, I stopped looking over my shoulder. I stopped looking in the shadows. I stopped being apprehensive. It was like I suddenly knew the story, like I&#8217;d already seen the movie and knew exactly when the creepy, half-dead monster leaps out. It was like the fear had dissipated like morning fog. Sure, the past will always be there, but spending the day in Vancouver, and with my friends, had shown me there was nothing to fear. It was only then that I truly felt relaxed.<br />
Neall appeared around 10:30, and joined our little group. Greg made a brief appearance, only to apologize for not coming out. The debate of where I would stay that night (begun earlier in the day) apparently had been solved &#8212; Neall would drop me off at Mark&#8217;s on our way home in preparation for the next day. This left Greg to quickly go to a friend&#8217;s birthday party, catch a few hours sleep, and get back to work early the next day. Sadly, because of the deadline, Greg wasn&#8217;t coming with us.<br />
Neall and I finally managed to leave SoHo&#8217;s around 12:30. I gave Lee a big hug (we&#8217;d had a good, deep conversation for most of the night, and I remembered all over again why I missed being around people like her), and stepped out into the cool night. Neall and I walked back to Radical, enjoying the walk, and talking about the state of Radical. It was refreshing to see how things had evolved since I&#8217;d left. It was very reassuring to see that management (including Neall, now that&#8217;s he&#8217;s part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;) still has a firm grip and good steer of the Good Ship Radical.<br />
Fires were raging when we got into the office. A Pure3D patch hadn&#8217;t taken well, and Neall had to help out Vlad (the technical director) to get the software working again. Also, we were giving Eric a lift, and he was still working out a few issues with a demo he was programming. (He&#8217;d been at it since late Wednesday, I believe &#8230; non-stop. He hadn&#8217;t gone home.) Due to these reasons, we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. This also meant I was now staying at Neall&#8217;s, because it was now too late to go to Mark&#8217;s.<br />
I crashed on Neall&#8217;s couch that night. I was exhausted. I&#8217;d been up for just about 23 hours straight since that morning, walked about 10 kilometres since that morning, ate almost nothing outside of a sandwich at lunch, and was ready to fall dead. I was asleep in seconds.<br />
The alarm came far too early for my liking. But we had to get rolling fast &#8212; we had a baseball game to go to. Although the game didn&#8217;t start until 1:05pm, we had to pick up Neall&#8217;s sister, drive to Mark&#8217;s, pick up Gabe, and then drive to Seattle. It&#8217;s not a long drive, but it still takes time. Although we moved as fast as possible, we were delayed by a mysterious case of nose bleed, which I have yet to explain. (It plagued me the entire weekend.)<br />
After a slight detour to pick up Angie (Neall&#8217;s sister), we arrived at Mark and Carol&#8217;s to switch to a different vehicle. Our trip to Seattle would be in style &#8212; a Warner Brothers edition Chevy Venture. Nothing like being able to play video games and watch movies during the trip. Then it was off through to the west end of Richmond to pick up Gabe. It was almost 10am by the time we were all on our way to the border.<br />
We arrived in Seattle around noon. Mark deftly whizzed us through the various onramps and city streets towards the Port of Seattle, where Safeco Field lies. (It&#8217;s adjacent to the site of the former Kingdome, now the site of the new football stadium.) You can&#8217;t miss Safeco Field &#8212; it&#8217;s big. And it&#8217;s colour is unique for the area it sits in. There I found that Carol wasn&#8217;t joining the game with us &#8212; she was going shopping while we enjoyed America&#8217;s pastime. Unfortunately, that also meant she took the van with her, which contained my jacket. (Upon hopping out, Gabe and I declared that it was warm enough to go without jackets &#8212; Angie and Mark were far wiser, and Neall had a heavy shirt.)<br />
Safeco Field, although new and (assumedly) state-of-the-art, was built in the tradition of the great baseball fields: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. It&#8217;s also a dedicated baseball stadium &#8212; no other sports (or events, as near as I can tell) occupy the space. The field is grass, and the stands are open to the wind &#8212; only the roof rolls shut to block out the rain (important on the West Coast).<br />
Our seats were at first base, about 20 rows up. Aside from the overhang of the upper deck which blocked the view of some of the flies, they were great seats. We were also one row away from the promenade, where we could find virtually any snack food imaginable, including the ubiquitous hot dogs, but also garlic fries, fish and chips, clam chowder, hamburgers, pizza &#8230; and all by local companies, no McDonald&#8217;s or Versa Foods here.<br />
This was Game 2 in a series between the Mariners and the Blue Jays. The last time I&#8217;d seen a Blue Jays game was about 10 years ago in Skydome, though it might have been 11 &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen so many, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Almost all of my Jays games had been courtesy of a family friend, Mr. Gairdner, who offered us his season tickets from time to time. I had forgotten in those years just how much fun professional baseball really is.<br />
Well, when you&#8217;re not freezing to death.<br />
I made one major mistake. I left my jacket in the car. I should have been smart and brought it with me. But no, I thought I was fine. Stupid me. I forgot that I was on the West Coast, where the humidity is much higher. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that until the temperature rises into the low 20s (Celsius, of course), it will always be cold for me in the more humid regions of the world. Living in Calgary has dried me out, and my immunity to the cold seems to have waned. I can hack -20 degree weather here quite easily. But minus six in Toronto was brutal at Christmas (I wasn&#8217;t even phased by -20 when I used to live in Ontario), and I was finding that even 13 degrees in Seattle was cold, especially with the wind. I chose to put up with the chilliness, rather than fork out the money for a Mariner&#8217;s jacket&#8230;<br />
The opening ceremonies were a different spin on what I remember from Toronto. Like the Hitmen games I&#8217;d seen last month, Major League Baseball now has games to entertain viewers &#8212; kids&#8217; home run derbies, and pitching contests. Personally, I think it cheapens the game, reducing the game to almost something of a sideshow.<br />
What impressed me was the singing of the national anthems. They brought in the Walla Walla High School Chamber Group. Although American, they sung perhaps the most amazing rendition of &#8220;O Canada&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever heard. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Mark was the only one of us who sang along &#8230; I usually don&#8217;t because my singing usually sends people running for dear life. The choir&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; was, sadly, typically American &#8212; seldom sung the way it was written. There are times I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m Canadian, where our national anthem is sung only two ways, English and French, and is always the same length.<br />
I&#8217;m not entire sure how many Canadians were there that day (we saw a few Canadian flags floating around), but there was a fair bit of cheering when Toronto took the field. Understandably, though, the cheering was much louder when Seattle came out &#8230; especially for their right fielder, Ichiro Suzuki. He&#8217;s one of two Japanese players with Seattle, and both are immensely popular, the other being closing pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki. They&#8217;re good players &#8212; Ichiro hits a mean ball, and Kazuhiro throws a pretty vicious pitch.<br />
The game was tight &#8212; a couple home runs, some really great fielding, good solid hits, and the odd error made for some really good drama. I remembered watching the World Series back in 1992 in the townhouse I shared with roommates Roger, Ed, and Brian, screaming at the mistakes and groaning every hit the Braves made during the sixth game of the World Series, only to later wake the dead (along with everyone else in the complex) as the Jays went onto victory.<br />
Different team, different city, different opponents, and not even a championship on the line &#8230; the emotions were all the same. We all huffed at missed chances, cheered for the really good plays, and whined when the Mariners scored. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a blow-out for either team &#8212; a good solid race clear through. The only way I would&#8217;ve enjoyed it more was if I&#8217;d been warmer.<br />
By the seventh inning, I was chilled to the bone. Neall noticed my sad plight, and literally gave me the shirt off his back. I knew the four of them were laughing me &#8212; admittedly, I was laughing at myself. Once upon a time, the cold didn&#8217;t bother me. I hate to admit it, but I&#8217;m a damp weather wimp now.<br />
The game ended on a down note &#8212; the Jays lost 7-5. After watching the roof close (which is a bit of spectacle in itself), we worked our way out and tried to meet up with Carol. The only problem was navigating through the 42,000 other fans who were doing roughly the same thing. Fortunately for us, Carol and I were both equipped with cell phones, so after a few conversations, we managed to all meet up.<br />
Departing the port, we headed into the downtown area, to Pioneer Square, and the Elliott Bay Book Store. This is perhaps the coolest book store I&#8217;ve ever been in. It&#8217;s huge &#8212; about the size of a chapters, only with more books. And it&#8217;s in (what I would assume to be) a heritage building. Being from Alberta, buying books in the States doesn&#8217;t really save me any money, so I just took the time to look around.<br />
Hunger soon had it&#8217;s call, though, and we were off in search of food. Unfortunately, no-one was particularly helpful in deciding where to go. We drove somewhat aimlessly around Seattle trying to find a place to eat, all the while asking &#8220;where are we going?&#8221;. We ultimately ended up at 13 Coins, a restaurant Mark had learned about in a travel guide.<br />
One day, I will finally obtain proof that the restaurants that appear in travel guides are only there because the restaurateurs bribed the author. Of all the so-called great places to eat that I&#8217;ve read about, only a couple were actually good. Unfortunately, 13 Coins wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
This place had decor that even Elvis would be terrified of. I was convinced that someone had loved the 70s so much, that they refused to redecorate with anything less awful. But when you take into account the &#8220;cheese factor&#8221; of such a place, it&#8217;s kind of interesting &#8230; for a novelty, that is.<br />
The quality of the food, so I&#8217;ve found, usually matches the decor. And believe me, it was pretty darn hard to find something on the menu that I wanted to eat. (Mind you, it was mostly because I was still full from the hot dog, chicken strips and fries, and the tepidly bland hot chocolate I&#8217;d had at Safeco Field.) I settled on a Philadelphia Steak Sandwich, which turned out to be a small piece of beef on garlic toast. Not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse.<br />
The trip back to Vancouver was marked with the showing of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. (Note to self: Make sure there is a video system in my next car.) Despite it being one of my favourite movies, I still fell asleep for about an hour or so. The movie ended just as we were pulling into Richmond, and dropped off Gabe. The next stop was at Radical, where I was going to meet up with Greg. I grabbed all my things (I&#8217;d brought my bag with me), and said goodbye. I called up to Greg, who came down to let me in. A quick thumbs-up sent Mark, Carol, Neall, and Angie off into the night.<br />
Greg, along with several of his team members, were hard at work on their game. It was going to be a late night, which Greg immediately started apologizing for. But frankly, I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out at Radical. I always liked hanging out there, even when I was the only one. It was a fun company, and near as I can tell, still is. Greg and I struck a happy medium &#8212; while he coded, I would test.<br />
So for the next four hours, I played a game that no-one will see for about four months. And no, I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it. I will say this &#8212; it&#8217;s a LOT of fun. Greg, like most of the programmers I worked with at Radical, are wizards &#8212; they can churn out some of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen or played. This game was no different. Although it won&#8217;t set any new standards for graphics, the game play is outstanding &#8230; definitely better than another game that will ultimately be compared so when it finally ships.<br />
The game doesn&#8217;t wrap up until early August. So why the crunch in early May? The Electronic Entertainment Exposition, known as E3, which is in mid-May. This is when all the Christmas games first appear. This is when game companies try to outdo each other. This is *the* event if you work in the video game industry. And this game is debuting there. Like any good video game project, they were under the gun to tweak enough stuff to make it play really well, and make a lot of people very jealous.<br />
Personally, I think they nailed it perfectly.<br />
Somewhere around 2am, Greg and I headed out for his place in very east Burnaby. We stayed up for a short while and talked, but we were both so tired, we opted for sleep instead.<br />
Sunday morning came around 9:30. I was still exhausted from the day before, but rose and showered and prepared for the day. Not there was much to prepare for &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much on the agenda. A quick breakfast at IHOP, and we went back into the office. We weren&#8217;t there too long, as I had to go to the airport. This time, Greg drove me out, which I was thankful for (the transit strike makes getting a taxi outside of the airport rather difficult). I bid him farewell, he drove back to work, and I checked in for the flight.<br />
I slept on the way back, though not intentionally. I was utterly wiped. I hadn&#8217;t been so active in so long that my body simply wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I vaguely remember something about 35,000 feet, and something about returning my seat to its original upright position. Next thing I knew, I was hopping the bus home. And as we all know, home is where the heart, bed, and 50&#8243; TV are. This was where I was determined to spend the next several hours &#8230; sleeping.<br />
Unfortunately, it seemed that my vacation would be cut short. Crisis at Critical Mass &#8212; the site I was working on had basically fallen apart in my absence. Somehow, I&#8217;d become the centre of communications, and without me around, everything came to a halt. I didn&#8217;t get home until 1:30am.<br />
I look back at my weekend, and I actually have to force myself to believe I was actually there. With all the apprehension I had towards going back, I now find it hard to believe I did it. But I know I did, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad I saw my friends again (despite the fact that I feel like a twit for forgetting names). I&#8217;m glad I saw a Blue Jays game (even though they lost). But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that my past is now just that &#8212; behind me. All that&#8217;s left is the possibility of the future.<br />
Vancouver is a destination for me. Not to live, but certainly to visit. I will see sights I never saw, I will do things I never got the chance to do. I&#8217;m content that no matter what I see and do, it was because of me (with a lot of support from my family and friends) that I&#8217;m capable of doing it. And so long as I know people in Vancouver, or at least have an inkling of a reason, I will go there, and I will enjoy myself each and every minute.<br />
At least when it isn&#8217;t raining.</p>

		<p>Someone&#8217;s out to get me, I swear. Unfortunately, that someone is probably me.<br />
This has got to have been one of the most hectic weekends I can remember. Here&#8217;s the general gist of some of the things that were going on:</p>
<ol>
<li>A project deadline (for our largest client) that was due yesterday.</li>
<li>Several planned family meals.</li>
<li>My mother&#8217;s birthday.</li>
<li>A friend in town.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know it doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but the overall effect was unbelievably distressing, and the victims ended up being my mother, my father, and myself. My father, you ask? Well, I just came the realization that today is his birthday, and I forgot to call. (I have a lame excuse &#8212; I dropped my cell phone the other day, and the antenna broke, pretty much rendering it useless until I get it fixed. I haven&#8217;t had the time to get it fixed yet.) So dad, I apologize for not calling &#8212; I&#8217;ll make an effort to call tomorrow.<br />
The weekend started on Thursday night, with another Hitmen hockey game. I&#8217;ll have to dispense with the details, as much as I would love to recount the game &#8212; it was a thrilling one. It was the first night in a while that I had left the office early. Even without the game, I still would have left &#8212; the power was being shut off to install our server room UPS system. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know what a UPS is, it&#8217;s basically a giant battery.)<br />
The next morning (after attempting to catch up on the weeks of sleep I&#8217;ve managed to fall behind on) Chris and I went over to my cousin Pam&#8217;s new home for a massive family brunch. This included my aunt, uncle, and cousin from Calgary, Pam and her parents, Pam&#8217;s aunt and uncle (who also live in Calgary), her boyfriend, our grandmother (Nana), and my mother, who had flown out to Calgary for Easter. It was also her birthday, which her brother was all too willing to bring to light.<br />
Brunch was huge &#8212; lots of fruit, pastries, eggs, bacon, a spinach pie that was to die for, and champagne and orange juice. It didn&#8217;t take long for Chris and I (and just about everyone else) to overfill. Yes, it was going to be another one of &#8220;those&#8221; weekends (see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]]) &#8212; non-stop food. Luckily for me, I was going to be locking myself in the office, keeping me from eating too much &#8230; in theory, anyway.<br />
Around 1pm, Chris and I made our exit. I had to go to work to work on the aforementioned project deadline. But first, I had to swing by Chinook Centre to get mom a birthday present. No, I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get her one yet &#8212; and my previous attempts had yielded no fruit. Success was not far away, however, and I was soon heading back towards the office.<br />
I worked away until almost 5:45, at which point I had to leave to go to dinner at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s, in honour of my mother&#8217;s birthday. I made a quick side trip by the Greyhound station to drop off Carl (Critical Mass&#8217;s newest Web Developer) so he could go to Invermere, and then stopped by the apartment to pick up the photographs of Julie&#8217;s wedding (which had been meant to show around, but in the chaos of returning from Ontario after Christmas, disappeared into the &#8220;Behind The Couch&#8221; void).<br />
Almost 45 minutes late arriving, the six of us (my aunt, uncle, cousin Jen, Nana, my mom, and me) had a wonderful dinner. The centrepiece was a Cajun marinated steak, served with a fruit salsa that made the flavours just pop out. I never thought fruit could be used so cleverly.<br />
Around 10pm, my body was screaming for rest. I withdrew my presence and retreated to the comforts of my apartment, where I attempted to fall asleep in front of the TV. However, I was at that uncomfortable point in exhaustion where you&#8217;re actually too tired to sleep. I stayed that way until Chris came home from his almost-but-not-quite date, and suggested we go to Pongo for a while.<br />
I gotta learn to stop doing stuff like that when I&#8217;m exhausted.<br />
The next morning came far too early, despite being noon. I felt like I&#8217;d only slept an hour. But back to the office I went. I slaved away until about 3:30, when I returned home to prepare for the next round of family engagements. We were off to Ron and Dawn&#8217;s home (my aunt Alaine&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law) for a pre-dinner get-together. I was pleasantly surprised to see Jen in attendance &#8212; I had assumed she wouldn&#8217;t have come. But Jen, unlike myself at her age, is quite willing to experiment with new foods.<br />
We hobnobbed until 7:15, at which time we headed en masse to Bodega, a Spanish tapas bar about four blocks from our apartment. I&#8217;d been there one time before, on a pseudo-business lunch, when our office had literally been around the corner. It was an excellent meal, and I was looking forward to having it again.<br />
All 17 of us piled into the little restaurant, taking up a large (and loud) portion of the tables. For the next four hours or so, we ate, talked, drank, shared in Jen&#8217;s drawings (my cousin is becoming quite the artist, and is adept at on-the-spot works of art), and were merry. For a short while, I forgot how tired I really was.<br />
When we finally left (in the vicinity of 11:15pm), I returned to the apartment to pass out. Chris again tried to coax me out for an evening, but I (fortunately) said &#8216;no&#8217;. I&#8217;m not even sure if I heard Chris leave. Somewhere between Chris leaving and the alarm going off the next morning, I&#8217;d managed to haul myself to bed.<br />
I awoke early to get in some work at the office before Easter brunch with Stuart, Therese, and Jordon (one of our co-workers and friends) at &#8220;The Ranche&#8221;, a restaurant in Fish Creek Park in the south of Calgary. It used to be a ranch house back in the day, but is now the home of a mid-upscale eatery. A very filling (and tasty) repast, but a little too long in length.<br />
As we were heading back, my mom called. I had hoped to spend some more time with her before she had to go to the airport, but there were simply not enough hours in the day. Her phone call reminded me that the clock doesn&#8217;t stop. I broke just about every speed limit dropping Chris and Jordon off at Chinook Centre and then hauling myself up to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house. Not even five minutes after arriving, I was taking my mom to the airport.<br />
Despite her protests, I saw her to the gate. I had seen my mother for a collective 8-10 hours over the course of four days, but had only really visited with her for a small fraction of that. I wanted what little time there was left to see her before she left. Before I knew it, she was passing through security. Three entire days vanished before my eyes.<br />
Returning to the office, I tried to finish off the last of the known work. There were still issues to be solved, but we were having problems with the back-end code, and couldn&#8217;t find the developers to fix it. I continued at the problems until Greg called.<br />
Greg had been in town since late Friday. He had called me on the Saturday, but I had simply not the time to call him back. At 7pm Sunday night, I got together with Greg for a couple of short hours. A few beers, a few conversations and debates over my choice of Academy Award winners (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and a short walk around town, I returned Greg to his aunt&#8217;s, arriving home at 11:15pm.<br />
Yesterday was a blur. Too many things to do, not enough time. Same with today, which is why I only noticed 30 minutes ago that it was my father&#8217;s birthday, and I&#8217;d forgotten it. So again, sorry Dad &#8212; I didn&#8217;t mean to forget.<br />
But at least Easter&#8217;s over. Maybe now I can get some rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p><em>Blepharospasm (n.)</em>:<br />
The repetitive contraction of eyelid muscles in a rhythmic fashion. In some instances, the eyelid may repeatedly close or attempt to close. The most common causes of muscle twitching in the eyelid are fatigue or stress.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how I managed to notice that I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass for a year and a day. Well, not so much the blepharospasm as it was the stress that keeping bringing it back.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been here a year. I&#8217;ll forego with torturing you with the recap (you can stop cheering now), but suffice to say it&#8217;s been quite the year. Made a lot of new friends, and missed a lot of old ones. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of the rise of Critical Mass &#8230; and I&#8217;m really hoping that I never need to experience the fall. With luck, our management will keep us in check and we&#8217;ll just keep on sailing.<br />
Hmm. I guess &#8220;surfing&#8221; would be a more appropriate word.<br />
So back that that stress and fatigue thing&#8230; This was something I really hoped to avoid this year, but that was one New Year&#8217;s resolution that got shot down in short order. Too much dedication to my job, I guess. Either that or obsession. Not sure which. (Some argue one way, some the other.)<br />
Been working like a dog again (woof, woof). (Has anyone actually seen a dog work? All the ones I ever saw just laid around all day. What I wouldn&#8217;t give to be a dog for a couple days right now.) I keep forgetting that the more senior you get, the more work seems to migrate in your direction. And while I try to pawn as much of it off to others as I can, there are a handful of projects that (for now) only I can do. Blech.<br />
I just hope this doesn&#8217;t get any worse. People get insomnia from this kind of thing. I don&#8217;t get enough sleep as it is without being able to catch a few Zs. Next thing you know, I&#8217;ll be fighting myself in parking lots, being two people, and planning to blow up credit card companies.<br />
But I&#8217;m not my freaking khakis just yet&#8230;</p>

		<p>Who&#8217;d ever have thought that I would one day become the centre of attention?<br />
Okay, be invited to come near the centre of attention&#8230;<br />
Alright! Be allowed to look towards the centre of attention from a far away, but otherwise intrusive distance. Ya happy now?<br />
Sheesh&#8230;<br />
I can&#8217;t remember when I&#8217;ve had a less productive weekend, except when I was either on vacation or was entertaining visitors. But there were no such distractions this weekend. Instead, we were flitting around like we were &#8230; *gasp* &#8230; popular.<br />
It all started Friday afternoon, at just after 5:00pm. A large portion of the company, exact number unknown, all headed down to the Drum &amp; Monkey pub to wish our now former co-worker (but still friend) Ben. Ben&#8217;s off to slightly greener pastures in Edmonton. Ben was a very visible person around here, and a lot of people (myself grudgingly included) will miss him a lot.<br />
So, yeah, we all got drunk.<br />
Ben has a few interesting friends, who also attended the little affair. One of them was the host of A Channel&#8217;s morning show. (A Channel is our local CityTV-owned independent rabble-rousing station.) Ben used to work at A Channel, and had invited them along. I attempted to introduce myself to him. Unfortunately, not only could I not place him to save my life, I was &#8230; um &#8230; slightly incapacitated. It went something like this:<br />
Him: Hi, you&#8217;re some of Ben&#8217;s co-workers, right?<br />
Us: It shows that badly, eh?<br />
(He starts to go around the table, introducing himself, starting with me.)<br />
Me: (A little louder than I normally talk, and slightly slurred.) Hi, I&#8217;m Geoff. This is gonna sound really stupid, but have we met somewhere before?<br />
(I kid you not, that is the first time I&#8217;ve ever used that line. I just wish, in retrospect, I&#8217;d used it to talk to an attractive woman, instead of some guy who&#8217;s name I still can&#8217;t remember.)<br />
Him: (Not missing a beat) Yeah, I used to buy all that LSD from you out behind the Cecil!<br />
Me: (Surprisingly also not missing a beat &#8212; yeah, I know, it&#8217;s rare, but it does happen) No, I sold heroin. I don&#8217;t deal with that wimpy sh*t.<br />
Him: Yeah yeah yeah! I remember now &#8212; sorry, I was usually too stoned to notice.<br />
Me: Not a problem, you get used to it in my line of work.<br />
For the record, I have never dealt any form of drug (illicit, or otherwise), nor have I sampled anything but alcohol.<br />
I hopped tables most of the night, wandering from conversation to conversation (participating for a while in a semi-strategic discussion with George (one of our account managers), and the guy from A Channel &#8212; he must think I&#8217;m a total freak by now), meeting new people (most of whom I&#8217;ve now forgotten), and generally causing trouble. But hey, what else are you gonna do when you&#8217;re out getting drunk?<br />
We all started departing around 10:45 or so (I really don&#8217;t know what time it was, I&#8217;m just taking estimates from when I first saw the clock when I finally got home). A small number of us were heading over to a place called Calypso&#8217;s, which is one of the white trash bars in Calgary. Luckily positioned right next door to our apartment building. Why there? Easy: Karaoke.<br />
No, I didn&#8217;t sing. Aside from the fact that I can&#8217;t (and have a serious case of stage fright), I was also crashing fast. Even with a caffeinated beverage to attempt to offset the sleepiness, I was at home shortly after 11:30. Chris, on the other hand, was ready for Phase II of the evening (he had left the Drum &amp; Monkey a little earlier) &#8212; he was going to meet with the people at Calypso&#8217;s.<br />
The following day was marked with me at work. (There&#8217;s a surprise.) But only for three hours. Then it was back home to prepare for the evening &#8212; we had a birthday to go to. But first, we decided to go see a movie (Spy Kids &#8212; yeah, it&#8217;s a kid&#8217;s movie, but it&#8217;s a good, funny kids movie) with our friend (and co-worker) Tamara.<br />
After the movie, Chris and I walked over to Kensington for Chrissie&#8217;s birthday. Chrissie is one of our Project Managers, and though we really don&#8217;t know her that well, we thought it would be fun. But first, it was over to Safeway. Just as we reached the bridge to cross the Bow River, I suddenly realized that we had no gift to bring [insert bad &#8220;Little Drummer Boy&#8221; joke here]. So did Chris, only he had a good idea &#8212; flowers. So instead of going directly to Bass Brothers (the pub where Chrissie&#8217;s birthday celebration was in full swing), we stopped by Safeway to pick up some white roses.<br />
The roses were &#8230; well, Chrissie told us that she was going to make a lot of phone calls today and brag. I&#8217;ll let you pick your own description as to how happy/overjoyed/ecstatic she was. Either way, it scored major brownie points for Chris and I &#8230; now we just gotta use &#8217;em while they&#8217;re still good.<br />
We hung out at the pub for about two hours or so, before deciding to keep on going. You see, for perhaps the first time in my life (I&#8217;m not sure about Chris), we actually had multiple invitations (okay, two), and we didn&#8217;t want to disappoint.<br />
Arif, our other inviter, had said that the second soiree of the night wouldn&#8217;t get moving until midnight. Chris and I took the opportunity to get something to eat at Pongo&#8217;s first, before braving the wilds of a party where we knew two people.<br />
We arrived at Arif&#8217;s friend Kim&#8217;s house around 1:30 or so. (Yes, in the morning.) It was packed with strange people. So naturally, we fit right in. We mingled as best we could, but it wouldn&#8217;t be until later in the evening that I found I was able to mingle without being near Chris (unlike my friend, I find a bit of libation takes the edge of my awkwardness).<br />
We arrived home just before 5:00am. (Technically 4:00am, but there was that goofy time change. I wish we&#8217;d just get rid of that.) I promptly passed out.<br />
My alarm went off at 10:30. I was so not ready for it. But it was a dim sum morning, and there are some things that are worth getting up for. We met Jordon (yet another co-worker and friend), and Stuart and Therese at Silver Dragon, where we promptly disposed of a dangerously high stock of delicious bite-sized Chinese edibles. This, for us, is almost a ritual now. But it&#8217;s one, that unless I&#8217;m mistaken, is beginning to become too routine. It&#8217;s almost to the point where I &#8230; and I shudder to say this &#8230; don&#8217;t want to have it every Sunday. I actually think I&#8217;ve had it too much.<br />
Following dim sum, the four of them went off for their afternoon (Therese to work, and the other three to no good) and I went off to the Calgary Hitmen hockey game.<br />
This was the sixth (and potentially deciding) game in the series. You could certainly tell that there were a lot of very avidly interested people (9,022 in all, according to attendance figures) going &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t miss the cars and pedestrians. No-one cared that there&#8217;s been a transit strike here for about a month &#8212; they still showed up in droves. The Saddledome wasn&#8217;t packed &#8212; but considering it&#8217;s minor league hockey, it was a solid turnout.<br />
Before I continue, a couple of corrections. Some of the Observer&#8217;s Log&#8217;s avid readers caught me on my knowledge of hockey. I would like to state, for the records, that I know sqwat about sports. I went to the first game because it sounded like fun. I went to the second game because the first one *was* fun.<br />
First off, the Hitmen and the Pats play in the Western Hockey League, not the World Hockey League, as I had originally assumed. My bad. As for the Pats, their name has a long history. To save myself a heap of typing, I&#8217;ll just take Joel&#8217;s explanation:<br />
The Regina Pats Hockey Club is the oldest major junior hockey franchise in existence, first stepping on the ice in 1917. Over the past 82 years, there have been several stories as to how the team got its name, but the truth is the name came from both Princess Patricia, granddaughter of Queen Victoria (this is also where the Princess Patricia&#8217;s Canadian Light Infantry Regiment, organized at the outbreak of World War I, got its name). A top-level junior hockey team began play in Regina in 1917, and went by the name &#8220;Patricias&#8221; until 1923, when it was shortened to &#8220;Pats&#8221;. The hockey club won the Memorial Cup for junior hockey supremacy in 1925 under the guidance of the legendary Al Ritchie.<br />
So there you go, and now you know. Joel also added that he&#8217;s also not a hockey fan, but had been to Pats games. His reasoning being: &#8220;What else is there to do growing up on the Prairies?&#8221;<br />
I think that explains the crowd in the Saddledome. The noise was booming even before the game started. But once it did, it became a madhouse. The Hitmen literally exploded in the first 15 minutes of the game, and the Pats looked like there were trying to fight off an angry pack of rottweilers. (I can only assume this was partly due to the cheap shot one of the Pats had made at the end of the last Calgary game, and because the Hitmen really wanted to wrap this series up.) The first period ended in a 1-1 tie.<br />
The audience was revved. Toronto Blue Jays fans are quiet folk. Calgary Hitmen fans are not &#8212; you should hear 9,000 people in the Saddledome cheering on minor league hockey. It&#8217;s unreal. Not to mention deafening.<br />
Like the previous game, the breaks between plays were interspersed with contests and prize giveaways (I can only assume to entice people to come out &#8212; it&#8217;s otherwise distracting from the game). During the first intermission, they had even more entertainment &#8212; former WWF wrestler Brett &#8220;The Hitman&#8221; Hart against a pack of angry 10-year-old midget hockey players. They had to flip him on his back, for some goofy reason.<br />
Hockey&#8217;s a strange sport.<br />
The second period could only be described as an utter disaster. The Hitmen had more or less fallen apart. Although they got another goal, the Pats got two. And the Pats were the ones in control. They were swarming. They were passing. They were making the Hitmen really angry, and the Hitmen were responding &#8230; with penalties. A lot of &#8217;em. That&#8217;s how the Pats pulled ahead.<br />
It affected the crowd, too. They started to get quieter. Even when one of the Hitmen managed to get the puck and skate towards the Pats&#8217; goal, the now-normal rise in cheering was more subdued. The energy was gone.<br />
Something happened during the second intermission in the Hitmen&#8217;s locker room. I don&#8217;t know what the coach said, or what performance-enhancing drugs they took, but the Hitmen were breathing fire when they came back out on the ice. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen as good hockey played &#8230; ever. The first 13 minutes of the third period were really good &#8212; the crowd noticed too. But the energy in the crowd&#8217;s cheering didn&#8217;t come back.<br />
Not until Brendl scored a the tying goal at 13:15 in the period. No-one was sitting down. You could barely hear the announcer. Now the crowd got loud.<br />
The chanting was deafening. I actually felt a little sorry for the Pats. You could see the Hitmen actually playing better the louder the crowd got. All you could hear was &#8220;Go Hitmen, Go!&#8221; and rhythmic thumping through the stands. People were cheering, crying, roaring &#8230; and going hoarse very quickly.<br />
The game intensified &#8212; playoff Olympic hockey isn&#8217;t this good. The puck changed ends constantly. The Hitmen wanted to win the game to finish the series. The Pats wanted to win to stay alive. Both wanted the game, bad.<br />
With less than a minute left, I was really to call for overtime. But I didn&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t know why. It&#8217;s probably a good thing, too. With less than 15 seconds left in the game, Brendl swooped down the ice, swerved around the Pats&#8217; defenders, and scooped the puck in the net.<br />
I, like every other capable person in the Saddledome, flew out of my seat. Not only did I nearly wrench my right arm out of its socket (still not sure how I did that), but I could feel my vocal chords tearing apart from my unearthly screaming. My ears were ringing. You couldn&#8217;t hear anything &#8212; not even the overly-loud high-bass music. All you could hear were the blood-curdling screams and ear-piercing whistles of 9,000 crazed fans.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you weren&#8217;t already deaf.<br />
No-one sat down for the last 15 seconds of the game. The Hitmen just let the clock run out. The cheering barely stopped during that time, and only increased when the game was officially over. Now we&#8217;re aiming for tickets for when they come back in the next round of playoffs (not sure if it&#8217;s semi-finals or finals).<br />
And now I&#8217;m back at work, but only to catch up on email. Soon, I&#8217;ll head home to finish of my weekend with the most exciting thing yet.<br />
Laundry.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, I saw my first hockey game in about 20 years. When you&#8217;re able to count the last time you did something in decades, you know you&#8217;re getting old.<br />
The last time I saw a hockey game, I was about seven years old (I&#8217;m taking a guess at this, because I honestly don&#8217;t remember). It was between the Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks (as far as I can remember). I don&#8217;t remember who won, nor do I really remember the game. All I do remember is sitting on the east side of the rink, and remarking that unlike Maple Grove Arena, the seats weren&#8217;t freezing.<br />
Tonight, I saw Calgary&#8217;s WHL (Western Hockey League, for those of you who don&#8217;t recognize the acronym) team &#8212; the Hitmen &#8212; in a playoff game against the Regina Pats.<br />
