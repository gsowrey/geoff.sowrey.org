	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our long weekend started Thursday night, when Allison&#8217;s company decided to hold an employee appreciation event at Metropolis (an entertainment-centric mall a couple of blocks from our apartment). Interlogic was springing for two hours of video games at Sega Playdium, and then dinner at the Rainforest Cafe.<br />
We didn&#8217;t find out about these plans until Wednesday night, so I was unable to make the video games (already having made plans to the &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; with some of my co-workers). However, I made an effort to drop by for dinner.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d met Allison&#8217;s new co-workers, and most of them seemed very nice. Claire, in particular, was extremely cordial &#8212; but since she&#8217;s the HR manager, I guess that&#8217;s to be expected.<br />
When we returned home, we made our final decision to go to Victoria for the weekend. We had tentative plans for some time, but we based our final decision to go on the fact that Allison&#8217;s grandmother was in the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria. Her grandmother had been the focal point of the Collins/Vailmont Easter for about 30 years, and it just seemed wrong not to come over and cheer her up.<br />
(As you may recall, we were in Nanaimo last Easter, engaged in Easter egg hunts in the grandparent&#8217;s yard. This would be the first year in about three decades where the hunt would not happen.)<br />
Early Friday morning, we hauled ourselves out of bed, and hit the road to Tsawwassen. Because of the Easter weekend, BC Ferries were running trips every hour, instead of every two hours, which was the norm. This was good for us, since we didn&#8217;t need to worry about missing a sailing &#8230; which we did.<br />
Arriving about ten minutes too late to make the 10:00 sailing, we parked the car and opted for a late breakfast &#8212; pizza. But this was no ordinary pizza, it was *breakfast* pizza: Eggs, onions, ham, green peppers, cheese, but no tomato sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, and fairly expensive. If they made announcements, it would go something like this:<br />
&#8220;Your attention, please. BC Ferries is happy to charge you exceedingly high prices for low-quality food that you will buy because you are hungry from trying to get here on time not to miss a sailing, or your children are begging you into submission&#8230;&#8221;<br />
We made the 11:00 sailing with no trouble.<br />
We sailed across on the Spirit of British Columbia, the largest short-distance ferry in the fleet (another larger ferry carts passengers up the coast, which is an overnight trip). It&#8217;s a massive vessel, about the size of a small cruise ship. It makes the trip fairly enjoyable &#8230; at least if you don&#8217;t suffer from motion sickness.<br />
Procuring a seat in the corner of the cafeteria, I ran cover by buying some snack food while Allison worked. BC Ferries doesn&#8217;t take kindly to people sucking up table space, so I made an effort to make them think we were eating &#8230; just really really slowly.<br />
Arriving in Victoria, we found it was raining. We had hoped that the weather would be nice for a change, but the generally poor weather was following us around. And no, before you think it, one does not get used to continually bad weather; one gets increasingly irritable.<br />
After a short drive into Victoria, we headed over to the Royal Jubilee Hospital to check in with the family elders. After parking, we wandered inside, and attempted to find Allison&#8217;s parents. We knew they were there &#8212; Allison&#8217;s Aunt Robin drives a very recognisable car.<br />
Luckily for us, we ran into Robin on the second floor, while attempting to find the washroom. Allison&#8217;s grandmother was pleased to see us, as were her parents. We visited briefly as a pair, then ducked into the TV room.<br />
We stayed at the hospital until around 6:00 or so, at which time we headed over to Robin&#8217;s apartment for dinner.<br />
We slept on the floor that night, a probably-not-so-great idea. I woke with a stiffness bordering on rigor mortis, Allison not better off. But we grinned and bore it, and had a leisurely breakfast with Robin, Allison&#8217;s parents, and her grandfather.<br />
The morning was significantly brighter than the previous day, the sun having actually shone through for a change. After a quick visit to the hospital, we opted for a tour of Victoria. Okay, maybe not *really* a tour &#8212; we had been there before, after all &#8212; but it was a good excuse to go out.<br />
We drove downtown, parking on a side street near the Eaton Centre. We had only an hour (the parking meter went no further) to wander about. So we wandered &#8230; right into Roger&#8217;s Chocolates.<br />
Roger&#8217;s is a mainstay in parts of BC &#8212; it&#8217;s an old company, specialising in some very tasty treats. It&#8217;s like Laura Secord back east &#8230; only better. Our mission was to obtain Easter chocolates for the family &#8212; this was not going to be a typical Easter, so we thought it better that we make an effort to do something special.<br />
After our romp through the chocolate shop, we walked around the harbour area, wandering into The Empress hotel. We checked out the prices of the lunch menus, suffered sticker shock, and proceeded back outside again.<br />
After moving the car to a less time-dependent location (a very cheap parking garage), we hopped out to find some lunch. We headed into an Indian restaurant, and promptly started inquring about the soup of the day. That&#8217;s when we found out that there was no lunch special on weekends, which meant the prices more than doubled. We made a hasty exit and went into another Indian restaurant two doors down.<br />
Being a beautiful day, we spent a fair bit of time wandering along the walkway around the inner harbour. You could hear the mainstay bagpiper from across the harbour with no difficulty.<br />
Walking around towards the parliment buildings, we passed a congregation of people, surrounding a small brass band, and a boat covered with flowers. Our first impression was that someone was being married. It wasn&#8217;t until a while later that it occurred to us that it was actually a memorial service.<br />
The walkways were packed with people, all relishing in the bright sunshine. (It was so bright that I nearly got a sunburn!) But the temperature was still cool, so only the brave (or the stupid) wore shorts. And yes, I did have a pair with me &#8212; it was still too cool for my liking.<br />
Buskers were about, too. We saw one busker whose act we remembered from the year before. There were a few differences, which made the overall show pretty good, certainly worth the two dollars Allison gave the busker.<br />
On the way back to the car, we checked for the availability of a hotel &#8212; we weren&#8217;t too keen on staying on the floor for a second night. We found one hotel room left for $30, and promptly headed off before we lost it.<br />
The Friendship Inn has been in Victoria since the dawn of time, or sometime roughly near it. The buildings are old, the rooms musty, and the mattresses somewhat curved. But for $30, I wasn&#8217;t about to complain any. Well, maybe except for the people &#8220;living&#8221; next door. We didn&#8217;t leave our things, opting to bring them back with us.<br />
If you go just west of Victoria, you&#8217;ll run into Esquimalt. Dependng on who you ask, Esquimalt is either a scary, run-down, naval base-influenced town; or it&#8217;s a fairly nice little suburb. I personally vote for the latter. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; there are some seedy areas (but then, even Oakville has its seedy areas).<br />
We drove about, looking at the houses, even looking into an open house out of curiousity, just to see what was about. We drove up and down, back and forth, eventually finding ourselves back in Victoria again.<br />
So we drove up and down, back and forth, until we found ourselves driving along Dallas Road, heading into Oak Bay. We had driven along this route before the previous year, only it was Allison driving, and it was at night. It pretty much ended the same way, with us passing along the north side of UVic trying to find our way back into Victoria.<br />
We returned to the hospital towards dinnertime, to check on everyone milling around Allison&#8217;s grandmother. We were surprised to find Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister) in attendence, and we had to do a double take when we saw Brenna and Cameron (Allison&#8217;s cousins, who live in Parksville). They were on their way back to Nanaimo (and Parksville). We nearly passed each other in the hall.<br />
Dinner was at Robin&#8217;s again, only instead of the home-cooked meal we ate the night before, we had Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
As a child, I remember loving Kentucky Fried Chicken. Of course, as a child, I could eat whatever I wanted without any consequences. As an adult, I am convinced that KFC is evidence of Satan&#8217;s existence. Allison and I both regretted dinner&#8230;<br />
On the way back to our hotel that night, I noticed something a little strange &#8212; the car seemed to be a bit louder. In fact, it vibrated a bit more, too. In the back of my mind, I knew what the problem was. In the front of my mind, I was denying it with every ounce of my strength.<br />
The next morning, the truth finally decided it would not be contained. On the way out to have something to eat, the muffler broke loose. Well, partially loose &#8212; there was a large rubber bracket holding the muffer to the car. As Allison&#8217;s mother would point out later, every time my car and the island have anything to do with one another, I have problems with the car.<br />
Pulling off to the side, I whipped out my trusty bungee cord, and lashed the stupid muffler to the underside of the car. Ideally, I would&#8217;ve just taken the muffler off, but that rubber connector just taunted me.<br />
We headed back to Vancouver in early afternoon, realising that if we hurried, we could get to Granville Island before it closed. (It was this revelation that made Allison convinced that she couldn&#8217;t live anywhere outside of Vancouver &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t get to the Market whenever she wanted.)<br />
A good weekend. It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had a good weekend. I mean a weekend where we didn&#8217;t have to worry about being rained on. Believe me &#8212; that&#8217;s a long time.<br />
After a leisurely rising Saturday morning, I went out to get my muffler fixed. That was my first mistake &#8212; I found out that the entire exhaust system was about two minutes from giving out. $200 later, I was out getting my car washed. That was my second mistake &#8212; Allison wanted me home earlier than that to clean. As soon as I got in, we were running back out again.<br />
We were going to spend the afternoon at Granville Island (yes, we go there a lot) looking around the market and buying food for dinner. It was a good way to spend the afternoon.<br />
Sunday started off even more beautifully than Saturday. It was warm (we opened all the windows for the first time this year) and sunny &#8212; the day was just waiting to be enjoyed. So we spent an hour cleaning. Don&#8217;t laugh &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how good that made us feel.<br />
As we were working, Allison heard a news story on the TV, talking about how the Alberta Report (a group of ultra right-wing wackos from Alberta &#8212; although there are those who think that *anyone* from Alberta is an ultra right-wing wacko) was going to take their message to Toronto, which the Report viewed as where most of the evils in Canada came from.<br />
It was then that it suddenly hit me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t view Toronto (or Oakville, for that matter) as home. In fact, it seemed somewhat foreign to me. It was no longer a place that was comforting, familiar &#8212; it was very distant, cold, disparate from everything I could think of.<br />
It was with a great and sudden shock that I realised that I have become a BCer: I complain about the rain and the cold (despite the fact that it&#8217;s not that cold), I wear sandals as often as possible (I&#8217;m wearing them right now), I can&#8217;t stand the NDP government (but will probably vote for them because all the alternatives are far worse), and view the east as an entirely different place. Canada is certainly different when you&#8217;re not in the centre of the universe anymore&#8230;<br />
At any rate, after our quick spring clean, we jumped in the car, and ran out to enjoy the day. We ended the day with a quick pasta dish, which for some unknown reason, made the whole weekend complete.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend was a little strange &#8212; we received some very unusual weather.<br />
It all started Friday night. As we were walking around English Bay with our friend Tyler, returning from a wonderful Greek dinner, we noticed that the sky was dark &#8212; much darker than we were used to. As we gazed up into the sky, we noticed that not only was it dark, but the soft texture seemed to have disappeared. It was now just a stark blackness, save for tens of millions of tiny, shimmering specks. At first, we didn&#8217;t know what to make of it &#8212; had something gone wrong with the clouds? Why were they so black?<br />
Then came the uncomfortable truth &#8230; our comforting blanket of cloud-cover was gone. The bleakness of space could be seen &#8212; our protection from UFOs was nowhere to be found.<br />
We quickly ran indoors to protect ourselves from the open night.<br />
The following morning, we rose slowly, allowing ourselves to bask in the joy of the weekend dawn. Yet again, we were disturbed by a change in the norm &#8212; one of us had left the light on all night.<br />
As I fumbled about, trying to find out which light was still on, I had a sudden attack of fear &#8212; none of the lights were on; the mysterious light was coming from outside. With a shaking hand, I slowly parted the window, only to have my eye seared by a powerful light from the sky.<br />
I darted back into the room, jumping back into the safety of my bed, and pulling the pillow overtop of my face, resisting the urge to break into tears. I was terrified &#8212; the sky had caught fire, and we were all going to die.<br />
Allison asked me what was wrong, why was I shaking with terror? I told her about our imminent doom. She took it surprisingly well. She got out of bed, and peered out the window. I expected to hear a shriek that would wake the dead. Instead, my ears only met with a sigh. For a moment, I thought it was the sound of her last breath, having peered into the face of Death.<br />
But no &#8212; she breathed further! In fact, she threw the curtains open, allowing more of that curséd light to pour into the room, filling every crack, and even passing through the comfort of my pillow. A moment later, my comfort was ripped away as my love flung the sheets from the bed, exposing my poor body to that harsh brightness.<br />
&#8220;Why?&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;Why do you torture me so?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Because it is the dawn, and the spring is upon us!&#8221; she harkened, throwing open the window to the day.<br />
The room filled with an eerie warmth, which reminded me vaguely of springtime in Ontario. But no &#8212; it could not be &#8212; the sun did not shine in Vancouver, it was not meant to happen!<br />
But as I rose, holding my hands over my eyes, I could see that I was wrong &#8212; the sun had bled through the ever-thinning clouds. The sun, giver of life, and burner of skin. It had not given up on our poor, soggy souls! The sun was out, the birds were singing, it was a completely beautiful day!<br />
So we decided to go see a movie.<br />
(Hey, how much sun do you think we can take after four months of rain?)<br />
All kidding (and over-done prose) aside, it was a very unusual weekend. The sun was out, and a lot of the cold and wetness that has plagued us here for the past four months (at least temporarily) went away. Taking advantage of a nice day, we did opt to go see a movie.<br />
It was &#8220;Babe: Pig In The City&#8221;. I highly recommend it, along with it&#8217;s predecessor, &#8220;Babe&#8221;. Very good movies. The movie cost $1, which was the only real reason we went.<br />
To get there, we had a nice, long drive into Coquitlam. It was a beautiful day, with blue sky, white-capped mountains, and surprisingly little traffic (at least until we got to Coquitlam).<br />
The following day, we decided to do something even bolder &#8212; we went biking. Unfortunately, Sunday&#8217;s weather wasn&#8217;t quite as nice. It was a little cloudier, and a little cooler, but it was still much better than normal. Although I&#8217;m hesitant to say it, things are beginning to look a lot less like Christmas, and a lot more like Canada Day.<br />
Now if we can just do something about Eastern Canada&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s only so much rain you can take before you start to go a little strange in the head. It has rained here nearly every single day since 1 Nov 1998. We&#8217;ve had about 10-15 days in that stretch where it didn&#8217;t rain, and about five days where we actually saw that big bright yellow circle in the sky. And Heaven forbid we should think that the colour of sky is anything but grey!<br />
Thus, I need not explain why Allison and I wanted to see something different for a change.<br />
So we went to Seattle.<br />
Why Seattle? Simple &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t been there before. It would be a change of pace, and (hopefully) something out of the ordinary. After all, you can only stare at the 33 walls of your apartment for so long&#8230;<br />
We piled into the car bright and early Saturday morning, maps in hand, and headed for the border (with a brief pit stop at McDonald&#8217;s to ease the rumblings in our stomachs). The traffic at the border was a bit heavy, but neither of us were too upset. It took only a few minutes to traverse the border, convince the US Border Patrol we were harmless, and be on our way.<br />
The trip to Seattle is about three hours, depending on how bad the traffic in Seattle is. (And even on a weekend, it&#8217;s pretty bad.) The trip&#8217;s a little dull too &#8212; the terrain is pretty flat. The rain and fog obscured all the interesting things to look at, so we had to entertain ourselves in conversation.<br />
I regularly find it amazing that despite all the time Allison and I spend together, we can always find new things to talk about.<br />
When we arrived in Seattle, we arrived in Seattle traffic. I hadn&#8217;t seen traffic that heavy since I lived in Oakville and drove into Toronto. And this was a weekend! Rush hour must be a complete nightmare.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we spotted the Space Needle, and went about figuring out how to get off the I-5, and into the city. Luckily, Americans are fairly good at marking signs. We exited the I-5, and found our way to Mercer Drive. This cuts a somewhat quasi-diagonal path through the north-eastern end of town, taking you by the Expo &#8217;62 site (complete with that so-called &#8220;tower&#8221;, the Space Needle), and eventually putting you near the waterfront. Arriving on Elliott Street, we turned left and proceeded to attempt to find parking.<br />
Folks, if you decide to drive to Seattle, make sure you have small American bills when you arrive downtown. Parking there is expensive (often brutally so), and unless you have small American bills, you might find it very difficult to find a place to park. A lot of the lots require you to place a rolled up bill into a slot. Other take the bills and issue a ticket (and have major problems with CIBC VISA cards).<br />
After nearly an hour of trying, we eventually found a lot where we could park for US$8. We weren&#8217;t exactly ecstatic about the price, but we didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The immediate agenda after that was to find lunch.<br />
By the time we finished eating at a cheap (albeit not only in price, but also in quality) Chinese restaurant, we decided it was time to actually go see *something*. So we walked up a street, turned a few corners, and arrived at Pike&#8217;s Place Market. Or rather, the staircase going up.<br />
Seattle is quite hilly. It&#8217;s not as hilly as San Francisco, but it&#8217;s much hillier than Vancouver. There are several staircases running from the waterfront to the top of the hill. (I would learn later that there was a reason for all that.)<br />
Once we reached the top (a little winded from all the climbing), we headed into the market. Pike&#8217;s Place Market (also known as the &#8220;Public Market&#8221; if you see the huge neon signs) has been there for quite a long time. It has just about every imaginable shop, selling fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers (fresh and dried), home-made chilli, doughnuts, flying fish, stained glass &#8230;<br />
Flying fish? Oh yes, there are flying fish in Pike&#8217;s Place.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s a store called Pike Place Fish, and they have a rather interesting method of getting the fish from the ice-packed display to the packers behind the counter.<br />
They throw them.<br />
I kid you not. You&#8217;ll suddenly hear a loud: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; from a large guy dressed in orange hip waders, quickly followed by a chorus of people behind the counter, all shouting: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; (they do this for every order, fish or otherwise), followed by a real large chinook salmon, flying through the air, from the large guy dressed in orange hip waders to another person behind the counter.<br />
Needless to say, this attracts a lot of spectators, most of whom want to see the flying fish. Apparently, sales are more brisk during the summer. (Tourists are such gullible people.) You can check them out on the Internet, at <a href="http://www.fishthrowers.com/">http://www.fishthrowers.com</a>.<br />
After viewing the sailing salmon, we continued our way down the length of the market to see what objets d&#8217;art were available. Most of it was produce, which is not at all a bad thing &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing like smelling fresh vegetables and fruits and flowers.<br />
Towards the end of the market, we came across a table where a man was selling home-made stained glass kaleidoscopes. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have stopped were it not for the fact that a neighbour of my family in Oakville makes almost the same thing. The design of the simpler kaleidoscopes was almost exactly the same, and the more complicated ones were very similar. (My family&#8217;s neighbour is one up on this man, though &#8212; he makes a binocular kaleidoscope that is just a wonder to see.)<br />
I made some quick inquiries. The cheap triangular scopes were about US$30. The more complicated ones with dials and spinning vials of beaded glass were about US$50, and the really nice pieces were US$120 and up. My family&#8217;s neighbour could probably make a killing&#8230;<br />
Reaching the end of the market, we hopped across the street and entered the Mecca of the West Coast &#8212; the original Starbucks Coffee Shop. Founded in 1971, it&#8217;s served countless cups of caffeine to the masses, and marketed itself into world dominance.<br />
They screwed up our cups of hot chocolate. They forgot the whipped cream.<br />
After walking around a little and snapping a few pictures, Allison went to purchase a dried garlic and flower wreath for hanging on our kitchen wall. (We needed a little more decoration in there.) Not wanting to carry the fragile decoration with us for the rest of the day, I quickly ran it back to the car.<br />
Upon returning to Allison, we headed down 1st Street to Pioneer Square, the original centre of Seattle, and the location of Doc Maynard&#8217;s. We were in search of the Seattle Underground Tour.<br />
What&#8217;s underground Seattle? Rocks, mud, a few bodies, but mostly dirt. All except for a 22-block area in Pioneer Square, what was originally Seattle.<br />
As we would learn over the course of the tour, Seattle used to be built on mudflats. No problem with that, except that twice daily your house flooded. It got worse when they installed Crappers (toilets as they were known in the 1890s) &#8212; twice daily, toilets on the flats would explode, creating six-foot high geysers from the &#8216;loo. Not exactly the sort of thing you want.<br />
To solve a large number of problems, the citizens did the only thing they could &#8212; they burnt the city to the ground. Okay, they didn&#8217;t actually do that on purpose, it kind of happened when a glue jar caught fire. It fell onto a turpentine-soaked floor. Of a shop built mostly of wood. The next door neighbour was a warehouse &#8230; filled with whiskey. I think you get the idea&#8230;<br />
The first ordinance passed required that all buildings be made from 60% non-flammable materials. Luckily for the town, the mayor owned the local brick works.<br />
One of the next things they did was plan to raise the roads. Chuckholes (essentially a killer pothole) were becoming so bad, the only way to solve the problem was to literally cover the roads &#8230; with upwards of 32 feet of soil. So they began to solve the problem, by raising all the buildings, then raising the road, then building the sidewalks.<br />
Sound a little weird? Well, that&#8217;s how Seattle got its underground. When the roads were raised, there were huge gaps between the road and the buildings. When those gaps were eventually covered with a sidewalk, the areas underground were abandoned. That was 1907. It wasn&#8217;t until the 1960&#8217;s, when local historian Bill Speidel opened the underground for a tour. Because of his efforts, the Underground (and the surrounding area) is now a protected historical area.<br />
At least, as much as Americans will actually protect that kind of thing &#8230; especially when there&#8217;s a profit to be made by paving over paradise, and putting up a parking lot.<br />
The tour was pretty cool &#8230; the tunnels aren&#8217;t heated. Sorry, cheap joke. We learned a lot about Seattle and its history, not to mention saw a lot of how Seattle was built one hundred years ago. It&#8217;s really fascinating &#8212; I recommend it to anyone going there.<br />
Following the tour, Allison and I went back to retrieve our car. Unlike all the other parking garages with reasonable hours (i.e. they never close), ours shut down at 20:00. Not exactly what I&#8217;d call convenient.<br />
After driving over half the city trying not to listen to Allison telling me the correct way out, we hopped back on the I-5 and headed towards home. We had thought about staying the night, but when you took into account that hotels cost about US$90 a night, we thought of all the other things we could do with that $90, and opted to go home.<br />
The following day, we rose a bit later than usual (we were a little tired from our journey), and started to plan out our day. We thought it might be interesting to go through Lynden, the Dairy Capital of Washington State.<br />
Why? Why not? (Also because we thought that the Tulip Festival might be on, although we couldn&#8217;t find any confirmation of that.)<br />
After looping through Lynden a few times, we came to the conclusion that the town was really boring (nearly everything was closed) and we opted to have a bite to eat, and leave.<br />
One note to travellers to Lynden: Don&#8217;t eat at Bob&#8217;s Burger and Brew (I swear I&#8217;m not making the name up). Just trust me on that.<br />
Just as we began to leave Lynden, the weather started to act strange &#8212; heavy rain, very dark clouds, hail, and thunderstorms. One of the things about BC weather &#8212; it&#8217;s usually pretty tame. This was way out of the ordinary, and it had me a little worried &#8212; it looked like tornado weather. (Although I&#8217;m told we can&#8217;t get tornados here, the weather patterns seemed just ripe for an ol&#8217; Kansas vacuum.)<br />
Returning to Canada again, we headed into Surrey to find an area called Cloverdale. Inside Cloverdale is a subdivision (whose name has totally escaped me) that has Victorian-style homes. This has, apparently, become a popular trend in homes. After a little driving around, we stumbled across the subdivision, and drove in.<br />
Very nice homes, and it really looked like a nice neighbourhood. It&#8217;s the sort of place I&#8217;d like to live. But the original subdivision was all sold about a year or two ago, so we couldn&#8217;t actually check any of the places out.<br />
Luckily, there was a new phase being built just next door. There were two show homes available for viewing. All I can say is &#8212; very impressive. Allison and I were thinking we could skip going to Europe, and we could get jobs in Surrey (well, *I* could get a job in Surrey), and we could buy.<br />
When reality finally sank back in, we acknowledged that while we&#8217;d love to live there, we had too many other things we wanted to do first, and Europe was one of them. It was by far the best designed house we&#8217;d seen to date, and it had a lot of design features that we wanted to include in ours. Maybe one day&#8230;<br />
At any rate, we&#8217;re back to working on our lives. Hopefully, our next big adventure won&#8217;t be far away!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is an auspicious date for me &#8212; one year ago today, I started my new job, working for a company that makes video games. A year later, I&#8217;m still here, despite the difficulties Radical went through in October and the layoffs that followed. Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that things have turned out they way they have.<br />
Speaking of new jobs, Allison has a new job as well. After countless (and some very strange) interviews, she started last Wednesday (10 February 1999) with InterLogic Engineering in Surrey as the Corporate Presence Guru. Okay, that&#8217;s not her *official* title, but I think that would be a good one.<br />
It was on her start day that I really began to hate snow. At least in Vancouver, that is. Well, actually, Vancouver itself isn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; it&#8217;s Burnaby, New Westminster, and Surrey I hate.<br />
Here&#8217;s what happened. It seems our old friend Murphy noticed that Allison was to start a new job, and Heaven forbid that she have an easy time of it. So he made it snow. A lot. We woke up that morning to a few inches of snow. That in itself wouldn&#8217;t be so bad &#8212; except that no-one here knows what to do with it. (And it doesn&#8217;t help that there&#8217;s no-one here who knows how to remove it.)<br />
Allison doesn&#8217;t like driving in the snow here, especially in her car (it&#8217;s a small Toyota). Considering all the morons in SUVs (sports utility vehicles) out here, it&#8217;s not unusual not to want to drive. Being the gentleman that I am (okay, you can all stop snickering now!), I offered to drive her to work.<br />
Normally, the trip is about 30 minutes. We left at about 7:40 so Allison could be at work for 8:30 (that her start time). By 8:00, we were just beginning to inch our way over the bridge into Surrey &#8230; and saw the line of 10,000 cars trying to climb a teeny-tiny little hill. Of course, the hill was covered in a nice sheet of ice.<br />
Realising that we weren&#8217;t going to get anywhere fast, I whipped out my trust map of the Lower Mainland, found a detour, and promptly ended up looking at another hill. Allison had always complained of how &#8220;flat&#8221; Surrey was &#8212; I was, not surprisingly, annoyed when she told me that there were hills in Surrey. The hills never seem to count when it&#8217;s dry and free of snow&#8230;<br />
Anyway, I turned around to go back to the 10,000 car pileup, and accidentally turned down the wrong road. This turned out to be a very fortuitous accident &#8212; it led us up a nice, relatively clear road, and got us around the lineups.<br />
Just after 9:15, we pulled into InterLogic&#8217;s parking lot, and Allison quickly headed inside. It was now my turn to go to work, and there was no way I was going to drive there. I left my car in the parking lot, hopped a taxi, and caught the SkyTrain. An hour later, I pulled into work.<br />
Again, I repeat &#8212; it sucks when it snows here.<br />
On the weekend, we travelled over to the Island to visit with family, most notably for Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s birthday. He turned the fresh young age of 80, and seemed quite happy to see his family all around him.<br />
For the event, we went to The Grotto, a restaurant that was noted for great food. This much was true &#8212; the food was pretty decent. The management, however, was the worst I have ever had the displeasure to experience. They didn&#8217;t seem to understand the concept of &#8220;customer satisfaction&#8221;.<br />
Allison&#8217;s aunt made a reservation at the restaurant a month or so in advance (it was, after all, the day before Valentine&#8217;s). She wanted to make sure that we would have seating for all 14 of us. Funny how they didn&#8217;t have 14 menus set aside&#8230;<br />
That was the first problem. It took 20 minutes to round up 14 menus. But it got worse. It took 30 minutes to get six appetizers. Six. Not 14, six. Something doesn&#8217;t add up there. Letting that slide, we had to wait another 30 minutes for our meals, and even then &#8212; we only got half of them. Moreover, the guest of honour (Grandpa Vailmont) was served last! Even a special order we had placed a day earlier (steamed vegetables for Grandma Vailmont) when unfulfilled. It took another 10 minutes to receive the last of the meals.<br />
Needless to say, there were several of us who were ticked off. Allison and I made a point of talking to the manager. The manager tried to claim that there were &#8220;too busy&#8221;, and deferred to whom we assume is her daughter (or possibly her granddaughter). Neither of them would apologise for the screw-ups, and in fact tried to blame the whole thing on us! How dare we bring so many people to their restaurant!<br />
Ten minutes later, Allison and I walked out with a $40 gift certificate, and a promise that we&#8217;d never go back &#8212; we never even got an apology. We didn&#8217;t want the gift certificate &#8212; we wanted to hear: &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry&#8221;.<br />
At lunch today, I met with my cousins, Pam and Darren. Darren works here in Vancouver, but tends to travel from Peru to the Arctic on a semi-regular basis (ah, the joys of being a globetrotting geologist). Pam works for Petro-Canada in Calgary, but had come out for a visit. We spent a rather long (and very pleasant) lunch at the Yaletown Brewery.<br />
That&#8217;s about all there is from this neck of the woods for now. The rain has stopped, but the winds are still blowing. (Lousy La Nina!) Hopefully spring will start soon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last night, Allison&#8217;s sister Jane returned from Europe (see [[Weekend in Calgary, Banff (Bamf!)]]), having spent the past seven and a half months in England (and Greater Europe). I remember being quite jealous at the time that she was going &#8212; she was doing what I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a few years.<br />
It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not going to be able to do in not too distant a time &#8212; once I&#8217;m married, I can&#8217;t go off for a year on my own. It&#8217;s making me really realise how much I liked being on my own while I was at university. Not having to answer to anyone (except professors, and later, my employers) was pretty handy.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Allison &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t give her up for all the tea in China. Hmm&#8230; bad analogy &#8212; I hate tea (except green tea, I love green tea &#8212; especially after a really nice batch of sushi, with tekka, maki, and maybe California &#8230; I&#8217;m not big on BC rolls yet &#8212; the salmon skin kinda turns me off from them). Oh, I&#8217;ve got a good analogy &#8212; I&#8217;d just as soon dump all my material possessions (i.e. the home theatre, the CDs, and my computers). Those of you who know me (i.e. if you&#8217;re reading this, you should know me, otherwise I don&#8217;t know what you received this) realise what that means, I hope.<br />
Okay, now that I&#8217;ve gone all gushy, time to get back on topic &#8230; whatever it was.<br />
Oh yeah &#8230; Jane returning home. So, Allison and I are standing in the airport, staring at the TV monitor trying to figure out which of the hundreds of people exiting the customs area is in fact her sister. Allison was asking *me*, who had only met her sister at most THREE times before, if it was her. (Of course, this was because I had a better view of the monitor.)<br />
The surprising part was that I did recognise her when she came out. Her white jacket was a bit grungier, her hair was different, and her eyes had the gleam of someone who had seen the world but not slept enough to look quite alert &#8212; but it was Jane, only now it was Jane, World Conqueror.<br />
I felt kinda weird. This was (at most) the fourth time I had seen my future sister-in-law. The last time had been in April of 1998. Since then, Allison and I had grown much closer, moved in with each other, travelled to Calgary, California, New York, and Toronto, gotten engaged, and started to plan a wedding. Jane&#8217;s (and Allison&#8217;s) parents know me quite well (to the point where they talk to me on the phone &#8212; not to be just polite, but they are genuinely interested &#8230; or at least they seem to be), and her brother Randy and I have conversations (albeit brief ones &#8212; Randy doesn&#8217;t really stop moving around for too long).<br />
Poor Jane &#8212; she had a near-total stranger lunge up and hug her as she arrived home.<br />
I made an effort to talk to her, but at the same time, I preferred that Allison do most of the talking &#8230; I figured that a voice Jane was familiar with would be more comforting. I feel like I know Jane fairly well, but that&#8217;s mostly because of Allison and her parents. In reality, I barely know her.<br />
I&#8217;m still finding it strange realising that there&#8217;s another family that I&#8217;m becoming a part of, where they acknowledge me as more than some guy Allison hangs around with. Oh well, I guess these are things I&#8217;m just going to have to get used to as life goes on. And what a life it&#8217;s turning out to be&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I found out this morning that I&#8217;m worth keeping. Needless to say, this is a big boost to not only my esteem, but also my ego.<br />
What&#8217;s all this stemming from? The Radical restructuring. Today will forever be known as &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221; within the walls here at Radical. Today will be an example of why we hate Disney.<br />
A couple of years ago, Radical negotiated a contract with ESPN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Broadcast Corporation, who happens to be owned by Disney. We were making (and were in the process of making) games for ESPN Digital Games &#8212; a venture between us and ESPN. We had three: Hockey, basketball, and a snowboarding game.<br />
A couple of weeks ago, we got the bad news &#8212; Disney said &#8220;no&#8221;. We weren&#8217;t allowed to try a publish them. TRY. It was like talking to Yoda: &#8220;Do or do not, there is no try.&#8221; Someone (dunno who) believed we were incapable. We had been gearing up for publishing for quite a while (which is why we have an office in San Francisco, and are technically an American company, so investors won&#8217;t be spooked). Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we aren&#8217;t doing jack with ESPN anymore.<br />
Unfortunately, ESPN was our major revenue stream. In other words, we&#8217;re screwed. And that&#8217;s what brought us to today. We&#8217;re closing the San Francisco office. We&#8217;ve released our CEO and CFO (much to the delight of everyone here). But we also had to release about 50 people here. That didn&#8217;t go over so well.<br />
We knew this was coming. We&#8217;ve known for a couple of weeks. It&#8217;s like walking on broken glass around here. You feel like there&#8217;s a sniper ready to take you out at a single command. Okay, *I* felt that way. Most of Pure3D is safe &#8212; they&#8217;re pretty bulletproof. Well, almost all of them.<br />
Greg James and Nenad Ukropina weren&#8217;t. I thought I was a goner, for sure. Resume ready to roll at a moment&#8217;s notice. Not that I wanted to leave, but I needed to be ready to bail if the plane started diving.<br />
Pure3D actually had private meetings to plan our escape, should things go really bad. Tim&#8217;s a Big Guy here &#8212; he knows almost everything. But even he sounded worried. (Either that, or he&#8217;s utter brilliant at getting us to think along safety lines.) We worked out a plan of attack &#8212; five of them, actually, Option A through Option E. These various plans went from things going according to plan, to Pure3D leaving as a team and going somewhere else (this was &#8220;Option D&#8221;, a running joke for several weeks before and after &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221;), to casting off to the four winds.<br />
This morning, we were all called to the lounge for a short meeting. It was a short meeting. It went kinda like this:<br />
Management: Good morning. We&#8217;ll keep this short. We have to release about 50 people so that we can keep the company afloat.<br />
Us: (To ourselves) Oh boy&#8230;<br />
Management: When you return to your desks, some of you will have email. If you do, please return here with your personal effects immediately.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: You will have to turn in your keys and anything else that belongs to Radical. You will then be escorted from the building.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: Thank you.<br />
You could have told us this would happen, and we wouldn&#8217;t have believed you. No way in a million years would we have guessed that this was how they were going to deal with the issue. It almost felt like Nazis had replaced our cool management team overnight with a bunch of assholes.<br />
Tim wasn&#8217;t in a good mood. I don&#8217;t blame him. He didn&#8217;t want to do what had to be done, and I know he didn&#8217;t like what had to be done. Radical did the only thing they could &#8212; remove the people before their anger did anything damaging. It was possible, though nothing seems to have happened &#8230; yet. The day&#8217;s long from over.<br />
Lunch will be an interesing one. I&#8217;m certain there will be talk. Mostly about Option D. We have no idea what&#8217;s going on, or what will happen in the coming days, let alone weeks and months. I think I&#8217;d better keep my parachute ready&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;d always thought that the &#8220;Welcome Wagon&#8221; was a euphemism for a group of well-natured people who would come to the door of folks new the the neighbourhood and welcome them into the community. Little did I know that Welcome Wagon is actually the name of a corporation that organises events and earns a profit (or so I assume &#8230; why else would a company have &#8220;Ltd.&#8221; as part of its name?).<br />
Welcome Wagon Ltd. organised a bridal show in Nanaimo on Sunday, and Allison&#8217;s mom thought it would be a good idea if we went over to see the show. Not so much to make arrangements (we&#8217;re still working on an actual date), but to get ideas for the ceremony and for the following reception.<br />
This meant we had to catch the 8:30 ferry from Horseshoe Bay, which meant we had to be up no later than 7:15. I crawled out of bed at 7:13. Allison followed at about 7:16. We were out of the apartment by 7:28, and the car had hit the road by 7:32. We arrived in Horseshoe Bay just after 8:00, where our next little fiasco took place &#8212; finding a place to park. This is the single hardest thing to do there, because parking is at an absolute minimum.<br />
The BC Ferries lot was full, that I expected. However, the nearby Impark yard was also full. I started to worry a little. But Allison knew of a lot over by the Boathouse. It was for Sewall&#8217;s Marina (it allowed no overnight parking as a result), but you could get a spot for the day, which it what we did. After I parked the car, I ran down to the machine to get a ticket. It was one of the older machines, which spat out a ticket at a time (for each $2.50 inserted). Ideally, it would do the same as the other machines I&#8217;ve used and let me pop in my VISA card.<br />
Nada.<br />
So I ran back to the car. I had made the mistake of wearing pants that morning, without dumping the financial contents of my shorts pocket first. (In other words, I had no change.) I got some change from Allison (which was a relief), bolted back down to the machine (the parking lot was on a hill), and tried to purchase three tickets. Except the stupid machine would only sell them using specific combinations of coins. I had only enough for two. So I had to run back up to the car, get another quarter, run back down to get a third ticket, and then run back up again. By this time, I was almost out of wind, and worried that if we didn&#8217;t hurry we&#8217;d miss the boat.<br />
Having not enough cash was a minor problem, so I ended up having to buy tickets with my VISA card. (At least that time it worked.) When we boarded the ship, we made a beeline for the cafeteria lineup. We were starving. BC Ferry food has a tremendous reputation for being horribly awful. We opted for the safest (and cheapest) thing on the menu that would see us through the day &#8212; a western croissant. The egg was at best egg-like, the croissant was like plastic &#8230; at least the hashbrowns were edible.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo just after 10:00, I came to notice something &#8230; my keys weren&#8217;t in my pocket. In fact, I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. Suddenly, I had a flash &#8212; in all that running back and forth to the machine, I had forgotten my car keys in my ignition. In my car. In Horseshoe Bay. On the other side of the Georgia Strait.<br />
I was suddenly not feeling so well. At some point, I need to sell my car. It&#8217;s costing me too much money to keep around, and if I can get a few thousand for it, then I can pay off most of my debt. But if someone stole it because I had mistakenly left my car keys in the ignition, then I would be severely screwed. Living away from home is sometimes not at all what it&#8217;s cracked up to be.<br />
Arriving at the Collins&#8217;, I made a hasty call to the West Vancouver Police, hoping that they might be able to do something &#8212; it would, after all, be crime prevention (not to mention idiot protection). But the constable I was speaking with suggested I call BCAA (the British Columbia Automobile Association). I thought it was a great idea. So I dialed the number, and explained it this way:<br />
BCAA: BCCA, how can I help you?<br />
Me: Hi! I did something really dumb &#8212; I just realised I locked my keys in the car.<br />
BCAA: No problem, we can get them out. Where&#8217;s your car?<br />
Me: Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.<br />
BCAA: Great! And are you with the car?<br />
Me: Well, there&#8217;s the problem.<br />
BCAA: Why?<br />
Me: I&#8217;m in Nanaimo. I just came in on the ferry.<br />
BCAA: And your keys are on the mainland&#8230;<br />
Me: Right.<br />
BCAA: Oh boy&#8230;<br />
There was the problem. BCAA required someone to be at the other end to hand the keys to (BCAA was not allowed to hang onto the keys). There&#8217;s a problem living here &#8212; I haven&#8217;t met many people, certainly a very small number whom I&#8217;d consider friends, and no-one I would consider good enough to drive all the way out to Horseshoe Bay to collect them. (Sometimes I really hate the fact that I left all my friends behind at home.) However, the BCAA operator thought that maybe the BCAA attendant could put the keys under the front seat. This was a great idea, in my opinion &#8212; Allison had a spare key we could get into the car with, and we&#8217;d be able to drive off with no problems. This was assuming, of course, that they could find my car. You see, I couldn&#8217;t tell them my license plate number &#8212; I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I knew my Ontario plate, but for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t remember my BC plate. So I had to give them a detailed description of the car. Luckily, there aren&#8217;t many cars in BC that look exactly like mine. That issue resolved, we sat down to eat before heading off to the bridal show.<br />
The show was at Beban Park, not far from the Collins&#8217;. Almost the entire show was arranged around the brides &#8212; there was almost no acknowledgement whatsoever of the fact that men even existed and were part of the process. Allison and I had a long discussion about this later on. It boils down to the wedding industry (and believe me, there is a very strong industry out there) brainwashing women to having extravagant weddings costing thousands of dollars. Allison had originally hoped to do the whole thing for $500. I knew that it would cost us about $2,000 and that&#8217;s about where we&#8217;re budgetting.<br />
We were there for research. Each table added another idea to the pot of things that we had to consider for our wedding. The biggest thing on my list was decoration. Although it is wonderful that we can get a hall in Nanaimo for a very low price (i.e. nothing), it&#8217;s not exactly the most attractive place. So I took the time to look at photographs and look at the displays to determine what we could do. That&#8217;s not to say that I wasn&#8217;t looking at anything else &#8212; I scribbled about three pages worth of notes, varying from wedding invitations to colour schemes.<br />
I was feeling horrible during most of the show. I&#8217;m convinced the eggs I ate on the ferry were making me feel ill. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling all that great either. And two fashion shows of women&#8217;s gowns was putting me out like a light. Even the overly-loud music wasn&#8217;t doing me any good.<br />
During the various raffles, Allison won a ring-bearer&#8217;s pillow. This little event changed our plans a little, and we thought we might end up using it. However, it would necessitate a few changes to our plans. At first, we thought having one of Allison&#8217;s little cousins would be a neat idea &#8230; then we scrapped it, remembering the financial input required for such a detail. The pillow would remain unused.<br />
I had thought that after the show, we&#8217;d head back to the ferry and we&#8217;d go home. But the Collins wanted to have dinner with us, especially since the Vailette&#8217;s (Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents) wanted to see us. (They had expected us the day before and had a small reception waiting for our arrival.) We dined on vegetarian lasagna (quite tasty, mushrooms aside), with a delightful cake for dessert. Allison and I had to then run for the ferry.<br />
Most of the way back, I kept hoping that my car would still be there when we arrived. I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to the prospect of having to deal with the police and ICBC to report a stolen car. As we entered the parking lot, I couldn&#8217;t see where my car was &#8212; a large white van blocked my view. But as I rounded the van, I was ecstatic to see my car in place. As expected, the keys were under the front seat.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you should get a BCAA membership &#8212; for those times when you&#8217;re hopelessly screwed, and you desperately need help. If you never use it, you might curse the expense &#8230; but the moment you need it, you&#8217;ll thank your lucky stars that you bought it. I consider mine well paid for.<br />
I grabbed my keys, popped them in the ignition, and &#8230; nothing happened. In all the running around, I had forgotten to also turn off my headlights. The battery was stone dead. Off I went again, running around to find someone with jumper cables or who could let me borrow their phone to raise BCAA again (the stupid 800 number doesn&#8217;t work in the lower mainland and I didn&#8217;t have a quarter to make the call).<br />
I lucked out with The Boathouse, a seafood restaurant at the foot of the parking lot. There I found a very kind waitress (originally from Saskatchewan) who offered to give us a boost. I was appreciative beyond words. A few minutes later, the car was running and we were on our way home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As some (or all) of you know, Allison and I got engaged during our trip to New York<!--(see Volume 6)-->. While we&#8217;ve told nearly everyone we know, we haven&#8217;t told everyone yet. More importantly, we haven&#8217;t set a date yet. There is a reason for this: Allison&#8217;s rather extensive family. In total, I have to deal with 19 people. That&#8217;s including my immediate family, my uncles, my aunts, and my cousins. Oh, and Nana, of course. Allison, on the other hand, has something on the order of 70 people in her family.<br />
We went out to Nanaimo for the weekend to visit with the Collins&#8217;, and so we could start working on the finer details of controlled mayhem. This included looking at several community halls, hotels, bed and breakfast inns, resorts, and so forth. We did find the places where we&#8217;ll most likely spend our honeymoon (we ain&#8217;t going to Hawaii, that&#8217;s for sure), but we had problems deciding where to hold everything.<br />
Our biggest problem, so we found out later, was food. We have about 130 people on a list (including significant others, if they exist). Even we if manage to whittle the cost of food down to a measly $10 a head, that still works out to $1300 in food alone. And then we&#8217;ve got the cost of the rentals, the clothes, the flowers (an extra, in my opinion, but apparently it&#8217;s unavoidable), the justice of the peace, bla bla bla. It&#8217;s going to be an expensive proposition.<br />
Upon our arrival, we went almost directly to the Wellington Community Hall. This building has been around for several decades, and has seen many events trapse through its rooms. Because Allison is part of the community, and her parents helped build and maintain the building, we stood a very good chance at getting the hall for nothing. And that would certainly help with the mounting costs of getting hitched.<br />
The next day, we looked through several different places to hold receptions, have people stay, and even hold the ceremony. (This was after we went to Costco to get Allison a membership and have lunch.) Most of the places we were interested in were up in Lantzville, Parksville, and Qualicum, all north of Nanaimo. Although all them were interesting, the single biggest problem I had was that for most (if not all) of my friends and relatives, these places were far out of their way unless they had a car. I knew that in nearly every case, cars would not really be an option.<br />
When we returned to Nanaimo, the Collins&#8217; took Allison and I to Fast Eddie&#8217;s for dinner. It&#8217;s a quasi-50&#8217;s diner-style restaurant. There we managed to totally stuff ourselves. It would probably be the last time I eat out for a while.<br />
That evening, we started solidifying a list of all the people we had to invite. It was then the distressing news of a huge food bill began to show up. Allison had been hoping to have the entire thing for only $500, something I had to admit I was a little surprised at. But she had been thinking very practically &#8212; a large pot-luck. Although I had no objection to that per se, I felt a little guilty because the burden would then be placed on her side of the family.<br />
This wedding is off to a slow start. We&#8217;ve got a lot of planning to do, and we have to start setting a date soon. And the number of people on the list will likely change a lot over the next few months. It&#8217;s too bad we couldn&#8217;t just run down to Las Vegas and get this all done with&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Summer has begun its slow end &#8212; the Pacific National Exhibition opened this weekend. I can only assume that its Toronto counterpart, the Canadian National Exhibition, also started this weekend. As back home in Ontario, the opening of the PNE is a reminder that the summer is much shorter than we all think.<br />
Allison and woke up Saturday morning, and decided that we would go to the opening day of the PNE. I had never been to the opening day of the Ex (CNE) in Toronto, let alone even been to the PNE, so I thought it would make for an interesting day.<br />
Following our brunch of breakfast burritos (scrambled eggs, black bean salsa, and some cheddar cheese wrapped up in a tortilla shell), we headed out for the Shopper&#8217;s Drug Mart. We understood we could buy passes there to the PNE. As it turned out we could only buy passes to Playland, which is the amusement park portion to the fair &#8212; and it was a lot more expensive than we thought.<br />
Nevertheless, we boarded the Skytrain to the 29th Avenue station, and took the PNE Express bus to the fair. When we got to the gate, we found that instead of buying the standard $6 ticket, we could buy a $15 dollar ticket that would get us into Cirque Parasol, a Cirque du Soliel rip-off. (There are a few of these roaming about, all trying to get their own pieces of the pie.) Thinking that this was a good idea, we put out the extra cash, and wandered in.<br />
Our first stop was the farm show, or more specifically, the farm animals. This is the last remaining part of the agricultural beginnings behind the PNE (the CNE in Toronto has a similar background). We viewed the endless lines of cows, goats, sheep, llamas (yes, llamas), chickens, and so forth. Unlike previous years (in Toronto, that is), this excursion began to bother me. I realised that all the animals in the barns were destined for a future in the slaughterhouse.<br />
Perhaps it&#8217;s conditioning from having lived here, and been exposed to a more left-wing environment (Ontarioans don&#8217;t think twice about things like this). But eating vast quantities of meat (particularly red meat) actually begin to make me feel a bit ill.<br />
Exiting the animal show, we began to wander about the fair grounds. Although we had bought tickets to Playland (the amusement park portion of the PNE), we opted not to go on it that day, preferring to look about the PNE itself. We caught a showing of Superdogs, a staged show put on by Technikal (a dog food manufacturer), which sends pooches of all sizes down a runway and over a wall (made of hollow plastic tubes, just in case the dog doesn&#8217;t make it). It&#8217;s the most popular thing to see at the PNE.<br />
After venturing around most of the PNE grounds, we went into the Dream Home. Every year, for about 80 years or so, the PNE has had a Dream Home contest. You buy tickets to attempt to win an amazing home, containing every luxury one can think of. This is the house I want. When we come back the next time, I intend to buy enough tickets to win it.<br />
Shortly thereafter, we had dinner at the smokiest place in the PNE &#8212; the barbecue chicken stand. A bad idea. Following dinner, we headed over to Cirque Parasol. It was an amazing show, considering we paid only $9 for it. It was hardly to the calibre of Cirque du Soleil (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]), but it was still pretty good.<br />
When we got out of the show, it was almost 9:30, and time for Chilliwack to play. Chilliwack is one of a hundred Canadian bands that probably never would have hit it big without the Canadian Content rule imposed by the CRTC. Without that rule, I never would have heard of Chilliwack, let alone remember over half the songs we heard. It was kinda eerie.<br />
Following the concert was a fireworks display. Compared to the Symphony of Fire, it was pathetic. But it was much longer than the Canada Day fireworks display. That was annoying. It wasn&#8217;t well organised, and it had no lead-up to the end before finishing by setting off every last firework they had. Following the works, it was time to go home and rest.<br />
The following morning, we had to go pick up my mother and grandmother (whom I refer to as Nana) from the airport. They were coming in to take a cruise out of Vancouver and up through Alaska. We rose a little later than I had hoped, and very hastily cleaned the apartment. Then we hauled out the door, and headed for Richmond. I figured we would be a little late. We more than likely saw mom&#8217;s plane land, followed shortly thereafter by Nana&#8217;s.<br />
When we arrived at the airport, they weren&#8217;t there. Allison and I hunted through the arrival lounge without being able to spot them. Of course, there was a reason for this. First of all, mom arrived through a different gate, and wound up in a different area to accept her luggage. Nana required assistance getting off the plane (she has had her hip and one of her knees replaced, so she doesn&#8217;t get around very easily anymore), and took a bit longer to arrive. Allison and I forgot to mention that we had been late in arriving&#8230;<br />
After picking up their luggage, we headed back to the car and out of the airport. We stopped in at the Milestone&#8217;s restaurant on No. 3 Road in Richmond for brunch/lunch/whatever. There we had a long talk about just about anything, but mostly how home was, how other relatives were, and so forth. Following lunch, it was time to show them where we lived.<br />
This was somewhat worrisome for me. You see, there is only one bed in the apartment. I hoped that Nana wouldn&#8217;t be offended or anything like that. Luckily, she wasn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
The conversation resumed, and we started discussing other matters. Then I found out, much to my horror, that my Uncle David had sold the cottage in Waskesiu. I was completely shocked and crestfallen. Although he did sell it to an old family friend that we could probably borrow it from, the luxury of just going was now gone. I felt like a part of my childhood had been ripped away. I had so looked forward to going back, but now that was a distant dream.<br />
Finally, we jumped back in the car and took them down to the Pan Pacific Hotel. We found out, much to our chagrin, that we could not yet check them into their room, because the room wasn&#8217;t ready yet. So we took a voucher for free drinks and sat in the lounge for a while, watching cruise ships depart and sail out of the harbour.<br />
When the room became available, we went upstairs and relaxed their for a while. It was a huge room, surpassing the size of our apartment. We watched a few more cruise ships exit the harbour (they all enter in the mornings) and listened to Enya on the in-suite stereo. After an hour or so, we opted for dinner.<br />
The in-house restaurants weren&#8217;t exactly cheap, but they weren&#8217;t over-priced either. Besides, neither Allison or I were paying. The conversation, as you can guess, continued. We talked all through dinner and dessert, until finally it was time to call it a night. Mom was three hours ahead of us, and exhausted. Nana wasn&#8217;t too far off from falling asleep either. We bid them a good night and a safe trip, and went home &#8230; after being robbed when we paid the unbelieveably high prices for the parking.</p>
