		<p>Psst! Hey, wanna hear something shocking? I&#8217;m taking yoga.<br />
Relax, I haven&#8217;t grown my hair out and gone hippy (well, the hair *has* grown out, but only because I haven&#8217;t had it cut in a month and a half), nor have I become a Stepford Wife. It&#8217;s the result of having talked to so many people about how good yoga is. I know, this kind of sounds like a &#8220;If Timmy jumped off a cliff&#8230;&#8221; thing. But admittedly, anything that&#8217;s been around for about 5,000 years and been practiced by countless millions of people can&#8217;t be all bad.<br />
Right?<br />
So when the rumour of a new yoga class starting up at work started running around, I make sure James kept me in the loop. Sure enough, when word officially came out, I forked over $80 and signed my life away (basically, a &#8220;I won&#8217;t sue you for anything stupid I do&#8221; form), bought a yoga mat (about six feet long, two and a half feet wide, and about 1/4 inch thick), and tried to prepare myself for something I&#8217;d never done before.<br />
The first class was a week ago yesterday. We had a class of about nine people (the full class will be about 10, but we have yet to have a full compliment), with participants from either Project Management or Technology, with one person from Creative. We all sit in the Theatre (chairs removed), while our instructor, Lori, leads us through the various motions.<br />
The first thing you need to know is that there isn&#8217;t just one yoga. In fact, there are 40 different kinds, such as Agni, Bhakti, Japa, Mantra, Tantra, and Hatha. The one we&#8217;re doing is called Ashtanga, which is &#8220;the unitive discipline of the eight limbs&#8221; &#8230; whatever that means. The easiest way to think of it is as the aerobic version of &#8220;regular&#8221; yoga (that&#8217;s &#8220;Hatha&#8221; yoga, in case you&#8217;re interested).<br />
The second thing is that yoga isn&#8217;t just standing (or sitting) in various poses. (Some yogas can be, but ashtanga definitely ain&#8217;t.) Each pose is for stretching, flexing, meditation, or a combination of all three. Especially with ashtanga, you&#8217;ll work up a good sweat, too. By the time you get to the end, you&#8217;ll either be dying for more, or thankful that it&#8217;s over for the day.<br />
And the third is a bit of an odd one: Breathing. Yeah, kind of an important one, I know. But it&#8217;s key to being able to ensure you&#8217;re getting not only enough oxygen to handle the workout, and block out the &#8220;discomfort&#8221; (as Lori puts it). The breathing manner is specific: Always through the nose, and using the ribs to breathe, not the belly (your abdominals should be contracted as much as possible). Inhaling, you try to make the sound &#8220;suh&#8221; (with your mouth closed, of course), while making the sound &#8220;ha&#8221; while exhaling.<br />
Sounds strange, I know. The reason is clear once you get into it, though. It&#8217;s not easy to do. In fact, when you&#8217;re in a particularly awkward pose &#8212; say, Paripurna Navasana (Full Boat Pose) &#8212; you can concentrate on getting your breathing correct and not so much on the fact that your legs feel like they&#8217;re about to rip your stomach muscles apart.<br />
Generally, each yoga session starts off with a series of three poses done in succession: Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), which moves into Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward-Facing Dog), then into Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog), which is held for up to two minutes at a time. This is to help get the body ready for the lesson it&#8217;s about to receive. It&#8217;s a bit of stretching, a bit of strength, and done just fast enough to get the blood flowing.<br />
After that, it&#8217;s up to the instructor to define their pattern of torture for the day.<br />
Day #1<br />
The rest of the class has done this before. Some of them are long-term veterans. I don&#8217;t have a clue what I&#8217;m doing. Lori&#8217;s kind enough to explain the breathing thing to me, since it makes no sense to me at first. She then suggests that I just try to concentrate on the breathing and not worry too much about getting the poses right.<br />
I spend a lot of time looking at her or others in the class, because I don&#8217;t understand a thing. Many of Lori&#8217;s words are in Sanskrit (the ancient Indian language used 5,000 years ago when yoga was first defined), and it&#8217;s traditional to use the Sanskrit words. I have no idea what &#8220;bondas&#8221; are, or what she&#8217;s saying when we&#8217;re supposed to &#8220;Svanasana&#8221;.<br />
At the end of the class, we assume a pose which is, well, laying down with eyes closed. It&#8217;s supposed to be for relaxation, but a few of us (not me) fall asleep. I find yoga, as experienced, a lot easier than I thought. So I gather, Lori took it light on us.<br />
Day #2<br />
This time, I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;ve got an idea of what yoga is, I sort of know the motions (well, some of them), and I&#8217;m prepared for the run. We do the opening, and then start trying a few new poses we didn&#8217;t do the week before. Some are easy, some are not. Lori also kicks it up a notch, and the class is bit harder than the first one. In general, I&#8217;m able to keep up.<br />
The breathing is difficult, and I often find myself remembering how I&#8217;m supposed to breathe. It helps me concentrate on something other than the severe wobbling on my legs in some of the poses. (The wobbling, incidentally, is partly due to the position that I&#8217;m in, and partly due to trying to keep my balance without falling over.)<br />
About halfway through the class, I realized I could get into full lotus pose. (Sitting down, it&#8217;s where your feet cross, heels near or touching the hips.) I haven&#8217;t done it in about two decades, but not for lack of trying &#8212; I just never thought to. I was quite amazed with myself, actually.<br />
I realize that the final pose is actually a pose, and not just us lying down. It&#8217;s called Savasana (Corpse Pose) and is designed as a relaxtion and meditative state. The idea is to calm the body and the mind after doing countless things to it. I think I&#8217;m going to start practicing this every night when I go to bed &#8212; I always want to fall asleep.<br />
Day #3<br />
I&#8217;m keen, but a little hesitant. Why? Well, the day before, I did a fairly strenuous leg workout at the gym. Lately, this hasn&#8217;t been too much of a problem, as the protein powder I now take seems to keep the recovery period extremely short. However, having missed most of last week to schedule and exhaustion, my legs took a little longer to heal up.<br />
Based on the previous class, I figured I&#8217;d have a good chance to stretch out my quadriceps (the troublesome muscles in question). What I didn&#8217;t figure on was Lori deciding to crank up the difficulty and really put us through our paces. And, I hope by complete coincidence, really focus on our legs.<br />
One particular pose she put us into, the name of which I don&#8217;t know, pretty much put me over the edge. Basically, you&#8217;re bend forward at the waist, feet hip-width apart and bent at the knees. Keeping the feet flat on the floor, you feed one arm between the legs, and the other wraps around your back, linking somewhere around your rear end. Normally, this isn&#8217;t a problem for me to do. However, the pain in my already-sore thighs was &#8230; exquisite.<br />
Ever felt like your quadriceps were going to physically separate from your femur?<br />
I had to drop out of the pose twice, especially after my left thigh started cramping. Not a good sign.<br />
We also did a pose that I found quite enjoyable. It goes like this: Sitting, bring your feet in as tight as you can to your groin. Then have the instructor stand on your knees while forcing your head down so that your forehead touches your toes.<br />
Now here&#8217;s the kicker: I liked it. (But then, I have a very flexible groin.)<br />
Another new position we was Bakasana (Crane Pose). It&#8217;s a bit of an odd one. You start with hands placed on the mat, shoulder-width apart, fingers spread widely. Then lean forward onto your arms, and place your knees just above the elbows, and roll forward until your feet come off the ground. Ideally, you&#8217;ll be standing on your hands, with (surprisingly) little stress on your wrist.<br />
It&#8217;s a hard position, partly due to upper body strength, but also due to balance. I was actually quite amazed that I could even get into it. Unfortunately, while my strength seemed to be agreeing, my balance wasn&#8217;t as cooperative. I muttered in my thoughts:<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; oh, crap &#8230;&#8221;<br />
Thump.<br />
Right on my head, too. I had laughed at my friend because she, while doing the same pose at her class, had landed on her face. She quite rightly returned the favour when I told her about my limited success.<br />
Then we moved onto headstands. I hadn&#8217;t done one since I was in high school. I need a little practice. Surprisingly enough, getting up wasn&#8217;t really that hard. It was staying there. I thought I&#8217;d had it balanced well. But when I felt my feet having gone past the point of no return, all I could was do a tuck and roll out of what would have been a complete collapse.<br />
By the end of the class, my legs were hamburger formed into two bulky bags that somehow supported my torso and allowed me to walk. Walking down the stairs was difficult. (Heck, walking on a horizontal surface was a bit of a challenge.) I fully expected to pay for it the following morning.<br />
But despite how badly I hurt, I woke up relatively pain-free this morning. Somehow, all the stretching cancelled out the muscle shredding, and I was able to move without a wheelchair. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next class on Tuesday, without a clue of what Lori is going to do to us next. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting set of classes, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to get a lot out of yoga.<br />
The only drawback? I feel like going into Savasana during meetings&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It seems that Critical Mass is losing too many good people within a very short period of time. First, it was a round of layoffs nearly three weeks ago. Now it&#8217;s a series of resignations. Among them is Arthur.<br />
Arthur came to Critical Mass about two months after I&#8217;d started. He&#8217;d moved into the interactive agency world after realizing that banking just wasn&#8217;t for him. He sat next to me in our old building. Starting off in QA, Arthur worked himself up to the point where he could switch into Web Development, where he did a variety of projects before landing on the Mercedes-Benz account.<br />
For at least two years, Arthur was the lead Web Developer on the Dealers projects, although last year he also ran the Web Development end of the Collection migration. In no case an easy job. He worked long hours when necessary, and never once complained about the job. Truly a model employee.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t work that defined him. It was being himself. He&#8217;s thoughtful, kind, caring, always willing to help, and will go out of his way to take on a challenge when he sees the opportunity. This is how Arthur came to be my coach and mentor for physical fitness. He&#8217;s the one who set me up with my program, changed my eating habits, and encouraged me to try different things and move ahead.<br />
And I wasn&#8217;t the only one who had seen this sort of thing in him. Many people at Critical Mass who have come to know Arthur over the last three and a half years would be sad to see him go. Which is why on Friday, we held a going-away party for him at Vicious Circle.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people showed up, but we&#8217;d pulled out well in excess of 50 people. We had three our four large tables at the club filled with folks. Well, all but one person in particular. Arthur was late. Somehow, I wasn&#8217;t particularly surprised that the guest of honour was running 45 minutes late.<br />
People came and went over the next few hours. Soon, we were down to a solitary table, harbouring Arthur, Angie, Pat, Colin, Reid, Jude, Rudy, John, and myself. Somewhere around midnight (I&#8217;m guessing), we opted to move to a different venue. So we were off in a few vehicles for what we call the No Name Lounge, a club near 17th Ave. and 14th St. that, quite literally, has no name. (It&#8217;s probably a numbered company for the purposes of liquor licenses, et al.)<br />
We&#8217;d been there once before for Rudy&#8217;s little send off before he&#8217;d vanished to the South Pacific for a month over Christmas. There were significantly more people inside this time around, but as was the case before, the music was stellar, and the venue loads of fun.<br />
Just after 1:30, we&#8217;d realized that we&#8217;d had enough for one night. Arthur, Rudy, and Jude had already vanished for the Cherry Lounge, but the rest of us were not to follow. Angie went home (Reid making sure she got there okay), while Pat, John, Colin, and I saddled up for the ride home.<br />
Dropping John off at his place, Pat, Colin, and I headed in search of sustinence. We were starving. A night of revelry and far too much beer for our own good (we were pretty much sober by this point, incidentally) brought us to the most popular eatery on 17th Ave. for those out partying: Wicked Wedge. A slice of a &#8220;Chief Wiggum&#8221; pizza and a small Coke did wonders for me &#8230; and probably not for my diet. (I was willing to make an exception.)<br />
Pat and I drove Colin up to his place in Rocky Ridge (pretty much most of the way to Cochrane), engaging in a bitch-fest the likes of which I haven&#8217;t been in for a very long time. The three of us are long-time Critical Mass veterans (except that Pat was laid off three weeks ago), so we&#8217;ve seen it all. Literally. And we know what&#8217;s good and what needs help.<br />
*Sigh* If only we ran things. (And while I&#8217;m dreaming about things I don&#8217;t really want, I&#8217;d like to be a famous movie star.)<br />
Pat dropped me off just after 3:00. The house was cold and dark. But I didn&#8217;t mind at all. I crawled into bed, curled up in a fetal position, and let the sleep of the wicked steal me away for a few hours. I just hope no-one else leaves anytime soon. I don&#8217;t think my body can take it.<br />
In a couple of weeks, Arthur leaves for Toronto. No more morning workout sessions. No more suggestions on how to improve. No more crack comments as he passes my desk. (Hmmm&#8230; suddenly, this isn&#8217;t looking like such a bad thing.) But such is life. You can&#8217;t get into a pattern for too long before something has to change.<br />
Take care, Arthur! I&#8217;m sure our paths will cross again.</p>

		<p>A year and a day ago (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/02/ymca-starting-exercise/">Starting exercise at the YMCA</a>), I made the decision to move from my slovenly-like appearance to something a little more healthy.<br />
I signed up at the Eau Claire YMCA, and started my exercise regimen. And for about six months, the only thing I really did was torture myself getting up at 5:20 in the morning. I had the right idea, but the wrong plan. This is where Arthur stepped in.<br />
Until the end of last week, Arthur was an employee of Critical Mass, a friend, and my gym coach. He&#8217;d get on my case if I failed to show up in the morning. He&#8217;d give me grief for eating the &#8220;wrong things&#8221;. He became determined to whip me into shape, even if it killed me.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hereby lodge as much a formal complaint to the final outcome of last night&#8217;s team building event as one can without a process by which to handle it. So I&#8217;m throwing it out on the Internet for all to see.<br />
But more on that in a minute &#8230; or five.<br />
This week, Critical Mass&#8217; first and still largest client, Mercedes-Benz USA, came up to the mind-numbingly cold Great White North of Calgary for Year 2004 planning meetings.<br />
Client meetings can go one of two ways: good, and horrible. I have the fortune, thus far, of never having had the latter. All of the client meetings have been good: productive, educational, if perhaps a little dry from time to time. But at the end of the day, you can walk off knowing that you&#8217;ve done a good job.<br />
I&#8217;ve been on the Mercedes account for over three years, now. Overall, it&#8217;s been a fairly good (albeit trying) experience. But in those three years, I hadn&#8217;t really met the client before. So walking onto the fourth floor, I ran into a lot of people I had never really met before.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s not entirely fair. I had &#8220;met&#8221; most of them during a previous visit, about this time last year (before I was promoted into the lead team). They came by on a tour, shook hands, I did a 30-second unprepared song and dance, they walked off. Now I had to remember their names and interact with them. (Not that is a bad thing in any way.)<br />
Wednesday was our first day of meetings. Eight o&#8217;clock in the morning until after five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. Straight. Wednesday night was the first event, which was a kind of cooking class. Can&#8217;t tell you anything about it, though. Wasn&#8217;t invited. (Although I&#8217;m a lead, apparently I&#8217;m not important enough to be considered for some things &#8230; the rel reason was due to too many people on the team, and that I don&#8217;t have direct contact with the client on a regular basis).<br />
The first activity of the day, though, was a team-building event. Basically, personality bingo. We had to go around the room and find things that people could do or have done (for example, who could drive stick shift or who had been to five countries).<br />
The next thing was a review of management types. We had all done a survey that produced our management strengths. The result is one of four &#8220;colours&#8221;: red (direct and to-the-point), green (extroverted), blue (planning), and yellow (structured). The idea is to focus on the strengths, and know how you communicate with other colours.<br />
I&#8217;m a blue, for the record. It&#8217;s characterized by taking time to get all the facts, understand the situation, and plan things out. Supposedly, one of the other characteristics is a long fuse (apparently, we can take a lot of crap); but when it burns out, run.<br />
At the time I saw that characteristic, I actually took a bit of offence. I used to be like that. Won&#8217;t deny it &#8212; can&#8217;t deny it. But I&#8217;ve taken great strides in keeping my temper in check. I would even go so far as to say that I&#8217;m a lot more laid back than I used to be.<br />
Thursday. Stories of the dinner the night before. More meetings. A little later of a start, but the same sort of results. The technology review got booted twice, and ultimately delayed until today (we&#8217;re just getting underway as I type this, and I wonder if we&#8217;ll be getting to it at all).<br />
The thing we looked forward to most, though, was the team event. This typically happens on the last night of a meetings. It&#8217;s always different, but almost always fun. I don&#8217;t know what they did last time, but a couple years ago they did the O-Lame-Pics, which was some combination of winter &#8220;sports&#8221;. This year was something different.<br />
At first, we were actually told we needed to bring snowpants. I have no idea why, but I can only guess there was something to do with, well, snow. (I know, took a real stretch of deduction.) That was changed when we were told that we would not be outdoors for more than seven minutes at a time. But we were not told what the event was. All we were told was to be in the Walker Room of the Hyatt hotel at 18:15.<br />
At about 18:30, the game was finally announced: The Amazing Freeze. Based on the reality show &#8220;The Amazing Race&#8221;, the idea was that we would run around downtown Calgary, doing various events and getting clues to the next event.<br />
Sounds pretty straight-forward, eh? Well, here&#8217;s something to really throw a wrench in your aspirations. We were &#8220;randomly&#8221; (I assume randomness, but have to really wonder) put into teams of 5-6 people. While most of the teams were a blend of Critical Mass and Mercedes-Benz USA employees. As was with mine. Except for one detail.<br />
Everyone else was from New York. I was the only one who had any idea of where these places were.<br />
The teams were named by model. We were Team SL500 (my favourite Benz, although I&#8217;ll never be able to afford one). There was Anne, our account manager in New York; Ed, who runs the Dealers program at Mercedes; Diane, who runs the Owners program at Mercedes; Lark, who is one of Mercedes IT&#8217;s representatives; and yours truly.<br />
We were handed knapsacks. In these knapsacks were bottles of water, a pad of paper, two taxi chits, a couple of pens, and an emergency phone number to call in the event you somehow got lost.<br />
As we had already been drinking when we were handed the bag, the logical thing to do was replace the bottles of water with bottles of beer and wine. (Hey, if you&#8217;re gonna run around downtown Calgary like maniacs, you might as well be loaded while doing it.)<br />
We then got our first clue. The entire group of about 25 people rushed out of the hotel en masse (I can only imagine what the other guests were thinking), dashing off to their first destinations. Three groups (including ours) ended up at the James Joyce. First challenge: sidle up to the bar, and suck back a few shots. Jim Beam. Blech.<br />
Next clue took us to the Calgary Tower. I started making the team run. I got caught up in the competition. This was a bit of a challenge, because Lark and Ed don&#8217;t run, Diane is a self-professed &#8220;lazy New Yorker&#8221;, and I had a little too much energy for my own good. We ran across red lights.<br />
A list of 10 questions, including the name of the building with a yellow plane in its lobby (the Petro-Canada Tower), the date Calgary became a city (1884), or what building was built for the 1983 Summer Games (the Lindsay Park facility, now known as the Talisman Centre, which had been the velodrome, I believe). Assuming you didn&#8217;t know the answers, you could find them by using four kiosks around the tower&#8217;s observation level.<br />
We ran a lot.<br />
Questions filled in, we caught the elevator back down. As we caught our breath, we had an Australian couple (I think they were Australian) take our team photo. In the spirit of the game, and because the shots had kicked in by that time, Lark offered the couple one of our bottles of beer.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen such a confused and bewildered look before in my life.<br />
Turning the question sheet over to the clerk at the desk (who had answered &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; when asked if he would help us with the question sheet), we received our next clue. It took a moment for me to figure out what it said (remember, the shots had kicked in), and we ran off to Winner&#8217;s to get a team &#8220;uniform&#8221; that could be purchased for CDN$60.<br />
The Winner&#8217;s staff were probably more confused than the couple in the elevator. All they knew was that there would be teams of people running through the store on some goofy quest. But first, we needed a team uniform. The team made a quick decision: socks. Really ugly ones. Ed was so enthusiastic, he ripped them from the racks, the little plastic clips flying everywhere. Ed ran back to the cashier, Diane apologising to the clerk for our haste.<br />
Right about then, Lark started telling the clerk (who was holding our clue envelopes) that she was with another team. Somehow, she got the CLK500 envelope. At this point, Diane and I got on the fairness bandwagon and decried Lark&#8217;s underhandedness, and made her hand it back.<br />
If we&#8217;d been thinking, we would have grabbed all the envelopes and scrambled the clues (they were all different). Oh well, lesson learned.<br />
Atrocious socks in hand, we were off to the Glenbow Museum. (Yes, running. Well, I was. The rest of the team, not so much.) We had a choice: either run through the Bog People exhibit (which I saw about a week and a half ago), or take the detour. The detour won, hands-down.<br />
The detour was simple, though: tie ourselves together with scarves, run out to Macleod Trail, and run back. The whole thing took about 30 seconds. We chanted like Marines as we jogged down the block and back. Next clue: Off to sushi.<br />
If there was one key mistake that we made, it was following the instructions and taking the C-Train. If we&#8217;d been thinking, we&#8217;d have taken a taxi. So we had to wait 10 minutes for a train to show up.<br />
But we sort of played the taxi angle. While the rest of us waited on the platform, Ed wandered out to the road to flag something down. He didn&#8217;t find a taxi, but managed to frighten some poor woman in a minivan (she locked her doors), tried to flag down one of Calgary Transit&#8217;s community busses, and almost stopped a police SUV.<br />
The train finally showed up, and we headed off to the 7th St. stop, at the other end of downtown. We were the last team to get to Sushi Hiro (but not because we were slow; that was just our last stop). We had to wait for the previous team to finish and leave.<br />
The game was a kind of fear factor: people had to eat sushi. Oh. My. Such fear. The longest part of the effort was laying claim to the sushi we wanted to eat. It disappeared in less time than we&#8217;d had to wait to eat it. (Lark pulled out the wine, and Ed cracked a beer &#8230; with his teeth, no less!) Back out the door, we started to flag down a cab, only to luck into having a cab be there, waiting. (It had been called by a previous team, and had been late arriving.) We were off to our final stop: Catch Restaurant.<br />
We didn&#8217;t use the taxi chits, Ed paid for the cab with cash. In the door, and up the stairs, we were the first team to arrive. We even had to find Eryn, who was more-or-less the ringleader of the whole event. The elation of being first, despite the odds that were against us, was outstanding.<br />
The rest of the teams started arriving. By the time we got back downstairs (we weren&#8217;t allowed upstairs yet, so had to wait in the Oyster Bar), the second team had arrived. It wasn&#8217;t long before most of the teams had finished, and we were allowed back upstairs.<br />
Tales from the teams&#8217; exploits were traded around. No-one had gotten lost, but we weren&#8217;t the only ones to make mistakes. One team actually walked to Sushi Hiro and back, which added a significant portion of time to their race.<br />
We sat down to dinner, which consisted of salad or clam and oyster chowder, haibut or beef, and a chocolate mousse cake. Very tasty.<br />
Awards for the teams were handed out, from last to first. Eryn added colour commentary, which was definitely playful. Everyone was having fun. At least until they announced the winner.<br />
A different team supposedly won. They weren&#8217;t even the second team to come through the door! I was dumbfounded! And it was because, of all things, because they&#8217;d had to wait for sushi, so they got a time bonus.<br />
Remember that long fuse? It burned out.<br />
Considering the difficulties our team faced, we should have been granted a lot more leniency. But no, somewhere a serious breech of the rules occured and the winning team didn&#8217;t actually win. To put it succinctly, we were robbed.<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m still steamed. We got a coffee mug. Much better than the little keychain light, teddy bear, or box of Smarties of the other teams (the &#8220;winning&#8221; team made off like kings), but it&#8217;s not the prize that&#8217;s at issue here! It&#8217;s the principle of the thing. We&#8217;d won, pure and simple. We followed the rules (despite Lark&#8217;s attempt at sabotage), and finished first. Why should we get penalized because another team had to wait for something out of their control?<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a game, Geoff, don&#8217;t take it so personally!&#8221;<br />
Yeah, yeah, I know. Considering all the things we had to, the excellent team building we had done, the &#8220;process&#8221; we&#8217;re supposed to be following (as a part of our jobs), and arriving first, all I wanted was to cheer our vistory. I couldn&#8217;t care less about winning anything. The fact that four Americans had to put their faith in a lone Canuck not to get them lost, come together as a team, and still complete the course before everyone else should garner the recognition. What else can I say? I got caught up in the competitivenes.<br />
Yeah, so this is my formal complaint. We won, darn it, and you can&#8217;t take that away from us. Take your fancy backpacks, I don&#8217;t care! (I have one, anyway.) I have the satisfaction that we are #1.<br />
Now before everyone thinks I&#8217;m too negative about all this, make no mistake: I had fun. A lot of fun. I would do it again in a second. It was planned wonderfully, executed brilliantly, and (outcome notwithstanding) an excellent idea for the event. I have to keep it in mind should I ever have to do this sort of thing again.<br />
But next time, I&#8217;m switching the envelopes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, David Bowie reminded us all how a concert should be done.<br />
Well, technically *last* night, but since it&#8217;s just after midnight as I write this, it&#8217;s still the same night. Anyway, you get the point.<br />
Tamara and I had planned this from several months ago (sometime in September or October), when we&#8217;d heard about an IMAX presentation of David Bowie&#8217;s new album, &#8220;Reality&#8221;. The two of us hussled down to the Paramount Chinook to score some tickets to watch the show. As it turned out, it was the best move we could make. As a result of that show, we&#8217;d found out that members of Bowie&#8217;s fan club had access to an Internet presale of tickets to his concert in Calgary.<br />
Within moments of getting home, Tamara had joined the club, and we had ordered tickets for us, Tamara&#8217;s parents, and a few of Tamara&#8217;s friends. But the choice tickets went to us.<br />
On the floor. In the eighth row. We&#8217;d be able to see Bowie&#8217;s *sweat*.<br />
Well, you can imagine the wait. It was long. Both of us wanted to see this show. For both Tamara and I, seeing David Bowie play is one of those (potentially) once-in-a-lifetime things. And unlike other acts who come and go, Bowie is a monolith in the industry &#8212; the one other acts look to. Elvis might have been the King, but it is the Thin White Duke who rules.<br />
The first time I&#8217;d heard David Bowie was in the early 80s. It was one song: &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;, from his &#8220;Let&#8217;s Dance&#8221; album. I don&#8217;t know what it was. Hook, line, and sinker. Since then, I&#8217;ve kept track of David&#8217;s career &#8212; not only his musical one, but also his acting (Bowie&#8217;s done several movies, including Jim Henson&#8217;s &#8220;Labyrinth&#8221; and &#8220;The Linguine Incident&#8221;). Ever since that first song, I&#8217;ve been a fan.<br />
We started the evening at Catch. I had given Tamara a gift certificate for Christmas, as she had regularly expressed her desire to eat there. I endulged (perhaps a little too much, but hey, it&#8217;s been a rough week). Unfortunately, we ended up running a little late, so we left without noticing that Tamara&#8217;s $50 certificate hadn&#8217;t, in fact, come off the bill. Something I&#8217;ll have to address in the morning.<br />
We grabbed a taxi to the Saddledome, arriving partway into Macy Gray&#8217;s opening act. (Bowie, if nothing else, knows that while the opening act should never be better than the headliner, it still needs to be solid.) My only regret of the evening (the gift certificate fiasco notwithstanding) was missing part of Macy Gray&#8217;s act.<br />
Arriving on the floor, we had to have someone guide us to our seats, not having a clue where they were. We figured we were off to the sides, which would have been fine for us. We just wanted to see the show. But the guide led us to the middle of the rows, eight away from the stage. Our seats were nearly dead-centre. We could see the individual hair fibres in Macy Gray&#8217;s afro.<br />
Tamara and I were damn near giddy with delight.<br />
Macy Gray is a solid performer. A bit of a freak, perhaps, but a total class act. And her band takes a great deal of pride in the work that they do. The result is an amazing show. I would gladly see Macy Gray again, should she swing around this area. (And a note to all of you who have yet to see David Bowie&#8217;s Reality show &#8212; don&#8217;t show up late! You won&#8217;t be disappointed.)<br />
The house lights soon came up, and the roadies began to set up for Bowie. Tamara disappeared for a while with her father (he and Tamara&#8217;s mother were a row behind us, about six seats to the right), returning about 10 minutes before the show with a tour book, and two drinks (I was the recipient of a free beer). And we waited.<br />
But we didn&#8217;t have to wait long. About 20:45, the music on the PA system changed, and suddenly you could hear David&#8217;s voice, and the band started playing. But no-one was on stage, and the lights hadn&#8217;t yet dimmed. The pixelboard behind the performer&#8217;s area came to life, showing an animated version of the band practicing. The lights started going out. The crowd was getting loud.<br />
It was time.<br />
One by one, David Bowie&#8217;s band started entering the stage. People whose names are usually forgotten were cheered loudly as they took their positions. There was a long pause from when the last one picked up their instrument until David walked out on stage, to deafening cheers and whistles. Without missing a single beat, they jumped right into what appears to be the opening song on the tour, &#8220;Rebel Rebel&#8221;.<br />
It was amazing. For the next two hours, David and his band flipped around over 35 years of music, switching from songs from his new album, to songs from his first, and almost every album in between. Ones you never heard of, ones that you heard yesterday, and ones that were great almost a generation ago. All but two or three, I knew or at least had heard once before.<br />
David Bowie isn&#8217;t just a singer-songwriter. He&#8217;s a performer. When he&#8217;s just singing, he&#8217;s acting. He&#8217;s making love to the audience because he wants to draw them into his world. For two hours, that&#8217;s precisely what happened. You were absorbed by his energy (I can only hope to look like him when I&#8217;m 57 years old), his passion, and his presence. He commanded without even having to really try.<br />
&#8220;Reality&#8221;, &#8220;New Killer Star&#8221;, &#8220;Fame&#8221;, &#8220;Under Pressure&#8221; (David&#8217;s bassist sings Freddie Mercury&#8217;s part amazingly well), &#8220;Life on Mars?&#8221;, &#8220;Ashes to Ashes&#8221;, &#8220;Heroes&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m Afraid of Americans&#8221; (which got a huge boost from the audience), &#8220;Ziggy Stardust&#8221;, and many others were all readily cheered. It was, without a doubt, one of the loudest concerts I&#8217;d been to &#8212; and not because of the band. (My ears are ringing, but I&#8217;ve been to louder, and much worse, concerts.)<br />
Early in the show, David decided that we&#8217;d done such a good job singing &#8220;All The Young Dudes&#8221;, that we could sing &#8220;China Girl&#8221; without him. The band started playing, but when the singing should have started, there wasn&#8217;t a peep from the audience (at least that you could hear). Bowie looked quite disgusted. He stopped the band, walked up to the mike, and announced:<br />
&#8220;That was fucking tragic.&#8221;<br />
He laughed with the rest of us, and then restarted the song, this time taking lead of the vocals. He seemed to like the audience participation. During his 5-6 song encore (I&#8217;m not sure exactly how many songs he did), he played a personal favourite: &#8220;Suffragette City&#8221;. There&#8217;s just nothing quite like hearing 13-odd thousand people all screaming: &#8220;Wham, bam, thank you, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; at the top of their lungs.<br />
There were two songs that I&#8217;d wanted to hear: &#8220;Space Oddity&#8221; and my personal favourite, &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;. According to his website, however, those songs haven&#8217;t appeared on any of his play lists. *Sigh* Well, if nothing else, it just gives me an excuse to see him the next time he&#8217;s anywhere in the area &#8230; which means most of this section of North America, of course.<br />
When the house lights came back on, it was hard to believe it was over. The energy had been amazing &#8212; we could have easily listened for another two hours. But it was almost 23:00, and time for most people to go home. (Some of us have to work tomorrow.)<br />
Tonight, David Bowie rocked Calgary. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of the Thin White Duke.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every year, Critical Mass holds its annual holiday party. For the first two years of my employ, they were Christmas parties (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]); the two since then have both been New Year parties (see [[Critical Mass New Year Party 2003]] photos). I assume this is because scheduling things before Christmas is far more difficult. And really, it&#8217;s nice to have party that&#8217;s not heavily influenced by a holiday.<br />
Last year, we hung out at the Destination: Africa pavillion at the Zoo. A neat place, to be sure, but you can&#8217;t go to the same place twice in a row (if at all). So this year (and last night, to be specific), we opted for something different. It was a little more downplayed than last year &#8212; the Palomino Room at the Roundup Centre. Not exactly the Fairmont Palliser, but the venue wasn&#8217;t going to be the central point.<br />
Kristen and I arrived just as the event was beginning. We could have gone for the slightly more fashionably-late, but considering there was a hockey game and the motorcycle show both on that evening (not to mention other parties), I wanted to take advantage of the nearby parking at the office. Thankfully, we were not the first to show.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the theme of the evening was, but the focal point was money. As each person arrived, they were given an envelope that contained the ubiquitous drink tickets, and $20,000 in funny money for each person. (Kristen and I had a total of $40,000 between the two of us.) The funny money was for use at the gaming tables.<br />
The Lions Club provided the entertainment &#8212; several blackjack tables, a roulette table, and two other games that I really don&#8217;t know the name of, but generally don&#8217;t see outside of carnival midways. The idea of these tables was to turn your $20,000 into much more. This money would be used after the tables closed to bid on a wide range of prizes, including a carpet steamer, camera, kid&#8217;s play easel, coffee maker, power saw, and a monstrous George Foreman grill.<br />
We mingled near the door, getting a feel for the near-empty room. James bounded up from out of nowhere, already quite giddy. He, Scott, and Tyler were providing the music that evening, taking turns DJing. (I would believe their task to be wholly successful, but in discussing the aftermath with James earlier today, found that there were those who were less than impressed. To them, I can only feel pity, for not appreciating that these gentlemen volunteered their time. They sacrified their party time so that the rest would not suffer the consequences of the DJ we had last year.)<br />
James proceeded to note my demure behaviour, which while I did not take offense in, could not understand how he noticed so quickly, having only just arrived. We were then taken for a quick tour to the stage to view the setup for the evening. Most of what James said registered somewhere in the recesses of my mind, but only superficially &#8212; he was talking so fast I could barely understand him.<br />
Amy and Jen arrived soon thereafter, so the four of us (James remained on stage) took Table 15. We would be accompanied by Angie and Tyler, and Luke and Allison. With our things &#8220;stashed&#8221;, we proceeded to find out if we were lucky in cards.<br />
Neither Kristen or I had played blackjack before. And we were at a table with a dealer whose accent, unfortunately, was difficult to hear at times (over the music and other people). But we began to get the basics down. The principle is easy enough (closest to 21 without going over, and it&#8217;s the dealer vs. everyone else). For a while, we were up and down like yo-yos, before Kristen hit a big winning streak, which recovered all our lost funds, plus $1,000 &#8230; which was the smallest bill, by the way, so don&#8217;t think we were *that* successful.<br />
Dinner was called around 6:30 or so, which was an excuse to hit the lines. Of our table, we were the last to arrive. But at least the food was good. (Terri had warned me that Stampede Catering was not the best, so we apparently had tried to get another caterer. But only Stampede Catering will cater an event on the Stampede grounds.) Roast vegetables, potatoes, chicken, and a wonderful roast beef (with a wild mushroom gravy that I thought was wonderful). Hard to eat everything, though. Especially since we needed to save room for dessert.<br />
And were we glad we did. Now the chocolate wasn&#8217;t Bernard Callebaut (at least, I don&#8217;t believe it was), but it was still very tasty. The shocker for the night, however, was the baklava. Until last night, I wasn&#8217;t really a baklava fan. I&#8217;d had it before, but it hadn&#8217;t done anything for me. Kristen, however, could not get over how good it was. So I had to try. I was beside myself.<br />
I love chocolate. I mean, I *really* love chocolate. It&#8217;s one of my weaknesses. But this simple Greek pastry was like having someone open the door into a new world of taste experiences. I think the main ingredient was pure crack cocaine, because it was enough for Kristen and I to go back for seconds, thus eliminating the remainder of baklava from the table. (Yes, we were greedy. So sue me.)<br />
Following dinner, the gaming tables resumed with frenzy. Kristen and I tried our hands again at 21, only to find that our luck wasn&#8217;t as good as we&#8217;d thought. Finally, Kristen convinced me to try roulette &#8212; something Tamara would have loved, had she been able to come. I&#8217;d never played it before, though I knew the rules from having watched Tamara and Adrian on a couple of occassions.<br />
Like blackjack, roulette does involve some strategy, and you can do quite well, depending on how you place bets. Placing directly on the numbers the most risky, but has the highest payoff. Playing on the variations (colours, odd/even, number ranges) tends to reduce the risk. It took me a while to listen to my instinct and hope that we did well.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how much we were down when we started (we&#8217;d both had our clocks cleaned at the last blackjack table), but in the last spin of the roulette table before it closed, earned back enough money to have the original $40,000 restored. I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Several others did much better, going into the hundreds of thousands. But even that would not be enough for the bidding wars that were about to break out.<br />
With the gaming complete, the silent auction went into overdrive. The first table closed 30 minutes after gaming ended, so the bidding was fierce. The top price was $325,000 for the carpet cleaner. I was impressed &#8212; I didn&#8217;t think anyone could win so much. It was then that it dawned on us &#8230; not all the winnings were from one person.<br />
Pooling had begun. Deals were struck, begging was in full force. Eyes were locked on certain items, and the bids were rising fast. It was like watching an episode of &#8220;Survivor&#8221;. Soon, it was just the second table. Minimum bid? Somewhere around $200,000. Rumours of someone walking around with $5 million began to spread. False values were thrown around like rice at a wedding. Our paltry $40,000 was donated to the cause, so Luke could acquire the coffee maker of his dreams.<br />
Oddly enough, it would be the coffee maker that acquired the most attention, though for reasons I may never fully understand. In the waning seconds of the bidding, the war went to extremes, with people turning over huge sums of cash to a select few still engaged in the fight. When the ball dropped and the bidding closed, the final values were unbelievable. The coffee maker drew the biggest bid of the night, almost doubling that of the professional-looking George Foreman grill.<br />
Final bid: $1 million.<br />
All I can say is, that had better be one damn fine cup of coffee.<br />
The wars over and the dust settled, there were a few announcements, and James began his run at the turntables. Some people stayed at danced, some headed out. We stuck around for about 45 minutes or so, before we, too, headed out. Normally, I would shut the party down. For once, I wasn&#8217;t really upset about leaving early.<br />
It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what they can plan for next year.</p>

		<p>First off, Happy New Year everyone!<br />
2003 was quite a year &#8212; quite a few good things, and a number of bad ones. In fact, not a lot of good ones, worldly-speaking, that is. Although not all the &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; lists are out yet, the ones that are on the Internet are (not surprisingly) mostly negative. Lots of death and tragedy, with the odd curling win to make things brighter. Let&#8217;s just hope this year comes with a little less strife than the year past.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept fitfully. I don&#8217;t really know why. But when I awoke Christmas morning, there was a slight sense of excitement. Perhaps I&#8217;d been depressed the day before and not taken notice. (The reason why, of course, still remains a mystery.) It&#8217;s just as easy to believe that there was nothing special about this day, nothing more than the same dull drudgery I feel that I face more often than I care to admit to.<br />
I showered, shaved, and dressed for the day. I would not return until after Christmas dinner, so the objective was to look as presentable as possible, without being uncomfortable all day long. Fed the cat, and hopped in my car for Brenda and Mike&#8217;s. I was to be there for 9:00, so we could begin Christmas morning.<br />
Mom and Nana were running a little late, but not so much that the entire day was thrown out of whack. They arrived not long after me, and with mimosas and/or coffee in hand, we proceeded to the living room. There were six of us, and more than enough presents all around. We even had stockings, despite protests that we didn&#8217;t really need them.<br />
Inside, the slight excitement grew. Unfortunately, the feeling was a little sickening, becase it felt materialistic. I didn&#8217;t want to receive gifts so much as I wanted to give them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I like receiving gifts as much as the next person, but the acquisition of materials goods just isn&#8217;t the driving force for me that used to rule my early childhood. The anticipation, however &#8212; that I will never miss.<br />
Jen got a digital camera, one she has to share with Brenda. The key reason is that so Jen will have it when she goes to Japan with me in late March. It will be an experience of a lifetime, and she needs to record every event. Mike and Jen played with it most of the morning &#8230; no, I take that back &#8212; most of the day. Mom received a personal chef service from the family, and a foot massager from Cathy, Craig, and myself. Brenda received some nice clothes, as did Nana. Mike made off with a Belgian beer selection.<br />
As for me, I got a good book on the Canadian Pacific Railway (&#8220;Stand Fast, Craigellachie!&#8221;), a pocket watch with an engraved train, funds for landscaping the house, movies, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and a cuckoo clock. The clock, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a Mini-brand product. Every hour, instead of a little bird, a little red car pops out of its little doors, revs its engine, and beeps its horn. Cathy couldn&#8217;t resist getting it for me. I could barely stop giggling.<br />
The video game (&#8220;Grand Theft Auto&#8221;) came from Tamara, my roommate. This had been a trying year for us. Tamara was laid off from Critical Mass in June. In lieu of her having to move out, I just didn&#8217;t ask for rent. Until she was contracted back (for five months!), Tamara didn&#8217;t pay rent. I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; why would I do that? Simple: It&#8217;s far harder to find a perfect roommate than it is to lose money. Considering how well we get along, the last thing I needed was for her to have to move out. With her contract now expired, that is a possibility, but one I hope won&#8217;t come soon. Tamara and I both know the situation, and how it makes the other person feel. Tamara&#8217;s card, despite being aimed at young children, made me cry.<br />
Breakfast followed, as did my traditional butt-whipping at video games. (Jen usually creams me on the game of choice.) By 15:00, it was time to head up to Nana&#8217;s. We had to prepare for dinner.<br />
When Nana had moved into her complex, she had immediately made arrangements for us to use the Family Dining Room for our great family feast. While all fine and dandy, this did pose a couple of logistical problems, most notably the cooking of the turkey. (In fact, this simple thing created what I can only describe as the first great family feud in my memory. In the end, Uncle David took over turkey preparation, while Mom and Brenda just fumed about the whole situation.) Seating arrangements weren&#8217;t too difficult to sort out.<br />
The feud did not continue when everyone arrived. Instead, we prepared dinner, with everyone chipping in for details (moving furniture, making parts of the meals, grabbing things from Nana&#8217;s room). By 17:45, we were all seated around the massive table, eating. It was the earliest I can ever remember having Christmas dinner.<br />
Following the meal, and before we all partook of dessert, Uncle David presented a slide show. They were old photos of the family from the 1940s and 1950s, when the &#8220;children&#8221; (namely, Mom, David, and Brenda) were still young. Some of the slides were creepy &#8212; there were two where we were all convinced the subject was Cathy, not Mom.<br />
By 21:00, the Family Dining Room looked like we hadn&#8217;t even been there. Everything was cleaned, packed up, and on its way back out to the cars. We grouped together in a room just off the lobby, overlooking the complex&#8217;s dining room, for a family photo. Darren, Jen, and I all took ones with our digital cameras. I wish I&#8217;d brought my larger one &#8212; it can handle the zoom a lot better than my small one.<br />
I was back at the gym bright and early the next morning. I had a very high calorie dinner to try and burn off. I didn&#8217;t get through a lot of it, because I had to be at Pam&#8217;s for 10:30 for brunch. It was the collection of families that had been at the Hovey&#8217;s two nights earlier (see [[It Just Doesn&#8217;t Feel Like Christmas Eve]]), just a different venue. Pam and crew had been preparing breakfast for some time. We mingled until the breakfast bell was rung, and it was time to eat. I have gotta get the recipe for Pam&#8217;s mediterranean breakfast dish. Very tasty.<br />
During breakfast, an idea crept through my little head. It&#8217;s Friday, and I want to go see a matinee. Specifically, &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221;. It dawned on me that Jen had probably not seen it. Sure enough, she hadn&#8217;t. I proposed a plan to relieve Mike and Brenda of their daughter for the afternoon, doing some shopping down at A&amp;B Sound (the two of us had gift certificates to take care of), and then see the movie. All parties were in favour.<br />
A&amp;B Sound was far from packed, but we&#8217;d also long-missed the door crasher specials they&#8217;d had when the doors opened at 7:00 that morning. Fortunately, the discounts on white- and red-tagged prices were still in effect. It also meant we could get through the store without constantly bumping into people, and not spend forever in the checkout line.<br />
Dumping our new-gotten goods in the car, we headed over to Eau Claire Market for the movie. Having a little time before the movie, we endulged in some games in the adjacent arcade. Either Jen was having an off day, or was being merciful. I won all three games of air hockey, a fighting game (Marvel vs. Capcom, if memory serves me right) that I had no idea how to play or what was going on, and a racing game that really wasn&#8217;t that good anyway. Jen still served me my heiny on a platter in Soul Caliber 2, though.<br />
Popcorn and pop in hand, we sat down for the movie. A long one, too. But an interesting one. Not everyone is a fan of Tom Cruise, but he does a very good job in this movie. The short explanation is that it&#8217;s about a civil war veteran who ends up in Japan during the Meiji Reformation to train Japan&#8217;s new army in modern weapons. He&#8217;s captured by the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a group of samurai) and learns about the way of the warrior &#8212; something he&#8217;d lost while fighting in America. Knowing something of Japanese history, it was quite interesting to see, and I wonder how accurate it might really be.<br />
Returning to the Znack&#8217;s, we had leftovers from last night&#8217;s dinner. Just not quite so much. I didn&#8217;t stay too late, though, as I had laundry to tackle &#8212; I&#8217;m running out of clean clothes.<br />
Besides, it gave me a great excuse to watch the movies I got for Christmas.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Tis the night before Christmas,<br />
and all through the house,<br />
the cat is sound sleeping,<br />
as I sit here with my mouse.<br />
No stockings are hung<br />
by a chimney with care,<br />
just thrown in the laundry bin<br />
&#8216;cuz I have more to wear<br />
No children are nestled<br />
all snug in their beds,<br />
The only visions I see<br />
are of oncoming dread.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already noticed, I&#8217;m a little down this Christmas. I mean, it&#8217;s Christmas Eve, and I&#8217;m sitting in front of my computer, wondering what all the hulabaloo is about. When I was a kid &#8212; heck, even two years ago (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]) &#8212; Christmas meant something. It was an occasion. As I sit here in front of my computer, it&#8217;s just a day, no different than any other.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas. Maybe because there was no lead-in, no real build-up. It&#8217;s just &#8220;here&#8221;. Sure, I went to the malls &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t have missed the Christmas decorations if you were Helen Keller. But that&#8217;s not Christmas to me. My mother is here, as is a large portion of my family. Cathy and Craig are back in Oakville, and my Aunt Ruth and cousins Erica and Lauren are in the Toronto area. But is it their presence I miss?<br />
Last year was my first Christmas in Calgary. I have family here &#8212; I didn&#8217;t really miss anything. But is it that? Is that what I am missing? Not just my family here &#8212; but *all* of my family? I don&#8217;t know. Sure, it&#8217;s the second Christmas in a row without Cathy. Without my immediate family. It&#8217;s also the second Christmas without Dad. No loud Christmas music, no massive amounts of decorations, none of the usual triggers one would expect for this season.<br />
At least, none for me. There are plenty of other people looking forward to tomorrow. But not me. It&#8217;s just another day, just one where I don&#8217;t have to work. I think, if anything, I&#8217;m a little depressed. It&#8217;s too easy to lose touch with the things you need or want. It&#8217;s not about possessions &#8212; it&#8217;s about feeling. And maybe this year, I&#8217;m not feeling up to snuff.<br />
Earlier this year, I started dating someone for the first time since arriving in Calgary. While we are no longer together (we are friends), that experience awoke a number of things within me that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. I suppose it&#8217;s wholly possible that some of these feelings are contributing to the problems I&#8217;m having. It could be that I&#8217;m incapable of enjoying Christmas this year because of that.<br />
But admittedly, I don&#8217;t really know. All I do know is that it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas to me. And I can only hope that the feeling is short-lived. I don&#8217;t want to go through the rest of my life feeling like this every December 25th.<br />
But don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t spend my time at home this evening. Tonight, we went out to visit with Aunt Alaine&#8217;s family, who are holding court out in Chestermere, about 20 kms east of Calgary along Hwy 16 (aka Trans Canada Highway). It&#8217;s a short drive, not far from my Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike&#8217;s &#8230; or would be, if we had proper directions.<br />
Getting to Chestermere is easy, don&#8217;t get me wrong. What&#8217;s not so easy? Finding the right house. Why is this so difficult? Because we neglected to get the address, or directions once inside Chestermere before we left the house. This left us circling the endless labyrinth of streets in a vain search for the Hovey residence.<br />
Jen and I got frustrated. While everyone else seemed content to say &#8220;Oh! *This* is the right street!&#8221;, we were content to grab the cell phone, call the house, and announce that we were lost and needed directions. (I was a bit snarky about it, too &#8212; probably a result of the aforementioned frustration.)<br />
Unlike previous excursions to the Hovey&#8217;s (at Easter &#8212; see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]], my family would not be the only ones in attendance. The Tisdales were already in attendance, as were the various relatives on Alaine&#8217;s side of the yard. Several &#8220;kids&#8221; (namely, those a lot younger than I). Luckily, I get along well with the rest of the adults.<br />
We left shortly after 22:00, returning to Calgary. After a brief stop at Brenda and Mike&#8217;s, I drove Mom and Nana to Nana&#8217;s complex, where I swapped the van for my car (left at the complex when we&#8217;d done a run up earlier in the day). In a few short hours, I will be back at Chez Znack for Christmas Day.<br />
Something that, for what seems to be the first time in my life, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>

		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, the Greedy Bastard hit Cowtown.<br />
The Bastard in question, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is Eric Idle. For those of you buried under rocks since the day of your birth, Eric was one of Britain&#8217;s Monty Python comedy troupe, makers of several years of quality British television and such movies as &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Life of Brian&#8221;, and &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s The Meaning of Life&#8221;.<br />
Eric is self-described as the sixth most friendly Python, after Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, and John Cleese. For those of you unawares, there are only six members of Monty Python. Having now met the man in person, he certainly is pleasant enough.<br />
Eric is the only current touring (former) member of Monty Python. John has a successful acting career (although Eric&#8217;s is fairly prolific), Michael has done several series for the BBC (a documentary-like version of &#8220;Around the World in 80 Days&#8221;), Terry Gilliam is one of Hollywood&#8217;s more ecclectic directors, and Terry Jones has done some bit parts and a few books (he co-authored &#8220;Starship Titanic&#8221; with &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; author Douglas Adams). Graham Chapman died in 1989.<br />
This time through North America (running October to the end of December), Eric&#8217;s running under the banner: &#8220;The Greedy Ba$tard Tour: Another Stupid Evening&#8230;&#8221;. For all those who think he&#8217;s doing it just for money, he&#8217;ll agree with you 100% of the way. As he started off when he came on stage: &#8220;This is to earn money so I can send my daughter through college &#8230; and my wife through collegen.&#8221;<br />
Tamara, Nick, and I went in a group of three, but weren&#8217;t the only Critical Mass folk out. Steve was there with his girlfriend, as was John with his. I can only assume there were others, but we never saw any of them. It was good to see that the three of us weren&#8217;t the only ones interested in a good laugh.<br />
We arrived at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Theatre (usually referred to as just &#8220;The Jubilee&#8221;) around 19:35, for a 20:00 show. Nick and I are Python fans &#8212; Nick even knows some of the The Rutles (Eric&#8217;s answer to The Beatles). Checking the coats (and stashing the camera), we headed in to find our seats.<br />
I&#8217;d never been to The Jubilee before. It&#8217;s not at all what I expected. It&#8217;s attached to the Alberta College of Art and Design (known more informally as ACAD), but does not look at all like a school auditorium. It&#8217;s a three-tiered honest-to-God theatre, regularly hosting operas and ballets. Tonight, it hosted an &#8220;adults-only&#8221; show. Some of Python&#8217;s material, and some of Eric&#8217;s comedy, is not for kids.<br />
The stage was simple: a small piano on the (audience&#8217;s) left side, and a coat rack, chair, guitar stand, and throw rug on the right. Music played softly as people entered the auditorium. With only minutes to the show, the music became louder, as The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; started playing. Several people in the audience did the motions in the chorus. Then one of the actors (it wasn&#8217;t Eric) walked out on stage as one of the Gumbys &#8212; a Python character known for abject stupidity. He attempted the chorus motions. The audience laughed.<br />
The music changed to the infamous &#8220;Spam&#8221; theme, sung by ancient Vikings. (Yep, another Python skit.) On came Eric, to a cacaphony of whistles, hollers, yells, screams, and a lot of clapping. After the crowd calmed down, he started into his routine, pausing only to introduce something never done before: the Encore Bucket.<br />
This was a shiny, stainless steel garbage can. It&#8217;s Eric&#8217;s way of ensuring that he comes on for an encore. The idea is that you throw money in there (or women&#8217;s underwear &#8212; he&#8217;s trying to break through the Tom Jones Barrier), and if there&#8217;s enough, he&#8217;ll do an encore. In reality, all money collected goes to charity (Eric keeps the underwear). So if you&#8217;re seeing Eric Idle&#8217;s Greedy Bastard Tour, bring a few extra bucks for charity.<br />
The only time he took a truly serious note was to mark that tonight is the second anniversary of George Harrison&#8217;s death. Harrison produced movies, and footed the entire bill for &#8220;Life of Brian&#8221;. As Eric put it: &#8220;The most expensive movie ticket, ever!&#8221; Eric and George had been good friends for many years.<br />
As Eric&#8217;s opening dialogue went on, he explained that he had been to The Jubilee before &#8212; 30 years ago, with the rest of Monty Python, on the first (and last) tour of Canada. Eric has been through Canada a couple of times since (his previous tour was &#8220;Eric Idle Exploits Monty Python&#8221;). On his last tour, he was presented with none other than the Monty Python hook, a very long, crooked pole used to drag people offstage in their skits. The group had left it behind in Vancouver at the end of their tour 30 years ago, and Eric was presented it when he returned a couple of years ago.<br />
As he said: &#8220;I can only imagine what this would fetch on eBay!&#8221;<br />
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical as to the content of the show. I mean, I like Monty Python a lot, but would the show really be anything original? It was just Eric, and there&#8217;s no telling if the rest of the players would have the same comedic timing of Python. I was quite happily relieved to find that Eric&#8217;s happy band of six people (including himself) were quite up to the task. And even after many shows, his co-players can still crack up on stage.<br />
We were treated to many classic Python songs, including &#8220;The Penis Song&#8221;, &#8220;The Philosopher&#8217;s Song&#8221;, &#8220;Sit On My Face&#8221;, &#8220;Eric The Half-A-Bee&#8221;, &#8220;I Like Chinese&#8221;, &#8220;Galaxy Song&#8221;, and of course, the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221;. We hoped for &#8220;Every Sperm Is Sacred&#8221;, but not that night. (Tamara had never heard the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221; before, but had it stuck in her head from the moment she heard it until well after we were home.)<br />
The tickets weren&#8217;t cheap ($55), but it was worth every penny. The show was funny, and even localized. (They rewrote the &#8220;Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge&#8221; skit so that the wife was from Okotoks &#8212; something we found extremely funny, because Tamara&#8217;s from Okotoks.) They included some Canadian humour, including ye olde poke fun at Americans.<br />
Two and a half hours after the show started, it was over. Nick and I ran into the autograph line so we could get things signed. We had hoped for the DVDs we had brought, but a sign read: &#8220;The Greedy Bastard will only sign purchased merchandise&#8221;. Thirty dollars later, I have a signed t-shirt. Hey, I might never get another chance to meet a Python.<br />
I did get a chance to speak to Eric. I thanked him for coming to Calgary, and hoped he would return again. He looked quite tired (the show takes a lot out of you when you&#8217;re 62 years young), but was still the quintessential showman.<br />
Even for a self-proclaimed Bastard.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Friday night was not fun. Erin and I got together after work, headed down to her place to eat pizza and watch Indiana Jones movies. Or at least that was the plan. We watched the second half of &#8220;Last Crusade&#8221; (having started it a couple nights earlier), and had a great time. But as we started to watch &#8220;Temple of Doom&#8221;, things turned a slightly darker note.<br />
We&#8217;d been discussing why I *hate* dancing. (It&#8217;s a long, sordid story that I&#8217;m not going to detail here.) Erin wanted to know why, but I didn&#8217;t want to tell her. She kept at it, repeatedly demanding to know. Suddenly, I found myself blasted four years into the past, and it wasn&#8217;t Erin who was asking me, it was Allison.<br />
All the dread, fear, anguish, and pain that I had thought long gone washed over me like an oil spill washing up on a rocky shore. I felt completely helpless. For almost a half hour, I was unable to do or say anything. Erin was beside herself &#8212; she had no idea what to do. She&#8217;d never seen this sort of thing before, and didn&#8217;t know how to handle it. Not that I could blame her.<br />
It&#8217;s a test. Not an intentional one, I have to say, but it is a test nonetheless. A test of how we deal with problems when they arise, and a test of how I&#8217;m able to adjust having someone else in my life again. Had this happened on my own, I&#8217;d probably have just gone for a walk, watched a movie, played a game, something to dull the mind. But not anymore, now I need to work it through. It&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; I&#8217;ve let these old issues sit far too long.<br />
Saturday got off to a slow start. I didn&#8217;t sleep well at all. I ached all over, and memories of the night before were still far too fresh in my mind. But I looked at the day with fresher eyes &#8212; I wanted to have a good day.<br />
Erin and I met up with her parents and Aunt Edie at Joey Tomato&#8217;s at Chinook a few minutes before noon. Erin&#8217;s father was parading around in shorts, despite the fact that the outside temperature was barely 10 degrees. (Later, I would agree with the choice of attire, since the temperature would rise throughout the day.)<br />
Lunch was excellent, of course, though a little quieter than some of the meals I&#8217;ve had with Erin&#8217;s family. Well, quiet except when Erin&#8217;s dad was prodding me to rib Erin a little bit. Not that it takes much to get me to do it, I&#8217;m nearly convinced Erin&#8217;s dad loves it when I&#8217;m the antagonist.<br />
After lunch, Erin, her mom, and her aunt went shopping. Erin&#8217;s dad and I sauntered across Macleod to the Staples. Erin&#8217;s dad wanted my opinion on a scanner he had put on hold. This was the first time I&#8217;d been left alone with Erin&#8217;s father. It&#8217;s probably the single most nerve-wracking thing for a guy to go through. Erin had already been left alone with my aunt, grandmother, and cousins, so it was only fair (certainly to a point) that I spend some time with just her father, even if under the pretenses of assisting in buying a scanner.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen the Canon LiDE 80 before &#8212; it&#8217;s a new one to me. (Not that I&#8217;ve researched scanners for a while.) But it&#8217;s small, light, powered through the USB port, and comes with a negative scanning adapter (definitely a useful tool). I want one. I haven&#8217;t had a scanner in almost four years, and I have to say, I need one badly. I&#8217;ve got a huge pile of photographs and negatives just calling out to be scanned. I just don&#8217;t have $250 laying around to be used.<br />
Oh well, things to plan for.<br />
Dropping the scanner off in the car, Erin&#8217;s dad and I retreated to Chapters to wait for Erin, her mom, and her aunt. We shared a hot chocolate and cranberry juice, chatted, and waited. Didn&#8217;t take too long before we were all reunited. The reunion was short, as Erin&#8217;s parents and aunt had other things to do.<br />
Erin and I took off to 17th Ave. This is one of Calgary&#8217;s prime shopping areas. It&#8217;s also home to Erin&#8217;s favourite store: I-Appeal. If Erin had the chance, she&#8217;d probably buy everything in the store to decorate her condo. But she had a limit of $20, keeping her to just two &#8220;decorative&#8221; elves. (I think they&#8217;re kinda creepily ugly, personally, but Erin thinks they&#8217;re the bees knees.)<br />
Plans that evening were to attend a long-delayed housewarming for Fritz and Jin. This, of course, means I needed to bring a suitable housewarming gift. For some reason, I&#8217;m a big fan of glass flower vases &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why. As Fritz is a Designer (and certainly Jin is quite stylish), I needed something that would be suitable. Luckily, I-Appeal had just what I was looking for.<br />
After a quick stop at Blockbuster (gift certificates), it was into Reid&#8217;s for some wrapping paper. We then wandered over to 8th St. to stop into Janice Beaton. It had been far too long since my last high-quality cheese fix. I tried to convince Erin that she needed to try some, but it seems there&#8217;s desire for cheese &#8212; and then there&#8217;s me. (I did manage to convince her a little later.) Of course, we had to stop in Bernard Callebaut (it&#8217;s almost impossible to pass it by) for a couple bites. A short stop at the house (to drop off the cheese and wrap the present), and we were off to Fritz and Jin&#8217;s.<br />
Fritz and Jin moved into their condo in July (see [[Painting my house (among other things)]]), after waiting another year following their condo burning down (luckily, they hadn&#8217;t been living there at the time) in a collosal fire. Although housewarmings usually take place not long after moving in, Fritz and Jin had some things they had to attend to, first. So, almost three months later, they finally got to have their party.<br />
Well, the first of a couple, anyway. They&#8217;ve got co-workers and Jin&#8217;s friends to deal with, as well.<br />
Erin and I were the first to arrive. No big surprise there &#8212; our group of friends aren&#8217;t exactly the most punctual kind. It gave us time to chat with Fritz and Jin until the others started to appear. Doug, Jensenne and Jon, Virgil, Jon and Pearl, and Teak and Rose soon rounded out our little group. With the tour of the condo out of the way, we proceeded to scatter about the kitchen/dining/living space and chat.<br />
Some of us hadn&#8217;t seen the others in quite some time. For example, I can&#8217;t really remember the last time I saw Jon and Pearl, but it had been quite a while. It was there that we found out for the first time that they&#8217;re getting engaged &#8212; they just have to wait for the ring. Good news, indeed.<br />
Food was plentiful, if perhaps on the not-quite-so nutritious side &#8212; Asian snack foods. Tasty, but not exactly wholesome. Real food came in the form of pizza, which Fritz and Doug went to pick up.<br />
This group is loosely known as the ABCs &#8212; the Asian Brother Crew. This is Chris&#8217; name for the lot of us. The only missing members were Calvin (MIA, near as we could tell), Chris (still in Japan), Adrian (in Japan, visiting Chris), and Tamara (who, sadly, forgot). As it had been a very long time since the last time together, we marked the occasion with a photograph.<br />
The evening would not end there, however. One thing we particularly like doing is bowl. Yeah, kinda hokey, I know, but it&#8217;s fun. Especially when we&#8217;re making fun of the way we play. So we all raced up to Let&#8217;s Bowl in the Northeast &#8212; our favourite lane. As it was 21:30 when we arrived, we figured on a decent amount of time to play. Or so we thought.<br />
An hour and a half wait. For all the times we&#8217;d been there before, we&#8217;d *never* seen a wait that long. And we weren&#8217;t about to wait. A hurried conversation of where to go next drummed up Pacific Place (formerly known as Franklin Mall), which had bowling lanes. Best part was, it was only a few minutes drive away.<br />
Erin and I initially lost everyone else. They&#8217;d gone around front, where they couldn&#8217;t get into the bowling alley. Erin and I went around back (actually by mistake). A few cell phone calls later, and everyone was assembled to play. Our hopes were initially dashed a wee bit when we realized it was five pin bowling instead of the usual 10-pin. It had been a long time since the last time I&#8217;d bowled five pin (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and I was kind of looking forward to it.<br />
And as it was Erin&#8217;s first time bowling in 14 years, I think she was looking forward to it, too.<br />
I won&#8217;t recount the games &#8212; there&#8217;s no point. Erin did far better than she thought she would (I&#8217;m sure). I bowled okay, though I kept shooting to the left, for some reason. And right after we noticed that the display not only showed the score but also how fast the ball was moving, a few of us tried to get the fastest throw. Fritz won with 43.5 km/h. (I could only do 42.3 km/h.)<br />
The game, and the party, broke up after that. Most of us were tired &#8212; it had been a long day for all. (Especially Teak, who&#8217;d played two back-to-back games of street hockey before coming to the party.)<br />
Can&#8217;t wait until someone else buys a home.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not every day that you turn 30. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s long since been my turn.<br />
This time, it was for my friend Teak. You may remember Teak from a previous birthday of his, when Chris and I felt the need for a little revenge (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). Having no reason to torture my friend, I felt it necessary to show my support for a fellow over-the-hiller.<br />
Teak had reserved the upper floor of Soho, one of the trendier bars in town. Why the upper floor? Teak knows how to throw a party &#8212; he invited 250 people. Now the first rule of parties is to always invite a lot more people than you expect to show up, because about half won&#8217;t come. Teak planned for that, and the upmost floor was ideally suited for 100-130 people.<br />
Tamara, Sheldon (Tamara&#8217;s new boyfriend), and I headed out shortly before 19:30 to rendezvous with the gathering throng at Soho. We were among the first to arrive. Such is the norm, really &#8212; most people seem to like doing what they did in high school, and be fashionably late.<br />
In our haste to leave the house, I realized (much to my chagrin) that I&#8217;d forgotten my camera. I had only recently got it back from Adrian, who had taken it on his whirlwind trip to Japan and the Philippines. I wanted to take photos at Teak&#8217;s birthday &#8212; mostly for Chris, who&#8217;s still trapped in Japan.<br />
Soon, members of the ABC (Asian Brother Crew) started to appear. Fritz and Jin were the first (after Tamara and I), followed soon after by Adrian. Doug appeared not too long after. A few others from Critical Mass (Karen, Mark G., Mark E.) also arrived, as did Arif (arriving with Teak&#8217;s girlfriend Rose), Arthur (with friend Tanya), and former teammate Bonnie (with partner Mandy). We were outnumbered, however, by the rest of Teak&#8217;s friends, a few of whom I vaguely knew.<br />
Tamara and Sheldon didn&#8217;t stay too long before leaving. They didn&#8217;t quite feel like they fit in. (And I did?) I hung out for a while with the ABCs, talked with Bonnie and Mandy for a long time, and then had a long chat with Arthur and Tanya. I couldn&#8217;t stay too long, as my stamina isn&#8217;t quite what it usually is. But without knowing it, I&#8217;d lasted until after midnight.<br />
Arriving home, I flopped on the couch to peruse the late night Saturday television lineup. But once Miao Yin had made herself comfortable in my lap, staying awake just wasn&#8217;t a possibility. I passed out. Explains the kink in my neck.<br />
I&#8217;m getting too old for this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have learned from my jaunt out on Thursday night (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]). I guess I did to a point, but I made one key error: I went out to celebrate Jim&#8217;s birthday.<br />
For the record, Jim&#8217;s a great guy. He&#8217;s a lot of fun &#8212; he has no inhibitions to speak of, he lives more on the edge than most (especially when it comes to skiing), and lives for the moment. He&#8217;s a great web developer, he&#8217;s inquisitive, and is always interested in pushing the boundaries of website development. Unlike most people, Jim doesn&#8217;t really have a shell to come out of &#8212; he wears pretty much all his internal organs on his sleeves.<br />
What&#8217;s all this mean? Well, when you receive an invitation from Jim, asking you to attend an evening of drinking, you can immediately know where it&#8217;ll likely head. The fact that today is Jim&#8217;s 26th birthday made events of last night all the more &#8230; necessary.<br />
I arrived at Jim&#8217;s apartment (a two-minute walk from the venerable Rose &amp; Crown pub) shortly after 20:00, the approximate time we were asked to arrive. Upon entering the apartment to the loud calls of Scott (who&#8217;d arrived mere moments before me), James (already quite well into the bag), and two of Jim&#8217;s friends (whose names I&#8217;m drawing a blank on), I was informed of the house rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No smoking inside. (No worries there.)</li>
<li>No throwing large objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, there were no other rules. But there was a bit of preparation.<br />
As each person arrived, they had to roll dice. For most people, it was three. Women only had to roll two. Mia and Lindsay got away with only one &#8212; Mia was on antibiotics, so was taking a (wisely) careful approach. The number you rolled were the number of drinks you had to have before the night was over. The rules (as stated by Jim) meant that all ones were actually sevens. Thusly, the drink minimum was six, and the maximum was 21. Jim (and Luke, the co-birthday boy) each had to drink 26, because that&#8217;s their new age.<br />
I rolled a 17. Figures. James rolled a 20. He finished even before we left for the Rose &amp; Crown.<br />
To ensure that everyone had their share, you strung the number of candies (taken from a candy necklace) onto a piece of dental floss, which you wore around your necklace. For each drink you finished, you ate one of the candies. Beers and shots counted as one. For pints, it was in groups of three: first pint was a single drink, the next two were two drinks each, for a total of five.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if anyone every really put that rule to the test.<br />
With most of the group assembled around 23:30, we departed for the Rose &amp; Crown (Mia and Lindsay had come and gone by that time). It was cold, but the alcohol kept us (somewhat) warm. Luke bypassed the pub, saying he needed food. He never came back. We kept going at the Rose &amp; Crown, talking drinking, and eating nachos until &#8230; well, until you couldn&#8217;t hang out any longer.<br />
I stopped around 1:30 or so. I was out of money (I had budgeted myself as a limiting device) and feeling kinda tired. I also didn&#8217;t want to relive Friday when I woke up later this morning. So it was off towards home, stopping at Canadian Pizza Unlimited for a little repast, and at the Mac&#8217;s to pick up a litre of Gatorade and a small bag of chips. (Gatorade restores the salts, etc. your body loses while drinking.)<br />
Falling asleep on the couch, I awoke only when Tamara came crashing through the door around 4:00. I don&#8217;t wholly remember her return. I just rolled over and went back to sleep. I haven&#8217;t slept that well in a long time.<br />
Aside from being really tired, I had a much better day than on Friday. Oddly enough, it felt really good to just laze around for a change. It&#8217;s been a while since I outright relaxed. I can only imagine what kind of a day Jim must&#8217;ve had. But something tells me that he wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was not so great &#8212; he almost certainly had a great time last night.<br />
As for me, I think I&#8217;m going to remain sober for a while yet to come. Two nights of debauchery in such close proximity isn&#8217;t good for me. I might begin to like it.<br />
Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t finish the 17. I might have actually had 13 drinks, including shots. Even then, I&#8217;m not too sure. It was probably less &#8212; I cheated a couple of times.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of smart things one can do on a school night. Getting drunk ain&#8217;t one of them.<br />
For those of you no longer in the scholastic world, a &#8220;school night&#8221; is no different than those you experienced at school. Basically, most weekday nights (not counting Friday) and Sunday night. So named because you have to get up early in the morning, file yourself off to a building, and concentrate on things that you might not otherwise like doing.<br />
For the last three days, I&#8217;ve been in all-day meetings. We&#8217;re planning out the 2004 projects for Mercedes-Benz. Now that I&#8217;m part of the lead team, I now participate in these meetings. They&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. We sort out all sorts of issues and really get a good feel for the direction we want to take the account.<br />
But they are draining.<br />
It&#8217;s like having a Martian Brain Sucker attached to your skull all day. By the end of it, you&#8217;re exhausted. The advantage is that you feel really good about the work you&#8217;ve done. All in in all, it&#8217;s a good experience.<br />
&#8216;Course, the best part is the dinner that follow the last day. That&#8217;s when the MB team goes out for dinner. Well, &#8220;dinner&#8221; is a subjective term, since we eat a little and drink a lot. (The amount of drinking varies, usually inversely proportionate to how smart you are about when to stop.) But it&#8217;s all fun.<br />
To make things more interesting, I didn&#8217;t leave right at the end of the day. You see, irony of ironies, the site that I worked on directly (and for which we were having the dinner), MBUSA.com, was down. It had been down since about 11:00 that morning. All because of a database edit. A fairly simple thing, really, which is why we were so utterly puzzled when the &#8220;fix&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.<br />
When 17:00 rolled around, the fixing was still at full speed. I got the skinny on what was going on (I only knew during the day that there was a problem, but not exactly what it was) and tried to understand what part of the problem was. (There was a lot of Java discussion, which I don&#8217;t possess enough of an understanding to truly grasp.) In a nutshell, there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to help.<br />
So I went out to get drunk.<br />
Well, that wasn&#8217;t so much the intention so much as the result. And lest ye be thinking I&#8217;m turning into a raging alcoholic, please rest your fears. Now I know there are a number of stories that always seem to start: &#8220;So we went out to get drunk&#8230;&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I don&#8217;t live my entire week like that &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have made it 31 years if I did. Just that the drinking stories are usually the most fun.<br />
The Wildwood Pub is one of the nicer places in town to meet. It used to be a lot better. Sadly, as I found out last night, their beer quality has begun to sink dramatically. Peter, our newest copywriter, was telling me to avoid the stuff. I should have listened. Between Peter and myself, we tried every variety of beer they had (there&#8217;s only six or seven of &#8217;em). They were all bad. We both switched to Keith&#8217;s.<br />
I think I ended up being the only technology person in attendance. (Most of the others, sadly, were trapped at the office trying to resolve the site problem. The fix, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was to restore a previous backup of the database.) So I guess I felt a responsibility to represent. [Insert cliched reference to LA gangland-style comrades here.]<br />
That might have been what possessed me to drink beer a little too quickly. Either way, a good time was had. So good, in fact, that eventually, it was down to just five people: Dan (the Managing Director &#8212; the Big Kahuna, if you will), Mabel (Dan&#8217;s assistant), Jason (Project Manager), Daryl (Account Manager), and yours truly. That was when Mabel convinced us that we had to go somewhere else.<br />
We retreated to two cars: Mabel&#8217;s and Dan&#8217;s. I rode in Dan&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d never been in a Mercedes-Benz before. (Hey, he *is* the Managing Director. He kind of has to own one.) It&#8217;s nice &#8230; the rear seats are brutally cold, but it is nice. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever own one, though.<br />
Mabel and Dan zig-zagged through Calgary. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I knew where they were going, but we eventually ended up at Mabel&#8217;s apartment, where she ditched her car. The five of us continued in Dan&#8217;s to our destination: Aussie Rules.<br />
Aussie Rules is an Australian bar. (Or at least, it&#8217;s supposed to be.) Now before you think that&#8217;s a little strange, here&#8217;s something else to make you scratch your head: It ain&#8217;t the only one in town. Yes, there is another one: The Flying Emu (okay, so technically, it should be a New Zealand bar), just down from my old apartment.<br />
So you think I&#8217;d see kangaroos, drink Foster&#8217;s, and eat barbecued shrimp, right? Nope. We listened to dueling pianos.<br />
Yes, dueling pianos. Perhaps one of the stranger things to see in a bar. Two pianos (baby grands), facing each other. Two player/singers. But it&#8217;s not a competition &#8212; they play together, banging out whatever songs people request (or whatever they feel like playing). Mabel led us to the table right in front of the stage so we could get the full effect.<br />
We came at an opportune time (which I can only assume was in the vicinity of midnight), as these guys had been playing (and drinking) for a couple of hours. They were definitely well into their silly stage. While they did play great music (they actually did a couple lines out of Gowan&#8217;s &#8220;A Criminal Mind&#8221; on a request I shouted out; they wouldn&#8217;t touch Gordon Lightfoot), they also did a pub favourite. This was Mabel&#8217;s request.<br />
At some point in your life, you&#8217;ve probably heard The Irish Rover&#8217;s &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;. If you listen to it the way the Rovers do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is a very nice song. If you listen to the way the Dueling Pianos do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is an Olympic event.<br />
When the request was made, one of the two pianists (a guy about 40 lbs overweight, I&#8217;d guess) climbed up on top of the piano (I assume it can easily handle the weight of someone on the lid), picked up a microphone, and hopped over to the top of the other piano, and prompted demanded everyone stand up.<br />
Incidentally, I assume they&#8217;ll only do this song after people have been drinking long enough.<br />
So here&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s all about a couple of the verses (here&#8217;s a link, <a href="http://www.irish-rovers.demon.co.uk/lyrics/unicorn.htm">in case you want to know what the lyrics actually are</a>), repeating the chorus often, making the audience mimic the animals mentioned in the chorus, and following the direction of the singer (for example, when he yells: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221;, you point at the bar). If you manage to get to the end with all the motions without laughing yourself to the floor, you&#8217;ve done pretty well.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it. But I didn&#8217;t land on the floor.<br />
Anyway, without going into excrutiating detail (&#8216;cuz you know I could), we had a blast at Aussie Rules. Before we knew it, there was the Last Call. At the time, it didn&#8217;t really click with me what the time probably was. For some reason, I decided that whatever time it was, it wasn&#8217;t really that late. It didn&#8217;t feel that late.<br />
Time flies when you&#8217;re drunk.<br />
We upped and left (paying the bill, of course) and headed towards downtown, dropping Mabel off along the way. Then it was over to the Mercury, another Calgary establishment. I have no idea what time it was when we arrived. It couldn&#8217;t have been too late &#8212; the place was still serving. Dan decided we needed some Irish Whisky to finish off the night.<br />
Dan drove us home. I live somewhat close to Dan, but saved him the trip through Sunnyside by having him drop me off at 2nd Ave and Centre St. From there, it&#8217;s a 20 minute walk home, which I really needed. It gave me enough fresh air to remember to drink a couple glasses of water and take a couple Tylenol to stave off the inevitable hangover.<br />
Tamara had been home barely 30 minutes before I walked in. She laughed. I was a wreck, and she knew it. (Technically, I knew it too, but just wasn&#8217;t willing to acknowledge it.) I had the water, pills, quick run through the bathroom, and crawled into bed somewhere around 3:00.<br />
Well, I assume I crawled into bed. I don&#8217;t really remember that step, but since I woke up in there, that&#8217;s about as close an assumption as I can make. My alarm &#8212; Chris&#8217; stereo which clicks on at 5:20 playing the Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; album (the entire thing &#8212; that&#8217;s over 45 minutes long) &#8212; didn&#8217;t wake me up. Not even remotely. I forgot to set my secondary alarm. Luckily, I have a backup.<br />
It&#8217;s furry, has four feet, and purrs. She also meows really loudly in the morning when she wants to be fed.<br />
At 7:37, I bolted out of bed in a bit of a panic, threw my head under the tap to get the bedhead down, dressed, shaved very quickly, ran a toothbrush across my teeth, and was in the process of about to run out the door when I realized Tamara was still asleep. We carpooled. I don&#8217;t drive to work usually, but considering we had to be at work for 8:00, I made an exception.<br />
The hangover kicked in around 8:30. And it got progressively worse all morning. The more I moved, the worse it got. Fortunately, nothing so serious that I was ready to &#8230; well, y&#8217;know, but I sucked back a few aspirin with ginger ale to try quieten the body. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a greasy lunch at A&amp;W that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Well, as normal as anyone can feel after mimicking a chimpanzee in a Australian bar in suburban Calgary at some ungodly hour of the night because I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for my own good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. And it&#8217;s not even Hallowe&#8217;en yet.<br />
Starting early this week, the weather folk started telling us to prepare for Calgary&#8217;s first snowstorm of the season. This is something we&#8217;ve heard a couple of times before &#8212; some of you might have heard about this &#8220;big dump&#8221; we were supposed to get back in September (we had, at most, a light dusting).<br />
This time, though, they weren&#8217;t wrong. Tuesday, it started raining. And the temperature fell all day. By 20:00, it was snowing. Only colder things (e.g. cars and benches) were gathering an accumulation. Everywhere else it was melting away. I walked home from downtown &#8212; by the time I got there, it was clear that this wasn&#8217;t going to be a simple dusting.<br />
The temperature dropped overnight, and the snow fell harder. By morning, there was at least four inches of snow on my front walk. I debated for a moment on either shovelling before the gym, or dealing with the aftermath when I got home. I chose the latter, mostly because I wanted to get to the gym, and my snow shovel was in the garage.<br />
Before I left, I realized that I would not be able to wear my shoes outside. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve worn running shoes &#8212; the same ones I would wear to work any other given day. Sounds a little chilly, I know, but because I&#8217;m always moving, it&#8217;s never been a problem. But my current choice of footwear was definitely not suited to winter weather.<br />
Thus, I hauled out my pair of winter boots. They had not seen outdoors in over six years. The last time I&#8217;d worn them was when I worked in downtown Toronto. I had to don a second pair of socks (wool ones), as the rubbing of the leather would probably wreak havoc on my poor feet. These boots have massive grip &#8230; on anything that&#8217;s not ice (as I found out this morning when my heel got a little too far ahead of me, and I found myself sitting in the middle of Centre Street).<br />
None of the roads had been ploughed, and only one short segment of the sidewalks in my area had been shovelled (the guy gets up even earlier than I do). Memorial Drive was a mess, as the night time traffic wasn&#8217;t frequent enough to clear the road. Fortunately, the city Peanut Pusher had cleaned off part of the pathway, giving me an easier walk to the Prince&#8217;s Island Park footbridge. The bridge was a little difficult, and the snow was still deep on the other side. I was a couple minutes late getting to the gym.<br />
The snow was still falling heavily when I left the gym over an hour later. The walk to work wasn&#8217;t easy. Although more sidewalks were now clear, they were also quite slippery. (Most hadn&#8217;t put down any salt.) I was about five minutes late getting to work.<br />
Some people were almost two hours late. And people wonder why I live in the inner city&#8230;<br />
It snowed most of the day. It was still snowing when I went home and shovelled the snow from my walkway and sidewalk. (On the bright side, the thick layer of snow obscures the scar where the sewer was replaced &#8212; see 24 September 2003.)<br />
The snow had stopped by this morning. But it was -12 when I left the house for the gym. Minus 12. It&#8217;s not even November yet. The windchill was double that. So say that this is not exactly expected (or desired) is to put it mildly.<br />
And, of course, tomorrow is Hallowe&#8217;en. The forecast is for at least -7, if not colder. You won&#8217;t be seeing any ballerinas, elves, or fairies tomorrow night. This years&#8217; hot costume in Calgary? Inuit.<br />
Snow is forecast for a few days yet to come. We won&#8217;t see above-zero temperatures for at least a week, by the looks of it. This is definitely one of the weirdest autumns I&#8217;ve yet experienced.<br />
I&#8217;m not ready to go walking in a mid-fall (hence, not-quite-winter) wonderland.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I love seeing old friends. I just hate seeing them leave.<br />
Therese was in town this weekend. Not really to visit with people so much (though that was one thing she did), but to defend her dissertation &#8212; the last step in obtaining her PhD. It&#8217;s the end of a very long road for Therese, something she&#8217;s been working hard to complete for over a third of her life.<br />
The defence was on Thursday afternoon. I had vowed to leave her be until then, since I knew that she&#8217;d be in preparations until then. We ended up talking for a while Wednesday afternoon &#8212; Therese called me while she took a little break. I&#8217;m not sure if she called so much for a social conversation, or looking for affirmation. As Therese would explain to me, graduate students often have low self-worth, having been told time and time again their work isn&#8217;t good enough. Luckily, it didn&#8217;t take much to instill faith in her knowledge and wisdom.<br />
Either that, or she was gullible enough to believe me.<br />
Therese&#8217;s defence began at 14:00 Thursday afternoon. Exactly what happened in there, I will never know. (Not that it&#8217;s really any of my business, anyway.) The defence was supposed to last about two hours, after which, Therese would receive her final grade. It&#8217;s a three-point score. If you get a &#8216;1&#8217;, you get champagne. If you get a &#8216;2&#8217;, you get a congratulations. If you don&#8217;t get either, you get to do it over again. Therese would find out around 16:30 what that score was. Ideally, that&#8217;s when I would find out if I had to start calling her &#8220;Doc&#8221;.<br />
16:00 came and went without any news. I called around 16:45, in hopes of catching her before something happened (we were supposed to get together that evening). I ended up at home around 17:45 without so much as a peep. I called again, and caught Therese in the midst of something very loud. I didn&#8217;t ask if she passed. I didn&#8217;t have to. I knew.<br />
&#8220;So, can I call you &#8216;Doc&#8217; now?&#8221;<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present the new Dr. Therese Hollingsworth. (Feels kinda weird to be writing that, I have to say.)<br />
The plan was to meet at Catch at 19:15 (the first time they had a table for five) and celebrate. (Besides, Therese had $50 in gift certificates to spend.) Therese drove over with her friend Joe, Geoff and Deanna would meet us there later. When I arrived, I found Therese alone at the table. It had only been a month and a half since I&#8217;d last seen her, but it felt like a lifetime.<br />
What made it more poignant was that this was a different Therese. This wasn&#8217;t the Therese I had come to know over the last decade. This Therese was happy, relaxed, and for the first time in her life, free of school. And just to complicate things even more (as if finishing her doctorate, moving to Montreal, and buying a home weren&#8217;t enough), Therese is three months&#8217; pregnant. In a few short months, two of my best and closest friends will be parents.<br />
I suddenly feel about 10 years older. (That&#8217;s 28 for those of you keeping count.) I&#8217;m not ready for this level of maturity. I&#8217;m too young for this.<br />
We ate a wonderful dinner and celebrated Therese&#8217;s success. The conversation around dinner naturally stemmed towards Therese&#8217;s pregnancy, sprinkled every so often with the defence and how it had gone and what Therese was going to do with her post-doctorate in Montreal. Life, it seems, rarely stays in place.<br />
I drove Therese to Stefanie&#8217;s that night, where Therese would stay until she leaves for Montreal this afternoon. But this wasn&#8217;t goodbye yet &#8212; there was still much to do. And Friday night would be such an event.<br />
Geoff (I should point out that I&#8217;m not talking about myself in the third person &#8212; this is *another* Geoff) booked the private room at the Blind Monk for Therese&#8217;s &#8220;reception&#8221;. So, after work, Erin and I headed down (after making a quick pit stop at Bernard Callebaut &#8212; Stuart had asked me to pick up some chocolates for Therese), where Therese got to meet Erin for the first time.<br />
The evening was long &#8212; running from about 19:00 to just after midnight. For us, it was tiring. For Therese, it was a marathon. Being on Eastern time, still exhausted from the defence, and pregnancy don&#8217;t really help one&#8217;s stamina. But Therese was among the last to leave.<br />
The next day, later in the afternoon, I picked up Geoff and Therese from the university to go shopping at Chinook. Therese and Geoff were going to visit Jeanine, Dory, and their new baby in Innisfail the next day, and weren&#8217;t about to go up empty-handed. Baby clothes and toys were the order of the day. I even threw in a small blanket with a bunny head sewn in the middle. (It sounds rather morbid, but it is cute.)<br />
Geoff left early, as Therese and I finished shopping. First to Willow Park for wine &#8212; a thank you gift for Therese&#8217;s advisors. Then it was to PetSmart to obtain a gift for Stefanie and Ian, who had put Therese up for a few days. Then it was the long drive back to Stefanie&#8217;s (not counting a side trip for a quick snack). Therese and I talked the whole way. I knew this would be the last time I&#8217;d see Therese for a while.<br />
Leaving her was difficult. I didn&#8217;t see Therese (or Stuart, for that matter) as much as I would have liked while she lived in Calgary. Now she&#8217;s 3,000 kilometres away, and three months&#8217; pregnant. I&#8217;ll not be seeing her again until after her child is born. We both found it hard to left go. Luckily, the dark streets were empty as I drove down the street. I could barely see the road through the tears.<br />
My weekend did not end there, though. Sunday brought around another first for Erin &#8212; not only had she met one of my closest friends (she had met Stuart when he had come out a month ago to ship out the contents of their house), but now she was going to meet my family.<br />
Well, &#8220;clan&#8221;, I guess. Since Mom, Cathy, and Craig live back in Ontario, Erin won&#8217;t meet them until Christmas (or so). But this was a chance for her to meet my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, cousins Jen, Pam, and Darren, Sean (Pam&#8217;s boyfriend), and of course, Nana.<br />
Needless to say, Erin was a little nervous.<br />
Actually, even *I* was a little nervous. I mean, they&#8217;re my family and I love them to death, but it&#8217;s hard to know how things will go. It&#8217;s not that I planned on disaster or anything (I wouldn&#8217;t have brought Erin if I didn&#8217;t think things would go well), but you never really know how well things will go until they happen. Besides, strange things always seem to happen when we go over there for dinner.<br />
Example: Mike announced that he had to pack up three bags of crabs for a co-worker. This suddenly conjured images of three large bags of Snow or Alaskan King, making me wonder what bet Mike had lost. I wasn&#8217;t the only one with this thought, and we soon found out that he had meant crabapples, not seafood. A co-worker wanted to make crabapple jelly. This led Mike, Jen, Sean, Darren, and I outside and quite literally up a tree.<br />
Sadly, many of the apples were going soft (some were outright rotten), but there were still many to be had. The tricky part, though, is getting them off the tree. Rotten apples are a breeze &#8212; just shake the branch. The good ones have a much stronger grip, and have to be picked by hand. Darren climbed a latter. Mike hopped on the fence. I went up the tree itself. (And have all the scratches to prove it.) It must&#8217;ve been quite the sight to see all of us in the denuded tree. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find out when Brenda gets her photos developed.<br />
Dinner, as expected, was outstanding. The food was excellent, and the conversation well matched the repast. But dinner was cut a little short. It seemed Darren and Sean were harbouring a virus, which showed through soon after the meal was complete &#8212; they were fading fast. Dinner was over by 20:00. A little unusual for my family, but not unwelcome &#8212; it gave us plenty of time to drive Nana home, me to drop of Erin (who lives in the deep south of Calgary), and be home in time to get my butt up for gym in the morning.<br />
I now sit, staring out my window, half wishing I could see planes taking off from the airport. I&#8217;d wave to them, knowing eventually Therese&#8217;s plane would be passing over. Instead, I have to wave at the crackheads and hookers who love hanging out in our area.<br />
Have a safe flight, dear friend. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be too long &#8217;til when next we meet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In years previous, I&#8217;ve spent Thanksgiving with my family. This year, however, I spent it with Erin&#8217;s.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t a spur-of-the-moment thing. In fact, this was loosely planned from the last (and first) time I&#8217;d met Erin&#8217;s parents (see [[Meeting the parents]]). The idea had arisen during the dinner, when (thorough engaged in conversation, not at all affected by the wine we were drinking or by the comradery Erin&#8217;s dad and I felt as we took on Erin in a battle of wits) Erin&#8217;s father had suggested that next time we might stay the night and not have to worry about what we ate or drank.<br />
Thanksgiving was just the next logical opportunity. And with my family out of town, there seemed no reason not to go.<br />
Not there wasn&#8217;t any possible apprehension. Let&#8217;s be realistic here &#8212; I&#8217;m spending over 24 hours with my girlfriend&#8217;s parents (in their home). I&#8217;ve met them from before, so in that respect there&#8217;s no pressure, but this is a slightly different aspect. In my last serious relationship, I spent the night on my first visit. But I slept in a separate bed. Erin and I were destined for the same room, same bed. At times, I almost worry that there&#8217;s *too* much acceptance. If that actually makes any sense&#8230;<br />
We headed out from Calgary late Sunday morning. I love long weekends &#8212; Sundays never seem sad because you don&#8217;t have to go to work the next day. I think I&#8217;ve always disliked Sunday for that reason. (I&#8217;ve never minded long weekend Mondays, though.) The day was cool, but bright, and the trip down to Nanton was fairly speedy &#8230; except for that stretch of Highway 2 just north of High River being repaved.<br />
Dinner preparation was already well underway. The turkey was due to hit the barbecue (yes, not the oven &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how well it works) at 13:00. As Erin and were running a little late, the original plans for lunch had to be altered. While Erin&#8217;s dad stuck around to ensure that the turkey hit the heat on time, Erin, Erin&#8217;s mom, and I went on a little trip to retrieve sustenance.<br />
Nanton&#8217;s a small town. Erin&#8217;s parents live a block away from the &#8220;downtown&#8221; core. (If you drive south from Calgary on Highway 2, you&#8217;ll pass right through downtown Nanton.) You can walk around the downtown in about 20 minutes, I think. About half of the stores are antique shops, there&#8217;s a couple of restaurants, a pub or two, a CIBC, one hotel (near as I can tell, anyway), and a few grain elevators.<br />
Nanton, once upon a time, was a (fairly) major station on CP&#8217;s MacLeod subdivision, when it ran from High River down to Ft. MacLeod. (Assumedly for lack of profitability, the subdivision was closed and the tracks ripped up south of High River between 1998 and 1999.) Today, the rail bed is still very visible, and the grain elevators sit forlorn, no longer in active (rail) use.<br />
Whether or not the disappearance of the railroad has led to Nanton&#8217;s shrinking commercial base (there are a number of closed businesses) is a debatable one. The loss of the railroad has affected other towns in the past (Hanna, Biggar, Melville, Stratford), and some manage to recover through various efforts (such as the Stratford Festival). Nanton, however, seems quite content to be as it is.<br />
The three of us wandered across a somewhat chilly downtown to a small restaurant on Highway 2 north (the highway divides running through Nanton), sitting between the road and the rail bed. While the name of the place completely escapes me, it&#8217;s the only (open) restaurant on that side of the road. There you&#8217;ll find all sorts of homemade-type foods. And without a doubt, possibly the best sandwich I&#8217;ve ever had. (Mind you, the uber-fresh, all-natural bread from a little bakery in High River contributed to that.)<br />
After some discussion, Erin and I went for a walk around town. Specifically, I wanted to see all the antique shops. I think Nanton&#8217;s second-largest industry after agriculture is antiques &#8212; there&#8217;s more stores in two blocks than in most of Calgary, I think. And the prices are actually pretty reasonable (well, except for one place). Most of the items are quite interesting, too, and you don&#8217;t have to spend huge amounts of time filtering through things.<br />
One store in particular is massive. Once upon a time, it was a hardware store on the main level, with apartments in the second floor. Now the entire building is nothing but antiques. Name it &#8212; it&#8217;s probably in there, somewhere. Once upon a time, so I&#8217;m told, the store owners had things laid out very carefully. The apartments were laid out as &#8220;suites&#8221;, with entire collections made out so you could (in theory) buy an entire suite at once. The original owners sold and moved on, and now things are just stacked to the ceiling.<br />
There was only one shop we didn&#8217;t make it into before closing time. But by then, Erin and I didn&#8217;t really care too much &#8212; the whine of Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; fridge and the musty smell of the antiques gave the both of us headaches. We retreated to Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; home to do something about the pain.<br />
Dinner was the traditional fare for Thanksgiving: turkey, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and buns. For most of the day, I managed to keep myself clear of food preparation. But as Erin was mashing potatoes, I felt the urge to suddenly interject.<br />
I have issues with mashed potatoes. I hate them. Well, to be specific, I hate plain mashed potatoes. They&#8217;re boring. They have no flavour, and almost no texture. It bothers me immensely. So when I saw Erin&#8217;s mom bringing out the milk, I suggested a slight modification to the dish: Beer.<br />
Yeah, I know, beer&#8217;s my solution for everything. In this case, it partly is. You want to make really good mashed potatoes? Here&#8217;s what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-6 medium-sized red skin potatoes</li>
<li>1 medium-sized white (or yellow) onion</li>
<li>2-5 cloves of garlic (depending on how strong you like)</li>
<li>1 can Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown (or beer of choice)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>dried or fresh rosemary</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean, but do not peel, the potatoes (there&#8217;s a lot of flavour in the skin). Cook as you would normally, until ready to mash. While cooking the potatoes, chop the onion and put into a frying pan on medium-low heat. Cover the frying pan with a lid, uncovering only occasionally to stir (you don&#8217;t want anything to burn). This will caramelize the onions. When you&#8217;re ready to start mashing the potatoes, chop and add the garlic to the onions. Mash the potatoes with a hand masher &#8212; it&#8217;s more work, but the texture is better than with a blender. Pour in only as much beer as you need to mash the potatoes. You can go for thick and chunky or &#8220;creamy&#8221;, depending on what you like (I find that just enough beer to take most of the large lumps out is perfect). Add the onion/garlic mixture, sprinkle some rosemary, and mash some more.<br />
Everyone seemed to like them. (Well, why wouldn&#8217;t they?)<br />
I also dabbled in making the gravy, when Erin&#8217;s mom tried to back out of making it by saying there weren&#8217;t enough drippings. (Small children could have swam with all the drippings we had.) I was more than happy to dive in and &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem.<br />
The turkey was completely free-range organic. The farm it came from (Sunworks Farm in Armena, AB) is so eco-friendly that its pamphlet even advertises that it&#8217;s &#8220;predator-friendly&#8221;. It&#8217;s more expensive, to be sure, but I have to say &#8212; you can taste what turkey is *supposed* to taste like. This is a farm I&#8217;m definitely going to have to look into much closer in the future.<br />
Oh. I have to mention the cranberry sauce. (I can hear the &#8220;oohs&#8221; from Cathy and Mom.) I&#8217;ve never liked cranberry sauce. Felt it was just not the sort of thing I would eat with turkey. Well, Erin&#8217;s mom pulled a recipe for &#8220;Gourmet Cranberry Sauce&#8221; from one of the bazillion &#8220;Best of Bridge&#8221; cookbooks. It&#8217;s essentially cranberries (fresh or frozen), oranges, and Gran Marnier. Screw the turkey &#8212; that stuff you can eat on its own.<br />
Even though we were quite full from the first round, we had to partake of dessert &#8212; pumpkin pie. As we briefly congregated in the kitchen to carry out the dessert, Erin&#8217;s mom suddenly thrust a small crystal bowl mostly filled with a transparent green substance.<br />
Lime Jell-o.<br />
Now, there are probably a few people in my family who will laugh at this. The rest of you are probably confused beyond all heck.<br />
What&#8217;s the deal with the lime Jell-o? This stems back to the last time I was in Nanton. I&#8217;d told Erin&#8217;s parents about Christmas (and other family dinners) at my father&#8217;s mother&#8217;s home in Leaside (Toronto). At the time, I&#8217;d hated all the other desserts: pies, some cakes, trifle, etc. So Grandma had always make bowls of Jell-o for me, which I sometimes had to fight over with others.<br />
Erin&#8217;s mom had remembered, and made me a bowl of Jell-o. Erin was thorough confused, apparently having forgotten that conversation. Heck, even *I* hadn&#8217;t realized why Erin&#8217;s mom had made it at first, until I remembered the stories I&#8217;d told the last time I was there.<br />
Needless to say, I like Erin&#8217;s parents.<br />
We had a late harvest Riesling with dessert. By that point, my stomach was crying &#8220;uncle&#8221;, and I spent about 45 minutes trying to put myself in a semi-comfortable position as not to feel too ill. Turkey coma kicked in about an hour later, and I ended up crawling into bed shortly after midnight.<br />
The next morning, it was my turn to cook. (I&#8217;d made this request from when it was suggested that I was coming to Nanton.) I&#8217;d been wanting to make my dad&#8217;s pancakes for years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t had them since Christmas of 2001, and was dying to have them again. So, with Erin&#8217;s family watching, I whipped up a batch of pancake batter, fried up some sausages (Erin&#8217;s mom made some really good bacon), and julienned a couple potatoes for hash browns.<br />
My poor stomach hadn&#8217;t recovered from dinner the night before.<br />
The sausages were thoroughly delightful, not the least of which was because they (like the turkey) were all-natural. Instead of fillers or sweeteners, there were cranberries. I&#8217;m certain the casings weren&#8217;t edible plastic, either.<br />
Having completely ruined my diet for about a month, Erin and I set up to head back to Calgary. Both of us had things to do, and while sticking around was a good thought, we readied to roll. But not without trucking back enough food for a small battalion.<br />
I love leftovers. Especially when it&#8217;s turkey.</p>

		<p>This weekend, I visited southern Ontario. Even though I&#8217;ve only just left, it almost feels like I was never even there.<br />
A few weeks back, Critical Mass announced (to the employees) that it was in the process of pitching a very large client (see [[Friends: Visiting and moving away]]). And no, I still can&#8217;t tell you who it is.<br />
Anyway, at the time, there was the great expectation that I&#8217;d be coming out to Toronto to help interview people and (ultimately) help set up the team in the Toronto office &#8212; assuming that we won the work.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass is growing. We&#8217;re preparing for a (hoped) massive expansion, but also have organic growth to contend with.<br />
This is what led Critical Mass to have to hire a new Project Analyst. And luckily for me, it&#8217;s my friend Graham.<br />
You might remember Graham from a couple train chases, specifically my last hunt of 6060 (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]) and from the Inaugural Run of the CPR Empress (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It&#8217;s because of Graham&#8217;s ex-girlfriend that I met Graham while chasing 2816, because I looked a little lost. Since them, Graham and I have forged an interesting friendship, based mostly around trains.<br />
This means, of course, that I&#8217;m no longer the only train guy in the office. And some people here already know this. When Graham came for his first interview, Claude asked him about his hobbies, which included (of course) chasing trains. They asked if Graham knew me.<br />
Now this is where I got screwed. You see, Graham didn&#8217;t apply for this job because of me. I didn&#8217;t even know about it. Graham applied knowing that I work for Critical Mass. Because he wanted to get in on his own merit, he feined ignorance of me. If I&#8217;d had the chance to recommend him (and I would have), I could have received a $1,000 referral bonus.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Either way, it&#8217;s all good. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see Graham more than I have in the past (which isn&#8217;t that much), but with him on the fourth floor and me on the second, it&#8217;s hard to say how much our paths will cross.<br />
And we have to be a little cautious. If both of us ever called in sick at once, the immediate assumption would be that we&#8217;re chasing trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I did the one thing that most guys dread when they get into a relationship.<br />
I met the parents.<br />
This was something Erin and I had discussed several times over the last week or so. It sounds like a huge deal, I&#8217;m sure. It means I&#8217;m getting serious &#8212; why would I meet her parents otherwise, right?<br />
Things aren&#8217;t quite *that* serious. In fact, the primary reason I&#8217;m meeting her parents isn&#8217;t because I need to start calling them &#8220;Mom and Dad&#8221;, but because they&#8217;re an important part of Erin&#8217;s life. She sees them almost every weekend, and talks to them almost every day. It&#8217;s the same as introducing Erin to Scott when he was in town.<br />
So, with that in mind, we took off from Calgary late this morning for Nanton, a small town about 45 minutes south of the city. It&#8217;s an easy drive &#8212; Highway 2 runs right through the middle of town, and Erin and I rarely stop talking.<br />
Erin was trying to psyche me out. Although this was important to her, she was trying to have as much fun with it as possible. But despite trying as hard as she could, Erin was more nervous about me meeting her parents than I was. (Of course, it helps to have gone through this before, but on a bigger scale &#8212; see [[Visiting Friends in Calgary, Deciding to Leave Vancouver]].)<br />
Erin&#8217;s parents met us at the door. I presented Erin&#8217;s mom with a bouquet of flowers in thanks for hosting us for the day. (My mother drilled into me the need to make sure that I don&#8217;t show up empty-handed.) Erin&#8217;s dad was quick with a handshake. Within minutes, I had a &#8220;slush&#8221; in hand &#8212; basically, a home-made bellini. (If you don&#8217;t know what a bellini is, just think of it as an alcoholic Slurpee.)<br />
Now this is when you&#8217;d expect 20 Questions. In fact, we ended up starting down a path quite humourous. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Make Fun of Erin&#8221;.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; this is risky business. This is the sort of thing that gets me in big trouble with the significant other. For the record, I didn&#8217;t start this &#8212; Erin&#8217;s dad did. Erin and her father have an odd relationship of constantly badgering each other. I just jumped on the bandwagon when I had the opportunity to get a couple of jabs in. I caught a few &#8220;oooooh, you&#8217;ll get yours&#8221; glares from Erin, but haven&#8217;t (as of yet) received anything in return.<br />
Erin&#8217;s an only child, so is close to her parents. But make no mistakes, Erin is not the spoiled brat one might expect. Erin&#8217;s upbringing was controlled (which led Erin&#8217;s mother at one point to declare &#8220;there&#8217;s only one thing we didn&#8217;t let you do&#8221;, which of course took on the wrong connotation and nearly left me in convulsions). Erin doesn&#8217;t get away with much, especially with her father on her case. (I just tagged along for the ride.)<br />
We had loosely planned to visit for a while and then go look at all the antique stores in Nanton. But soon we were into the Las Vegas photo albums, and Erin&#8217;s dad hauled out their rather impressive collection of Canadian Mint coins. Before we knew it, it was dinner time.<br />
Beef tenderloin, cabbage salad (from which the mushrooms were withheld because someone had told Erin&#8217;s parents that mushrooms and I don&#8217;t get along), cheese bread, baked potatoes, and beans. Far more than I&#8217;d ever expected, and all delicious. We talked almost the entire dinner.<br />
And did I mention the bundt cake? Erin&#8217;s mom made a cake based on her aunt&#8217;s recipe. It comes with a white chocolate glaze that just about sent my blood sugar count through the ceiling. And worth every vibrated tooth.<br />
But before long, it was just past 20:00, and we had to head back to the city. It&#8217;s a 45 minute drive to Erin&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s another 20-30 minutes to my house. I need to make sure I hit the gym tomorrow to try and work some of the dinner off.<br />
We&#8217;ll be back. I&#8217;ve been invited for Thanksgiving. The question is who&#8217;ll be the bigger turkey: me, or the bird.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just when you think it&#8217;s safe not to worry about having to put out any additional funds for home improvement, the proverbial crap hits the fan.<br />
Or in this case, the sewer line.<br />
For the record, it wasn&#8217;t *my* sewer line. It&#8217;s my neighbours&#8217;. As you might recall from a previous note about my house (see [[Strange Things that Happen while Buying a House]]), the house next door to mine is a mirror image. They were built at the same time, using the same (but reversed) floor plan, and similar construction. In fact, when built, the houses were so similar they even put in the sewer lines at the same time, a scant six inches from each other as they go out to the road.<br />
Yes, you are correct: &#8220;Uh oh&#8221;.<br />
Now to really get things into perspective, you need to understand two things: 1) The sewer lines are original, meaning they were put in place 91 years ago, using materials common to construction 91 years ago. 2) There were a number of trees planted and removed over the last 91 years.<br />
What&#8217;s this mean? Allow me to explain&#8230;<br />
About three weeks ago, I sat on my couch (okay, I was sprawled all over it&#8230;) watching either TV or a movie (can&#8217;t remember which). I noticed a City of Calgary Waterworks Emergency truck pull up in front on my home. The passenger shone his flashlight at the street numbers, hard to see in the late evening light. I became worried when they stopped in front of my home. I suddenly was worried that there was something up with my sewer that I didn&#8217;t know about.<br />
They went to my neighbours&#8217; place. They came back the next day, followed soon after by Roto-Rooter. Finally talking to Neil, I got the scoop: a section of their sewer line, outside of City property (hence, responsibility) was so blocked that Roto-Rooter couldn&#8217;t get through it with their gizmos. Near as the technicians could figure, the pipe had collapsed.<br />
What had caused the pipe to collapse? Well, we&#8217;re not entirely sure about that, but we&#8217;re pretty certain it was the aforementioned trees. Whether it was that blasted poplar that&#8217;s been wreaking havoc, or it was the tree that (until recently) sat above the pipes is anyone&#8217;s guess. But age combined with root taps had done in the wonder of the modern age, and it was time for it to be replaced.<br />
This meant digging. This is when I find out that our two sewer lines are a scant six inches apart, right in the same area as our water lines.<br />
Oh yeah, I was just *loving* this.<br />
I&#8217;m not about to be the kind of assoholic neighbour that&#8217;ll stand up and say: &#8220;Sure, you want to replace the sewer? Go nuts. You can pay for mine while you&#8217;re at it.&#8221; Why? Well, aside knowing that I was likely in the same boat, there&#8217;s a neat little book floating around that has a good piece of advice in it: Love thy neighbour. (I might not be a religious person, but books of faith often have some good common-sense thoughts in them.)<br />
So last Wednesday, bolted home to get started on the dirty work. The lines ran underneath a section of grass shared by the two properties, divided by a fence and a tree. Because this section would be completely dug out, the fence had to go, and the tree had to come down. By the time I got home, Neil and Daryl were already at work.<br />
The front fence at Neil and Daryl&#8217;s place had to come down completely. The section of fence from the property line to my front gate had to come out (thankfully, not the rest). And, of course, the fence down the property line. Above the ground, the fence looked pretty good. But as we dug it out, we realized that the people who&#8217;d put it there had not used treated wood. A few more years, and it would have had to have been replaced, anyway.<br />
The tree was the fun part. None of us had power tools suited to the job. All we did have were handsaws and a length of rope. (The rope was tied off to branches to keep the houses from being hit.) At first, the job was pretty easy. But as we started getting to the larger branches, it became a much harder problem. We sawed and hacked (with a hatchet) through thick branches, and then would all get on the end of the rope to try and pull the branch down.<br />
Across the road, the superintendant of one of the apartment buildings had been watching our progress. He sauntered (slowly) across the road to see how we were doing.<br />
Him: So. (Pause) Looks like you&#8217;re cutting down a tree.<br />
Us: Really? We thought we were putting up a monument to Che Guevara&#8230;<br />
Him: You&#8217;re going about it the wrong way.<br />
Us: Actually, we felt we needed to get back to our Amish roots.<br />
Him: Let me go get you my chainsaw.<br />
Us: You kind, generous, thoughtful man! We are forever in your debt!<br />
So the superintendant sauntered (slowly) back across the road, returning (slowly) with his electric chainsaw. After giving Neil a demonstration of how to use it, we set down to the task of cutting down (and chopping up) the remainder of the tree. Neil and Daryl hauled off the remains to &#8230; well, somewhere, but I never did find out.<br />
Yesterday, the digging started. Roto-Rooter brought in a backhoe, and began the task of uncovering the pipes. Neil was there at the beginning to oversee the work (though he ended up staying the entire day), and called me with updates as things happened.<br />
Teak and I had planned to get together for lunch, but I ended up having to ask him to drive me home so I could see what was going on. The trench was unreal &#8212; roots sprouted out everywhere. It was amazing the sewer pipes were intact at all.<br />
They&#8217;d dug all the way back between the houses. (We&#8217;ll have to replace the concrete pathways next spring.) Neil and Daryl&#8217;s cast-iron house pipe was exposed, but my pipe was still clay. The houses might be identical, but things were definitely not equal under the surface. (An additional five feet of digging still didn&#8217;t find the pipe, but they did find an excellent quality clay pipe to use for a connection.)<br />
While my sewer line hadn&#8217;t yet collapsed, it was just a matter of time. Roots had grown in a tight mass inside my line, and had actually started to grow up the pipes into the house. Before connecting the new sewer pipe (something called &#8220;Schedule 40&#8221; PVC), Roto-Rooter cleaned out all the roots they could. (We did a flush test when Tamara got home, to make sure water was flowing freely.)<br />
By the time I got home, just after 20:40, the work was done. The pipes were in place, the dirt filled back in. It was far from perfect &#8212; the torn-up ground was nothing to look at, and the walkways were a disaster. I&#8217;m actually hoping it snows soon so I don&#8217;t have to look at it. Looks like I&#8217;ve already got some home improvement projects set up for next year&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s another cost I hadn&#8217;t planned (or expected). It&#8217;s another one of those joys of owning a home. (The next owner is gonna have it soooo easy.) On the bright side, it&#8217;s something else I won&#8217;t have to worry about.<br />
As the saying goes, shit happens. But now, it&#8217;ll flow a lot more freely.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in early August, I learned the awful truth that Therese and Stuart were moving to Montreal, ne&#8217;er to return. (Okay, that&#8217;s an assumption. They might, but I ain&#8217;t holding my breath.)<br />
Needless to say, I suddenly ran into the problem of living in the big city of Calgary without any close friends. (Okay, that&#8217;s an exaggeration. I do have a fabulous roommate &#8212; say &#8220;hi&#8221;, Tamara!) Faced with a prolonged period of time (mostly) alone, I felt I needed something a little more.<br />
Now, my experience in this city has been one of dichotomy. While it appears to be full of young, single people, none of them appear to be women and even fewer seem to be interested in me. Given, I wasn&#8217;t trolling bars or clubs. That&#8217;s because the pickings in those places is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that when you&#8217;re looking for Dom Perignon, y&#8217;ain&#8217;t about to settle for Baby Duck.<br />
This is what led me to (drum roll, please) the Internet.<br />
You: And here I thought you were going to say &#8220;train station&#8221;.<br />
Me: Ha ha&#8230;<br />
You: Though I suppose we shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised about the Internet, either.<br />
Me: Remember who you&#8217;re talking to.<br />
As was once quoted in the movie &#8220;American Pie&#8221;, God bless the Internet. You can find *anything* there. I mean it &#8212; look long enough, and you&#8217;ll eventually come across something that pretty much fits exactly what you need.<br />
This is how I found Erin.<br />
A couple years ago, I&#8217;d heard of a site called &#8220;Lavalife&#8221;. It&#8217;s a pseudo-dating site. I say &#8220;pseudo&#8221; because the site itself does nothing to set you up with anyone else. It&#8217;s solely for providing a place for people find each other. It&#8217;s up to the individual to contact someone else. What happens from there is up to you and your ability not to come across as a schmuck.<br />
And yes, somehow, I managed to do just that. (Or Erin is kind enough to overlook and not mention it.)<br />
We met online, under aliases, and exchanged email. (It shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising as a result that email constitutes the majority of our communication.) That led to online chatting (through MSN) and eventually to the (*gasp*) phone number exchange. It was still a while after that before we actually met for the first time.<br />
This is the great thing about using the Internet for dating, particularly on dating sites such as Lavalife: quality. (Okay, not entirely true. Erin&#8217;s told me a few horror stories of some of the guys she met online.) Generally-speaking, people who come to Lavalife have a similar goal: to meet someone else. You&#8217;re not dealing with pounding music, a smoky room, or people so fake that it&#8217;s actually painful. There&#8217;s no commitment, and there&#8217;s no requirement. It&#8217;s just you, a keyboard, and a digital photo of yourself (technically optional, but you&#8217;ll want one anyway).<br />
Somehow, all that managed to get me introduced to Erin, though I honestly can&#8217;t remember who made first contact. (Not that it really matters now.)<br />
So, what do you want to know about Erin? Well, she&#8217;s a little younger than I (if you think I&#8217;m giving out age, you&#8217;re definitely mistaken), a little shorter than me (which is not a big deal), but is big on conversation, movies, having a good time, and above all, getting to know people. We clicked on the first date, which either says a lot for me, or for Erin&#8217;s ability to see past all that freakishness that seems to scare everyone else away.<br />
One of the weirdest things, which we learned very early on in one of our phone calls, is that we work barely over a block from each other. Were it not for the Ribtor building, we&#8217;d probably be able to see each other&#8217;s workplace. Unfortunately, despite proximity, having mutual lunches is exceedingly difficult due to Erin&#8217;s schedule. Perhaps one day&#8230;<br />
So you could say that I have a new girlfriend. Well, sorta, anyway. For now, we&#8217;re sticking to just &#8220;seeing each other&#8221;. It&#8217;s not for a want of using something more definite, but just because we don&#8217;t want to rush things too much (we&#8217;re still firmly in &#8220;Discovery&#8221; mode). But I see no reason why I wouldn&#8217;t be calling Erin my girlfriend before too long.<br />
And this time, she&#8217;s not a 637,540 pound steam locomotive. (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]] for an explanation of that little joke.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is nothing harder in life than saying goodbye to a loved one. This evening, I had to make the hardest choice of my life. This evening, I had to put my beloved Siamese cat to sleep. A year and a half and one day ago, my father passed away. Tonight, Spaz goes to join him, together again. They were inseparable while Dad was alive. It seems only fitting that they are now reunited.<br />
It is particularly hard to accept this, especially coming after yesterday&#8217;s high, remembering the first anniversary of the CBC 50th Anniversary Train. To come from a high to a low in such a period certainly does not help one&#8217;s happiness quotia. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for one night, in a vain attempt to kill the pain.<br />
Spaz was born in either 1989 or 1991, depending on who you ask. I believe it is the former, but her medical records suggest the latter. She was a gift from my Aunt Ruth to my grandmother, who named her Yum-Yum, after one of the characters in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;Mikado&#8221;. My grandmother wasn&#8217;t one for names, though, and soon was calling her &#8220;Puss&#8221;, as she had every other cat. I was the only one who called her &#8220;Spaz&#8221;, referring to her spastic behaviour as a kitten.<br />
Over the years, Spaz became an absolutely personable cat. She would immediately warm up to whomever was in the room, usually beelining for the person most allergic to her. She rarely bit anyone, and if she did it was because they weren&#8217;t giving her enough seafood. After Grandma moved into a retirement apartment, Dad took in Spaz, where they became fast friends. Spaz saw much of North America travelling with my parents. When Dad died last year, I took Spaz into my home, as Mom has never really been a huge fan of pets. Spaz and I enjoyed over a year together, sleeping in the same bed, often under the same covers.<br />
(I should note that when I spoke with Mom earlier this evening, she was almost as upset as I was. Mom might have not been a big fan of pets, but Spaz was such a great cat that she grew on everyone around her.)<br />
Over the last two months, I saw a change in Spaz, though I wasn&#8217;t fully willing to accept it. Mom was the one to finally bring it to light when she was out visiting. Spaz was underweight. She was not as responsive as in her glory. I think I refused to believe that perhaps the end was in sight.<br />
Yesterday, as Tamara and I returned from a matinee, I found Spaz coughing in a way I&#8217;d never seen her before, and spitting up material I&#8217;d never seen. Fearing the worst, I immediately took her to the Calgary North Animal Hospital (on a recommendation from Scott and Tara, whose cats have visited probably more times than they care to wish). Spaz was immediately admitted and almost immediately transferred to an oxygen tent. Blue at admitting, she was soon able to breathe.<br />
I waited in Exam Room 1 for the doctor, reading the poster for anatomy on ferrets. Outside, I could hear a boy, no more than five years old, crying desperately to his mother about never seeing his pet again. Inside, I felt like that five year old. Somehow, I knew that Spaz would never be coming home again.<br />
Over the next 18 hours, Spaz was checked, prodded, poked, and tested. At about 16:45, I received a call from Dr. Henderson, who began to explain to me the seriousness of Spaz&#8217;s condition. Although she didn&#8217;t say it outright, I knew what she was telling me. Spaz&#8217;s life was at an end, and there was likely little veterinary science could do to save her. I had known Spaz for almost half my life, and while I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her go, I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her suffer for my own selfish needs.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what exactly Spaz was suffering from, neither did Dr. Henderson. But suffering, she was. Blood tests were inconclusive, but Dr. Henderson was confident that the problems weren&#8217;t from asthma, which Spaz had dealt with for many years. This was far more serious. My conversation with the vet only seemed to conclude that tests would only show what would ultimately kill Spaz, not what could cure her.<br />
It was raining when Tamara and I drove up to the hospital. Spaz was in an incubator &#8212; the kind used for premature babies. She was warm, as I&#8217;d always hoped she&#8217;d be at the end. But she was unresponsive. She seemed to only vaguely know that we were there. There was no purring. Although she was lying upright (not on her side), she didn&#8217;t really respond the way she had less than two days before.<br />
We left the hospital, passing by the front clerk. She asked if we were sure that we didn&#8217;t want to be there with her. I barely choked out a &#8220;no, thanks&#8221; as we passed by. I nearly lost control twice on my way out the door. I couldn&#8217;t be there, although it broke my heart not to be with her at the end.<br />
It helped having Tamara with me as we drove home. Without her, I would not have been able to focus on the road. I was numb. When Dad passed away, I was saddened, but knew that his end was coming. Spaz&#8217;s death I was not prepared for, though I knew that by bringing her to Alberta, I might have only extended her life by a year. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for it.<br />
The best part about driving in the rain is that no-one can see you crying.<br />
Farewell, dear Spaz. May you, Dad, and Grandma be reunited again.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that it&#8217;s only been a year since the day the CBC Television 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train departed Vancouver on its epic 33-day trip across Canada. It seems like it&#8217;s been a lot longer.<br />
I suppose part of that is because I live in Calgary, isolated from nearly everyone else on the trip. (Enza&#8217;s very close to me, living in Banff, but I don&#8217;t have the luxury of working in the same building, as most of the Toronto folk do.) I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to see a couple of people &#8212; Angela and Tracy when they stopped through on a documentary tour (see [[CBC documentaries at the Glenbow Museum]]), and Julie and Enza when Julie came out on a conference (we met in Banff). Beyond that, the only contact I&#8217;ve had is through email.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate saying goodbye to close friends. Early this morning, Therese and Stuart boarded their WestJet flight with a trunkful of luggage and two cats. They&#8217;re moving to Montreal. By about this time, they&#8217;re over Ontario, about an hour from landing in Ottawa.<br />
For the last three and a half years, I&#8217;ve had the luxury of living in a city with three of my closest friends. Chris lived with me for two of those years. But Chris moved to Japan, and while we do keep regular communication through email and ICQ, it&#8217;s just not the same as having him here. I didn&#8217;t see Stuart and Therese nearly as much as I would have liked, but having them in the same city was just somehow comforting.<br />
Now I feel almost alone. I have friends here, yes, but none like them. None with whom I have a great history. None where even just a simple hug can convey more words than a 100-page treatise on friendship. They&#8217;re more family than friend. I&#8217;ll see them again, of that there is no doubt, but it won&#8217;t be for at least a couple of weeks. (Both need to come back over the next two months, Stuart to get their belongings moved, and Therese for her dissertation.) After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess.<br />
On Saturday, I went to a small get-together for Stuart and Therese at Stephanie&#8217;s home. (Stephanie is Therese&#8217;s classmate and friend.) There were only about 10 people in attendance. I know them all, but hadn&#8217;t seen some in well over a year. We talked, ate, and played with Pepper, Stephanie and Ian&#8217;s Westhighland Terrier. Yet despite all the laughter and good humour, there was an underlying tension. Two people were leaving.<br />
I spent most of Sunday cleaning up around the house. I haven&#8217;t cleaned much this summer, owing to a busy schedule. Things are almost back to normal. It was a way for me to kill time until Therese and Stuart called. I had offered to take them out to dinner, but as with every major move I&#8217;ve ever seen, packing was still going on right until they called me at about 18:30, to help clean out Therese&#8217;s office.<br />
I felt strangely in the way as I helped move boxes of papers and books into the Jetta and the Mini. (If you think a Mini is small, just see what you can pack in one!) It took a couple of hours, but we made off with everything inside. Stuart and I would return later, having accidentally forgotten a poster in the computer lab (which led to a fairly tense time trying to remember the door code) and needing to drop off a guitar and a glass vase.<br />
Dropping Stuart off, I drove off into the night, with a single thought in my mind:<br />
Movement is life. Be it physical or existential, it is nonetheless important and necessary. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are moving from one city to the next, or from one state of mind to the next, just so long as you move. You will only feel true pain if you stop moving.<br />
Good luck, and best hopes and wishes, my friends! Never stop moving.</p>
