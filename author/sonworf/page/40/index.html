	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First and foremost, I apologise for not writing sooner. It&#8217;s been over a month since my last message, and I can safely say that in those four weeks, I&#8217;ve been so busy that I can group my life into three categories: Work, spending time with Allison, and sleeping. Those of you who know me can probably guess where the majority of my time was spent. (For those of you who don&#8217;t, the list is in order of time spent.)<br />
This means that I&#8217;ve had little time for the basic things, like shopping for food and laundry. Needless to say, email fell quite sharply in priority. But with things winding down (at least a little), I&#8217;m finding the time to write.<br />
What has kept me so busy? Well, if you&#8217;ll remember from one of my last messages, I was hired by Radical Entertainment (<a href="http://www.radical.ca/">www.radical.ca</a> &#8212; yes, the website&#8217;s pretty blaise, but apparently we&#8217;re working on it) as a technical writer. For those of you who missed it the first time, Radical makes video games.<br />
You&#8217;d think that working for a video game company means I play video games all day. Well, you&#8217;d be pretty much correct &#8230; at least when there&#8217;s a good Quake 2 deathmatch, or someone starts a game of Worms 2. And then there&#8217;s the previews of our own games, not to mention the zillions of demos we go through in a week &#8230; bla bla bla. Sounds pretty dull, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
The week after I started, Tim (I seem to be cursed with bosses named &#8216;Tim&#8217;) gave me first big assignment: get the documentation ready for the next software release &#8230; two weeks later.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t sound too bad, does it? Well, allow me to provide some details. The team I work in is called &#8220;Pure3D&#8221;, and they&#8217;re the rendering gurus of the company. They write all the functions and libraries that all the game teams use to make video games. This means that I had to learn everything there was to know about computer graphics in a very short span of time. I also had to learn what all the software did, how to use it, and how to use the existing documentation format.<br />
Needless to say, the documentation didn&#8217;t meet with my satisfaction. The fact was, I simply didn&#8217;t have the time to do the job I wanted to do. Another month and a half, and I might have been able to straighten the whole thing out.<br />
Almost immediately following, I got drafted to do the Scientific Research and Experimental Development report so we could get a chunk of money back from the Feds. I had done one last year for Arkipelago, so I was familiar with the report. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for the sheer amount of work that Radical does in a year. The document stands at over 100 pages, and I&#8217;m still not done editing it.<br />
That has been the majority of my time for the past little while. It&#8217;s rather draining, but it&#8217;s also a lot of fun. And I know I&#8217;m getting satisfaction from the job. So all in all, I have nothing to complain about.<br />
All this means that I haven&#8217;t been getting out of Vancouver much. I didn&#8217;t even really do anything fun until last weekend, when Allison and I decided we&#8217;d look into (everyone brace yourselves for this) condos.<br />
Yes, condos. Glorified apartments. Condos are the most cost-effective real estate in the lower mainland &#8230; unless you&#8217;re rich and can afford the housing out here. Mind you, even after Allison and I looked around, we weren&#8217;t too impressed with the condos out here.<br />
In fact, we were so unimpressed, that we came to the conclusion that there was only one place we could live &#8212; Calgary. Vancouver&#8217;s too expensive, and Allison doesn&#8217;t like the suburbs. (Frankly, I agree with her.) So when it comes time for us to settle down, we have to leave.<br />
We did some calculations, and we found that no matter how we looked at it, living in Vancouver (condo or not) just wasn&#8217;t worth the money. We make sure of our ideas by popping onto a real estate database (www.mls.com) to see what we could find in Calgary. (If anyone&#8217;s interested, there&#8217;s some really nice properties in Banff for less than $200k.)<br />
Since then, we&#8217;ve also started considering Victoria. The only reason we&#8217;re a little apprehensive about Victoria is that it&#8217;s &#8230; well, quiet. Very quiet. Disturbingly quiet. It&#8217;s for the Just Wed and Nearly Dead, so I hear. Certainly feels that way too.<br />
We started looking ahead to vacations. We think we&#8217;re going to take two one-week vacations and explore the coasts of the US &#8212; east in late August, and west in late fall. But then again, we may go to Hawaii&#8230; We&#8217;re still thinking. There&#8217;s also Prince Albert National Park, where I can see my relatives, but that&#8217;s just a thought at this point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Greetings from Lotus Land! (I still have no idea why people call it that &#8212; nowadays you could reefer to it as Grass Land &#8230; yes, I spelled &#8220;reefer&#8221; on purpose.)<br />
Undoubtedly you&#8217;ve all heard the trials and tribulations of Ross Rebagliati (sp?), the Canadian Snowboarding gold medalist. The whole thing wasn&#8217;t really played up too much around here, other than we thought that it was a really dumb thing to get worked up about. It all came down to punctuation for us:<br />
Rest of the World: They smoke marijuana in Whistler?<br />
British Columbia: They smoke marijuana in Whistler.<br />
(It&#8217;s not a question, it&#8217;s a fact. You could also have written our response a little more succinctly: &#8220;DUH!&#8221;)<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that jokes weren&#8217;t flying about &#8212; one had Ross as the new spokesperson for Hostess. (Y&#8217;know &#8212; &#8220;when you got the munchies&#8230;&#8221;)<br />
Life wound up at Prologic Corp. right on schedule, and I left on Friday without a hitch. And then it was off for the weekend.<br />
Allison and I made plans to spend Valentine&#8217;s day in Victoria. But first, we had to get to the island. At roughly 17:15, we departed the office, jumped in Allison&#8217;s car, and headed to Horseshoe Bay, which is roughly north-west of Vancouver. Although the ferry port at Tswassen (which is pronounced &#8220;swaa-sen&#8221; or &#8220;te-waa-sen&#8221;, depending on who you ask) was closer, there was a two sailing wait (there were *that* many cars waiting to leave &#8212; each ferry takes between 150 and 200 cars, and the sailings are at most once an hour), and we wanted to be in Nanaimo before 22:00, if possible.<br />
We arrived at Horseshoe Bay about 18:15 or so (yes, it took that long to get there). We purchased a ticket for the next sailing, which was 19:00. Unlike Tswassen, we wouldn&#8217;t have to wait.<br />
This was a good thing. The ferry takes a minimum of an hour and a half to get to the other side. We arrived in Nanaimo around 20:45 (counting the delays, and the loading/unloading time), and we promptly headed for Fast Eddies, a local favourite restaurant (best blackened chicken I&#8217;ve had outside of New Orleans!). We wanted to have dinner before descending on Allison&#8217;s parents.<br />
When arrived at the Collins family estate, Allison expressed her concern that she might not be able to sneak me inside &#8212; all the doors were locked. Why did she want to sneak me inside &#8212; several of her relatives were there. I was worried enough about meeting her parents, let alone a portion of her family tree (albeit a small portion &#8212; apparently Allison&#8217;s family tree is quite extensive).<br />
The introductions went quite well (I wasn&#8217;t immediately thrown out of the house, nor was I asked a great deal of embarrasing questions). Of course, I figured a way out of receiving the Evil Eyes &#8212; I brought a box of chocolates for Allison&#8217;s parents. When in doubt, go for the brownie points!<br />
(I&#8217;ve since found out that I&#8217;ve passed the &#8220;first test&#8221;. I&#8217;m somewhat apprehensive about the &#8220;second test&#8221;.)<br />
The conversation was not centred around me (thankfully), but it allowed me to get my foot in once in a while (I know families where you have to shout to be heard). But the family slowly weeded itself down until it was just Mr. and Mrs. Collins, Allison, and myself. Her sister Jane, who bears a striking resemblance to Kirsten Dunst (who appeared in such movies as Interview with the Vampire and Wag the Dog) showed up later, and promptly started downing a litre of cold pre-made cappaccino. Allison&#8217;s brother Randy appeared about a half hour afterwards.<br />
The next day we drove down the Island Highway (aka Canada Route 1, aka the Trans Canada Highway) to Victoria. Some parts of that trip were like travelling through a fairy tale &#8212; huge trees coated with deep green moss, huge cliffs dripping with lush vegetation &#8212; a rainforest without monkeys or macaus.<br />
Victoria was decidedly nicer than Nanaimo &#8212; namely, it wasn&#8217;t raining. We checked into the James Bay Inn (Victoria has a big thing about James Bay, for some strange reason), which was a block from the house Emily Carr was born in. We then decided to walk around Victoria.<br />
Victoria is a beautiful city &#8212; it reminds me very much of more European cities &#8212; Helsinki, most notably. I think it&#8217;s one of the smallest capitals in Canada &#8212; certainly the smallest west of Quebec (and south of the northern Territories). It&#8217;s also very relaxed. VERY relaxed. No-one seems in a rush (of course, all the horse-drawn carriages might attribute to that).<br />
We visited the Royal BC Museum (not as extensive as the ROM, but I think the collection of Native artifacts cannot be paralleled &#8212; except maybe by the Museum of Anthropology at UBC), which took us a couple of hours. Then we wandered over to a place called &#8220;Undersea World&#8221; (or some similarly cheesy name). It&#8217;s a building set into the harbour, with a few walls around the outside in the water. It&#8217;s an aquarium essentially, but the water&#8217;s right out of the bay (there are grates that open right into the surrounding water). The admission included a 15 minute scuba show where a diver showed off some of the various fauna of the deep.<br />
The most surprising thing I saw in that show was the conditioning of the fish &#8212; not the water conditioning, I mean the mental conditioning! I had always assumed (rather naively, so it seems) that the brain stems of fish were capable of only providing survival instincts &#8212; that fish couldn&#8217;t really &#8220;learn&#8221; things. The diver proved me very wrong. He pulled out a triangle (the kind you see in old westerns when Cookie calls the cowboys for dinner) and rang it. All the fish suddenly turned and gravitated towards him. Mondo creepy. Pavlov would be proud.<br />
We proceeded along the roads to see what there was to see, which included Chinatown, and Fan Tan Alley &#8212; the narrowest road in Canada. It&#8217;s about a metre wide. There are actual addresses (stores, specifically), so it&#8217;s a designated (complete with postal code) road. Parts of &#8220;Bird on a Wire&#8221; (filmed in 1990, starring Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn) were filmed in Vancouver and Victoria, including Fan Tan Alley.<br />
We had a very filling meal at a local Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (Note: Victoria&#8217;s Chinatown is less than a block, and is mostly for tourists). The service was lousy, but the food was great! The meal ended with the traditional fortune cookies. I had to laugh when I read my fortune: &#8220;Luck is coming your way.&#8221; (This is funny when you remember to read it the way you&#8217;re supposed to read fortunes.)<br />
The next morning (this morning), we toured around the city, where I made an effort to take a picture of the beginning of the Trans Canada Highway (yes kiddies, the TCH *starts* in Victoria &#8212; how&#8217;s that for trivia? Fool your friends!) We then wound our way to Craigdarroch Castle, built by millionaire coal baron (and all-round nasty guy) Robert Dunsmuir. Rumour has it that he blew up a mine full of workers (seven died) because of complains about the quality of life, the lack of wages, and so forth. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be too much sentiment for the guy.<br />
Finally, we headed back to Vancouver, via the Schwartz Bay ferry terminal. We barely missed making the ferry, and had to wait an hour until the next sailing. I will say one thing for the ferries in BC &#8212; they&#8217;re usually pretty nice, and the trip from Schwartz Bay to Tswassen is a beautiful one! I highly recommend it to anyone making the trip! (Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay is mostly in open water, but gives you a great view of the mountains on a clear day).<br />
Anyhoo, this log is plently long enough for now. I now leave you to your regular activities&#8230;<br />
By the way, for those of you who don&#8217;t know the &#8220;real&#8221; way you&#8217;re supposed to read a fortune, you add &#8220;in bed&#8221; at the end. Believe it or not, most fortunes make more sense that way&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is the big day &#8212; I finally get my apartment, and I can make a trip to IKEA so I can put something in my apartment other than myself!<br />
At any rate&#8230;<br />
The weather out here has been really good lately. It&#8217;s been warming up (apparently spring starts in a couple of weeks!), I actually had my sandals on yesterday! (There&#8217;s something I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do in Ontario for at least a couple of months!)<br />
Ran across the border yesterday (we&#8217;re less than a half hour away, or so it seems). It seems very weird to go across the border without having to cross a bridge.<br />
Lots of good restaurants out here. Not having an apartment makes eating a little difficult, so we&#8217;ve been trying all sorts of interesting places. There&#8217;s a place in Kitsilano (down on the south side of English Bay) called &#8220;Naam&#8221;, which is an all vegetarian restaurant. I have to admit, whole almonds in a meal aren&#8217;t that bad&#8230;<br />
Then there&#8217;s &#8220;All India Foods and Sweets&#8221;, a small (but very busy) Indian restaurant. They&#8217;ve got a vegetarian buffet that&#8217;s a killer! Really spicy food all for $6! Can&#8217;t go wrong there!<br />
Sushi is cheap here. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to get any yet, but you can buy large trays (18 pcs) for $3-$6. And I don&#8217;t need to tell you how fresh it is. You can&#8217;t go through some parts of the city without seeing a sushi bar every minute or so.<br />
Then there&#8217;s some of the chain restaurants: Milestone&#8217;s (a kind of upscale bar/eatery that serves huge portions for next to nothing, and the food is always great), Earl&#8217;s (those of you in the west have heard of them, but for those of you in the east, I feel sorry that you can&#8217;t try them out!), and OSF (the Old Spaghetti Factory &#8212; yeah, I know there&#8217;s one in Toronto, but I still like the place).<br />
Anyway, enough on food&#8230; now I&#8217;m all hungry and I haven&#8217;t had breakfast yet!<br />
Well, I think I&#8217;m going to have to cut this short, because I have to start moving. (Not that it will take me a long time, but it&#8217;s still gotta be done.)<br />
More updates as events occur!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We arrived late last night, no thanks to our most punctual airline. We made the mistake of taking a charter flight. What made it worse that the charter airline sub-contracted another charter airline to fly us to Vancouver. Air Transat isn&#8217;t exactly known for comfort. Royal Airlines ain&#8217;t exactly known &#8230; period.<br />
This was my first little apprehension. The plane was a Boeing 727-200. The chairs were so tightly packed that my knees were touching the seat in front of me. There was next to no room in the overhead compartments. It took nearly 45 minutes to get everyone on the plane. It was so tightly packed that a woman a couple of rows behind us had a panic attack and forced her way off the plane. I couldn&#8217;t blame her. As a direct result of her bailing out of the plane, the flight was delayed a further hour as they attempted to find her bag buried in the cargo hold. After over an hour and a half of waiting, we finally took to the air.<br />
Mental note to self: never fly anything except Canadian and Air Canada in the future. Canada 3000 as a last resort.<br />
On the plus side, we got free &#8220;sparkling wine&#8221; (a fancy way of saying that the wine they used wasn&#8217;t fit for peeling paint off walls), a reasonably decent meal (reconstituted chicked with unidentifiable green goop in the middle), and a pre-mixed salad that was not entirely unlike bad coleslaw. Real wine (someone&#8217;s joke of fermented grape juice) was available at that point. Liqueurs (brandy, schnapps, and some other harsh chemical) were served not longer after dinner. The guy sitting in the window seat kept talking to Allison, despite her heroic attempts to talk with me every chance she got &#8230; and took every chance to feel her up.<br />
The plane came to a rather rough bounce (kinda like when you skip stones across a pond) when we arrived. After walking most of the way across the Lower Mainland, we found our baggage carousel, and waited another 45 minutes for our lost luggage to be found. (For a while, we were wondering if the schmucks who took the luggage off in Toronto had forgotten to put it back on.)<br />
We didn&#8217;t get to Allison&#8217;s apartment until nearly 1:30am (Vancouver Time), where we promptly went to bed.<br />
This morning was rough. Ugly rough. The alarm went off at 7:30. We couldn&#8217;t pry ourselves out of bed until just after 8:00. I had a long list of things that I needed to do, and one of those things was an interview with Prologic Corporation (Allison&#8217;s company). It was time to play dress-up.<br />
We left the apartment just after 8:30. Allison dropped me off at a bus stop, so I could take a bus downtown. The ambient temperature was about 5-7 degrees, but the ambient humidity of about six trillion percent made it feel like two below zero.<br />
For the record: Vancouverites aren&#8217;t wimps. They may not be able to handle an Ontario winter, but I don&#8217;t think many Ontarioites can handle the kind of penetrating weather they have here.<br />
Upon arriving downtown, I made a valiant effort to contact the human resources manager at Prologic, to arrange the time for the interview (the time hadn&#8217;t been established by that point). The time was set for 2pm, so I had time to kill.<br />
I wandered down Davie St. trying to find the Vancouver Public Library. I needed to find a phone book (every single phone booth in Vancouver has had the phone book removed), so I could call the companies I had sent resumes to. Along the way, I found a McDonalds, and immediately called for breakfast.<br />
I began to notice the cold. I was wearing a dress-shirt, my sports jacket, and my slacks. I was cold. I decided that an overcoat wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad idea after all. Upon finding the Eaton&#8217;s store while trying to find the Library, I decided that a coat of some kind would be a good idea.<br />
That little task was repeated through most of the day. I don&#8217;t know what it is with people, particularly men&#8217;s fashions, but the cheapest raincoat I could find was $220. Hello?? Who buys a RAINCOAT for $220?? The most expensive one I found was over $1,000!! Who makes this stuff up?!<br />
Giving up on the raincoat issue for now (I had an umbrella for protection, and I wasn&#8217;t freezing to death), I found my way to the library. I checked up a couple of numbers, and decided that I should give myself a new challenge &#8212; find my way to Richmond, which is where Prologic has its offices.<br />
After polling a few bus drivers, I found the appropriate bus, and headed towards my interview. Allison had told me to get off the bus at Garden City and Cambie, where she would pick me up and bring me to Prologic. (The bus that ran from that corner to Prologic wasn&#8217;t exactly frequent.) I arrived at the corner about 45 minutes early, so I opted for lunch before calling Allison. Spying a 7-11 just down the road, I headed down to see what I could find.<br />
I walked into a small Italian pizzeria (which I would find out later was much more expensive than others in the area &#8212; I&#8217;m new to all this), and had a quick bite. Allison met me at the corner of Cambie and Garden City about a quarter to 2:00. She gave me a couple of quick pointers, and then sent me in to meet with destiny.<br />
While I waited for my first interviewer to appear, I quickly acquainted myself with some of Prologic&#8217;s literature on the desk &#8230; and the washroom. (Walking around in the penetrating chill had caused my bladder to swell somewhat.)<br />
When my first interview arrived, she took me to her office and started with the typical list of interview questions &#8230; except for the first: Why did you move to Vancouver?<br />
Then it was off to another building in the complex (Prologic has about 160 employees, and is growing at an unbelievable rate), usually referred to as &#8220;Second City&#8221;. (The third building is known as &#8220;Third Rock&#8221;.)<br />
There I was interviewed by the training manager, who wanted to know what kind of editing experience I had. Prologic needs an editor to work on some standards documents, and Allison thought I had the necessary anal retentiveness to make it work. (No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
I met with Allison after the interview, where she suggested I go to Oak Ridge Centre and wander around for a couple of hours before going back to her place. I would meet her at the entrance to Safeway so she could do some shopping. By the time she arrived, my feet were ready to abdicate from the rest of my body, and my shoulders had dropped two inches from carrying my laptop around all day.<br />
When we arrived back at her apartment, I made a hasty change, so we could go out to dinner. While we were getting ready the phone rang. It was Prologic calling to tell me they were willing to take me on. (It&#8217;s only a one-month contract, but considering I haven&#8217;t been here for 24 hours yet, I think it&#8217;s a good sign.) Following the call, we headed out for dinner.<br />
The restaurant of choice was &#8220;Naam&#8221;, a vegetarian (but thankfully, not vegan) restaurant in Kitsilano. Really good food, but it&#8217;s a little disconcerting to read a menu that has no meat on it whatsoever.<br />
And so my first day concludes on a decidedly upward note. There may be more long entries to following, depending on whether or not I want to write them.</p>

		<p>Dhar was up long before the rest of us. He took the time to wander around the neighbourhood, spooking my neighbours. Then he took the time to tell my father what mechanical difficulties we had. At around 09:00, Stefan, Rebecca, and I crawled out of the van and started to the mission of cleaning up the mess 10,000 kilometres had left.<br />
Our first problem was with our pressure sprayer &#8212; it was broken. This meant about an hour of strenuous scrubbing to try and get as many of the bug splats off as possible. We also plugged in the vacuum and went over every last scrap of carpet and fabric inside. The sink and burners were cleaned, any possessions removed, and Dhar&#8217;s car packed. By noon the mission was complete.<br />
Showers were not the order of the day, those came only after the van was washed. Even then Dhar opted to wait until he was home himself. Thus Dhar, Rebecca, and Stefan filed into Dhar&#8217;s Probe and vanished down the street. I immediately jumped in the shower. I was home.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960503.23</strong><br />
<em>Day 13</em><br />
It has finally ended. The Behemoth was washed this morning, Rebecca and Stef had showers (alone &#8211; a rarity in the last while), and then Dhar took them on their last leg home. I proceeded to get my pictures developed, and recant the trip to my family and friends.<br />
Tomorrow I must return to reality, something I&#8217;m not looking too forward to. But life must go on. Another road trip to P.E.I. may come up this summer, but that&#8217;ll be another story&#8230;

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By morning the rain had stopped, leaving cool damp weather in its wake. We stirred shortly after 08:30, all of us awake in a relatively short period of time. Our first surprise was to open the curtains and find that we were the only ones left in the entire campground. We didn&#8217;t know what time the others had left, but we had slept through all of them. It was fortuitous on our side &#8212; no waiting for showers, and it allowed Stefan to sneak into the women&#8217;s washroom with Rebecca.<br />
Horse Cave was the only KOA office I didn&#8217;t go into. Thus the last postcards I had sent were from Memphis the day before. Stefan cleared up the charges with the KOA while we packed away our gear and prepared for the morning trip. Once we had the financial portions squared away, all we had to do was pull up to the pumping station and dump the grey water tank.<br />
I must have been extremely irritating that morning, my incessant suggestions to go to Mammoth Cave must have severely worn away the levels of patience in my companions. But I won. Exiting the campground, we turned south on I-65 for about 12 miles until we reached the exit for Mammoth Cave National Park, for a lengthy drive westward.<br />
I had this odd preconception that the cave entrance would be somewhere near the Interstate, or at least the road into the park would be a fairly major one. I came to the conclusion after driving for 15 minutes that spelunking wasn&#8217;t as high on most tourists&#8217; lists as it was on mine. Impatience soon gave away to anticipation as we pulled into the large (and mostly deserted) parking lot.<br />
We grabbed what gear we thought necessary, and changed into clothes more suitable for the environment we were to experience. If nothing else, our visit to the Cave of the Winds had taught us that caves are cool places, and sandals aren&#8217;t the most appropriate footwear. Oddly enough, our lessons were learned differently by each of us: I wore shoes, a long sleeved shirt, and shorts; Rebecca and Stefan wore jeans, t-shirts, and sandals; Dhar wore jeans, t-shirt, and shoes. Each of us would complain about our choice of clothes during our voyage beneath the surface of the Earth.<br />
We walked across the parking lot to the Visitor&#8217;s Center to buy a tour ticket. Just outside the stone and wood building were a series of wood and plastic signs listing the tour options. There were four options available to us: a short 45-minute tour, two 2-hour tours, and a six hour extravaganza. We opted for one of the two tours, one that would give us the greatest view of the underground cave system.<br />
Mammoth Cave is the largest cave in the world, with over 336 miles (560 kilometres) of charted passageways. The route we decided on barely scratched the surface of massive cavern, only a measly couple of miles. It was the longest distance covered in a two-hour tour. I had read a great deal about Mammoth Cave, mostly about the local stories about it and surrounding caves, such as Crystal Cave and Onyx Cave. But today&#8217;s tour would be about the largest, Mammoth Cave.<br />
We walked in through the main entrance and walked over to the ticket booths. Only two of the half-dozen wickets were open, a sure sign of the pre-tourist season. We were two minutes too late, or so I thought. We very hastily bought our tickets, got very rudimentary instructions from the wicket clerk, then darted out the doors, hung a right, and charged down a path until we saw a large group of people with two National Park guides leading the way. We quietly joined at the end of the group.<br />
We seemed to have not missed anything, the guide at the front of the group was starting to tell the story of how the cave was formed, pointing to the geological structure of the area (mostly limestone, almost a prerequisite for forming a cave), the type of climate in south-central Kentucky, and the cave&#8217;s location to larger bodies of water. The guide also introduced himself (alas, I cannot remember his name) and his partner whom I believe was named Bill.<br />
Upon finding the group, we had started to walk into a ravine. The ravine had a path built in the middle of the floor for tour groups to gain easier access to the cave entrances. Our destination was called the Historic Entrance, and was the nearest to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. There were a few other entrances to the cave (probably because accessing those areas would require a several hour round-trip trek through the cave&#8217;s winding passages to get there), which appeared to be mostly elevators.<br />
We arrived at a large depression in the ground (possibly a shallow sinkhole), with a staircase running down the edge of the depression to the floor. Just before we started to descend, our more talkative guide (in fact, he was the only one who spoke during the entire two hours &#8212; I think Bill was there only so our primary guide never had to stop talking to turn the lights on and off, or keep an eye on the people in the rear) told everyone to &#8220;give your tickets to the most responsible person in your group, and then have her give them to me&#8221;. Unlike others in the tour group, we already knew who the most responsible person was.<br />
There were also a couple basic rules: stay with the group, and don&#8217;t remove anything from the cave. This included dirt, rocks, cave crickets, bats, fish, and retired Park Rangers. (Another dose of dry wit from our guide.)<br />
And so we started down the stairs, slippery with wear and water, which continually dripped from the upper lip of the hole. At the bottom we encountered a large steel bar gate covering the entrance. This was assumedly to keep unguided visitors from getting hopelessly lost inside (which was not an impossibility). The floor inside was dirt, but very tightly packed from millions of feet walking over it. Along the right side of the passageway was a tube of some kind, buried partly in the floor. About halfway down the 300 foot hall was scientific equipment, measuring the speed of the wind and its temperature.<br />
Like most large caves, Mammoth Cave &#8220;breathed&#8221; with the seasons. During the summer it exhaled and during the winter it inhaled. Winter having ended, the cave was beginning to exhale. The breeze was surprisingly stiff, about 10 km/h. It was also fairly cool. The inside of the cave was 54 degrees Fahrenheit (about 12 degrees Celsius), which almost immediately started my leg hairs to stand on end. I should have worn my jeans.<br />
We arrived at the first room on the tour, which I believe was called Grand Central Station or The Rotunda. Either way, the room was huge: at least 500 feet in diametre and 50 feet tall. Small lights (compared to the rest of the structure) gave off a slight glow which illuminated enough of the cave to see without flashlights or other extra lighting. The room was almost circular, with two large hallways extending further into the rock. The ceiling was domed in steps, formed when parts of the ceiling collapsed. The floor of the room was mostly dirt, but had several holes dug into it, like those of an archeological site.<br />
There was good reason for the holes. Our guide (I&#8217;ll leave Bill out of the picture, since he really didn&#8217;t do much) started into the history of the cave, covering the first few million years in about thirty seconds. The human history started with the Native Indians, who used to come into the cave to collect minerals such as gypsum. Then with the arrival of the Revolutionary War, the cave came into use again because it could provide the one thing the American colonies needed to defeat the British: salt peter.<br />
Long, straight trees were cut down and bored out with a long drill to form tubes. One end of the tubes was tapered, then butted with the flat end of another tube. This process was repeated over and over again until a long wooden pipe ran from outside the Historic Entrance to the middle of the room we were standing in. (This was the tube that we saw walking into the cave, still preserved in its location even after 200 years.) The water was used to leech the sodium nitrate from the soil, which was then dried out, collected, and hauled by cart to the surface. The sodium nitrate was then converted to potassium nitrate, which when mixed with charcoal and sulfur, became gunpowder.<br />
Our guide then told us that many historians believe that a huge amount of minerals were extracted from the cave during the Revolutionary War, something on the order of several thousand tons. I simply couldn&#8217;t fathom that amount of material being removed, and still seeing so much matter remaining. Our guide however, had his own theory &#8212; that amount was significantly lower.<br />
He explained that the mine (as it was referred to) existed for seven years from 1776 to 1783. During that time, it was possible to have extract the amount of material that the historians claimed was removed. The guide&#8217;s theory was based on accounts of several cave-ins, and massive tremors that kept just about everyone out for nearly four years. The amount of nitrates that could have been removed was therefore significantly lower.<br />
At that time, he indicated the holes in the floor of the room. The were remnants of the original mines left behind by the slaves and their overseers. The water tank that had once stood over them had since been destroyed. An iron railing around the holes kept people from walking into the pits.<br />
Finishing his speech, the guide then led us down the left hallway. The tunnel was about 50 feet in diametre, and dimly lit. The geologic history of the cave was covered in substantially more detail, including the past three cave-ins. I suddenly wondered just how stable the cave was, not wanting to be crushed under 20 tons of falling rock. But I wasn&#8217;t too keen on frightening anyone and kept my thoughts to myself.<br />
After a couple of stops and a long winding walk, we came to a small set of displays showing a few of the artifacts found in the cave. These included sandals and reed torches the Native Indians had used to explore the cave. Sadly, the original specimens were no longer available, due to theft which either led to the items being stolen or put away for safe keeping.<br />
It was then to pass around the Giant&#8217;s Coffin and into the cave requisite Fat Man&#8217;s Misery / Tall Man&#8217;s Agony. A short, narrow passageway that only a kid could love. This was a long one too, winding around until we entered into a keyhole-shaped tunnel, eventually landing us in another largish room. We were told that the restrooms we would see were mirages. Either lack of funding or broken equipment led to the toilets being taken out of service.<br />
This room was a crossroads for the cave. Here we could go up into the &#8220;upper&#8221; regions of that area of the cave, or go down to the lower areas where the cave fish and cave crickets lived. (Dhar had caught a brief glimpse of one in the dim light as we staggered through the previous passageway.) The room had been discovered about a century earlier by a black slave, who was a professional tour guide in the cave. He had entered the room from the same route as us, but the bottom of the keyhole had been filled in with rocks and debris at the time. The same slave had mapped most of the cave within an hour&#8217;s walk of the Historic Entrance.<br />
Another requisite of cave visitation soon arrived upon us: the lights were turned off. Urban dwellers can never know the feeling of having two of your senses shut off completely. When the lights go out, there is total blackness. An unlit night sky in the middle of the densest forest doesn&#8217;t even come close to the darkness achieved at 300 feet below the surface. It&#8217;s chillingly silent too, no-one spoke &#8230; I don&#8217;t think many breathed. For a full minute we were left in the isolation, and it&#8217;s a feeling not soon forgotten.<br />
With the lights back on a moment later, we continued into the upper regions of the cave. Up there it was much wetter than the other areas of the cave we had been in. Small streams flowed along the sides of the tunnels, heavy dripping echoed from all around, even the air felt damp.<br />
After a while we found ourselves in one of the showcase areas of the cave. Here was Bottomless Pit (in reality only a couple hundred feet, but with the lights off you&#8217;d never know), which we walked over on a catwalk. It was a long way to the bottom, at which we could see a light green pool of water. I tried to take a picture, but didn&#8217;t leave the exposure on long enough.<br />
We then entered Mammoth Dome, a room so tall it couldn&#8217;t have fit lengthwise in The Rotunda. Water fell constantly from the ceiling &#8212; everyone got a little wet regardless of where they stood. Flowstone coated the walls and created a few large formations at the rear of the room. From there we climbed a huge steel tower (erected when the cave came under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service), and exited through a tunnel at the top of the room.<br />
From there we walked through a few passageways until we entered another large tunnel, about the same size as the one we had gone down near the beginning of the tour. To our left was intense darkness, and a sign warning visitors not to wander down the tunnel without a guide. The path was rigged with motion sensors, used either to turn on the lights or warn Security.<br />
We headed right and continued along a long bend until we found ourselves in the right tunnel leading from The Rotunda. Here our guide thanked us for following the rules, and leaving the Park Rangers where we found them. We crossed the dirt floor of the immense room and went out through the entrance tunnel. I attempted to take an exposure picture of The Rotunda, but my lack of a tripod didn&#8217;t make for a clear picture.<br />
As we reached the cave entrance, a small bat joined the exodus. No bigger than a baseball glove (wingspan and all), the little fledermaus couldn&#8217;t get out through the steel bars without veering away and into the exiting group. A few people yelped in fright and tried to back away. I tried to get a good look at it without interrupting its flight plan. But soon we were in the warmth of the sun, and heading back to the ravine path.<br />
Once again our guide thanked us for the tour, we thanked him and Bill for their time. The guide suggested that he and Bill would be glad to share some stories of the cave if someone bought them lunch. I considered it for a moment, thinking of all the interesting information we could dig out of them. Instead the four of us returned to the Behemoth.<br />
It was time for lunch, and we were starving. We were out of breakfast food, and were about to polish off the last of all the food we had. We circled around the parking lot until we found one of the park roadways, then drove along until we found an open picnic site. Only two other vehicles were in the vicinity: one other family having lunch, and a few workmen renovating the washrooms nearby.<br />
It was lunch time. The barbeque came out to cook hot dogs, and the stove inside the van was turned on to cook the macaroni and cheese. It would be a fairly simple meal: President&#8217;s Choice White Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese Dinner, and a few hot dogs to go along. It wasn&#8217;t quite as basic as Kraft Dinner and wieners, but came reasonably close to being typical student fare.<br />
That was assuming of course, that one recognized it as such. But Dhar wasn&#8217;t a typical student. Dhar had never had anything like Kraft Dinner before. I stood there in silent awe. I had met a person who had never eaten something I would eat for weeks on end because it was the cheapest thing I knew of.<br />
Our lunch was nothing special, and we treated it no different than any other. The pot of macaroni and cheese quickly vanished, and the last of the hot dogs were eaten. When we were finished, the last of our food was gone. From then on, we would have to buy the rest of our meals. We cleaned the area up, disposing of the waste, packed up the barbeque, cleaned the dishes, and hit the road.<br />
Returning to the I-65, we entered the northbound lanes with Dhar behind the wheel. Next stop: we didn&#8217;t know. After Graceland, we had started to play the trip more by ear. Mammoth Cave had never been a suggestion until we had entered Mississippi State. Having left our last destination, we had no formal idea of where we were going, only that it was in the general direction of home.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960502.145</strong><br />
<em>Day 12</em><br />
The KOA was deserted when we woke up this morning. We then ventured to Mammoth Cave. Much more &#8220;natural&#8221; than Cave of the Winds &#8211; where the floors were cement, you couldn&#8217;t tell. It was cold inside, only 54 degrees F at best.<br />
Last night we had a long chat about a great many things, mostly about sex and relationships.<br />
We&#8217;re currently on our way north towards home. Don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re stopping next. Forgot to send Kathryn a postcard from Horse Cave / Mammoth Cave. Oh well&#8230;<br />
Hard to believe this trip is ending so soon. I don&#8217;t want to go back to life. I want to stay here where I don&#8217;t have responsibility except for myself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A sure sign of a good vacation is how much you don&#8217;t want to go home. None of us really wanted to. If we had the choice, I think we would&#8217;ve kept rolling as far as our credit limits would&#8217;ve allowed. Nevertheless, deep inside we were responsible and we knew that as much as we didn&#8217;t want to go, home was were we had to be. Maybe not so much with Dhar and I, but Eric and Thea were expecting their parents to return home from their trek across America.<br />
Around 16:00 we arrived in the Louisville area. Here we had to switch Interstates so we could continue in the proper direction. This necessitated a shift from I-65 to I-265, then to I-71. We stayed on I-71 for almost another two hours before arriving at I-75, which took us due north into Cincinnati, Ohio at around 18:00.<br />
I am a child of the 70&#8217;s &#8212; I grew up watching WKRP In Cincinnati. I remembered the opening theme, where the camera pans through the downtown core along one of the highways. It looked a little too urbanized, but it was my only impression of Cincinnati. I always had a desire to one day see the city, and try to spot the building that broadcasted Doctor Johnny Fever to the world (or at least the Greater Cincinnati area).<br />
Alas, it was not to be. The I-75 crossed to what looked like the west side of the city, and revealed nothing. We continued up I-75 until we reached I-275. By this point we&#8217;d figured out that we needed to be on I-71 again, which took us in a more northeasterly direction, more appropriate for our triumphant return to the Great White North. We traveled east on I-275 for six miles until joining up with I-71 to head northeast.<br />
About an hour after leaving the Greater Cincinnati area, our stomachs began to growl profusely again. It seemed time to feed the monsters within. Luckily for us, we were in a 30 mile stretch in the middle of southern Ohio that had no places to stop and buy dinner. We came across our salvation at a Shoney&#8217;s in Jeffersonville.<br />
Americans seemed to be obsessed with restaurant chains that mimic home cooking. I&#8217;ve been to several, and for some strange reason they all have pluralized names. We pulled up, tried to make ourselves look as presentable as possible, then sauntered in for our repast. Just inside the door awaited luscious desserts all waiting to be sampled. But sugar wasn&#8217;t high on my priority list at the time, I was more interested in something solid.<br />
We were led to a table by the hostess, and greeted by our waitress Christina a few moments later. It was now 19:30, and if nothing else the sounds emanating from our abdomens indicated that if we didn&#8217;t receive sustenance soon, we would start eating the table.<br />
Dhar seemed to have his head stuck in New Orleans, he ordered the seafood trio to calm his nerves. Likewise with Rebecca, who didn&#8217;t seem to get enough blackened red fish at CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon, she opted for the blackened cod. Stefan went for the charbroiled chicken, and I for an eight ounce sirloin steak. All of us took the salad bar option, we knew that no matter what we would get our money&#8217;s worth there.<br />
For the next 10 minutes we gorged ourselves on salads of all kinds. Then our entrees appeared. I couldn&#8217;t believe the speed at which our meals had arrived. I hadn&#8217;t had enough time to eat the second salad! I&#8217;ll tell you something: Shoney&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sacrifice quality for their speed &#8212; our meals were delicious. (Mind you, if the last meal was macaroni and cheese, nearly anything from a restaurant will be delicious.)<br />
It took less time to eat our entrees than it took us to park, make sure we weren&#8217;t disgusting, climb out of the van, and come into the restaurant. When Christina returned to ask what we thought of our meals, I caught the look of stifled astonishment to the speed our eating habits. Dessert went substantially slower, and only Rebecca and I indulged ourselves in that.<br />
Rebecca wanted coffee. I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d had coffee since the Perkins we went to in Kansas. She actually shook a little when she started drinking it, but soon the look of a devoted caffeine addict crossed her face and she slipped into her own little coffee coma. My kick at the cat came with an Oreo Cookie Sundae. This manifestation of evil was so loaded with sugar, I was wired until we reached Cleveland.<br />
At 20:00, we were back on board the Behemoth and heading northeast towards New York State. We could&#8217;ve saved some time and money by taking I-75 through Toledo and around the west end of Lake Erie. That would have not only returned us to Canada (and ultimately, home) much sooner, but avoided the toll booths in New York. But Niagara Falls was now on the agenda, no matter what time we got there. And so we drove.<br />
Sometime around 23:00 to 00:00 (and deep inside Ohio), we had to stop for gas &#8230; the Behemoth was running low. Wherever we were, it wasn&#8217;t heavily populated &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t seen much other than tree silhouettes for the past hour. We pulled into the cheapest station on the off-ramp and promptly set about refilling our tanks. I made a quick escape into the station to get some snack foods.<br />
Dhar was having a conversation with some of the local teens when I returned, two men and a slightly younger woman. They were at least 16 years old (looked closer to 18), as they were driving a Jeep pickup truck. I ignored the initial banter and climbed in through the side door to put my loot in the fridge to keep cool.<br />
The two men disappeared into the station store a moment later, and the woman came over to view the Behemoth. I quickly became interested in the conversation again. We invited her in, and asked her to excuse the general mess we had inside. She was just short of amazed at the vehicle we had in our possession. She was even more amazed when she found out whereabouts we had been in the last 11 days. She commented that she and her friends had similar aspirations, but didn&#8217;t know how they were going to go about doing it.<br />
Soon the two men returned to the truck, and the woman bounced out after them. Almost immediately Stefan and Rebecca jumped into the back, declaring that it was someone else&#8217;s turn to drive. Still wired from the Oreo Sundae, I volunteered and climbed behind the wheel. A moment later we were back on the I-71 heading for home.<br />
We had come to the realization that we were only five hours from home, and there wasn&#8217;t really anything along the way that we just had to see. It was a quick decision to make a last push for home. Even then, we still wouldn&#8217;t arrive until almost daybreak.<br />
About 30 miles outside Cleveland we broke from I-71 to I-271 to skirt around the outer edges of the city, eventually picking up I-90 on the eastern side. This took us along the south shore of Lake Erie through the rest of Ohio, into the 47 mile stretch of I-90 as it went through Pennsylvania, finally turning into the New York State Thruway once we crossed the state line.<br />
Despite the short distance we had to cover, Pennsylvania was a long state, due entirely to the conversation I had with Rebecca. I have no recollection how we got onto the topic, but we entered into a heated debate about definition. For those of you just joining us, Rebecca is an educated expert in women&#8217;s studies and sexuality. I&#8217;m an English major. Differences were bound to exist.<br />
We got onto a discussion of Freud (as in Dr. Sigmund, obsessed with possessing his mother). I personally don&#8217;t think very highly of Freud, I think he spent too much time relating everything to sex. (I don&#8217;t think he got laid very often.) Rebecca told me of one of Freud&#8217;s theories that said children are very sexual beings. At first I thought she said &#8220;sensual&#8221;, which I partly agreed to. &#8220;Sexual&#8221; on the other hand, I completely objected to that.<br />
Again, I repeat that I&#8217;m an English major. Hence, I know and follow dictionary meanings. I have this kooky perception that keeps me from inventing new definitions for words &#8212; otherwise our language gets too unwieldy and difficult to use (as if it already isn&#8217;t). &#8220;Sensual&#8221; I can understand because the word applies to the senses: kids touch and eat everything in sight, regardless of what it is. &#8220;Sexual&#8221; I disagree with because according to my dictionaries (mental and Random House) give no indication of definition outside of that pertaining to sex. In my opinion, children do not have, nor should participate in, sex.<br />
But I remind you, this is solely my opinion. Rebecca was all for using &#8220;sexual&#8221; as an adjective for children, comparing it with &#8220;sensual&#8221;. This she got from Freud. Again, I don&#8217;t think too highly of Freud. I think he needed to use a dictionary more often.<br />
New York was long and boring. The I-90 through New York is much like several Interstates that run through the middle of other states: there&#8217;s nothing on either side but trees. A little over an hour after entering the state, the Buffalo city limits sign whipped by our windows. What little exhaustion had started to creep into my system suddenly fled as the goal of our day rapidly appeared. It was after 03:00 and I&#8217;d been driving for over seven hours &#8230; the sight of home only made me want to drive all the more.<br />
We hit our first toll just after seeing the city limits sign. I griped about it silently, tossed in the toll, then sped on to the interchange for the I-190. Less than a quarter-mile into the I-190, another toll and another gripe. We headed due west until the I-190 curved north again to the Peace Bridge off-ramp. We entered the bridge toll area and drove up to one of the non-truck gates. All but the truck gate were closed for the night. We hastily backed up, crossed a few lanes, and scooted up to the truck booth. We paid our toll, and crossed the bridge to freedom.<br />
Upon entering New York State, we had taken the precaution of figuring out exactly how much stuff we had bought while on the trip. Dhar had won by a landslide, easily bringing back more stuff than the rest of us combined. But we were all under our personal limits. When we reached customs on the Canada side of the bridge, we were ready for any question.<br />
&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said the Customs clerk. He was a man in his 30&#8217;s, with a black mustache and hair.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Evening!&#8221; I replied, a little too cheerily.<br />
&#8220;Where are you folks coming from?&#8221; he asked.<br />
&#8220;All over the United States. Just finishing a 12 day tour.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I see. Everyone in there Canadian?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yessir!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Who&#8217;s all in there?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Uh, me, her, him, and him!&#8221;<br />
(Okay, so we were ready for all the questions except who we were. Let&#8217;s face it, after that long together, I think just about anyone would have a tough time figuring out who they were.)<br />
&#8220;Names?&#8221; The clerk wasn&#8217;t amused at my blunder. We quickly dug out our birth certificates and drivers licenses.<br />
&#8220;Anything to declare?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Nope!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Welcome home.&#8221;<br />
We were home. Almost immediately I felt like someone had just put a warm wool Hudson&#8217;s Bay blanket around me and handed me a cup of hot maple syrup. We drove onto the QEW and started towards Oakville. We drove to Highway 420, which we then took to downtown Niagara Falls so we could get a look at the Falls, even though it was 04:00 in the morning. Along the way we stopped at a Country Time donut shop to grab a quick snack. It was such a relief to taste a Canadian donut again (even if it wasn&#8217;t from Tim Horton&#8217;s).<br />
Downtown Niagara Falls was utterly dead. The entire time we were there, I only saw one other car on the road (not counting the two cop cars, those were expected). The night lights on the Falls were off, I had assumed they stayed on all night. Much to my disappointment, they didn&#8217;t. All we could see was a dark wall, the mist in the air, and water on the road where the mist fell. We made two passes and headed back out to the QEW.<br />
This part I could nearly do in my sleep. I hadn&#8217;t driven it too many times, but the route was very familiar to me. We passed over the Welland Canal, through St. Catherines, through Grimsby (which many of my friends testify that it&#8217;s a gateway to another dimension), past Hamilton, over the Burlington Skyway, through Burlington, and into Oakville.<br />
As we neared the off-ramp for Trafalgar Road, I suddenly came to the shocking realization that I didn&#8217;t have a house key. We would have to sleep in the Behemoth one more night. I pulled onto Trafalgar Road, and headed south to Cornwall Road. I took this east to Maplegrove Road, then south again to Devon Road. East briefly to Pinehurst Road, south to Gatestone Avenue, and parked right behind my father&#8217;s van at 05:45. We quickly unpacked the sleeping bags and passed out.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Arriving at a quarter to five in the morning, we have finally ended our tour around the continent. Unfortunately we must still camp a night as I do not have the house keys.The border crossing was interesting &#8211; when asked who was in the van, I replied: &#8220;Me, her, him, and him.&#8221; But we had no other problems. We even saw some of the Falls. It&#8217;s good to be home.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Little kids sounded the morning knell, much like how an air raid siren warns of impending disaster. I&#8217;m not suggesting that we had a bad day, but it&#8217;s not exactly the way I&#8217;d wanted to start it off. Our waking patterns were reestablished that morning: Dhar first, soon followed by me, then Rebecca, and Stefan some time later. The morning was not nearly as cool as the night had been, the sun had come out and started warming the air.<br />
In the daylight we got our first good look at the camp. It was similar to the one we had stayed at in Colorado Springs: no attempts to spruce it up at all. But this particular KOA didn&#8217;t even have the beauty of nature to fall back on. There was no creek, no view of mountains, no feeling of isolation. A Days Inn lay between us and Elvis Presley Boulevard, and a high wooden fence was erected behind us.<br />
The morning shower ritual was enacted, our regular runs to the KOA office for postcard duties and post-registration performed, all pretty much to schedule and rhythm. Except the post-registration. That particular KOA wasn&#8217;t a very well-managed one. The esthetics of the camp were obviously not of any concern, nor was the fair treatment of the guests. We had parked in a site that had no hook-ups of any kind, thus we were supposed to pay only for a site of that type. However, so the staff claimed, we had an RV, which automatically meant we had to pay for a hook-up site. Stefan did not give into that kind of logic, and argued with them for at fifteen minutes before they finally caved in and charged us only for a basic site. It became brutally obvious that the KOA had only been built to service visitors to Graceland, with no concern for anything other than profit.<br />
Our breakfast was the last of the donuts. Still cold, still sticky-sweet, they were still good. The plan of the day was simple: visit Graceland, and cover more distance heading home. Stefan and I had originally not wanted to be home too early, but Stefan had also said he wanted to be home on the Saturday (it was a Wednesday on that date) so we also wanted to make sure that we were within striking distance of home.<br />
Hitting the road took only a few minutes that morning &#8212; not having to unhook the Behemoth from the utilities takes a great deal of time off your clock. We turned right to head further south on Elvis Presley Boulevard. In only a few moments we had arrived at the Home of the King. On our left was the legendary estate, on our right the visitor&#8217;s parking and other museums that were parts of the Graceland tour.<br />
The parking lot had only a quarter of the 300+ spots filled. For us, this was a good sign because it meant that once again we had skirted the crowds &#8212; a big plus for Dhar. As we headed to what we assumed was the main entrance, we passed a few people wearing Elvis t-shirts heading towards their vehicle. We were entering a dimension beyond sight and sound &#8230; just around that bend: The Elvis Zone.<br />
The ticket lobby was almost deserted. In the middle of &#8220;tourist season&#8221;, this room would probably be packed with avid Elvis fans (the kind whom I wanted to avoid). Immediately on the left of the doors was a bank machine. Realizing that my $100 from Las Vegas had almost run out, I opted to make another $100 withdrawal before doing anything else.<br />
By the time I got to the ticket wicket with my newly acquired cash, the others had already bought their tickets. When I bought mine, not only did I get a second ticket (explained in a moment), but I ended up on a different tour number! Mildly annoyed at this, I was told that the tour number really didn&#8217;t matter. I assumed that the numbering system only really came into play during the heavier visitor days.<br />
Now for the second ticket business. We bought access to all the exhibits available, a total of five venues: the Graceland mansion, the Automobile museum, an personal items collection, a 15 minute movie about Elvis, and the Lisa Marie. Normally all these are printed on the same ticket, which has five tear-off portions. The ticket clerk made a mistake however and had to print me two tickets.<br />
While I was purchasing my tickets, Dhar was trying to withdraw $100 from the bank machine in the lobby &#8230; without success. I wanted to tell him he wasn&#8217;t going to have any luck no matter where we went, but I figured he didn&#8217;t want to hear it. Besides, he still had a fair bit of Canadian money he could exchange at a bank.<br />
We exited through the &#8220;front doors&#8221; (we had come in through the &#8220;side doors&#8221;) to the departure station, where a tour guide tore off the mansion ticket and handed us a pair of headphones and a small black box about the size and weight of a small car. I had thought the tour would be guided by the Graceland staff. But things were done a bit differently there &#8212; the black box was a rudimentary cassette player that took visitors on a 45 minute tour of the Graceland mansion. The idea was fairly simple: follow the cues and you&#8217;ll hear things in sync with the voices.<br />
We boarded the small bus that would ferry us across Elvis Presley Boulevard and up to the front doors of the mansion. Just before leaving, the guide told us to turn the cassette players on. I did so, and started listening to the calming male voice that welcomed us to Graceland. I made a judgment mistake though, believing the voice asked us to keep the players off until we were inside Graceland. This put me five minutes behind everyone else for a while.<br />
Reaching the top of the hill upon which the mansion sat, we disembarked and followed the tour guides&#8217; directions into the house. To say the least, I wasn&#8217;t prepared for what lay within the doors. The first thing we saw upon entering was a staircase about 15 feet from the doorway. This ran up to the second level of the house, closed to visitors. (I know, &#8220;Oooooh! A staircase!&#8221; But that&#8217;s the point &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t some grand balustrade, it was just an ordinary set of stairs.)<br />
The Voice directed us to our right, towards the Piano Room. It was so called because of the piano at the far end. (He may have been the King, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he was terribly original.) The room was about 15 feet wide and 30 feet long, divided partially in the middle with a pair of brightly coloured stained glass peacock windows. The colour scheme in the room was mostly white, with several gold accents on the walls, ceiling, piano, and on the couches.<br />
The Voice then directed us to the stairway that we had seen on our way in. We were told that Elvis used to give karate demonstrations there for his guests. For a brief flash, I honestly thought I could see Elvis doing just that. It was then that I came to know the reason why so many people return to Graceland: it&#8217;s real. Not a museum piece, not a recreation &#8230; this was how Elvis had lived, this was where his life was lived out for two decades. The decorations, the carpet, the design of the grounds &#8230; everything came from his mind, undiluted with time or renovations.<br />
Again The Voice turned us to the left to see the Dining Room, opposite to the Piano Room. It wasn&#8217;t a very large room, maybe 20 feet square. The table had places for about half a dozen people. Two large televisions were in opposite corners of the room. The Voice suddenly gave way to Priscilla Presley, Elvis&#8217; widow. She began to tell us about some of her memories of her life at Graceland, living with the King. She would do so several times during the tour.<br />
I had a problem with Priscilla, but it wasn&#8217;t anything to do with her marriage to Elvis, or her current life. It was her little speeches &#8230; they were all fake. I will be one of the first to say that Priscilla isn&#8217;t the world&#8217;s foremost actress. She does wonderful dead-pan comedy, particularly next to the King of Dead-pan (Leslie Nielsen), but drama isn&#8217;t her forte. I could tell within seconds that she was reading off a script:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Voice:</strong> Priscilla Presley tells us of her life at Graceland&#8230; (The Voice and music fades out)<br />
<strong>Priscilla:</strong> Elvis loved having people over for dinner, usually with the guys. (Speaks reminiscently) He&#8217;d sit at the head of the table and tell some of the funniest stories you ever heard. (Laughs slightly) (Slight pause) He was kind, caring man&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This annoyed the hell out of me. I don&#8217;t know if it was Priscilla who wrote the script, or Graceland Enterprises for the purposes of the tour. Either way, it was not they method I would have used to illicit a portion of the tour from the widow of the King. The best method, in my humble opinion, would have been to take Ms. Presley on a tour of the house in the same order as visitors, and have her tell unprompted stories as she went. Edit the voice cuts later on and splice into the tour tape. The scripting of the stories nearly ruined the tour for me.<br />
From the Dining Room we passed into the kitchen, added to the tour only after Elvis&#8217; aunt had died a year earlier &#8212; she used to spend all her time in the kitchen. Although I had never truly thought about it before, I had an expectation of a huge kitchen with a huge fridge, giant counters for use by a team of expert chefs, coloured completely stark white and gleaming chrome.<br />
If there is any room that speaks more about a person than any other, it&#8217;s got to be the kitchen. It was small, 10 feet wide about 20 feet long. Wooden cabinets, deep brown carpeting, and standard appliances. It was the same kitchen you could expect to see in just about anyone&#8217;s home, there wasn&#8217;t anything special about it. Stepping into this man&#8217;s kitchen, all my views of this eclectic, mysterious, phenomenal man all came crashing to the ground &#8212; Elvis was no different than anyone else, he just led a more extraordinary life than most.<br />
Around a corner and down the stairs, we arrived in the TV Room, so named for the three televisions set into the far wall. The colour scheme was mostly yellow (my sister swore upon seeing the pictures that Elvis was colourblind), with two couches, a glass table, a wet bar, and a small ceramic monkey in the centre of the table. The TVs were the result of Elvis hearing that then-President Johnson watched two at a time.<br />
Walking back out of the door, we crossed the staircase hall into the Pool Room. About 15 feet square, the room had only one purpose, the pool table that sat proudly in the middle. But the table wasn&#8217;t what caught my eye &#8212; it was the 2,000 feet of multi-coloured fabric that was pleated all over the walls. Gaudy to some, I actually rather liked the idea (though cleaning it must be a big problem). The Voice mentioned that a tear on the table (which I hadn&#8217;t noticed until The Voice drew my attention to it) was caused by one of the &#8220;Memphis Mafia&#8221; (how Elvis&#8217; entourage was often referred to) .<br />
We then exited the Pool Room through another door, passing through a small non-descript room, and up a flight of stairs into the Jungle Room. The name came from the decor of the room, which included a fountain on the left wall, deep pile green carpeting on the floor and the ceiling (oh, the styles of the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s), and the most hideous-looking furniture I have ever seen in my life.<br />
The Voice told the story of how Elvis purchased the furniture. He was apparently walking through downtown Memphis one day, and happened to see the chair and a couple of couches sitting in the display window of a furniture store. He loved them so much, he bought the entire set and had it shipped to Graceland immediately. The couch was so big the windows had to be removed to move it inside. Why he bought the set, I don&#8217;t know: the fabric alone is reason enough to worry about Elvis&#8217; decorating sense &#8212; it&#8217;s brown and beige zebra-striped fake fur. It&#8217;s ghastly.<br />
The Jungle Room has the fame of being the site of Elvis&#8217; last recording session. His last album was recorded in the Jungle Room, and was released just before he died on August 16, 1977. I was five years and one month old on that day, and I remember my mother being rather shocked at the news. Being so young, the event passed by me without notice.<br />
We then progressed out the back door into the back yard of the mansion. We walked under a large roof (where I assume Elvis parked his cars, since I couldn&#8217;t see a garage anywhere) to an office building about 100 feet away from the house. As we crossed the short expanse, The Voice told us of Elvis&#8217; passion of driving his converted snowmobiles (becoming grass-mobiles during the spring and summer months) around the yard, which often scared his daughter Lisa-Marie half to death. Elvis also enjoyed games of firecracker tag with the Memphis Mafia, shooting roman candles at each other.<br />
In the office (on prompting from The Voice) we watched a short news reel that had been taken in the office when Elvis had returned from his stint in the Army. The office had been his father&#8217;s, and was left almost in the same manner that it had been in when Elvis died. Adjacent to the office was a small shooting range Elvis used from time to time.<br />
We then proceeded along another concrete path towards another building. The Voice told us of the Presley&#8217;s love of horses. Several horses were on the Graceland grounds, but no-one mentioned whether or not they were the original residents. The Graceland grounds were suitable for horses, the back yard was at least the length of a football field, and possibly the same distance in width.<br />
The next building was a small museum, carrying visitors from The King&#8217;s humble start, right to his last performance. The first room was the beginning of it all, Elvis&#8217; start in the early 50&#8217;s and all the trouble he got himself into with that dynamic pelvis. Misunderstanding a cue, I turned my tour cassette off and ended up having to wander about in the room much longer than I wanted to just so I could catch up (there was no &#8220;fast forward&#8221; button).<br />
The next room was known as the &#8220;Hall of Gold&#8221;, and contained every award Elvis had ever won. Ten feet wide and 50 or 60 feet long, the blue passage glittered with gold records on both sides. At the very end of the hall was an enormous plaque Elvis had received for all the money and time he had donated to various charities in the Memphis area. Elvis was one of the last great performers who regularly gave back to his community. Today&#8217;s Gen-X musicians would never consider such deeds &#8212; they&#8217;re either too absorbed in themselves or too desperate to die.<br />
At the end of the &#8220;Hall of Gold&#8221;, I (now separated from Dhar and from Stefan and Rebecca) entered another portion of the museum, which picked up where the first room had left off. More history of Elvis, starting with his Army uniform. Various pieces of fan mail, posters and costumes from his movies, a huge painting, the one and only Gold Lamay suit, the black leather outfit from his televised comeback special, the Eagle suit from his Hawaii concert, his karate jumpsuit and his black belt, and his police badge collection. All around was his famous &#8220;TCB&#8221; logo, stylized with a lightning bolt. It stood for: &#8220;Taking care of business in a flash.&#8221;<br />
Then it was out the door and across another concrete pathway to another building in the yard. This was originally a racquetball / squash court, but was now another museum to his many album sales records. But the focal point of the building wasn&#8217;t the glittering wall at the far end, it was the piano that sat behind the protective glass wall. It was there that Elvis played his last song, on the evening of August 15, 1977. Feeling a little tired, he rested awhile before going to bed. The next morning Elvis was found dead, the morning he was supposed to start his next tour.<br />
By this point I had caught up with Dhar, who had stopped his tape a while ago in hopes the rest of us would catch up. Dhar had become rather bored with the tour and had flipped the cassette tape over and rewound part of the tape (there was a &#8220;review&#8221; button), in effect fast forwarding through part of the tape. The two of us then exited through the side door and walked over to the Meditation Garden.<br />
The Meditation Garden is the final resting place of Elvis Aaron Presley &#8230; for those who believe he&#8217;s dead. Elvis&#8217; mother, father, and grandmother all rest there as well. There&#8217;s even a memorial plaque to Elvis&#8217; stillborn twin brother. According to The Voice, flowers arrive continually all year long (with significant increases on Elvis&#8217; birthday and on the anniversary of his death), and are left until the real flowers wilt and the fake ones look weather-beaten.<br />
The tour ended at that point, and Dhar and I shared a quiet moment staring at the quiet grave. But for me, there was something more to the mansion &#8212; there was a spirit there. I don&#8217;t know if it was Elvis, or just the essence of who and what he was. But you could feel there was something there, watching you, welcoming you, wanting to tell you all there was to know, saying good-bye as you left. In the Memorial Gardens, that spirit is most strongly felt.<br />
Rounding the swimming pool at the side of the mansion, we walked around to the front to pick up our bus back to the other side of Elvis Presley Boulevard. There we finally got our first good look at the house. Despite all that we had seen, it didn&#8217;t look all that different than many of the houses in my home town. It wasn&#8217;t huge, but sat on a very large lot. It looked comfortable, and undoubtedly was. It was a home someone was proud to have owned.<br />
The bus ferried us back to the rest of the Graceland attractions. There we returned our tour cassette players, and started to view the rest of the museums. The first in our list was Elvis&#8217; automobile collection. Elvis loved his cars &#8212; he had a lot of them.<br />
Entering the museum (and having another ticket torn off), we walked around a corner to the first part of the collection: a series of motorcycles and tricycles Elvis once drove. While I was taking a picture, one of the other visitors decided that he would try his luck at touching a piece of Elvis &#8230; and set of the security alarm. It seemed that all the vehicles in the exhibits had a grounded security system, the slightest touch set it off. The man jerked upright, slightly shocked, and hastily walked away. A security guard rounded a corner a moment later, looked around, then went back out front.<br />
In front of a large wall of lights that curved over-top was an Astin-Martin, the kind of car that James Bond used to drive (before he switched to a BMW). The lights bounced beautifully off the shiny black car, making an interesting view.<br />
In the middle of the main portion of the museum was a replica drive-in theatre (complete with removed front seats from cars) where a 15 minute looping movie of the cars in Elvis&#8217; movies played. I caught glimpses of it, but never watched the whole thing.<br />
One of the vehicles from Elvis&#8217; movies was the pink jeep from Blue Hawaii. It&#8217;s tacky, it&#8217;s pink, and it&#8217;s the kind of thing that seemed to prevail though many movies of that period. It was also, sadly, a fake. According to a plaque in front of it, a previous visitor had pointed out that the original jeep was either destroyed or bought by someone else, Elvis had bought a replica.<br />
One of the most ugly cars in his collection was a Stutz Blackman, built by the Stutz Motor Company. It&#8217;s striking lines and very angled shape leads to a very displeasing car to look at &#8212; as my friend Scott put it, a very 70&#8217;s look. Like it&#8217;s name, the car was black &#8230; so black you couldn&#8217;t tell where the edges of the car were.<br />
I think Elvis had a penchant for pink vehicles &#8212; a pink Cadillac was also on display. But not his pearl and gold Cadillac. A sign put on one side indicated that the well-known limousine was on permanent display at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville. Then it was into a small gift shop, the theme centering around the automobile collection.<br />
The next museum contained more items from Elvis, mostly of a more personal nature. These included Lisa Marie&#8217;s crib and baby clothes, Elvis&#8217; desk and pens, a couple chairs, some clothes, and one of the lamps from the 70&#8217;s redecoration. According to an accompanying sign, the lamp was all that remained of the last redecoration before Elvis died: red shag carpets on the floors, walls, and ceiling; the gaudy gold lamps; essentially outrageous things that most sane people wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead with today. When Graceland had been set up for a tourist attraction, the decor was reverted to one that had been in place in the 60&#8217;s. Then it was through another gift shop.<br />
Outside the temperature was warm, without being uncomfortable. We were all a little tired from all the walking and viewing, and above all we were hungry. But we also wanted to get through the rest of the attractions and hit the road so we could go to a bank and get Dhar some American funds.<br />
The next stop was the movie, which was a brief history of Elvis&#8217; early years and the philosophy of life he had. Then it was through another gift shop.<br />
Our final stop was at the Lisa Marie, one of Elvis&#8217; two private planes. Northwest Airlines had their grubby little fingers in this affair, setting up a mock check-in counter. You also had to pass through an Elvis Fan Detector (in the style of a normal airport metal detector). On the walls of the &#8220;pre-flight lounge&#8221; were various bits of trivia about the use of the Lisa Marie, including the details on Elvis&#8217; notorious middle-of-the-night flight to Denver for peanut butter sandwiches.<br />
The Lisa Marie was a Convair 880 built in 1958 by General Dynamics. Elvis bought the plane in 1975 and gave it an $800,000 dollar makeover to suit his needs. (Elvis&#8217; second plane, a Lockheed JetStar, cost him nearly $900,000 and was less than half the size of the Convair.) Elvis named the plane after his daughter, and designated it 880EP.<br />
Both planes are permanently grounded, the engines removed and the avionics disabled. One of the Lisa Marie&#8217;s engines sat over to one side for visitors to view. The others were donated to high schools and technical institutes to assist students in learning to build jet engines.<br />
Dhar and I looked at the JetStar first, which Elvis called &#8220;Hound Dog Two&#8221; (the Lisa Marie was &#8220;Hound Dog One&#8221;). Compared to its much larger companion, it wasn&#8217;t worth the look. Stefan and Rebecca however, had to see for themselves. Dhar and I waited at the foot of the Lisa Marie&#8217;s stairs for Stefan and Rebecca to join us.<br />
We climbed the steps and stepped through the forward hatch. To our left was the cockpit, shielded by a sheet of Plexiglas. To our immediate right was the forward bathroom (similarly shielded), complete with brass taps and a gold-flecked sink. Just beyond that was the first compartment. This was primarily chairs with a single coffee table on the left hand side. A TV at the side of the room repeated stories and information about that compartment of the plane. All the furniture was leather, but covered in plastic.<br />
The next room was the conference room. This had a long conference table, surrounded by ten leather chairs. Here too all the items had plastic covers &#8230; assumedly so visitors wouldn&#8217;t destroy the valuable museum piece. Lisa Marie Presley held her seventh birthday party at that table. Just beyond the table was one of the first air-phones, which Elvis had installed for his use.<br />
The conference room, like the other two rooms, had a large TV in it. The plane also had a videocassette player, which Elvis used to watch movies. I was really surprised (and oddly proud) to discover that Elvis and I shared a common liking of certain movies. Among his favourites were Mel Brooks&#8217; Blazing Saddles, and Monty Python&#8217;s Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br />
The last compartment of the plane was Elvis&#8217; bedroom. A queen-sized bed occupied most of the space (also covered in plastic), complete with an FAA-standard seat belt across the middle of the bed. The tail section bore the bathroom, similar but larger to the forward bathroom, and included a shower. Then it was out through the rear hatch and down the stairs to the tarmac.<br />
We entered our last gift shop a moment later, on our way out of the Graceland attractions. As we entered into the shop from the Lisa Marie, we saw a desk to one side with a collection of cookbooks on display. They were written by Elvis&#8217; uncle Vester. A mannequin sat behind the desk, a likeness of Uncle Vester. At least I thought it was a mannequin &#8230; until I saw it move.<br />
I nearly jumped out of my skin. So did Dhar. For a moment, I had to stare at the sickly-looking old man to make sure that he was in fact human, and alive. Sure enough, ol&#8217; Uncle Vester was sitting behind the desk, peddling his cookbooks to anyone who cared enough to step forward and pick up a copy. I say &#8220;cared&#8221; because you couldn&#8217;t help feel sorry for the man &#8212; you really had to wonder if he wanted to be there. I&#8217;ve seen dogs with their tails between their legs look more chipper than this poor man. He just sat there, looking blanking forward not noticing a soul, looking like he was waiting for death.<br />
After a few minutes, we finally returned to the Behemoth and prepared to move out. As we passed by Graceland, I waved a mental good-bye, knowing that one day I would return. It was time for us to turn our view to the next task at hand. Rebecca had gone to the trouble of asking for the nearest bank so we could get Dhar&#8217;s Canadian funds changed into American. That required a further trip south to a local Savings and Loan. Dhar ran in while the rest of us waited. A few minutes later he ran back out, shaking his head.<br />
The bank wouldn&#8217;t exchange it &#8230; rather, couldn&#8217;t exchange it. Apparently, Canadian funds were treated like funny money that far south, and your average bank couldn&#8217;t handle the transfer. (Stupid banks.) But the First National Bank of Tennessee was supposedly capable. So on the directions Dhar gave me, given to him by one of the bank clerks, we headed still further south on Elvis Presley Boulevard in search of greenbacks.<br />
But even the First National Bank of Tennessee couldn&#8217;t do it. I couldn&#8217;t believe that we were so far from home that everyone was completely incompetent at such a simple task. But when you deal with a hundred small banks instead of a few large ones, problems happen.<br />
Fortunately one of us was thinking that afternoon, and struck upon the idea that the airport might be able to do the exchange. We had reached the point where any idea was worth trying, so made our way north on Elvis Presley Boulevard to Winchester Road. We headed east until we found signs to point us towards Memphis International Airport&#8217;s terminal.<br />
After enough loops and turns to get anyone hopelessly lost, I pulled up in front of the terminal, and Dhar took off to find the exchange counter. Rebecca and Stefan followed suit, although I&#8217;m not sure if they went for the same reasons as Dhar. I sat there, hoping that some ticket-happy airport cop wouldn&#8217;t decide to fulfill his quota that afternoon.<br />
After five minutes, any fears I had were squashed when the three of them emerged from the terminal, all smiles and sunshine. It was mission accomplished, and time for us to hit the Interstate. Following more signs, more turns and bends, I eventually found our way to I-240, which would take us out to I-40, our roadway to Nashville so we could take I-65 north.<br />
But like so many well-laid plans, we had problems &#8230; traffic. No, not rush hour traffic, construction traffic. And was it heavy! A dead snail could move faster than we did. We only needed to cover two to three miles until the traffic cleared up, but that alone took nearly 45 minutes. When the traffic did finally clear up, we gunned the engine and made some distance between us and the traffic, even though the construction zone extended nearly all the way to the I-40 turn-off.<br />
Once we were on I-40, everything became smooth sailing. But we were hungry. All our touring that morning and into the afternoon had left us rather famished. The great discussion of what to eat engaged again, and for nearly 15 minutes we pulled for our personal choices. Finally, Rebecca&#8217;s craving for chicken won out, and we stopped just outside Jackson for Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
I am convinced KFC was not discovered by Colonel Sanders, but by the Devil himself. It&#8217;s the only theory that makes some sense to me. Think about it: how else can something taste so good, yet be so disgustingly greasy. Everyone I know readily admits that KFC is greasy &#8212; you can almost wring it out with your hands, if it was possible to get a grip on it. Yet everyone gets cravings for it every so often. I do, but I try not to eat the stuff because the thought of all that grease makes me sick to my stomach.<br />
It had been nearly three years since the last time I had eaten Kentucky Fried Chicken, and my memories of that experience were none too pleasant. Yet when I stepped inside the restaurant doors, the craving started. And it got worse with every microsecond I stood waiting for someone to buy the chicken. The next thing I knew, I had bought into the bucket of chicken, and was anxiously awaiting our meal. But first we had to find a rest stop.<br />
Just our luck: we had nearly 30 miles until the next rest stop came up. We found a nice picnic table (complete with a small roof), took out our bucket of greasy chicken, a pile of paper towels, and promptly started messily masticating our meal. I started feeling kind of ill after a while, the grease was overwhelming. I had it all over my hands and on a good portion of my face. I don&#8217;t know how I did that, but it always seemed to happen when eating KFC.<br />
All but four pieces were eaten. I swore then and there never to eat KFC again, for fear of turning into a giant zit. We threw out the remains of our chicken saving the last four pieces for a later date. Then it was back onto the van to continue our push north.<br />
Our plans had pretty much broken down by this point, we really didn&#8217;t have any idea where we were going. I wanted to see Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, since the route we were planning to take (the only thing we knew for certain) went right by the National Park. But what we hadn&#8217;t planned was where (if anywhere) we were going to stop. Nashville was ruled out about two minutes before we entered the city limits, we couldn&#8217;t think of any reason to stop that interested us. There we left I-40 for I-65.<br />
After enough goading on my part, I convinced someone to stop at Horse Cave, which had the nearest KOA to Mammoth Cave National Park. This, unfortunately, meant that our next (and last, as it turned out) KOA stop would be a late check-in, which Stefan absolutely hated doing by that time. I couldn&#8217;t blame him. Trying to figure out those wretched forms at that time of night was never a good thing.<br />
Just outside of Nashville, Rebecca got into another one of her talkative moods, and tried to strike up conversation by asking questions. Now remember what Rebecca is like. She doesn&#8217;t ask normal questions. No, she has to ask things like: &#8220;Do you love you parents?&#8221; &#8220;Who would your ideals parents be?&#8221; These were the questions that I responded to, because the earlier ones were ones I tried to avoid.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960501.175</strong><br />
<em>Day 11</em><br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee, I&#8217;ve been to Graceland &#8230;&#8221;<br />
All my illusions of Elvis have been shattered. Walking through a person&#8217;s home tells a lot about a person. We didn&#8217;t get to see the red shag and gold lamp decor, but what we did see spoke volumes. I actually thought I could see him wandering about as I walked his halls. There&#8217;s a spirit there, and it&#8217;s oddly welcoming.<br />
We traveled through the mansion listening to a pre-recorded audio tour, then onto the car museum, personal effects, a short movie, and his airplanes. I found it interesting that he and I shared a similar taste in movies.<br />
After a rather nasty traffic jam (following a run to the airport), we stopped for KFC (a bad idea, if you ask me). Rebecca&#8217;s currently asking us questions like: &#8220;If you could be born to different parents, would you?&#8221;, and &#8220;What one thing in your life would you say defines who you are?&#8221; Next step &#8211; who knows?<br />
Almost forgot &#8211; Elvis&#8217; uncle Vester was waiting for us when we returned from the tour of the Lisa Marie. He was selling cook books. Never before have I seen such a sullen man.<br />
Also discussed relationships &#8211; why is it so hard to have a simple relationship? Why do I always reach comfortable friendship so fast?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither Dhar, nor Stefan, nor myself had any complaints about our parents. The three of us had led childhoods we were proud of, with many fond memories and nothing we truly regretted. Rebecca&#8217;s childhood, on the other hand, wasn&#8217;t all fun and games. Her parents divorced, her father isn&#8217;t exactly what she (or I, for that matter) would call &#8220;role model material&#8221;, and she had a less-than-loving environment. This brought up the next round of questions: ideal parents.<br />
This was a question I honestly didn&#8217;t know how to answer. All along I believed that my parents would have been an ideal choice, assuming I had the luxury of choosing the ones I wanted. They gave me freedoms most of my friends didn&#8217;t have, taught me the ways of life, tried to get me to do extracurricular activities so that I wouldn&#8217;t be socially inept. (Okay, so they went about it a little half-assed, but I still think I turned out okay &#8230; &#8216;course, I&#8217;m still single &#8230; I&#8217;m a geek &#8230; hmm, maybe I need to think about this a little more.)<br />
Rebecca&#8217;s ideal parents would be Cher or Madonna, and Donald Trump. Although Rebecca didn&#8217;t have those people as her parents, in a strange way you could see it as being true. Rebecca has Cher&#8217;s independence and strength to keep going on (not to mention a healthy dose of sex appeal), but also Trump&#8217;s tenacity to get things done and not give a damn what someone else says about what she does.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t answer Rebecca&#8217;s question about defining moments, though I did think long and hard about it. My last couple years of high school were probably the most formative for me, at least in respects to the person I am now, but no one single point took me in the ultimate direction I&#8217;m headed now. My defining points have all been like course corrections, steering me through the straits of depression, the mountains of joy, the rivers of success, and the sandy beaches full of women I&#8217;m too shy to approach.<br />
If anything, Rebecca makes you think, whether you like it or not. Rebecca also strayed into the subject of relationships. We spent a lot of time there. Most of it was Dhar, Stefan, and I arguing the point that women are aloof, and men are stupid.<br />
Allow me to explain: we (the men) have this perception that women send &#8220;signals&#8221; to indicate their intentions. Even I have had this happen to me, and I&#8217;ll tell you something right now: I never saw it. When men are interested in women, we become the most goofy things on the planet &#8230; but we&#8217;re obvious, kind of like tossing a cat into a dog show. But when a woman finds a man attractive, she wants the man to say something first and goes about sending these &#8220;signals&#8221; to him.<br />
Every roommate I have ever had, and most of my male friends (who&#8217;ve had girlfriends and discussed the matter with me) have all confessed to not knowing that his girlfriend liked him until upwards of four months later. Most men would try for about two hours before giving up, then go home and jerk off. Women believe they&#8217;re easy to understand. As a man, I will testify that I will never understand women &#8230; they&#8217;re too confusing. And girls, if you want a blunt piece of advise when trying to hook that illusive man &#8212; beat him over the head with it. Men are dense, we will not notice your advances unless you make us look for them. It&#8217;s like walking into a room blindfolded and being told there&#8217;s a contact lens to be found. You need to show us where you dropped it.<br />
Rebecca disagreed with us. From her point of view, it was women who were easy to understand, and men who were complicated. From her point of view, I could see this happening. But as a man, I can safely say there are only three things that a guy needs to keep him happy: sleep, sustenance, and sex &#8230; the 3 S&#8217;s. (The &#8220;sustenance&#8221; category comprises food, drink (including all alcoholic beverages), violent computer games, a large screen TV, and a sports car that needs constant work.) Believe me, men are not complicated. No assembly required. Batteries not needed.<br />
Next thing I knew, I was floored with the nearly subliminal announcement that Rebecca was bisexual. I&#8217;m not sure what exactly brought that subject around, but I did have to ask a carefully worded question to make sure I heard what I thought I heard. I did.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I have nothing against Rebecca, I have no different a view of her now than I did before she told me of her bisexuality &#8230; although I think I do respect her a little more now. She was very frank about it &#8212; neither positive nor negative, just another aspect of her colourful life.<br />
With that turn of events, I dropped out of the conversation for a while, to ponder on a few things. Bisexuality has always been a topic of interest for me, although I really don&#8217;t know why. Over the years I&#8217;ve developed a few theories about it &#8212; not about blame, or why &#8220;sexually deviant&#8221; practices are &#8220;bad&#8221;, but why they occur. Most of my theories are as of yet incomplete, but I have one that I think about regularly: women are more likely to engage in homosexual situations than men.<br />
This is not an accusation, nor is this truth &#8230; it is a theory. But it&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve based on experience and observation. (No, I have not been renting porno flicks.) Women are more in touch with themselves and their emotions. Women are raised to be caring and tender with themselves, their friends, and their families. Men, on the other hand, have historically been raised in a very aloof manner, where the only accepted form of contact has been the handshake.<br />
It is this very reason that led me to my theory. But over the past couple of years, that theory has become more and more clouded, as new evidence begins to tarnish my well polished idea. If my theory were true, and men were aloof to one another, I wouldn&#8217;t be wondering if I&#8217;m bisexual. This is yet another theory that I have yet to put to the test. (On a similar note, I could also say that I may not be heterosexual, since I haven&#8217;t put that to the test either.)<br />
For nearly the remainder of the distance to Bucksnort, Kentucky, I sat there debating the issues with myself. Was I what I thought I was? Could I do what I thought I might? Could I think tongue twisters and not screw them up? These were the questions that occupied me until we saw the road sign for Bucksnort.<br />
Dhar, who was driving, and I, who was riding shotgun, nearly laughed ourselves to death. For nearly ten miles after seeing the sign we giggled, laughed, snorted, howled, and guffawed. I so desperately wanted to turn around and drive back to take a picture of the sign, just to prove that someone had the guts to name a town &#8220;Bucksnort&#8221;.<br />
Somewhere between 21:00 and 22:00, we arrived in Horse Cave, Kentucky. It was a small, desolate looking place, the only feature that seemed noteworthy was the KOA we were looking for. It was buried about 1,000 feet from I-65 in a grove of tall pine trees. It looked rather picturesque, even though we couldn&#8217;t see the campground for the RVs &#8212; the trees were too dense.<br />
Stefan did his thing and signed us into a spot that was right next to the KOA office, a convenience for using the bathroom. I jumped out and hooked us up, and we proceeded to make our dinner. Digging into the last of the food meant salsa and chips, and the last of the KFC (from which I abstained). The salsa jar fell over while we were eating, staining the carpet in the depressed section of the floor. A quick hosing down prevented a major disaster, but still required a hefty dose of carpet cleaner when we got home.<br />
One of the camper spots across the driving path from us contained a couple whom we though were the campground managers. We assumed this from the woman&#8217;s vigil, staring at us to see what we were up to. After a while we drew the front curtains so we didn&#8217;t have to worry about her any longer. (Though I almost expected that action to prompt the woman to walk over to our van and start asking really stupid questions.)<br />
We almost seemed to know what the next day would bring, and we didn&#8217;t stay up late. It was the first night since Colorado Springs that we turned in early. As we lay there, a slight rumbling of thunder rolled across the sky, quickly followed by a spring rain. I fell asleep listening to the light pattering of falling water.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Aside from a good laugh at Bucksnort (who the hell names a town <em>Bucksnort</em>?), we arrived at Horse Cave without incident. Tomorrow we&#8217;ll probably hit Mammoth Cave and head again towards home.<br />
More and more I believe Dhar leads a very sheltered life. Sex is just a topic he doesn&#8217;t want to talk about &#8230; that and the letter &#8216;Y&#8217; for some strange reason.<br />
Found out Rebecca&#8217;s bisexual. Still wonder if I am &#8211; won&#8217;t know for sure for a while, but either way, [I] really don&#8217;t care. Sex is still one of those annoyingly illusive things.<br />
More and more I think women are like the unasked question: you know there&#8217;s a solution to the question, but you&#8217;re afraid to ask because then you look stupid. Men on the other hand are like an old truth -Why? Because.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite Dhar&#8217;s snoring, I had a fairly decent sleep that night. As was our habit, the first order of business was a shower. Dhar was one step ahead of me, something I gathered by the sound of running water from the bathroom and the empty cot in the middle of the floor.<br />
The couch wasn&#8217;t as comfortable as I thought it would be when I had gone to bed, but I was too lazy at the time to bother setting up my cot. I had escaped the bane of all couch-sleepers &#8212; the kinked neck &#8212; a fluke in retrospect. The seats were springy enough, yet one never knows what a night of tossing a turning will bring. I did have a nasty case of &#8220;fabric face&#8221; though.<br />
When Dhar emerged from the bathroom, I took his place and prepared to wash up for another long day. Or so went the intention &#8230; in practice my goal was a little more difficult. My shower started off okay, but less than 30 seconds into it (fortunately before I put any shampoo in my hair) the water turned ice cold. Then it flipped to scalding hot. Then back to ice cold. This pattern went on for a couple of minutes while I waited at the other end of the bathtub to see if it would stop. But the temperature fluctuations didn&#8217;t stop, and I ended up forgoing on a shower that morning. I made a feeble attempt to at least partially make up for the deficit by meticulously washing my face in the sink.<br />
Dhar had a smile a kilometre wide when I exited the bathroom. He asked me if I liked the shower. The bastard hadn&#8217;t warned me! He&#8217;d let me wander into the shower that morning and burn my skin off while freezing my gonads. So when Stefan and Rebecca emerged from their room a few minutes later, I didn&#8217;t tell them either&#8230;<br />
They found out quickly enough. Rebecca yipped and yelped as the water shifted from flaming to frigid. Expecting a verbal barrage when they emerged, I was rather surprised to hear only: &#8220;That shower sucks,&#8221; as they disappeared into their room. The door closed behind them and silence returned to the room.<br />
Dhar and I set about cleaning up our mess, all the while wondering how a hotel that normally charged $150 a night for our room could have such a shitty plumbing system. I began to question the hotel, thinking that perhaps this was their doing, in revenge for the discount we were getting. Although I put the thought out of my mind (I really couldn&#8217;t see that kind of thing happening), I had nagging doubts all day long. So did we all.<br />
The cameras came out early, I wanted to briefly become a pain-in-the-neck and take a surprise photo. Dhar had been like that for a good portion of the trip, catching us just as we were waking up, while we were driving, anytime that was awkward for the subject of the picture. But Dhar got the essence of what we were, no preparedness for the picture. On other trips I had taken, such a tactic was characteristic of me. I had lost the technique over the years, not having taken many pictures. It was time to start again.<br />
I stood outside the bedroom door and focused my camera on the door. I didn&#8217;t know who was going to come out first so I tried to aim approximately where either Stefan or Rebecca&#8217;s head could be. I held my camera in place and starting talking with Dhar again, not looking in the direction of the closed door. After a few minutes of patient waiting, the door opened and my finger snapped down on the shutter button. It was only after I looked towards the doorway that I realized I had taken a picture of Stefan.<br />
The plan was simple: we were going to see a plantation, specifically Oak Alley. It was just a matter of finding the place. Unfortunately we had misplaced the brochure I had obtained from the KOA office the day before. A complete search of our hotel room and Rebecca&#8217;s purse (where we believed the brochure to be) turned up nothing. Since we had to travel in that general direction anyway (that much I knew), we considered a brief stop at the KOA a good idea.<br />
We packed all our gear together and loaded up to head downstairs and check out. Our semi-dramatic entrance less than 24 hours earlier was being played in reverse, a rag-tag team of four university students exiting from a posh hotel looking almost like we should be living in the streets. I think we all took a little pride in that, our way of telling those who&#8217;d turn their noses at us that we really didn&#8217;t give a damn.<br />
The Behemoth was waiting when we got out to the road, one of the joys of valet service. The bags were stowed, the books stashed, the CD player returned to its place of honour, and the fridge checked to make sure it was still cold. I had made certain the day before that the 12 volt system was switched on and the fridge was set for 12 volt. The battery was nearly dead, but the fridge was cold. This meant our breakfast of donuts, leftovers from the previous day&#8217;s breakfast, weren&#8217;t too runny.<br />
We strapped in and headed our way back to the KOA. By this time we had a pretty good feeling for driving around in New Orleans, and the maps were left on the floor. Rebecca returned to her determination to move to New Orleans. She commented that several of the homes on St. Charles Avenue would suit her nicely. (This from someone who hasn&#8217;t even paid off her school loans yet.)<br />
I had my camera handy as I drove. The sun had finally returned to the New Orleans sky, and I was determined to get some pictures of the tree canopy over St. Charles Avenue. I also took a couple pictures of the trolleys in motion. Soon we were back at Jefferson Highway and heading west. It wasn&#8217;t long before the familiar red and yellow KOA sign appeared around a bend.<br />
I pulled up next to the office while explaining to Rebecca approximately where I had found the Oak Alley brochure in the rack. She dove into the office and returned a heartbeat later, a white piece of glossy paper in hand. I felt a little guilty about taking another copy of the brochure from the KOA when we weren&#8217;t staying there, but we had stayed there one night before, and I somehow doubted that the KOA had to pay someone to stock their printed matter rack.<br />
We drove along until we got to Williams Boulevard, where we turned north towards the I-10. There was a double purpose to the trip along Williams Boulevard, which appeared only a few blocks up from Jefferson Highway &#8212; our long-sought after Starvin&#8217; Marvin. It must have appeared very strange to the staff (not to mention the patrons) to see a large camper-van pull up to the side of the road, a dark-skinned man wearing jeans dive out the side door, take a picture of the store, and dive back in the van, which promptly drives off.<br />
The instructions were reasonably simple: get on the I-10 and travel west to exit 195. We would then travel south on a road that we didn&#8217;t know the name of, which would take us to a bridge that would cross the Mississippi River. On the other side we would find Highway 18. Heading west (or north, depending on what way you think you&#8217;re pointed), you eventually come across Oak Alley.<br />
As I drove, Dhar and I chatted nonchalantly about anything that happened to come to mind. Stefan and Rebecca, however, were unusually quiet that morning. Too quiet. It sounds a little weird, I don&#8217;t deny it, but the lack of conversation from them was disconcerting. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that the escape Dhar and I had pulled had crossed the lines of decency, and they were two harrumphs past annoyed. It seemed reminiscent of the silent treatment kids give to one another in punishment. Whatever the case was, it made me uneasy.<br />
By the time we reached exit 195, Dhar and I were talking about anything just to feel somewhat normal &#8230; at least I was, I don&#8217;t know if Dhar was feeling as paranoid that morning as I. We turned down a nondescript highway towards the Mississippi River. The silence was deafening. There are times that I wish I was psychic, so I could know the thoughts of others. (At the very least, it would help with my social life &#8212; not having to guess whether or not a woman&#8217;s going to deck me simply for talking to her would be a great relief.) That morning I would have loved to know if Dhar and I would live to see the end of the day.<br />
The map on the brochure we had wasn&#8217;t to scale. We didn&#8217;t have a clue where Oak Alley was, only that somewhere along the highway (a small two lane road) we&#8217;d stumble across the old plantation. We rounded a bend in the road, and the space to the south of us opened up. Across a small field, partially obscured by three large trees, was a large red and yellow building. It looked a little out of place, but still seemed to fit in a strange sort of manner.<br />
It was the Laura plantation, recently opened to the public. It had been the only other plantation that the KOA manager had recommended. One of the reasons we didn&#8217;t go was that the manager had pointed out that the plantation had only just opened, and was still working out the bugs &#8230; not necessarily in the literal sense.<br />
Just past Laura was another large bend in the road. Along the southern side was a large line of dense trees, the northern side a steep hill. A small simple sign quickly came into view: &#8220;Oak Alley Parking 500 ft.&#8221; I breathed a silent sigh of relief, I was glad we didn&#8217;t have to backtrack on our route to find the place. In a heartbeat we could look down the feature that gave the plantation its name: an alley of 28 enormous oak trees that led to the plantation house.<br />
We pulled into the gravel driveway at the west end of the plantation lot, and traveled down the slightly winding road to the lot. We deposited the van away from most of the other cars, just so we&#8217;d have some room to maneouver when it was time to leave. The ceiling hatch was opened and the fan turned on to keep the inside cool, we grabbed whatever we thought we might need, and set off to find the main entrance.<br />
The booth was at the north-east end of the lot. Tickets were a little more expensive than most places we had been to at that point, about $8, but the cost included a guided tour of the plantation house. We left the gravel pathways and started eastwards onto an asphalt surface that looked just wide enough to handle the Behemoth and two people on either side. We walked about 100 metres to a junction with another path that ran north-south.<br />
We turned north towards the rear of the plantation manor. Although it wasn&#8217;t what I expected for a residence of the rich and powerful, there was something about it that looked oddly familiar &#8230; I just couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it. We walked along the path under a series of oak trees that looked very similar to those at the front of the house, but smaller in size.<br />
As we approached the rear, we caught sight of a young African-American woman dressed in a period gown, assumedly based on the type of clothes the women house slaves wore when the plantation was in operation. She smiled and bade us a cheerful &#8220;hello&#8221;, which Dhar promptly returned for the rest of us. She was to be our tour guide, and directed us to the front of the house to wait for a bell that would alert us to the next tour of the manor house.<br />
Around the front, the sheer size of the oak trees became very apparent. The constant growth over the years had created branches so heavy that tall metal poles supported the huge boughs, and steel rods were inserted through the trees to keep them from falling apart. The cover over the pathway that ran down the middle of the two rows of 14 trees was so complete, hardly any sunlight reached through. At the other end of the pathway was the wrought iron fence, Highway 18, and the steep hill. It wasn&#8217;t until later that we found out that the hill was one of the levees for the Mississippi River.<br />
I walked halfway up the path and dug out my panoramic camera to catch part of the view of the front of this magnificent building. As I took the picture, that strange feeling of familiarness came over me again. I had seen that shot before somewhere, but I honestly couldn&#8217;t remember where.<br />
Dhar was strolling through the gardens, looking at whatever he happened to come across. Stefan and Rebecca waited with many other people for the bell to ring. The bell was a large rocker bell, mounted on the east side of the house with a rope that ran to the second level. Shortly before the bell finally rung, our tour guide asked for us to sign the guest registry, a formality I hardly saw necessary. I could hardly see the banal quotes and signatures of use unless you happened to be famous.<br />
The bell rung as I was signing, and the tour guide asked us to go to the rear of the house, where the tour would start. The tour guide walked through the middle of the house and opened the door from the inside. Stepping through the door activated a time machine that catapulted us two hundred years into the past &#8212; a past where man enslaving man was normal, electricity was unheard of, chivalry thrived, and the Mississippi River was America&#8217;s Interstate.<br />
The house had three floors, of which we saw two (Louisiana law governing emergency fire exits prevented us from seeing the third floor). The two floors we did see both had high ceilings, anywhere from 15 to 20 feet (I&#8217;m not very good at judging heights). The plan of the floors was simple: a central hallway that ran from the front door (directly in line with the front pathway that ran between the two rows of oak trees) to the back door (directly in line with the rear pathway that ran between the two rows of smaller oak trees). (You could, in effect, see from the rear path all the way to the Mississippi River looking through the house.) At the &#8220;rear&#8221; end of the hallway was the staircase, running from almost halfway up the hall right to the rear wall.<br />
The house was massive, although you really couldn&#8217;t tell unless you looked very hard. And I don&#8217;t mean massive in the sense of &#8220;largeness&#8221;, but in sense of strength. The architects had known that hurricanes were prone to passing through the area, and many homes were regularly destroyed by such storms. The Oak Alley plantation manor was built with five-foot thick brick walls to withstand the storms.<br />
But even a house that massive had the amenity of windows. In fact, all the windows were strategically placed across from each other through doorways. The result was that all the windows could be opened and wind could pass straight through the house to keep it cool during the summers.<br />
Immediately to our left (on the west side of the hallway) was a small drawing room, furnished with a couple chairs, a desk, and a few lamps. The decor looked like Sherlock Holmes&#8217; study. The small room took up roughly a third of the usable space on the west side of the house, yet was barely 20 feet square.<br />
Between the drawing room and the next doorway were a couple linen closets, called &#8220;hidden rooms&#8221;. Behind the shelves were rooms that hadn&#8217;t seen any light in a hundred years. One of the previous owners of Oak Alley used to hold private discussions of politics and life with his friends in the rooms &#8230; and no women were allowed. Naturally the practice led to smoking and over-drinking. Eventually his wife could take no more and had the rooms sealed.<br />
Just to side of one of the closets was a small glass case containing some of the pages from the guest registry, some bearing gold stars indicating the celebrities who had visited the historic home. Some of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest names had walked in the same spots as we were walking, including Brad Pitt. It was when I read his name it dawned upon me where that feeling of familiarity was coming from. By now, you may also know. (For those of you who still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m babbling about, please allow me to enlighten you. In 1993, the Anne Rice novel Interview With The Vampire was filmed on location at Oak Alley. The opening flashbacks of the movie tell the story of Louis&#8217; life in New Orleans, and his mansion is Oak Alley.)<br />
The next room on the west side of the hallway was the sitting room, what we would call a living room. It filled the remaining visible two-thirds of the western side of the first floor (remember there was a hidden room). It contained a few couches, tables, and a fireplace (which to me seemed a little out of place in Louisiana). The guide explained some of the artifacts in the room, including a chaperone&#8217;s mirror and a table with a tilting top.<br />
The chaperone&#8217;s mirror hung on the north wall, and was placed facing south. The mirror itself wasn&#8217;t flat, but curved so that someone standing out in the hallway could still see anyone in the room. It wasn&#8217;t a security device the way we use such mirrors today, but was used to keep an eye on courting couples from afar.<br />
The tilting table was a device used by women to keep the heat of the fire from melting their makeup, which they would wear for weeks at a time. Unlike today&#8217;s synthetic powders and cremes, women of the 1800&#8217;s usually wore beeswax. This was to fill in the pockmarks left by smallpox, through which many people suffered until a cure was found.<br />
Another interesting little detail that the guide pointed out was the abundance of clocks in the house, all which showed exactly the same time, which was wrong. They had all been stopped decades ago when the last owner of the house had died. Following an old southern custom, all the clocks in the house were stopped at the time of death for a period of a year. The plantation was sold before the year was up, and the clocks were never restarted.<br />
Across from the sitting room was the dining room. It had the same layout as the sitting room (not counting the furniture), except for the kitchen door on the south end. In the middle of the room was a long, ornate dining table. Above it hung a large crystal chandelier. Originally the mount from which the chandelier hung was a large fan, which had since been put on display in the south-east corner of the room. The fan looked like a large wooden music stand, without the supporting pole. The fan had once sported a leather cover, and was swung from side to side by a slave child who would stand at the side of the room, pulling on a rope.<br />
We then proceeded up the stairs to view the bedrooms. The second floor rooms followed the pattern of the first floor, two small rooms next to two larger rooms, in the ratio of 1:2 for space. The smaller rooms were for children and visiting young ladies (the young men slept outside of the manor house). Both had large beds, the south-west room was decorated in a style typically used when someone died.<br />
The largest room was the master bedroom, in the north-west corner of the second floor. It had so much furniture and decorations, it looked rather hard to move around in it. Ropes placed across the door frames prevented anyone from entering the room.<br />
We then exited through the north door to walk onto the balcony that ran right around the outside of the second floor of the house. The view of the grounds was much better, none of the hedges and bushes obstructed the view any longer.<br />
After another piece of historical information (which had something to do with where the previous owners were buried, and where the current owner lived), we went back inside through the south door. The guide then ended the tour, upon which we went back down the stairs and out through the front door.<br />
Rebecca promptly announced that she wanted a mint julep. It was Louisiana, it was a plantation, it was getting hot, and the staff were selling them at the rear of the house. I didn&#8217;t know what a mint julep was, other than it was primarily a southern cocktail of some sort, and James Bond drank one in Goldfinger. It&#8217;s mostly straight bourbon with a shot of mint syrup for flavour. It&#8217;s a devilishly simple drink, and damn strong. I had only a sip, but could taste it for hours afterwards.<br />
While Rebecca sipped on her julep, we walked down the rear path under the 150 year-old oak trees (a bit of information we received on the tour &#8212; the trees out front were over 300 years old, and no-one really know who planted them) heading to the southern areas of the plantation. Soon we ended up at the gift shop. Nearby were the bed and breakfast bungalows.<br />
Inside were various pictures, postcards, mugs, hats, t-shirts, cookbooks, spices &#8230; nearly everything you could think of, packed into the neat little shop without it looking cluttered. I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for purchasing anything, so I made use of the toilet instead. Rebecca bought a cookbook.<br />
By that time, the sun was out in full force and the chill had been eradicated. Suddenly the thing to do was to sit in the middle of the vast grass lawns and lay in the warmth. This didn&#8217;t last too long though &#8230; Rebecca sat on a nest of red ants, which promptly bit her in several places on her legs. On the bright side though, the bites would have hurt a lot more if she hadn&#8217;t been drinking mint julep.<br />
We were fairly near to the mysterious graves of the previous owners, so we wandered over a small wooden bridge to a heavily treed area, which surrounded the half dozen graves. I don&#8217;t know if we were expecting anything, because we certainly didn&#8217;t find anything out of the ordinary &#8230; at least for a cemetery. We didn&#8217;t stick around too long, and headed back to the Behemoth.<br />
The next step was to find our way out of Louisiana, and head towards the home of the King of Rock &#8216;n Roll &#8212; Memphis, Tennessee. In our way was Mississippi state, and a long humid drive. The van was cool (the result of the fan), and I assumed the position of navigator while Stefan drove.<br />
We doubled back on the route we had taken, pausing only once to take a picture of the front oak trees one last time before vanishing into the distance. By that time, I was feeling less worried about Stefan and Rebecca. Either they had given up making Dhar and I feel guilty for our actions, or they had just been a little tired and not in a talkative mood. In either case, I was glad we had returned to being yappy.<br />
Returning to the I-10, we proceeded east to I-55, which took us north. We passed by the west end of Lake Pontchartrain, and soon were heading towards home. Although that was a goal a couple days away still.<br />
If I had but one regret about New Orleans, it was not finding any vampires. Not that I really want to be killed by one, or turned into a demon of the night, but it was a view I got from listening to too many stories of New Orleans. Perhaps in the years to come things may change&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960430.15</strong><br />
<em>Day 10</em><br />
Did I step over my bounds, and put Dhar in a bad position? This morning was oddly quiet, almost silent. I&#8217;ve been in situations where friendship is feigned instead of confronting the problem &#8211; I pray that isn&#8217;t the case here.<br />
Dhar and I went out last night for about 2.5 hours, leaving Stef and Rebecca alone in the hotel. Dhar told me that Stef had said Rebecca would be &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; with Dhar and I leaving them alone, yet Rebecca had made allusions to a need for privacy with Stef. This I heard about after deciding that Dhar and I needed to vacate the premises for a while &#8211; both Stef and Rebecca looked like they were about to explode &#8211; they needed some release, and tip-toeing around the issue wasn&#8217;t helping any. Dhar and I may be miserably single, but we aren&#8217;t blind to the needs of couples.<br />
It just dawned on me that I feel fairly relaxed, for the first time in about a year. Even if the vacation were to end now, I would be pleased in the knowledge that I did something.<br />
This morning (after sleeping in and getting scalded by the shower), we went to Oak Alley Plantation. Rebecca got drunk on a mint julep, then bitten by red ants. On to Graceland!
</p></blockquote>
<p>My parents and I have very differing view of what a vacation is. I like to be entertained, kept interested. Plunk me on a beach for a week and I&#8217;ll go insane. Most people would consider the trip we took very stressful, and I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that it wasn&#8217;t totally smooth-flowing (few things are). But we had accomplished so much in just 10 days that I felt a sense of achievement, which gave me my much needed feeling of relaxation. (After five years of university, you start feeling relaxed when you complete big things &#8212; it&#8217;s a learned response developed from doing essays and projects for school. Take an introductory psychology course, and you&#8217;ll understand.)<br />
So as we crossed the state line into Mississippi, I no longer really cared what we did. We had seen almost everything I had wanted to see, and a lot more that I had never really planned on. I had no regrets about what we had done (except maybe the lack of vampires), and no worries about what was yet to come. We were heading for Memphis, and Graceland.<br />
It was past 18:00 when we pulled into a rest stop for a toilet run. The stop was sparsely populated (I guessed not many people travel through Mississippi and stop along the way, either that or they were at some restaurant having a generic pre-fabricated dinner), mostly trucks parked in the front portion of the rest area. Aside from a car and a pick-up that came in and left, we had the rear area to ourselves.<br />
The bathrooms were, shall we say, unique. They were the only ones we used that we would recommend replacing &#8212; there was no possible way to fix that place up enough to make it look good. Most of the inside had been covered in some kind of goop (which I didn&#8217;t want to even go near), the floors hadn&#8217;t been cleaned since the building had been erected, the windows were completely clouded (which might have been intentional, but it was hard to tell), and the only cockroach I saw had died from trying to live in that squalor. The only good point about the washroom was that the echoing made me sound like Darth Vader. Rebecca complained that the place was so bad that it even had the obligatory peephole in the women&#8217;s bathroom. Dhar mentioned that the men&#8217;s room had one too.<br />
Instead of immediately filing back into the Behemoth and hitting the Interstate again, we decided to stay and have dinner. It was an opportunity to eat the potatoes that we had been lugging around for the past 4,000 kilometres. I dug out the barbeque, lit the burner and tossed on eight of the tubers (wrapped in aluminum foil). Stefan complained about the aluminum, claiming it caused Alzheimer&#8217;s disease if it got into your blood stream. I didn&#8217;t know where he got his fact from, but I made a mental note to look into the issue (especially since all anti-perspirants use aluminum hydroxide).<br />
Baking potatoes is one of the most time consuming processes in cooking. (I now know how to cut the cooking time in half, but it didn&#8217;t help that dinner.) So while we waited for the potatoes to cook enough for us to eat them, we laid back and relaxed a little. Dhar broke out the bottle of Budwieser he had bought back in Fort Stockton, Texas. We had to take a picture of him sitting proudly with the over-sized bottle. Rebecca hopped into the picture for show.<br />
Eventually the potatoes had cooked enough so that they weren&#8217;t raw &#8230; they were burned. The barbeque was an good way to cook things, but the heat wasn&#8217;t very well distributed, resulting in over- and under-cooked food at the same time (sometimes in the same piece of whatever it was you were cooking). But I hadn&#8217;t reduced them to charcoal, which made the meal at least slightly edible.<br />
After dinner, we resumed our northerly direction towards Memphis. The trip was a fairly uneventful one &#8230; except for Rebecca&#8217;s continual attempts to strike up strange forms of conversation. (As we had crossed New Mexico, it was going through the alphabet letter-by-letter, listing off every word you could think off, and usually having a long discussion about it. &#8216;Sex&#8217; was a particularly long conversation.) She excelled and coercing people to talk, though after a while Stefan and Dhar would rebel and switch topics to cars or computers. That usually had the effect of either shutting Rebecca up, or making her want to switch the topic again. I sat on the sidelines and watched the fur fly.<br />
Rebecca wasn&#8217;t feeling too well. Our trip had been beautifully planned (though mostly by luck), we had missed nearly every major problem associated with road trips: traffic, bad weather (except in Missouri), and crowds (except in Las Vegas). The only thing we hadn&#8217;t expected was the rise in the price of gas. We also didn&#8217;t anticipate Rebecca falling under the spell of &#8220;The Curse&#8221;.<br />
All women experience PMS in different ways. Some hardly notice it. Some have to get surgery to prevent bleeding to death. Most tend to fall somewhere in the middle. Rebecca was closer the lighter end of the scale (at least from my point of view) &#8212; she could still argue, walk around, and eat. Many of my female friends have very tough periods, with cramps taking them out of service for upwards of an entire day. But cramps are cramps, and as much as men try to think that they understand, none of us have ever had to experience them. Rebecca was visibly uncomfortable. The sooner we stopped for the night, the better.<br />
There were two KOAs in Memphis, one of them was named &#8220;Graceland&#8221;. According to the maps I was looking at, it looked like it was right across the street from Elvis&#8217; Graceland, which to us would be a great advantage. So we opted for the nearer of the two campgrounds.<br />
We arrived in Memphis just after 23:00 that evening. Graceland was located in the south end of the city, so we didn&#8217;t have to spend too much time trying to navigate our way through Memphis. We exited I-55 at exit 5B, turning south onto Highway 51 &#8230; which in Memphis is known as Elvis Presley Boulevard. We drive south for about a mile before finding the KOA sign. Much to our disappointment, Graceland wasn&#8217;t across the street from the KOA, but lay about an eighth of a mile further south.<br />
It was cool in Memphis, the air mass that had cooled off New Orleans the day before had obviously gone through Memphis on its way south. Stefan hopped out of the van and went through the rigmarole of signing all the forms, dotting his &#8216;T&#8217;s and crossing his &#8216;I&#8217;s. Even before that was done, Rebecca and Dhar set out to find the restrooms and see if they were locked. This produced who I assumed to be the KOA manager, who seemed a little peeved about us showing up at 22:15 at night.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca appeared after a few minutes, proudly (but quietly) proclaiming the bathroom doors were unlocked. Stefan finished all the drudgery of the KOA paperwork at the same moment, and we drove the van our to our campsite for the evening. Unlike our previous sites, we had opted for a basic camping site with no hook-ups. They way we saw it, all we were interested in was sleep. No dishes, no electricity, nothing fancy at all. The fridge was nearly empty, hence nothing perishable, and could last the night on the 12 volt system.<br />
After we parked, I made my run to make use of the facilities. I still find it rather surprising just how little we actually stopped for toilet breaks &#8212; maybe a little over a dozen times in the entire trip (not counting stops for meals). We often managed to hold out for long periods of time. Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t so much my surprise at the entire group, but also Rebecca. I know it sounds sexist, but all my experience seems to point to women have small bladders. (And children, but we didn&#8217;t have any with us.) My mother is particularly bad. (My parents have a three month journey planned for the Behemoth starting in mid-September. I can only imagine how often they&#8217;ll be stopping.)</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
It&#8217;s about 23:20, and we&#8217;re settling in for the night. Rebecca&#8217;s got cramps, Dhar seems to be depressed about something, Stef and I don&#8217;t want to go home too early, and our site doesn&#8217;t have any hook-ups. Okay &#8217;nuff complaining.The silence issues may have been from a simple case of exhaustion &#8211; and I seemed to the only one completely awake. I can only hope Dhar got enough sleep [last night], or I&#8217;m going to tape his mouth shut and make breathe through his nose!

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The morning was sunny and humid, much like the day before. We awoke between 08:00 and 08:30 following a long and comfortable night&#8217;s sleep. Showers were the order of the morning, to prepare oneself for the long day ahead. We had planned to execute the steps of Rebecca&#8217;s master plan to conquer the world &#8230; starting with New Orleans. A plantation tour and a visit to the swamps were main directives.<br />
Several RVs and campers were packing up, preparing to travel to their homes in some distant state or country. Dhar hadn&#8217;t yet returned from his venture of the night, but we knew he soon would. Vampire or not, we had all his clothes.<br />
The shower was inviting, I felt rather invigorated. Not a particularly active morning person, I&#8217;ve found a good morning shower as effective for me as coffee is for others. However, my morning was to take a minor plunge when I returned to the van. I found, much to my horror, I was out of underwear. I had managed to stretch my week&#8217;s worth of clothing to almost nine days (remember that I two of those nine days were virtually extensions of two others, effectively making seven days), but I had finally reached the end of the line.<br />
Dhar entered the van a moment later, carrying a small box of laundry detergent. (I hadn&#8217;t noticed the return of the Neon on my way back to the van.) The verdict seemed to be unanimous. It was laundry day. Dhar had purchased the small box of soap for everyone, which really made a lot of sense. There was no way we were going to be washing again before the trip was over, so might as well use all that we could. Dhar had already started his wash.<br />
I gathered all my spent clothes together (already contained in plastic grocery bags) along with my towel and bathing suit. I intended to wash all the clothes I could, so for a couple of hours that morning, I wore only a t-shirt and my fleece shorts &#8212; all my underwear went in the wash. It was a bit drafty without a layer underneath, but in the warmth of south Louisiana, you really don&#8217;t notice it much.<br />
The laundry house was about 15 metres away from the van, a short walk around a couple of nearby RVs. Entering through the east end, the room contained washing machines to the left and right of the doors, and a double bank of dryers at the opposite end. A short line of chairs rested on the right side of the room where there were less washing machines. The solitary occupant was an elderly man, undoubtedly washing his clothes.<br />
I dumped the entire contents of the bags into a single washing machine, not bothering to separate colours. I hadn&#8217;t brought anything that hadn&#8217;t already been washed a million times &#8212; bleeding colours wasn&#8217;t really much of a concern for me. I sprinkled in a few mounds of soap, shook it into the gaps between the shirts and shorts, then throwing in a last handful for good measure. I clapped in the $1.00 washing fee (all quarters) into the pull slot and sent the industrial washer into high gear.<br />
Figuring on about 40 minutes to wash my clothes, I took the opportunity to get a few chores done. First on my list was to call home. I had told my mother I would call when I got to Texas. Unfortunately, we had passed rather quickly through that state, and I missed my chance to report home. A phone nearby the laundry house fit the bill.<br />
Mother still hadn&#8217;t found my health insurance, but I wasn&#8217;t too concerned by that point. She asked how the trip was going and how well we were holding out. I kept the call fairly short for two reasons: 1) I didn&#8217;t want to talk too long during the day, and 2) I didn&#8217;t want to have to answer a lot of questions I&#8217;d have to answer again when I got home. (This is another reason why I write this. If you asked me how the trip was, you undoubtedly got directed here.)<br />
As I hung up, I felt a few drops of rain fall on me. I looked up into the sky, noticing that a few clouds were beginning to fill the sky. I headed back to the van to make sure that nothing got wet. Dhar was sitting at the picnic table next to the van, writing postcards to his family. I asked him how his night had been. Trouble found Dhar yet again.<br />
Having dropped us off, he had driven back downtown again to see what else he could do. He went into a bar (assumedly to have a drink or two) and was promptly discovered by a group of our fellow countrymen, in various states of intoxication. This wasn&#8217;t the bad part. That came about when one of the group announced, rather loudly, that Americans don&#8217;t know how to party. Dhar wanted to crawl under a rock. I would too in that situation.<br />
I take objection to putting down the residents of any one country without good reason. Given, Americans tend to be looked down on by many Canadians for various reasons (some are rather insipid or meaningless), but that didn&#8217;t give those fools any reason to spout their mouths off like that. They, like us, were guests of our gracious hosts, and one does not want to offend one&#8217;s host. Especially if there are more of them.<br />
Following his tangle in the bars of Bourbon Street, Dhar drove around for quite some time to use up as much gasoline as he could. In doing so he drove three-quarters of the way to Baton Rouge and back (a trip of about 120 miles). Still having well over a quarter of a tank of gas remaining, he toured New Orleans until returning to the campground.<br />
I decided to take after Dhar and write some more postcards home. I wandered across the campground lawn, crossed the road and entered the KOA office just as Rebecca was leaving, acknowledging each other in passing. One of the male KOA staff, whom I assumed to be the manager, was looking at Rebecca as she left the building, shaking his head. He asked of me:<br />
&#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s a natural thing, or do they do that on purpose?&#8221;<br />
(He was referring to way women&#8217;s hips tend to swing as they walk.) I promptly answered: &#8220;With her, it&#8217;s sometimes hard to tell.&#8221; (There are many long stories that go into that statement, and none of them are going to be repeated here. Suffice to say, this was neither an insult or a &#8220;factual statement&#8221;. It was a ribbing if anything. Had Rebecca heard me, she would&#8217;ve returned the favour.) The two of us laughed a little, then I got down to business. I grabbed four postcards, trying not to spend too much time in selecting them, and bought four 40 cent stamps to get my messages home.<br />
As I finished paying for my message medium, I started probing the man for information. We had plans to do some visiting that day, and I figured enough tourists came through the KOA in a year to make the staff reasonably knowledgeable in the right places to see. I asked the man what was the best plantation to see, and which swamp tour came most recommended.<br />
Barely skipping a breath: &#8220;If you go to a plantation, everyone&#8217;ll ask ya which one ya went to, and everyone&#8217;ll ask if it was that one,&#8221; he said, pointing his finger to a rack of pamphlets next to the door. I had to ask for clarification as to which one he was referring to. &#8220;Oak Alley. Most famous one of all.&#8221; Following his pointing and reading the titles carefully, I found the illusive white booklet near the top. The picture on the front looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out why.<br />
As far as swamp tours were concerned, we just had to keep in mind how much we wanted to pay, how far into the swamps we were willing to go, and so on and so on. I was appraised of one particular tour guide who only did the tours at night, looking like someone who had decayed in the swamp for several years. He picked up his passengers in a hearse and took them deep into the swamp where he would scare the hell out of them. Goes to show you, people are stupid.<br />
Taking the advise and thanking the manager for his time, I returned to the van to get ready to finish off my laundry. I figured that enough time had passed that the wash would be ready to dry. The old man was still sitting in his chair when I entered the laundry room. My machine, closest to the dryers on the right side of the room, was still going. With no visible timer built into the machine, there was no way to tell how long until it was all dry.<br />
I left and returned a few minutes later, this time with more success. I opened the clear plastic door of one of the upper dryers (they were stacked in twos) and plopped in the 50 cent drying fee. I was about to close the door when I realized I had no fabric softener sheets. Knowing I&#8217;d end up buying more than I needed, I shut the door and dealt with slightly rough clothes for the rest of the trip.<br />
About 40 minutes later my mostly dry clothes emerged. Like many laundromat dryers that I&#8217;d used over the years, these didn&#8217;t do a perfect job, coming just shy of where they needed to be. But dry enough for me. I packed the lot into the two grocery bags that I&#8217;d brought them out in and returned to the van to sort the lot out. The first order of business was underwear, the constant draft was becoming disconcerting. I packed the dry clothes in my backpack, and laid the slightly less dry clothes out in the diminishing sun to finish drying.<br />
I had thought earlier the clouds were going away. But more and more poured in from the north. It looked like rain. Dhar thought so too. As if on cue, the manager appeared at our side door and pronounced exactly what we were thinking. He then suggested that we skip the swamp tours. Apparently when it rained, everything one wants to see in a swamp disappears until the sun comes back out and dries everything off.<br />
But like Cliff Clavin, he just couldn&#8217;t stop with that one fact. He immediately jumped into how much rainfall New Orleans received in an average storm. I&#8217;d heard about the rain briefly from my friend Chris, who had visited New Orleans a few years earlier on a music trip (not unlike the one featured in [[Music Trip to Orlando, Introduction|Music Trip to Orlando]]). But we had yet to experience it&#8230;<br />
The rain, so the man was telling us, comes like an orgasm: quick, short, hot, and wet. In fact, so much rain falls in an average rain storm that New Orleans installed a series of pumps to get the roads dried out as quickly as possible. Each of these pumps empties the equivalent of a swimming pool of water every second. (That&#8217;s about 35,000 gallons, or 133,000 litres.) There are 38 of these pumps, each generating a spout of water over 10 feet across. Needless to say, Dhar and I were duly impressed.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca returned from the office, and everyone agreed we needed food. Normally, we would be out touring or on the road to our next destination, having eaten breakfast. But we had tapped the last of our breakfast food the day before. Stefan and Dhar volunteered to find some donuts for us to eat, and promptly drove off in the Neon.<br />
Not long afterwards, the clouds began to start shedding some of their moisture. Not a lot of it, most just a few sprinklings, but enough to cause me to starting bringing in the towels and clothes that had been sitting in the sun. The clouds kept getting denser and denser, blocking out more and more of the sun with each passing minute. We were going to experience a New Orleans downpour, but we didn&#8217;t know when.<br />
I informed Rebecca about the problems with seeing the swamp in the rain. She looked a little dejected, but agreed that we would be better off in sunnier conditions. This left the door open for more touring of the city. (Visiting a plantation in the rain would be just as bad as the swamp &#8212; but it would be us wanting to disappear into shelter.)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960429.1125</strong><br />
<em>Day 9</em><br />
Today we&#8217;re heading for a hotel, then downtown for some fun. Did my laundry this morning, which is good &#8216;cuz I ran out of underwear last night. Expecting a torrential downpour today.<br />
Dhar and Stef are off getting donuts for breakfast / lunch &#8230; brunch?<br />
Had an interesting conversation with the manager &#8211; regarding the swinging hips of the fairer sex, he making a specific reference to Rebecca &#8211; I think only because he realized we know each other. It&#8217;s hot, it&#8217;s humid and I&#8217;ve got an acne breakout.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Checkout for us was at noon. Stefan and Dhar took a significant amount of time in returning to us with our breakfast (rapidly becoming lunch), arriving at 11:45. They claimed a great deal of trouble in finding a donut shop, eventually finding one not too far from the KOA.<br />
On a whole, American donuts don&#8217;t quite match up to Tim Horton&#8217;s, a cornerstone of Canadian cuisine. Most tend to be rather dense, crumbly, dry, and bland. But the donuts that Dhar and Stefan found (for a surprisingly low price, only about $2) were a taste of home &#8230; with about four times the amount of sugar. Never before had I eaten a donut that made my heart palpitate from the level of sucrose. Not that I was complaining, they were damn good.<br />
We ate hastily, not wanting to overstay our welcome at the campground. The uneaten donuts were crammed into the fridge, and we set about unhooking the Behemoth from the city utilities and preparing to hit the road. When we were ready to leave, Dhar jumped in the Neon while Stefan, Rebecca, and I drove the van.<br />
We had decided on a hotel on the north side of the Garden District, about two miles from the French Quarter. In a map that Rebecca had taken from the KOA office the day before (the maps were free), we found a coupon for a one-night stay at the Avenue Plaza Suite Hotel and Eurovita Spa. (Long name, eh?) The usual price for the room was well over $100, but the coupon knocked the price to $50.<br />
We pulled out onto Jefferson Highway and started heading east. Almost immediately we lost Dhar in the traffic, but in a matter of seconds he appeared just inches off our rear bumper. Actually, he appeared then disappeared as he approached our rear bumper &#8212; the Neon was so short that I couldn&#8217;t see him through the rear window.<br />
Our view along Jefferson Highway was unimpeded by night, the &#8220;urbanness&#8221; of the area was rather plain given the city&#8217;s downtown decor. We listened to a local radio station as we drove, it was only the second time we listened to the radio since leaving home. The music was &#8220;new rock&#8221;, which is essentially a blend of rock &#8216;n roll and alternative styles. The radio station seemed to be populated by some rather interesting people, as was indicated by their self-promotion:<br />
<q>&#8220;Broadcasting live from a concrete warehouse somewhere between two cow pastures!&#8221;</q>We drove along Jefferson Highway until we reached Carrollton Avenue. Here we turned right to head south towards the Mississippi River. Down the centre of Carrollton Avenue runs one of the lines of the famous New Orleans trolley cars. Extending over Carrollton Avenue was a spectacular canopy of trees, forming a flora tunnel. Both the trolleys and the trees ran along most of the length of Carrollton Avenue, and continued along St. Charles Avenue.<br />
The sky above us had by now completely obscured the sun. The wind had picked up a little, and the temperature dropped. As we reached the elbow of Carrollton Avenue (where it turns into St. Charles Avenue), we saw a wall of wind come over a small hill next to the river. The wind carried leaves, small twigs, large drops of water, and the odd small animal. The Behemoth rocked slightly to the left as we turned the corner.<br />
A moment later, the rain started. Under the continuing canopy of trees the rain wasn&#8217;t as pronounced, but when we entered one of the gaps the full force of the rain could be seen and felt. The storm we had experienced driving through Missouri was the only thing I could think of that even remotely came close to that kind of deluge.<br />
We had a distance of about three and a half miles to cover before we arrived at the hotel. During that time we passed by some of the most awesome architecture in houses that I&#8217;d ever seen. Rebecca and Stefan came to the conclusion that they were going to move to New Orleans and live in the area. I stifled a laugh. We passed by Tulane University and Loyola University about a third of the way along St. Charles Avenue, which only strengthened Rebecca&#8217;s desire to move. She started wondering what graduate programs they had.<br />
As we passed Jackson Avenue, our hotel appeared on the north side of the road. Parking was at a premium in the area, so we pulled into the first available side street so Rebecca and Stefan could get us checked in. I had to park in a no parking zone (next to a fire hydrant), and Dhar pulled in on the opposite side of the street.<br />
The rain seemed to fall in millions of continuous streams, causing the streets to look like shallow rivers. I switched off the windshield wipers but kept the engine running in case I had to make a hasty exit. I stared at the flowing water, listening to the radio while waiting for the verdict to come from inside. And I waited. And waited. And waited. It took less time for me to sign into Treasure Island and have the four of us move into room.<br />
After over 15 minutes, Stefan sprinted from around the corner of the hotel and entered the side door of the van. The hotel management hadn&#8217;t believed the coupon at first, and only after a lot of wrangling with Rebecca did they give in. I was to drive around front so we could bring all our stuff inside. Stefan then ran over to Dhar to tell him the same.<br />
Having parked on a one-way road, I had to drive around the block until I was driving west on St. Charles Avenue, allowing me to easily pull into the front of the hotel. We made quick work of pulling all our necessary stuff out, trying to stay as dry as possible. When I went around to the rear door (where my backpack was stored), I found that the edge of the road had four inches of water coursing towards the street grating.<br />
If we had looked a little odd walking into Treasure Island, we put a sore thumb to shame walking into the Avenue Plaza Suite Hotel. The decor was white marble, gold trim, with mahogany desks and paneling. The upper class guests frowned upon our sandals, cheap clothing, baseball caps, and backpacks as they walked outside. I felt very strange about leaving a set of keys with a valet. It wasn&#8217;t that I was afraid he&#8217;d steal anything, but it was the fact that there was no other choice than to use a valet.<br />
The Jazz Festival over until the following weekend, the hotel was mostly deserted. Our room was on the sixth floor, St. Charles Avenue west wing, north side. The room wasn&#8217;t immense, but had two beds, a table, bathroom, kitchenette, and a TV. We unceremoniously dumped our belongings about the room, made quick use of the facilities, and prepared to return outside to start making use of our afternoon.<br />
Stefan protested at first, not wanting to go out (he was a little damp from running around in the rain), but his better half told him to get his ass in gear before she threw something at him. The rain had brought a change in our plans, and we reverted to visiting the Aquarium of the Americas. It wasn&#8217;t the aquarium per se that we wanted to see, it was mostly the IMAX 3D movie that played there.<br />
The Aquarium of the Americas is at the foot of Canal Street, on the river front. We found a public parking lot nearby and deposited the Neon. By this point the rain had mostly fizzled out, leaving just a few falling drops. I was now waiting for the onslaught of the sun, which from what I had heard always came out after such a storm and dried everything out.<br />
The Aquarium building was huge. At least two American football fields in length (but probably closer to two Canadian football fields), the massive building contained both the Aquarium of the Americas and the IMAX theatre. The front of the building faced the Mississippi River, the rear faced the parking lot where we left the Neon. A long wall separated us from the Aquarium, but it ended parallel to the edge of the building anyway and wasn&#8217;t too much of a blockade.<br />
As we rounded the wall we found more trolley tracks. I hadn&#8217;t realized that New Orleans had more than one line of trolleys. Just off to the right, flush against the wall, was an enormous steel gate about three feet thick. The gate was solid (we don&#8217;t know if it was filled with anything, but I assume it was), running the height of the wall, about 10 feet. A steel track laid into the pathway running between two sections of the wall suggested that it was closed once in a while.<br />
At first I thought it was a security door, closed at night to prevent someone from stealing the fishes. A moment later, its real purpose dawned on me. I had forgotten we were next to the Mississippi River, the most notorious for flooding in North America. The thick walls and the gates were flood prevention devices. There were no visible signs (i.e. high water marks) that showed whether or not it had been put into use, but if history was any indication of the future, the water would soon rise.<br />
Just past the trolley tracks we crossed a brick courtyard. Most of the brownish-red bricks had names carved into them, undoubtedly the names of the people who had donated money to fund the Aquarium&#8217;s construction and operation. We stopped briefly at a bank machine so Dhar could try and get some money (his attempts were rather unsuccessful).<br />
As we rounded the next corner of the pseudo-rectangular building, our hopes of a peaceful visit through the complex were dashed when we found a small ocean of ankle-biters, rug rats, brats &#8230; in other words, children on field trips. Dhar slowed briefly as we walked forward. I could hear his heart beating harder as his hatred for crowds took over.<br />
The Aquarium entrance had about ten thousand people milling around in front of it, mostly the students and teachers getting their tickets to enter. We stood patiently in line, wondering when we&#8217;d get in. Then one of the Aquarium employees yelled out that we (that being anyone waiting in line) could get tickets for both the Aquarium and the IMAX movie at the theatre box office. Even before the employee finished yelling we were half-way to the other end of the complex.<br />
The lineup there was almost non-existant. In less than two minutes, we had our $15 tickets for the Aquarium and the IMAX movie. Our primary goal was the movie, but we had 45 minutes until that goal could be fulfilled. To fill the time in between, we opted to visit the Aquarium first. This meant we had only 40 minutes or so to see the entire attraction (our ticket didn&#8217;t allow reentry), and paying another $7 wasn&#8217;t part of our plan.<br />
More schools had arrived while we were buying our tickets. More kids. More screaming, hyper, insolent, brutish kids. Dhar and I were beginning to feel a little claustrophobic &#8230; and we weren&#8217;t even through the doors yet.<br />
The atrium didn&#8217;t have much to offer. A new exhibit on squids was under construction, but aside from a concrete wall, there was nothing to see. As we rounded the wall however, everything came into view &#8230; literally. The dark grey concrete wall was part of an immense tank in which several species of fish lived. Along the bottom of the tank ran a 10 foot wide transparent tube through which visitors could walk through the bottom of the tank, seeing the fish in as natural a habitat as was possible in an artificial system.<br />
The walls must have been about a foot thick to withstand the pressure of the water and the pounding of all the kids. If some madman ever wanted to kill off all the children on the planet, all he&#8217;d have to do is create an underwater dome made of crystal, and put all the kids in the dome. They&#8217;d break it apart long before their air ran out.<br />
I snapped a couple fuzzy pictures of rays (or skates &#8230; can&#8217;t quite tell them apart) as they floated just above the clear tube. On the other side of the 40 foot long tube was a large window, allowing a view of the tube itself.<br />
Varieties of tropical fish, plants, eels, and what-have-you were contained in small displays around a nearly semi-circular wall on the other side. The number of kids in the immediate vicinity was enough to drive you nuts. Stefan and Rebecca were completely unfazed by all the screaming, yelling, and crying; they didn&#8217;t notice the trillions of legs and arms, moving faster than Captain Kirk on an alien sex-kitten. I guess when you deal with Eric for 18 hours a day, everything else seems calm.<br />
Therein lay a problem: Dhar and I were ready to quickly work our way ahead of the Munchkin Convention and tour the rest of the Aquarium in relative peace. Being immune to the effects of children however, Stefan and Rebecca were keen on seeing all the exhibits. But being rational adults (you know you&#8217;re getting old when you can write &#8220;adult&#8221; about yourself and not cringe), we came to a compromise: Dhar and I would warp through the Aquarium and meet them at the IMAX theatre 15 minutes before the movie started.<br />
In a flash, Dhar and I entered the tropics (the next area of the complex). Spiders, strange looking fish, rays (that killed more people in the Amazon than piranhas), and a few things that I didn&#8217;t recognize were scattered about. (Not literally.) But there were kids. Where the pathway curved and narrowed, they blocked the path. Dhar was about to have a heart attack &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t handle it anymore. I suggested chucking a few ankle-biters into one of tanks to give us some more room, not to mention a wee bit of enjoyment.<br />
I suddenly stopped, coming to the realization that we were in the Amazon. Every exhibit featuring the Amazon had to have at least one tank of my favourite little fish. I started looking from side to side, briefly appearing as a much larger and hairier version of the kids we were trying to avoid. Then I saw them, tucked next to a set of stairs that ran up to a wooden catwalk. The next thing anyone near me heard was:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s swimming in the deep blue sea!<br />
He&#8217;s after you, he&#8217;s after me!<br />
He&#8217;ll eat you up, oh yes he will!<br />
&#8216;Cuz he&#8217;s a baaaaaad fish!<br />
PIRAHNA! PIRAHNA! PIRAHNA! PIRAHNA!</p></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly, you must be as puzzled as Dhar was. It&#8217;s completely understandable. In fact I&#8217;d be rather surprised if you did recognize this. It&#8217;s a song you&#8217;ve never heard before and probably will never hear again (unless this story somehow becomes a movie, in which case this will be a featured song in the soundtrack). It&#8217;s called &#8220;Piranha&#8221; (gee, no kidding?), and was performed by Lord Tracy, from my friend Chris&#8217; &#8220;Albums by Bands You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of&#8221; collection. It&#8217;s a very fast paced song, sounding almost punkish in its style. And it&#8217;s hilarious.<br />
Having explained that to Dhar, he came to the realization that I was a freak of nature. I was surprised that Stefan and Rebecca hadn&#8217;t warned Dhar ahead of time, or that he hadn&#8217;t figured that out for himself before that point of the trip.<br />
Following my little explanation, Dhar and I promptly ran up the stairs to avoid the flood of children. There were a few running around the catwalk, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as stuffy up there. It was also a lot more boring &#8212; there was nothing to see &#8230; except a couple of macaws hanging from a branch below us, defecating on anyone dumb enough to stand under them (such as ankle-biters). We didn&#8217;t spend long up there, winding our way over to a set of stairs and running right into Stefan and Rebecca. Our plan to get away from the crowds wasn&#8217;t working very well.<br />
The next room had the exhibits most kids (okay, most boys) wanted to see: predatory animals. Electric fishes and eels, angler fish, and the most predatory of them all, sharks. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by sharks, even though I&#8217;ve never been able to watch all of Jaws &#8212; scares the hell out of me. We wandered about the exhibit, seeing some of the neat things the staff had built to entertain the kids.<br />
Aside from the obvious &#8220;petting pond&#8221; (which we avoided, mostly because the low walls couldn&#8217;t be seen through the million or so children surrounding it exclaiming their disgust at all the sliminess before thrusting their hands back in the water), the exhibit that intrigued Dhar the most was a demonstration of an electric eel&#8217;s shock. It was a simple static electricity device, generating a charge by rubbing plastic plates with a wire brush and spinning a glass bowl (I know, it sounds weird &#8230; but it works).<br />
Kids were running over to this thing, whirling it around, burning the ends of their fingers, and then daring their friends to do the same. Dhar watched in delight as all these kids were whipping their hands around in pain. One girl came up to Dhar and asked him what the device did, and Dhar explained what it was for. Then the girl suggested that Dhar try it first, but he said that he already tried it, and that she could go ahead. The look of apprehension on the girl&#8217;s face was priceless &#8212; she didn&#8217;t seem to realize that she didn&#8217;t have to use it!<br />
Into another short hallway we walked (now beginning to lose the sea of kids) and found a small gift shop featuring entirely shark-related merchandise. It was essentially three 10 foot tall dividers that connected to one of the permanent walls to form a booth. The Aquarium ceiling was at least another ten 10 feet above the wall, and there was no roof on the booth. There wasn&#8217;t much there of interest, save a shark-shaped oven mitt.<br />
As we left the little stand, we swore we heard a crow. Stopping dead in our tracks, we checked to make sure we heard what we thought we heard. We heard it all right. A large raven (though not nearly as large as the ones at the Grand Canyon) was perched on the top of one of the gift shop walls, cawing away happily. Dhar and I only had a moment to wonder what the raven was doing in there when I heard a guard explain the story to a woman who had asked the same question.<br />
When the Aquarium was being built, the raven had flown into the structure. Eventually it had become a mainstay, always in the area. When the walls and windows had finally been installed, they tried to flush the raven out, but with no luck. After a while, they just accepted the bird as a permanent resident.<br />
The next section of the Aquarium was devoted to aquatic reproduction. Emphasis came on the rituals of the reproductive cycles, shying away from the more &#8220;dirty&#8221; aspects. Dhar and I found the quickest way through the section, claiming it was too depressing to remain in for very long. As far as we were concerned, the fish were getting it more often than we were, which put us below fish in the hierarchy of getting lucky.<br />
We soon found ourselves above the entrance to the IMAX theatre, overlooking about a trillion kids standing in line to see the film. Dhar and I suddenly felt very compelled to find Stefan and Rebecca, or end up at the sides of the theatre (not a very nice place to be).<br />
While Dhar backtracked to see if he could find them, I went a bit further ahead to see if somehow Rebecca and Stefan had passed us. The room I entered to contained the local biology: sturgeon, catfish, paddlefish, sawfish, gars, just about anything you&#8217;d expect to find in the New Orleans area swamps and salt-water marshes &#8230; even alligators. Well kept behind a thick panel of Plexiglas (most likely Lexan), the last remnants of dinosaurs just lay on rocks, their eyes twitching slightly.<br />
But a good Aquarium knows how to sell itself and its attractions. Aquarium of the Americas was no exception to this rule. One of their claims to fame is a rare albino alligator. I&#8217;d never seen one before, and the tank it lay in (as nonchalantly as its brethren) allowed me to get close to the great white gator. My pictures weren&#8217;t the greatest, due in part to the tank walls and the refractive properties of the water. But I got my proof for those nay-sayers.<br />
Next to the alligator tank I found a small sign which told the tale of a rather confused shark. Apparently a lonely male bull shark managed to get lost while swimming in the Gulf of Mexico. Not a terribly hard thing to do &#8212; it is a large body of water, after all. But this guy swam up the Mississippi River &#8230; to St. Louis, over 600 miles upstream in fresh water. Okay, some bull sharks live in fresh water, but the story seemed to indicate that it was a salt water shark.<br />
Dhar reappeared, not having been able to find either Rebecca or Stefan. We thought that maybe the crowds had gotten to them after all, and had gone ahead to the theatre to meet us there. We jogged our way out of the Aquarium and down the outside of the complex to the theatre entrance. The trillion or so children were gone, undoubtedly waiting in line for seats. To make things worse, neither Stefan or Rebecca could be found. It was not looking very promising&#8230;<br />
Dhar suggested that I wait in line while he waited for Rebecca and Stefan to appear. He couldn&#8217;t go back into the Aquarium (due to the &#8216;no reentry&#8217; policy) and waited in the upper lobby. I ran down the stairs to the lower level to wait in the line.<br />
Sure enough, the trillion or so school children were already there. If we were lucky, we would get seats in Tuktoyaktuk. About five minutes after I got in line, one of the yellow-shirted teachers (I assume it was a teacher, all the visitors from the local schools were wearing yellow shirts) called for all the students to group on the other side of the foyer. In less than a minute, there were only thirty people in our lineup. No sooner had the line decreased in size than Dhar reappeared with Stefan and Rebecca in tow.<br />
Our apparent good luck started to sour only seconds later, when the yellow-shirted kids were let in through the doors on the opposite side of the lobby. We hoped that we would be let in first, or at least at the same time. It was a good five minutes before the doors opened and we walked into a short hallway, picked up our polarized lenses and took seats towards the back of the theatre.<br />
What&#8217;s with the polarized lenses? Geez, I forgot to mention this was an IMAX 3D theatre, didn&#8217;t I? (How did that slip my mind?) Yes, IMAX 3D. If you&#8217;ve ever seen an IMAX movie, you know what the image quality is like, and that the sheer size of the movie makes all the world of difference when watching something you&#8217;ve never seen before. So it was fairly safe to say that when we (all of whom had seen an ordinary IMAX movie &#8230; assuming you can call an IMAX movie &#8216;ordinary&#8217;) heard about the 3D movie, we had to see it. (Truthfully, I can&#8217;t speak for Rebecca. But Dhar, Stefan, and myself were gung-ho enough for about 20 people.)<br />
The process was fairly simple: the movie was filmed with a special camera that mimics the human bi-optical perspective (i.e. it has two lenses spaced about an inch and a half apart); the film is then run through a special camera that projects both images through polarized filters, which polarize one side vertically and other horizontally; the glasses block out one side of the image, allowing your brain to see two distinct images (a normal happenstance), which are pieced together in the occipital lobe of your brain, creating a three dimensional image.<br />
Having said that, the movie was amazing. The introduction was in standard 2D, during which time the glasses were useless. But when the 3D portion started, all the hoopla (and the price of the tickets) became justified. Aquatic life was the subject of the movie, and the 3D portion started in the sea &#8230; rather, right at the surface of the sea. The water seemed to literally come right out of the screen, your eyes right at the border of air and water. It was a surreal feeling to know that you should be wet, but weren&#8217;t.<br />
The movie made good use of perspective, having fish or other aquatic animals swim up to the camera and then swim away. A pass through a kelp forest was equally as intense. The quality of the IMAX film process led to another little feature &#8212; small particles of matter could be seen float all around you for most of the 20 &#8211; 30 minute movie. Of course nothing was so disturbing as a disgusting little sea creature that terrorized all the kids in the front rows.<br />
Stefan, Dhar, and I spent a good deal of time looking at the technical aspects of the movie. This involved wearing the glasses upside-down, wearing the glasses backwards, not wearing the glasses, or wearing two pairs at once. Except when not wearing only one set of the lenses, you could see the 3D effect normally. Even when the lenses were backwards or upside-down, the brain could still create the proper image.<br />
One problem we noticed with the movie was focusing. Humanity has existed in a true three dimensional environment since the day eyes were created. Focusing on a nearby item or on a mountain hundreds of kilometres away became taken for granted, we had control over the focus. But not in the movie. The focusing was done by the filming camera, so only those details that the cameraman filmed in focus remained in focus. If you tried to look deeper into the 3D image to see something else that was a bit fuzzy, it remained fuzzy. This tended to cause a lot of eye strain after a while, and both Stefan and I took our glasses off more than once during the movie to rest our eyes and avoid a brain hemorrhage.<br />
Everyone applauded loudly when the movie ended, with good reason. It&#8217;s quite the achievement. Too bad most of them don&#8217;t know IMAX is a Canadian invention. (The company used to be based in my hometown until they moved to Toronto.)<br />
As we left the theatre we handed in our polarized glasses, assumedly for recycling or reuse at the theatre. When we arrived back at the main floor, Rebecca ducked into the nearby gift shop to buy something for the kids. I could imagine Eric and Thea&#8217;s excitement when Rebecca and Stefan returned home &#8212; gifts from faraway lands. My sister and I were always like that when my parents returned from some corner of the Earth I haven&#8217;t yet seen. It was usually a t-shirt, but at least it was an interesting shirt.<br />
Outside was surprisingly cool considering the rain had stopped some time earlier. According to all that I had heard of New Orleans, it should&#8217;ve been sweltering and sunny by that time. But the clouds still cast the grey gloom about the city. At least the air wasn&#8217;t dripping with humidity. It was strange weather, at least from what we had been used to since we left the Rocky Mountains, and different than we had expected in Southern Louisiana.<br />
We returned to the Neon to drive back to the hotel. We obtained a much better view of the downtown core of New Orleans, the filtered sunshine provided much better light than the streetlamps at night. It didn&#8217;t change the fact that we still had to deal with far too many one-way roads though. But Dhar had quickly grown familiar with New Orleans, and had us back at the hotel before we could say &#8220;jambalaya&#8221;.<br />
Upon returning however, Dhar suddenly became rather aloof again. He discussed taking the car back (we felt we didn&#8217;t need it anymore), but had some other things in mind, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda. I figure that by now you&#8217;ve probably realized that this wasn&#8217;t an abnormal thing for Dhar. It was still a little disturbing though.<br />
As Dhar sped off down a side road, we remaining three reentered the hotel. But instead of going immediately to our room, Rebecca wandered over to the front desk and asked if it was possible to change rooms. Somewhere along the line we had found out that the hotel was nearly deserted (no events were ongoing at the time to warrant a full house), and this gave Rebecca the idea that more room would be a good idea for the four of us.<br />
Stefan wasn&#8217;t really in the arguing mode, so he boarded the elevator (partly thinking that we would quickly be following) and went up without us. The hotel manager finally gave into Rebecca&#8217;s request after a few minutes of haggling and provided her with a key to a room two doors down from ours. He said that we could have it for an extra $10.<br />
Stefan was waiting for us when we got off on the 6th floor (he didn&#8217;t have a key), and was looking a little peeved. The new room was on the same side of the hall as our current one, but was in the corner of the building. This was one of the &#8220;suites&#8221;, having a separate bedroom with king-sized bed (and a TV), large bathroom, couch, table, full kitchenette (with a dishwasher), and a large TV in the living room. It took us only moment to decide to keep the room, which led us to transfer all our stuff from the first room to the new one.<br />
It was now time to relax slightly. We hadn&#8217;t really had a break since the early afternoon in Las Vegas, and even that was short-lived. We turned on the TV and channel-surfed for a while. We even had both TVs going so we could watch different channels. I wisely separated myself from Stefan and Rebecca, who laid down on the bed in the separate room. Before long, the door had closed behind them.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate Supplementary</strong><br />
I feel lonely. I should have gone off with Dhar and get into trouble. It&#8217;s not that being alone with Stef &amp; Rebecca is bad &#8211; don&#8217;t get me wrong, they&#8217;re good friends &#8211; but if you put [a couple] in a place where they can&#8217;t be alone, they start getting annoyingly, rather, sickeningly emotional towards each other.<br />
I&#8217;m not uncomfortable about sex &#8211; many of my friends are very knowledgeable (and experienced) about sex. My problem stems from my current solitary status &#8211; and whenever I am reminded of this, I get depressed, irritable and downright awful. I&#8217;ll have to make sure that they get some time along tonight.<br />
I have to envy both of them &#8211; devoted to each other, defined goals, children &#8230; and Rebecca is a sex expert! I will grant them one thing over most other couples I&#8217;ve met &#8211; they&#8217;re quiet. Don&#8217;t make me any more comfortable though.
</p></blockquote>
<p>About an hour or so later, the door opened and Rebecca emerged. Stefan had apparently gone to sleep and she didn&#8217;t want to disturb him. It was time to start thinking about our next meal. Rebecca desperately wanted to eat at one of the balconied restaurants in the French Quarter. The idea was very appealing &#8230; if only the weather would cooperate.<br />
We started calling some of the restaurants that came recommended. All had a maximum of three people at a table (due to the width of the terraces), and all were open only if the weather permitted it. Rain had started to fall again, but only lightly. This gave us some hope of obtaining a table. But what if Dhar returned before we left? The problem was Dhar never said when he was returning (if at all), so we couldn&#8217;t plan anything to include him.<br />
The rain increased to a steady heavy rainfall as we discussed the matter. The balconies seemed out of the picture. So we started digging through more of the restaurants to find alternatives. After a little debate over what kind of food we wanted, we decided upon the CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon. Rebecca called and made reservations at 18:30 for four, just in case Dhar reappeared. .<br />
Stefan stumbled out of the bedroom, looking a little disheveled, but otherwise awake. He was a little surprised to find that dinner had been planned without his knowledge (or consent) &#8230; we suggested that he be awake the next time.<br />
The next order of business was transportation. We didn&#8217;t know for certain whether or not Dhar was taking the car back (although we assumed he was). Mind you, we were also unsure of his time of return. Excluding Dhar from the grand scheme, we narrowed the choices to the trolleys or a taxi. I held out for the trolley. I&#8217;d wanted to ride one ever since I saw one on Carrollton Avenue earlier in the day.<br />
Thus began the tidying up. Not of the room, but of ourselves. This required me to take a trip down to the hotel lobby and coerce one of the valets to let me into the van to retrieve my toiletries bag, which I had accidentally left behind. The hair was combed, the teeth brushed, and the beard shaved. A shower wasn&#8217;t terribly necessary (we hadn&#8217;t exerted ourselves enough to warrant one), so was ignored.<br />
As we approached our moment of departure, we knew we would have to leave a note for Dhar to tell him where we were. I opted to write the note in advance, but spent most of the note telling him where I would be after sending Rebecca and Stefan home to spend some time alone. I had decided that I would get some relief by allowing them relief from us. I already knew Dhar would be in agreement (we had discussed the issue a few times before, usually when Stefan and Rebecca were sound asleep in the rear bunk). The trick was to leave it for Dhar but make sure that neither Stefan or Rebecca saw the contents.<br />
As we entered the lobby, we went to the front desk to leave the message. I was handed an envelope, upon which we wrote Dhar&#8217;s name. I then inserted the note (despite Rebecca&#8217;s repeated requests to read it first) and sealed it. We continued to the front door and out into the early evening to catch a trolley to downtown.<br />
We didn&#8217;t know how long we would have to wait, there was no posted schedule. According to those we had asked, the trolleys ran about every 15 minutes. That was assuming no delays anywhere along the lines. The longer we stood waiting, the more we wished we had brought along an umbrella. The rain had never completely stopped, coming and going in spurts, and the odd few drops seemed to indicate another downpour. And we had no shelter.<br />
A vacationing couple arrived, and a short conversation ensued. Two trolley cars passed in the opposite direction, we continued to absorb more rain, and our time kept running out. The Rebecca, Stefan and I soon starting considering taking a taxi if we were to make our dinner reservation downtown. Almost as soon as that thought had come out into the open, Dhar emerged from a taxi in front of our hotel. Immediately I yelled for him not to let the cab get away, and the three of us sped across the St. Charles westbound lanes.<br />
Having nothing else to do, Dhar decided to tag along even though he had already eaten. Our taxi driver was a local man, possessing a very Cajun accent. He was about 25 years old, and had lived in the area all his life. As he drove us along (giving us some interesting information about the city &#8230; which I&#8217;ve since forgotten), he told us of his dream: to buy a house in or near the French Quarter and rent it out during Mardi Gras for $2,000 a week.<br />
Sounds steep? When you consider that hotel rooms are at least $100 a night (and higher in the French Quarter), and houses can sleep as many people as you can cram into them, $2,000 isn&#8217;t such a major cost. The man added he would gladly stock the fridge and supply the beer and liquor. I figured he&#8217;d still make a ton of money during that week.<br />
When we arrived at Bourbon Street, Dhar paid the fare and we hopped out. The rains had washed the roads, much of the smell from the night before was gone (but still noticeable). All the drunks were gone too, the lack of a festival seemed to drive them off. Bourbon Street was now the domain of the tourist, soon to give way to the drunken tourist as night fell.<br />
As we neared the CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon, we saw the Maitre D&#8217; out front, trying to draw in early eaters. It seemed that most people tended to eat a little later in New Orleans, typically having dinner after 19:00. Ironically enough, that was when I typically had my dinner when I lived at home. But tonight we were the &#8220;early birds&#8221;, about to catch a very large worm.<br />
The Maitre D&#8217; spotted us as we neared, and his tirade began again. The chef was doing something special for those keen on coming out early, prepared to withstand the culinary onslaught that was about to be inflicted upon them. For nearly five minutes, with hardly a chance to catch his breath, the Maitre D&#8217; extolled the virtues of the menu, the succulence of the food, the charm that exuded from the building itself. Then, as if on cue, we all nodded in agreement and walked in as if we had been hooked by the Maitre D&#8217;s divine skills. We promptly announced we had reservations.<br />
The only thing that stopped the Maitre D&#8217;s chin from falling too far was the floor. For nearly a half second (which was the longest silence we heard from him) he stared at us in disbelief. To be somewhat supportive to the distraught man, I tried to cheer him up, complimenting him on his wonderful speech. He walked outside in disbelief, poking fun at the way we&#8217;d led him on when he was trying to do the same to us.<br />
CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon was a small restaurant, having only 20 tables or so. Upscale restaurants tend not to have too large a space, and usually have a large staff. Such was the case with CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon. We had four or five people waiting on us in various roles: the Maitre D&#8217;, a wine steward, hostess, server, and probably someone else that I&#8217;ve since forgotten.<br />
The wine was one of the first orders of the night, and that became a in-depth debate between the four of us and the wine steward. Rebecca was keen on a 1993 wine, but none was to be found. (From what I understand, 1993 was a good year &#8212; so good there&#8217;s no wine left.) To ensure we had an excellent wine as we could afford, I offered to pay for it (my logic following along similar lines that brought me to pay for the hotel room in Las Vegas).<br />
I can&#8217;t remember the name of the wine, but it was a dry (a one or a zero) red. Not a terribly large wine drinker, I&#8217;m by no means experienced in what is good and what isn&#8217;t. But I know what I like, and I didn&#8217;t hate it.<br />
When it came time to order, Rebecca and I opted for one of the Chef&#8217;s specials &#8212; blackened red fish. I didn&#8217;t know exactly what it was, but all I remember is asking for it nice and hot. I figured that sooner or later I&#8217;d have to eat something that was hot, if only to get the experience. Rebecca had done the same, but only after consulting with the hostess to make sure it wasn&#8217;t too hot. We weren&#8217;t the typical tourists that wandered through New Orleans, thinking hot for them was hot for a resident of the Mississippi delta. No, my friend, what&#8217;s hot for them would kill most people. Except Dhar. What Dhar considers hot could be used to generate steam in a nuclear power plant.<br />
Stefan ordered some local specialty, but I can&#8217;t remember if it was seafood-based or chicken. Either way it was a lot tamer than the jambalaya he had the night before. Dhar, who had already eaten prior to coming out to dinner, ate precious little and only ordered an appetizer as his meal.<br />
Despite my request for hot food, my fish wouldn&#8217;t have made Frosty the Snowman break a sweat. It was good fish, but it was lacking the spicy flavour I had been hoping for. I was tempted to return it and get something spicier, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling like an asshole that night, and quietly ate my fish.<br />
Stefan picked up the tab for dinner (later to be recorded in the log for prosperity &#8230; and so Stefan would get some of his money back), and we returned to Bourbon Street. In the hour and a half that we had dined leisurely, what was left of the tourist population of New Orleans had descended on the French Quarter. Not all of them in the streets &#8212; many were eating, or in the various shops. But it didn&#8217;t look dead any longer.<br />
We sauntered down the street, looking for something that would interest us. Dhar and I were hatching plans to ditch Stefan and Rebecca, in hopes the two of them would go back to the hotel early. Unfortunately, no matter what stores and whatnot we entered, the group stayed tight. We must have entered half a dozen sex shops, three or four voodoo stores, about a half-million t-shirt vendors, and a couple of artwork boutiques. But no such luck, we were still together.<br />
After a while, one of us came to the conclusion that we needed to listen to some music. We passed by one particular club that was blaring some of the funkiest R&amp;B that I&#8217;d heard in years &#8230; and it was live! Dhar was the first to duck in the door, the rest following on his heels. We could hardly hear ourselves, but we didn&#8217;t much care. At least until we realized that the one drink minimum cost $8.50 apiece. That, unfortunately, was after we&#8217;d already bought the damn things. I happened to notice the prices on the back wall, hidden from view.<br />
We quickly agreed that one drink was all that place was going to get out of us, and as soon as we were done, we were gone. But we didn&#8217;t escape that establishment any further unscathed. To add injury to insult, one of the band members started making rounds of the club with half a water cooler bottle collecting tips from the audience. It wasn&#8217;t mentioned anywhere, nor was it said by anyone, but the tips were mandatory. I found the smallest bill I had and tossed it in. I was very reluctant to pay $8.50 for a drink then have to pay another dollar to leave. I only wish I could remember the name of the place so I could warn people not to go there.<br />
We hastily left and resumed our wanderings. Down side streets and along a few alleys, all the while Rebecca was complaining about how cold it was. That much I could agree with. All I had every heard of New Orleans was how hot and humid it was there. The day before, New Orleans lived up to that reputation with every second. But as we tried our best to get lost, we shivered in temperatures that were in the low teens (Celsius) and possibly even as low as single digits.<br />
We visited several stores, shops and boutiques before Dhar remembered that he wanted to buy a radar detector. That led us back out to Canal Street at the western edge of the French Quarter. All along the east side of Canal Street are a half dozen large electronics stores which cater to tourists of all countries. Huge camera lenses, multi-lingual radar detectors, more audio products than you could listen to in a life time &#8230; and all over-priced. Must be because of the tourists. Rather, the gullibility of the tourists and the greed of the owners.<br />
Rebecca and I did window shopping while Dhar and Stefan haggled with the twits behind the desk at one of these shops. While they argued for a better price, I hinted to Rebecca that Dhar and I were staying out late that night, to give her and Stefan some time alone. She took a little offense to it, but I added (as humourously as possible) that the two of them were driving Dhar and I crazy.<br />
Dhar left the place empty-handed. The prices that the stores wanted (they all seemed to have the same &#8220;high-priced&#8221; supplier) were more expensive than ones Dhar could get back home &#8230; even if the exchange rate was 1:1. Dejected and forlorn, we continued to wander our way around the city.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take long for our topics of conversation to start swaying towards being drunk. I suppose it was in part to our earlier attempt that evening at the R&amp;B club (thwarted due to the exorbitant price of a $0.50 drink) and constantly being passed by overly inebriated tourists. The conversation continued until we walked into a store just inside the French Quarter to purchase something highly intoxicating.<br />
The store was like a small Wal-mart: everything you could possibly never need all under one roof. Including the illusive Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, which was what the goal of the night quickly became. In addition to the rum, we also purchased a large bottle of cranberry juice for mixing. I chose to look for something more along my lines, but struck up empty. In our following continued wanderings along Canal Street I looked in several of the smaller corner stores with about as much success.<br />
Finally the lure of the liquor got us directed towards our awaiting hotel room. We weren&#8217;t up for the walk however, and jumped into the first taxi we came across. The driver was an older man (compared to our previous driver), in his 40&#8217;s, and a member of one of the Louisiana cultural groups: Creole, Acadian, or Cajun &#8230; I don&#8217;t know which. He hardly acknowledged our entrance into his cab, barely indicated that he understood our request, and continued his unintelligible conversation with someone over taxi&#8217;s radio.<br />
Arriving back at the hotel, I paid the cab fare and we proceeded to our hotel room. The TV shone to life as Stefan poured out three drinks, myself abstaining. And there we sat and talked and watched TV for a couple of hours. One of our topics was the plan for the following day. Not knowing exactly how long a drive we had until we reached home, we didn&#8217;t want to stay too long in New Orleans. Stefan and Dhar both wanted to return by Saturday so they could do some work (a taboo subject to be discussing on a vacation).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplementary</strong><br />
New Orleans is cold. Why, I dunno. Our hotel is nice, but having Stef &amp; Rebecca in the next [private] room is going to be interesting. I still want to go out and leave Rebecca and Stef alone for a while.<br />
Went to the Café Rue Bourbon. Good food, but was hoping for something a tad spicier.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At a quarter after midnight, one of Stefan or Rebecca promptly announced that it was time for bed. Dhar and I took the cue to announce that we were still hungry and were going to get something eat. At first our action might have appeared rather innocent in its nature, but I quickly emphasized that we would not be back until 02:00 at the earliest. I figured that an hour and three-quarters would be sufficient enough time for whatever was needed. (For Dhar and I, it was simply to escape for a short time.)<br />
After changing into some slightly warmer clothes, Dhar and I took the only room key and ventured out into the cool night air. Our first order of business was finding a place to eat. I vaguely remembered seeing a restaurant that featured a garlic-based menu not far from the hotel, so we decided to check it out. Alas, we were too late, it had closed almost an hour earlier.<br />
Still hungry, but not discouraged, we turned in the direction of the French Quarter and started walking. I learned a great deal about Dhar that evening, it was kind of a &#8220;male-bonding&#8221; thing, I guess. I don&#8217;t particularly believe in &#8220;male-bonding&#8221;, I think it&#8217;s some term a female psychiatrist came up with to make men feel better about &#8220;talking&#8221;, which many don&#8217;t appear to do. My friends at home and I talk a lot, so this wasn&#8217;t something foreign to myself. It didn&#8217;t seem to be foreign to Dhar either.<br />
One of the things I learned that night was one of the probable reasons why Dhar went off on his own so much. Unlike Stefan, Rebecca, and myself, Dhar had never had a vacation before. He had lived the first 26 years of his life in eastern Ontario, with only the odd excursion outside of his realm. With the advent of this trip, he had been exposed to the wonder of travel, the excitement of discovery, and the feeling of freedom that comes from a true road-trip. At once I understood why Dhar had gone off on his own, why he had chosen to see all that he could see &#8212; he might never see it again.<br />
About two or three blocks from our hotel we stumbled across a little diner called The Trolley Stop, assumedly because it was next to a trolley stop. Not the fanciest looking place we&#8217;d seen, but the &#8220;Open 24 Hours&#8221; sign in the window was enough to convince us to drop in and see what we could order up.<br />
It was almost like stepping into an episode of Cheers &#8212; there were patrons who immediately looked like regulars, and I felt like I was trying to break into a tightly knit group of friends. But the feeling didn&#8217;t last long. A few moments after stepping into the diner, a smiling waitress swooped down upon Dhar and I, and led us to a corner table. The African-American woman looked in her early 30&#8217;s, and was a classic example of a &#8220;people-person&#8221;.<br />
Most restaurant employees are &#8220;professional&#8221;, in that they stand next to the table, intently listening to the orders, speak &#8220;properly&#8221;, and do not engage in idle conversation. This woman swung a chair around so it was backwards to the table, plopped down on the seat leaning her large arms over the back, clutching a pad and pen in one hand. She then struck up a brief conversation about what was on the menu, and asked if we liked what we&#8217;d seen of New Orleans. I guess to the well-trained eye, you can&#8217;t escape looking like a tourist.<br />
When the topic of food rolled around, we began to ask for suggestions. We concentrated on the things we had never eaten before, and gumbo rose to the top of the list. Dhar ordered a seafood gumbo, and I ordered the chicken variety. Dhar then engaged in a debate about hot food with the waitress, denying the cook could make it hot enough for him. Lo and behold, the cook came out to support the diner&#8217;s end of the conversation. After a few minutes, the waitress winked at him and said: &#8220;We&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; ya honey!&#8221; and laughed as they went off to concoct a gumbo that the army could use as a chemical weapon. I made sure that they understood I was keen on living that night.<br />
To drink I ordered another Abita Turbodog, purposely asking for the bottle so I&#8217;d bring it back with me. I had every intention of showing my friends back home the label of my new favourite beer. It was just as I sort of remembered it from the night before (one Turbodog and lime daiquiri do strange things to you &#8212; I suppose I should be glad I didn&#8217;t have a margarita): cold, dark, and tasty.<br />
Gumbo is a rather interesting dish. It&#8217;s a soup poured over a little bit of rice. It&#8217;s thick, made with vegetables, meats &#8230; just about anything you can think of &#8230; and a lot of spice. Dhar immediately took a spoonful of his bowl, swirled it around in his mouth like an experienced wine taster, the swallowed. The waitress and the cook both stared at him waiting for a verdict on the gumbo. Without a crack in his voice, he pronounced it: &#8220;good&#8221;.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t good enough. Dhar was looking for something that would at least make him break a sweat. Although spicy enough to burn out the sinuses of most normal people (I tasted a drop from my little finger and found it more than enough to make me choke), Dhar slurped it down like a glass of ice water. He was quick to point out that it was a very tasty dish &#8212; the flavours were intense and countered the lack of spiciness. Although not deathly hot, I had to agree that gumbo is a meal that I would eat again.<br />
Paying our bill and leaving a nice tip for the wonderful service we received, Dhar and I resumed our trip towards the French Quarter. We still had over an hour to kill before we could go back, so we decided to see what trouble we could get into. I felt a little apprehensive about following Dhar after midnight, wondering if we&#8217;d get shot at or attacked by some freak in the shadows. Trouble seemed to follow Dhar. I just hoped trouble didn&#8217;t like me.<br />
Along the way we passed two women and drunk man arguing with one another; a different drunk man urinating in the middle of the sidewalk, oblivious to our existence; a few vagrants trying to find a place to bunk down for the night; and a couple bank machines, both of which Dhar tried to use. It was at the first bank machine that I came to the realization that I had forgotten the Turbodog bottle, despite my asking Dhar to remind me.<br />
Dhar&#8217;s luck with bank machines south of the border was dismal. Every time he tried to withdraw $100, the transaction was refused. I wondered why he was having so much difficulty, especially when my bank card neatly deposited nearly any amount I needed with only a slight wait for the CIBC&#8217;s computers to figure out where my bank account was. Then I found out that Dhar was using his Mastercard to withdraw money. I don&#8217;t like using credit cards to do that &#8212; too much of a hassle. Eventually Dhar had to settle for $20 at a time, which cost him over $4 in transaction fees each time he tried.<br />
The business district was devoid of activity, save for the biting wind that blew through the canyons created by the skyscrapers. Dhar and I blasted through the area with the determination of the most dedicated speed-walkers. In only a few minutes we were standing on the edge of Canal Street, looking into the French Quarter.<br />
Some had left, but the heart of the city continued to pump with life. The strip bars were still open, the bars still poured drinks, and a few restaurants still served food. On this occasion, only Dhar entered any of the establishments, which was to obtain a drink.<br />
Having no plan other than to stay out until at least 02:00, we wasted time by walking wherever it seemed like a good idea. That brought us to the Aquarium of the Americas. But we approached it from the eastern side, from where the French Quarter met the Mississippi River. A pathway ran alongside the river, parking lots on the one side, bushes and the river on the other.<br />
All the drinking finally got to Dhar, and he needed use of the facilities. Specifically a toilet &#8230; any toilet. Unfortunately there wasn&#8217;t any in the area, at least none that were open for use. Dhar couldn&#8217;t just whip it out and let loose on the path either &#8212; there were undercover cops around. (You can tell because they&#8217;re the ones sitting in large cars in parking lots at 01:45 in the morning.) So we kept walking until we were partially out of sight, at which time Dhar dove behind one of the bushes before he wet his pants. I kept watch for the aforementioned authorities.<br />
Feeling a little lighter and a lot more relieved, Dhar returned to the path and we walked towards the Aquarium. It looked very different at night, all the lights were off except for a few neon signs. I wondered what the crow was doing then, and if anyone had fed it that night.<br />
We rounded the western corner of the building and passed through the flood-wall gate, debating for a brief moment to follow the trolley tracks to see where they went. Soon we found ourselves back in the business district again, and with nothing else to do. Trouble had seemed to elude us.<br />
All the souls of the evening realm of New Orleans that we had met on our way to the French Quarter were gone. A trolley clunked by on what I assumed to be the last run of the night (even though everything we had read indicated a much earlier stop time), heading towards our hotel. For a brief moment we contemplated taking a ride, but the extra time it would take to walk the distance we considered time well spent. The last thing you want to do is walk in on your roommates when they&#8217;re occupied.<br />
It was after 02:30 when we arrived back at the hotel. For a fleeting moment I had this awful thought that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to get in, that the hotel locked its doors after a particular time. That was a short fear that disappeared when we saw the beaming face of the night clerk, watching the door for any activity. We smiled and said &#8216;hello&#8217; as we boarded the elevator.<br />
The lights were all off, and the room was quiet. We entered as silently as we possibly could, not a particularly easy task when the door has squeaky hinges and the toilet flushes loudly. I brushed my teeth, relieved my bladder pressure, and removed the sheets from my cot. I didn&#8217;t feel like sleeping on the cot that night, and flopped on the couch for my rest. Dhar opted for his cot.<br />
Dhar fell asleep almost instantly, not having slept for nearly 30 hours. Unfortunately it also meant he started snoring earlier than usual. But soon I too was sleeping soundly. That is, until Dhar woke me up some two or so hours later. That I considered quite the feat &#8212; once I fall asleep, I sleep hard. The only think I know that gets me up in the middle of the night is a fire alarm. But Dhar&#8217;s snoring was so loud I woke up. I lay in amazement for a few moments before I got up and nudged Dhar awake to get him to stop.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a kid, I could never sleep in a moving car. I could never understand why, but the motion made me feel uneasy and I would sit there until we stopped (usually at home) before passing out. This inability to sleep in cars stayed true until I went on our tour of America. I quickly learned to shrug off that apprehension, falling asleep at a moment&#8217;s notice.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly when I succumbed to the ravaging of Mr. Sandman, but I do know that I did get a little sleep that night. The night was hot and muggy so I slept in my clothes. In a rare event, I managed to sleep in the rear bunk, since Stefan was driving and Rebecca was (also in a rare event) awake. As with school-buses that pass over bumps in the road, the rear end of the Behemoth tended to fling anyone in the rear in a slightly vertical motion. I was bounced around once in a while, but after a while I didn&#8217;t seem to notice or care.<br />
When I awoke, Rebecca was sleeping in the depression in the floor, her head resting on the extra seat cushion from the rear bench. It was still very dark out, but I could tell that the desert had been replaced with trees which now lined the sides of the Interstate. Carefully stepping my way over Rebecca, I made my way to one of the forward seats. It turned out I had awaken at a very appropriate time, about 20 miles outside of San Antonio. It was nearly 05:00, and the early morning traffic was nonexistent.<br />
The City of San Antonio seemed to come from a transformation of the forest, from trees to steel, glass, and concrete. Street lights appeared and soon we found ourselves in a bustling, albeit sleeping, city. Our primary goal was to find The Alamo. It was marked on our maps, providing an approximate location. Having no maps of San Antonio, we would have to guess our way in finding its exact location.<br />
The I-10 came in from a roughly north direction. From there, we turned briefly onto I-35 heading west until we got to I-37, and resumed a southerly direction. After only about a mile into I-37, we got off at the Houston Street off-ramp listing The Alamo. Unfortunately the markings disappeared once we arrived at street level.<br />
Everyone ended up navigating, trying to find some indication that would show us The Alamo. We went up and down nearly every street, road, avenue, and boulevard in the general vicinity of The Alamo before someone got the idea of following a large wall around to see what it was. To our luck, the wall that we had seen a half dozen times in our search happened to be the outer wall of The Alamo.<br />
All the pictures and movie scenes that I had seen in my years never gave an impression of The Alamo sitting in the heart of San Antonio. From the surrounding streets you couldn&#8217;t see the mission building, the main building of The Alamo, and the part everyone recognizes. We pulled up at the main entrance of the complex while Dhar ran out and took a picture. As it turns out, all he got was a doorway through The Alamo&#8217;s walls, it was impossible to see anything past the hall.<br />
Dhar returned to the van, and we drove off. Disrespectful as it was, I couldn&#8217;t help but find everything that The Alamo stood for (in a metaphorical sense) rather laughable. The American view that defeat is not an option is something I simply cannot fathom. 187 people were massacred when Santa Ana&#8217;s forces laid siege to the mission fortress, and Americans now view the defenders as heroes. I seem to have this rather odd view that they were too damn stubborn to realize they were hopelessly outnumbered, and would be better off retreating to return with more soldiers.<br />
But the defeat at The Alamo wouldn&#8217;t be the last for America, though they would seldom admit to it. Take Vietnam for example: for more years than was necessary, the United States led the &#8220;fight for democracy&#8221; in Vietnam, afraid that the incursion of Red Chinese might somehow affect American freedom on the other side of the Pacific. After hundreds of thousands of American causalities (a.k.a. deaths), someone finally realized the situation was hopeless. (You&#8217;ll note that the stubbornness hadn&#8217;t gone away in the 160 some-odd years since The Alamo.) When American troops finally pulled out, the action was labeled as a &#8220;strategic withdrawal&#8221;. Sometimes they just don&#8217;t know when to quit.<br />
Stefan pulled back onto Houston Street and headed back to the I-37. A few traffic lights and a couple side streets, and we were heading north back to the I-35 and then to the I-10, which would take us to Houston. Our navigation there was the worst we had to that point (but wouldn&#8217;t be the worst overall), we even managed to take the long route out of San Antonio &#8212; we should have taken the I-37 south to the I-10 where it swung from north-south to east-west, saving about 10 miles.<br />
Not far out of San Antonio, Stefan called it quits for driving and abdicated the throne to Dhar. I in turn took over as navigator as Stefan hopped in bed with Rebecca for some sleep. Dhar and I chatted a while as we drove, I found out that Stefan had managed to run into as many deer in Texas as we had found rabbits in New Mexico. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh, but it explained why Stefan seemed a little strung out while we were trying to find The Alamo.<br />
But I quickly realized that I hadn&#8217;t received as much sleep as I thought I had. All that driving I had done the day before (or earlier that evening, depending on your point of view) had hit me harder than previously acknowledged. My eyes started sagging, my thoughts clouded over, my muscles gave out, and before I knew it, I was waking up with a stiff neck. When I awoke, Dhar started laughing at me, apparently my bobbing head had become a source of entertainment for him as he drove.<br />
We drove until Dhar got tired, which seemed unusual for our resident vampire. So I took over driving again, just as dawn was beginning to crack. I figured I had enough sleep during our initial stint on the I-10 to make it through the day. I was wrong. Dhar passed out after only 15 minutes or so, and it wasn&#8217;t long before I felt my judgment clouding and my eyelids became very heavy. I wasn&#8217;t very far off from falling asleep. As Dhar put it, I needed to have my clock reset with the rising sun.<br />
But the rising sun was hidden behind a thick haze, and my eyes never set upon the restorative powers of the sun&#8217;s rays &#8212; I was getting more sleepy by the second. With what few mental faculties I had left, I managed to convince myself to pull over at the next rest stop and transfer the power to someone else before I lost control and killed the lot of us in a fiery blaze of glory. Luckily, a rest stop appeared before I dozed off behind the wheel.<br />
I pulled up to the side, behind several semi-trailers (whose drivers were undoubtedly doing the same thing I was about to do) and came to the gentlest stop the van had yet performed. No-one woke up. Not in the mood to waken anyone, I put the gear in park, turned off the engine, tilted my chair back, and went one-to-one with the sleep fairy and lost in a first-round knockout.<br />
I have no idea how long I slept, but it couldn&#8217;t have been more than an hour. I didn&#8217;t seem to sleep too deeply either, for when Stefan woke up and promptly asked where we were, I immediately replied that I didn&#8217;t have a clue and only stopped to prevent us from dying in a head-on collision when I fell asleep while driving. Stefan accepted the logic without question.<br />
Having only marginally more sleep than I, Stefan took over driving for the next little while. (Remember that Stefan slept through the Roswell to Fort Stockton stretch.) By that time, I was more or less awake, and sat behind Stefan while we continued our easterly direction. We drove until around 10:00, when Stefan and I could no longer withstand our stomachs&#8217; calls to breakfast. Luckily, just east of Houston we came across our favourite eating place, the International House Of Pancakes.<br />
We barely beat the bible-thumper crowd, arriving only about 10 to 20 minutes before an onslaught of well-dressed Texans appeared for post-worship brunch. When we entered, we must have looked quite the sight &#8212; disheveled, tired, hungry, and not smelling at all like roses. We were seated all the same (right under an air conditioning vent) and serviced no different than anyone else. Ya gotta love them Texans!<br />
Texans are a nice bunch, but not as personable as those in Las Vegas. The service wasn&#8217;t poor, but it was like comparing a $150,000 Mercedes-Benz to a $15,000 Chrysler. Both may be good cars, but the Chrysler comes off a lot worse if you drove the Mercedes first.<br />
We gorged ourselves on sustenance, much to the chagrin of the Texans. Every so often I managed to catch a glimpse of someone staring at all the plates, glasses, bowls and pots scattered about our small table. Large families didn&#8217;t have as much food as the four of us did, and it was Stefan and I who seemed to eat the most (though Stefan could out-eat me any day of the week).<br />
When we exited the restaurant, we realized just how much humidity there was. The Gulf of Mexico was now less than 100 miles from us, and its effects could be easily felt. I knew that as we got nearer to Louisiana, and closer to the gulf, the more uncomfortable it would get. The van&#8217;s air conditioner was beginning to look like a good idea, even though we had ruled its use out much earlier because it sucked up a lot of gasoline.<br />
Louisiana would become Rebecca&#8217;s domain during our trip. Here she seemed to gain total control over the rest of us, we didn&#8217;t really argue with her declarations. Her first declaration was that we were visiting a plantation and going on a swamp tour. I hadn&#8217;t really planned on that (I hadn&#8217;t planned on anything), but as far as I was concerned, it was something to do.<br />
Her next declaration was that we weren&#8217;t going to be taking the Interstate all the way to New Orleans, our Louisiana destination. Instead we would follow the coastal highways, overlooking the swamps, bayous, marshes, and the Gulf of Mexico. My efficiency instinct kicked in again, and I tried to persuade the group that the Interstate would be a much better route. After some discussion, we compromised and agreed to take the Interstate half of the way, and the more major highways the rest of the distance. This compromise came to being mostly after I pointed out that some of the highways Rebecca wanted to travel didn&#8217;t exist any more (courtesy of past hurricanes).<br />
Shortly before noon, we crossed from Texas into Louisiana. Seemingly almost immediately, the humidity rose. No longer was it the sticky mass of air we had been traveling through, it was virtually like swimming. If it were any higher, we could have drowned not having come close to the sea. Perspiration couldn&#8217;t evaporate &#8212; it actually attracted more moisture out of the air. It was hideous.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960428.12</strong><br />
<em>Day 8</em><br />
Nevada was hot. Louisiana is humid. We&#8217;re sweating to death here. We&#8217;ve pretty much shot through Texas, although that took about 12 hours to do. We stopped once to see the Alamo, at about 5 in the morning.And so we head for New Orleans, where we intend to relax for a while.<br />
It&#8217;s interesting to note that despite the fact that we all love control, we all get along really well.
</p></blockquote>
<p>After two hours of humid torture, we reached Lafayette. We left the relative comfort of the Interstate and entered onto Highway 90. If you want to see things off-the-beaten-track, you need to take roads that make no sense. Highway 90 is just such a road. According to the map, it wiggles all over hell and half of creation before worming its way to New Orleans. The route easily adds on an extra hour or more to the trip, but the sights are something to behold (though not nearly to the degree of going through Colorado).<br />
There&#8217;s nothing particular special about the route, you travel through a lot of towns (both small and large), through several bayous and swamps, over canals, passing by centuries-old plantations. But any typical tourist route never uncovers these things. Louisiana is a country unto itself, containing a history and culture that can&#8217;t be found anywhere else in the world. You can&#8217;t understand it unless you&#8217;ve seen how the people live and work. New Orleans is a melange of that culture, but the individual flavours are something to experience.<br />
But too much of a good thing soon becomes rather dull, and by the time we reached Houma, about 35 miles from New Orleans, we were all beginning to think the Interstate wasn&#8217;t such a bad idea. I resumed by post behind the wheel, and allowed myself to concentrate on the driving rather than super-saturate myself on the landscape. About 25 miles later, we finally found the I-310.<br />
The I-310 was part of the I-10. American Interstates are brilliant examples of traffic control &#8212; they take an Interstate (say, the I-10) and when it hits a city, they divide it in several places and tack on a third number to indicate a branch or detoured route of that Interstate. Some of these detours go completely around a city, forming a huge ring. Toronto needed something like that about 10 years ago, and it&#8217;s only gotten worse since.<br />
Like most of the Interstates in the New Orleans area, the I-310 was raised above the swamps. (What is it with humanity building cities on swamps?) The highway was pieced together in sections about 50 feet in length. Each section was slightly bowed, creating slight peaks at the seams. The result was a constant thump-bob motion for the entire trip into New Orleans. If the peaks were a little higher, someone might have gotten seasick.<br />
Along both sides of the Interstate were tall swamp trees (don&#8217;t ask me the species, the only vegetation I&#8217;m familiar with in swamps are Spanish moss and mangrove trees), creating a beautiful wall of deep green. The blue sky above us, the white concrete in front, and the green to the sides made the final stretch into New Orleans seem like scene out of The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy was easy to figure out, Dhar was the Tin Man (he had the brains, and two encounters of the dangerous kind pretty much eliminated him from the Lion round), Stefan was the Lion (again, the brains were there), and I the Scarecrow (with reasons following soon). One thing was certain &#8212; we weren&#8217;t in Kansas anymore.<br />
Almost without warning, the swamps parted and we found ourselves surrounded with civilization once again. Thus began the next major issue for us to decide: where to stay. There were two KOAs in New Orleans, west and east of the city centre. We read the descriptions, viewed the maps and checked out the features of each. It took a bit of debate, but we decided that the east KOA would provide us with the best facilities.<br />
Little did we know that the east KOA was over 45 minutes from the side of New Orleans that we were entering from. We cruised through seven miles of non-descript urbanization before the I-10 curved south towards the downtown core. At this point, unbeknownst to us, was the I-610 which provided a shortcut through the eight mile &#8216;U&#8217; shaped loop of the I-10. This I would have liked to have known about, since I was to become rather frustrated with the distance we were traveling.<br />
The loop took us at its most southerly point past the Superdome, then passing about a mile or so northwest of the French Quarter. Along the route we got several good looks at the above ground cemeteries which are well-known in New Orleans. There were several reasons for the above-ground burials, varying from problems with the Black Plague, to level of the water table under the soil (which is mostly marshy in that area of the Mississippi delta). No matter what the reason, it&#8217;s still trÃ¯ ¿ ½s creepy.<br />
We drove further and further away from downtown, and I began to wonder just how close this KOA was to the French Quarter, as the ad in the KOA guidebook claimed. Then before us came a causeway across the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, a lake north of New Orleans. The causeway is over eight miles long, yet it isn&#8217;t the record holder. That goes to a sister causeway over the middle of Lake Pontchartrain, which is over 23 miles across.<br />
We exited the I-10 at Slidell, and headed east on either Highway 190 or a side road, I can&#8217;t remember which, until we reached the New Orleans East KOA campground. It was a beautiful campground, surrounded and speckled with huge deciduous trees, casting shade all over the area. I was immediately surprised to see all the tents and RVs, and wondered what the devil was going on. To that point in the trip, we had managed to avoid all the tourists and traffic &#8230; a sudden burst like that was most disturbing.<br />
Despite the incessant pressure in my bladder, I held fast behind the wheel while Stefan and Rebecca (quickly joined by Dhar) ran inside the office to see if we could get a camping spot for the night. It seemed to take far too long to acquire the information we needed, but eventually Dhar appeared to inform me that the camp was totally full, and the New Orleans West KOA had only a couple slots left. I told Dhar to make sure one of those slots was reserved before we hauled our asses back nearly 50 miles to the other side of the city.<br />
As our luck had it, we had arrived on a very auspicious day &#8212; the last day of the New Orleans Jazz Festival &#8230; the last day for that particular weekend, that is. The Festival would resume the following Friday night. It explained why all the camping spots were taken, and it was our good fortune that a spot could still be found at the other KOA.<br />
Good fortune or not, I was getting really grumpy. I was tired and annoyed that we had to travel another half hour before I could take a whiz. Okay, not entirely true, but that was the way I viewed it. Furthermore, I was especially pissed off at the description for the New Orleans East KOA. It had said that it had the &#8220;easiest access to the French Quarter&#8221;. This meant a shuttle bus to downtown New Orleans. We were under the impression you could walk there. In essence the ad didn&#8217;t lie, but when we found out the shuttle only ran when there was enough interest to warrant a trip, the grey area between a lie and a truth suddenly got a lot thinner.<br />
And so we doubled back on our route, crossing over the seemingly endless causeway, missing the I-610 shortcut due to a lack of knowledge, viewing the Superdome from a different direction, and finally arriving at Williams Boulevard about a half hour later. Here we turned south until we reached Jefferson Highway (nothing more than a four-lane city thoroughfare). We headed east along the Highway for about a mile or so before finding the KOA on the north side of the road.<br />
The New Orleans West KOA wasn&#8217;t nearly as nice as the East KOA, but it had two things the East KOA didn&#8217;t have: a regular shuttlebus and a space for us to park. We didn&#8217;t ever use the shuttlebus, but the fact that it was there was of some importance to us. Stefan ran in and got us checked in fairly swiftly. Arriving at 19:00 gave us the rare opportunity to make normal registration.<br />
Unfortunately, the only spot left that had both water and electricity also had sewage, which we didn&#8217;t need (nor could we reach with such a short waste hose). We parked and immediately set about having a swim and a shower before figuring out what we were to do with the rest of the day. This meant a quick run to the toilet for myself before my bladder emptied onto my shorts.<br />
Having quieted the call of nature, I proceeded to make my way towards the pool. I was, admittedly, a little distracted as I left the washroom. This KOA had a very interesting arrangement for the washrooms and the showers. A long hallway running the width of the building provided access to all the facilities. Entering from the west side, the men&#8217;s washroom was immediately to the left, the women&#8217;s washroom further down on the left, and a half dozen doors were on the right. These doors were the showers, and there was no distinction between male and female.<br />
Two of the showers were in use. I stood there for a moment, knowing full well I had heard Stefan, Rebecca, and Dhar come in through the outer door. Then, in the second shower from the outer door, I heard two voices &#8230; Rebecca and Stefan. I shook my head, laughed to myself, and proceeded towards the pool.<br />
The pool was already populated by a large German woman and two young children, a boy and a girl. I paid them no attention (they politely reciprocated) and promptly fell ungracefully into the pool. Instantly half the stress that had built up over the course of the previous 24 hours vanished in an instant. I swam two lengths, and then bobbed in the shallow end.<br />
A few minutes later, I was joined by Rebecca and Stefan, having finished their bathing. They had decided to have a shower before entering the pool, worried more about the grime they had than the chlorine smell they would take out with them. I was opting to get rid of both of the elements with my shower.<br />
Dhar appeared, fully dressed (he didn&#8217;t seem to like water very much), and announced he was renting a car. The bus would arrive shortly and he would return with transportation. This action of his worried me a fair bit: were we disturbing him in some manner?, was I disturbing him in some manner? I didn&#8217;t know whether or not I was the only one a bit puzzled by the whole fiasco, so I just kept my big mouth shut.<br />
The three of us just floated in the cool water, allowing us the break we needed in an otherwise hectic trip. Already we knew that we were traveling far too quickly, and for once I agreed with several other people that we weren&#8217;t taking enough time to do the trip properly. But as far as we were concerned, it was a taste of America, and we could tell where the best places to go when we went down the next time.<br />
A few times Stefan got stuck on his sentences, which I found a tad peculiar. After Stefan managed to sort himself out, he explained that he had been listening to the German woman speak to the children. Being German by birth and raised with the German language, Stefan&#8217;s ears were trained to listen for the familiar tongue. Still speaking it with his parents, Stefan also regularly uses German. While well naturalized for Canada, Stefan still stumbles when his brain tries to shift gears from English to German.<br />
Ten minutes after falling ungracefully into the pool, I forced myself out to have my shower. I walked the short distance to the front of the KOA office and went in the washroom door. For no particular reason, I walked into the second shower stall and prepared to clean myself. In the left hand corner of the room, next to the door, was a used yellow condom.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;d seen a used condom, it probably won&#8217;t be the last. For a moment, I wondered if it was Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s. I stared, half of me wanting to see if it was still warm, the rest of me yelling at the other half for thinking of something so repulsive. I immediately felt a little annoyed that someone would leave it sitting there, and I refused to believe that Stefan and Rebecca would be so inconsiderate.<br />
I then started feeling very alone. I was a single guy. I&#8217;d been that way over 23 years. I&#8217;d never been on a real &#8220;date&#8221;, never kissed a girl, never done anything that would suggest a &#8220;social life&#8221; of any kind. Most of the time, when the subject came up, it became a big joke for me. &#8220;Oh don&#8217;t worry &#8217;bout me,&#8221; I&#8217;d tell employers when they asked insane deadlines of me, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a social life to screw up.&#8221; Everyone would laugh and I&#8217;d get down to work.<br />
But there I was. Naked, and staring at a recently used condom. I still find it amazing at how a little piece of latex rubber can make a guy feel so damned insecure. I started questioning myself &#8212; why was it I couldn&#8217;t &#8220;pick up&#8221;? Too shy? Maybe. Too forward? Possibly. Too weird? Definitely. Too intense? That was the claim from several of my close friends. The only problem there for me is: how do I act any other way?<br />
I thought about that discarded prophylactic throughout most of my shower. For some totally morbid but known reason, I wanted so badly to know where it came from. As I left the shower room, I started to put the thought out of my head. We had things to do that night, and I didn&#8217;t want something as depressing as old memories of opportunities lost dwelling on my mind.<br />
I returned directly to the van, where Stefan and Rebecca had already gone, and proceeded to find out what we were doing for the rest of the night. Dhar hadn&#8217;t yet returned from the car rental agency, so the three of us took the initial planning steps: visit the French Quarter. Planning took about ten seconds.<br />
At a little after 20:00, Dhar returned with his rented blue Chrysler Neon. Dhar hated it. But the Neon was the only car left in the lot that fit Dhar&#8217;s requirements. A dedicated driver, Dhar was quick to point out all the flaws in the car: the transmission was like a &#8220;tin box&#8221;, closing the doors only sounded good with the windows up, the construction seemed flaky, and so on and so on and so on&#8230; I found out later that for fun, Dhar would rent cars on the weekends and drive them around. I took this to mean that Dhar knew his automobiles.<br />
Dhar seemed up for the trip downtown, but I will admit he didn&#8217;t seem too chipper. We filed into the Neon, Dhar and I in front, Rebecca and Stefan in back, and we went to see how long we could drive before getting hopelessly lost. The first thing we noticed about the Neon was how low it sat. The Behemoth received its name in part from its size &#8212; we could see over most vehicles on the road. In the Neon, we suddenly felt very vulnerable because every vehicle was taller than ours.<br />
We drove east on Jefferson Highway, which by that point was part of Highway 90. Exiting from Metairie (a suburb of New Orleans), we entered New Orleans proper and the road became Claiborne Avenue. We followed the road around and through several areas of houses and industry before finding our way to the I-10 again. We drove along it briefly before exiting at Canal Street to head south into downtown.<br />
Here was our second dismal job of navigating. Rebecca (the &#8220;most responsible&#8221; person on the trip) was guiding us using a couple of maps we had brought along. However, Stefan became frustrated when we began to get lost in all the one-way roads. (Dhar and I were reading off road signs as we drove.) What ensued was a small argument before we finally figured out that Canondelet Street became Bourbon Street when it crossed Canal Street. (Got that?) This was after a few very hasty (and probably illegal) U-turns Dhar managed to pull when we weren&#8217;t looking. This countered a suggestion given to us by one of the KOA staff &#8212; if you missed a left-hand turn in downtown, pull three right turns to get you where you wanted to go &#8230; pulling a left-hand turn would get you a nice fat traffic ticket (you could hardly ever turn left into a one-way road down there).<br />
After what seemed an eternity, we entered the fabled French Quarter. It was teeming with Jazz Festival revelers, most of them quite inebriated. As I would comment later on in that evening, I had never in my life seen so many drunken people before in my life. As I would also add, following that statement: &#8220;When in Rome&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Dhar drove down several roads and alleys before we found the parking garage of the Omni Royal Hotel. Dhar picked up the tab for the parking (he also picked up the tab for the car rental), and we began to wander about the mythical French Quarter.<br />
The French Quarter dated back to the founding of New Orleans in 1718. Many of the brick and plaster buildings still possessed French architectural styles of the period. When the Spaniards took over in 1762, they brought their style to the area as well, leaving their mark in the ornate lace terraces that still overlook the streets. A post-Spanish addition are porcelain plaques pasted to the walls of buildings on street corners bearing the Spanish names of the streets.<br />
Hunger was the driving force for us. We hadn&#8217;t eaten since breakfast that morning, and we were well beyond peckish. (Stefan and I were downright famished.) Finding Bourbon Street, we wandered down its length looking for a suitable establishment to dine at. The selection of restaurants was overwhelming. Lined on either side of the street (which was a pedestrian street for about a half mile) were either restaurants, hotels, bars, or small shops. In the street was about half the tourists in New Orleans, in various states of drunkenness.<br />
It took me a minute to realize that we were really walking on Bourbon Street. All I had ever heard of the famed road came back to me in a sudden flood, and for a moment I felt a little disappointed. It wasn&#8217;t the Bourbon Street I had pictured in my mind. I guess I should blame my vivid imagination for that. Most of my views came from Sting&#8217;s Moon Over Bourbon Street from his The Dreams of Blue Turtles album. I expected cobblestone roads, gas light lamps, a near constant haze about the streets, dingy little shops and music halls mixed in with small French eateries.<br />
What we got were a few high-rise buildings near Canal Street, a well-paved road, concrete sidewalks, fairly large and clean stores, bars and, restaurants, and completely clear air &#8212; almost the opposite of what I had in mind. One thing that did stand out was the smell &#8212; decaying garbage and vomit. Pretty much what you&#8217;d expect from a heavily used and abused area of the city.<br />
The first restaurant we tried was a more upscale place, which turned people away by politely stating there was a 45 minute wait. This prompted us to walk further east. Oyster bars were prevalent throughout the French Quarter, which I ruled out as a possibility &#8212; there&#8217;s no way in hell they were going to get me to eat a raw oyster. And I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having Stefan and Rebecca load up on aphrodisiacs with me sleeping 10 feet away from them.<br />
Eventually we found a hip little joint called Remoulade. Slightly away from most of the boozers in the road, the little restaurant gave us a little bit of shelter from the storm. I was still a little apprehensive of the place, but in retrospect I was apprehensive about the entire French Quarter. Like Las Vegas, it was a new experience that required a little bit of adjustment for me. It wasn&#8217;t long before I felt at home there.<br />
Our table was closer to the back of the restaurant, but we still had an excellent view of the entire restaurant (complete with pictures of their all-seafood cartoon band) and Bourbon Street. Authentic Naw&#8217;lins (say it aloud, say it proud, and you&#8217;ll discover the &#8220;proper&#8221; pronunciation of the fair city) cuisine was the order of the night: Jambalaya for Stefan, Shrimp Creole for Dhar, Red Beans for Rebecca, and Blackened Chicken for yours truly. The drinks came quickly too &#8212; gin fizz, planters punch, and a long island iced tea.<br />
Not personally fond of mixed drinks, I flipped through the list of beers. Not finding anything that particular thrilled me, I asked the waitress what she recommended. It was then I heard of Abita Turbodog. I had never heard of anything like that before in my life. Mind you, I had only been drinking since late on December 31, 1995 so my experience in beer wasn&#8217;t too in-depth. A little more than curious about the name, I asked what it was. All she had to say was &#8220;dark beer&#8221; to whet my interest.<br />
To this day, I have not had as fine a beer as Abita Turbodog. When the waitress said it was a dark beer, she wasn&#8217;t kidding. The only beverage I&#8217;ve had that comes close is Guinness. But that&#8217;s a stout, and has a much more bitter taste. Turbodog was dark, strong, and smooth. It was a damn good beer, and I&#8217;m disappointed that Abita doesn&#8217;t ship the stuff up here.<br />
The food arrived not long after we had our drinks. I couldn&#8217;t help but stare at the immense pile of orangey-brown rice, shrimp, and vegetables that made jambalaya. Suddenly gathering up enough guts (probably in part to the high alcoholic content of the beer), I asked Stefan if I could snitch one of his shrimp.<br />
To this day my parents testify that when I was a wee babe, I stuffed anything and everything in my mouth. If it was edible (and in a few cases that wasn&#8217;t even necessary), I ate it. As I got older, I started hating things. For a while, there was very little I would willingly eat. I still don&#8217;t like olives, mushrooms, or liver. Of seafood, I only ate fish. That is, until I was tricked into eating linguini with clams. Since then I&#8217;ve also tried cooked oysters (in a stir-fry) and squid. But a shrimp seemed beyond my ability. They just looked too creepy crawly to eat &#8230; kinda like eating a large beetle.<br />
Nevertheless, I stared at the small orange and white curl, opened my mouth, and tossed the sucker in before I could have a second thought. I chewed on it a moment, swallowed, took a swig of beer to counter the sudden burst of fire in my mouth from the Cajun spice in the jambalaya, and announced that it was bearable. I suddenly realized that when my family found out, I&#8217;d never hear the end of it. (My sister especially took fun in bugging me about my little experiment.)<br />
The only complaint of our dinner was Dhar&#8217;s long island iced tea &#8212; it was brutally strong. Being a gentlemen, he swallowed the rest of it without much ado and ordered something different &#8230; a lime daiquiri.<br />
Our meal completed without dessert, there was nothing there that really appealed to me. Of course I was beginning to feel the effects of the beer by that point, which probably affected my judgment. Correction: I know it affected my judgment. Having finished the beer and debating on buying another, the others tried to convince me to have a mixed drink. I had already forgotten the adage: &#8220;Beer then liquor, never sicker&#8221; so I had nothing else to hold me back in my decision (the rest of my higher logic functions having taken a nose dive after the Turbodog).<br />
And so arrived another lime daiquiri. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of it at first, but the taste was something else. I like tart food and drink, so something sour usually appeals to me. I sucked back that alcoholic slushie like it was nothing more than a lime-flavoured ice cone. That was my second bad move for the night (the first having given in to having a mixed drink).<br />
Having only started drinking anything alcoholic at New Year&#8217;s left me with a decidedly significant disadvantage &#8212; I had no tolerance for booze. I would feel a buzz after only one beer. After two I started feeling numbness in my face. After three I couldn&#8217;t feel my nose. After four I couldn&#8217;t walk properly. After five I was a lost cause and needed to be protected (though usually from myself). After one strong beer and a lime daiquiri, I was at the three beer mark.<br />
Actually, I was a little past the three beer mark. I&#8217;d lost some of my coordination, but oddly enough I could still feel most of my face (although it was well numbed). We worked our way back into the street to mingle with the rest of the drunks and wandered around Bourbon Street. I had wished two things almost immediately: 1) that we had arrived a day earlier to catch some of the Jazz Festival, and 2) that I could come back again with my more musically-oriented friends (who lived for that kind of thing). I&#8217;m not saying that Stefan, Dhar, and Rebecca were bad company, just different.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where my memory gets a tad on the cloudy side. I don&#8217;t know exactly what we did after we left Remoulade. All I truly remember was it wasn&#8217;t even 22:00 when we reentered Bourbon Street. We wandered in one (possibly several) directions, looking in stores, bumping into people, and watching some of the oddest behaviour I&#8217;d ever seen.<br />
Take this little game for example: usually occurring at Mardi Gras, this little erotic game involves women exposing their breasts to men, in return for beaded necklaces. Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Where do I sign up? I had to admit, I was shocked. All these years of the National Organization for Women cramming down our throats that women are equals, not objects and blah blah blah blah blah. I had accepted all that hot air when I was knee-high to a dust mite! This little act was sending NOW&#8217;s work back 30 years.<br />
Rebecca was particularly interested in the game (she&#8217;d heard of it from a friend of hers, who had participated when she had visited New Orleans), watching the spectacle with keen interest. (I guess this is what sex experts do when they see something sexual. I guess this would also apply to men, who look anyway.) For a brief moment, I actually thought that Rebecca was about to join in the fun. For a brief moment I hoped that she would, if only to see the expression of utter horror on Stefan&#8217;s face.<br />
Voodoo shops are creepy places, and the French Quarter&#8217;s got a few of them. Whether or not the proprietors believe in the religion or not is hard to say, but the signs pasted all around the store seem to indicate as such. Jars of shrunken &#8230; things, voodoo dolls, potions, powders, wands, rubber chickens (don&#8217;t ask me), and a lot of stuff I wasn&#8217;t too comfortable looking at, let alone buying them.<br />
Sex shops abounded in the area, with probable reason. Naturally, tagging along with a sex expert, we had to do some field research. I swear Rebecca sounded like a school girl, giggling at some of the things she hadn&#8217;t seen before. Most of the stuff was old hat for her, she rifled through the clutter like she had intimate knowledge of what the stuff was. Dhar couldn&#8217;t bear being those stores very long, and would quietly leave, waiting for us either on the street or in another store nearby.<br />
The other streets near Bourbon street weren&#8217;t spared our perusal. Heaven only knows how long we stumbled around &#8230; rather, I stumbled around &#8230; until we arrived at the foot of Orleans Avenue. In front of us was St. Anthony&#8217;s Garden, and just past that the St. Louis Cathedral. At night there&#8217;s not a heck of a lot to see, except for a statue.<br />
A simple pose of Jesus Christ with his arms extended. In front of the statue was a bright white light, which when shone at the statue formed an enormous shadow on the front of the cathedral. It was a powerful image, and one that didn&#8217;t escape my camera lens. If I ever return to New Orleans, I intend to retake that picture having had a little more practice at night shots.<br />
We walked hardly a block before we spotted a store where all the merchandise sported a blue dog. I, still under the influence, muttered quite loudly: &#8220;What&#8217;s with the blue dog?!&#8221; We were quickly answered by passing African-American man (also under the influence) who told us the history behind the dog. It was apparently the pet of the owner, also an artist, who began painting a blue likeness of the dog. The locals seemed to like it, and eventually the dog became local lore. Go figure&#8230;<br />
From there we found the building in which the Louisiana Purchase was signed. But I neither remember what the name of the building was nor where it was in the French Quarter. We milled around for a few moments and then headed to Canal Street. We walked up Canal Street back towards Bourbon Street, Dhar and Stefan stopping several times at the closed electronics shops (it was a Sunday, after all). Dhar was keen (bordering on desperate) to buy a new radar detector for his car.<br />
I never really understood the reasoning for a radar detector. Unless you happen to be a professional race car driver, I don&#8217;t see any reason why you should speed excessively. Driving 20 km/h over the speed limit I don&#8217;t consider excessive (seeing as all Canadians seem to do that), but most people buying a radar detector tend to travel much faster than that.<br />
Following more wandering, we eventually found our way back to the parking garage where we left the car. While we waited for the valet to retrieve our vehicle (it was a posh French Quarter hotel, after all), I got a good look around. The most interesting feature of the garage was the lift (you couldn&#8217;t quite call it an elevator). It was a vertical conveyor belt that ran to the upper levels of the garage. Every eight feet or so was a platform that stuck out about a foot. Valets would stand on the platform and be carried upwards. The device was devilishly simple, and judging by the motor running it, also very old. Not terribly safe either, one false move and you could lose a arm or leg &#8230; even a head.<br />
The blue Neon reappearing from the depths (or in our case, heights), we filed back into the car and tried to find our way home. I don&#8217;t know who was navigating (Dhar was driving), but we ended up on a road heading east. Not the proper direction, you say? Correctimundo! We came to the same conclusion when we found the oil refinery. Somehow we got turned around and drove in the opposite direction. That mystery solved, Dhar turned around and got us going the right way.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly what route we took, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say we didn&#8217;t take the Interstate. Eventually we found our way back to Jefferson Highway (why do I keep wanting to type &#8216;Jefferson Airplane&#8217;?) which ultimately led us back home to the Behemoth. It was past midnight by the time we got in, and most of the campground had settled in for the night. A few stragglers from the Jazz Festival were still up.<br />
Dhar pulled up in front of the van, and three of us filed out. Dhar then pulled out and drove off, explaining that he wasn&#8217;t tired and wanted to see more of the city. He had pre-purchased his gasoline, and wanted to use as much of it as possible. So he said. If I had been a little more sober, I might have been a little more concerned. But by that time, I was a little more focused on going to sleep.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate Supplementary</strong><br />
Despite a strong beer (#23) and my first lime margarita, I&#8217;m able to write this. Tonight I experienced the French Quarter. Somehow, I had a totally different idea of Bourbon Street than what we found. I ate a shrimp and actually like it &#8211; my parents will be freaked. Dhar went off on us again &#8211; it must be nice to be a vampire&#8230;More and more I hate being single. I need only watch Stef and Rebecca to see what I&#8217;m missing. It&#8217;s become truly sad when the &#8220;jokes&#8221; I make are based in truth.

		<p>The morning was cool, but not uncomfortable. Dhar had slept in the navigator&#8217;s chair again, but for once wasn&#8217;t awake before me. Not having relieved myself the night before, my bladder was now rather tight feeling, the call of nature was screaming in my eardrums. As quietly as possible, I climbed out of the van (possible only because Dhar wasn&#8217;t blocking the side doors) and hiked down to the KOA Office.<br />
The KOA office was a fairly large two-storey building. The front was the office itself, facing the road. At the back of the office were the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s washrooms and a pool (also closed for the season). I found this closure rather interesting considering the camp looked rather full, and the limited facilities were sure to cause problems.<br />
I first went to the washroom door to see if it was locked during the day. As I reached it, the door swung open and one of the other KOA guests left. I shoved my foot in the door and headed directly to the urinal. Feeling less pressured and bit lighter, I went around to the other side of the building to find the office.<br />
A husband and wife team ran the camp, the wife sounding like an immigrant from England. I politely asked for the washroom combination so the others could get in when they woke up. I explained that we had arrived during the night, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to use the facilities yet. (Which was essentially true.) The woman understood completely and provided me with the important information.<br />
By the time I got back the others were rising. It was shower time. I grabbed my things and headed off to cleanse myself of several hundred miles of grime. The showers were best described as &#8220;weird&#8221;: they had all the necessary fixtures, with cinder block dividers between the three stalls. No, that isn&#8217;t the strange part. Unlike all the other places we stopped, the dividers didn&#8217;t extend all the way to the wall, leaving a foot-wide gap and allowing one person to see into the adjacent stall.<br />
Hello? Who on earth would do something like that? More importantly, why?<br />
I took the middle stall (for no particular reason), and was joined on either side by Stefan and Dhar about five minutes later. All three of us joked about the rather odd construction of the showers. Cleaned and dried, I headed back to the van to carry out the rest of the morning&#8217;s duties. These included emptying and refilling the fresh water tanks (the newness of the plastic tended to lend a rather unpleasant taste), getting the seats back in their original positions, and buying more postcards to send home.<br />
Albuquerque isn&#8217;t exactly the garden spot of New Mexico, but it&#8217;s a nice place (I just wouldn&#8217;t want to live there). Trees and small plants gave some shade within the campgrounds (although not a tenth as nice as the campground in Las Vegas, but better than the ones in Colorado), amidst the wilting and dried out grass. But the grass next to the van would look nice within a week or so of us leaving, the additional water would help replenish the moisture.<br />
A knock at one of the doors announced the arrival of one of the KOA staff. He informed us that we moved during the night, to which I vehemently (but politely) insisted we hadn&#8217;t. After a brief explanation of what happened when we arrived, the middle-aged and overweight man apologized, suggesting that someone else had created some confusion, and went off to find out who.<br />
This was only the first encounter of less-than-average intelligence at that KOA that morning. I don&#8217;t know if it was just the staff, or if it was the result of living in New Mexico. Either way, there were some seriously intelligence impaired people working there.<br />
My next encounter was buying postcards. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so bad, but when I got around to buying stamps things went to hell in the proverbial hand-basket. Everywhere else we had been had required $0.40 to send a postcard to Canada. Yet for some reason the English woman insisted that the cost was $0.50. I assumed one of two things: 1) Because of Albuquerque&#8217;s remoteness, the cost was slightly higher, or 2) The cost had gone up in the past couple of days. I pretty much ruled out the second possibility, since Americans would have a fit over a 10 cent increase in postage. The first possibility wasn&#8217;t particular plausible either as far as I was concerned, but an extra $0.40 overall wasn&#8217;t going to destroy my budget.<br />
As it turns out, the stamps were supposed to cost $0.40, as Rebecca found out when she bought stamps about a half hour later. (The woman would later apologize for her mistake.) But I wasn&#8217;t the only one to have to deal with all the strange goings-on that morning. When Stefan went in to get the late check-in squared away, he also had to deal with what appeared to be a rash of moronic behaviour. Some of the aforementioned demeanor was the result of a guest leaving the campground and returning to a different spot, messing up all the scheduling and reservations, and pissing off a motorhome arriving for its reservation.<br />
Breakfast that morning was oranges and the last of our fruity loops (the equally as sugary Kellogg&#8217;s knock-off). Having four people crammed around the table in the back of the van was not a wise idea &#8212; there was hardly any elbow room, virtually no leg room, and if you had to get out you were pretty much screwed unless you were the last person in.<br />
We wasted little time, and pulled out just before 11:00. On directions from the KOA clerks (surprisingly accurate ones), we traveled north along Juan Tabo Boulevard to find the Valvoline lube shop, about a mile or so north of the I-40. Stefan&#8217;s keen eyesight picked it out at a fair distance, and soon enough we were parked around the back waiting our turn in line.<br />
There seemed to be a large number of people wanting to change their oil that morning. I had hoped for a simple drive-in, drive-out spending all of about 20 minutes. Unfortunately there were two cars ahead of us in both bays, meaning that at best we were there for at least 40 minutes. So we sat back, listened to the radio, and waited.<br />
One of the oil jockeys came out after a few minutes and had me fill out some information about the van. This necessitated a quick flip through the owner&#8217;s manual to make sure I got the information correct. Another jockey had an elderly man in a pickup truck and us switch sides to keep the order of first-come, first-serve in perfect shape.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca went off to find coffee and camera film. I needed film, and asked Dhar to grab some for me, and I&#8217;d pay him back later. To keep in check with the film I had used so far, I asked for Kodak film, preferably 400 ASA. I got my 400 ASA, but it was Fuji instead. I don&#8217;t mind Fuji film, but I&#8217;ve always believed Fuji film takes different pictures than Kodak film.<br />
Only moments following Rebecca and Dhar&#8217;s return to the van our turn came for an oil change. Guided by one of the half-dozen high school dropouts (or so their appearance seemed to be) that ran the place, although in a very professional manner, I drove the Behemoth into place over one of the massive oil changing pits. There seemed to be almost a military manner about the way business was carried out: precise motions, strong team dependence, and a curious habit of repeating yelled orders so that every employee was aware of what was going on even if that employee wasn&#8217;t directly involved.<br />
The hood was popped as the oil pan plug was pulled. If there is such a thing as an automotive enema, I&#8217;m certain the Behemoth received one. At first we were all in the van, but almost immediately Stefan and Dhar climbed out to watch the lube jockeys go through their steps.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960427.1175</strong><br />
<em>Day 7</em><br />
We hit Albuquerque late last night and actually managed to sleep in for a change &#8211; 8:45 to be specific. Three hours later, we&#8217;re now changing oil. After that, we&#8217;re getting abducted by aliens. We might get to San Antonio tonight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My father was very specific about the type of oil that was used in any of our family vehicles &#8212; always 15W40 grade. Neither Stefan or Dhar (acknowledged automotive fanatics) could understand it, neither did any of the lube jockeys. To be honest, I never did either. All I knew is that the oil my dad usually put in was made for diesel engines and was excellent at keeping the carbon levels low.<br />
But in the heat of the south, 15W40 is hardly ever used. The most popular grades were literally kept on tap &#8212; three gas pump-style hoses provided quick and easy access to refills. Our rather odd order had to be yelled down to the storage area (although yelled all over the garage at the same time, as if in disbelief that some yahoo was actually ordering such a thick oil), and five quart bottles had to be tossed up.<br />
Everything that moved was greased. Every fluid level was checked. The filters were changed. While we waited for the last of the bottles to be filled, one of the station&#8217;s employees struck up conversation (almost unavoidable when you&#8217;re driving a motorhome with Ontario license plates). Mostly where we had been and where we were going &#8212; standard fare for us by that point. Then he asked us who we thought was going to win the Stanley Cup that year.<br />
Although I immediately answered: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a clue!&#8221;, it took me only a moment to realize the irony of the situation. Here I was, a devout Canadian, from what many believe to be the true home of ice hockey, and I don&#8217;t follow what many would call our national pastime. (As a side note &#8212; hockey is so popular that the theme for CBC&#8217;s Hockey Night In Canada has been repeatedly recommended as our new national anthem, mostly because O Canada doesn&#8217;t sound good at hockey games.) I was in a state where the only ice they probably saw was floating in drinks, yet they eagerly watched hockey.<br />
I guess I&#8217;ve always had this odd objection to warm climates taking a liking to ice hockey. I have this peculiar train-of-thought that says places like Dallas, Miami, and Los Angeles should never be allowed to have a hockey team, especially when needy cold places like Quebec City are more deserving. In my opinion, any place that doesn&#8217;t see snow for more than two months of the year should not be allowed to have an ice hockey team. Yes, I know that proper conditions can easily be maintained in arenas, but that&#8217;s beside the point. It&#8217;s the principle of the matter. Ice is nice.<br />
Anyway, a few minutes later and a $25 charge to my VISA card, we hit the road to see if we could get abducted by aliens. Our major destination of the day was Roswell, about 200 miles south-east of Albuquerque.<br />
For those of you not familiar with the name Roswell, you probably don&#8217;t follow UFO lore. In 1947 newspaper headlines touted the crash of an unidentified flying object &#8212; the first, and most certainly not the last (though probably the most credible) report of any such incident from 1947 to the present day. Theories abound as to what happened. Some, like the US Army, contend that the object was a weather balloon. Others think it was one of the number &#8220;black projects&#8221; the United States government ran (and still run). But X-Files diehards (referred to as X-Philes &#8230; pun intended, I assume) and UFO-ologists believe that the object was a spacecraft of some kind. Many reports also seemed to indicate that passengers were recovered from the ship. But this much is known: the government denies anything other than a weather balloon crashed outside Roswell.<br />
Mind you, until 1995 the United States government also denied the existence of Area 51, a not-so-secret Air Force base at Groom Lake in Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. This is despite many photographs and video, Russian satellite photos, and large groups of people who go to the site to watch &#8220;black projects&#8221; go through their paces. Many in-the-know also believe the crashed UFO and some fully-functional UFOs are stationed at the Groom Lake facility.<br />
I resumed my stint behind the wheel, and we pulled back onto the I-40. This time we headed west again for brief time, until we picked up the I-25 going south. This was by far the easiest and the fastest route, taking about an hour and fifteen minutes to reach Socorro. From there we would take Highway 380 to Roswell. Socorro was also known for some rather interesting activities in the night sky, all denied by the government, of course.<br />
Despite the general lack of just about anything interesting in New Mexico, we managed to find a few objects and places that put the state in my &#8220;Strange Places To Visit&#8221; category (reports of UFOs aside). For starters, there&#8217;s the prison warning signs along the road. We missed the first one we passed, I barely got a good look at it. But we pulled over at the next one we found so I could get a good picture of it:<br />
<q>Do not pick up hitchhikers. Prison facilities.</q>Never before had I seen anything like that. I haven&#8217;t seen anything like that out of New Mexico ever since. Along that same stretch of the I-25, I also saw a VW Bug. Remember them? Yes, I know that&#8217;s not impressive, and I totally agree. The fact that this VW had an enormous pair of bull horns mounted to the roof completely amazed me. Not only did they look absolutely ludicrous on the tiny vehicle, they must&#8217;ve constituted a safety hazard in the event of a car crash.<br />
The desert opened before us very quickly, leaving only the brown and beige vastness to see. The only break in the monotony was the Rio Grande, which the I-25 ran along side. On the banks of the mighty river stood luscious trees and large bushes. The vegetation seemed to form an impenetrable wall, preventing the harsh conditions of the New Mexico wasteland from harming the delicate life giver.<br />
When we turned east onto Highway 380, that little slice of green quickly disappeared behind us. I expected us to start crossing through sandy desert at that point, but was surprised to find many low hills and shallow valleys rippled the land before us. The only indication that we were in or at least very near a desert were a few signs that warned of sandstorms in the area.<br />
But perhaps the most serious sign that we saw was for the White Sands Missile Range. More secretive government work, yes, but not the most significant reason &#8230; at least not for me. I knew that somewhere to the south of Highway 380 was the location of the infamous Trinity Site. There, in the early hours of July 16, 1945, humanity decided to try to beat God at His own game and crack the atom. For a brief instant the sky became brighter than day, and the nuclear age began.<br />
I wanted to see the site. But the AAA TourBook indicated that only two tours were made each year: one at the beginning of April, and one at the beginning of October. The Trinity Site is in the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range, but may still be in an active fire zone. Another possibility is lingering radioactivity, fatal to prolonged repeated exposure.<br />
New Mexico is the birthplace of Smokey the Bear. How did we find this out? We passed by the Smokey Bear Historical State Park. Several signs hinted at a monument of some kind that told the story of the Great Firestomper, but we never found it.<br />
We stumbled across another rather interesting curiousity somewhere between Capitan and Picacho, a distance of about 29 miles. One minute we were passing through a sea of dust, sand and small dark green shrubs, the next minute we were surrounded by a basalt lava flow. All around us was a massive black bumpy patch of rock. We pulled over for a moment t get a good look at it, to make sure we weren&#8217;t seeing things.<br />
Another reason we pulled over was to see if we could find a replacement for our lava rocks in the barbeque. The ones that were supplied with our little grill were horrible, barely large enough to keep from falling between the cracks (and sometimes not). But almost as soon as we pulled into what appeared to be a state park entrance, we saw the rules posted in large friendly letters for all to see: &#8220;Do not remove any rocks from this area.&#8221;<br />
So we pulled back out onto the road. But I pulled out a little too quick, and the CD player slid off the &#8220;doghouse&#8221; (the &#8220;doghouse&#8221; is an extension of the engine housing into the passenger compartment, creating a large bulge between the driver and navigator) and smashed into the floor, breaking the lid off. I was a little annoyed, mostly at myself for pulling out so fast. Fortunately, Dhar the engineer fixed our music supply and returned it to working order. One thing I&#8217;ll say for Sony, their CD players will take a burning, and keep on turning.<br />
A little under a half hour later, we entered Roswell. We didn&#8217;t know when we entered Roswell, as there weren&#8217;t any &#8220;Welcome to Roswell&#8221; signs. Less than a quarter mile after entering what I assume to be the city limits, we found ourselves in a time machine set for the 1950&#8217;s. It seemed aliens had taken over the city and prevented the citizens from building anything new.<br />
Despite the marker of a major city on the New Mexico map, Roswell was really nothing more than a large town of some 45,000 people buried in the middle of the New Mexico desert. Highway 380 formed one of two main roads running through Roswell, the other being Highway 285. Where they crossed, the intersection almost resembled one out of a major city &#8230; only without the traffic. It was one of a small number of intersections with traffic lights.<br />
Roswell seemed dead. There was hardly any life to the place whatsoever &#8212; virtually no moving cars, hardly any pedestrians, no animals or birds that we could see or hear. Even the vegetation looked stunted. Another temporal distortion seemed to surround the city, just like the one in Kansas, only not as severe. Even our breathing seemed to slow slightly. Little did we know that we found the home of unconcern, stoicism, and apathy.<br />
What we were looking for, we didn&#8217;t know. Asking someone about the UFO crash would illicit one of two responses: annoyance (derived from all the other curiousity seekers&#8217; constant badgering), or bewilderment at such a stupid question. So we simply drove along Highway 380 looking for something, anything, that might give a hint as to Roswell&#8217;s infamous past.<br />
In a motion that was nearly suggestive of pregnancy, Rebecca declared that she wanted ice cream. I say &#8216;nearly&#8217; because I was also guilty of such a declaration (even if I didn&#8217;t vocalize it), and medical science still hasn&#8217;t caused pregnancy in men. But do you think that we could find a single ice cream parlour? What it was with Southerners, I don&#8217;t know, but they seemed to have some strange aversion to cold foods.<br />
Before we knew it, the desert reappeared. Half of us wanted to go back to Roswell, and half of us wanted to go forward. So we compromised and continued going forward for a little while. The eastern side of Roswell was certainly more scenic than the western side, but when you compare a scraggly shrub to nothing, the difference is still significant (at least in a mathematical sense). After a few minutes we stumbled across the Bottomless Lakes State Park. The arrival of the dinner hour elicited a group decision to find a place to settle down and eat, and the park seemed as good a place as any.<br />
We turned onto the park road and started driving down its long, winding route. We drove for what seemed like endless miles. We began to wonder if the park had any lakes at all, if they had dried up like all the rivers we had seen in our travels through the dry states. Turn after turn, bend after bend, mile after mile, and nothing but some short grasses and bracken.<br />
But as we rounded a hill after about ten minutes, a body of water came into view. It looked like there was maybe two feet of water in the deepest portion. Evaporation had left huge white and gold rings of mineral deposits where the water had one been. It probably couldn&#8217;t support any life, partly hinted at by the lack of vegetation around the pond (which was pretty much what it was by that point). The park was rapidly beginning to be known as &#8220;Lakeless Bottom&#8221;.<br />
But we did eventually find it, about a mile away from the other lake bed. Oddly enough though, we didn&#8217;t immediately see it &#8212; it was surrounded. On the north side of the lake was a steep cliff. On the west side were trees just tall enough to shield our view. On the east and south sides was a picnic cum trailer park the state park service had erected. Unlike most of the other parks we had visited thus far (excluding the ones containing historical sites), this had a pay-for-use system &#8230; even if you only wanted to use the picnic area. We weren&#8217;t too keen on this aspect, so promptly turned around and hit the road again.<br />
In a few minutes we found ourselves at the top of the cliff on the north side of the lake, and received our first good look. Barely larger than the other dried-up lake we had seen earlier, some 100 to 150 metres in diametre and roughly circular in size, the lake would be considered a pond in most circles. As to its claim as being bottomless, we couldn&#8217;t really tell. It was a dark lake, but even a shallow lake can look dark.<br />
At any rate, the spot was a good place to have dinner. It was a gravel-laid lookout point for the lake next to the park road, surrounded with chain-link fencing to keep visitors from falling down the 80 metre cliff to what would probably be certain death.<br />
I hopped out the driver&#8217;s door, flipped up the running board flap, and turned on the propane. Rebecca delegated herself to cooking dinner &#8212; spaghetti with some mighty spicy tomato sauce. While we ate, several vehicles pulled up, usually families, to look over the cliff to the tiny lake below. Several families of flies visited us directly, an annoyance we could have done without.<br />
Just as we were finishing, a police car showed up. I began to panic. If this doesn&#8217;t say why I don&#8217;t like colouring outside the lines, I don&#8217;t know what does. I&#8217;ve been paranoid of the police for years, and I really don&#8217;t know why. I guess I was frightened that the police would come over and declare we were not supposed to be there, nail us with a large fine, and suddenly decide to search the van. In doing so they&#8217;d stumble across something that wasn&#8217;t supposed to be there, they&#8217;d confiscate the van, and I&#8217;d disappear into some deep dark prison never to see the light of day, and become the plaything for some a 230-pound rapist and mass murderer named Bubba.<br />
Yes, my mind wanders frequently. I often worry that one day, when I&#8217;m not attentive, it will wander into the road and get squished. Then I&#8217;d be in trouble&#8230;<br />
The cops sat there in the patrol car, looking in our general direction, then after a few moments drove off. I breathed a sigh of relief, much to the curiousity of the others, who hadn&#8217;t come close to being fazed by the presence of the long arm of the law.<br />
The dishes and the pots were cleaned, the leftovers heaved in a nearby dumpster. While Dhar and I got the van ready to be rolled out again, Stefan and Rebecca shared a moment outside, staring into the impending sunset, into the vastness of the American south-west.<br />
For some reason unknown to me then, and still a mystery to me now, I wanted to keep driving. It wasn&#8217;t that I hadn&#8217;t tired of driving &#8212; I actually wanted to keep driving. I don&#8217;t know why. But little argument was raised, so I resumed my position and we headed on our way out of the park. Fortunately the way out was much shorter than the way in.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan took refuge in &#8220;their&#8221; place in the back, Dhar rode shotgun. As we reentered Roswell, Stefan came forward and asked quietly if we could keep an eye open for any place that sold ice cream. (He wanted to make sure Rebecca&#8217;s desires were fulfilled.) It was a difficult request to fill, as there were no ice cream parlours of any kind to be found.<br />
No ice cream parlours, but that bastion of American cheap food, brusque service, and blatant commercialism happened to have a branch office in Roswell. We pulled into the McParking Lot(r), went in through the McDoors(r), and waited in the McLobby(r) so one of the under-paid McEmployees(r) with over-applied McMakeup(r) could take our McOrders(r).<br />
Several years ago, the Canadian branches of the McFranchise(r) had switched from milk-based ice cream and milkshakes to low fat versions. This meant the ice cream was now frozen yogurt, something which I considered so artificial I was never keen on eating it. However, in a trip to TCBY a couple years following the switch, I found I didn&#8217;t mind it so much. Ever since, I&#8217;d made quick work of the McHot Fudge Sundaes(r).<br />
What the American branches of the McFranchise(r) use, I have no clue. All I do know is that the McHot Fudge Sundae(r) certainly didn&#8217;t taste like a McHot Fudge Sundae(r). It might have been the fact that the McServer(r) had to scoop the McFudge(r) out of the McDispenser(r) when the McPump(r) broke. Her hand was coated with the chocolate goop, and said goop didn&#8217;t appear normal &#8230; at least to me.<br />
Complaints aside, Rebecca&#8217;s craving was diminished, if not satisfied, and our mission to Roswell had come to a close. Still retaining the driver&#8217;s seat, I took us out of the McParking Lot(r) and drove to Highway 285 for our trip into Texas.<br />
We still hadn&#8217;t quite figured out what we were going to do in Texas. One thing we had all wanted to do was find a beach on the Gulf of Mexico and spend the day soaking in the sun&#8217;s harmful rays, receiving sand mite bites, sucking in polluted salt water, and paying too much for a watered-down Coke. To do this, we were going to drive through the night until we got to Houston, at which point we would head south to the beach. I kept suggesting we visit the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, but received only lukewarm response. This was the extent of our planning.<br />
First things first however, and we still had 92 miles until we even entered the Lone Star State, let alone set course for the beach. The sun was scraping the horizon as we drove south. The sunset was like nothing we had seen on the trip to that point (nor would we see anything like it during the rest of the trip). As it set, the light on the horizon showed us a landscape so flat, it looked almost like a totally calm and smooth lake &#8212; perfectly flat, save for the odd bush that created a small bump. But unlike Arizona or Kansas, the flatness didn&#8217;t bother me. It was oddly calming &#8230; though I wouldn&#8217;t want to see it every day.<br />
With the coming of night came a better view of what was on the horizon. Sounds strange, doesn&#8217;t it? Throughout most of New Mexico that we saw, and probably a good chunk of Texas, were oil wells. Okay, maybe that doesn&#8217;t sound too spectacular, but as you travel down Highway 285, bright spots appear on that flat distant line. Oil wells and refineries, their lights burning through the night sky. The wind only confirmed our conclusions, the smell of petrochemicals could be easily smelled even as far as 60 miles away.<br />
Each night in Carlsbad, about an hour south of Roswell, there is a spectacle that draws huge crowds. At one of the natural entrances to the Carlsbad Caverns, millions of insect-eating bats take to the sky at sunset to feed. Seeing Carlsbad Caverns would have been an interesting addition to the day, and I so desperately wanted to see the bats. Unfortunately for me, and for all of us, the sun had fully set by the time we were less than 30 minutes from Carlsbad. No bats that night.<br />
Or so I thought. In the New Mexico desert, even on a clear night the amount of ambient light is pretty minimal (at least from inside a vehicle). Things along the roads are pretty hard to see. As we reached the area of Carlsbad Caverns, we encountered a few fledermaus. At first it was just glimpses of the winged mice as they avoided colliding with the Behemoth. But a couple of the more adventurous types decided to settle in the roads looking for a meal. I&#8217;m not scared of bats, but when one of those suckers takes off a few feet in front as you travel at 65 mph towards it, you&#8217;re bound to be a little startled.<br />
But nothing was nearly as nail-biting as our encounter of the fuzzy kind. Jack rabbits. Hundreds of them lined the highway. We didn&#8217;t notice them until one shot in front of the van as it crossed to the east side of the roadway. Dhar and I immediately developed rabbit radar, constantly scanning for the furry little buggers. I love nature, I don&#8217;t like driving over top of it, or smacking into it snapping vertebrae.<br />
At first, we thought it was just one or two. But after a couple minutes, we saw hundreds of green glowing eyes peering back from the scraggly grass at the sides of the highway. If we had been characters in a Stephen King novel, I&#8217;d be scared out of my wits at the sight of all those bewitched bunnies. The odd one would hop around, but for some reason most stared at us as we drove by. I suppose it&#8217;s the old &#8220;caught in the headlights&#8221; shtick, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that it&#8217;s still creepy. I could almost hear Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;good evening&#8221; echo in the van.<br />
We weren&#8217;t the only ones who knew the jack rabbits were there &#8212; we spotted a wily coyote prowling for dinner. I figured that with that many rabbits, he (or she) shouldn&#8217;t have too much trouble getting a bite to eat.<br />
The rabbits continued to the New Mexico / Texas border, then seemed to vanish. As we crossed into our 11th state of the trip, Rebecca promptly asked if we had been abducted by aliens. According to our clocks, no time had passed. I couldn&#8217;t find any hole in my memory, nor could anyone else. We all sighed dejectedly &#8212; nobody wanted us.<br />
Highway 285 started into a south-easterly direction once inside Texas. By this time, it was so dark the only way we knew we were in Texas was the sign welcoming us, and the dual speed limits: one for cars, and another for trucks driving at night. At first I assumed that the limits were only for the state highways, since they weren&#8217;t as well protected from animals as the Interstates. As it turned out, the limits were universal.<br />
Then one of the possible reasons came to light &#8212; deer. In Canada, large animals are a problem when driving through the boonies at night. If you&#8217;re not careful, you can say good-bye to your car, and if you&#8217;re particularly unlucky, your life. Moose are the worst problem, they&#8217;ll demolish large buses and walk away unscathed. Deer tend to explode a little more on contact, but are capable of a great deal of damage.<br />
We Canucks are very aware of these dangers (as a country of barely 28 million people and huge expanses of wilderness, we tend to be fairly in touch with nature), but Texans probably need to be reminded that they&#8217;re not invulnerable (as if The Alamo wasn&#8217;t enough of an explanation). Dhar and I still had our radar on full, so we felt pretty safe as we traveled towards the I-10.<br />
I drove until we arrived in Fort Stockton, where we picked up the I-10. It was only our second sign of civilization since Carlsbad. There we filled up with fuel before continuing our trek across Texas. The Flying J gas and convenience stores were becoming a regular sight to us. We could fill up not only on gas, but also on drinks and food for our seemingly endless driving.<br />
Most people told us that the driving would be hell, and we&#8217;d hate all the driving we were doing. To me, that wasn&#8217;t the case. Okay, Kansas and Arizona were hell, but beyond that the driving was actually fairly interesting &#8212; we were seeing parts of the continents we had never seen before. In only a week we had traveled through half a dozen different climates, each one containing a unique beauty.<br />
Texas seemed to have a climate very different from New Mexico. At Fort Stockton, we were over 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, yet the air was terribly sticky from the humidity. This was a new experience for me. Sure, I&#8217;d been to Florida before (see [[Music Trip to Orlando, Introduction|Music Trip to Orlando]]) and felt the ocean&#8217;s influence on the moisture in the air, but Florida is less than 200 miles wide and surrounded by massive bodies of water. Fort Stockton is very much land-locked. I never once expected the air to be so humid so far away from water. If anything, the trip was also becoming very educational.<br />
The gas wasn&#8217;t terribly cheap, but we now knew the reasons why. I paid for the gas (having to turn over my credit card even before beginning to pump gas) while the others made use of the restrooms and purchased more supplies for the odyssey. Then it was my turn to get some sleep. I had been driving for over 10 hours that day, and I was exhausted.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Roswell was uneventful. If we did get abducted, we don&#8217;t remember. We had dinner at Bottomless Lake, which for a while we thought was Lakeless Bottom. (This was partly due to the sheer number of dry river beds we&#8217;ve seen.)Dhar and I navigated through several miles of vicious Texas jack rabbits, vampire bats, wily coyotes and a few of Bambi&#8217;s relatives on our way into Texas. We&#8217;re about 5 hours or so outside of San Antonio.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke to a vaguely disturbing dream about sirens, manifested by emergency vehicles running up and down Las Vegas Boulevard, just in front of our 16th floor window. No sooner than my head cleared enough for me to realize I was awake that I heard a familiar whirring and buzzing, followed by a sharp shutter click and another quick whir. I suddenly realized with a bit of dread that Dhar had just taken my picture. I immediately flipped him my middle finger in response. His response was a cheery &#8220;Too late!&#8221; Stefan and Rebecca fell victim to our early-morning shutterbug a few seconds later.<br />
We moved surprisingly quick that morning, it took half as long to get Rebecca out of bed. We were showered and ready to go downstairs less than forty-five minutes, leaving us an hour and a half before we planned to check out, at 11:30. Prior to leaving for breakfast, we made certain that we packed up all our belongings so all we would have to do is grab our bags and exit the premises. I filled out an &#8220;Express Check Out&#8221; card that I left at Registration just before breakfast, avoiding the hassle of standing in line.<br />
Breakfast was at the buffet, after a ten minute lineup. Rebecca held our places in line while I ventured off to find a bank machine and obtain some cash. I wasn&#8217;t certain whether my card would be able to access the CIBC network properly or not, but I figured it was worth a shot. Figuring that I had spent only $100 in the first five days, I thought another $100 should get me a fair distance further. The machine spat out $100 a moment later.<br />
It spat out a $100 bill. At first I stared at the machine, wondering what moron would fill a bank machine with such large denominations. I actually slapped my forehead when I realized that I was in a casino, where this sort of thing was normal. But $100 was too much for me to carry around as a single banknote. I asked a nearby security guard where I could break the bill into smaller denominations. His look seemed to indicate that he thought I was a moron, but he pointed at the change booth positioned conveniently behind the bank machine. I slapped my forehead again.<br />
Returning to the buffet restaurant, I couldn&#8217;t find Rebecca, Stefan, or Dhar. The latter two appeared a moment later, having browsed a couple slot machines while I was getting money. As it turned out, Stefan was getting money too, winning $6. We ended up having to go in through the exit line to get to Rebecca. A moment later we were sitting at a booth at the back of the room, right next to the buffet tables.<br />
There was only a momentary pause before Stefan and I laid siege to the food. At all-you-can-eat buffets, some people make repeated trips, bringing back small portions of food each time. Stefan and I subscribe to a different philosophy: repeated trips waste calories &#8230; get it all the first time. Being buffet food, I didn&#8217;t expect a gourmet-quality repast, but for a breakfast it wasn&#8217;t too bad. What our breakfast lacked in quality, the buffet made up for with variation &#8212; cereal, fruit, steak, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, ham, hash browns &#8230; an endless sea of morning fare.<br />
We still had 45 minutes of free time before our planned exodus, so we decided to spend the time browsing around. This effectively split the four of us up with Stefan, Rebecca, and Dhar heading to the casino floor, and myself avoiding it. I was getting over my case of Lasvegasitis, and the constant binging and chiming was beginning to grate on my nerves. I opted to do some window shopping instead.<br />
I was determined to leave with some reminder of our stay at Treasure Island, but very little appealed to me. A few years earlier, I would&#8217;ve bought up half a store &#8230; I guess age does affect what you think is neat. At any rate, I browsed through every store in Treasure Island two or three times before visiting another store on an upper level, near the tram to Mirage and the walkway to the parking garage. There I managed to find a dark aquamarine baseball cap with a simple logo on the front.<br />
In finding the illusive store, I also found a piece of technology that I had heard about a couple years earlier on one of the many technology shows I watched on TV. On the escalator leading to the next floor up, riders pass by a large video wall. This in itself isn&#8217;t anything extraordinary, but if you look close you&#8217;ll see directional microphones suspended from the ceiling and jutting from the walls.<br />
Together these elements are used to create an interactive computer effect. Somewhere deep inside Treasure Island is a computer room, and in this room a performer straps himself into a movement apparatus called a &#8220;waldo&#8221;. On the video wall the performer&#8217;s movements become a computer animated cartoon pirate, the voice also supplied by the performer. The microphones pick up the voices of the escalator riders, essentially allowing the performer to have a conversation with the riders. Unfortunately the system was either no longer used, or wasn&#8217;t on during the time I was traveling up and down the escalator.<br />
Just under 45 minutes later I was back in the room, the others waiting for my arrival. We spent little time packing up our things for our journey to the Behemoth. Returning to the lobby, we opted to go out via the parking garage instead of out the front entrance. Dhar commented on the way that the incessant tones of the slots were driving him mad. I knew exactly what he meant.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960426.115</strong><br />
<em>Day 6</em><br />
Leaving Las Vegas. It&#8217;s an interesting place, but only in small doses. Besides, there are a great many more things to see&#8230;<br />
The Hoover Dam is up next, we should be in Albuquerque by tonight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the already hot temperatures, the van was actually fairly cool inside, thanks to the power of the almighty ceiling fan. We stored our gear, checked the oil, and fired up the engine. While we were waiting for the engine to warm up, I checked the battery power to see how much it had been drained in the 20 or so hours we had left it unplugged. Surprisingly, the level wasn&#8217;t terribly low.<br />
It became fairly apparent why the level was so high when I checked the fridge &#8230; it was still set for 110 volt power. I had forgotten to change the power to 12 volt when we left the KOA the day before. I immediately set the fridge for 12 volt to keep it from getting any warmer, and prayed that what perishable food we had in there wouldn&#8217;t go bad.<br />
That problem aside, we pulled out of the parking lot and hit the road. We traveled north on Las Vegas Boulevard to pick up with Highway 93, which would take us back to the Hoover Dam. Along the way we stopped at the Graceland Chapel so Stefan could take a picture of Dhar and Rebecca in front of it. I waited in the van since they were only gone a few minutes. That act started a rash of jokes about Dhar being married to Rebecca. Interestingly enough, the jokes didn&#8217;t seem to bug Stefan much.<br />
And so we hit our first batch of real traffic. Like many places we had traveled through thus far, Las Vegas was doing construction work on the highway, and it was completely tying up traffic. Normally, I hate traffic. I hate it so much I now refuse to drive into Toronto unless it can&#8217;t be avoided (or I know the traffic will be light). But even though I was behind the wheel that morning, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered. About 20 minutes after entering the mess, we were clear on our way.<br />
Nevada looks very different in the day &#8212; mostly brown and beige with a few splotches of green. Leftovers of the Rocky Mountains and its foothills give some texture to the land. Fortunately, the 30 miles from Las Vegas to the Hoover Dam go by fairly quickly.<br />
This time Dhar and Rebecca were awake, and duly impressed with the gorge as we started to travel down the west side of the valley. Although Stefan and I got a good look at the dam some 36 hours earlier, daylight cast a whole new perspective on the massive structure.<br />
We parked in a newly-built parking garage on the Nevada side and strolled across Highway 93 (reduced to a two lane road with a speed maximum of 15 miles an hour) to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. We immediately signed up for a tour of the dam, at a cost of five dollars apiece. At the time I considered this a reasonable price, even if the actual tour didn&#8217;t last as long as I thought it would have.<br />
Starting at the top of the dam, we had to travel down about 600 feet to the river level. The tour group numbered about 50 to 60 people, which could be accommodated in the two immense elevators. Each of the two cars in the cylindrical shaft could carry at least 30 people, and probably closer to 50. (When you&#8217;re crammed in like sardines, trying not to grope the person next to you by accident, and ignoring the increasing heat, you tend not to notice the precise number of people in the elevator.)<br />
At the bottom we were quickly shuffled out to the balcony of the Nevada-side generating bay. Four American football fields in length, the bay was an impressive construction. Eight massive turbine-powered generators ran the length of the bay, with a much smaller ninth generator near the front, providing power for the dam&#8217;s offices, elevators, lights and so forth.<br />
A few minutes of speech from our tour guide (who constantly stepped over her own words and could barely be heard even with the use of a PA system), and she led us down a flight of stairs to the generator bay floor, and out a door to the outside. We were now where the water from the reservoir exited from the penstocks back into the Colorado River. Behind us was the towering dam, an awesome sight from below.<br />
Here we were shown the transformers which took the raw power from the generators and sent it into the electrical grid. The electrical cables ran almost straight up the side of the canyon walls to towers that stood out almost on a 90 degree angle, then into Nevada. The same setup existed on the Arizona side. The wires criss-crossing the valley seemed to form an immense spider&#8217;s web. Only here, it would be the web that killed you, not the spider.<br />
Following a quick schpeal about the transformers, the guide went on to discuss the dam itself. I already knew a fair bit from documentaries I had seen, but seeing it on TV and seeing it in reality are two totally different things. On TV, it seems like an everyday occurrence. Standing about 30 feet above the Colorado River, staring nearly 700 feet to the top of the dam is an unbelievable sight. The dam is so massive that engineers estimate that barring any major catastrophe (such as earthquake registering over 8 on the Richter scale), the dam should last about 2,000 years. Had I heard that on the documentaries, I would&#8217;ve passed it off as over-confidence. Having actually seen it, I think the estimate&#8217;s a bit low.<br />
Dhar had been a little preoccupied with crossing the dam the first time, afraid that it might crack beneath us. Now at the bottom of the gorge, he was even more concerned. Even I was a little apprehensive. But one of the dam&#8217;s design features made Dhar all the more paranoid &#8230; it leaked. At the seams of the concrete forms, you could see the dark telltale marks of water seepage. Another tourist in our group asked about that, the tour guide promised it was designed that way.<br />
The last stop of the tour was some 200 feet into the canyon wall. Here we were led into a room that overlooked the massive penstock pipes. These pipes came down from the intake towers in the reservoir, delivering water to the generator turbines. Some 30 or 40 feet in diametre, and using pins (rivets) that were six inches across, the pipes contained water under so much pressure that the room we stood in vibrated &#8230; and it wasn&#8217;t even directly connected to the pipe.<br />
Here the guide told us how the water is delivered from Lake Mead to the generators, and how the water was diverted while the dam was under constructions. Another interesting fact of Hoover Dam: it has two spillways, designed to take in water in the event of a flash flood. The spillways are each large enough to contain the volume of water that goes over Niagara Falls in one second (5520 cubic metres, or about 194,940 cubic feet).<br />
The tour thus ended. I was a little disappointed that we had seen all there was to see. I wanted to see the control room, or something else that&#8217;s usually &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221;. We were led back to the elevators to take us back to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. We opted not to see the documentary film, but decided to check out the dam for ourselves. We found our way to the Lake Mead side of the dam, where we found a gift shop. Finally I had found tacky stuff. And by tacky, I am referring to mounted heads of the illusive jackalope (a jack rabbit with antelope horns glued on for show).<br />
I purchased a rather huge mug (the only truly tacky thing that I bought during the trip) and a rock from the canyon to give to my soon-to-be-ex-manager at a job I would quit a few days after returning home. (A very long story, summarized in that the job I was supposed to get ended up going to someone else, and I was going to be bussing tables, through no fault of my own. Thanks, but no thanks.) The rock was supposed to be from the Grand Canyon, but I had forgotten to get one. The rock here looked similar in formation (an advantage of having taken geology courses), so I figured I would at least try to pass it off. (I never did find out if she got the rock or not.)<br />
The time came for us to hit the road again, and start gaining hours as we headed east. Stefan and Rebecca went back for the van while Dhar and I walked to Arizona, taking pictures as we went. I finished off the last of a roll of film (as did Dhar), and I took a couple pictures with my panoramic camera. Part of the way across we came by a restroom, which I desperately needed to make use of.<br />
Most of the architecture of the dam was art deco, the style commonly used in the 1930&#8217;s, when the dam was built. Even the washrooms retained the style &#8230; the toilets actually looked like the ones installed in the 1930&#8217;s. I couldn&#8217;t help but comment on this to Dhar when I came out.<br />
A few minutes later we stood on the Arizona side waiting for Rebecca and Stefan to drive by. They barely stopped, just long enough for us to dive in the side door before continuing on. Our next intended stop was to be in Flagstaff.<br />
My dad had drilled into me for years that engine oil needed to be changed every 5,000 kilometres, no matter what. The Behemoth would hit the mark just outside of Flagstaff, making it the ideal place to get an oil change. But first we had to cross over three and a half hours of Arizona, and it was already 14:00 Mountain time.<br />
We drove down to Kingman again, pausing only long enough to hop from Highway 93 to the I-40 to head east. The trip was fairly uneventful, we found various ways to amuse ourselves including playing Stefan&#8217;s favourite song, Sugar Sugar. (This was from my Saturday Morning CD, a compilation of themes from old Saturday morning cartoon shows, remade by current alternative bands.) Previously a song from the Archies, Sugar Sugar was remade by Mary Lou Lord with Semisonic. It was just as sugary-sweet as the original song (no pun intended), and just as evilly catchy. Several times Stefan would unconsciously start humming it, which led to at least one other person humming it, which lead to someone realizing that it was being hummed, which led to conscious thought and the realization that the song was actually very annoying.<br />
We had a reasonably extensive CD collection with us, most of them from my &#8220;store&#8221;. I use the term as a result of all the chiding I received from my friends. At the time of the trip, I had in excess of 435 CDs. An impressive collection perhaps, but no more so than a few people I know who have over 1,200 CDs in addition to endless boxes of LPs and the few hundred-odd cassette tapes.<br />
Long before my family had even bought the Behemoth, I had sent a request to Stefan and Rebecca to decide what music to listen to, sending them a list of every album I owned. I personally had no qualms about what they chose &#8212; my logic was straightforward, whatever they wanted to listen I owned anyway. After a bit of prodding I finally got a list in return that contained what I would consider &#8220;easy-listening&#8221; music. What I didn&#8217;t know was that they listened to music that was as every bit as harsh as some of the music I listened to, and we had many similarities in our likes and dislikes. In theory, I could have grabbed a bunch of CDs at random and it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered.<br />
To give you an idea of what we did listen to, here&#8217;s the list:</p>

<p>There were several other CDs in the pack I brought along, but we never got a chance to listen to them. Several of the albums were chosen by me for a specific contribution to the trip: theme music. ZZ Top was included for their rendition of Viva Las Vegas. The Tragically Hip supplied New Orleans Is Sinking. REM gave us Drive. Unfortunately I had neglected to bring Sheryl Crow (Leaving Las Vegas), any Elvis albums, Paul Simon (Graceland), or Phil Collins (Take Me Home).<br />
About a third of the way across Arizona, we realized our gasoline supply was dwindling fast. We also knew that the western end of Arizona had much higher gas prices than the eastern end. We tried our best to keep the supply running as long as we could, but soon it became all too clear that no matter what we did, we needed fuel and we needed it quickly.<br />
We pulled off at Seligman, some tiny speck on the map, where we hoped there would be an open gas bar. We crossed to the north side of I-40, and turned east onto a small road. Turning left, we headed over to a dusty gas station, in the middle of a small dusty town. There were hardly any trees, virtually no green grass &#8230; there were hardly any people. Except for the ones driving in the replica roadsters. We&#8217;d seen a few of them earlier as we were driving, but couldn&#8217;t understand why there seemed to be so many of them. When we saw the sign, it all came much clearer:<br />
<q> Welcome to Seligman. Birthplace of Historic Route 66. </q>So we were on the infamous Route 66. We didn&#8217;t get any kicks &#8230; except in the ass when we saw the price of gas. But when you&#8217;re too low to know whether or not you&#8217;ll get to the next station, you don&#8217;t quibble about it. Instead we tossed in about $10, praying it would get us to our next stop. We spent only enough time in Seligman to buy the gas and record the fact that we&#8217;d been there. We then peeled rubber to get out of there &#8212; it was a little too backwater for our liking.<br />
We arrived in Flagstaff about 19:00 that evening, which was an hour too late to get an oil change. We didn&#8217;t realize this until we had already spent a half hour searching through phone books for lube garages in the area and drove around trying to find them. Already about 150 kilometres over the 5,000 kilometre mark, I was a little apprehensive about driving any further for fear of damaging a new engine. But staying in Flagstaff overnight meant a delay in our schedule, possibly meaning we would have to sacrifice one of our planned destinations. It was four and three quarter hours from Flagstaff to Albuquerque, a distance I wasn&#8217;t too keen on traveling, but in the long run it was better for us to do so.<br />
With some trepidation, we jumped back on I-40 and continued our eastern haul. We drove for about 40 miles before pulling into one of the Arizona rest stops, about 20 miles west of Winslow. Resting in one of the many vast endless terrains in the south-west, the rest stop intruded as little into the area as possible. The only significant structures were the washroom building and the picnic shelters.<br />
Inhabiting one of the picnic sites, we set up our portable barbeque on one of the concrete tables and fired it up to cook the hot dogs. While we were stopped, I also took the liberty of switching the fridge over to the propane supply to try and drop the temperature. The 12 volt system was really only good for keeping the contents at a specific temperature, you needed the 110 volt supply or the propane supply to really get the fridge cold.<br />
Our picnic site had three partial (non-contacting) walls and a flat roof, all made from poured concrete. Behind us was a small rock formation, bearing a sign to watch for scorpions and rattlesnakes. We neither saw or heard any of the dangerous beasties, but the sign wouldn&#8217;t have been there if the danger wasn&#8217;t real. After eating most of the hot dogs (a fortunate idea, preventing them from going bad), Rebecca and Dhar strolled onto the rocks to look into the setting western sun. Their report stated the view would have been much better if some schmuck hadn&#8217;t built his house next to the rest stop.<br />
We flirted with the idea of locking up for the night and sleeping there. But my sense of rules came back into play again, and I flat-out refused to. I hated playing the asshole, but my inability to &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; pretty much prohibited rebellion. A long list of rules posted at the front of every rest stop prohibited camping overnight. A truck pulling an Airstream trailer wasn&#8217;t so picky, they had dropped anchor for the night and didn&#8217;t appear to be moving any time before morning.<br />
The sun had set almost entirely by the time we pulled back onto the I-40. What light that was left cast some of the most beautiful deep red light onto the rock and sand, it looked like we were driving over an open wound in the Earth&#8217;s skin.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
So much for oil changes &#8211; by the time we got to Flagstaff all the lube shops and gas stations had closed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We had dinner at one of the Arizona rest stops tonight. We had to be on the watch for rattlesnakes and scorpions. We didn&#8217;t see any. 280 miles to Albuquerque.</p></div>
<p>It took only a few minutes for us to get bored. Driving across Arizona was in many respects like driving across Kansas &#8212; it was so dull your brain doesn&#8217;t work properly. As such, my memory of crossing Arizona the second time is rather non-existant. Though most likely we gabbed for a good portion of the distance. Either that or Stefan and Rebecca went to sleep, Dhar drove and I rode shotgun. (It was a commonly enough done theme that I tend to forget when it was done.)<br />
At midnight, we were possessed with a serious case of the munchies. Barely inside New Mexico, we pulled into the first major city would could find. Gallup was hardly major by our standards, a population of only 19,200, but when considered the population of New Mexico was only 1.5 million and most of the cities had less than 100,000 residents, Gallup became a fair bit more significant than in other places of the country.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t eat anything that we were carrying with us, the only thing we had left were uncooked potatoes (and although mashed potatoes are always a welcome meal, we didn&#8217;t have any way of cooking them quickly), a little bit of salsa (which despite the fact that I don&#8217;t eat salsa, we had nothing for it to go with), and a couple boxes of President&#8217;s Choice White Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese Dinner (a much fancier version of Kraft Dinner). Suffice to say, none of us were in the cooking mood.<br />
Rebecca wanted KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), to which Dhar was objecting (with good reason). I wasn&#8217;t that hungry, so I played indifferent to the whole deal. But by the time we found a KFC, we found it had already closed. A McDonald&#8217;s lurked nearby, so we opted to buy something from there instead. The lobby looked closed, so we pulled into the drive-through and sat next to the speaker waiting for someone to take our order.<br />
And we sat. And sat, and sat, and sat. After about ten minutes it was becoming pretty damn clear that no-one was going to take our order. A car in front of us seemed to have already given an order, and was waiting for the order to be filled. Our little lineup hadn&#8217;t gone unnoticed, more cars appeared behind us. But our patience had worn completely thin. Well pulled out of the line and drove out to the road we came in on. When we looked back as we drove off, the lights in the McDonald&#8217;s were turned off. We were none too impressed with the lack of service.<br />
Gallup had few roads that led to interchanges with the I-40. As a result, we ended up having to drive quite a distance before finding the next interchange. But the drive wasn&#8217;t without fortune, as we found a 24 hour restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump from the Interstate. Hunger now getting the best of us, we pulled in to obtain sustenance.<br />
The restaurant (the name of which escapes me &#8230; c&#8217;mon, it was nothing to celebrate &#8212; if it was, I&#8217;d let you know) was one of a small chain of eateries that ran through the south-west. The general premise was, as usual, &#8220;home-cooking&#8221;. That is the single most over-used and under-achieving terms I have ever heard. This particular restaurant was sparsely populated, and even then the waitress seated us away from everyone else. Somehow, someone was tracking us and warning others of our imminent arrival.<br />
The meals were nothing spectacular, we quickly figured out why the restaurant chain was only in three states. Dhar&#8217;s spicy chicken wasn&#8217;t, my roast beef drowned in the gravy, Rebecca&#8217;s dinner was nearly unspeakable, and Stefan&#8217;s hamburger wasn&#8217;t fit for a dog (or Stefan, for that matter). But hunger is a strange thing &#8212; you&#8217;ll eat nearly anything to calm that rumbling stomach.<br />
About half an hour to 40 minutes later, we boarded the Behemoth, and I took over driving for the rest of the night. The temperature in New Mexico was rather chilly, so we actually ended up using the car heater for a while until we were a bit warmer. Out we pulled and hit the road once again.<br />
The rest of the drive to Albuquerque was uneventful. Somewhere around 02:00, we pulled into New Mexico&#8217;s largest city and started searching for the KOA. Fortunately for us, the KOA Catalogue provided excellent maps for finding the often hard-to-find campgrounds. We pretty much had to drive to the opposite side of the city before getting off the I-40 to get onto Central Avenue.<br />
As was becoming a regular occurrence, Stefan had to do a late check-in. All of us were on the verge of dropping off to sleep (Rebecca had already passed out), and the sooner that we park and slept, the better. Stefan returned in a few minutes and directed us to a slot about 200 metres from the main office, conveniently located next to the washrooms.<br />
Dhar made an immediate run for the toilet, as we hadn&#8217;t stopped for an hour or so and his bladder was on the verge of springing a leak (pun intended). But as we quickly found out, the washrooms were closed for the season. This I found rather odd &#8212; what seasons are there in New Mexico other than summer and not-quite-as-warm-as-summer-but-better-than-winter? Nevertheless, Stefan and Dhar when hunting for the washrooms. Being too tired to care (or urinate, for that matter), I just pulled my bed out, drew most of the blinds, crawled into my sleeping bag and started to nod off.<br />
Stefan and Dhar returned a moment or two later, reporting that the only washroom they could find had a combination lock on it, prevent us from getting in that night. Dhar ended up relieving himself on the right front tire.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One thing about using an air conditioner &#8212; always use the air exchange feature. The air inside the van was beyond musty that morning. It smelled horrible. I woke blinking towards the navigator&#8217;s side of the van, expecting to see Dhar sleeping. He wasn&#8217;t there. I looked back to the rear bunk. Both Stefan and Rebecca continued to sleep soundly, but our mysterious friend had vanished.<br />
He was outside sitting on the picnic table, waiting for the rest of us to rise. I chatted with him briefly before heading into the shower, and it seemed that Dhar had been getting into trouble. Dhar seemed to be really good at this &#8212; trouble always managed to find him no matter where he went. He also ran into a few of the night people &#8230; y&#8217;know, the kind that should be sent to pasture at the local funny farm? Dhar had not slept that night, and had walked along Boulder Highway for several hours. I was somewhat surprised that he hadn&#8217;t attempted to walk to The Strip.<br />
Next thing I knew, Stefan and Rebecca leapt from the Behemoth, ready to face the day. They had gone to sleep no earlier than 04:00, and had only four and a half or so hours of sleep. Nevertheless, carpe diem was the battle cry and I had to ride the tide of enthusiasm with my freshly-waxed surfboard of enthusiasm. The first order of business, a swim in the pool.<br />
Dhar, as usual, wasn&#8217;t up for a swim that early. (Actually, he was never up for a swim. I began to wonder if he even really took showers &#8212; maybe Dhar dissolved in water.) Rebecca, Stefan, and myself sauntered over to the pool and got ready to take a plunge. But the signs said that the pool wasn&#8217;t open until for another half an hour. This little detail didn&#8217;t block Stefan or Rebecca, they proudly swung the fence gate open and walked into the pool area.<br />
Now I had a small problem with this. When I was in elementary school, I got in trouble all the time. I wasn&#8217;t a bully, I just kept breaking rules all the time. Nothing serious, but the Principal got to know me fairly well after a couple years. Formative years are an important thing to a kid, and in time I learned when to follow the posted signs. I don&#8217;t always, but I did that morning. This compliance with societal (and KOA) rules brought the Wrath of Rebecca upon me again, chiding me to &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; and be more out-going. I decided to get wet in a shower instead.<br />
That morning I began to set a plan into motion. One thing Las Vegas had in abundance was hotels &#8230; and there were no two alike. Even before the trip had started, I had decided for myself that we had to spend at least one night in a Vegas hotel. The only problem: too many hotels, only one night. So while I was showering, I tried to think of the best place to stay. And came up blank. The best hotel I had ever stayed in before was the Contemporary Resort Hotel in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. That was 1980. 16 years later I was now in the adult&#8217;s Disney World, and in need of a hotel of equal splendour.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca returned from the pool not long after I finished bathing, and started for their daily romps through the shower. I proceeded to the AAA TourBook on Nevada and looked through the resort hotels that were around. Caesar&#8217;s Palace, the Luxor, the MGM Grand, the Mirage &#8230; all of them expensive. Enter second stage of my master plan &#8212; I would drive that morning and conspicuously drive into one of them and book a room before anyone knew what hit them. But to insure I wouldn&#8217;t be tied to the bumper and dragged home, I would also foot the bill. Hey, if you&#8217;ve got inheritance, might as well use it! (I think my grandmother would have approved &#8212; she traveled all the time until her eyesight grounded her.)<br />
But first to figure out where to go. I nonchalantly asked Stefan if there was any hotel in Vegas he wanted to stay at, which one would it be. The answer was immediate: Caesar&#8217;s Palace. But almost before I could away, out came the dreaded question I was afraid would come: &#8220;Why [do you ask]?&#8221;<br />
I don&#8217;t like lying outright. I&#8217;ll tell tall tales, I&#8217;ll stretch the truth. But this is the kind of question I don&#8217;t like answering dishonestly. So I leveled with him.<br />
&#8220;Let&#8217;s stay there for a night. It&#8217;s right on The Strip. It&#8217;s an experience we can&#8217;t miss!&#8221;<br />
Stefan was immediately excited about the prospect, but his financial side quickly took over. &#8220;I dunno &#8230; can we afford to?&#8221;<br />
To this I was quick to respond, &#8220;Can we afford not to?&#8221;<br />
(For those of you who don&#8217;t recognize this little two-sided banter, try to remember a VISA commercial where a couple pulls up to the gates of this enormous hotel, stare at it in awe, then the guy asks simply: &#8220;Can we afford to?&#8221; The girl naturally answers: &#8220;Can we afford not to?&#8221; They change their clothes and in they go. I had similar aspirations.)<br />
I had hoped that the conversation would end there, but they persisted on discussing the matter. This is the problem with personal agendas &#8230; no-one else ever knows what the hell you&#8217;re up to at any given moment. The expense of the room was a problem for them, particularly Stefan and Rebecca who were already up to their eyeballs in debts for school. I knew this, but I also knew of a way to correct this problem.<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221; I said smugly.<br />
&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Rebecca queried. I had a sneaky suspicion she knew what I was up to. Again, this is a question I don&#8217;t like avoiding.<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s on me.&#8221;<br />
Most of my friends would just look at me oddly and accept it. (Although that comes after a great deal of experience dealing with my odd behaviour.) Stefan and Rebecca know that from time to time I&#8217;ll pay for a dinner for my friends. I&#8217;m just that kind of person. I wanted to pay for the hotel room because I knew that neither Stefan or Rebecca could afford it, and I wanted to stay in a room for one night. Dhar, of course, knew nothing of my philanthropic tendencies.<br />
A debate ensued where I was supposed to cave in and let the others help out with the bill. (This is a typical response to such an action.) But if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from my father (and my grandmother), it&#8217;s stubbornness. I refused to budge. Even if I gave you a level long enough, you&#8217;d still have a tough time moving me. Dhar argued he was more stubborn and eventually would pay me for his share of a room. I looked and couldn&#8217;t help but laugh &#8212; I&#8217;ve heard that claim before, but never has it been substantiated by anyone.<br />
That argument aside, I proceeded to the KOA office to square away more postcards and stamps. I was surprised to find slot machines inside &#8230; I then kicked myself for forgetting what city I was in. In a gaming room just off the office floor, I also found an antique Pac-Man video game machine, circa early 1980&#8217;s. I hadn&#8217;t seen one of those machines in nearly a decade. Alas it wasn&#8217;t running, but its use was well documented by the phosphor burns in the screen. When Stefan came in a few minutes later, I made sure he saw it as well.<br />
We unhooked the van and drove it up to the KOA office so I could deposit my postcards. Dhar took the opportunity to empty the wastewater tanks so we didn&#8217;t have to haul sludge around with us. Then we started on the second order of the day: breakfast.<br />
For all the ridicule that it gets, the International House of Pancakes has got to be one of the few restaurants on my list that I would willingly go to at a moment&#8217;s notice. Especially first thing in the morning (which it was at the time). Fortunately for us, Dhar had found it a few hours earlier during his tour of Boulder Highway.<br />
Las Vegas has one major industry: service. If it weren&#8217;t for service, most of Vegas probably wouldn&#8217;t exist. As such, every place you go has people so nice, you&#8217;d think you were back home in Canada. Our hostess was a grandmother (or so she claimed), and seemed to only have the job to keep her busy. But she was one of those kinds of people who loved what she did. (And if she hated her job, she did an awfully good job of hiding it.)<br />
Huge breakfasts were the order &#8212; the table was full of plates, bowls, glasses, decanters, and jugs. Every last scrap of edible material was consumed by someone (usually Stefan), with our lovely hostess continually trying to get me to order a hot fudge sundae to finish it all off. Okay, I&#8217;m a chocoholic, I love sugary things, but even I have my limits to what I&#8217;ll eat for breakfast. (Stop laughing &#8230; I&#8217;m serious here! Really!)<br />
Paying for breakfast, we piled back into the Behemoth and tried to figure out how to get downtown. A quick perusal of the map indicated that Flamingo Road or Tropicana Avenue would provide an adequate route to Las Vegas Boulevard, more commonly known as &#8220;The Strip&#8221;. My carefully thought out plan wasn&#8217;t quite working &#8230; Stefan ended up driving. (My plans very seldom go as planned.)<br />
Vegas is an interesting place &#8212; the casinos seem to be confined to certain areas, all within a block of The Strip. (Mind you, those are big city blocks.) When we reached the corner of Flamingo Road and The Strip, we were surrounded by Bally&#8217;s on our left, the Barbary Coast Hotel on our right side, and Caesar&#8217;s Palace across the road from Barbary Coast. Stefan had seen all this before, but the collective jaws of Dhar, Rebecca and myself dropped at the sight. It was broad daylight so none of the lights were on, but we could easily see what was in store for us that evening. We couldn&#8217;t wait for the sun to set.<br />
We turned north on The Strip and quickly entered the left lane to turn into Caesar&#8217;s driveway. The hotel was the largest I had ever seen to that point. It sprawled about, almost a mile long when you included the mall tacked on to the north end of the casino. The grounds were a deep green (from the seemingly hourly watering) with impressive statues and small buildings. A huge textured dome revealed the presence of the Omnimax theatre that had been installed a few years previous. We had a desire to see whatever movie was playing, provided it wasn&#8217;t Wings of Courage. Val Kilmer is a great actor, but it was such a waste of movie for the technology.<br />
Following the signs, we turned left into an area meant for taxis and valet parking &#8230; neither of which fit our bill. But I was more intent on getting the room squared away as quickly as possible. I hopped out with Rebecca in tow while Stefan and Dhar attempted to make their way through the jam of cars to a safe place to wait for our return. And so I entered one of the most legendary hotel casinos in the world &#8230;<br />
Just inside the main door was a rotating four-sided sign advertising several of the hotel&#8217;s features among them the Omnimax movie &#8230; Wings of Courage. (So much for the movie.) When I turned to face into the hotel, I again felt culture shock. If Boulder Station had been impressive, the floor of Caesar&#8217;s Palace was beyond description. (And the sound was so deafening, that sexually-repressed prude would&#8217;ve had a heart attack and died.)<br />
It took us a moment to figure out where to go, but we quickly found the check-in desk, conveniently tucked away on one side. I jumped in line, about the 30th person, and waited patiently to check-in. Rebecca started back to the van to tell Dhar and Stefan we would be a while. Then I saw the sign that read: &#8220;Check-out 12:00&#8221;. It was noon. Check-in was at 15:00. I quickly grabbed Rebecca before she got too far.<br />
The next logical step: use a telephone. The phones weren&#8217;t too far away, and I couldn&#8217;t help but think of the circularity of having to call the hotel from a hotel phone to book a room at that hotel. The phones were standard pay-phones, but the handsets all had Caesar&#8217;s Palace logos engraved into them. A rather elegant, albeit tacky, touch.<br />
The Reservations desk couldn&#8217;t help &#8212; all the rooms were booked. Unfortunately, I saw this coming. The next step was to find an alternative. I started flipping through the book looking for something that would be just as fun. I ruled Luxor out because it was at the end of The Strip, and I really didn&#8217;t feel like walking all that distance. The Mirage and the MGM Grand looked interesting, but then Treasure Island popped out before my eyes. Rebecca had no qualms with the choice, so I dropped another coin and started dialing.<br />
If I thought calling Caesar&#8217;s Palace from one of their own phones was circular, the idea of calling one of their competition was absolutely ironic. But fortunate &#8230; Treasure Island wasn&#8217;t booked, despite a convention they were apparently hosting. I immediately made a reservation for a nice room that the four of us could share.<br />
This booking took a bit of thought. Originally Dhar and I had considered getting a room on our own so we could leave Rebecca and Stefan alone for an evening. But I knew I couldn&#8217;t afford two good rooms (there wasn&#8217;t such a thing as a mediocre room in these places), so I opted for something large enough that we wouldn&#8217;t feel crowded.<br />
Then I remembered Rebecca&#8217;s desire for a hot tub. I asked whether any of the rooms had such facilities. A suite called a &#8220;Pirate&#8217;s Cove&#8221; had Jacuzzis, which was close enough to our needs. The cost was substantially higher, but I felt that the price would be worth the experience. I read out my VISA information to the clerk to reserve the room (with little fear of being overheard &#8212; the phones were quite near the casino floor), and asked when we could take occupancy. It seemed that all hotels had a 15:00 check-in.<br />
Stefan had managed to find a place to pull in just down from the taxi and valet spaces. After a quick report of the driving skills of the valets, we started back towards The Strip. We wanted to see what it was all about, and since we had about three hours to kill, driving for a while seemed like a good idea.<br />
We passed by the Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Mirage, Harrah&#8217;s, Treasure Island, Sands (the last of the Vegas greats, which closed its doors only two months later), Desert Inn, Frontier, Riviera, and Circus Circus before The Strip more or less ended. Just a ways from the Frontier stood one of the newest additions to The Strip, the Stratosphere. Billed as the tallest free-standing tower in America, it looked suspiciously like the Seattle&#8217;s Space Needle. The last time Stefan had been in Las Vegas he had seen the construction sign for it, and he thought it the sign had said tallest in the world.<br />
Parts of the structure and its accompanying hotel and casino were still under construction when we stayed in Vegas, but it was very close to completion. So much so we wondered whether or not the hotel was open for business or not. As we passed by, Dhar noticed an odd red ring that seemed to circle the top of the observation level of the tower. Almost at once we realized what it was&#8230;<br />
Some idiot put a roller coaster at the top of Las Vegas. On the outside of the tower. It ran along the edge of the observation level in a nice circle, perhaps twice (at its height we couldn&#8217;t get a clear view). The idea was simultaneously unthinkable and exciting. I immediately wanted to know if it was ready for use. Although we never officially found out for certain, not once did we see a coaster train in operation. I had to wonder how many guarantees the local Government was given to allow such a thing to be built.<br />
(And on that note, I found out about a year later that the roller coaster is only half the fun up there. In addition to swinging out over Vegas streets 1000 feet below, there is also another ride which catapults you up another 200 feet or so into the air. I don&#8217;t know what raving lunatic came up with those ideas, but the mere thought of dangling 1,200 feet above the ground doesn&#8217;t exactly appeal to me.)<br />
Once the interesting part of Las Vegas Boulevard had ended, we entered into the seedier part of area, with motels bearing signs such as: &#8220;Elvis Slept Here&#8221; and &#8220;Recommended By Owner&#8221; (if those aren&#8217;t the best reviews you&#8217;ve ever heard &#8230; go somewhere else). One of the few establishments that was of any interest was the Graceland Chapel, one of the marriage institutions that will marry you to your loved one for a mere $25. An added bonus at the Graceland Chapel was to receive the service from an Elvis impersonator. But State law said that you had to be married first, and could only renew vows with said impersonator. Alas, no fun for poor little Geoff.<br />
We continued along Las Vegas Boulevard until we reached the Fremont Street area. Fremont is where one can find &#8220;Las Vegas Classic&#8221; &#8212; what&#8217;s left of the original casinos. A couple years ago the city council (mostly likely under some pressure from casinos and businesses on Fremont Street) turned a few blocks of Fremont Street into a pedestrian mall. To make the area more interesting, the road was also covered with a roof. But this was no ordinary roof.<br />
I had first heard about it on CNN, probably on the Science and Technology Week program. The roof extended over a two to three block distance. This in itself was nothing unusual, I&#8217;d heard of such structures in other places. But this is Las Vegas, not some boring metropolis. The underside of the roof was covered with six million coloured lights, in effect creating a gigantic video wall. Every hour the roof comes alive with a light show the likes of which I had never seen &#8230; and unfortunately still haven&#8217;t. From the Behemoth, I got my only good look at it. I had hoped to see it later that evening, in operation, but we never traveled further north than Treasure Island.<br />
We rounded the next corner and turned onto Main Street to head south. (In this area of Vegas there seemed to be several one-way roads.) Las Vegas Boulevard just a bit past Circus Circus became one-way northbound at the intersection of Main Street, Las Vegas Boulevard, and Paradise Road (Main Street became Paradise Road).<br />
On the way back, we decided to kill more time by finding out what Caesar&#8217;s Palace was like. Since we weren&#8217;t staying there, a browse through the establishment seemed like a good idea. We arrived at Caesar&#8217;s a few minutes later and entered the same driveway we entered about a half hour earlier. But this time we turned right at the fork in the road and went around the Omnimax dome towards the rear parking lot. Stefan grumbled about not being able to see a good Omnimax movie, I looked in surprise at the valet parking for the eager shoppers of the Forum Shops. (I mean, when is it too much? Valet parking to use the bathroom?)<br />
For such a large and popular enterprise, Caesar&#8217;s Palace had an awfully small parking lot. But fortunately not everyone drives, so we managed to find a parking spot without too much effort. We had to crack the roof vent, turn the fan on, and draw all the curtains to keep the van from getting too warm. Outside the temperature was probably in excess of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), but to be totally honest, we really didn&#8217;t notice.<br />
In southern Ontario we border on Lake Ontario. Its 19,011 square kilometres have this unusual effect of keeping temperatures within about two to three kilometres of the lake relatively smooth &#8212; no hideous spikes or dips. Unfortunately, its 19,011 square kilometres also provide a great deal of humidity. The &#8220;dog-days&#8221; of summer have particular meaning there, especially the days when the humidity hits 100% without the hope of rain. Even a normally comfortable 26 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) becomes unbearable.<br />
Nevada has the distinction of being the driest state in the Union. The humidity that day couldn&#8217;t have even come close to approaching double digits. It was nearly impossible to dampen a shirt from perspiration &#8212; it would evaporate almost immediately. In a way, that kind of climate is good to have from time to time, it&#8217;s a cleansing kind of climate, in a dry-cleaning sort of way.<br />
We entered the Forum Shops through the lower level, at the valet parking entrance. (The Forum had no rear access for some unknown reason.) The escalator deposited us at one end of the mall, looking into the casino. On our left was the Warner Brothers store, which we left for last. It was time to see how the rich shopped, and realize just how poor we were.<br />
The general premise behind Forum Shops at Caesar&#8217;s Palace seemed to get back all the money the gambler won at the casino. There was no such thing as a cheap or inexpensive item in the whole place. It was like an upscale Neiman-Marcus, a hip Sharper Image, a trendy Rodeo Drive (with a ceiling). And of course the whole motif was Classical Roman. After all, Caesar wouldn&#8217;t approve if it looked like any other mall.<br />
The design of the mall was reasonable simple &#8212; a single hallway that bent in two places. At each of the bends there were large fountains. The ceiling covering the hallway was painted to resemble the sky, and included variable lights that changed colour to show the changing hours of the day. The first fountain was immense, containing several sculptures of Roman gods and a Pegasus with wings spread.<br />
The second fountain was a little more interesting though. We arrived at the end of an hourly laser light show at the fountain. Everyone seemed enthralled with the presentation, but we saw too little of the show to really know what it was about. We made indefinite plans to see it an hour later, at 14:00. More on that later&#8230;<br />
Almost as soon as the crowd started dispersing from the show we narrowly missed, Dhar ducked into a sunglass store to purchase a hard case for his glasses. I contemplated buying a new pair of glasses to complement the ones I regularly wore (which were really ugly), but after a quick view of the selection, I decided against it. In hindsight, I wish I had bought new glasses since I could&#8217;ve used opinions from Rebecca, Dhar, and Stefan to help me make up my mind. Being fashionably challenged, I have always had a great deal of trouble in picking something that looked good on me. What I though looked good other would think was horrible.<br />
Another store that caught our fancy was a magic store, on the other side of the second fountain chamber on the same side as the sunglass store. I have always been interested in magic tricks, but mostly in figuring out how they&#8217;re done. The salesmen were truly gifted in their craft, perhaps retired magicians themselves &#8212; they demonstrated their wares with such skill and finesse that I was left completely stumped. Even something as simple as making a small ball magically pass through solid copper cups (a sleight-of-hand trick) had me dying to know how it was done. As much as I wanted to buy some of the tricks to learn them for myself, I decided that I&#8217;d just wait until I found someone who could teach me. Rebecca was tempted to get a trick for Eric to learn. I was tempted to tell her to learn how to make Eric disappear. (Not that I dislike the kid &#8212; Eric was the first kid I actually liked, probably because he reminds me of when I was a little kid.)<br />
Disney had a fair stake in their store, right up to the Roman style sculpture of Mickey Mouse over the store entrance. The floor of the entrance was also noteworthy &#8212; several hundred tiny lights were embedded in the plastic, wood, and concrete walkway, that glowed in patterns that cycled about every five minutes or so. The merchandise inside was nothing particularly special, I could find it at just about any franchise store. The main exception were the shirts made exclusively for the store in Forum Shops, bearing the names and logos of the Forum Shops and Caesar&#8217;s Palace.<br />
We popped in and out of stores on our way down the hall until we reached the end of the line: a set of stairs going down. These led into the &#8220;kids&#8221; area of the mall, consisting of a virtual reality theatre and a video arcade. We forwent with the virtual reality and concentrated on the video games. Like any well-managed arcade, all the recent and popular games were near the doorway, the rest were placed towards the rear in decreasing order of income.<br />
That was the first time I heard of (or took notice of) Namco, a seemingly major player in the billion dollar video game industry. Namco&#8217;s flagship game, at least at this arcade, was a first-person light gun shoot-&#8217;em-up. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t remember the name. (I found the game some months later, it&#8217;s called Time Crisis.) The graphics and the movement of the characters and the screen images was nothing short of awesome. Someone had taken a great deal of time to make the polygon rendering subsystem blindingly quick and smooth. I wanted to peel the cover off to see if there was a Silicon Graphics workstation embedded in the immense box.<br />
We stopped in a hologram store that had some laser art I had never seen before. (The general premise behind holograms is fairly elementary (at least when you compare it to quantum mechanics), a pure light source (i.e. a laser beam) is split and the two separate beams bounced of an object. The interference patterns of the two bounced beams (that is, the intersecting wave patterns) then hit a photographic plate where the interference patterns encode a three dimensional image.)<br />
But most holograms are static &#8212; that is to say when you move from side to side, or up an down, the object in the image appears stationary. Several of the holograms we saw used a totally new technique that allowed a mini-movie to be made: dancing ballerinas, moving animals, even a stripper (this was, after all, Las Vegas). I could tell that I was not alone in trying to understand how to make something like that, but I was getting about as far as Stefan and Dhar in deciphering the mystery.<br />
When we returned to the second fountain, almost an hour had passed. Still having about ten or so minutes before the next show, we ducked into a sports store in search of sandals. Dhar always wore his jeans (for some strange reason &#8212; even in New Orleans, where it was hot and humid, he couldn&#8217;t be convinced that shorts might be more apropos), but wanted his feet to be cool (his sneakers were obviously warm). At least he did recognize that sandals were more comfortable than shoes in the heat, and he wanted to buy a pair as soon as possible.<br />
The selection in the store was slim, and the prices fat. Stefan remarked that he could buy the same shoes in Canada for exactly the same price &#8212; not taking currency conversion into account. The Forum Shops were definitely not meant for the price-conscientious. In other words, Students need not apply.<br />
The dry air, combined with a fairly physical trip through the mall combined to make the lot of us very thirsty. Luckily for us there was a restaurant and deli right next to where we were standing. But getting into either meant a 15-20 minute wait. Thirst does not wait. We found a &#8220;drink bar&#8221; that extended from the deli. It was like every other store in the Forum Shops &#8212; expensive. A soft drink (i.e. Coca Cola) cost over $3.00, and had too much ice for my liking. But it was a fluid, and dehydration wasn&#8217;t big on my list of things to experience that day.<br />
No sooner than we purchased our drinks that the show began. (I said I&#8217;d get back to this.) Allow me to set the stage: the fountain sat in the middle of a large rotunda about 150 feet across and about 50 feet high. About 35-40 feet up the walls were all the effects devices: lasers, mirrors, projectors, smoke machines and so forth. On the opposite side of the rotunda was a small window for the show operator. In the fountain itself was the focal point of the show: the statutes.<br />
Statues you say? How can statues be a show? Riddle me this, fair reader: When is a statue not a statue? When it&#8217;s an expensive piece of animatronics. (Remember folks, we&#8217;re still in Las Vegas.) The centrepiece of the fountain was a set of four statues: a ring of three standing figures, two male and one female; a fourth and much larger (not only in size, but in girth) male figure sat in a large chair in the very centre, but raised above the other three statues. The outer three statues were to represent Venus, Mars and Mercury (unless I&#8217;ve gotten my gods confused). The centre statue was either Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry (and the patron saint of university students) or a rather fat Julius Caesar. I was never too sure which.<br />
At first glance the statues looked like ordinary marble. Until they started moving, that is. And I don&#8217;t mean just twirling around like a music box dancer &#8212; I mean moving. The centre statue would yawn and stretch, the feet would shift slightly, even the body would adjust its position in the chair. And of course, it would speak, jowls a-flapping. The mere production of the show lost all meaning for myself, and probably Stefan and Dhar as well &#8212; we were too keen on knowing how the contraption worked.<br />
This was not just some thrown together rubber, pneumatic, electronic piece of showmanship one would expect for Las Vegas. This was worthy of top-notch Hollywood effects. The movements were fluid and precise, appearing to be completely organic. (Take a look at how an assembly line robotic arm moves and compare that to how a human arm moves &#8212; they are very different motions.) Even the lip-syncing was well done &#8230; at least when I could hear the voices. (For all the money Caesar&#8217;s Palace pumped into the display, they could&#8217;ve at least put in a more effective sound system.)<br />
Although I didn&#8217;t catch all the words (I was more enthralled with the technical aspect of the show), the gist of it was essentially a grabber to get you to go into the casino. Okay, they didn&#8217;t directly mention the casino, but why else would you go to Caesar&#8217;s Palace in the first place? Yes, they could&#8217;ve put the gist of the show on a billboard, but then it just wouldn&#8217;t be as flashy. Las Vegas is a service-oriented city, and advertisement is the key to delivering that service.<br />
When the show ended, I took the opportunity to disappear for a few minutes into a memorabilia shop containing some of the most unusual things I had ever seen. Aside from the typical autographed movie posters and record albums, there were also hats, toy cars, antique gas pumps, an original plastic Ronald McDonald to place on park benches &#8230; so much stuff there was hardly any room to walk. I left after a short stay &#8212; I began to feel like the proverbial bull in a china shop.<br />
But nothing was as impressive as the gadget store. It almost resembled the commercial end of the fictional Q Branch of James Bond fame. I almost expected to see a grey Astin-Martin DB5 parked in the corner complete with the ejection seat. Actually, it would more likely have been the BMW from Goldeneye &#8212; the Astin-Martin would&#8217;ve been more appropriate in the memorabilia shop &#8230; if there was room to store it.<br />
Tools, clocks, digital barbeques, pool accessories, maps, lights, radios &#8230; you name it, they probably had it. One of the neatest pieces I saw was, of all things, a keychain. It was an ingenious device: a disc about an inch diametre and about a quarter inch thick. Around the side of the disc was a groove in which a half dozen individual rings could spin around the disc. A small button in the centre of the disc released a little catch opening a gap in the groove, allowing the rings to be removed. I can&#8217;t tell you how close I came to buying it, the number of times I&#8217;ve needed to remove a key from my keychain is unthinkable. However, the price they wanted for the simple device was equally unthinkable &#8230; $30.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan found their perfect product there too &#8230; a massage chair. Remember that episode of The Simpsons where Homer finds the ultimate in relaxation chairs, one that vibrates so much he begins to feel like Dave Bowman as he entered the monolith in 2001? Well, this one didn&#8217;t vibrate, but it had a very similar effect on Rebecca &#8212; she was flushed from only five minutes of use.<br />
We spent a disproportionate amount of time perusing the store, and after at least a half hour of window shopping, we mustered up enough will power to drag ourselves from the store (most of the energy was used in convincing Rebecca to get out of the chair). That chair cost $4,000. I was informed several times that if Stefan and Rebecca won enough money, we would be bringing it back with us. I wondered if we could con the border guards by getting them to sit in the chair and massage them into submission.<br />
The next stop was at Victoria&#8217;s Secret. The mail order catalogue of men&#8217;s fantasies had a retail store in the Forum Shops. Dhar and I elected to stay outside while Stefan and Rebecca went it. It&#8217;s not that I get embarrassed, it&#8217;s just that I didn&#8217;t even want to think about watching anyone trying on lingerie unless I knew that person really well and I was dating (or married to) said person. Going in there would have been like making a chocolate mousse cake, and then not eating any.<br />
Have I mentioned yet that Dhar was shutter-happy? I didn&#8217;t think so. (How&#8217;d I forget that?) He never stopped taking pictures. I think the only time he did was when he was changing rolls of film. Although I will admit that I did come close to using as many rolls of film as Dhar, I didn&#8217;t take as many people pictures as he did. Dhar would take pictures whenever he felt most like being a pain in the ass. I will admit that it bugged me, but in retrospect I relate to his habit. On previous excursions I had been known to be even worse, and I earned a reputation for being a total asshole for some of the pictures I took.<br />
Our last stop in the mall was in the Warner Brothers store. This was my doing. My friend Scott had several years before gone to a Warner Brothers store in Buffalo, New York and returned with an Animaniacs baseball cap. I will immediately admit I was jealous, the both of us were fans of the cartoon and of Amblin Entertainment, those responsible for the animated mayhem. I was hoping to find something in the store that interested me enough to get possible revenge (in a non-spiteful manner). Alas, the store simply wasn&#8217;t stocked with particularly unique items and those that did interest me carried a rather high sticker shock.<br />
By this time it was about 15:00 and we decided it was time to head over to Treasure Island and deposit most of our junk in a hotel room so we could explore more of The Strip. Down the escalator and out the valet entrance and back to the parking lot we went. On the way Dhar tried to use up the rest of his film by taking a picture of Rebecca in a &#8220;provocative and sexy&#8221; pose. For a woman who knows a great deal (and possibly too much) about sex, she can&#8217;t pose worth a damn. One reason why Rebecca isn&#8217;t a model&#8230;<br />
The drawn curtains and the ceiling fan did their jobs, the van was not uncomfortably warm. Stefan drove us back out under the Forum Shops, by the valet entrance and out to Las Vegas Boulevard, where we had entered over two hours earlier. We traveled north on Las Vegas Boulevard for approximately a kilometre and turned left onto Buccaneer Boulevard, which was actually Treasure Island&#8217;s driveway. Stefan pulled into the taxi and valet drop off area, Rebecca and I hopped out and went in to register.<br />
Again the sudden shift from medium noise to tremendous clamor was unsettling. But Treasure Island didn&#8217;t seem to be as loud as Caesar&#8217;s Palace &#8230; different slots perhaps, or I was getting used to the sound (stage two of Lasvegasitis was likely setting in). We found the registration desk and presented myself to a gentleman by the name of Leland, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. (The only reason I remembered the name was because it&#8217;s a rare one, I&#8217;ve only ever heard it once before &#8212; in the movie Toys.)<br />
I gave him my credit card, he double checked that I knew the hotel room was costing some $350.00 (American funds, but including taxes). Although I didn&#8217;t see Rebecca&#8217;s face when Leland read of the price, I swear I heard her gasp quietly. I cursed to myself, I had hoped no-one would find out how much one of these rooms cost per night. I signed a few forms, then Leland asked me for the names of the others. I assumed this was in case one of us lost our key, we could report to the registration desk and get a new one.<br />
The keys were of the newer swipe cards, much like a bank machine card or a credit card. The card is inserted into the lock, pulled out and providing you 1) haven&#8217;t somehow buggered up the magnetic strip, or 2) accidentally gone to the wrong room, the lock clicked open and you walked in. Leland let us know that the room was still being cleaned but that we could go up and drop our stuff off.<br />
Stefan and Dhar were waiting up the curb from the taxi stop. We climbed in and continued down the road to find the parking lots. Immediately we were confronted with a small problem: the Behemoth wouldn&#8217;t fit into the standard parking garages. One of the garages had a clearance of eight feet, four inches &#8212; one inch higher than us &#8212; but the lack of safe distance convinced us to find the oversized lot. This was so far back we could almost have as easily walked from the Forum Shops.<br />
We grabbed our bags, clothes, cameras, and some of the valuables (one can never be too careful about security), cracked the ceiling vent and turned on the fan, opened a couple windows (barely large enough to put a child&#8217;s arm through) and headed back to the main entrance. The intense heat of southern Nevada finally hit us, but only because we were carrying heavy loads.<br />
I honestly wish I could&#8217;ve seen some of the reactions of the casino patrons as we tramped into the hotel. Like most of the resorts, the casino was the centrepiece. To get to the hotel elevators you had to go through the casino floor; to get to the restaurants you had to go through the casino floor; to get to the shows or any of the stores you had to go through the casino floor. Although a large number of the people on the floor were tourists, and not dressed particularly nicely, we were outfitted with t-shirts, cut-off jeans, baseball caps, and large hiking backpacks. (And even if no-one noticed there, we definitely attracted attention when we checked into our hotel in New Orleans.)<br />
Fortunately, the casino wasn&#8217;t a terribly large one, and the slot machines took up the vast majority of the available space. Only about two hundred square metres was devoted to the other games (blackjack, craps, roulette, et cetera) &#8230; out of the approximately 30,000 square metres of casino floor space. For what it lacked in size it made up in business &#8212; it seemed to keep a regular flow of people in and out.<br />
Two sets of elevators ferried guests to their rooms. One set took you no higher than the 14th floor. The other set was for floors above 14. It took us a moment to realize this, even though we caught the right set of elevators on the first try.<br />
When we reached the 16th floor, we looked around for a sign that might indicate our room. Treasure Island was built in a &#8216;Y&#8217; shape, the &#8216;V&#8217; portion of the &#8216;Y&#8217; shape faced Las Vegas Boulevard, the tail stuck out back. A small dark brown sign with white lettering indicated four directions to travel in: right, centre, left and Suite 1620. It&#8217;s amazing how important you suddenly feel when it&#8217;s necessary to list your room separately from the rest of the lesser rooms.<br />
The double doors were open, a cleaning cart indicated that the room was still being cleaned. I had hoped that when I had made the reservation the staff might move a tad quicker and make arrangements to have the room ready when we arrived. We knocked once and cautiously entered the room. I had to bite my tongue when I heard the Hispanic maid emerge from one of the bathrooms speaking broken English. I had always assumed that kind of character was strictly stereotypical for Hollywood, I never expected to actually see something like that.<br />
The maid asked me for my door key, which she indicated I should check in the door. The door lock is a simple device: a small brass box about 10 centimetres wide, 20 centimetres long and sticking about two to three centimetres out of the door. At the bottom of the box was a thin black slot into which the card is inserted. Above the slot is a red light and a green light. Assuming the card is valid, the green light winks on a second or two after inserting and removing the card from the slot.<br />
I have been in many hotel rooms in my life, varying from comfortable to roach infested. But never had I ever come close to having a hotel room like this. The double doors led to a short hallway about 10 metres in length and four metres wide. About two thirds of the way down the hallway were two sets of double doors, one on each side, both leading to washrooms. The hallway opened into a large room, about eight metres in width and 15 metres long. Across from the hallway was a window sans openings. I was disappointed that there was no balcony, but as Stefan pointed out that oversight probably saved a lot of would-be jumpers.<br />
The &#8220;His&#8221; washroom (on the left, looking into the suite from the main doors) was very spacious: roughly 25-30 metres square. At the back left corner was a toilet (and just in front of the toilet was a phone), and the back right corner sported a shower. In the centre was a very wide-countered sink and mirror. A closet could be found just left of the washroom door, complete with safe (to which we didn&#8217;t have the combination). The floors were tiled, as were the walls in the shower.<br />
The &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom (on the right, looking into the suite from the main doors) was a mirror image of the &#8220;His&#8221; washroom with two notable exceptions. First, the toilet was in the front left corner of the washroom. Secondly, there was a whirlpool bathtub in the back left corner. It was not hot tub, but it would fill our needs &#8230; rather, Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s needs.<br />
The main room was sparsely furnished. On the left side of the room (looking into the suite from the main doors) was a king size bed, two night tables with lamps, and a large chest at the foot of the bed. On the right side of the room was a chesterfield, a chair, a low coffee table, a cabinet and a TV. All the furniture was white in colour finished with gold-coloured trim. (The woodwork had gold paint; the chairs, chesterfield, and bed had thin gold-coloured rope with tassels.)<br />
We marveled at the room for a few minutes, then decided to figure out what it was we were going to do. One of the first things on the agenda were showers and baths, since we wanted to go out to dinner before engaging in anything else. But first, we watched a little TV (much to my chagrin &#8212; I had hoped to avoid TV for the entire trip). We found the second TV in the chest at the foot of the bed, pressing a button similar to a garage door opener caused the TV to rise majestically from the inside.<br />
We quickly found out where our gas woes had come from &#8212; gas prices across the United States had jumped between five and 10 cents a gallon in the past few days. Some places hadn&#8217;t been drastically affected, but parts of California were asking $2.20 a gallon. We were suddenly relieved that California had been cut from the travel plan some weeks earlier.<br />
A couple channels were dedicated to broadcasting Las Vegas-related programming. One channel in particular was from Treasure Island itself, and continually played a movie about a kid&#8217;s adventure at the resort. Gambling was restricted to those 18 years of age or older, so the movie had likely been produced to get the kids excited about other things to do. From a critical point of view, it was entirely commercial but with enough Hollywood flair to make it passable for its intended audiences, namely kids.<br />
Rebecca turned to the whirlpool a little while later. It was then she made a rather odd request of me. I was asked to take a picture of her, but only after she deemed it okay for me to go in. I continued to vegetate in front of the TV over by the chesterfield until I heard her melodious voice call from the &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom. I was joined by Stefan at this call.<br />
There was Rebecca, seated in the middle of a sea of foam, the rose tattoo on her left shoulder standing out on her milky-white skin, and a huge grin crossing her face. I guessed that Rebecca had never been in such a place before and wanted to show off the things she got to do during the trip. I pulled out the camera, made a couple of adjustments to the focus and exposure settings, and promptly screwed up the first picture by forgetting to turn the flash on. The second picture ended up much more flattering, but gained a strange bluish tint to which I have yet to find a cause. No sooner than I had returned to the chair I had been sitting in to put the camera back in its bag than Stefan disappeared into the &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom, locking the door behind him.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan didn&#8217;t spend too long alone, emerging only about 20 minutes later. Dhar disappeared into the &#8220;His&#8221; bathroom for his shower. The remaining three of us began to discuss the events of the evening. Dhar had decided not to see one of the famous Vegas shows that night, he was more intent on seeing The Strip. On a suggestion from Rebecca, the Cirque du Soleil show, Mystére, became our primary focus on the itinerary.<br />
When Rebecca began to make preparations for the tickets, I promptly announced I was taking my shower (Dhar having completed his), and marched into the &#8220;His&#8221; bathroom. I was ecstatic to find that the Mirage (builder, owner, and operator of Treasure Island) hadn&#8217;t skimped on much of anything, putting in some of the best showers I had ever used. The free toiletries were no hell, but they seldom are.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960425.175</strong><br />
<em>Day 5</em><br />
Vegas along &#8216;The Strip&#8217; is nothing short of breath-taking. [Mostly due to the automobile exhaust.] I knew that this was going to be a great experience, so I took the liberty of getting us a room downtown at Treasure Island. Expensive, but it&#8217;s the experience that counts.<br />
Caesar&#8217;s Palace is an adult&#8217;s playground, and I suspect that the rest of The Strip isn&#8217;t much different.<br />
It&#8217;s going to be a long night&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea was to have brought &#8220;good&#8221; clothes with us so that we could all go out to a good restaurant and eat a good meal. However, my interpretation of Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s idea of &#8220;good&#8221; clothes wasn&#8217;t quite correct. Taking an assumption that experienced campers would bring clothes that would be acceptable in most places as &#8220;nice&#8221;, I brought along clothes I could pack away that wouldn&#8217;t be damaged by creasing. Unfortunately, what they brought I considered to be in the &#8220;business casual&#8221; category. I suddenly felt very underdressed.<br />
Dhar was the most dapper of the three men, but he wasn&#8217;t going to join us for dinner. For some reason, he was more inclined to eat on his own and explore the city that is Las Vegas. Our reservations for Cirque du Soleil were for 19:30, with recommendations to arrive at 19:00 to make sure we could get in. This meant we had to go for dinner at 18:00 so we could get in on time. Dhar left for his evening romp just before we went downstairs.<br />
Of the half-dozen or so restaurants in Treasure Island, my attire excluded us from the two upscale establishments. We ended up at the third fanciest restaurant, just up the hall from the Cirque du Soleil&#8217;s theatre and across the hall from the shops. On arrival we found a fairly long line to wait through. It took about 15 minutes before we were seated at a table.<br />
The interior of the restaurant was made to look like an outdoors Caribbean plaza: the walls were made to look like plaster-covered brick, complete with cracks and missing pieces. Fake windows and the odd closed balcony added to the illusion. The tables and chairs were made from wrought iron, an interesting choice for furniture, but again fitting to the atmosphere.<br />
The menu was nothing elaborate, offering meals from a variety of tastes including Italian, seafood, Cajun, Mexican, and traditional American. All three of us decided upon pasta dishes: I had a hot Italian sausage penne, Stefan originally was going to have the same but switched to something else, and Rebecca had a seafood linguine &#8230; shrimp, I believe. We also had a nice red wine to go along with the meal.<br />
By the time we finished it was almost 19:00, and I was a slightly inebriated. I had drank a little more wine than Rebecca, and certainly much faster. Not to mention my alcoholic tolerance was significantly lower. Fortunately my meal allowed me to metabolize the wine fairly swiftly and within about a half hour I was sober.<br />
The tickets to the show were over $60 apiece. I was a little taken aback at the price, but our seats were third row centre. I remarked on Rebecca&#8217;s ability to get such good seats on such short notice. The tickets were expensive, but as I would soon find out, well worth the price. I wanted to pay Rebecca back for the cost of the ticket (she had purchased the tickets on her VISA card while I had been in the shower), but I was countered with a negative response &#8212; I pay for the room, they paid for the tickets. The wine, not yet worn off, prevented me from arguing the point any further.<br />
Based in Montreal, the Cirque du Soleil ( &#8220;Circus of the Sun&#8221;) company runs several troupes that tour the globe at any given time. The troupe at Treasure Island however, was as permanent as their facility. I had seen a Cirque du Soleil performance in Quebec City in 1986, and a spin-off company of former Cirque du Soleil members a couple years later &#8212; both were in large circus-style tents. Even a quick glance around the room told you that Cirque du Soleil had the facility built to their specifications.<br />
The seating was arranged in a nearly perfect semi-circle, divided into a lower section and an upper section. The lower section had about 15 rows of seats, the upper section about 20 to 30. All were cushioned folding seats with drink holders in the armrests. This was a far cry from the scaffolding benches I had sat on in performances of years past.<br />
The stage was an impressive sight. It was arranged in a kind of thrust stage arrangement more at home in proper stage drama theatres. The &#8220;thrust&#8221; portion of the stage started at the curve in the semi-circle of seats and extended back towards the main portion of the stage. The thrust portion was about 10 metres wide and 15 metres deep. The main portion of the state ran back a further 15 to 20 metres and was at least 50 to 60 metres wide (including the invisible wings). On either side of the stage were towers that ran from the walls to about a quarter of the distance into the stage area. A third of the way up the towers were places for the musicians.<br />
I thought it a bit strange to have live music at a performance such as this. The Cirque du Soleil wasn&#8217;t a true circus in the sense there were no animals &#8212; at least if you considered all the performers human. The performance was completely scripted and timed &#8212; specific events happened at specific times, and humans could be relied upon to stick to those cues. A simple pre-recorded sound track should suffice. As I would later learn, there was a reason for live music.<br />
A commotion and low murmuring behind us caused us to turn around &#8230; curiousity is a hard thing to ignore. A well-endowed woman in a white skin-tight dress (ending about six inches down her thighs) had entered the room. I immediately wondered how much she had paid to get her bosom to look the way it did. Then I noticed the reason for the murmuring: it wasn&#8217;t the woman, it was the clown following her, ogling her every move.<br />
I had forgotten about the clowns. Like the company they worked for, some of the clowns weren&#8217;t clowns in the true sense. This one looked like Albert Einstein on a bad hair day, wearing clothes more suited to an orchestra conductor but looking like he&#8217;d slept in them for a week. The only make-up he wore was rouge on his nose to make it look bright red. Like in performances past, he was the designated shit-disturber.<br />
He would walk to the entrance, and &#8220;help&#8221; people to their seats. This usually involved leading them to an entirely different place of the seating area than the ticket indicated, and even onto the stage. If the patron happened to be carrying food (usually popcorn), he would take the bag and start eating, spilling, throwing, or giving it away. Eventually one of the people he led behind stage &#8220;threw&#8221; him out of the theatre. It wasn&#8217;t the last time we saw him during the performance.<br />
The show began with a sudden explosion. The thrust portion of the stage and part of the main stage were comprised of four hydraulic lifts that went down about five metres below the level of the stage. When we arrived, the hole left behind bubbled with smoke. When the show started, that smoke concealed the first chapter of the show.<br />
Kodo is a Japanese art, usually several men and women drumming rhythmically on tom-toms of various sizes and usually on at least one huge double-drum. Some of the cast of Cirque du Soleil learned Kodo &#8230; they learned it well. I had never actually seen it before, and I was immediately blown away by the sound they made.<br />
The sound seemed to come from all around, much like a good home entertainment system generates high quality surround sound. But I quickly realized that in addition to the dozen or so drummers on the lifting stage, there were also four drummers being lowered from the ceiling along the semi-circular path leading to the audience seating. I had to admit, that was the best entrance I had ever seen.<br />
Now I&#8217;m not going to tell you everything I saw, and there&#8217;s good reasons for this. First, I honestly don&#8217;t remember everything I saw or in what order I saw it. Secondly, this was the kind of show you really need to see for yourself. If you&#8217;re reading this some many years from now, long after Treasure Island has closed (or been destroyed), I realize that this simply will frustrate you, and I apologize. But I can no more describe the awesome skill of these performers any more than I can tell you exactly what the Grand Canyon looks like, or the boredom experienced crossing Kansas.<br />
One portion of the show in particular that stuck with me for its sheer beauty was the balancing act. This was two men, both totally hairless, wearing very small bikini briefs, and completely covered with white powder. One of them would take hold of the other, bending outwards. The other would bend in a different direction to counter the weight. One such impressive example was when they formed a straight line about eight feet long, only one of them with his feet on the ground.<br />
Their motions were totally fluid, the positions they held requiring the utmost strength, agility, and flexibility. The act was so beautifully done, I even had to nudge Rebecca and ask her if I was the only one who thought the scene was very sexual. I wasn&#8217;t alone, but I wasn&#8217;t as excited as Rebecca, who had to fan herself at the end of the sequence.<br />
The trapeze act supplied me with the reason for live music. The trapeze was a group of ten people suspended in a rectangular box about 15 metres in length. The box was divided into eighths, with the fourth and fifth sections forming a single block. Below the second and seventh eighths were swings. At each of the lines dividing the eighths were horizontal bars around which the performers would swing, catapulting themselves around the length of the box. The performers on the swings would periodically catch one of the other performers leaping from another part of the frame, or would fling a performer to the other side.<br />
At one point in the show, one of the performers was getting ready to execute what looked like a flip. He swung around the bar between the third and fourth sections, and built up a great deal of momentum. Whether he lost his grip or let go too early I couldn&#8217;t tell, but the next thing he knew, he shot right into the swing mounted below the second section. It was a fairly stiff impact, and it was obvious that he was hurt.<br />
If MystÃ¯ ¿ ½re had a linear sound track, played from a CD or a master tape, the cues would had to have been so precise that no errors could have ever been committed during any of the performances. When the trapeze accident occurred, there was a pause of about twenty to thirty seconds before anyone moved. But the band played on. Stefan and I debated whether or not the act was cut short as a result of the accident, but by the musical score being played, you really couldn&#8217;t tell.<br />
The show ended almost the same way it started, with Kodo. This time the music was much longer and had more bold patterning of the beats than at the beginning of the show. This was due in part to the addition of another performer who seemed to be well-gifted with Kodo. With a few final echoing beats, the show ended, the cast and musicians took their bows, and we headed towards the exits.<br />
On the way out, Rebecca and I stopped to purchase copies of MystÃ¯ ¿ ½re&#8217;s soundtrack from the Cirque du Soleil shop, next to the snack bar of the theatre. It wasn&#8217;t a cheap purchase, but when you&#8217;ve heard the music, you really don&#8217;t mind so much.<br />
After forcing our way through an ocean of slow-moving show-goers, we headed back to our hotel room if for nothing else than to drop off our purchases. I also wanted to grab my camera before continuing with our grand plan for the evening: to tour The Strip and see all that we could see. The idea was to keep wandering until we either got bored or became exhausted (though if you want my honest opinion, it&#8217;s pretty damn difficult to get bored in Vegas if you&#8217;re only there a couple of days.)<br />
Dhar was lying on the bed when we came in. If his hair had been any longer, it might have been standing on end, he looked that frayed. Apparently the three and a half hours he had been on his own had been quite interesting. First off, he didn&#8217;t have dinner alone. Finding his way to an unnamed restaurant in the area, he found himself accompanying some woman (with an undisclosed appearance) who had been stood up for a dinner date. Following Dhar&#8217;s insistence that nothing else transpired with this mysterious woman, he proceeded to wander up and down The Strip.<br />
And Dhar got into trouble. Again. Dhar was very good at this, he seldom needed to try. According to our illustrious travel partner, he was out taking pictures of some of the huge neon and incandescent signs that litter either side of The Strip, and walked into a vacant lot to get a clear shot of The Dunes (I think &#8230; I may remember the hotel&#8217;s name incorrectly). No sooner than Dhar took the picture that a car sped into the lot and a couple very large burly men charged at him. Dhar didn&#8217;t bother to hang around and find out what they wanted.<br />
The four members of our Mission Impossible Force reassembled, we engaged in yet another riveting debate as what to occupy ourselves with. Stefan decided to make use of the washroom and change into something a little more casual. Dhar continued to lie on the bed, doubly worn out from his escapades of the evening and his lack of sleep from the night before. Rebecca and I stared out the window overlooking Buccaneer Bay, a reoccurring recreation of a ship battle, performed every 90 minutes during the evenings.<br />
In the smaller of the two pools, on the left side (as a spectator would view it from the sidewalk) was the &#8220;pirate&#8221; ship. It was about 30 metres long, the deck about five metres above the water, masts extending 30 or so metres into the air. Over all it was a fairly impressive looking vessel. It was a shame that it would never float on its own. The water in the pool wasn&#8217;t very deep, and it was obvious that the ship was attached to the bottom of the pool &#8212; it didn&#8217;t bob in the water at all.<br />
At the very right side of the pool was a very narrow channel, running about 50 metres down the edge of the sidewalk to the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Spring Mountain Road. This was where the Britannia (the English ship) resided. It was equally impressive in design, but we didn&#8217;t get a good look at it until it rounded the corner and came into the pool during the show.<br />
By about 17:50, the crowd had formed firmly, and it was becoming very hard to move around. I couldn&#8217;t help think that this gathering constituted a safety risk of some kind &#8212; getting emergency health services through the throng would be a near impossibility. And there was no sign of either Dhar or Stefan. We were wondering if we could hold places for them any longer.<br />
Then Rebecca caught sight of her mate through the herd. It never ceases to amaze me how women (particularly those with significant others) can do that. It took me a great deal of concentration and a few moving people before I figured out where they were. Rebecca started shouting to Stefan, trying to attract his attention. For some reason, Stefan never once looked in our direction, nor did Dhar. Not wanting to have to hunt over hell and half-of-creation to find them after the show, I decided to risk minor embarrassment and attract their attention by the best way I knew how: volume.<br />
If there is but one gift I received from my father, it was being loud. I seem to have a naturally loud voice. It may not carry too far, but I frequently get asked to quiet down. (This was most noticeable when I was in elementary school.) I cupped my hands around my mouth, breathed deeply, and bellowed: &#8220;STEFAN!&#8221; For a brief moment, just about everyone on the sidewalk waiting for the show to start fell silent. Everyone wanted to know who the hell this Stefan character was. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel somewhat smug &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t attracted that much attention since I was in Grade 5. (My teacher humiliated me in front of my class when, in my boredom, I played &#8220;rocket ship&#8221; with my face.)<br />
Dhar didn&#8217;t stick around long though. We learned that Dhar hates crowds. And I don&#8217;t mean that he has a dislike for them &#8212; he really anathematizes them. His eyes looked wild, like he was having trouble breathing (he probably was). His voice wavered ever so slightly, like someone who could feel the walls closing in on him (he probably could). Before he got trapped in the living sardine can, he headed south (in the direction of the Mirage) to wait for the show to end.<br />
A loud fanfare about five minutes later announced the show&#8217;s start. The Britannia &#8220;sailed&#8221; down the channel and entered Buccaneer Bay, interrupting the pirate crew as they attempted to unload their stolen booty. A slight argument ensued where the captain of the Britannia attempted to order the pirates to surrender, to which the pirates politely refused by firing a cannon at the Britannia.<br />
At this point an all-out fire-fight began. Parts of either ship were blown up, apart, or off, and various part of the surrounding decor suffered slight to serious damage. (At one point, a tremendous butane-powered fireball erupts from one of the upper-level &#8220;buildings&#8221;.) The parts that fall apart were collapsible, and easily reassembled for the next showing.<br />
The sequence ends when the pirates, in a last-ditch attempt to save their scurvy hides, blow a &#8220;hole&#8221; in the side of the Britannia, which starts listing to port and sinks into Buccaneer Bay. The engineering that went into the Britannia was impressive: not only did the gantry on which the ship &#8220;sails&#8221; into the bay have to contend with corners, but it had to tilt the huge vessel into the bay, then raise it back up (undoubtedly full of water).<br />
The show ended with the Vegas clichÃ¯ ¿ ½: you&#8217;ve seen our show, now come in and lose your money. Okay, it&#8217;s not that blatant, but the principle is the same. Not surprisingly though, few took up the offer and went in (unless they were staying there). Most decided to go in the same direction we wanted to go &#8212; south, towards Dhar. The sheer number of people made it difficult to move, and even more difficult to find Dhar.<br />
We passed by the Imperial Palace, the Flamingo Hilton, and the Barbary Coast resorts before arriving at Flamingo Road. Along the way, Dhar and I took several pictures of the various resorts on both sides of The Strip, including the Mirage hotel and Caesar&#8217;s Palace. Dhar had already taken several pictures of The Strip (he claimed to have walked up and down it three times before going out with us), but that didn&#8217;t stop him from taking some additional, albeit strange, pictures. (One was taken outside Imperial Palace, looking right up the side of what appeared to be a paddlewheel &#8212; the entire facade was like a Mississippi steamboat.)<br />
The seedy side of Las Vegas began to show through. During the day the strong cleansing rays of the sun drive the scum and cockroaches into the shadows, you hardly ever see them. But at night the roads are lined with the dregs of society: drunkards (though many could have been tourists &#8212; only in Vegas do the drunkards dress well), beggars (many appeared to be ex-tourists who lost their proverbial shirts at the gambling table, most looking for &#8220;bus fare&#8221;), hookers, and if you looked carefully, the dealers.<br />
But by far the most noticeable and despicable mendicants were the magazine distributors. Remember the prostitute magazine that Stefan had been looking for the night before? You didn&#8217;t need to look on Las Vegas Boulevard &#8212; the distributors found you. And they didn&#8217;t care in the least who they gave them out to. Men, women, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they even gave them to children. You didn&#8217;t even have to chance a glance at one of them to have a magazine thrust against you.<br />
I really didn&#8217;t know which was sadder: the prostitutes advertising in the magazine, or the people giving them out. One would expect men, and some pretty sleazy ones at that. We were not disappointed in that regard. I was surprised, and somewhat shocked, to see several women dealing the adverts. It takes a lot to shock me, and that wasn&#8217;t something I was expecting. But it wasn&#8217;t the mere fact that women were doing this &#8212; it was the look on their faces as they did it. I couldn&#8217;t tell what the expression meant exactly, but the disgust of what they held, the despair of what they had to do, and sadness all seemed to exude through the leathery skin of their Latin-American faces. What they did was below begging, and they knew it.<br />
I personally have a thing against prostitution as well. I find it to be the most degrading thing a human can do &#8212; selling their bodies to survive, often in disregard of their well-being. Mind you, I frown upon pimps even more, they force others into harlotry so they can literally steal from those they &#8220;employ&#8221;. In Las Vegas, prostitution is legal &#8230; but no more moral or ethical than anywhere else. If the gambling alone doesn&#8217;t do it, the addition of prostitution certainly earns Vegas the name &#8220;Sin City&#8221;.<br />
We stopped for a while at Bally&#8217;s, pondering whether we wound venture inside and see what its casino was like. But we opted instead to stay outside and take a few pictures and look at the light sculptures Bally&#8217;s had installed. One such group was a series of tall semi-circular pillars that slowly changed colours. Against the background of gardens and fountains, they were beautiful to watch.<br />
We pressed onward along Las Vegas Boulevard heading south. Between Bally&#8217;s and the MGM Grand, there was only the Holiday Inn Boardwalk hotel on the opposite side of the street, which wasn&#8217;t much to look at. The MGM Grand on the other hand, was a very impressive sight. Currently the largest casino in Las Vegas (and possibly the world), the immense building glowed with a light green that was so appealing, we actually stopped to stare at it for a while.<br />
At the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue we found the majestic MGM Grand entrance, the huge stylized MGM lion guarding the gates. It never crossed our minds to go inside, we were more intent on seeing more of The Strip at the time. From the intersection&#8217;s corner we could see the Tropicana (south of the MGM Grand, across Tropicana Avenue), and the Excalibur (south-west of the MGM Grand, on the diagonal corner). The Tropicana was nothing special in its appearance, but the Excalibur&#8217;s bold white and blue construction, bathed in a strong white light was something to behold.<br />
Built along Arthurian styles, the Excalibur featured a castle structure (which undoubtedly contained the casino), and two long hotel wings built on either side of the castle. The castle sported several towers and spires, all topped with bright blue caps which seemed to glow even at night. (They didn&#8217;t glow nearly as bright as the top of the Luxor, just south of Excalibur.)<br />
The intersection of Tropicana and The Strip had no crosswalks, even though there didn&#8217;t seem to be any reason for the oversight. However, in lieu of paint on the asphalt, someone built two pedestrian overpasses: one running over The Strip on the north side of Tropicana, and another over Tropicana on the west side of The Strip. This effectively linked Excalibur with MGM Grand.<br />
We hopped up the escalator to the first overpass and made our way to the north-west corner. And into our view came the next big thing to hit Las Vegas: New York, New York. A venture between the MGM Grand and another company, New York, New York would create a condensed skyline of the city for which it was named. Still under construction while we were there, even the darkened half-skeleton of the resort was impressive. A construction office on the ground level had a model of the soon-to-be casino, offering a free night&#8217;s stay at the hotel when it opened. Judging from what I saw, the next time I&#8217;m in Las Vegas, I want to stay at New York New York.<br />
We crossed the next overpass to Excalibur, and went inside. By now, my legs were hurting. We had not walked that far, but for some strange reason I was utterly exhausted. Stefan and Rebecca weren&#8217;t much better off, so at least I didn&#8217;t feel like a weakling. Dhar, on the other hand, had every right to be feeling a little tired.<br />
After traveling down the long walkway inside (Dhar rode the moving sidewalk instead), we entered into a true Vegas casino: tacky in every sense of the word. Gold trim, gaudy fixtures, ugly carpets &#8230; the whole eyesore shebang. Simply from its appearance, I judged it to be a leftover from the heady days of the &#8217;70&#8217;s, when tacky was the norm. Much to my surprise, I learned that Excalibur was opened in 1991.<br />
The slots called again, but not before Dhar purchased what he, Stefan, and Rebecca called a horrid drink. Served in a large tacky bluish glass (part of the reason, I think, that Dhar bought it in the first place), it was supposed to have Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, orange juice, and a couple other things thrown in for taste. Apparently it didn&#8217;t work too well as a whole.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we found the ultimate slots: if you won, you got to drive home a brand-new Dodge Viper. At a quarter a pull, it was the most expensive slots they played. But with little success. By this point, I had reached the end of the second stage of Lasvegasitis, and suddenly found myself in stage three: I wanted to try my luck at the slots.<br />
But I knew that my luck was horrible, it always was, and I chickened out of the dollar slot machine. Instead I plunked three nickels into a one-armed bandit and promptly lost. My grand total gambling losses to date amount to $2.15 ($2 Canadian, $0.15 American) &#8230; though I suspect I lost the $2 more to theft than to gambling, but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<br />
Finding our general luck to be rather dismal, we headed towards the south hotel wing and the exit. We wanted to go that way so we could get to the Luxor with a minimum amount of effort. All of us were feeling rather worn out, it was looking like we wouldn&#8217;t see anything else that night. I really wanted to see Fremont Street and the lighted ceiling, but I began to accept that it would have to wait until another trip.<br />
The walk to Luxor was a short one. The closer we got to the hotel the smaller it looked. Whenever I saw the Luxor on TV or in a magazine, I equated the black pyramid-shaped building to the Egyptian pyramids on the Giza plateau. Although I&#8217;d not been to Egypt, it was plain to see that Luxor was a much smaller scale development.<br />
The inside of Luxor was &#8230; unspectacular, I was not impressed at all. Although the architect had placed all the rooms on the outside of the hotel, running diagonal elevators along the edges to service the 20 or so levels, it just didn&#8217;t look awesome enough. The interior was large enough to hold 14 Boeing 747 airplanes. But even that fact didn&#8217;t look impressive. It might have been my lack of energy, something which would make even the MGM Grand start to look dull.<br />
We unfortunately missed out on a tour that the Luxor ran, which I completely forgot about while we were there. It was a three-part multimedia virtual-reality spectacular that got rave reviews for the level of technology it used. But in a way the loss wasn&#8217;t so bad &#8212; more too look forward to the next time &#8217;round the block.<br />
After only a few minutes we decided to head back to our hotel room. But we made it only as far as the front door before hailing a cab. The taxi driver was an interesting fellow, he gave us his personal view of Las Vegas which essentially amounted to our trip&#8217;s motto: Been there, done that &#8230; next!<br />
A few minutes later we were back at the hotel, and hungry. But the ice cream parlour that I had so wanted to visit closed at midnight, we were over an hour late to gorge ourselves on frozen delights. We turned instead to one of the lower-rung restaurants, just off of Treasure Island&#8217;s casino. Keno boards could be seen on every wall, updating their information about every half-hour or so.<br />
There seemed to be a certain curtness about the wait-staff, almost like they wanted to have us complain and get them fired &#8230; almost. My desire for ice cream vanished, and I instead ordered a hot meal and a cold beer. I followed Stefan&#8217;s suggestion and ordered a Heineken. Until that point, I hadn&#8217;t found any light-coloured beers that I liked. Most had this a aftertaste that bothered me. But when all was said and done, the Heineken wasn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
One of the bartenders stared regularly at Dhar. We wondered why: possibly Dhar&#8217;s blue bandanna, which he wore almost constantly after the Grand Canyon. In any case, Dhar was about ready to start causing trouble when our bill arrived. We paid and left before Dhar got us ejected from the hotel.<br />
Dhar and I slept on cots that night, and it felt good to sleep on an honest-to-God mattress with sheets around my legs. I didn&#8217;t need to worry about Dhar&#8217;s snoring that night, I think I actually fell asleep before he did.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Viva Las Vegas! More specifically, Cirque du Soleil. What an amazing show. We walked part of The Strip tonight, but we never made it to Fremont before we were worn out. Dhar went off on his own and sounded like he almost scored&#8230; Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day&#8230;</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Morning began almost the same as Colorado Springs: cool and bright. But our distance south had provided us with a few degrees more warmth, making the morning not quite as shocking as the day before. Something else was different &#8212; no humidity on the walls. Once again Dhar was the first to rise, followed by myself, Stefan, and eventually, Rebecca.<br />
I got my first good look at the camp that morning. It looked smaller than the one in Colorado Springs, but then again Cortez wasn&#8217;t exactly the place to travel (or at least so I thought when I first got up that morning). Under the navigator&#8217;s windshield wiper was a small piece of paper, left by the camp management. It was a reminder to check in at the office that morning. It was the first and last such reminder we saw staying at the KOAs.<br />
There&#8217;s something about waking up at Cortez that I never really could quite comprehend. Cortez is mostly a flat plain, wedged between a few mountain ranges quite some distance apart. A few mesas interrupt the vastness, but not so much that it&#8217;s disturbing. Morning there is extremely peaceful. There&#8217;s no highway, no clamouring industry, no planes. It&#8217;s quiet. It&#8217;s slow. It&#8217;s too bad we couldn&#8217;t have spent the day there relaxing. But we had things to do, places to see.<br />
Showers were the first order of the day. The stalls were much better than the ones in Colorado Springs, as we now had two taps to control the water&#8217;s temperature. I hastened back to the van to get dressed and prepare for the drive out to the Grand Canyon, as that was the primary goal of the day. Secondary to that was a stop at Four Corners.<br />
Stefan arrived a moment later, allowing Rebecca to go and have her shower. Stefan quickly gathered up his wallet-pouch and headed over to the office to clear up any issues with our late check-in. I sauntered into the office a few minutes later and looked over some of the things they had in the store. I purchased more postcards and stamps while Stefan got the bill straightened out.<br />
No sooner had I stepped up to pay for my purchases than Stefan announced we had a change in plans for the day. My immediate reaction was one of annoyance, since he had not discussed this change with anyone so far. He quickly clarified himself by asking if I&#8217;d ever heard of Mesa Verde, to which I responded I had. He then informed me that it was about 10 miles away from our camp. I suddenly realized two things: 1) Why there was a KOA in Cortez, and 2) We were going to be late getting to the Grand Canyon.<br />
We informed Rebecca and Dhar of the slight change in plans when we got back to the Behemoth. Fortunately, neither objected to the change, even though none of us really knew what we were getting ourselves in to. The van was disconnected from the water and electricity, the oil and fluids checked, and a couple water bottles filled. I then took my position behind the wheel and headed us back towards Highway 160. We turned right and headed east.<br />
The trip was fairly short, we could see the mesas just to the south-east. We passed a sign indicating a radio frequency we could listen to park information on. The quality of the broadcast was horrible, but thankfully short, taking only about seven minutes to tell us all that we needed to know. It wasn&#8217;t long after the sign that the part entrance appeared.<br />
The park entrance off Highway 160 was 26 miles from the Visitor&#8217;s Center, which was where we had to go before we could find out what it was that we had to see. For some reason, this was either the most direct (or the safest) route into the park. I found it hard to believe that it was shorter for us to drive to the park entrance from the KOA than to get into the park itself. After paying our five dollar (American) entrance fee, we entered the second harrowing drive in as many days.<br />
The park, like the structures it was designed to showcase and protect, was situated on the top of a huge mesa, over 750 feet above Highway 160. The road to get to that height had to bend around the edges of the mesa and slowly take us to the top. The views we saw were as beautiful as the ones we had seen the day before traveling through the mountain ranges. Only here we were treated to a completely different palette of colours: browns, reds, oranges, and greens. Off in the distance the Rockies were still visible, their white peaks reminding us of days past.<br />
The route was lined with steep cliffs on one side and steep hills on the other. Although the speed limit was significantly higher than at Cave of the Winds, I chose to drive cautiously and not look over the edge unless we were stopped. This didn&#8217;t stop the others from peering out, oohing and ahhing, and telling me not too look. What I did keep an eye out for were the foxes, deer, and wild turkeys that were supposed to live in the area. (Although I didn&#8217;t want to hit a fox or a deer, a wild turkey would have made a great change in our dinner menu.)<br />
About 45 minutes after entering the park, the Visitor&#8217;s Center came into view as we rounded a corner. It was an interesting structure: a two-storey circular building with a spiraling ramp around the outside. The building was on the left side of the road we were on, and the Visitor&#8217;s Center parking lot was on the right. The two were connected by a walkway underpass.<br />
Upon entering the parking lot we saw our first vehicle from Canada, a beat-up orange Ford camper from Alberta. I wanted to find the drivers and swap stories, but we had no such luck. We wandered under the road and up the ramp on the other side. The building had a balcony that overlooked an area exceeding 5,000 square miles on a hazy day. (On a clear day, it was said you could see all the way to Phoenix, Arizona &#8212; about 300 miles away.)<br />
But a clear day hadn&#8217;t been seen at the Visitor&#8217;s Center since the late 50&#8217;s. The sign told of a major problem that had befallen the area: air pollution. Although the nearest industrial centre was some 100 miles away, the problem had not gone unnoticed. Just southwest of the park I could see a long brown cloud. At first I had thought it might be a dust storm, the deserts and the wind in that region of the United States are known for dust storms. But after reading the sign, I knew that such a cloud could only be one thing: smog.<br />
I have lived in a city all my life, I have seen pollution in many forms. In a way, I have come accustomed and maybe even immune to seeing it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t like pollution &#8212; I&#8217;m all for different ways of getting rid of it safely. It&#8217;s just that if you stare at something long enough, you tend not to notice it as much. Toronto has a brownish haze to it for most of the summer months, and once in a while during the winter. Inside the city you&#8217;ll never notice a thing.<br />
Outside the city my perspectives change, and where there are lots of trees, I expect clean fresh air. Colorado Springs had such air. But Mesa Verde is surrounded by nothingness for hundreds of miles. And yet the air pollution was worse than in an industrial centre. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should weep for the environment, for our children, or for the Native Americans who had to live in that pollution. In a way the only winners are those who profit at the expense of everything and everyone else.<br />
Inside the doors was a combination park information desk, bookstore, and museum. Two park rangers presided over the desk, providing information on the park and the tours, and taking fees for the guided tours. The park had three main sites open at the time we were there including two cliff dwellings and a small restored village.<br />
Mesa Verde sound familiar yet? If the name doesn&#8217;t ring a bell, a picture of it would. Over two thousand years ago, a group of Indians called the Anasazi settled on Mesa Verde and began their culture here. Related to the Pueblo Indians, they brought the craft of building adobe huts for shelter with them. But out in the open, they found life very harsh. In an attempt to build villages that would withstand the often brutal environment, they built cities into the cliffs.<br />
If you&#8217;ve ever seen a picture of a city built into the side of a small mountain, then you&#8217;ve most likely seen Cliff Palace, which is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. Because of its size and history, it&#8217;s also the only cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde that you can&#8217;t visit without a Park Ranger. Thus there is a cost for the tour, not only in cash, but in time &#8212; in excess of two hours. Cost for us wasn&#8217;t an issue (usually), but time was. We opted to do a self-guided tour of smaller dwellings.<br />
After figuring out our plan of attack, we did a tour of the museum. Although small for a museum of Native Indians, the exhibits contained pottery, jewelry, clothes, and pictures of at least eight different tribes of Indians. Many of these things I had seen before in documentaries, National Geographic and other museums, so in truth, I wasn&#8217;t all that interested in them. I started to goad the others into hastier actions, since I wanted to get to the Grand Canyon before it got dark.<br />
We got back in the van and drove further down the road we had traveled on. About seven or so miles down the road we arrived a parking lot surrounded by a gift shop and toilets on one side, and another museum on the other. All around us beyond the buildings were small trees, no greater than three metres tall. Unlike the deciduous trees further north, these had their leaves.<br />
Mesa Verde must have received its name from these shrub-like trees. In English, Mesa Verde translates roughly to &#8220;green plateau&#8221;. Unlike the plains next to Highway 160, the ground on the mesa was completely covered in trees &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t see more than five metres into the forest.<br />
We hopped out and began to figure out how to get down to the dwellings. We walked to the end of the parking lot (about twenty metres) and crossed over to the other side of the road next to another museum. There we quickly found more paths that seemed to lead into a small valley just beyond the museum. The trees continually blocked our view until we found a jutting of sedimentary rock upon which no tree grew. Climbing out on top of it, we caught our first glimpse of the dwellings on the opposite side of the valley.<br />
As a kid, someone could have easily labeled me as a nerd (not to mention that someone still could) &#8212; I always read. The books I read were rarely fiction. I preferred the sort of books that explained the world around me. Not being religious, I received my explanations from scientific bases. National Geographic took me around the world, Time-Life taught me how the world was formed and why continents drift, and PBS showed me sights I never thought I&#8217;d see.<br />
When I went to the Soviet Union in 1989, I saw things I had only heard of before and saw on the odd documentary or in a rare issue of National Geographic. I knew then that experience was no replacement for a facsimile. A picture may tell a thousand words, but an experience shows you the world. As with my first look at the Rocky Mountains, my initial glimpse of the dwellings was both exciting and awe-inspiring. And I was hungry for more.<br />
The route to the dwellings took us down the one side of the valley (a drop of less than 150 feet), across the floor and slightly up the other side. Along the way were markers that indicated points of interest, listed on a small map Rebecca had picked up prior to us descending into the valley. The map showed different types of flora that grew in the valley, and places where the Anasazi had scraped out a living.<br />
One of these places was at the apex of the valley, where a small spring was located. The spring formed when rain water and melting snow leaked through the rock and pooled. It was dry when we arrived, and I wondered if it had been wet any time in the past decade.<br />
But it was the dwellings we had come to see. There was something almost magical about stepping near them, like the spirits of the past were watching us. They watched from the darkened windows, through deep doorways, and from the trees that grew behind us. Whether they were smiling upon us for remembering their history or passing a curse that would last for generations, we didn&#8217;t know.<br />
The cave the dwellings were built into was roughly 150 metres long, 20 metres deep and about 30 metres high. The roof of the cave sloped down from the full height of 30 metres down to less than 10 at the rear. Rather, the rear that we could see. The dwellings were roped off in several strategic places to keep visitors from crawling all over the site. In the past this had been allowed, but assumedly over time things got damaged.<br />
The dwellings were an impressive sight, if only from their history &#8212; the buildings were nearly 2,000 years old. According to the Park Ranger, the Anasazi abandoned the dwellings long before the Roman Empire crumbled. Yet here were structures as high as three stories, made of stone, mud, and cedar logs. The assemblage looked flimsy by appearance, but must have been very strong to have withstood the elements for so long with so little damage. The walls of the buildings ran from the cave floor to the cave ceiling, which must have provided a great deal of structural integrity. The cedar logs inside the towers must also have contributed to the longevity.<br />
Just outside the cave were large holes, about 6 metres across and a just under three metres deep. At first I had no idea what they were, until I noticed a ladder seemingly coming out of the ground. The holes were ceremonial chambers (the name of which completely escapes me) that were dug into the ground then covered over with logs and flagstones. Small holes just outside the hole&#8217;s walls allowed air to enter the chamber and fan fires that burned inside.<br />
For some reason, Stefan took objection to the Park Ranger&#8217;s explanation of the hole&#8217;s use as a ceremonial chamber. (I had not been aware that Queen&#8217;s Engineers were required to take anthropology courses. ) Stefan believed they were sweat houses, similar to the ones used by other tribes.<br />
After touring the site for about half an hour, I started to goad the others into moving again. I wanted to make sure we&#8217;d get to our destinations while we still had light. A group of Native American schoolchildren who appeared to have come to the Park to learn about their heritage passed us as we slowly began to work our way back up the side of the valley.<br />
The climb back up was much more difficult than it looked. I wasn&#8217;t sure my exhaustion was due to the altitude (hence, lack of oxygen) or my general physical shape (which I wasn&#8217;t in). Either way, I was fairly winded by the time we got back to the top. A woman in front of me didn&#8217;t even make it that far before she had to sit down to catch her breath.<br />
Despite my goading, Rebecca ducked into the museum. We naturally followed to see what was there. The museum showcased some aspects of life the Visitor&#8217;s Center didn&#8217;t touch upon. Methods of weaving, how the cliff dwellings came into being, and general ways of life. A slide show in an adjacent room provided a more in depth view of Anasazi life, but we never got a chance to see it. Instead we browsed the museum&#8217;s gift shop.<br />
Somewhere along the time we got briefly separated and we lost track of Rebecca. While Stefan and Dhar wandered up to the main gift shop, I waited in the van to make sure Rebecca wouldn&#8217;t walk by unnoticed. As it turned out, we men were blind and had missed Rebecca while she was in the museum. Soon we were all buckled in and heading back out towards Highway 160.</p>

<em>Day 4</em><br />
Mesa Verde &#8211; a mystery? Many will speculate, but the truth will never be known &#8211; long drive to get there though. Next step is the 4 Corners, then (with any luck) the Grand Canyon.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We all agreed that the excursion had been worth it. None of us had seen anything like it before and I shuddered to think that I might not see anything like it again. To think that a people that every text lists as &#8220;primitive&#8221; could build such an impressive and enduring city is to not acknowledge the genius that was at work, and also to not acknowledge how far we haven&#8217;t come in those 1,000 years since the village was abandoned.<br />
On the trip back, we were heading mostly downhill. The van handled moderately better than on the way up, but I was still a bit edgy. Somewhere on this trip down the van was named by a member of our group (though who it was I honestly don&#8217;t remember) &#8212; &#8220;The Behemoth&#8221;. The name seemed very appropriate: it handled like a dead mule, accelerated like a turtle on tranquilizers, and braked like a marble on a greased roadway down a hill. We could see over almost anything on the road except semi-trailers and cube vans. We could comfortably sleep four adults. This was no ordinary vehicle.<br />
Upon reaching Highway 160, I turned left and headed back towards Cortez, where we would briefly link up with Highway 666 before heading southwest towards the Four Corners. The sound of The Beach Boys echoed through the van as we whipped through the downtown core of Cortez, a distance of about four miles. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were cruising down Highway 666 towards Shiprock, New Mexico.<br />
Surprisingly enough, it took a while for someone else to notice what highway we were traveling on. It came as quite a surprise to the others that there was in fact a highway named &#8220;666&#8221;, especially when one considers that according to Christian doctrines, that&#8217;s the number of the Beast. But if there is a highway to hell, the Highway 666 is it. The south end of Colorado and well into New Mexico is barren &#8212; no trees, hardly any shrubs, no water, a few lonely mesas and hundreds of dry river beds.<br />
Shiprock wasn&#8217;t our destination however, and we left Highway 666 about seven miles from the Colorado / New Mexico border to continue along Highway 160. But not before we pulled over to take a picture documenting to the Doubting Thomases back home that the Americans did in fact worship the Devil in some parts of the country.<br />
By this time, we were well into Indian country. We entered the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation about 10 miles outside Cortez. When we entered Arizona we crossed into the Navajo Indian Reservation for some 200 miles of desolation, ending at the Kaibab National Forest.<br />
It was the desolation that I found most intriguing. The American government had taken all the Native Indians and had placed them in this area of the United States. According to Rebecca, there had been a study published by the Government about the area several decades ago which claimed that the area was unsuitable for farming, fishing, raising cattle, industry, commerce, and living in general. On the top of the report there was the ink of a rubber stamp: Suitable for Indians. The truly depressing part is that it wasn&#8217;t an American government &#8212; it was Canadian. I didn&#8217;t want to know what the American governments had done.<br />
We didn&#8217;t come into contact with any Native Indians until we reached the Four Corners. The Four Corners is the only geographic / political location in the United States where four states touch at a common point. I always imagined that the four corners were marked by white chalk stones on the top of a grassy hill, kind of like the one featured in Coca-Cola commercials I had seen. But we were in an area that had no trees, let alone grass, and the only hills were steep-faced mesas.<br />
Highway 160 briefly enters New Mexico before going into Arizona, it was from the New Mexico corner that we entered the site. Existing in designated Ute Indian territory, the Ute Indians managed the Four Corners allowing members of other tribes to enter and sell their wares to tourists. At first everyone was dismayed at the five dollar entry fee to look at some lines in the dirt. I was quick to point out however that Native Indians have always had a hard shake from the Government (United States or Canadian), never receiving true compensation for all that they have lost. As far as I was concerned, five dollars was a very reasonable price.<br />
Four Corners is, to put it politely, a very basic tourist trap. The actual location of the four state corners (which, in all honesty, ain&#8217;t much to look at) is ringed by about 30 wooden stalls where Native Indians sell &#8220;authentic&#8221; Indian crafts and food. Quite often, so I&#8217;ve found in the past, many of the crafts are made in Taiwan, and the food comes from local 7-11s (though if there was a local 7-11 at Four Corners, someone went to great lengths to camouflage it). I didn&#8217;t go up to the stalls to verify my suspicions, so you may assume that I am incorrect in my beliefs.<br />
The Four Corners is essentially a large light grey concrete square about six metres across, with two lines running diagonally forming an &#8216;X&#8217; in the middle. At the apex of the &#8216;X&#8217; is a large dark grey circle, about a metre in diametre. In each of the four triangles formed by the &#8216;X&#8217; is the appropriate state&#8217;s name and seal. Tubular railing mounted all over the concrete platform ruined the site for me, there was no way to take a picture without getting at least ten metres of the stuff in the frame.<br />
Rebecca took the opportunity to review the stalls, while Dhar and I remained in the centre of the roadway. Both of us felt guilty about walking by the stalls and not buying anything. I felt guilty in general about the treatment of Indians, both in the U.S. and in Canada. Alas, my personal beliefs are not shared by many. While I believe the Indians should be allowed to settle wherever they want, many people I&#8217;ve overheard in conversations go with more Darwinist tactics &#8212; we beat them, they deserve nothing. It&#8217;s that kind of attitude that causes strife in our world, and will eventually lead to the destruction of our civilization if left uncontrolled.<br />
It was almost 14:00 when we boarded the van once more, this time with Rebecca at the helm, for our long drive across the State of Arizona. It was over 200 miles to the Grand Canyon, and would take us just over three hours to get there. The worst part of the ordeal was that the temperature kept rising as we drove, and the air conditioner had been left off to conserve gasoline.<br />
The terrain, despite its given name of &#8220;Colorado Plateau&#8221;, was full of hills and valleys. The cruise control on the van continually shifted in and out of the overdrive to deal with the rises and falls. Several times we had to turn the cruise control off as we drove just keep the engine from sounding like it was going to burst from its housing. I shudder think what the engine would have sounded like with the air conditioning on.<br />
And I sometimes wished that the air conditioning was on. Less than a day before we were in the high teens for temperature, quite comfortable for those who had been in a long winter. But in Arizona those temperatures were easily doubled inside the van. Every window and vent that we could safely open blew and sucked warm air throughout the van. Rebecca took advantage of wearing her skirt by having the driver&#8217;s foot vent blow air right up her dress.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Arizona has one thing over Kansas &#8211; at least we can tell we&#8217;re actually getting somewhere. Kansas has one thing over Arizona &#8211; it&#8217;s much cooler. 80 degrees inside an enclosed space for four hours is going to hurt immensely. Rebecca got stuck with driving.We&#8217;re almost in the heart of the Navajo Indian Reservation. Have to feel sorry for them &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing here, not like there used to be when they lived in the Great Plains.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I do mean nothing. The majority of things we saw out there was sand and sun. The only place more desolate than that would be either the Sahara Desert, or Antarctica &#8212; they receive about the same amount of precipitation and have about equal ability to sustain life. That part of Arizona wasn&#8217;t too far behind.<br />
Only the movements of the mesa and rock formations told us that we were going anywhere. Kansas was too flat for any such markers. Once in a while we would spot a few Indians with their livestock, usually sheep or goats, grazing along the road on the wrong side of the fence.<br />
We passed one rather interesting anomaly along our route. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but it was certainly strange. We passed under what looked like a covered conveyor belt, running from a mesa about a kilometre or so from the highway. It continued across the highway to a large structure I could only define as a holding tank. Alongside the building was a single-track railroad, with electrical lines running along the route.<br />
Electric trains in North American are a rarity. Electric trains in the middle of Nowhere, Arizona are unheard of. Yet here was such a train. The tracks ran alongside the highway for about 50 miles or so before vanishing off into the distance. Not once did a train pass along the line, nor was there any signs indicating what it might be. Alas, it remains a mystery.<br />
Not quite as much a mystery was another of Stefan&#8217;s annoying habits, though probably only annoying to me. Stefan&#8217;s father, aside from being a brilliant engineer, was also an accomplished musician. I&#8217;ve found that children of musicians seem to have a keen ear for how things should sound. Almost every time we put on a new CD to listen to, Stefan would jump to the equalizer on the van&#8217;s stereo and fiddle with the controls. Several times I was tempted to slap his hands and tell him to keep the hell away from it. But I couldn&#8217;t entirely blame him &#8212; I&#8217;ve been known to do the same thing.<br />
This particular habit of Stefan&#8217;s was particularly common when he was navigator. One of the navigator&#8217;s duties, aside from figuring out where we were and which way we were supposed to travel, was put in new CDs every so often. And when Stefan was in charge of this, the equalizer controls were shifted. While this custom was annoying to me, I will grant that Stefan had a knack for making a mediocre CD playing on a portable CD player through a cassette deck adapter sound pretty damn good.<br />
Music was one of the few things that kept us sane as we crossed over large expanses of land. The north-east corner of Arizona was just such a case. We made few stops while passing through Navajo country, one of them was in at the Tuba City Booger Thing. Sorry, Burger King. (I&#8217;ve never been too fond of that particular fast-food franchise, the food never really sat well with me. The only Burger King in Oakville died in 1990 or 1991, and was replaced with a Tim Horton&#8217;s. A much better choice, if you ask me.)<br />
Everyone except me got something to eat. I wasn&#8217;t particularly hungry anyway, so I really didn&#8217;t care too much. Heat seldom makes me that hungry. Rebecca relinquished her driver&#8217;s position to Stefan. I took his place as navigator as we headed to the end of Highway 160 to pick up Highway 89. As Stefan drove, he continued to be amazed at how long we had been inside the Navajo Indian Reservation. I continued to be amazed at how dirty it was.<br />
So far, all of our tours on the highways of American, Interstate or otherwise, had been very pleasant. Everything had been clean. Now whether it was the fact that Highway 160 went through the middle of Navajo country and thus was excluded from Federal or State Transportation Departments I don&#8217;t know. But what I do know is that there was more garbage along the sides of those highways than my family generates in a year. It was disheartening to see such neglect, but I didn&#8217;t know who to blame: the governments, the Indians, or the motorists. Well, obviously the motorists&#8230;<br />
After leaving Highway 160 for Highway 89, we briefly headed south for 15 miles. We then resumed our westerly heading along Route 64, which took us into Kaibab National Forest, and eventually into the Grand Canyon National Park.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it was the lack of food, the dehydration, sleeplessness, or the heat, but I was getting irritable. Really irritable. The moment we saw a canyon, Stefan&#8217;s eyes started to frequently leave the road and look into parts of the Grand Canyon. To be blunt, this pissed me off. We came close to the edge of a canyon wall once or twice, but the fact that he didn&#8217;t watch the road while we were driving was getting on my nerves. Several times I came close to telling him to pull the van over so I could drive. But before I worked up enough gumption to become a complete asshole, we entered more trees and Stefan was forced to return to the major job of driving.<br />
After paying a $7 entrance fee (valid for seven days), we proceeded to the first stop within the Park, known as the Watchtower. We could see the tower when we pulled in, but we didn&#8217;t proceed to it just yet, as we had other things to do first. Among them was a trip to the toilet, a tour through the first of two gift shops, and a call home.<br />
The Grand Canyon hardly had any visible signs of native animals, the only animals we saw were ravens. These were huge birds, about the size of a small turkey. They hopped around the picnic areas like the seagulls and terns we&#8217;re accustomed to back home. Dhar and I were a little surprised at the enormity of the birds, seemingly almost mutant.<br />
One of the gift shops was near to where we parked, and was one of our stops. I just knew that a gift shop in America&#8217;s best known natural wonder was going to have some of the gaudiest souvenirs ever concocted by man. I was not disappointed. I won&#8217;t tell you all that I saw, but there were t-shirts, hats, posters, cacti, and bandannas. Any place selling bandannas should be avoided. That&#8217;s not to say that places selling wall clocks made from slices of tree trunks, or cow dung for that matter, are any better.<br />
Outside the store was a phone, which Stefan and Rebecca made use of to contact their kids back home. Eric was loving the vacation from his end of the phone, because it meant that he didn&#8217;t have to go to school. Staying with the grandparents meant that he was too far from school to be taken in every day. I felt sorry for Stefan&#8217;s parents (who were minding the kids), I knew from first-hand experience just how hard it was to keep Eric calm for a mere five minutes, let alone 12 days.<br />
It was just after 18:00 in the afternoon when I finally got my first look at the Grand Canyon. We walked down a path away from both the parking lot and the gift shop, heading approximately north. Even though we were still a hundred metres from the edge of the gorge, we could already see the splendour that attracted tourists from around the world. It was yet another visual feast for the senses.<br />
Having formed from hundreds of millions of years of sedimentary rock, then millions more years of erosion from wind and water, the Grand Canyon is named as well as the English language can suffice. There is no equal to the intricacies and the blatant beauty of the canyon, nor is there a succinct enough word or phrase that can accurately describe it. Although I don&#8217;t know what the phrasing would be, the Native Indians probably have a word or a name in their languages that describes the Grand Canyon much better.<br />
The ochre and pale orange rock glowed in the setting sun, the entire valley looked like a giant ember from a dying fire. You could follow hundreds of layers of rock to the bottom of the canyon, where the deep turbulent blue of the Colorado River cooled the intensity of the view. By the time we reached the Watchtower&#8217;s position, we could see for what seemed a hundred miles north and east. Trees blocked our view to the south, and heavy haze shielded our glance to the west. Yet even that haze cast a heavenly glow about the deep &#8216;V&#8217; in the Earth, as if carved by the hands of gods.<br />
We basked in the warmth of the view and struggled in the stiff wind that blew through the canyon, taking several pictures of a sight I&#8217;ll probably not see for some time, if ever again. But soon curiousity won over my Grand experience, and I decided that a review of the Watchtower was in order. This started with a quick look at a plaque placed just in front of it.<br />
Built in the early 1930&#8217;s, the Watchtower had been designed by early tour operators to provide an excellent view of the Grand Canyon. The Watchtower was built from rocks local to the area, and from nearby trees. The Watchtower was built in two parts: the base section and the tower itself. The construction of the base was similar in nature to the ceremonial pits we had seen at Mesa Verde earlier in the day &#8212; circular in formation, with long wood logs creating short arcs around the walls forming a partial dome upon which the roof was constructed.<br />
The room was almost perfectly circular, except for the side the tower was attached to. There the circle had a squarish protrusion. The base functioned almost entirely as a gift shop. The majority of the items in the store were much more appropriate for such a venue, not at all like the things at the gift shop at the parking lot. The squarish protrusion contained mostly t-shirts.<br />
The tower was accessed by a set of curving stairs from the base, guarded by a turnstile that cost a quarter to use. Unlike the phones in Colorado Springs, the turnstile took a Canadian quarter, which unfortunately was the only quarter I had at the time. (I swear it!)<br />
These stairs took you to the first level of the tower which contained a circular display case in the middle, and a Native Indian fresco on the wall opposite to the stairway leading to the base. Near the stairway was a door that led to an observation level on the base&#8217;s roof. The fresco was mostly red and brown with some white. Dhar and I took pictures of the fresco, but due to misreading my light levels, my picture of the fresco was far too dark.<br />
Another staircase led you up to the second level of the tower, which contained only a couple benches and some small windows. This level was essentially a ring around the inside of the tower, the centre looked down into the first level of the tower. Another set of stairs led to the third and last level of the tower.<br />
The windows on the third level were much more open to viewing than the ones on lower levels. Coin-operated telescopes allowed a more close-up view of parts of the canyon. Signs on the wall gave instructions to camera users on how to obtain zoom shots with the use of the canyons. Dhar fed a quarter into one of the telescopes and immediately decided that using the telescope as a zoom lens was not a good idea. I concluded the same after a quick peek.<br />
To this point in the trip, I had not succumbed to any tourist purchases except for the postcards. But one of the shirts on sale in the squarish protrusion in the base appealed to me. It was a dark olive colour with faint Navajo patterns. On the left breast was a small gold phoenix with the words &#8220;Grand Canyon&#8221; under the logo. I also took the opportunity to buy more film. I had meant to buy some earlier in the day, when we were at Mesa Verde, but the prices there had been completely outrageous. On future trips, I&#8217;m buying all my film in advance&#8230;<br />
I coaxed the others to proceed further down the road to another point about ten miles away so I could get a different view of the Canyon. Unfortunately, time wasn&#8217;t on our side and in a few minutes we would be without enough sunlight for my panoramic camera to work properly. Disposable cameras are fun and easy to use &#8230; but only when there&#8217;s bright sunlight around.<br />
Like the rest of Route 64, the road was usually bordered by trees on either side within the park, a calming kind of scenery. Yet the experience of driving down the side of a huge gash in the ground bordered by lush trees in the middle of a desert, listening to the Bee Gee&#8217;s &#8220;Stayin&#8217; Alive&#8221; was enough to strike a feeling of insanity in the sanest of people. Of course, I&#8217;m not about to vouch for the sanity of Dhar, Rebecca, or Stefan &#8212; I already know I was a lost cause.<br />
By the time we reached the next point, sunlight was questionable. Nevertheless I took the opportunity to try and take a couple pictures. I wandered around the guardrails (as many people frequently did) and went down about 80 feet into the canyon. From there I had an unobstructed view of the gorge&#8217;s walls. It was to be the last picture I would take, as the light levels quickly shrank away after that. Several people from Spain or Portugal (I couldn&#8217;t quite tell which) continued to take pictures of their group as I proceeded back up to the main tourist landing.<br />
There I found another sign, containing the history of a hotel that had once been in service in the park. On the opposite side was the history of a copper mine that had flourished for a brief period on the canyon floor. Both were built prior to the Depression, which quickly put an end to both ventures despite the popularity and profitability.<br />
The sun was disappearing fast, but our hunger was not. I hadn&#8217;t eaten since that morning (and even then I think all I ate was an orange), and Stefan&#8217;s lunch hadn&#8217;t kept him full for long. On a suggestion (from someone) we decided to stop at the Park&#8217;s picnic area and make our dinner. We had been keeping our chicken breasts thawed for just such an occasion. That night we would feast upon fajitas, vacation-style.<br />
We drove further west along the road until we reached the park headquarters where the campgrounds were located. Here Highway 180 started and joined with Route 64 (less formally known as the park road), beginning its trip south towards I-40, our eventual destination.<br />
We pulled into a spot and set about digging out the barbeque and propane tank. The signs indicated that we were only allowed to cook at the fireplaces provided. But the fireplaces required charcoal, which we didn&#8217;t have. I assumed the signs were to prevent campfires, but decided to avoid a nasty situation and placed the barbeque on top of the fireplace grill. It was a bit of an awkward fit, but it worked.<br />
About that point another van arrived in the parking lot. It was our mysterious friend from Alberta. I stood beside myself for a moment, wondering at the odds that we would see the same van twice in the same day, almost 300 miles from place to place. The temptation to wander over and meet our fellow countrymen was overwhelming. Hunger, however, won.<br />
By the time the green peppers halves and the chicken hit the grille, the sun had effectively set and darkness set in. The fact that we were eating in a forest didn&#8217;t help matters any &#8212; what little light that was left didn&#8217;t diffuse through the trees easily. Camp candles refused to stay lit for long in the night breeze no matter how much we tried to shield and re-light them.<br />
This caused a minor problem at the picnic table &#8212; we couldn&#8217;t see what we were eating. Before we had left home, my father had suggested that we take a flashlight. My mother had suggested that we take a huge camping light that used one of those heavy 12 volt batteries. I suggested the Snakelight instead. Black &amp; Decker can make a pretty good product, and the Snakelight is one of them. It&#8217;s not very powerful, you don&#8217;t have a bright narrow beam, but when wrapped around the trunk of a thin tree, it provides a dandy glow for having dinner. Black &amp; Decker should talk with MAG and create a hybrid Snakelight / MAG Light. Now there&#8217;s a product!<br />
The fajitas were just what I needed &#8212; I felt a whole lot better once I had finished. By the time I had eaten my last bite, the chicken was chilled and the peppers were polar &#8230; but tasty nonetheless. We then set about the quick task of cleaning up. Unlike several of our evening meals, we actually washed the dishes before leaving. (As the trip drew on, we got into the habit of leaving them out for longer periods of time. Hey &#8212; we were on vacation. Who wants to do housework on vacation?)<br />
Following a stop at the washrooms, we headed out to Highway 180 and began our hour long trip to the I-40. Dhar took control of the wheel, I resumed my position as navigator, Rebecca and Stefan took their place in bed.<br />
On exiting the Grand Canyon National Park, the theme for the trip was finally established through a collective effort: &#8220;Been there, done that &#8230; next!&#8221; This theme was appropriate for many reasons, though the primary one for us was in how the trip was being executed. We were going to some of the most spectacular sights in the Mid and Southwest, stopping briefly, taking in the view, and then heading to the next sight. After a while I started to feel like Chevy Chase in National Lampoon&#8217;s Vacation when he and the family stop briefly at the Grand Canyon on the way to Wally World.<br />
The trip down Highway 180 / Route 64 was uneventful. The view was darker than a black hole, broken only periodically by the piercing headlights of oncoming traffic. Once we exited Kaibab National Forest (which surrounded Grand Canyon National Park on the north and south sides of the Canyon), signs of civilization began to appear, including an IMAX theatre. When Highway 180 veered off to the southeast shortly after exiting the forest, we continued south on Route 64.<br />
Our gas supply was beginning to run low. The van had a tendency to go through the tank at an increasing rate from the time it was filled &#8212; the needle would drop very slowly at first, dropping quicker as the tank emptied. Typically when the tank reached a quarter full, we would start to look for a place to fill up.<br />
We reached Williams, Arizona about a half hour after leaving Highway 180. Gas prices had mysteriously risen to $1.35 a gallon. Until then, we had been paying $1.20 or less for gasoline, and were not exactly in the mood to be paying so much extra. Dhar and I made the decision to continue west along the I-40 to Ash Fork, where we hoped cheaper fuel could be found.<br />
But the gods weren&#8217;t with us that day. In fact, we had finally hit the first signs of bad timing of the entire trip. Unbeknownst to us, gas prices had started to climb dramatically in the United States. In Canada, fluctuations of as much as 10 cents were commonplace, and although a nuisance, were grudgingly accepted. A rise of a mere five cents in America is enough to get politicians voted out of office. Our poor timing was to land in the middle of these price hikes. The further west we traveled, the more expensive the gas became.<br />
We filled up at $1.37, and chose not to argue any further about the price. But even that would get us only as far as Kingman, Arizona before another fill-up would be needed. It was already 20:00, and we had five hours of driving to reach Las Vegas. A late entry to the KOA was going to be unavoidable.<br />
The speed limit across most of the I-40 was 75 miles per hour, a speed that none of us were too comfortable with the Behemoth. Unfortunately, the semi-trucks passing us at 85 miles per hour didn&#8217;t seem to mind so much. Such passings regularly spooked Dhar and I, keeping us awake for quite some time.<br />
Arizona is a sparsely populated state, as is Utah, New Mexico, and Nevada, Arizona&#8217;s neighbouring states. This sparse population leads to one beautiful thing about the night in that area of America &#8212; light pollution is not a concern. Several observatories are built in that area to take advantage of the lack of light. The lack of light also allows one to see lights from a great distance. Even at almost 200 miles distance, we could soon see the bright lights of Las Vegas as a faint glow in the sky. At first I thought it to be a nearby city, but we never passed the glow as we continued westward.<br />
Dhar tired quickly, driving for only an hour and a half before I took over. Rebecca took sole possession of the rear bunk as Stefan came up to join me, forcing Dhar to camp out in the lowered section of the floor (which was coincidentally just long enough for someone to lie down). There were a couple disadvantages to staying there while the Behemoth was in motion &#8212; the friction of the drive shaft caused the floor to become very warm, and the floor wasn&#8217;t sound proofed. Nor was it terribly comfortable.<br />
It was roughly 00:30 when we reached Kingman, the last major city in Arizona before hitting Nevada or California. Just outside of the city we filled up with increasingly expensive gas before making our punch into Nevada. Already the glow of Las Vegas was plain as the moon in a cloudless sky. There was a dusting of clouds that night though, which was the only way we could really see most of the lights. I have to wonder if any resident of Las Vegas has ever seen a starry sky.<br />
We left I-40 for Highway 93, which ran from Kingman directly to the Hoover Dam and Las Vegas. Highway 93 was barren &#8212; no trees and hardly anything to see within 100 metres of the road. But the further we drove up it, the more defined the lights in the sky became. In particular, the lights of the Luxor Grand Hotel and Casino. It was one of the new breed of resort hotels, designed to look like a gigantic pyramid. At the peak was a transparent cap, through which shone a 40 billion candlepower light. (Yes, you read correctly, 40 billion. With a &#8216;b&#8217;.)This light was so bright it could be seen from space on its own. In theory, you could cook a hot dog over it. And a bright spot in the massive glowing mass in the sky indicated where the Luxor lay.<br />
Stefan wanted to see those lights badly. I guess the desire was the result of being such an engineer. I was curious too, mind you &#8212; I had taken apart and assembled enough things in my day to be curious enough to wonder how most things worked. The lights themselves weren&#8217;t a mystery &#8212; how they got so bright was a different story.<br />
But first we had to cross the Hoover Dam. When it was built in the 1930&#8217;s, the dam provided the Arizona and Nevada Governments with something more than electricity &#8212; it provided a bridge across the gorges formed by the Colorado River. Highway 93 became the only road linking the two states, and was the only crossing for over 100 miles in any direction. Highway 93 carried a fair bit of traffic, even at 02:00.<br />
As we rode into the top of the valley, the lights that beamed from the dam announced its presence. At first I didn&#8217;t even recognize it &#8212; all the pictures and films I had seen before were taken during the day. In the valley, the only lights came from the dam itself. There were no spotlights, just a few bright lamps. The walls of the canyon were black, the reservoir was black, both were utterly featureless. As the road bent towards the eastern end of the dam, a small paved area formed to allow cars to stop. Stefan and I pulled out to take a look.<br />
I was mostly interested in a picture. I had wound in the film I had bought at the Grand Canyon, but had neglected to wind it properly. I didn&#8217;t notice this error until after the pictures were developed &#8212; about a quarter of the frame had light exposure damage. But the rest of the time lapse shot gave me a memory of the Hoover Dam at night. Stefan noted that there was a security car parked nearby, the guards watching our every move. For a brief moment I felt like a terrorist planning the ultimate Coup de Gras.<br />
Dhar awoke briefly as we started crossing the dam. He had no idea where we were until we told him that only 20 metres of concrete were preventing a lake from emptying itself and carrying us to certain death. Dhar urged me to drive a bit faster.<br />
Visibility around the site was minimal for that time of night. All we could see were a couple structures: the four intake towers in the reservoir, a parking garage on the Nevada side and a tourist centre across the road from the parking garage. We happily noticed one bonus of crossing the border &#8212; we had another hour to get to Las Vegas, we had entered the Pacific Time Zone, the fourth zone in as many days. It was just after 01:00 Nevada time, and we still had 30 miles to Las Vegas.<br />
The trip up the side of the canyon was slow, I was about as careful as when I had driven up to the Cave of the Winds. The primary difference here was that I couldn&#8217;t see must past the edge of the road. The greatest fear comes from not knowing &#8230; I didn&#8217;t know what (if anything) was down there, and I wasn&#8217;t too much in the mood to find out either.<br />
Soon we were back in a 65 mile an hour zone traveling along Highway 93 towards downtown Las Vegas. The glow in the sky was so large by this point that we couldn&#8217;t tell where it ended. The spotlights from the Luxor were prominent &#8212; the four closely grouped bright spots were impossible to miss. As we rounded large hills, we could barely see the faint beam of light from the Luxor as it rose into the night.<br />
Next thing I knew, we were blinded by a casino. Not just the sign of the casino, but the whole thing. I hadn&#8217;t seen that many lights before in my life in one place. I marveled at the sight. Stefan ho-hummed the casino, warning me that what I had just seen was nothing compared to what lay just beyond the hills surrounding the original &#8220;Sin City&#8221;.<br />
And he wasn&#8217;t kidding. About ten minutes later, we reached the crest of those hills. The bleak black landscape dropped away revealing a glowing, pulsating being of light. The city was alive with itself. It was like nothing I had ever seen before.<br />
In the summer of 1992 I was living in a house in Kanata, just outside of Ottawa. One of the occupants was a kindred student who had come from Acadia University in Nova Scotia to work for the summer. The largest city he had ever seen before was Halifax. With a population of only 115,000 people, Halifax is hardly the city that the Ottawa area creates. (The capital region has in excess of one million residents.) Driving eastward from Kanata along Highway 417 causes you to come over a rise, and at night the entire city and surrounding area glows with lights. My housemate thought the sight was impressive.<br />
Ottawa barely holds a smoldering wick compared to Las Vegas on a foggy night let alone the dry, clear evening we crossed the hills.<br />
Stefan and I immediately pulled the van over to the side of the highway and started rooting through the CD collection. I had planned in advance to bring some music that had the names of some of the places we would be visiting. Although I didn&#8217;t have the original Elvis version of the song, ZZ Top&#8217;s rendition of Viva Las Vegas, played at near-full volume, did as good a job. My skin tingled as we drove down the hill into the ocean of lights.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca had to arise to the occasion, they really didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The first order of business was finding out where the KOA was in relation to where we were. Stefan was desperate to take a quick tour of The Strip before turning in, and at first I honestly wanted to. But with every mile I kept driving, the more I wanted to stop and go to bed. Everyone else had slept, even if only a little. But I had been up for nearly 17 hours, most of that time on the road, and I was exhausted.<br />
I had to let Stefan down on that. I really didn&#8217;t want to, but I was just too damn tired to really care at that point. We found the exit at Boulder Highway, and started heading south. Almost immediately an enormous sign for the Boulder Station loomed around. It cast so much light I felt the highlights on the Behemoth weren&#8217;t doing much good. About a mile down the road, we found the KOA.<br />
We were justifiably surprised to find a guard booth about 20 metres from the road. Inside were two night guards watching TV and keeping an eye on the goings on about the campground. We pulled up and Stefan hopped out to get the arrangements of the night squared away. Although he actually got to talk with someone who seemed to know what was going on, it still took quite a while to fill out all the vital statistics (including the type of connection we wanted, the number of people in the van, the license plate, the colour, our average weight, height, sexual orientations, what mental state we were in, the amount of money we expected to lose at the casinos, and so forth).<br />
Of all the KOAs we saw, Las Vegas was the most impressive. A large amount of money had been spent to create a beautiful park-like interior with well-paved roads, washrooms every 100 metres on each of the roads, all the amenities that even the most cushy motorhome traveler could need. Palm trees lined the roads, brilliantly coloured fragrant flowers were strategically placed to add to the beauty.<br />
Our slot was right next to one of the washrooms, about 200 metres or so into the campground. Pulling in, I made quick work of hooking us up to the city utilities while the others made quick work of the toilets. It was already about 02:45 in the evening, but we weren&#8217;t anywhere near getting ready to go to bed. Unlike myself, the others were catching their second wind and wanted to see a casino as soon as possible. I contemplated not going and just going to sleep, but I remembered events that I had missed before on previous trips by going to bed &#8230; sleep be damned, I tagged along.<br />
Las Vegas at night was absolutely awesome, to quote Dhar&#8217;s description. It was comfortably warm, the exact temperature at night where if it were one degree warmer or cooler, it wouldn&#8217;t feel right. But here it was perfect. There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky &#8230; nor many stars for that matter &#8212; the city and casino lights were so bright that only the brightest shone through. The wind was but the slightest breeze, enough to remind me of some of my excursions to Florida in years past. Despite my exhaustion, it was too nice a night to sleep.<br />
We wandered back out to Boulder Highway, which wasn&#8217;t a highway at all, just a large four-lane road, and walked about a half-mile or so to the Boulder Station. Even from the KOA driveway the sign was clearly visible, scrolling texts and all. The lights from the sign were almost as bright as day, taking pictures of it was a dead-easy task.<br />
Rebecca turned towards the casino&#8217;s entrance wanting to see more. Remembering an episode of How&#8217;d They Do That? I suddenly realized that my camera could be a problem. Every casino in Las Vegas, or in the world for that matter, had security tighter than most top-secret government agencies. There was simply no way to cheat without the casino management from finding out. Every non-sanctioned device entering the casino could land you in some serious trouble. I saw no reason why my camera would be considered sanctioned.<br />
Apprehension aside, we went in. Immediately we were confronted with slot machines, which probably collectively outnumbered the population of Nevada by a two to one ratio. The tones, tunes, and tings of the machines immediately caused my auditory system to overload, there was simply too much information to process. The experience is like living in a room where the light is always a soft white, then after 20 years you go into a disco. No, even that doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. It&#8217;s more like taking a very prudish, sexually repressed person and dragging them into a live sex show and placing them in the front row seat.<br />
While my body tried to adjust to what I can only describe as culture shock, Dhar and Rebecca immediately sat down to try some video poker and slots. I had gone to Las Vegas with two ideas in mind: 1) Not to gamble at all, or 2) Spend $10 at the dollar slots and see what I could do. That night though, I wasn&#8217;t in any mental condition to do much else than observe the rest lose money.<br />
Correction: I expected them to lose money. It seems however that Dhar has a horseshoe wedged up his ass &#8212; I haven&#8217;t seen someone that lucky in a long time. He would walk up to nickel slot, pop in no more than two nickels, and win at least six more. By the time we left he had increased a single nickel he borrowed from Stefan into about two to three dollars&#8217; worth.<br />
Rebecca wasn&#8217;t quite so lucky. She won a couple times, but the evening overall wasn&#8217;t too successful and she lost money. Stefan took his chances only once or twice, while I stood and watched the casino floor.<br />
Never before had I seen such depravation. At somewhere around 03:00, there were still about a hundred or so people bent on winning money. As De Niro said in the movie Casino: &#8220;The longer you keep &#8217;em, the more they lose.&#8221; When you bet small, as we did, that statement wasn&#8217;t quite true. But the people who were there at 03:00 with their large plastic cups of coins, the heavy smokers sitting around the card tables, and the anxious Keno players weren&#8217;t your average players, they were addicts.<br />
There was a strange film that seemed to cover everything and everyone in that casino. All the employees seemed to have this dazed look about them, the patrons were blind, even the machines and tables looked slightly dingy. And the longer we stayed in there, the more I felt the same scum beginning to form on us.<br />
I thought that the feeling was just the casino, but I soon realized that it was the city. Lasvegasitis &#8230; gamblemania &#8230; autogreedatory response &#8230; call it what you will, the disease is unmistakable and it afflicts everyone in time. The first symptom is a slight aversion to the atmosphere of Las Vegas. The second symptom is the most dangerous: acceptance. The third is a desire to gamble, and is the most subtle of the symptoms. Without treatment, this often leads to the full-blown virus that causes you to lose sense of time, and your money.<br />
This was our first exposure, and we fortunately decided to cut it short before we got totally hooked. We continued to wander about the casino until we found a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts shop that was still open. I guess the die-hard gambler needs a caffeine and sugar fix every so often. The others stocked up on coffee and sweets while I watched. My body was sending me signals ordering me to bed. Eating a donut at the time would&#8217;ve caused a revolt that I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for at the time.<br />
Finishing the repast, we headed for the casino door and emerged into the comforting night. We crossed the immense parking lot surrounding the establishment, watching the security vehicles do their rounds. Reaching a gas station, Stefan and Dhar starting looking for the &#8220;magazines&#8221;. There were none to be found that night.<br />
The last time Stefan had been to Las Vegas, he had seen a magazine that advertised all the prostitutes in the area. I&#8217;m an open-minded person, but when I heard about this I was a little shocked. I think that strip bars are degrading towards women, and you don&#8217;t want to know what I think of prostitution. The fact that Nevada had no laws against it was a curiousity to me, but the existence of such a magazine was nothing short of exploitation.<br />
Upon returning to the van, the Captain Morgan&#8217;s came out of hiding. The only mixed drink I have ever had was a pseudo-screwdriver make with Five-Alive instead of orange juice. At the time I was already rather inebriated and really didn&#8217;t care what I was drinking. Here I was just too damn tired to do anything, let alone drink. The last of the Coke disappeared that night.<br />
We sat out at the picnic table next to our van and began to talk about anything that came to mind. But no matter how hard I tried to concentrate, my mind kept wandering to thoughts of slumber. After ten minutes I gave up on the struggle and announced I was going to bed.<br />
Although the night was warm, sleeping in a sleeping bag would&#8217;ve been too warm. The 110 volt air conditioner received its first trial that evening. I barely managed to get a log entry in before falling asleep.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplementary</strong><br />
I have seen the face of depraved greed and despair. Thy name is Las Vegas. Inspiring as it was to arrive with ZZ Top blaring, nothing could prepare me for what I saw, or what I&#8217;ll soon see.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dawn arrives early at high altitudes, but we didn&#8217;t notice until around 09:00 that morning. Dawn also arrives very cold. When we went to bed, the temperature was something in the neighbourhood of 10 degrees Celsius. Not terribly warm, but when you&#8217;ve been having cold temperatures for six months, 10 degrees is not too bad. When we woke up the next morning, the temperature was somewhere close to zero.<br />
I woke after Dhar. I don&#8217;t know how long he had been up, but no sooner than I had opened my eyes that he was looking back. Both Stefan and Rebecca were asleep, showing no signs of immediate arousal. I raised the window curtain next to me and peered out into the early Colorado morning. The clouds that had shrouded Pikes Peak the previous day were gone, the sky was a perfection of blue. The sun cast long shadows but shone directly on the front of the van, lighting the interior.<br />
Immediately I noticed the cold. I hadn&#8217;t felt this since I had last gone camping. It was a damp cold too, mostly from the condensation inside the van. Most of the ceiling and windows were covered with large beads of water. I wondered if it was from humid air that we had somehow brought with us (not too likely considering how often the windows were open), or from our breathing. Either way, there was about a litre of moisture on the walls.<br />
A rustling of the sheets behind me and a few mumbled words indicated that at least one of our two remaining sleepers was beginning the agonizing stages of waking up. As it turned out we placed the two worst morning people together &#8212; a marriage of convenience, if you will. Both Stefan and Rebecca take forever to get up in the morning, though Rebecca is about a hundred times worse than her other half. The irony was Rebecca continually complained of Stefan&#8217;s lack of motion in the morning, yet he was always up before her.<br />
Dhar and I took this sign as an opportunity to draw all the curtains and go outside and see what morning in the Rockies felt like. I could hear mumbled protests from in and under sleeping bags and pillows about not only the noise, but the sudden increase in the light level.<br />
Colorado Springs is the only place I have ever been that had crisp air that wasn&#8217;t in the middle of winter. Normally, that crisp feeling only comes at some God-awful point in the winter when it&#8217;s so cold your nostril hairs freeze when you breathe through your nose. Except for the temperature and the frozen nostril hairs, Colorado Springs had that same feeling when you breathed.<br />
I smiled to myself, a remnant of a much earlier trip. When I had gone to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1989, Keith Black, the tour group leader, had continually said: &#8220;Smile, you&#8217;re in a different country.&#8221; (See [[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Introduction|My Trip to the Soviet Union]]) The United States is old news for a Canadian living so near to the border and has visited a few states. But nothing I had seen or experienced before prepared me for the sights of the Midwest. I smiled because for the first time, I really knew what Keith Black had meant.<br />
I had noticed Fountain Creek when we had arrived the night before, but hadn&#8217;t really bothered to take a look at it. The creek bed lay about 100 feet directly in front of the van, just to the east of where we were. The creek was low, and might even run dry during the summer months. The winter run-off had already come and gone, as the washed back grasses and debris testified to. The creek couldn&#8217;t have been more than a foot deep, but was probably only a couple degrees above freezing.<br />
Suddenly to my left, I saw something move. Looking over, I saw a medium-sized cat. At first I thought it was a wild cat, considering how it had lurched when I arrived. But when I got a good look at it, I realized that it had been a tourist&#8217;s cat that had gone feral.<br />
I was reminded of a book I had read, Tony Hillerman&#8217;s Skinwalkers. It&#8217;s a story of Navajo Tribal Policemen trying to solve a bizarre string of murders &#8230; a fairly typical plot idea. One of the main characters keeps a sort of watch over a feral cat that moves into a shelter near his trailer. Hillerman described the cat in a very specific way: under-nourished; looking like it had been well-bred; and very wild looking, like it was relying on its wits for survival.<br />
The cat before me was a domestic breed, but not a pure bred. It was definitely not a wild cat. Not yet. How long it had been in the wild I couldn&#8217;t tell &#8212; it was either a quick learner or a very good hunter. Either way, the cat seemed much better off than its literary cousin. It shared the same wild look in its eyes, which shone brighter than the sun. I know house cats, this cat was now closer to being a puma than a pussy.<br />
When I got back Stefan had finally pulled himself out of the bed, and was finding all the stuff he needed to have a shower. I decided to follow suit. I quickly realized however that my towel was still very damp from the night before (it really hadn&#8217;t dried during the night, which may also explain all the condensation on the walls and ceiling). Having a shower would obviously make me feel better, but I would have no way of drying myself off. Rebecca mumbled a nearly coherent idea about the hand dryers in the washrooms.<br />
I collected my toiletries and followed Dhar over to the washrooms. Alas, a hand dryer was nowhere to be found. I sighed and returned to the van, accidentally forgetting my shampoo on the counter. Stefan was entering the bathroom just as I left. When I got back, the doors were locked. My initial thought was that Stefan and Rebecca had locked themselves in. As it happened, Stefan had locked the door leaving Rebecca behind while he showered.<br />
Rebecca was still in bed when I knocked on a side window and announced that whatever it was that Stefan and Rebecca were doing would have to wait. When Rebecca opened the door, she gave me a bit of an odd look. I attributed it to her not quite hearing what I had said, and her general lack of alertness (Rebecca was not a morning person, especially without a large cup of coffee within arm&#8217;s reach). Rebecca promptly turned around, walked back to the rear of the van and buried herself in the sleeping bags, mumbling something about never waking up again.<br />
When Stefan returned, he looked much like a drowned rat who had tried to dry off by shaking the water from its fur. I don&#8217;t know how Stefan always managed to look like that, but I&#8217;ll give him one thing: he was consistent. He immediately apologized for forgetting that he had locked the van when he left. Rebecca grabbed her things and the infamous &#8220;purple bag&#8221; of toiletries from Stefan, and left to do her thing in the washroom. Dhar arrived a moment later and handed me a large beige bottle of Pantene shampoo. I mentally kicked myself in the rear for forgetting it.<br />
Having some of the Behemoth&#8217;s members back gave me the opportunity to give a quick call home. I hadn&#8217;t wanted to do so during the day, considering how much it would cost, but I knew full well that it would be rather difficult to coordinate my times with my parents. They didn&#8217;t like anyone calling after 22:00, so I chose the lesser of two evils and would call at 09:00 &#8230; 11:00 their time.<br />
I wandered over to the pay phone at the back of the KOA office, carrying my daily planner (which, as you&#8217;ll remember from two chapters ago, was doubling as our expenses log during the trip &#8230; not that this particular detail is of any use on this particular occasion) so I could jot down my medical insurance number in case my mother had managed to find it. Taking a suggestion from Stefan, I used the 1-800-Collect(r) service to get through to home. I found it not only a lot easier to use than the system I had used the day before (all I had to do was key in my home number), but also a lot faster to connect.<br />
This time my mother wasn&#8217;t panicky when she picked up the phone. This was probably because I told her I would call when I got to Colorado. It wasn&#8217;t entirely true, I had to call her sometime later, but I was keeping with my word. She hadn&#8217;t found my insurance number. This wasn&#8217;t surprising considering the condition of my room when I left (which, as my mother would often comment, befitting of the local waste disposal site). She asked me the typical questions: &#8220;How are you?&#8221;, &#8220;What are you eating?&#8221;, &#8220;Did you sleep well?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you wearing clean underwear?&#8221;<br />
I kept the conversation short for two reasons: 1) It was expensive calling long distance from the States during the day, even if 1-800-Collect(r) said you could save up to 40% on the call (shameless plug); and 2) My mother&#8217;s questions always annoyed the hell out of me. Hanging up, I walked around to the front of the office to buy postcards.<br />
KOAs make life very simple: everything you need is at arm&#8217;s reach &#8230; though not quite so literally. All of them carried postcards and stamps, although the staff wasn&#8217;t always on the ball with how much postage cost. Normally 40 cents (American), I was first quoted 20 cents in Colorado Springs, and 50 cents when we hit Albuquerque.<br />
The clerk at the desk was the same one we had dealt with the night before. I bid her a good morning as I set about the task of selecting appropriate postcards. At first I was going to buy five cards every place we stayed, one for my parents and one for my close friends at home: Scott, Tara, Chris and Kathryn. But as I quickly learned, many of the places we stayed (including the KOA) had the ol&#8217; four-for-a-buck deal. Now I don&#8217;t want to sound cheap, but saving money on postcards was a blessing, since I sent over $20 (American) of postcards and stamps home. Scott and Tara (who were seeing each other &#8230; and still are) were lumped together.<br />
I chose pictures of Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, miscellaneous mountains, and the tackiest postcard I could find. Scott had challenged me to send him all the tacky (or as he had said, &#8220;cheesy&#8221;) postcards to him that I could find. This proved to be a huge challenge, since for some reason good-looking postcards had become more popular than the bad ones.<br />
Having chosen my cards, I asked the clerk for postage. At the time I had no idea of how much postage to get. Unfortunately, neither did the clerk. But she said that 20 cents would get me just about anywhere, so I bought four 20 cents stamps. I filed the stamps and postcards in my organizer so I wouldn&#8217;t lose them and promptly started to head back to the van. Just as I was leaving, I thought to see if a postbox was nearby. The clerk indicated a small stand-up box just outside the door.<br />
Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar were sitting at the picnic table next to the van, poring over the maps we had, and arguing about where we would be going next. Stefan&#8217;s desire to stay in Colorado and travel about the different canyons and natural sights was being shot down by both Rebecca and Dhar. (No, Stefan hadn&#8217;t relented from the argument we all engaged in two days earlier.) I decided it wasn&#8217;t necessary for me to put a word in since my goals were being met through the dual attack. After only a minute or two, Stefan finally gave up and capitulated to figuring out where we were to go next.<br />
The TripTik provided by CAA was promptly pitched on a shelf &#8212; we were going to do the route the way we wanted to do it. Actually, the way they wanted to do it. I personally wanted to follow the TripTik because it would save us time in getting to our destination, which I assumed to be Las Vegas. I hadn&#8217;t yet shaken my habit of efficiency and punctuality.<br />
This was a problem for me, I loved efficiency. If there&#8217;s one thing I really couldn&#8217;t stand, it was wasting time driving the long way to a place. When I planned road trips, it was using a modified MST, a computer term for Minimum Spanning Tree. In plain English, this is the shortest combined distance (or measure) along a given series of points. In our case, the overall shortest distance meant we would first go to Las Vegas, then hit the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon. That was by my methods.<br />
I will be the first to point out that my methods aren&#8217;t always the best ones. And this was just such an example. The route according to the TripTik was to go south on Highway 115 to Highway 50, where we would travel almost due west until we reached Grand Junction, where we would pick up I-70. This would take us to I-15, which would take us directly to Las Vegas. But in doing so, we would have missed some of the most spectacular scenery I have ever seen. At some point in your life, you need to stop and smell the roses, or you miss living. The roses were especially sweet that day.<br />
So Stefan got at least part of his wish, which was to take a scenic route through the Rockies to Cortez, Colorado. There we would spend the night before heading to the Grand Canyon. But more on that when I get to it.<br />
Before we would leave, we decided that we should see something of Colorado Springs. The two principle things on our list were the Cave of the Winds and Pikes Peak. According to the AAA Colorado TourBook, Pikes Peak ran a Cog Railway to the top, but only in good weather. The Cave of the Winds was supposedly open all year long, but in any case I wanted to check. While the others continued to bicker over what roads we were going to take, I headed over to the phone.<br />
Interesting Fact: American phones don&#8217;t take Canadian quarters. Americans in general tend to dislike Canadian change. We found this out a few times when we accidentally (honestly!) mixed a couple Canadian pennies in with our American change. This (luckily) never happened to me, but Dhar and Rebecca both were scolded for &#8220;attempting to cheat&#8221; a retailer. I, purely out of curiousity, wanted to see if a Canadian quarter would work.<br />
According to the receptionist at Pikes Peak, the cog railway had not run the 09:00 run due to snow on the tracks. The receptionist didn&#8217;t know if the 13:00 train would run for the same reason, but suggested I call back at 12:00 to find out. This unfortunately ruled a trip to the top of Pikes Peak out because we simply didn&#8217;t have the time, at least in my humble opinion. Cave of the Winds was open, and all tours were running normally at regular intervals.<br />
I relayed this information to my comrades, who were still in disagreement about the routes. (For the record, this was the only time we had a real debate about which way we would go. For some reason, the rest of the United States was not a point of contention.) Stefan was dead set on the scenic route. I was more for the more direct approach, but agreed that the scenic route was a possibility provided we had the time to drive it. Then Dhar and Rebecca gave in and agreed to the deal. The majority won. I lost. Stefan smiled broadly &#8212; he finally got something to go his way for a change.<br />
We began the procedure of packing up. I went around to the driver&#8217;s side of the van to disconnect the hose and electrical cord. I quickly realized that someone had turned the water off in the night, assumedly to prevent hoses from bursting &#8212; a wise precaution. Following my father&#8217;s instructions, I blew any extra water out of the hoses, coiled the hose and connected the ends together to prevent any dirt or bugs from collecting inside. I also put away the propane tank, having found that it resealed itself during the night. At first I thought it might have been due to the cold, but I had let it sit in the sun for about an hour, and no further leakage appeared.<br />
Following another of my father&#8217;s instructions, I checked the van&#8217;s oil and engine coolant. My father is a stickler for things like that, particularly when cars are involved. My father does most of the maintenance on our vehicles, and in a way he expects me to be like him. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I work on computers, not cars. I actually prefer biking whenever possible.<br />
The van roared to life minutes later. My father drilled into our family to always let a car engine warm up before going anywhere, just to make sure there&#8217;s no strain on the engine&#8217;s parts. While the engine warmed, we filled several left over two litre plastic Coke bottles so we would have an ample water supply. Stefan warned us that we would dehydrate quickly at the altitudes we would be traveling at. I, for one, was not willing to take risks like that.<br />
I took first shift driving, and our first stop was the pump station. Although we never used our toilet, the washing of the dishes, my brushing my teeth, and the general use of the sink faucet had collected a lot of water in the gray water tank, which I wanted to dump before gallivanting around the Rockies. Rebecca and Stefan headed to the KOA office to get postcards and whatnot, Dhar stuck around to watch.<br />
Pumping stations are usually fairly simple things: a hole in the ground (into a holding tank) with a water hose to wash any spillage. The smell is absolutely atrocious. If you&#8217;ve ever used an outhouse, imagine a smell 100 times worse. I never want to know about the things that end up in a holding tank.<br />
Under the driver door is a running board step. This step is hinged and flips up to reveal the van&#8217;s propane tank with its valve, and the sewage hose with the tank valve handles. Unscrewing a small cap and pulling back a metal plate releases the hose from its tube, pulling out to a distance of about ten feet. But since I parked right next to the holding tank cover, I needed only a couple feet. I pulled back on the handles and dumped our dirty water.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were still milling around inside the office when we got there. Dhar and I went in to see what they were doing. I took the opportunity to purchase another four twenty cent stamps to correct the oversight on my postcards.<br />
I dropped the postcards in the drop box on our way out, boarded the van, and prepared to head back up I-25 to Cave of the Winds. The trip back was a little on the convoluted side, with all the off-ramps and road construction, but soon we found Highway 24 and started heading west. Unlike the day before, we didn&#8217;t cross over to Colorado Avenue, since we would have had to remerge onto Highway 24 further down.<br />
After a little while we found the exit for Cave of the Winds. It was in fact, a set of stoplights. We turned right and started heading up a road up the side of a mountain. A sign at the entrance told us to ask for assistance if we were driving a large vehicle. However the booths at the base of the mountain, where the help was supposed to be, were vacant. I sighed to myself, shifted into a lower gear, and prepared to see if I could keep ourselves from sliding off the road into a fiery death.<br />
The incline of the road varied but was at least a 6% grade, probably extending into the double digits in a few places. The road was narrow too, so I had to be extra specially careful when going around corners to make sure I didn&#8217;t fall off the edge. To top it all off, the road zig-zagged its way up the side of the mountain. It made Lombard Street in San Francisco look like a straight-away.<br />
The others oohed and aahed as I slowly guided our way up. I kept my eyes glued firmly to the road, not wanting to be distracted by a damn thing. Only once did I have to pass a car coming down, and for that I was thankful. I once caught a glimpse of the edge of the road, and frankly, it scared the hell out of me.<br />
When we reached the top, we drove around to a pull-through parking spot and climbed out. We weren&#8217;t too sure what we should wear inside, but I took the precaution and wore my shoes. Caves tend to keep a constant temperature, and it&#8217;s usually cooler than on the surface. Rebecca and Stefan wore sandals. Dhar would wear shoes until Las Vegas, and would hardly ever take off his jeans.<br />
The view from up there was amazing, but a neighbouring ridge blocked our view of Colorado Springs. I snapped off a few shots of the camera before we headed towards the Cave&#8217;s entrance. Along the way we found the grandstands used for the laser light show, something we were two weeks too early to see, and a miniature replica of an old-West saloon for kids to crawl through.<br />
The Cave entrance was a building built on the side of the mountain. On its main level was a lounge, containing flyers for other attractions, a love tester, and a black hole simulator for coins. Any good tourist trap needs to have a black hole simulator. Below the lounge was an arcade which according to Stefan had an old Zaxxon video game machine. Across from the building&#8217;s entrance was the gift shop, were we would get our tickets for the trip.<br />
We would be a part of tour 13. Lucky us. The shop was heavily unpopulated, containing a small handful of tourists, almost as many clerks, and a couple repairmen getting the store ready for tourist season. I guesses that tourist season had not opened yet. (Be vewy, vewy quiet. We&#8217;re hunting tourists. Hehehehehehe.)<br />
We opted for the Discovery Tour, a 40 minute quickie of the Caves. Also available was the Lantern Tour, which was slightly longer than our tour and performed completely with dimly lit lanterns; and the Wild Tour, a 6 hour trek through the mud and muck that makes up the harder to access parts of the cave. Ours was the cheapest, the quickest, and probably the cleanest (the brochures recommended that you wear coveralls and bring a change of clothes if you take the Wild Tour).<br />
We had to wait about 15 minutes before our tour left. This gave us time (perhaps too much) to wander about the store and see what there was. We found all sorts of tacky tourist souvenirs, including a series of cedar hand paddles with cute comments such as &#8220;Attitude Adjuster&#8221; and &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Little Helper&#8221;. I found an interesting law framed on one of the walls. Desecrating the cave (that is, breaking any of the natural formations or writing on the walls) resulted in a $500 fine and a potential 30 days in jail. I read the particulars, but nearly choked when I read that the law had been written in the mid-1800&#8217;s. That law was still in effect.<br />
Slightly below the legal notice was something I had considered a relic of times past: a sign indicating a fallout shelter. I had to point this out to (I believe it was) Stefan, remarking that the idea seemed a bit absurd. I was referring to the use of the sign at all, not the fact that the cave was a designated shelter. Stefan seemed to misinterpret my meaning, and replied that a cave would be an ideal shelter. This I never doubted, but the fact that the sign still existed was both curious and worrisome.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca both bought lollipops. Nothing in that action was overly interesting, only that the lollipops were all-natural and hand-made. Rebecca&#8217;s was a chocolate and peanut butter flavour, one that I must admit is unusual. Rebecca, originally enthralled with the idea, quickly found that the flavour was none too inviting.<br />
When the boarding call came we proceeded to a door on the north side of the gift shop, next to the frame that held the law. We handed over the little plastic tour tickets to the attendant then walked out to a small porch. There we waited until the tour guide appeared. He looked young, probably in his mid-20&#8217;s or so, and strongly built &#8212; this guide either worked out a lot, or did far too much spelunking for his own good.<br />
He gave us a quick run down of the rules, mostly involving desecration of the cave. A couple words about chewing gum, and then he noticed Dhar and Rebecca sucking on their lollipops. They too were a no-no (the lollipops, not my compatriots), and were quickly tucked away in bags wrapped in waxed paper.<br />
The entrance to the cave was through a short tunnel apparently dug out of the side of the mountain to allow for easier access to tourists. The original cave entrance, used by the two boys who discovered it, was further down the side of the mountain and much harder to use.<br />
The cave was not at all what I expected. Most of my knowledge of caves came from the pages of National Geographic, television documentaries, and whatever books I happened to read. (And people wonder when I describe myself as a nerd &#8230; go figure!) All of them depicted rock or dirt floors, lots of running water, stalactites and stalagmites, crystal formations, and little unnatural lighting. In other words, caves that had seen little of mankind. Cave of the Winds was a commercial cave, not run by the U.S. Park Service. It was &#8220;improved&#8221; to make it more accessible to tourists.<br />
The first stop was less than 20 feet into the cave, where the tour operators had a camera set up to take pictures of the tour members. Almost everyone on the tour were couples, except for a single elderly man (whose wife didn&#8217;t want to go into the cave), a couple with their toddler, and our group of four. In all there were about fifteen people in the tour group. The picture was nothing special, we were officially known as Group 13D, and would see our picture when we got out. This I found rather interesting since I knew that it would take nearly 30 minutes just to develop the film. The 8.5 x 11 pictures would take almost as long (under normal circumstances), and the tour was only about 45 minutes. (One of the advantages of having worked at a Black&#8217;s Camera shop is you pick up these things &#8212; the absolute fastest we could develop film was 45 minutes.)<br />
The first point of the actual tour was a large room about 100 feet long, about 40 wide and sloping from about 10 to 40 feet high. Here we were shown the original entrance, since barred over to prevent people getting stuck or lost. Also here was a time capsule, to be opened around the year 2080. The tour guide invited one and all to come back to witness its contents. We happily laughed at an otherwise lame joke.<br />
And so we walked down the concrete pathways with their aluminum, brass, and iron railings; up the concrete steps; marveled at the coloured lights that shone on the broken cave formations. I actually felt sorry for the cave, having to put up with humans continually wandering through, leaving behind their mark. I&#8217;m not a rabid environmentalist, but I&#8217;m not for destroying the world. As a camper, I strongly believe in leaving things as they were found, leaving nothing behind. I would have been much happier seeing the cave with lanterns, knowing how little of it had been changed.<br />
The Cave of the Winds holds the record for America&#8217;s highest commercial cave. I assumed that means that there are other caves higher than Cave of the Winds that are protected by the U.S. Park Service, but chose not to clarify the tour guide&#8217;s statements.<br />
Some parts of the cave were interesting. On one of the ceilings were a series of cave flowers, which are crystal formations that grow out like flowers. To prevent people from trying to pick them, the tour operators covered the flowers with wire mesh. Albeit ugly, the mesh kept the flowers for all to see, at least what was left of them. Many of the flowers were visibly broken or altogether missing.<br />
Fat Man&#8217;s Misery / Tall Man&#8217;s Agony was a rather interesting place to visit. It was so named due to its low ceiling (requiring tall people to almost have to walk through on all fours) and its narrow width. Only children could enter the passage without having to bend or crouch. I couldn&#8217;t help but call out &#8220;Everybody limbo!&#8221; like a boisterous Ricardo Montalban as I entered the passage.<br />
The Cave of the Winds, despite its name, was formed mostly through water pressure. Many caves (such as Mammoth Cave) are formed through water erosion, which although similar in nature, is still different. Natural erosion takes place over hundreds of thousands of years; water dripping and seeping through cracks eventually opens chambers. Under water pressure, the sheer force of water eroded the cave, most likely in a shorter span of time. When Cave of the Winds was formed, it was much closer to sea level than it is now. Many parts of the cave showed this erosion through pressure, the swirls and indentations of the currents were plain to see.<br />
We exited the cave nearly an hour after entering, leaving the cool 58 degrees Fahrenheit behind and returning to a much warmer 75 degrees. Upon exiting, our pictures were ready. The picture was nothing special, a simple 8.5 x 11 inch photo in a stiff paper frame. I was tempted to ask if we could buy the negative rather than the picture. That notwithstanding, Dhar bought the picture.<br />
We wandered about the gift shop for a few minutes while Dhar got his change from the store. Rebecca took the opportunity to buy some homemade fudge that the store sold. She was a bit confused about the flavour she was buying, since she had never heard of a Heath Bar. In Canada, we know the Heath Bar better as a Skor candy bar. I find the name &#8220;Heath&#8221; a rather interesting one for a candy bar, since the word &#8220;heath&#8221; means &#8220;wasteland&#8221;. (Part of the joys of being an English major.) Incidentally, the fudge was magnificent.<br />
The drive back down the mountain was not quite as nerve-wracking as the trip up, although I&#8217;m not too sure why. This time, I could see down the mountain, and it should have frightened me half to death. Maybe it was that I could see where I was going (the way up was mostly obscured by the cliffs). But the van remained in second gear the whole time to keep it from moving too fast, my foot firmly on the brake.<br />
The next issue was food. Not necessarily lunch, but food from which we could make meals. We opted not to return to Colorado Springs, but continue west on Highway 24 until we found a more appropriate place to buy our nourishment. When we reached Woodland Park about twenty minutes later, Dhar was too hungry to wait any longer.<br />
McDonald&#8217;s is not exactly known for their fine cuisine. In fact, a Big Mac is almost at the bottom of things I would eat when given a choice. But Dhar was in the mood for a McChicken &#8230; or a Filet O&#8217; Fish, one of those dumbly named sandwiches. I wasn&#8217;t too hungry and decided that a couple cheeseburgers would fill the void that was forming in my stomach.<br />
School was out for lunch. Everywhere I looked were high school students, and most of them looked rather undeveloped &#8212; I figured the hamburgers they were eating had higher IQs. As I looked around the establishment, I followed Stefan&#8217;s gaze to a family eating lunch. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so interesting as it was to realize that the family was wearing what appeared to be their Sunday best, and had dragged Grandma along for the ride. I shook my head silently, not understanding how someone could classify Raunchy Ron&#8217;s as good eating.<br />
Mind you, this particular McDonald&#8217;s seemed to be caught in a bit of a time warp (though none quite so severe as the Kansas Interspatial Distortion). On the wall next to the door next to the door we had entered through was a Mac Tonight sign. I suddenly had a flashback to the failed ad campaign McDonald&#8217;s launched in the mid-80&#8217;s to get people to eat at McDonald&#8217;s for dinner. The waning moon-head of the character was oddly disturbing, even more so when I was surrounded by people that some anthropologists might consider throwbacks to the Stone Age.<br />
We didn&#8217;t leave for quite some time, Dhar&#8217;s order took a while. Even when we did leave, we had to come back to retrieve the sandwiches he forgot. What a silly bunt! We continued along Highway 24, now looking for two things: a grocery store and a liquor store. (But you don&#8217;t even know her!) We didn&#8217;t even need to leave Woodland Park to fill that need. Stefan and I waited while Rebecca and Dhar shopped for sustenance. This gave me a chance to finish my lunch.<br />
I can eat a Canadian McDonald&#8217;s cheeseburger regardless of what its temperature is, or when it was made. The cheeseburgers I had just bought were freshly made (I had seen them made), but tasted horrible. American beef has a lot of fat and hormones in it, that is fact. Beyond that, I don&#8217;t know what else it could have been. The meat was like gray mush, there was only one lousy pickle, and the onions had no flavour. It was the worst hamburger &#8230; sorry, cheeseburger that I had ever eaten. It was the last American hamburger I ate during the entire trip.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what Dhar and Rebecca were doing, but they took nearly a half hour to buy a few bags of food. That included cans of corn and green beans, pancake mix, popcorn, tortillas, chicken, hot dog buns, green peppers, orange juice, and my personal favourite: fruit loops. Not the Kellogg version, but some knock-off that was cheaper, but just as high in sugar content.<br />
While Rebecca and I saw to the storing of the food, Dhar and Stefan saw to the purchasing of alcoholic substances: Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, and a large bottle of cheap wine. Neither exactly my flavour.<br />
Stefan guided me out of the parking spot (which had me on an angle pointing down a hill), and out into the driving lane. A few moments later and we were once again heading west on Highway 24. The day was bright, the air was warm, and we had almost seven hours and over 6,000 feet of elevation to traverse before arriving in Cortez later that night. By this time I had accepted the scenic route as the decided course, and on such a day it was not to be a course to be forgotten.<br />
The lack of clouds in the sky, the snowy caps of the mountains, the immense conifer forests became absolutely breathtaking. The roads wound in, around and through the hills and valleys that made up the Rocky mountains and the plains that exist between the ranges. Several times we stopped for pictures and to look at the beauty without the obstruction of the van. It wasn&#8217;t long before we left Highway 24 and started on Highway 50.<br />
Our highest point was Monarch Pass, which we arrived at about two hours after leaving Woodland Park. At 11,312 feet above sea level, both the Behemoth and I were having problems getting a good breath of oxygen. I felt a little light headed. We stopped as we crept up the pass, pulling over to the side for a while to have a brief snowball fight. The last time I had run around in the snow in my shorts had been about three years earlier when I was visiting a friend in Montreal. And this time I wasn&#8217;t even wearing my shoes &#8212; they were tucked away somewhere in the closet, I was wearing my sandals sans socks.<br />
Stefan took over driving from that point. I concentrated on seeing things I had never seen before. Rebecca and Dhar retreated to the back of the van to play cards, as they were very prone to doing. Stefan seemed to get really annoyed at this, he was very enthusiastic about all the nature we were seeing, and all Rebecca and Dhar could do was play cards. I stayed out of the argument, preferring to watch the world pass us by.<br />
Driving down the pass was almost as much fun as driving up. Stefan kept the van in second gear pretty much the whole way down, not wanting to burn out the brakes as we descended. Fortunately, the pass isn&#8217;t widely traveled and traffic was fairly low. The odd semi-trailer would drive it, and we usually passed them going in the opposite direction. Though just as we were exiting, we ran into one.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take Stefan long to get around it, the van having found new life at 9,000 feet, and we quickly found ourselves in the middle of cattle country. Everywhere we looked were cows, steers, and the odd bison. It seemed that it was breeding time too, as one bull on our right quickly told us. Outside of nature documentaries, I had never actually seen animals on the verge of mating. To be honest, I was envious &#8212; animals make it look so easy, they don&#8217;t have to deal with all the bullshit surrounding human relationships.<br />
One bull suddenly started gushing fluids from its groin, and it started to mount one of the cows. Rebecca sounded almost like a giddy schoolgirl witnessing sex for the first time. She shrieked about &#8220;how large it is&#8221;. I had to feel sorry for Stefan, that somewhere he felt he was being compared to an animal whose phallus resembled a metre-long heat seeking moisture missile. (Metaphor intended.)<br />
About halfway along Highway 50, just outside Gunnison, we stopped for pictures at a kind of picnic area. The road into the small park had an interesting feature that I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and that we saw almost continually until we reached Louisiana: a large steel grating made of parallel bars. It ran between the fence posts at either side of the road. I was justifiably curious, not knowing what it was. Stefan was quick to explain that animals, particularly cloven ones, are unable to cross the grating. It saves money as you don&#8217;t have to build or maintain a gate.<br />
The roadway inside the tiny reserve was poor, not likely having been repaired in some time. But the park did have one thing that I found useful &#8212; a Johnny-On-The-Spot. Not exactly the Ritz as far as the smell is concerned, but a welcome relief nonetheless.<br />
The view from the lookout was breathtaking. The lookout was perched right on the edge of a hill, which quickly dropped just below us. Just a few miles ahead was Gunnison, laying part way into a vast plain. Across it were more mountains. I took out the panoramic for another picture, pausing just before taking it when I had a much better idea.<br />
I had Rebecca, Dhar and Stefan position themselves in the middle and at the edges of the viewfinder so that they effectively split the picture in three. As it turned out, the picture looked pretty good (for a disposable camera with a cheap plastic lens), although I found that the viewfinder is a little smaller than the lens&#8217; view when I saw the picture two weeks later.<br />
Just outside Gunnison, on the other side of town, we came across the Blue Mesa reservoir. Somewhere down river, one of the Governments (either State or Federal) had built a dam, creating the reservoir. But this reservoir was strangely depleted. We had arrived at the reservoir just following the spring run-off, during which a reservoir should be filled almost to the limit. Yet the water level was at least 30 feet below what appeared to be the normal water line.<br />
Huge strips of land connected what would normally be islands with the shore. Exposed lake bed glowed a yellowish-brown, marked with a few large rocks every so often. Stefan and I commented to each other repeatedly about the water level, several times trying to get Rebecca and Dhar to express any interest in the phenomenon. But they were too engrossed in their card game to really care too much.<br />
After cross a bridge to the south side of the reservoir, we stopped a little ways down at an interesting mesa hillside visible on the north side of the reservoir. Erosion had cut tall fingers out of the hill, creating a sort of effect of someone having dragged a huge comb through the soil.<br />
About an hour later we reached Montrose, where Highway 50 ended. The sun was beginning to set on us, and I was beginning to have serious doubts of getting to Cortez before 20:00 that evening. A quick calculation proved that the earliest we could get there was at 21:30, well past the KOA&#8217;s office hours. We turned onto Highway 550 for our half-hour trip to Ridgway where we would pick up Route 62, continuing the Scenic Route.<br />
The shadows grew long, hiding all the trees and cliffs. Soon all around us was darkness, and a desperate need to go to the bathroom. Montrose looked deserted when we passed it, so we had to continue in our quest for relief. I suggested we get familiar with the on-board toilet. However, a certain member of our regiment steadfastly insisted she could last.<br />
Soon we reached Route 145, which would take us indirectly to Cortez. I refuse to say &#8220;directly&#8221; because the road weaved in and out of hills and valleys in a huge zig-zag. The first major bend was just outside of Telluride, where we found an open gas station. Although we didn&#8217;t need any fuel, we all needed to relieve ourselves and stock up on liquids and chocolate, the latter being a not-so-good idea.<br />
The moon was out that night, and was very bright. Unfortunately, it was hard to see it amongst all the trees. Dhar took over from Stefan, who took over navigating from me. I perched myself behind Stefan and peered out the windows to try and see anything in the dark. Through rare breaks in the trees I could see valleys, small mountain peaks, and the odd house. Otherwise, it was a series of black blobs.<br />
About 30 miles out of Cortez, we finally hit some excitement. As we came around a corner, we saw the flashing lights of a police car, in this case a Bronco. A cop had set up flares and positioned his car to prevent people from hitting a small landslide that had blocked part of the lane we were driving in. Dhar passed the cop slowly, allowing us to peer out at what we might have hit had the cop not been there to warn us. It was then that I realized just how dangerous that part of the trip had been. A heaving run-off could have dislodged a large rock, taking out the van with a single blow.<br />
The excitement didn&#8217;t end there however. About ten miles later, we caught a glimpse of the clean-up crew racing to the landslide. The first vehicle in line was a dumptruck with a plow on the front. I don&#8217;t know how fast he was going, but he came within a foot of hitting us, enough to make the four of us hold our breaths for a moment, then swear in unison that we weren&#8217;t all killed. Almost right behind the truck was a front-end loader that kept his distance.<br />
Almost as quickly as we entered the mountains, we exited them. Before us were the lights of Cortez, a city of only 7,300, but with enough lights to block out some of the stars in the sky. We pulled over just outside of the forests and gazed up for a few moments. Stefan remarked that Rainy River was much better, having no lights brighter than a 100 watt bulb. We piled back in and kept on driving.<br />
Route 145 ended at Highway 160, which coincidentally enough was where the KOA was located. We turned left, drove about 100 feet, and headed in for a late check-in. Stefan gathered up his wallet, bounded out the door, and went over to be frustrated by the late check-in booth. This was the first time we had ever checked in late, so this was a whole new experience for Stefan.<br />
He stared at the instructions for a few minutes, then came back for a pen he could write with. I never asked Stefan if he knew what on Earth he was doing, I figured he&#8217;d always answer &#8220;yes&#8221; regardless if he did or not. But it always took quite a while to get checked in every night we came in late. I don&#8217;t know if it was a result of him trying to figure out the cost when the discount was figured in or not, but nonetheless it took a while. Eventually, he returned with a map of the camp, indicating where we were to park.<br />
We drove almost all the way around the park before we finally found the right slot. Then we drove around to the other side so we could properly pull through. Once Dhar had us in place, I hopped out with the keys and proceeded to get us hooked up.<br />
Dinner had us in a heated discussion for about ten minutes before deciding on peanut butter and honey sandwiches. None of us were in the mood for cooking, and were all pretty tapped out from all the driving we had done that day. I figured in part the lack of will was due to us not being comfortable at the high altitude. During the day, we had traveled over 10,000 feet vertically (over 5,000 up and another 5,000 down) and all the pressure change had my ears nearly ringing.<br />
To go along with our light meal was the wine Stefan and Dhar had purchased in Woodland Park. Three large plastic cups were partially filled with the cheap spirits, whilst I drank of Coke. I normally don&#8217;t mind wine (at least not since I started drinking at New Year&#8217;s that year), but the kind I prefer starts at $20 a litre. The gallon they bought was around $4.<br />
The sandwiches filled a nutritional void that needed to be filled, we were quite satisfied that we could now go to sleep without a serious argument from our stomachs. Stefan and I were undoubtedly a different situation, but the both of us would agree that even a little food is much better than no food at all. One other advantage with making sandwiches was a minimalist clean up.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960423.227</strong><br />
<em>Day 3</em><br />
This can be easily defined as perhaps one of the most beautiful days in my life.We didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to go up Pikes Peak, the result of finally figuring out what the hell we were doing. We went to the Cave of the Winds, an uphill drive (and downhill) I&#8217;ll not soon forget.<br />
We spent almost as much time on the road as in Kansas, but the sights were much better.<br />
Finally arriving in Cortez, we scarfed down peanut butter sandwiches for &#8220;dinner&#8221; and everyone (sans moi) is getting drunk on cheap wine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was the alcoholic content of the wine, the change in altitude, or the phase of the moon but Rebecca got loony very quickly. By loony, I mean more or less drunk. Being the Observer, I know what drunk people are like &#8230; I&#8217;ve known hundreds, and this year became one of them. So I know drunk. Rebecca was not &#8220;hammered&#8221; or &#8220;blitzed&#8221;, but she was, to take a line from Pink Floyd, comfortably numb.<br />
The wine didn&#8217;t seem to affect Stefan or Dhar much, except the slight redness in Dhar&#8217;s nose, so we concentrated on Rebecca&#8217;s antics. When that got boring (right about when the bottle was emptied), we began talking about whatever came to mind.<br />
Take a set of young adults, give them alcohol, put them in a confined space and 99 times out of 100, they&#8217;ll end up on sex. Not necessarily participate in the act of sex (although that is a possibility), but discussion almost invariably leads to sex. I really have to wonder why psychologists have never studied this. Is it a preoccupation? I know it is with men (being one, I feel I can speak confidently for the whole), but is it with women? I can&#8217;t say Rebecca speaks for the whole of women, since she&#8217;s preoccupied with it for different reasons &#8212; she already has had kids, and is a sex expert in her line of employment.<br />
Nevertheless, we ended up talking about sex. Specifics I cannot recall, since I was not only fairly tired, but the number of such discussions I have had prior and since that night have irreversibly garbled what memory of particulars I had of that evening.<br />
What I do remember of that evening was Dhar&#8217;s silence. Rebecca did most of the talking, Stefan and I accounting for about only half the discussion. It was then that I realized that Dhar was insecure about the subject. At first I thought he was just a kindred spirit to myself &#8212; too shy to ask, too desperate to get it. But his general lack of contribution, even when prompted, told a totally different story. Sex was not quite taboo, but it was something very private to him and not open for discussion at any time. I sympathized with him, having to listen to the three of us babble away while he patiently sat there and waited for us to finish.<br />
Somewhere close to 01:00, we decided that sleep was not a bad idea. The plans for the following day were to visit the Four Corners and the Grand Canyon, getting into Las Vegas sometime around 20:00 that night.<br />
I pulled my bed out as usual, but Dhar decided that he was going to try a different way of sleeping, and simply tilted his chair back. Dhar spent the night sleeping in a reclined seated position, facing the rear of the van. It didn&#8217;t stop him snoring through, he began than less than five minutes after the lights went out&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The rain came down so heavily I have yet to see an adjective to properly describe it &#8212; &#8220;sheets&#8221; is not hard enough, and &#8220;Niagara Falls&#8221; is far too much. Somewhere in between will have to suffice until a proper word can be agreed upon. Needless to say though, Rebecca was none too thrilled with having to drive through it.<br />
I personally believe that any person, regardless of sex or race, is capable of anything when dead set on doing something &#8230; except for a few cases. This happened to be one of them. Rebecca was visibly nervous about driving the van, even more so when visibility dropped to less than 100 feet. I know that when I get stuck with something potentially dangerous, and someone more capable than I is nearby, I ask for help. I also know that it&#8217;s the strong people who seldom ask for help. Intelligence be damned &#8212; pride is a hard thing to overcome. (I&#8217;ll dispense with the Pulp Fiction quotes.)<br />
Rebecca pulled off I-70 and into a closed gas station, amidst a flurry of road reconstruction. (The construction theme was one we would see many times throughout our trip, this was the first major encounter for us.) Unlike others that would follow, this didn&#8217;t greatly affect our travel.<br />
Under the canopy of the gas bar, Rebecca relinquished her seat to Dhar. He promptly set about getting the mirrors exactly where he wanted them. This gave us all a chance to get up for a moment and stretch out before getting back onto the Interstate. A moment later, Dhar pulled out from under the canopy, drove out into the chewed-up road, up the on-ramp and back onto the highway. And into a storm the likes of which I had never seen before.<br />
The rain we encountered briefly with Rebecca had been hard and steady &#8230; but short. Almost as soon as we had pulled off the highway, the rain had slowed to a trickle. None of us chose to see this as a sign, or at least if anyone did they kept quiet. When Dhar took over driving, we entered a four hour maelstrom of water, lightning, and wind.<br />
(Author&#8217;s note: About a week after we returned home, the mid-west, including a good portion of the states we drove through, experienced serious flooding as a result of heavier-than-usual rainfall.)<br />
Less than a half hour after leaving the gas station, the wind began to pick up again. This disappointed us because we firmly believed that the head-wind we had coming from Oakville had given us our less-than-excellent gas mileage. It also made driving more difficult. But the wind wasn&#8217;t the result of the heating of the Earth&#8217;s surface, as had the wind some twelve hours earlier &#8212; this wind was the result of a cold front. A cold front that brought us the worst storm I have ever seen.<br />
The rain started coming down shortly after the wind started. Every ten minutes the rain&#8217;s volume doubled, likening the downpour more to Niagara Falls than a sheet. Even with the windshield wipers on full we could hardly see. For a short period, Dhar reduced speed to keep us from hitting something or sliding off the road.<br />
Flashes in the distance continued to come closer and closer, until we were surrounded by lightening. The sight was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I have loved lightning storms for many years now (despite that when I was a kid, I was scared to death of them), and although we saw only a few truly spectacular bolts, those that we did see ranked among the most spectacular of my life. Not long after we entered the lightning portion of the storm, Stefan decided to make me feel like a little kid again.<br />
&#8220;Is this van shielded?&#8221; he asked. Being a non-engineer, and being rather uneducated in vehicular safety outside of seat belts, airbags, anti-lock brakes, and drink holders big enough to hold a jumbo Slurpee(r), I had no idea what Stefan was referring to. He explained that most cars (and by most, I am referring to any car you can buy from a dealer) are electrically shielded. If struck by lightning on the roof, the charge is carried down the walls and out through the bottom simply by the way the car is constructed.<br />
As Stefan was quick to point out, the roof of the van wasn&#8217;t metal &#8212; it was fibreglass and plastic. The last time I checked, the only thing you could conduct with fibreglass or plastic was an orchestra. I knew there was a wrap-around antenna for the television, but I didn&#8217;t know if Home &amp; Park had installed a grounding strip to draw any outside electrical current into the metal body of the van. I had a vision of a bolt suddenly bursting through the ceiling and vapourizing us where we sat. I tried to think of any recorded lightning strikes on a moving motorhome &#8230; and drew a blank. Nevertheless, I quickly found myself wondering when we would be exiting the storm.<br />
Stefan, now having successfully frightened me into staying awake watching for lightning strikes, wandered to the rear bed where Rebecca was already asleep. Rebecca got more sleep during the trip than Stefan, Dhar and I combined. I&#8217;m not complaining, I think she deserved it &#8212; mothers with small children get so little sleep. I know my parents took every opportunity to get away from my sister and I to relax, so I could hold nothing against Stefan and Rebecca.<br />
Dhar continued to drive through the night, wrestling the wind and the rain. The two of us talked, played music, and stared out into the lonely stormy night. Every so often we were passed by a semi-trailer driving about ten miles an hour faster than us, which naturally made Dhar and I a little leery of sliding off the road into a fiery death. Appealing as it may be to some, we had intentions of making it at least as far as Vegas before committing ritual suicide<br />
Over the course of several hours, the storm lessened in strength until at last all that was left was an overcast sky. At around 05:30, we entered Kansas City Limits. I should also point out at this time that we had already crossed into the Central Time Zone, and our clock was dutifully adjusted whenever we crossed any time zone.<br />
The amount of traffic in Kansas City was negligible, rush hour wasn&#8217;t for at least another hour. And this time we would hit rush hour &#8212; it was now Monday morning. Soon we were skirting in and around the overpasses and underpasses that made up the downtown core of Kansas City. Several times the wind blew us around, and scared the hell out of Dhar because he wasn&#8217;t ready. In a little more than a half hour, the city limits were again approaching, as was a minor change in our roadway status.<br />
We entered onto the Kansas Turnpike. Unfortunately for us, this was a toll road. Doubly unfortunate, there was no way to avoid it (if we had tried to stay on I-70, we would&#8217;ve ended up in Wichita). For me, this was the first time I had ever been on a toll road where you paid to get off, not on. At the first booth, we took a ticket from the gate attendant, and proceeded on our way. Almost immediately, Dhar noted that we couldn&#8217;t exceed the speed limit here, since the attendant at the other end would know if we tried to go too fast by the amount of time it took us to get there.<br />
By this time the sun had begun to rise, and the two in the back slowly began to wake up. Stefan had mentioned shortly before joining Rebecca that he wanted to see the sun rise that morning, and left orders with us to wake him at that time. As it turned out, he awoke before the sun could really be seen (the clouds remained for quite some time that morning, and didn&#8217;t burn off until after noon.)<br />
Stefan, becoming more aware of where he was, suddenly realized that he&#8217;d been there before several years previous. He remembered rest stops in the middle of the Turnpike. As he explained it, somewhere along the turnpike was a restaurant and a gas station &#8230; in the middle of the road. Odd, perhaps, but it didn&#8217;t change the fact that while Stefan remembered that they existed, he couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where.<br />
As the ambient daylight increased, our fuel supply decreased, both automobile and human alike. Then the blue and white sign appeared before us: Rest Stop, 1 Mile. Another sign soon indicated that we would exit not on the right side of the road, but the left. Stefan&#8217;s memory seemed quite accurate, if incomplete.<br />
Once again I will state for the record that while Americans can build the best highways in the world, they have no concept of merging. Putting on-ramps and off-ramps along the faster lanes is just poor planning, regardless of efficiency. Unless you happen to drive a vehicle with a turbo-charged V12, or happen to have solid-rocket boosters strapped to the side of your minivan, you&#8217;re potential roadkill. The length of American on-ramps and off-ramps is also horrible, quite often being less than 20 feet. I know of few vehicles that can accelerate to 60 miles per hour in less than 20 feet. The Behemoth isn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
We pulled off the road shortly after 06:30, and pulled up to a Hardee&#8217;s, the American equivalent to Harvey&#8217;s. We were hungry, but the foremost thing on my mind was using the toilet. I opened my door, and my skin immediately started crawling, desperately trying to get away from the cold. We had started our travel south, but the warm weather we so desperately wanted was not yet to be felt. I quickly jogged around the side of the beige brick building, and found the entrance.<br />
I quickly realized that this was a truck stop. I define a truck stop as any restaurant that wouldn&#8217;t accommodate most families. This one wouldn&#8217;t accommodate most families of roaches, let alone me. I quickly entered the Men&#8217;s Room and even more swiftly, emptied my bladder into the first available urinal. Several large, mostly overweight men were milling about, in various states of relieving themselves. I opted not to start a conversation.<br />
A moment later, I was back at the van, warning the rest not to eat there, adding that the restrooms should be considered &#8220;last resorts&#8221;. I expected more opposition, but I guess there&#8217;s always a good solid line between food and sanitation. Hey, we might have been university students, but even we had our limits.<br />
But the gas was cheap, so we took the opportunity to fill our tank. The wind was chilly, maybe 10 degrees Celsius, my hands nearly froze to the pump handle. Wearing shorts probably didn&#8217;t help matters much.<br />
I took over driving again, feeling fairly awake considering my lack of sleep. I assumed that my excitement to be someplace new was enough to keep me going. (That, and the rude awakening from running around in the cold while wearing shorts.) I honestly wondered how long I could keep it up. Pulling out into the turnpike turned out not to be too severe a problem &#8212; there was no-one else driving that early on a Monday morning.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we found ourselves at the end of our jaunt along the Kansas Turnpike, as it began to arc towards Wichita, which was away from our planned route (kind of like Syndey, Australia is out of the way of Paris, France). We paid our $1.75 toll and returned to the I-70. We drove for only a couple hours before hunger got the better of Dhar, Rebecca, and myself. Despite his proclaimed starvation at the Hardee&#8217;s earlier, sleep overcame the walking stomach (Stefan), and he crawled back into bed. The rest of us kept watch for a restaurant.<br />
Finding restaurants along Interstates turned out to be a relatively easy prospect. Whenever an exit sign appeared, it was usually followed by three more signs. Each of these signs indicated which gas stations, hotels, and restaurants were available at each exit. This, for us, was a big benefit because it kept us from having to get off the Interstate and wander around needlessly wasting gas. So whenever we got mildly esurient, we kept watch for restaurant signs and bickered about which places we weren&#8217;t going.<br />
With Stefan mostly asleep, we took the first exit the three of us agreed on &#8212; Perkins. It wasn&#8217;t Rebecca&#8217;s first choice for fine eating &#8212; nor anyone else with a heartbeat &#8212; several times she had mentioned that Perkins was prone to bad food and horrible service. This was her experience. I, on the other hand, had never been to a Perkins before and had no qualms about giving it a try.<br />
Rebecca, Dhar, and I got ready to go for breakfast while Stefan steadfastly stuck to staying in bed. It was ironic that the human garborator, who only an hour or two earlier had professed his undying need for nourishment, was in fact &#8220;too tired&#8221; to eat. Having formerly held a similar title in eating, I knew that there was no such thing as &#8220;too tired&#8221;. But I wasn&#8217;t about to try and move him. I figured we&#8217;d just leave him to his stomach.<br />
The Perkins was nearly empty. This I found somewhat surprising considering that it was now past seven o&#8217;clock and most people would be ready to eat. Then again, it was a Monday morning in a small town whose only link to the outside world seemed to be through the Interstate. What appeared to be the main road ran under the Interstate, and every building of significance seemed to be within a mile of the Interstate, including the Perkins.<br />
The waitress appeared almost as soon as we had sat down. We ordered up two coffees and one orange juice (I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, drink coffee &#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;d be like wired on that much caffeine). Rebecca chided me for not having coffee, proclaiming that I should &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; and be a little more adventurous (I got that a lot during the trip &#8212; I&#8217;m a conservative in rebel clothing). I didn&#8217;t want to get addicted to coffee, I have found dependence to something during long journeys can be distracting. As it stands, I actually considered having coffee after a taste of my orange juice &#8230; rather, my glass of Tang.<br />
Almost as soon as the waitress disappeared with our drink order, Stefan stumbled in through the entrance. We knew that he&#8217;d be along sooner or later, you simply can&#8217;t sleep when your stomach wants to be satisfied. He sat down across from Rebecca and announced wearily that he was hungry. We restrained the urge to snicker. When the waitress returned a moment later with our beverages, she was visibly confused, wondering if she had accidentally missed a person the first time. Stefan smiled sheepishly and ordered a coffee.<br />
As for the food, I chose a decidedly large breakfast of a three-egg omelette, pancakes, hash browns, and sausages. By the time I finished eating, I was quite satisfied. I felt ready to tackle another large chunk of America. Stefan&#8217;s and Dhar&#8217;s means were variants on each other, and of equivalent size to mine. Only Rebecca ate less &#8230; and even then, not by much. Stefan woke up the more he ate, by the end of breakfast he looked completely alert. However, that might have been due to the coffee&#8230;<br />
Stefan picked up the tab for breakfast that morning, but we added it to the log of expenses so we could figure out how much we owed him at a later date. This was a pattern that would continue for the rest of the trip. It make figuring out bills a lot easier.<br />
Outside the wind was still blowing hard and cold, I made a quick return to the van to get it started. Rebecca made mention of stopping somewhere for food and drinks, but I was more intent on getting back on the road. I figured that we&#8217;d find what we wanted at the next gas stop.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960422.075</strong><br />
<em>Day 2</em><br />
Despite a storm of biblical proportions, we&#8217;ve made it into Kansas. I&#8217;m surviving on about 2 hours sleep &#8230; does it ever hurt.We&#8217;ve run into our first major argument &#8211; namely where the hell this damn trip is going. I personally want to hit all the places in our itinerary, but Stefan seems to want to keep us in the Colorado Springs area. I was planning only on about 2 days, but now that&#8217;s up to 4 &#8230; we&#8217;ll figure this out somewhere.<br />
Becka survived her initial stint of about 10 miles at the helm, but she caught the very front of that storm, and we moved Dhar in instead. 9 hours to our last stop.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus we truly began our nine hour odyssey across Kansas. Of all the states we visited, Kansas would be the last state I would ever settle in. It&#8217;s too flat. The Interstates go on for hundreds of miles in straight lines. There&#8217;s nothing to see for hours on end. The distance markers never seem to change. (If you haven&#8217;t already gotten the picture, it&#8217;s unbelievably boring.)<br />
Somewhere in the galactic schemes of things, Kansas has become the place where time and space have no meaning. You can exist there for hours and get nowhere. True believers think that all the strangeness exists in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. No-one has even considered Kansas. No-one knows that its original settlers still live there, not having ever grown old. It&#8217;s a little known fact, and Kansasites want to keep it that way &#8212; waiting for the day their people come from Borotron to capture the Earth. Mark my words: when aliens take over the Earth, their capital will be in Kansas!<br />
Boredom, thy name is Kansas. I was so strung out from crossing the Sunflower State, when I saw a bumpiness just on the horizon, I swore they were mountains. Everyone else was telling me they were just clouds, but I didn&#8217;t want to believe it. By this time Stefan had assumed the driver&#8217;s position, and I became obsessed with leaving the wide open spaces for something a little more feature-ridden. To my despair, the bumpiness turned out to be only clouds forming into strange shapes, that I wrongly assumed could have only been formed near large formations in the Earth. I never did find out how those clouds formed, but we didn&#8217;t see any real mountains until a few hours later.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Kansas wasn&#8217;t the first mostly flat place I&#8217;d been. My mother was born in Saskatchewan, which is almost in the middle of the great Canadian plains. The plains I knew best were the ones from Saskatoon to Prince Albert, a distance of about 200 kilometres. There the land is reasonably flat, but with a fair number of rolling hills and the odd valley or two. My mother testifies that the southern portion of Saskatchewan, out by Regina, is flatter than the proverbial pancake. Having never been further south than Saskatoon, I didn&#8217;t know. Kansas is awfully like the southern portion of Saskatchewan, only flatter.<br />
It was while we drove endlessly through Kansas that I first heard of &#8220;highway hypnosis&#8221;. I learned that during long trips, especially in places with nothing to look at except straight lines with few curves (I won&#8217;t mention any six-letter mid-American agricultural states), you tend to start not noticing things. At first you miss the odd road sign. Then it&#8217;s how fast you&#8217;re going. Pretty soon you don&#8217;t notice the semi-trailers carrying large red farm equipment heading directly for you because you drifted over into a lane you didn&#8217;t know existed. None of us seemed to succumb to the potentially fatal problem, but then again we tended to talk too much while we were driving.<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, our first sign of progress appeared: the Kansas / Colorado border. We felt like celebrating, like we had accomplished some great feat of endurance that no human had ever before had done. But even from that point, we still had another hour and a half before we would leave the I-70 and take State Highway 24 to Colorado Springs. So we settled for a rousing rendition of: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re in Kansas anymore!&#8221;<br />
As we rounded a large rain storm just to the south of us, I caught a glimpse of my first mountain. Until then the largest mountain I had ever seen were in the Laurentian Mountains in Quebec, part of the Appalachian Mountains. Much older than the Rocky Mountains, the Laurentians are also much shorter. Stefan was quick to note that although spectacular, even the mountains in the Colorado section of the Rocky Mountains were small when compared to the ones in British Columbia and Alberta.<br />
Before we knew it the land was bubbling with mountains, most of them capped with high snowy peaks. Some a leftover of a strong winter, the rest due to their height. Never before had I imagined such a sight. Sure, I had read literally hundreds of books and articles on mountains and mountain ranges, and seen countless feet of footage in movies and documentaries, but nothing in the world could have prepared me for the sight I beheld.<br />
And nothing could have prepared us for what still lay on the ground. Snow. Winter in most of Canada that year had been particularly long and harsh. Part of the trip, for me at least, was to escape the winter for at least two weeks. The snow had melted in Canada some two to three weeks earlier. But in Colorado, patches of snow still clung to the ground like a frightened child to its mother. I suddenly felt a little depressed. Long winters tend to do that to a person.<br />
The van was beginning to act rather strangely, even for a vehicle that hadn&#8217;t been fully broken in yet. I assumed the problems stemmed from our altitude. Just from entering Colorado alone, we had climbed to an altitude of some 4,000 feet above sea level. Oakville, by comparison, is only about 300 to 400 feet above sea level. The higher we climbed, the less air there was for the van to use. Even I started feeling a little light-headed after a while.<br />
When we reached the junction of the I-70 and Highway 24, we quickly found ourselves traveling through the quaint little town of Limon, elevation 5,360 feet. I wondered how strange we looked to the locals, seeing a large white van-cum-motorhome speeding through small 4&#215;4&#8217;s, pickups and cars. The roads weren&#8217;t as nice as the Interstate, but as Stefan had been waiting to see, the roads were pink.<br />
Yes, pink.<br />
In most places around America, the roads are made with black sand. Don&#8217;t ask me why, this is just the way of things. But believe it or not, black sand is expensive, at least to carry to places like Colorado. There they made use of local materials instead. And in Colorado, not to forget Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, some of the readily available materials, namely the sand, is red. The result is pink roads.<br />
And you thought Highway Hypnosis on black roads was troublesome.<br />
The question of residence was raised not long after we entered Colorado. We still hadn&#8217;t decided where we were going to be spending the night. A partial decision had been made some time earlier that we stay at a campsite, but which one was still up in the air. Thus we dove into the RV Campsite book that my father had received from the Mobilife, who had sold us the Behemoth.<br />
The Campsite book is concise and complete, listing every single campsite across North America. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s also several inches thick. After several debates on the services we wanted to have available, we decided on the Garden of the Gods campground, which was on the opposite side of Colorado Springs to the side we were entering. I wasn&#8217;t too thrilled with having to cross an unknown city, but for a pool and hot-tub, it seemed like a good idea. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Colorado Springs city limits came into view.<br />
Under most situations, the navigator doesn&#8217;t do very much. When passing through a city, the navigator makes sure the driver doesn&#8217;t accidentally take an off-ramp into the downtown core, or get onto a different highway that takes us to Timbuktu. And that&#8217;s in the worst of conditions, they last usually no more than a half hour. (At night, the navigator is also helpful at keeping the driver awake.) When we actually get off into a city, that&#8217;s a whole other issue.<br />
I was pulling navigator duty when we arrived in Colorado Springs, somewhere around 17:30 in the afternoon. Unfortunately, this meant rush hour. So far, we had managed to avoid any major form of vehicular traffic, something we liked. It kept our travel time lower, not to mention our stress levels. But it had become time to face the music and get stuck in the thick of things.<br />
We got off Highway 24 onto Power Boulevard and headed south to Fountain Street. The idea was to get us to the other side of the city as easily as possible so we could find Colorado Avenue. This, according to the Campsite book, was where we would find the Garden of the Gods campground. What the Campsite book didn&#8217;t tell us was how hard it would be to get across the city with our asses still attached to our rear ends.<br />
We barely missed going the wrong way at an intersection and almost landed on I-25. As it turns out, that in itself wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad, but I would&#8217;ve had to figure out which exit to then get off. (No, I&#8217;m not that bad a navigator, but it was first proverbial kick at the cat, so I wasn&#8217;t entirely confident in my abilities at that point.) Eventually we made it over to Cascade Avenue, which we would then take up to Colorado.<br />
We noticed something about Colorado Springs almost immediately &#8212; it was clean. Not just a general lack of garbage in the streets, but an overall appearance of cleanliness. There was no dirt on the roads, the grass was cut, there seemed to be no pollution &#8230; even the trees seemed to be polished. It was like driving through a Disney-created city. Disturbing is too soft a term to describe what I felt, and frightened is too harsh.<br />
Many Americans, when they come to Canada, marvel at how clean our cities are. After many years, many Canadians would probably beg to differ with those Americans. Many of these Canadians, however, haven&#8217;t been to the United States. For a Canadian, then, to call an American city &#8220;clean&#8221; is nothing short of high praise. Colorado Springs was nearly spotless. To this date, I still proclaim that there are two cities in the United States I would move to. My first choice is Colorado Springs. (My second choice is New Orleans, which has got to be Colorado Springs&#8217; antithesis. Go figure that one, eh?)<br />
We debated on the reason for the cleanliness. One of our conclusions was that Colorado Springs is a military city, containing both Fort Carson and the Peterson Air Force Base. All the military spending might spill into the city, either allowing or forcing the city to keep itself clean. Another reason that we either initially ignored or forgot was that Colorado Springs is also a large tourist attraction in that part of Colorado. The tourist dollars (a few of which we contributed) simply allow a solid cleanup effort.<br />
But even clean cities still have rush hour traffic. (Though I&#8217;d forgotten about that?) I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it then, and I&#8217;m still not sure what to make of it now. The veteran of some of the worst traffic jams Toronto has to offer, I&#8217;ve seen (and experienced) some of the worst rush hours in North America. Colorado Springs, population 247,700, is the only major point of population in its area &#8212; rush hour probably only lasts an hour, if that. This I determined from sitting at the corner of Cascade and Colorado.<br />
It looked like the intersection of any non-descript small city. No buildings nearby over three stories, lots of trees, lampposts that were at least 15 years old (not that it&#8217;s a bad thing, they added a lot of character), meridians down the middle complete with trees and grass &#8230; it was very picturesque. It was also full of cars.<br />
We were in the left turning lane, the sole vehicle trying to turn from Cascade onto Colorado. We waited patiently for all the traffic in the on-coming lane to disperse so we could continue on our way. But one of the vehicles in the on-coming lane was a semi-trailer with a flatbed. He was way too close to the edge of the road. And apparently not too experienced with going around corners.<br />
Trucks like that normally take very wide right hand turns, mostly to compensate for the length and inflexibility of the trailers. Remember I said &#8220;normally&#8221;. This guy either got stuck in the rightmost lane, or was a beginner and no idea what he was doing. He started turning left and quickly found that he was going to take out the traffic light control box if he continued forward. He was blocking our exit, and the lights were about to change. Rebecca, Dhar, and I quickly urged Stefan to back up before we started blocking traffic. The urge was particularly strong because we hadn&#8217;t anyone else behind us at the time, and I didn&#8217;t know how long that would last.<br />
We had backed up just as the lights changed. The truck however, was still stuck in the intersection, waiting for the traffic to disperse in the lanes in front of him so he could pull forward more before turning. This caused the traffic wanting to cross the intersection to have to wait until the truck was gone before they could go. I began to wonder how many lights we were going to have to sit through to see this problem resolved. By the end of the light cycle, the truck was driving off, and the cars on Colorado were crossing Cascade. But with no advanced green or an arrow to let us go, we had to wait for traffic on Cascade to filter out.<br />
But soon we were on Colorado heading east, towards what we hoped would be our campground. It was then I found out an interesting thing about Colorado &#8212; the roads like to move around. It turned out that somewhere along the line, Colorado shifted to the next road north. We were back on Highway 24. And surrounded by morons, like the woman in a teeny tiny little car who decided she would pass us on our right as Stefan began to make a lane change. She even had the gall to honk at us like it was our fault. Some drivers should just be run off the road and be taken out of everyone&#8217;s misery. But I will say one thing about American drivers: on a whole, they have far more common sense than most of the drivers in Southern Ontario.<br />
We passed under the overpass for the I-25 and quickly came to another lighted intersection, just changing red in our direction. Dhar immediately noticed a series of cooling towers to our left. Our initial impulse was a nuclear power station, prompting Dhar to sing (to the tune of The Flintstones theme): &#8220;Simpson &#8230; Homer Simpson &#8230; he&#8217;s the greatest man in history! From the &#8230; town of Springfield &#8230; he&#8217;s about to hit a chestnut tree!&#8221; Like I already said, Dhar and I drove Rebecca crazy with our Simpson&#8217;s references.<br />
I dismissed the notion of a nuclear power plant being so deep inside a city, and so far away from a major source of water. I guessed it was a power plant fired by natural resources (like coal), or even perhaps a geothermal station (about which I was somewhat doubtful, as I didn&#8217;t know of any geothermal activity in that area). Either way, we didn&#8217;t get too long a look as the light soon changed and we drove on through.<br />
In Colorado Springs, there is at least one intelligent city road planner. This was the person who saw it necessary to install small junctions from Highway 24 across a small valley to Colorado Avenue. A good thing, otherwise we&#8217;d have driven into the mountains, which was where we didn&#8217;t want to go. This got us closer to where we wanted to be, but even then we weren&#8217;t certain. Tensions grew and tempers shortened as each person tried to give directions to the campground we couldn&#8217;t find.<br />
One thing I should also note about navigators &#8212; only one navigator should be allowed to navigate, otherwise confusion seems to reign supreme. The Campsite book was in the possession of Dhar and Rebecca, neither of whom were the current navigator, both of whom read out differing accounts of the same directions to take us to Garden of the Gods, and both became more irritated when Stefan was unable to comply with their instructions. Stefan, in a vain attempt to figure out what both of them were trying to say, drove up Colorado until we entered Manitou, a suburb of Colorado Springs. At this point, we all agreed that we&#8217;d gone too far.<br />
Frustrated, we turned around and came back, still not sure of where we were going. Stefan decided to take things into his own hands and darted up Garden of the Gods Road, thinking that maybe the campground might be located on that street. At the time, the idea couldn&#8217;t have hurt &#8212; eight eyes all missed the entrance twice.<br />
But up Garden of the Gods Road, we found the road&#8217;s namesake &#8212; Garden of the Gods Park. I had briefly read something about the park in the AAA TourBook (r) for Colorado / Utah, and it seemed like an interesting place to visit. I hadn&#8217;t expected to see it on our arrival, but the break was more than welcome &#8230; especially since we were probably only minutes from starting to scream and yell at each other.<br />
Stefan drove up the winding road, walls of trees and rock sprouted on either side of a the road for a moment, then gave way to a large reddish ochre rock wall as the road turned. In the wall was a large V-shaped crack running vertically, and at the top of the crack was a large boulder of the same colour as the wall upon which it sat. That alone wasn&#8217;t as impressive as what lay around another turn.<br />
Immediately I understood the reason why someone had named the park &#8220;Garden of the Gods&#8221;. The portion we could see was a shallow bowl-shaped valley, surrounded by large mountains of the same reddish-ochre rock. The mountains were inconsequential when compared to the neighbouring Rockies, but the Rockies lacked the bold colour.<br />
The rocks were likely a sandstone, formed many millions of years ago when the Colorado Springs area sat under 50 feet of ocean. Over the years, the water level dropped and the land level rose, exposing the layer of stone to the elements. The wind and the rain carved the rock into a softly flowing, sweeping landscape. The valley that was left eventually filled with deep green foliage in the forms of shrubs and small trees. It could have been the playground for Zeus&#8217; children, for Venus&#8217; lovers, for Diana&#8217;s prey. It was now the plaything of the more outgoing members of the human race.<br />
Stefan pulled to the side of the road, mostly on our urging, Dhar and I immediately sprinted outside and started to take pictures. I took both my large 35 mm camera, and a small disposable Kodak panoramic camera I had bought just before we left. Alas, the pictures I took just didn&#8217;t bring out the vibrant hues that seemed to spill from every point in my view (even though I was using Kodak film, which tends more towards reds and oranges.)<br />
Dhar took a few pictures as did Stefan or Rebecca, depending on which one was using the camera at the time. We spend only a few minutes basking in the splendour before climbing back in the van, and proceeding down the road to try and find the campground.<br />
We drove slowly, partly so we could see all the scenery, partly because there were many pedestrians, bicyclists, and much smaller vehicles driving about, and Stefan probably wasn&#8217;t in the mood to crush anyone at the time. After rounding several corners, we stumbled across the General Store and Gift Shop, which seemed like an interesting place to stop temporarily and get directions to figure out where we were going. I also wanted to get more film.<br />
The store looked like a reconstruction of a stereotypical store one would expect in a stereotypical Western movie, with the exception of the stereotypical town drunk, and that the store was only a single-level establishment. Out front was a robotic cowboy, complete with poorly moving jaw and a computer-synthesized voice straight out of the Commodore 64 version of Impossible Mission by Epyx. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh not only at the antiquated technology as I walked by, but also at the other tourists who were taking pictures of it.<br />
This was one of few trips I have ever been on, in fact it may be the only trip, that I completely acknowledged the fact that I was a tourist. Many times I have gone out of my way to blend in, as not to look &#8220;dorky&#8221; or end up &#8220;sticking out like a sore thumb&#8221;. This usually occurs when I walk around with my camera slung around my neck. But this trip was different &#8212; I felt like acting like a tourist. Why? Just in case I was asked where I was from. That way I could tell people how much snow there was in Canada, that I have to take a dog sled team to work everyday, and that during certain times of the year we pay for things with ice because it&#8217;s too cold to carry money with you.<br />
And so we entered our first tourist trap of the trip. Inside was every single tacky souvenir you could possibly image &#8230; and a few you couldn&#8217;t. We spent a few minutes wandering around, seeing what annoying little gifts we would have to avoid buying over the next few days we were in Colorado. I bought another roll of film, and Stefan obtained directions to the campground.<br />
Unluckily for us, the directions we received were even more cryptic than the ones we had tried to follow about a half hour earlier. But part of the instructions we understood &#8212; go to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. This sounded at least partially feasible. So we all climbed back in the van again, and continued to follow the one-way road out towards what I believe to be 30th Street, which had the east entrance to the park. Just across the road was the Visitor&#8217;s Center.<br />
After a quick bought of indecision by yours truly on which entrance to use (there were two), Stefan drove south about 100 feet and turned into the driveway. He continued through the almost completely empty parking lot, and pulled up front the sliding glass doors. Two people walked in front of us as we pulled up, a man and a cigarette-smoking woman. Both of us seemed to cast a stare that said: &#8220;What the hell are you doing here?&#8221;<br />
The glance was in a way justified, the Center had closed, though when it had closed was indeterminable without getting out of the van, which none of us were really too keep about. We sighed, Stefan backed up and turned around, and then headed down 30th Street towards Colorado Avenue again.<br />
Part way down, he turned at a side street and headed west to another side road. Stefan barely slowed at the stop sign and turned south again. This road was interesting, as it was divided by a creek running down the centre of the road. The road was divided by about 20 to 30 feet, where it formed a concrete and stone &#8216;V&#8217;. Every so often, a small concrete bridge linked one side of the road with the other. The creek emptied into the valley that separated Highway 24 and Colorado Avenue.<br />
When we reached Colorado Avenue again, Stefan turned right and headed west one more time. Almost immediately the confusion we had tried to lose in the Garden of the Gods caught up, and we started arguing again. At a slight bend in the road a small road jutted to one side, which for us was going perfectly straight. I suggested to Stefan that he pull onto it for a moment until we figure out where we were. It didn&#8217;t seem to help much. But just as we were about to turn back to Colorado, a well-hidden sign right in front of us read: Garden of the Gods Campground. We let out a quiet cheer as Stefan pulled into the lot.<br />
The only campgrounds I had ever been to before were for tents. I hadn&#8217;t seen an RV park before, and wasn&#8217;t immediately impressed with Garden of the Gods. In hindsight, it was actually quite a nice looking place. Except for one small detail &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t quite open yet. As it turned out, we were the pre-season tourists.<br />
The main office was closed, but we were met by whom I assumed to be the caretaker. He explained the water and electrical hook-ups were available, but none of the facilities were really open yet, and only the toilets were usable &#8212; the showers wouldn&#8217;t be ready for a couple weeks. I was past the point of giving a shit, and was interested in getting hooked up for the night, eating, and getting some sleep. Both Stefan and Rebecca wanted a hot tub to relax in for a while.<br />
The caretaker suggested that we check out another campground just down the road which was listed as a &#8220;Good Sam Park&#8221; (whatever that&#8217;s supposed to mean). So we thanked the caretaker, suggested that we might be back (which I took to mean that only if the world came to an end and we felt the need to end our lives in a rush), climbed back into the van and left the campground.<br />
The Good Sam park wasn&#8217;t any better. It was much smaller, and it&#8217;s facilities weren&#8217;t open either &#8230; what few it had. We didn&#8217;t have to get out of the van before we decided that we weren&#8217;t staying there either. Stefan drove across a small bridge from Colorado Avenue, stopped briefly in front of the main office, drove around back, round to the front, across the bridge and back onto Colorado.<br />
Dhar started whining. He wanted a hotel room. Dhar was housebroken &#8212; he had never been camping before, in any form. An RV is a luxury for a camper, and for Dhar this was roughing it. Before the trip, he hadn&#8217;t had Kraft Dinner (or facsimiles), or anything else that seemed to go hand-in-hand with camping. I was surprised that he even had a sleeping bag.<br />
Everywhere along Colorado were hotels and motels advertising rooms for $30 or less. Stefan, Rebecca, and I flatly refused to give in so easily, opting to try and find the KOA that Stefan knew was in the area and settle in for the night. The only problem we seemed to have was finding the KOA. None of the maps we had seemed to indicate the exit we had to take to find the KOA, and while the instructions in the RV Campsite book were fairly good, Stefan&#8217;s last memory of trying to find the campsite was rough.<br />
Apparently, when Stefan had been in Colorado Springs the first time, he had stayed at the Kampgrounds Of America (KOA) in the south side of the city. But as he had tried to find it, the driver took a wrong turn, and landed in Fort Carson&#8217;s Tank Proving Grounds. Normally, you can&#8217;t miss this area, as the roads are lined with tank crossing signs.<br />
The first idea was to find the AAA office. Stefan knew that there we could get a KOA book, which would have much better directions to our destination. I guided Stefan onto the I-25 south, which would take us back to Highway 24 east. That in turn to Academy Boulevard, somewhere on which was supposed to be the AAA office.<br />
The route back to Academy Rd. was a little on the nerve-wracking side, having more cut-offs and merging streets than we could really handle after driving so long without a break, and arguing over where we were going. This culminated with me jumping the gun and leading Stefan up the wrong road. We still got to Academy, but we lost the advantage of a light to turn easily onto Academy. But Stefan was undaunted, and executed a perfect left turn, crossing two lanes of traffic and merging with a large flow of cars from the south.<br />
For five minutes we traveled north until we were where one of the maps said the AAA should be. However the map we were using was incorrect. The office was in reality in the north end of the city. This didn&#8217;t stop us from going through several of the strip malls, searching for the illusive AAA sign. After keeping this up for about ten minutes, and several &#8220;let&#8217;s try the next mall, just in case&#8221;, we gave up. Academy Road, alas, wasn&#8217;t there any longer &#8212; the road had split into one-way roads, with another strip mall in the middle.<br />
Stefan continued to mutter under his breath as he negotiated his way into the southbound lanes. While Stefan muttered, I looked through several maps and tried to piece together enough information to figure out where we were going. It took a few minutes, but I eventually determined where we needed to be. No-one said a word of hope or encouragement, partially due to lack of energy, partially in case I was wrong.<br />
As per my instructions, Stefan headed south towards I-25. Rebecca and Dhar pointed out all the liquor stores that seemed to line Academy. This started a long running joke about liquor: &#8220;But you don&#8217;t even know her!&#8221; (Liquor &#8230; &#8220;Lick Her&#8221; &#8230; get it?) When I first heard this, I had to think about it a minute. I was tempted to respond with such answers as: &#8220;Nothing wrong with strange bedfellows&#8221;, or &#8220;How you know she won&#8217;t like it?&#8221; But what little decency I had at the time kept my big mouth shut.<br />
About fifteen minutes after Stefan had turned around, he got back onto I-25, and started south. We didn&#8217;t have to go far, only about four miles until we got to the exit we needed. On the west side of I-25 was the Tank Proving Grounds. I assumed it also to be an active wargames venue, as in several of the valleys we could see, the Army had erected camouflaged tents and command centres. But there were no tanks or people in sight. Stefan was actually hoping to hear cannon shots all night.<br />
When we exited the highway, Stefan pointed out the wrong way to get to the KOA. The last time he had been there, he had turned right instead of left and drove right into an active wargame. I found this rather interesting considering the roads were lined with Tank Crossing signs. They look just like people crossing signs (yellow diamond-shaped signs with black silhouettes), but have little black tanks on them instead of people. Unfortunately, we forgot to take a picture of one of them.<br />
I started following all the instructions I could read verbatim. We turned left, and drove only about 150 feet, then turned right onto a small road that ran along the northbound lanes of I-25. We drove down that about a half mile, until the logo of the KOA sprang into view. Four quiet sighs hissed through the van as we saw the end of our 30 hour trek in view.<br />
Stefan sounded as happy as Marcel Marceau as he pulled in and prepared to get us signed in for the night. He pulled in our front of the KOA office, grabbed his wallet and darted inside. After a few minutes, Rebecca and I also got out and wandered inside to see what was taking so long.<br />
The office was combination administration depot and convenience store. The room was about 40 feet wide by 20 feet long, with a small jutting to the right of the door where souvenir t-shirts and hats were displayed. In the middle of the room was a small selection of foodstuffs, toiletries, and other necessities that are associated with camping and RV life. At the back of the room were three sets of glass doors, which at the time were papered up so you couldn&#8217;t see through them. (We found out the next morning that they were for a refrigeration cabinet, either just being installed or being upgraded.) To the left of the door was the administrative desk, which was where we found Stefan.<br />
The clerk was a young woman, probably somewhere in her 20&#8217;s. I doubted that she was the owner of the establishment, partly due to her apparent age, partly due to her countenance (which wasn&#8217;t exactly welcoming &#8211; we never saw her smile or heard her laugh). I assumed that it was partly due to the fact that it was less than half an hour until closing (which was at 20:00 in the evenings). She was an unremarkable woman, neither immediately attractive, nor offensive in appearance. She was about five foot, eight inches in height, about 180 pounds, with fairly long dirty blonde hair. She wore no visible makeup except for her cherry nail polish.<br />
Stefan was trying to figure out exactly what we needed. He had already signed up for a membership, a requirement for a stay at a KOA, and was being instructed on a special deal we had managed to stumble across that would potentially save us a lot of money. I wandered about the store as Stefan and Rebecca hovered on every word the clerk had to say. Rebecca paid particular attention to the hot tub and pool information. Unfortunately, the pool was still closed. But we still had about 20 minutes to get into the hot tub.<br />
Stefan took the camp map, which had our camping slot clearly marked, and we headed back to the van where Dhar was patiently waiting for us to return. Stefan drove carefully down the gravel roads, looking for the right slot for us to drive into. When we found it, we realized that we had come around the wrong way, and had to drive further down the path and return down the next path over. (This was because the water and electrical hook-ups were on the driver&#8217;s side of the van.)<br />
The camp itself was nothing spectacular &#8212; in fact it was the looking of the three we had seen. By &#8220;plainest&#8221;, I mean there were no trees next to the campsites, the grass still was slightly yellow from the winter snow, and what few trees there were had not yet started to grow leaves in any abundance. There were about five small gravel roads parallel to the road we drove on from I-25. Between the gravel roads were RV camping &#8220;pull-throughs&#8221;, designed to ease the process of parking and leaving. Just down from the main entrance were the bathrooms, pool and hot tubs which were all contained in the same building. Further down (east in direction) were half a dozen Kamping Kabins, a small log house that contained bunkbeds for those who want the camping experience without actually camping. (Not unlike a full-frontal lobotomy &#8230; for that feeling of death, without really dying.)<br />
Once we had parked, I took the keys from Stefan and went around to the storage compartment to hook the van up to the water and electricity. The running boards of the van behind the driver were converted into a storage compartment large enough to hold two golf bags. In the compartment we kept a small propane barbeque, a garden hose for the city water hook-up, a heavy duty 110 volt extension cable, an adapter to handle the standard 110 volt three prong outlets, and the van&#8217;s built-in 110 volt connection cable.<br />
At the bottom of the compartment is a round access hatch with a screw-in cover, used for running electrical and water supplies without having the compartment door open all the time. I ran the electrical cord out and plugged it in, then ran the water hose from the tap into the screw fitting. The tap leaked slightly, but the screw fitting on the van was watertight. I then closed the compartment and locked the door.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were about to leave when I got back in. Dhar was refusing to go into the hot tub with the rest of us, but was all for a much needed shower. I grabbed my swim trunks, towel, soap and shampoo, then hopped out of the van and went around the back. I opened the back door and removed my hiking backpack from the trunk space under the rear bench. The four of us then headed towards the showers.<br />
The air in Colorado was not as cold as Kansas had been that morning, and there was more sun to keep us warm. However, the sun was setting, and the air was cooling off with every minute. But it wasn&#8217;t uncomfortably cool. The four of us wearily trudged across the gravel roads, glancing at some of the technical marvels we were sharing the campground with. Many were enormous, some even had DirecTV dishes set up so the occupants wouldn&#8217;t miss a minute of Y &amp; R. We had chosen not to bring a TV with us (even though it was a possibility). We felt there was too much else to watch. (Though a TV and VCP would have been nice across Kansas &#8230; and Arizona &#8230; and New Mexico &#8230; Texas wasn&#8217;t so hot either &#8230;)<br />
The building was fairly simple &#8212; we entered about a third of the way along the side of the building. To our right was the pool and two hot tubs, though only one tub was open. To our left were the women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s washrooms. The washrooms were nothing special, having the necessary toilets, showers, and sinks. The three of us (men) immediately set down to getting ready. I jumped in a shower stall, put on my swim trunks, and quickly jumped into the shower to rinse myself off (common courtesy before climbing into a public water-based entertainment facility).<br />
The showers were strange, to the point of becoming annoying &#8212; they had only one knob, which unlike other single-knob showers I knew of, only turned off and on. The water temperature appeared to be fixed to slightly above what I considered to be comfortable. Yippee.<br />
Stefan was already outside by the time I was ready. I grabbed my clothes, stuffed them in my knapsack, and hauled it out to the hot tub, fenced away from the washrooms. I commented mentally that the fence looked rather odd indoors. Stefan and Rebecca were accompanied by a man, perhaps in his late 50&#8217;s or early 60&#8217;s.<br />
I had used a hot tub only a couple times before. Former neighbours of mine in Oakville had put in a hot tub in the early 1980&#8217;s, and as a child had used it a few times with the neighbour&#8217;s children, who were friends of mine. That family had kept the hot tub at over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which I found very uncomfortable and hard to get into. The hot tub at the KOA was thankfully different, its temperature was around body temperature. I climbed in with relative ease, and almost immediately, the 3,000 kilometres and 30 hours of driving vanished in the bubbles.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing what a simple device a hot tub is. Essentially a square (or round, depending on configuration) bathtub riddled with air hoses and nozzles, the hot tub is the only known device known to humanity that can suck out all the stress you have and provide sexual gratification at the same time. Though I&#8217;ve often heard those go hand-in-hand, if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun. Nevertheless, I was relieved to be bobbing in it.<br />
I was wearing a pair of swim trunks I had found left at my home almost ten years previous. They still fit me, though only barely. I hated them. I preferred to wear my bikini-style swim suit I had from my days in the swim team in high school. But as I had found out on a previous trip to Florida, most of my friends didn&#8217;t approve of me wearing them. As they put it, the swim suit didn&#8217;t &#8220;leave much to the imagination&#8221;. Not knowing how Rebecca, Dhar, or Stefan would respond, I chose not to bring it.<br />
Stefan was wearing a bikini-style swim suit, and Rebecca had her swim team swim suit, both in a matching black. I suddenly felt like an idiot for thinking I could offend either of them with my swim suit. I then reminded myself that I had also lost my physique from high school, and retracted my previous thought. Wearing such a swim suit, considering that I purposely bought it a size too small for racing purposes, it would have caused my thighs to pinch and bulge, which as you can undoubtedly imagine, is not particularly attractive.<br />
The stranger appeared to be your typical retired well-to-do office worker. He wore glasses, probably of a light to medium prescription, had white hair with a few flecks of original colour, and a wedding ring. We soon learned that his wife was to be joining him.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca had been talking with him quickly before I arrived, and I soon learned that he and his wife were on a trip much like ours, only in reverse. And not as fast. The man hailed from Detroit, and had been driving for the last few weeks through New Orleans, Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas and had just reached Colorado, at about the same time we had arrived. I guessed that the man knew where he was going, while we aimlessly bounced around the city figuring out what to do.<br />
Next thing I knew, I was shifting to the right to avoid being stepped on by the man&#8217;s wife as she climbed into the tub. I was not the only one who had been stung before by hot tubs that were too hot. It took her a moment to get in, but she too found it very relaxing. I suddenly felt very alone, the only single person in hot water. An interesting symbol, if you think about it a while.<br />
I quickly found out that the walls and floor of the tub were sculpted, with certain shapes installed containing jets to calm those aching muscles. A chair now rested under me, as did an air jet which ever so conveniently caused my trunks to fill with air. That annoying little trait made wish all the more that I had brought my Speedos with me.<br />
The five of us floated in the now-cramped tub for about another five minutes before I decided I was going to get have a shower before going back to the van. The tub, for all its relaxing power, reeked of chlorine. As a former member of the swim team, the smell of chlorine became a bit of an aphrodisiac &#8212; its prickly scent would make we swoon, almost pant in desire to swim. But after several years of abstinence, the smell was making me nauseous.<br />
I hauled myself out of the enveloping warmth, grabbed my knapsack, and headed back to the washroom. Dhar was stepping out having completed his shower. He smiled for a moment, about to ask me a question, when I asked if he could take my bag back with him while I showered. He was to ask the same question I proposed.<br />
The shower was hot, but after the hot tub, not as severely uncomfortable. I bathed in its heated glory, washing off the remaining grime collected after traversing almost three-quarters the distance across the continent. My hair felt free of the oil and dirt, my skin free of the suffocating dinginess. After ten minutes of scrubbing, I felt good enough to go to bed.<br />
I dried, changed into clean clothes, combed my hair, and jogged back to the van in the cooling air of dusk. Dhar was there reading one of the TourBooks. I stowed my toiletries on the shelf in the toilet closet, hung my towel to dry, and put my dirty clothes in a plastic bag. I then sat down and sighed in satisfaction of having arrived.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca showed up about five minutes later, and announced they were hungry. We all were. The last thing we had eaten were blue corn tortilla chips as we crossed Kansas some six hours earlier. It was decided that the hot dogs were the food of choice. I asked Stefan to grab one of the propane tanks from the trunk space (accessible through a hatch under the rear bench seat cushions) while I retrieved the barbeque from the running board compartment.<br />
Rebecca dug out the hot dogs, actually turkey dogs (Dhar refused to eat red meat, or drink milk &#8230; at least in most cases, he hadn&#8217;t quite kicked using milk in his coffee), and the buns. I set up the barbeque, got the butane lighter from the kitchen and started heating the burner. Despite its size, the barbeque heated very quickly and delivered a staggering amount of heat. It made quick work of the hot dogs. Not to mention toasting Rebecca&#8217;s buns. (Insert rude comments here.)<br />
Inside we set up the forward table, turning the driver&#8217;s and navigator&#8217;s seats to face the rear seats. In less than ten minutes, the hot dogs were ready and we all sat down to eat our first meal on the road. Rebecca, Stefan and I raised our milk in toast, Dhar his glass of Coke. Then we downed a package of twelve hot dogs. Like I said, we were hungry. By this time, it was barely 22:00.<br />
We had to close the side doors at one point, the air outside was becoming cool and Rebecca was getting cold. The van proved to be a very good protector against the cold, and also the heat. I suppose that all the insulation that Home &amp; Park cram into the van&#8217;s body tends to help.<br />
We made quick work of cleanup. Rebecca and Dhar washed the dishes, I put away the barbeque. The propane tank, however, seemed not to properly close. The tank was a simple design: the top was screwed into a regulator which had a small needle that opened the seal of the tank. But the seal wasn&#8217;t closing properly, and gas continued to leak out. I put the white cap back on and left it on the passenger side running board, in hopes it would seal overnight.<br />
The table was disassembled and the beds made. It was the first time I had truly had to set up both driver&#8217;s and navigator&#8217;s beds, and I was curious to see what it would look like. The chair were turned 90 degrees until they were back-to-back, and the rear seats unfolded. The beds turned out to be designed for people slightly shorted than Dhar and myself, but would suit our needs for the trip.<br />
We drew the blinds and locked the doors. I made an effort to brush my teeth in the sink, removing the last of the scum two days had brought on my mouth. Then I crawled into my brown sleeping bag, prepared to catch up on a day&#8217;s worth of sleep. I quickly noticed two things: there was a hole in my sleeping bag liner, and Dhar snored.<br />
I&#8217;ve always been jealous of people who can fall asleep quickly. I normally take between 15 and 30 minutes to fall asleep, and as much as two hours if I&#8217;m anxious about something. Dhar fell asleep in under five minutes, at least that was how long it took him to start snoring. Not that snoring bothered me too much &#8212; both my parents snored and ground their teeth. Even my first cat snored, and that was louder than both my parents! I just shook my head and prepared to pass out.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Alive and well, we&#8217;re now about to settle in for the night. It took us too long to find the stupid KOA, but we&#8217;re all set now. Probably lost a propane tank. Met some folks taking a similar trip as us, but only in reverse.Kansas was hideously boring.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke at a little after 08:00 that morning. I wasn&#8217;t the slightest but groggy, my usual waking state &#8212; I was excited. The day had finally come. I wandered out of my room. Dhar&#8217;s (rather, my sister&#8217;s) door was open, and he wasn&#8217;t anywhere to be seen. The bed didn&#8217;t even look slept in &#8212; either he stayed up all night, or was much neater than me (which, with all honest, can&#8217;t be all that difficult). Little did I know at the time that Dhar didn&#8217;t require a lot of sleep. I quickly jumped in and out of the shower and did all the neat and tidy things I could to make myself look presentable for the first day. Exactly why I did this I&#8217;m not too entirely sure &#8212; Stefan and Rebecca knew who I was, and what I was capable of. I guess it was mostly for Dhar&#8217;s sake, I didn&#8217;t want to frighten him &#8230; at least until we were out of the country.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan were still sleeping at the time, so I went outside as quietly as I could (not too easily done, the front door creaks quite loudly). I quickly found Dhar, having what appeared to be a deeply involving automotive discussion with my father. This didn&#8217;t particularly surprise me since my father had previously owned a Ford Probe as well, but had given it up due to a bad back &#8212; or to be more specific, the bad back the Probe gave him. As it turned out, Dhar had quickly learned as much about the van as I knew, which I knew would come in handy in the event that I forgot about something important. And when it comes to cars, I usually tend to forget everything.<br />
My father had already gone to the trouble of draining the fresh water tanks, an experience that told us how slow the tank emptied, and refilled it with clean water. He did this twice to make sure that the tank was free of Javex prior to our departure. (There&#8217;s nothing like the taste of bleach-contaminated water &#8230; and after that you&#8217;ll can taste nothing.) The water hose was coiled and put away along with the electrical cable in the running board storage compartment.<br />
A moment later, Stefan bounded out of the front door. Either someone had awaken him and Rebecca (the latter of which was not nearly as fast moving in the morning as the rest of us), or like Dhar and myself, were too anxious to sleep any longer. Dhar took this opportunity to make use of the shower, before starting what would be a 30 hour drive to Colorado.<br />
Our trip was ambitious (bordering on insanity, at least according to some of our friends and family), but not as ambitious as it had once been. In less than two weeks, we planned to visit Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Albuquerque, Roswell, San Antonio, Houston, New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, and Cleveland. Originally we had also planned to visit Death Valley, Los Angeles and San Diego. However, when our time became more and more constrained, and we realized just how large a trip we were looking at, we cut California right out of the picture. As it turned out, we didn&#8217;t even get to see all that we had planned (namely the entire state of Texas).<br />
At this time, I would like to provide some free advertisement for the Canadian Automobile Association (and its American counterpart). Planning a trip like this would have been a complete nightmare if it were not for the efforts of the CAA. Not to mention all the freebies that come with membership&#8230;<br />
A few years ago, my parents bought my sister and I memberships with the CAA. This was due mostly to both of us doing a great deal of driving to and from our beautiful national capital (Ottawa), sometimes in less than ideal weather. While it&#8217;s true that a CAA membership (or suitable equivalent) isn&#8217;t used very often, the times that you need it most are the ones you&#8217;re glad you have it. This trip was just one of those occasions.<br />
On a suggestion from my mother (suggestions being 50% of motherly duties, the remainder made of nagging, scolding, and guilt-tripping), I went to the Hamilton Automobile Club (the local branch of the CAA), and informed them of the trip. From the destinations that had become our route, the CAA created a &#8220;TripTik&#8221;, which is a city-by-city, highway-by-highway map of your journey. For the Interstate-uninitiated, this can be a Godsend, keeping you on the right track whilst traveling through the United States (though we realized that you&#8217;re better off if you&#8217;ve got a map book that covers Interstates). I also acquired a rather large collection of travel books for all the states that we would either be visiting or passing through. Most of these books got extensive use.<br />
And the membership is compatible with the AAA (the American Automobile Association), in the event you need roadside assistance somewhere in the United States &#8230; providing of course that you have a method of contacting them (there&#8217;s never a pay phone in the middle of the Mojave Desert when you need one). We never needed that kind of coverage, but the knowledge that we had access to it was enough to let us drive in peace and not worry about a major problem. Being a member also means less problems with health &#8212; for a mere $20, I also bought extra health coverage in America just in case I fell ill. Again, it wasn&#8217;t needed, but without it I would have had to pay a fortune in medical costs (getting sick in the States is not good for your health, bodily and financially).<br />
So for anyone planning an extensive trip in the United States, I strongly recommend getting a CAA membership (or AAA, if you happen to live in the U.S.). You never know when problems will come, and Murphy&#8217;s Law always says you&#8217;ll get them at the most inopportune time. This means that you&#8217;ll lose all your fluids in the middle of the desert. Luckily, we didn&#8217;t &#8212; but we were covered in case Murphy had stowed along for the ride (which was a bit doubtful, when you considered all the crap we brought along).<br />
Most people (except the good souls at the CAA) who I mentioned the trip to thought we were insane. Over 10,000 kilometres in less than two weeks was not what most people would consider a vacation. I, for one, cannot stand sitting in the sun for more than a day without my brain decalcifying from having nothing to do. The thought of visiting so many places seemed like a dream come true to me, I only wished that we had more time so that we could have included California in the itinerary.<br />
And besides, the purpose of the whole fling was as a road trip. All road trips are characterized by one thing: piling into a vehicle and driving a long distance. Until our &#8220;Road Trip From Hell&#8221;, I hadn&#8217;t been on a trip that exceeded six hundred kilometres in distance. I was embarking on a discovery tour, going places I had only seen in movies and TV, or read about in magazines and books. I would be doing things that a year previous I never even imagined. And the whole time I would enjoy myself &#8230; or at least that was the plan.<br />
But before we could pack ourselves into the van, my parents (specifically my mother, performing one of her lesser, but still necessary, motherly duties) turned into the kind of sappy parents you see parodies of in National Lampoon. The dreaded camera was out. We arranged ourselves like a police line up and politely grinned as my mother decided that she would take the first picture of the trip. (I didn&#8217;t bother to tell her that Dhar had already taken a picture the night before during the tour, to prove the size of the inside of the van.)<br />
As a last step before final boarding was called, I got the spare set of keys from the hall drawer. In case something befell the set of keys the current driver carried, my father suggested (in other words, decided) that we should bring spares. The safety of those keys were naturally entrusted to the most responsible person in the group. Stefan and Dhar looked a little taken aback when I handed the huge plastic keyring to Rebecca.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960421.10</strong><br />
<em>Day 1</em><br />
We&#8217;re ready to hit the road. Everyone showed up early last night, kinda caught me off guard. But we&#8217;re now ready to hit the road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus we piled into the van and strapped ourselves in for the longest drive we would have for the duration of the trip. Partly to appease my father, and to let the others get accustomed to the van &#8212; though mostly due to pride &#8212; I took the first shift of driving. I carefully nudged the van forward, tooted the horn (which if you ask me, is not nearly loud enough), rounded the corner and didn&#8217;t look back.<br />
At least until I got to Maplegrove Village, where my branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was located. I needed to make a quick transaction to prevent my cheques from bouncing. Less than five minutes later, we headed up Ford Drive to join with Highway 403. From there to the Trafalgar Road bypass, which in turn would take us to Highway 401. Less than a half hour from leaving home, I set the cruise control for 100 km/h, Dhar set the CD player, and we headed for Windsor, which would eventually take us to Detroit &#8212; our gateway to the United States.<br />
The stretch of highways from Oakville to Highway 8 I had driven many times, as that was the route I took to get to the University of Waterloo, where I had been studying English Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Those stretches took about half an hour to cover. Once we past that, I commented that I was traveling a portion of the 401 that I had never seen before. Stefan was rather startled by this revelation, I guess he believed that I had gone this way several times.<br />
Suddenly I realized that only Stefan had ventured to the Midwest previously. Dhar, Rebecca and myself were all proverbial virgins at that portion of the continent. I was no stranger to the West, my relatives live in Saskatchewan. However, that had been as far west as I had ever traveled with good memory. My mother claims to this day that I went to British Columbia as a wee babe to visit my mother&#8217;s Godmother, but my memory as a wee babe does not recall such a venture (although, oddly enough, it does include an incident of sitting down while wearing soiled diapers). As such, this trip would be my first real experience of the West.<br />
For the next two hours or so we continued along the 401, while forming what would eventually become our regular pastime &#8212; finding out more about each other. I learned a great many things not only of Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar, but also of myself. They were things I had known unconsciously, but only through such conversation did the truth come to the surface &#8230; but not necessarily to light.<br />
Less than an hour from the border, we stopped at what would become our last taste of Canada for almost two weeks: a batch of Tim Horton&#8217;s Timbits (donut holes to the uneducated). It was a fortuitous stop in more than one way, as I also needed to relieve a filled bladder. Once again, I was confronted with an odd insecurity I, and many other males have &#8212; an inability to use a urinal when other men are present.<br />
It&#8217;s rather annoying: you walk into the Men&#8217;s Room, stand in front of the urinal, unzip the front of your pants, and stand uncomfortably because for some reason none of the muscles in your groin care to cooperate and allow you to urinate. What causes it I have no idea. At one time I used to think it was a result of being insecure about my genitals. After several years of university, endless discussions of sex, and more &#8220;interesting&#8221; situations I care to recall, I choose to discount that theory &#8230; at least for myself. Besides, I&#8217;ve found that with practice the problem goes away.<br />
At any rate, this problem was quickly overcome with the use of one of the toilet stalls. I may have received a few odd looks, but less pressure at the waistline allows me the luxury to not care and proceed with my life.<br />
Within minutes, we piled back into the van and resumed our heading westward. An hour later, we entered Windsor, and caught our first glimpse of the Ambassador Bridge, peeking above the tops of the low-set skyline. Our time in Canada was drawing to a close. On an earlier suggestion from Stefan, we immediately began to look for Canadian Customs, so we could register our more expensive items on board. This was for two reasons: in the event something got stolen, or in case Customs believed that we were trying to smuggle something back.<br />
Before I knew it, I (still the current driver) had accidentally overshot the entrance to the Customs facility. Unfortunately, I had never entered into the United States through the Windsor gateway, I had always gone through either Niagara or Fort Erie. I knew where the Customs facilities were there. We quickly ducked into the area normally reserved for trucks going to the U.S. Rebecca and Stefan went into the office to find out how we would get back to the Customs building. The roads around the facility were all one-way roads, so we were justifiably confused.<br />
The instructions they returned with were cryptic at best (not unexpected from Canadian Customs officials). We had to ask someone else. This meant we had to cross through the toll access point. When we got to the booth, we asked the attendant what we had to do. She told us to go up the road a little, just pass the median, pull a U-turn and head back towards the Canadian Customs booths just below us. There we could find out what to do. We received a receipt in the event we got hopelessly lost and ended up back at the toll booths again.<br />
Once I had us pointed back in Canada again, we pulled up to the Canadian Customs booths. In less than three seconds we completely managed to confound the clerk, trying to explain to him what had just happened (it&#8217;s always fun to play &#8220;Stump the Chump&#8221;). But in a moment he understood and pointed us in the right direction to the Customs building. He also pointed out the route we would later take to get back to the bridge and avoid the toll booths. The man scribbled on a yellow piece of paper and handed it to us, not mentioning what it was for, then waved us on.<br />
We drove across a large roadway into the Customs complex, and found a pull-through parking slot. We immediately noticed the plethora of Government employees not doing anything (in other words, a typical Government installation). We were sadly not surprised at this, disappointed that our tax dollars were feeding apathy.<br />
We immediately set down to finding every last serial number of an expensive item we had. Fortunately, Home &amp; Park (who built the Behemoth) had already created a list of all the van&#8217;s expensive items. Dhar&#8217;s camera, lens and flash; my camera, lens and flash; the CD player; and Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s camera were recorded onto a piece of paper. Then Dhar and I wandered over to the main Customs building for approval.<br />
We expected a large lineup &#8212; it was a Government office, after all. Border crossings, although nicely informal, were often slow mainly due to volume. This was the first time I had ever gone through the Customs office before leaving the country, but I expected no difference in efficiency.<br />
Upon entering the doors, Dhar and I immediately noticed several people sitting down, a few people at kiosks, and a bunch of Government employees milling around doing nothing (different group of public employees, same work ethic). We paused a moment, and ventured to stand in line. Almost immediately, a woman behind the counter moved away from her discussion and motioned us to go to her. We informed her we only wanted to register the items we were taking over with us. She in turn asked if we had the serial numbers available. I produced the sheet that came with the van and the one we created, mentioning that some items didn&#8217;t have serial numbers. Even before I had finished speaking, the two sheets were stamped and the woman had walked away. Dhar and I looked at each other in surprise, shrugged our shoulders in disbelief, and headed back towards the doors. It was hard to say what bothered me more: the fact that she really seem to care about what she was doing, or that we were only in the building for 30 seconds.<br />
On the way back to the van, Dhar and I encountered two more Customs agents, who took the mysterious little piece of yellow paper from me, looked at it, then waved us on. Typically cryptic government shenanigans. We were probably passing notes between all the clerks. Now hopelessly confused, Dhar and I returned to a locked van (and me without my keys). Stefan unlocked the door, Dhar and I climbed in, and we prepared to finally leave Canada behind us.<br />
A minute later we had crossed the political border and were stuck in a traffic jam on the down side of the bridge. And we were in the slow lane. I had not yet learned all the nuances of the van, and wasn&#8217;t in the mood for trying to run into the next lane. We were in no hurry, so we decided to critique the City of Detroit instead.<br />
We were amazed at the decay we could see. Buildings crumbling, garbage everywhere, soot and grime seemed to cover everything. Even the air seemed dirtier than just across the river. Detroit seemed a large unwieldy mess of concrete, glass, and steel. It&#8217;s amazing how much culture shock one can receive merely by traveling less than one kilometre, the distance from Canada to the U.S.<br />
A half hour after crossing the bridge, we finally arrived at the U.S. Customs booth. It was time for 20 Questions. &#8220;Where ya goin&#8217;? Fer how long? Are ya takin&#8217; any fruit or vegetables? Where ya from? Is ev&#8217;one Canadian? Lessee yer birth certificates. You in back, lessee? Anythin&#8217; to declare? Okay, have a good time.&#8221; I almost expected to hear a &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; as we passed out of earshot.<br />
We breathed a sigh of relief, even if only psychologically, as we were now free to roam the vast expanses of America without any fear of something hanging over our heads. Dhar quickly dug out the TripTik again, and began deciphering the route to get out of Detroit and onto I-94. I didn&#8217;t quite catch the instructions completely, so Stefan attempted to clarify. It was only when the most responsible person of the trip got a hold of the TripTik did we finally get moving. When in doubt, ask a woman.<br />
Dhar started drooling less than five minutes into the States. We made the mistake of taking a route through the middle of the Motor City, the headquarters of the Ford Motor Corporation. Detroit was Dhar&#8217;s Mecca, and took every opportunity to find Ford billboards, and if he was lucky, an automotive plant. I waited with baited breath for the question: &#8220;Can we go on a Ford tour?&#8221;. As we exited Detroit into its suburbs, Dhar spotted Ford&#8217;s Special Vehicle Labs. It was there such geniuses as Shelby created some of the most well-known American sports cars in existence. It was there that Dhar&#8217;s Probe was given birth on a drawing board. He sighed as we passed westward.<br />
Outside of Detroit we got sidetracked. Actually, sidetracked isn&#8217;t the right word. We got lost. Ann Arbor creates a divide in I-94, causing the main route to go just south of the city, and a smaller state highway to go north of the city. At this point, none of us were completely comfortable with U.S. highways, and we weren&#8217;t ready for the split. In a panic of which route to take, we took the north route onto State Highway 23, away from I-94. At first we thought we were still on I-94. But when we realized that the red, white and blue I-94 highway markers were replaced with a white shield bearing the number &#8217;23&#8217;, we panicked. But only for a moment or two.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t help feel like morons for getting lost in America so quickly. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, we still had two weeks to find our way around. In only a matter of moments, someone figured out that Highway 23 was nothing more than a bypass of the city, and wasn&#8217;t going to get us hopelessly lost. We continued to follow the 23 around until we saw signs that guided us back to I-94.<br />
Road trips, by their very nature, tend to be performed by the seat-of-the-pants &#8230; in other words, unplanned. Ours was intended to be the exception &#8212; we had done a good deal of the ground work in advance. Or at least that was the impression I had given myself. Prior to leaving, we had established a long line of places we wanted to go and roads we had to travel. Due to our time constraints, we also knew that there wasn&#8217;t too much room for leeway. But as one can inevitably expect, plans change. Ours started to.<br />
Stefan, unbeknownst to me (and the others, much to our chagrin), wanted to go places we had never even discussed. First off, I&#8217;ll state for the record that Stefan is a nature nut. Now I&#8217;m not holding that against him &#8212; I am too, though not quite to the extent of Stefan &#8230; or Rebecca, for that matter &#8212; but he wanted more nature than we planned for.<br />
Colorado is a state full of natural wonders, most of which spring up due to two things: the geology and the general remoteness of certain parts of the state. The end result is an abundance of parks &#8230; a good deal of which Stefan wanted to visit. Under different circumstances, I might have gone along with the deal. Maybe if we had planned not to go to places like Las Vegas and New Orleans, perhaps I would have been more supportive. But I was in an explorative mood, and I wanted to see all that I could see, and an endless number of trees and mountains wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to explore.<br />
Thus we began to argue &#8230; okay, maybe argue isn&#8217;t the correct term &#8230; discuss loudly where we going. I quickly realized, with some relief, that I wasn&#8217;t alone. Rebecca and Dhar both wanted to see Vegas and at least one of the other places we had planned. Stefan was pushing for at least four days in Colorado. I knew full well that any more than two would result in having to axe something from the trip. (As it turns out, we had to axe the entire state of Texas, but that was for different reasons.)<br />
The discussion lasted for roughly fifteen minutes when the most responsible member of the group called an end because it was giving her a headache. We resolved to continue the discussion in Colorado Springs when we were settled in.<br />
We weren&#8217;t even out of Michigan.<br />
The roadside billboards became, for a while, a focus of some fascination for us. In Canada, the public has prevented the plethora of eyesores that American urban highways are noted for. The diversity of the ads, and the names of the products they advertise provided us with a great deal of entertainment, especially Dhar.<br />
Earlier that morning, I learned of Dhar&#8217;s habitual rhymes: &#8220;Awesome Possum&#8221;, &#8220;Starvin&#8217; Marvin&#8221;, &#8220;Gotta Stop Lollipop&#8221;, and so forth. Cute, but endlessly annoying if left unchecked for a few days. (Not to mention the fact that it was a habit I was afraid I would adopt over the course of the trip.) Luckily, for me, Dhar either grew tired of the habit, or he didn&#8217;t use it very often in the first place. Either way, the rhymes were infrequent.<br />
So what does Dhar&#8217;s habitual rhyming have to do with billboards? Shortly before we entered Lansing, Dhar nearly leapt out of his seat. For a moment he was stammering about something he had seen, and we couldn&#8217;t understand him. When asked to repeat his statement, we learned that we had just passed a billboard advertising, and I swear I&#8217;m not making this up, a store called Starvin&#8217; Marvin. Dhar swore then and there that he would have a picture of a Starvin&#8217; Marvin store before the trip was over.<br />
I continued to drive until we arrived in Lansing, Michigan. By that point I had been driving for about six hours, and was feeling tired. This was my first introduction to Interstate Rest Areas. This was part of Dwight Eisenhower&#8217;s plans for a great American highway system. About every 20 miles or so outside of urban areas one can find small parking lots, usually with toilets, at the side of the Interstate. These quickly became havens for us, where we stopped to use the bathrooms, cook our dinners, or catch enough sleep to keep driving. I used the opportunity to call home.<br />
Now don&#8217;t go callin&#8217; me a momma&#8217;s boy &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t homesick, just absent-minded. I had forgotten two very important things: addresses to mail postcards, and my CAA health insurance number. The latter I could do without until a major crisis developed, but the addresses I would need much sooner.<br />
AT&amp;T (or whoever ran the local payphones) has a particularly annoying collect call system. I had to actually say into the phone &#8220;Collect Call&#8221; to place the call. Even though I had to key in the number, I had to vocalize what I wanted. Some programmer could&#8217;ve made everyone&#8217;s life a lot easier but just having someone press &#8216;1&#8217; or &#8216;2&#8217;, and so forth. Humanity tries to make life too easy, and ends up making it more complicated.<br />
My mother immediately panicked (a typically mother-like thing to do), not expecting to hear from me so soon. I reassured her that the only reason I was calling was to get the information I had left behind. A moment later I had the addresses safely jotted down in my organizer, but the health insurance was nowhere to be found. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned about this, but decided to make another check of my stuff to make sure I didn&#8217;t actually manage to pack it when I wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
We&#8217;re well into the States now, despite an unintentional detour. I got Scott&#8217;s, Tara&#8217;s, Chris&#8217; and Kathryn&#8217;s addresses &#8211; I should be okay from here. It&#8217;s 4:37 now, and we still have some 18 hours until we get to our final destination.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Stefan volunteered for the next shift of driving, and I retired to the couch in the rear to get some sleep. We had plans to drive in a six hour rotation, so that we could easily drive through the night and arrive in Colorado Springs as soon as possible. Thus it made sense for me to get some sleep so we wouldn&#8217;t have any problems with me driving come morning.<br />
However, I had always had problems sleeping in cars, so I doubted heavily that I would be able to sleep at all while we were on the road. Nevertheless, I went to the back, stretched myself out on the bench, buckled myself in so I wouldn&#8217;t fall off, and tried to get a couple hours of sleep. I closed my eyes and began a mental exercise to try and get myself to sleep. I&#8217;m normally a heavy sleeper, but it takes a long time for me to get to a heavy sleeping state. Over the years I developed a mental exercise which causes me to reflect sleepiness back into my mind, thus amplifying the effect. But it wasn&#8217;t working in the van.<br />
Next thing I knew, we were exiting I-94 somewhere just inside the Indiana border. I had no idea how long I had been asleep, but I guessed at no more than an hour. It was time for our first fill-up of American gasoline, and our first shot at American gas-bar convenience stores. I quickly dug out my personal organizer, which was doubling as our travel expenses log. I jotted down the distance we covered on the tank of gas, and prepared to take the rest of the information regarding refill volume and price. But in the meantime I opted for disappearing into the store and getting something to eat.<br />
Never before had I seen a Subway in a gas station &#8230; a normal gas station. This wasn&#8217;t one of those mega-stations that started appearing along Highway 401 in Ontario, but an average sized gas station one would expect to see in any town or city. But inside was a Subway sandwich bar, complete with bread bakers. Only the seats and tables were missing. As near as I can figure, the only reason for such things was that it was next to an Interstate.<br />
But I was hungry, and not about to debate the reasoning for placing the Subway where it was. I quickly found out that the prices in the States (or at least along the Interstate) were almost identical to those in Canada, not counting the conversion. In other words, the American Subway was more expensive than the one just off-campus that I used to go to on an infrequent basis. Thus I opted for the cheapest sub they had available that I liked &#8212; the Subway Club.<br />
The toppings were all standard: lettuce, olives, hot peppers, green peppers, onions, pickles. But instead of normal mustard (which is French&#8217;s in Canada, if I&#8217;m not mistaken), it was Dijon mustard. And instead of Italian dressing (which is &#8220;sub sauce&#8221; in Canada), I had virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. Added an interesting zing to the sub, but overall didn&#8217;t change the flavour much.<br />
I quickly discovered that I wasn&#8217;t as hungry as I thought I was, and ate only half the sub. I tossed the rest in the fridge for later. Dhar and Rebecca promptly decided they were going to have dinner. Dhar vacated the navigator&#8217;s position, and I took over. It was about this time that we entered the Fort Wayne area, which in other words meant that it was time for a navigator to start giving directions.<br />
Fort Wayne was one of the easier places for us to travel through &#8212; we never left the highway we were on. Despite the fact we ran through Fort Wayne at around 18:00, we didn&#8217;t encounter any traffic. Living near Toronto brings you a certain level of awareness of time. You know that there are several hours in the day that you simply don&#8217;t drive on the highways because you hit traffic so nasty you want to pull all you hair out. For example, rush hour in Toronto lasts from about 15:30 to nearly 18:30. But in Fort Wayne, the traffic never came &#8230; that was when I remembered that it was still Sunday.<br />
It&#8217;s often amazing how little meaning days of the week have when you go on a vacation. You just keep track of the actual dates themselves &#8212; you know you have to be in city X by the 23rd, and in canyon Y by the 25th. I was amazed at how quickly I forgot what the day was.<br />
Shortly after Dhar and Rebecca finished eating, Dhar lay down to get some sleep. He had volunteered for the late night shift, and wanted to be awake for it. I tried to convince myself that I would also need more sleep later on, since I would be driving again come the morning. But I knew that would be difficult, since I was so excited to finally be on another trip, the first one in five years.<br />
Stefan drove for the next four or five hours without any incident. It was an uneventful portion of the trip, we found new ways to keep ourselves interested. Several times I thought about opening my Linguistics text I had brought, so I could get some reading done. But every time I thought about it, the thought of doing school work while on a vacation seemed appallingly trite. Thus it remained packed in one of the upper compartments where I promised to forget about it for at least a week.<br />
My duties as navigator were required when we entered Indianapolis, shortly after nightfall. Here we moved up a highway, from I-69 to I-70. But to do so, we had to skirt around the edge of the city on the I-465. The Americans are rather interesting about how they design their highways &#8212; they seem to regularly build rings around their cities so travelers only need enter the city if they need do, unlike cities such as Toronto where you get mired in traffic if you pick your time poorly.<br />
Scarcely a half hour later, we were watching Indianapolis fade away into the greyness behind us. Already the sky was darkening as clouds began to form above us. It was a foreshadow of what we would receive later on that evening.<br />
A few hours later we arrived in St. Louis. It was dark and foggy, but even through the glare of the city lights, we could see the famous Gateway Arch off in the distance. I woke Dhar and Rebecca to view the sight, though I must admit, I seemed to be the only one interested in it. Another half hour, and we were exiting the St. Louis city limits, and re-entering the enveloping darkness of the Interstate.<br />
By this time, Stefan&#8217;s stint behind the wheel had ended, and he wanted to relax a while. Driving the van wasn&#8217;t at all tiring under normal circumstances, but when you had to fight the wind to keep the van in the lane you quickly got worn down. Fortunately, the wind had started to die down with the coming of night, but the damage had already been done and Stefan had to take a break for a few hours.<br />
Rebecca was the next victim in line. We pulled off the highway, down an off-ramp, crossed the road and got on the on-ramp, stopping just as we got onto it. Quickly, Stefan jumped out the door as Rebecca slid between the driver and navigator&#8217;s chairs and took her seat. The doors behind me opened and shut, there was a hasty clicking of belt buckles, and the van started back onto the Interstate.<br />
Prelude to disaster: Dhar and I used the same mirror settings, with the odd minor adjustment. Taking over from Stefan usually meant another larger adjustment to compensate for Stefan&#8217;s height. Under the best of conditions, Rebecca never would&#8217;ve been able to see with Stefan&#8217;s mirror settings. We were unknowingly about to throw Rebecca into conditions so bad they made me cringe. And we forgot to change the mirrors.<br />
After only a few minutes of driving, we realized our first major mistake &#8212; letting Rebecca drive in the dark. It&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s a bad driver (I&#8217;d never actually been in a car when she was driving), it&#8217;s that Rebecca wasn&#8217;t ready for the task. Back home in Kingston, Rebecca usually only drove about town during the day in her Dodge Laser (for those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kingston is a very peaceful city on the south side of Ontario, about half-way between Toronto and the Quebec border). We had put her behind the wheel of a three tonne, eight foot three inch high, 19 foot long, blind spot laden behemoth &#8230; in the middle of the night. Rebecca was justifiably worried.<br />
But we made efforts to try and adjust the mirrors so she could make it a couple hours, gain some experience, and let Dhar rest up before his early morning shift. But as Murphy&#8217;s Law always states: if anything is already wrong, it can only get worse.<br />
It began to rain.<br />
Heavily.<br />
I almost expected to see an off-ramp sign for Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Most of the work was on my family&#8217;s newly-purchased RoadTrek 190 Versatile, a Dodge Ram van converted into a small motorhome. It was the result of my aunt&#8217;s interest in the RoadTrek company, and my father&#8217;s interest in toys. I doubt my family would have been so quick in purchasing the RoadTrek (which would become to be known as &#8216;The Behemoth&#8217;) if this trip had never been thought of.<br />
When the trip had first been planned, we looked into renting a car or minivan to support us for our trip. But the costs were too high &#8212; we would be adding almost $200 per person before adding the cost of gasoline. The cost was so prohibitive, I volunteered my 1991 Plymouth Acclaim to ferry us about the United States. Not nearly as comfortable as a minivan, but certainly a lot cheaper than renting.<br />
Somewhere along the line, my parents found out about the trip (sometimes I think they&#8217;re telepathic &#8230; either that or I&#8217;m becoming more forgetful with age). Not that I was trying to keep the trip a secret &#8212; they had to eventually find out. My father, in one of what I have come to call his &#8220;moods&#8221; decided that a RoadTrek would be a good idea to take on such a trip. Seeing the possibilities (not the least of which was a lower cost for accommodation, and more space for stretching out), I chose not to argue.<br />
At the time, my family owned a 37&#8242; trawler, moored in Penetanguishene, just off Georgian Bay. But the upkeep on the boat, the costs required to maintain it, and the extremely short amount of time we could use it each year caused problems. The fact that only my father was experienced in driving the ship meant that neither my sister nor I could take it out without the presence of dear old dad. Not to mention the fact that a VHF license was required in the event we needed to use the radio. To make a long story short, my parents had already decided to sell the boat.<br />
So why not just sell the boat and leave it at that? Well, my parents (bless &#8217;em both) are registered members of CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons. My father has been unofficially retired since about 1990, when his employer decided to force him to quit. He played around with a few other jobs, but I think it was mostly to prevent boredom. But in the past couple of years, dad calmed down and accepted the fact that he could do whatever he wanted.<br />
Selling the boat left us without a form of recreation outside the house. My parents, in quasi-retirement (my mother continues to do bookkeeping for a few local companies, and my father is too stubborn to relax), needed such a medium for their extra time when they weren&#8217;t doing something. The loss of the boat would mean that they would have no way of seeing the countryside without driving. And driving the car had its limits since you either had to return home at the end of the day, or spend a great deal of money going to hotels and restaurants.<br />
Enter RoadTrek: take your home with you. Although my mother liked the idea, the thought of driving everywhere was none too appealing for her. She never consciously would admit to it, but her attitude during the discussions of what to do continually said: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want any part in this&#8221;. But in the end my father, my sister and I all agreed that buying the van was a good idea. My mother continued to smile and nod quietly.<br />
The van was picked up on a Thursday (three days from departure) from the dealer in Kitchener, where the dealer promptly gave my father and I a detailed breakdown on the operation of the vehicle. This involved the use of the liquid propane system; the black water, grey water, and fresh water tanks; the storage spaces; the hook-ups (water and electricity); the furnace; the hot water heater; air conditioner; sink; fridge; shower; toilet; and a few specifics about the underlying vehicle. This took almost three hours.<br />
On the morning of the 19th of April, plans were made to get all my gear ready to go, get a barbeque, garbage pail, dishes, food, money, tools, and a few other odds and ends for the van. My father and I found a barbeque at the local Wal-mart, despite some confusion with the pricing and stocking of the materials. We also bought an oil filter so we could make an oil change prior to departure.<br />
A garbage pail that would suit the deep blue interior of the van was not to be found anywhere. As such, I was directed to find a pail in the States. (This was a task uncompleted since not once did I see a waste bin for a van, let alone a deep blue one.) Money was also an uncompleted task, since I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to the bank to withdraw $100 in American funds.<br />
On the morning of the 20th, I received my first real trial by fire, by taking the van up to my Aunt Ruth&#8217;s in Caledon East, just north of Toronto. The trip opened my eyes to just how sensitive the van was to winds, and how poorly it drove when it was unloaded. The van&#8217;s height, eight feet three inches, created an excellent wall that the wind could push very easily. This problem was overcome by loading material into the van, and by increasing the air pressure in the tires.<br />
Upon returning home, it rained. This was a problem because my father had intentions of changing the oil before the next day, departure day. When the rain stopped, he donned his coveralls, and pulled himself under the van to change the oil and attempt to lubricate the joints. Next we filled the fresh water tank to test it for ourselves. It was then we found a label in the storage compartment that told us to clean the tank before use.<br />
The Javex bottle was mysteriously waiting for me at the back door when I arrived to retrieve it, a complete coincidence. The tank was filled partly with bleach, and the rest with water. We then plugged the van into the house to charge the main battery, and set the fridge to cool overnight. The next morning we would flush the tanks and refill them with fresh water for the trip.<br />
That night, I packed and gathered together all the things I thought I was going to need for the trip: CD player (which I had bought earlier that day to replace my old one which seemed to have given up the will to spin), CDs (with specific titles suggested by Stefan and Rebecca), clothes, a couple hats, shoes, sandals, two books, and my journal and log book. At around midnight, I decided to check email.<br />
Following a pattern that had been ongoing for months, I had more messages from Rebecca and Stefan. I went over a few older ones to make sure I hadn&#8217;t forgotten something, and made note of a few other things mentioned in the newer messages. From everything I had read, I assumed that I would see them and Dhar at around noon the next day. No sooner than had I logged off, the doorbell sounded.<br />
(Okay, so it isn&#8217;t a doorbell, it&#8217;s another toy. The doorbell is musical, the result of my father doing strange things. It&#8217;s unique &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen, or heard, anything else like it, but after 15 years of use it&#8217;s no longer anything really fun. And it&#8217;s not something you want to hear at a quarter after midnight.)<br />
Almost as soon as I heard it, I knew who it was. None of my friends in Oakville would come by after 20:00 without checking with me much earlier. It could only have been Dhar, Stefan and Rebecca. I was right.<br />
I was shocked.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t ready.<br />
They were.<br />
When I opened the door to greet them, I suddenly realized that my parents had already enabled the security system, it started beeping immediately. A quick jump at the controls avoided a rather loud awaking for my father, who was already in bed.<br />
Suffice to say, I apologized for not being able to leave that night, and offered them a bed and a shower in the morning. Both Dhar and Stefan were a little agitated at not leaving, but sleep sounded good to both of them (they both had written exams earlier that day). Rebecca didn&#8217;t seem to really care one way or the other. But before turning in for the night, I offered a tour of what would become our mobile accommodations.<br />
Like any normal van, the RoadTrek has five doors: the driver&#8217;s door, the &#8220;shotgun&#8221; (or in our case, the navigator) door, a pair of doors behind the navigator, and a large door at the rear. Inside, RoadTrek put together a very nice, comfortable place to live for two weeks. The driver and navigator&#8217;s chairs are both orthopedic, with lumbar support controls. These chairs are meant to be used for long hauls, like our long stints behind the wheel. The chairs were fitted with both a front / back slide, and a swivel so they could turn 180 degrees and face backwards. This was necessary in part because when locked in a 90 degree position, these chairs formed part of the forward bunks.<br />
Behind the driver and navigator are two large seats. Unlike the front seats, these are built not to turn, slide or even tilt back. Instead, these chairs are disassembled to form the rest of the forward bunks. The seat portion of the chairs pulls out. The back slides up, and then is placed where the seat portion used to be, forming a longer pad. When the front seats are rotated 90 degrees, they form a reasonably comfortable bunk, although people over five foot five inches might find it a bit short.<br />
Between the two chairs is a lowered floor. Home &amp; Park (the builders of the RoadTrek vans) cut out an 18 inch by eight foot chunk out of the floor, and lowered it about four inches. This lowering, with the addition of the raised roof, provided me with exactly enough clearance to walk around without having to duck my head. Stefan wasn&#8217;t so lucky. At the front of this lowered section, between the two rear seats, is a hole to allow the setting of a table into the floor.<br />
Towards the back of the lowered floor is the kitchen / washroom area. On the driver&#8217;s side of the van is the kitchen: a sink, two burner gas stove, and a microwave oven (usable only when the van is connected to a 110 volt electrical system). Above the stove is a fan with a light to funnel away smells and waste gases from the burners. Above and below the sink are several cabinets for storing dishes and food. (The van has a great deal of storage space &#8212; and we used all of it.)<br />
Across from the sink, on the navigator&#8217;s side, is the toilet. This is a manual flush system, requiring the user to step on a pedal to flush the toilet. The toilet was contained in a two by six foot cabinet, with doors that swung out to create a barrier across the van for privacy. Also in the cabinet was the shower curtain and shower head. None of these were ever used during our trip, we made use of the showers at the KOAs we stayed at. In the middle of the ceiling of the kitchen area was ceiling fan and skylight. The fan had a thermostat which could be set with a dial to keep the fan going until the interior was a comfortable temperature.<br />
Behind the kitchen at the back of the van was the main bunk. Normally, it appeared as an L-shaped couch. In front of the couch in the floor was hole for another table, which we rarely set up. When unfolded, the couch became a double bed, just wide enough to fit most people stretched out. Just below the couch was the furnace for those cold mornings, and above it the air-conditioner for those hot nights. Like the microwave, the air-conditioner required a 110 volt system.<br />
The interior of the van was finished with a deep blue carpet with matching seats. The walls were a light grey fabric resembling office dividers (though not quite so visually unpleasant &#8230; that&#8217;s assuming you find woven grey polyester appealing). All of the cabinets and doors were either solid oak or oak-laminated particle board, stained a nice medium brown, kind of an &#8220;off-coffee-with-double-cream-and-sugar&#8221;. The counter top in the kitchen was white. The ceiling was white vinyl (resembling those really bad car seats from the 70&#8217;s), with three windows at the front of the raised roof.<br />
Following the tour, we unloaded Dhar&#8217;s Ford Probe, putting most of the contents into the van. The remainder came with them back into the house. After setting the alarm, I informed my guests not to open any of the doors during the night, or face the music (or the siren, depends if the wailing suits your musical tastes or not).<br />
I took Stefan and Rebecca downstairs to the TV room (so named because that&#8217;s where my friends and I watched endless hours of Star Trek, the X-Files, and the Simpsons), where we had our fold-out bed (a necessity in any family). Dhar was given the option of having a room all to himself for the evening, namely my sister&#8217;s room (my sister was finishing school in Ottawa at the time, and wouldn&#8217;t be home until we were well on our way). In less than five minutes, Dhar was settled in.<br />
I continued to run about for the next half-hour, assembling what remained of the things I was bringing, retrieved the sleeping bag, put out my pack sack of clothes, the CDs, books and so forth in the front hall. By the time I was done it was almost 02:00, and I was exhausted. I knew that the next day was going to be a long one, so I headed to bed. Unfortunately, I could hardly sleep. I was too excited. A long awaited trip was about to begin, and I so desperately wanted to leave.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entire scenario began back in the heady days of what most university students refer to as &#8220;spring break&#8221;. In many cases, this involves an exodus from the country (Canada) to a warmer climate for approximately one week of drinking, frolicking, debauchery, and general mayhem. In our case, it was a break from classes to allow us to get caught up in the work we hadn&#8217;t yet started.<br />
It was also the time that friends of mine had set aside to bring their wedding party together. Scott E.<!--lliott--> and Teresa D.<!--unat--> had approximately eleven or twelve people in their wedding party, and arranged to have eleven of them meet in Kitchener for a few hours of introductions and too much food. Stefan S.<!--cherer-->, like myself, had been drafted as one of Scott&#8217;s groomsmen.<br />
Both Stefan and Rebecca J.<!--ohnston--> were long-time friends of Scott, remembering him back to when the three of them were in high school in Rainy River in northern Ontario. Rebecca wasn&#8217;t a part of the wedding party per se, but attended the party as part of the invitation and to visit with friends.<br />
During the course of the evening (which involved many games, some of which gave us unexpected, albeit humourous, insights into certain people&#8217;s sex lives), Stefan asked me what I had planned to do at the end of the term. I replied that I had no single thing in mind outside of starting my job. It was then that the idea of a road trip was first suggested. But unlike many other road trips that my friends or I had experienced, this was to be a voyage of an entirely different breed.<br />
Over the course of the next two months, about a hundred email messages passed between the inboxes and outboxes of Rebecca, Stefan, and myself, all intended to coordinate and plan the first vacation I would see in over 5 years. The logistics at times seemed to be a nightmare, and more than once the trip came on the verge of getting canceled. But in the end, the pieces fell together, and the plan came to fruition.<br />
But before you continue any further, you should learn more about who I was traveling with. (It&#8217;s kind of important, seeing as I played as much a role in the whole fiasco as them.) Unlike some of my previous excursions, this cast is a small one, so you can come to get to know these people much better and much quicker.<br />
I first met Rebecca J.<!--ohnston--> in the summer of 1992, when I was working for Digital Equipment of Canada Ltd. in Ottawa. One night I was visiting with Scott at his place in Nepean (Scott was working for the Federal Government at the time), when the door bell rang. A moment later Stefan, Rebecca, and Eric walked in the room. Eric is Rebecca&#8217;s son, though not by Stefan (Eric&#8217;s father is often euphemistically referred to as &#8220;The Sperm Donor&#8221;).<br />
I must admit that at first I was immediately attracted to Rebecca &#8212; she is a very beautiful woman. When I later learned of Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s relationship, I put aside any attraction for Rebecca (it&#8217;s a personal policy of mine not to interfere in other&#8217;s relationships). This relationship has since culminated with her second child (and Stefan&#8217;s first), a darling girl named Thea.<br />
Rebecca is a strong woman: physically, mentally, and emotionally. Strong willed and highly intelligent, it&#8217;s hard to wage a battle of the wits with her &#8212; unless you happen to be well educated and open-minded, you are bound to lose. Having graduated from Queen&#8217;s University in Kingston with a degree in Women&#8217;s Studies, Rebecca pursued volunteer work at the &#8220;Sex Clinic&#8221; where until just prior to the trip she was its director. A full-time position as mother and wife with a husband still in school, Rebecca also searched for a full-time paying job. At the time of the trip, Rebecca was 22 years old.<br />
All I new of Dharmendra N.<!--oorhasan--> prior to the trip was that he was one of Stefan&#8217;s male classmates, and had a penchant for computers and cars (which according to Rebecca, was all that Dhar and Stefan ever spoke of). Beyond that, I knew nothing of what would eventually become a compatriot on our tour of the Midwest.<br />
Like any Queen&#8217;s engineering student I have ever met, Dhar (as he preferred to be called) was well versed in cars. (This habit among engineers is still mostly a mystery to me &#8212; even Computer Engineers seem to know far too much about their Honda Preludes.) As Rebecca predicted, Stefan and Dhar talked at length of cars throughout the trip, despite regular protests from Rebecca (often in the form of a change in topic). Dhar was also a computer wizard, having already designed several networks for the Federal Government of Canada.<br />
His parentage of African origin, Dhar was a naturalized Canadian, and like many Canadians he hated the winter. From his parents he developed his taste for spicy food, a taste that unfortunately was never truly satisfied during the trip &#8212; even a true Cajun dish in New Orleans couldn&#8217;t bring tears to his eyes or sweat to his brow. Dhar was 26 at the time of the trip.<br />
I met Stefan S.<!--cherer--> at the same time I met Rebecca. Admittedly, I got along with Stefan much better than I did Rebecca at first, but that was due to two things: a sharing of common interests, and my discomfort around Rebecca (a result of my aforementioned attraction &#8212; I was a very shy person back then).<br />
Stefan first came to Canada from Germany at the age of 12. He quickly learned the English language and many of the customs. Even today he makes the odd slip of the tongue (although I&#8217;ve never caught one), and gets confused when he hears German then tries to speak English, but his efforts to fit in are awe-inspiring.<br />
Stefan possesses many qualities about him that I admire, not the least of which is his complete and utter devotion to his family &#8212; both his parent&#8217;s family and the one he has with Rebecca. I can only hope that should I ever reach the stage where I am to become a parent, I can possess as much love and strength for my family as Stefan has for his.<br />
Stefan was finishing his second-last year of his Electrical Engineering program at Queen&#8217;s University, and greatly looking forward to getting out. Many times he complained about the style of education he received there, and many times wished that he had gone to the University of Waterloo instead. Stefan was 21at the time of the trip.<br />
Lastly there was me, the Observer. More formally, I am Geoff Sowrey. At the time of the trip, I was 23 years old, having completed 98% of my university education. I won&#8217;t give you any description of me, I figure that as you read this incantation you will learn who and what I am.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A Dream&#8230;<br />
With a start, I realized that the fire I had felt had suddenly died off. No longer did I feel the burning from within and outside. I was cool once more, and I was clear headed. Once again, I was on a beach. Exactly where, I couldn&#8217;t tell, but it was warm wherever I was. Looking around me, I could see huge expanses of beach to the left of me and to the right of me. Behind were dense thickets of palm trees. All I could hear was the roar of the sea, and a faint mandolin that played an all too familiar tune, yet unnameable.<br />
The thickets moved for a moment, and I was joined by my friends. Chris, Hil, Kathryn, James, Linda, J, Ali, Stuart and Therese. They came and sat down next to me, and said not a word. We faced the west, for that was where the sun sets. Silently, we gazed into the horizon, to the disc of sinking gold. The orange glow illuminated in the front, casting long, dark shadows behind.<br />
The music grew gradually louder, to the point where it played softly from all around. No-one made move to determine from where the music came from. We all knew the song now, no-one cared where it came from. Everything was peaceful, we were together. Then, off to our right, a male voice said:<br />
Good night.<br />
James&#8217; alarm was almost immediately disconnected. It was 4:00, and none of us had enough sleep to keep us going for any length of time. We had to be on the bus for 5:15, instruments and all, so we could get to the airport for our flight at 10:05 that morning. Seem a little early to get up to catch a plane? It is if you&#8217;re leaving from Orlando, but not if you&#8217;ve got to travel to the west coast of Florida and leave from St. Petersburg / Clearwater.<br />
The last of our packing was done, and then we proceeded to clean the room up. That took some time. We had taken great care to keep the room from looking like a pig-sty (though we had successfully trashed the room about ten minutes after getting into the room on the first day), but still managed to make a mess. Because we had taken some care, clean-up didn&#8217;t take too long. At about 5:00, Suzi appeared at our door (finally), ready to inspect our home away from home. Agreeing with its condition after making a final clean in a couple of places, we gave her the key, hauled our stuff down to Dick who was waiting below.<br />
While we were packing and cleaning, Stuart was doodling. But he had a purpose. His doodle was a picture of &#8220;Bus From Hell&#8221; (Bus One). It was a gift to Dick for his thankless job, and all the help he had been during the past five days. It would later be supplemented with donations.<br />
Once the bus had been loaded, luggage, instruments and equipment all, we hopped on. Then things began to go awry. Murphy&#8217;s Law (or at least one of them) states that the chances of a bus malfunction are directly proportional to the necessity of that bus, and where you have to be in a certain amount of time. English translation: the damn thing wouldn&#8217;t start.<br />
I&#8217;m by no means a mechanical whiz, but I do know when an engine doesn&#8217;t turn over. Yes, we had a problem. So while Dick fiddled around with the battery, James began action, passing a sheet that everyone on the bus was to sign their name on, and an envelope to donate money to the &#8220;Fund for Dick&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Education&#8221;. After the second try to start the bus (which failed), people began to leave as it was getting a little warm in there. James blocked the way out, and wouldn&#8217;t let anyone leave until they had at least signed their names.<br />
The populace of Bus One gathered together on the sidewalk that surrounded the first parking lot. Dick had to use Bus Two&#8217;s radio to contact help (Warren was gone by then), but we didn&#8217;t know how long we had to wait. James continued collecting cash. Chris and I quickly noticed that we stood a chance of being stranded in Florida. Oh bummer! I guess we have to go to Daytona after all! I returned to the bus for a moment for three things: my camera, Stothart&#8217;s camera and my journal. I took a photo, Stothart took two or three, and I wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40791.06</strong><br />
<em>Day 6</em><br />
Right now we should be about a half hour to St. Petersburg. However, Bus #1 experienced technical difficulties and we&#8217;re still at the Days Inn. Crewe and Stothart were going to judge the success of the trip by the number of couples formed. Hil and Shawn formed one. I can safely say that I did not get any closer to a relationship than I was before I left. Oh yeah,<br />
BUTTCHEESE!!
</p></blockquote>
<p>At around 6:05 that morning, a half hour after we were supposed to have left, the repair truck appeared on the scene. Two minutes later, Bus One roared to life. We immediately hauled aboard, not wasting any time. But we didn&#8217;t leave right away. First we had to make presentations. So James got to the front of the bus, was given the mike to the p.a. system and presented Dick with Stuart&#8217;s drawing, and over $100.<br />
Dick was pleased, to use an understatement. He wasn&#8217;t exuberant, but he was delighted to have driven us around. Then he told us about his &#8220;I Love Me Wall&#8221;, which had all his pictures, trophies and whatnot, dating from his days in the navy. Dick added that Stuart&#8217;s picture was destined for that wall. I&#8217;ll tell ya, that&#8217;s an honour &#8211; and I mean it too! Then Dick swore to have us in St. Pete&#8217;s in time for our flight.<br />
By 6:25, we were on the highway, heading west. It was still dark outside, but you could just see the patchy fog hugging the ground through the breaks in the trees. I listened to AC/DC for the umpteenth time, to keep myself from falling asleep. I like to experience life whenever possible. Besides, I hate sleeping in road vehicles &#8211; it&#8217;s annoying.<br />
Over the course of a couple hours, the country side got brighter and brighter, the sun was slowly rising behind us as we streaked across the panhandle. I tried to take a picture of the rising sun, but I missed it both times I tried. The first time it disappeared behind a building; the second into the clouds. We wouldn&#8217;t see the sun again until we were in the air.<br />
While I was looking towards the back of the bus, trying to take that picture, I caught sight of Therese and Stuart sleeping on each other. Normally, it would have bothered me. For some reason, I knew it to be the right thing. For a few moments, I stared for no reason. Then I smiled inwardly, and returned to my view forward.<br />
After passing more hotels and fast food restaurants than an elephant could remember, we arrived in St. Petersburg, in more than enough time to catch our plane. Dick maneuvered the bus like an expert (waiting for some yahoo to get out of our way), stopped and wished us safe passage as we disembarked. Then we unloaded our stuff from Dick&#8217;s bus for the last time. I think I cried.<br />
Dumping our bags on the curb as instructed, we took the remainder of our stuff and did our best to line up in alphabetical order. We were told that this was the way we were going to receive our tickets (oh joy!), but it turned out that it was so they could easily check off our names at &#8220;check-in&#8221;. We basically showed them our passports and moved on.<br />
Instructed to meet at Gate 6 for 9:30, we moved on to do what we wanted until such time. Chris and I landed in a group of chairs and slacked off for a while. Chris was asked to take one of the seven trophies on as carry-on, and had to lug that around as well. Before long, we were watching most of the trophies and a motherlode of bags. The owners were upstairs eating breakfast. I was waiting for the in-flight, I didn&#8217;t want to break another traveler&#8217;s check.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
We made it, loads o&#8217; time to spare. Dick has told us that he&#8217;ll mount Stuart&#8217;s picture &amp; the signature sheet on his &#8220;I Love Me&#8221; wall. Now we get to wait about an hour for our friggin&#8217; flight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I&#8217;m tired, my brain has a nasty habit of not storing small details. That&#8217;s why it may seem that parts of this day may be moving faster than usual. Chris and I sat there for most of the time up to about 9:15, when people gave us our tickets. Chris and I wanted to sit together if it was possible, so Chris went back to Stothart to see if we could get our exchanged. While Chris was doing that, I collected our stuff (the only stuff left by that point) and brought it up to the gate, where Stothart was surrounded by a swarm of students.<br />
Chris emerged from the swarm, wielding our tickets home. Then he started down the hall to where we sat. Chris was tired, he hadn&#8217;t noticed that I had his stuff. After whistling him back, we got into line for the x-ray machine. Over the p.a., we could hear the airline calling our rows to board. Soon, we knew that final boarding call would be sounded.<br />
After dumping my crap on the conveyor, I passed through the metal detector (and for the first time in my life, didn&#8217;t set it off!) and await my stuff to come. Chris however, got nailed. He had to make a couple of passes through the contraption, each time having to take something else off. It was beginning to look more like a strip search. He finally passed through (I had picked up his stuff again) and were on our way out when Chris noticed that he didn&#8217;t have his jean jacket. I hadn&#8217;t realized that he had sent it through the x-ray machine too.<br />
Then we left the building. St. Petersburg / Clearwater is the birthplace of modern air travel (at least, according to the plaque they had near one of the doors), and had no terminal boarding, we had to get on from the tarmac. It was probably for the better, we got a last breath of Florida air. It was also my last picture.<br />
After climbing into our Canada 3000 757 aircraft, we found our seats, took the barf bags, and prepared for the flight out. I considered sleeping during the flight, but two and bit hours isn&#8217;t worth it. At about 10:00 (give or take ten minutes), the hatches were closed and the engines brought up to speed. This interrupted the safety speech (darn!) for a few moments, but then we were on a roll.<br />
A few minutes later, we hit the airways for home. Jess was seated with Chris and I, on the window side, Chris between us. Jess was deeply engrossed in her homework, I was engrossed in the in-flight movie&#8230; until I found out what it was. &#8220;Three Men And A Little Lady&#8221; is something I can&#8217;t take before 18:00, it won&#8217;t settle with my stomach, though there are a few funny parts.<br />
Within moments of the film starting, the trolley of drinks came around. Because it wasn&#8217;t a breakfast flight, we also got those teeny bags of nuts. I want to know who the moron is who designed those little packages. I can almost inhale the contents there&#8217;s so little. How &#8217;bout a small ziplock bag eh? That would be a little more like it!<br />
Anyway, the nuts and the beverage went quickly. Next to come was lunch. Jess, being a vegetarian, was asked to identify herself so that she wouldn&#8217;t get one of the normal lunches, and would receive and vegetarian-approved meal. After seeing hers, I was glad to be an omnivore.<br />
We omnivores had a chicken-something dish with pasta salad, carrots, rice, a bun and a cheesecake dessert (which I donated to Chris as I rather dislike cheesecake). By the time I was done, there wasn&#8217;t a lot left on my tray. When I&#8217;m hungry, I&#8217;ll eat most airplane food given to me. I can&#8217;t understand why some people hate airplane food. I think it&#8217;s rather well made, and in general, Canadian airlines have good meals (though I&#8217;m told USAir also has good meals, my previous experience with them has told me otherwise).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong><br />
We&#8217;re now on our friggin&#8217; flight, headed for home. Unlike the in-flight movie on the way down (which was Home Alone), I&#8217;m not going to even bother with this one (aside from the commercial clip scenes).Lunch was tasty, I can&#8217;t understand why people say airplane food is tasteless. I rather like it myself. Mind you, it&#8217;s probably full of MSG.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Once my tray was removed, I leaned my chair back and drifted into the tunes from my walkman. I became so relaxed, time blitzed right by me. I might have even fallen asleep. Before I knew it, Chris was jarring me awake, taking my earphone plug and putting it into the airplane&#8217;s jack in the armrest. It was Paul Simon&#8217;s &#8220;Obvious Child&#8221; from &#8220;Rhythm Of The Saints&#8221;. I love that song, so I tried to sing it in my head. Then I remembered that Therese still had my CD of &#8220;Rhythm Of The Saints&#8221;, not to mention my alarm clock. I made a mental note to get them back,<br />
Pressure in my ears led me to believe that we were descending, meaning we weren&#8217;t far off from Toronto, from home. In the back of my head, I began to play one of Phil Collins&#8217; greatest hits, Take Me Home. Ever since the Soviet Union trip in the summer of 1989, I always think of the song when I return home.<br />
The plane banked and passed over Toronto out towards Pickering. Then the plane banked again, turning back towards Toronto. We got lower and lower, the flaps extended fully on the wings. People soon became visible as individuals; the wheels lowered and the rushing air roared in the compartments below us. We shot over the 427 and Airport Road, over to the runway. The wheels finally hit, we were bounced a fair bit, but we were down.<br />
Ten minutes later, we arrived at our Terminal One docking bay, and prepared to disembark. Because we were so far back in the plane, we knew that it was going to be some time before we got off. I didn&#8217;t realize just how slow. But soon, the line began to move, the three of us rose to take our positions in line, butting just in front of Bird and Crewe (not my fault if they take too long).<br />
Then came the maze of stairs and hallways that eventually got us to Immigration and Customs Canada. There were only two lines open when we got there, but a third opened quickly. I immediately rushed over to the new line so I could get through and get our bags. Chris was not so expedient and was a bit further back. I told him that I would retrieve his.<br />
Ahead of me, I heard the clerk as the person ahead of me what they had bought, and mentioned receipts. My heart stopped a moment. I had receipts for some of the stuff, but it would add up to over the limit I was allowed (yeah, I smuggled stuff in &#8211; name someone who didn&#8217;t). When my turn came, I had an excuse. When I was asked the question, I spilled my guts (excuse only), and got passed through.<br />
Next was baggage claim. Stuart and Therese had already snagged Chris&#8217; and my bags (how nice of them!), I plopped them both on the cart I had taken from the rack. We were now waiting for all the instruments to come out, so we could collect them and pass through to the outside.<br />
In the meantime, I made a collect phone call (phoning out of Pearson is long distance, yet phoning in isn&#8217;t &#8211; go figure!) to home to let my parents know that we were alive and the plane hadn&#8217;t been blown up by terrorists. Oh yeah, and to get a lift home. At first I thought we would only be about two hours, but I was wrong.<br />
After we had finally received all the pieces once more, we carted them outside, to Canada as we knew it. The swarm of us hovered there for a while until we were told to take all the stuff to the loading area outside of the building. Like willing slaves, we followed orders.<br />
Before long, the line of luggage and instruments had taken up most of the island in the middle of the pick-up road. We were waiting for two buses and a truck to carry our luggage and instruments. A half hour passed without show, and I made another call to home, setting pick-up back about an hour.<br />
Ten minutes or so after that, the truck and buses appeared from out of the blue. Loading began almost instantly. When the truck had been about three-quarters filled, those who weren&#8217;t loading were told to get on the buses for head count. By that time, it was a case of &#8220;the sooner we get home, the better!&#8221;<br />
The buses revved up, and moved out. After stopping to replace the antennae on the buses (they smash the overhead lights when they&#8217;re on), we hit the highway. It didn&#8217;t take long to lose the truck, which couldn&#8217;t go very fast because of the delicate cargo. Forty-five minutes passed before we saw the familiar sights of home, and school. None of us could take off as of yet though, we had to unload the truck first.<br />
Most of the parents were already there. Therese&#8217;s parents were happy to see her and Danica, as Stuart&#8217;s parents were glad to see Stuart. Then the two families began talking. I watched from a distance, and tried to think of what they&#8217;d be taking about. That&#8217;s when I learned that I shouldn&#8217;t think of those kinds of things when I&#8217;m tired&#8230; I got depressed again.<br />
It only took ten minutes to get all the instruments off the bus and back to their positions in the music room. My parents had arrived by then, Chris and I wasted no time in leaving. Naturally, we were hit with several questions dealing with out activities in the past five days, and we answered as best we could.<br />
My parents pulled into our driveway, where they got out. I took the keys, and drove Chris home. When we pulled into Chris&#8217; driveway a few minutes later, his father was waiting on the front porch.<br />
&#8220;I hate to disappoint you, but I brought him home!&#8221;<br />
Chris and I talked for a few more minutes, and discussed what we would do for the remainder of the day. I was hoping to get some sleep, and I really needed a shower. But first I wanted to get home. So I bid Chris farewell until school the next day, and returned to my humble abode.<br />
After relieving myself, I began to unpack. That only took fifteen minutes (almost as long as it took me to get it all in there!). I was happy to see that my parents hadn&#8217;t tried clean my room in my absence, it was exactly as I had left it&#8230; in a state of perfect disorganization. Yessir, I was home again.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t go to sleep. I wish I had, I might have even beat Kathryn&#8217;s record of fourteen hours of sleep. Instead, I began to write this story, so I wouldn&#8217;t forget it easily. I did have that shower too, which made me feel a lot better. I watched a little tv, cleaned out the fridge (I was a bit peckish) and checked on my bike (I had sent it in to be fixed &#8211; too expensive for me so I found).<br />
I went to bed early that night, the week&#8217;s events had completely worn me out. As I lay there in my own bed, staring at a dark ceiling, I thought of all that we had done in the past week. And I thought: &#8220;Was it worth the $714?&#8221; I could only come up with one answer&#8230;<br />
Every damn cent of it!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Final Supplemental</strong><br />
I haven&#8217;t done any of my homework, I&#8217;ve either been too busy or I just haven&#8217;t been bothered to do it. As for physics however, I ain&#8217;t luggin&#8217; a twenty pound text around Florida. The temp here is warm, comparable to that of Florida. It&#8217;s nice to be home, yet I still wish I was back in an area of Florida where the tourist population is low (i.e. Riviera Beach) for the next month. Tonight, we&#8217;re all going to sleep well, for tomorrow, we&#8217;re back in Hell!

		<p>A Dream&#8230;</p>
<p>Carrots, the final frontier.<br />
These are the voyages of the U.S.S. Rabbit.<br />
It&#8217;s continuing mission:<br />
To seek out new carrot patches,<br />
And new mates to breed with&#8230;<br />
To boldly go where no bunny has gone before!!<br />
Captain&#8217;s Log: Haredate 52461.352</p>
<p>We are presently in orbit around Cottontail IV, in the Long Ear system. We&#8217;ve spent three days on the run from Earl. After abandoning him in the Blue Carrot system twenty years ago, he has sworn revenge. He has already taken out my WarpHop drive and my Rabbit Droppings Torpedoes. Long-range Whisker sensors are also out, repair time by Snotty puts it at four days.</p>
<p>&#8220;CAPTAIN JERK! CAPTAIN JERK! The U.S.S. Jackrabbit is on short range whisker sensors!&#8221; calls a cadet from one side of the bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Spot! What is her status?&#8221; I ask of my Science Officer. He peers into the sensor readout, looks up (twitches his nose) and replies: &#8220;They&#8217;ve locked Carrot Cannons on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;EVASIVE ACTION! RAISE FUR-WARD SHIELDS!&#8221; I order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, the shields are not responding!&#8221; says Woof, in his low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;DAMN THE TORPEDOES!!&#8221; I shout in desperation. The bridge turns dead silent, all eyes turn to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, you are thinking of the wrong movie.&#8221; informs Spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh shut up!&#8221; I mumble. The ship is suddenly rocked by a tremendous explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain! We&#8217;ve been hit!&#8221; calls a cadet.</p>
<p>&#8220;NO SHIT! Tell me something I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; I retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Weapons systems are down, shields will fail in thirteen seconds.&#8221; reports Woof.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! That I didn&#8217;t know. Mind you, I wish I still didn&#8217;t know.&#8221; I reply, not particularly liking the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir! Decks two through six are on fire!&#8221; shouts Snotty&#8217;s interpreter (that damn accent makes Snotty impossible to understand).</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Let me guess, the fire is going up right?&#8221; I ask sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes sir.&#8221; replies the interpreter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great! Just what I needed to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Self destruct will occur in ten seconds&#8230; &#8221; says the computer monotonically.</p>
<p>&#8220;SELF DESTRUCT?! WHO THE HELL ENGAGED THAT?&#8221; I demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever the upper six decks catch on fire, the self destruct sequence automatically activates.&#8221; replies Spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;WHY DOESN&#8217;T ANYONE EVER TELL ME THESE THINGS?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; five&#8230; four&#8230; three&#8230; two&#8230; one&#8230; have a nice day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;OH FUCK YOU!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I woke up, again to James&#8217; alarm clock. However, no one moved at first, someone just punched the snooze bar. A little later on, the alarm went off again. This time I happened to look up to the clock. At first I didn&#8217;t think much of it (my brain was still recovering from my multiple memory lapses from the day before), but I quickly realized that we had only twenty-five minutes to get to the bus.</p>
<p>What can I say? That was the quickest any of us had moved in five days. James took a shower (he really moves when he does &#8211; ten minutes, tops), I only wetted my hair down (major case of bed-head that morning). Soon, the five of us were blurs, getting clothes, drying off, brushing our teeth (you get the picture).</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, we were in the process of vacating our room. Dick was there once more, awaiting our arrival with his usual cheery morning self. The bus was loaded as quickly as possible (we didn&#8217;t have much time to waste), everyone helping. Dick hit the road, and we were on our way to the University Of Central Florida, where the choirs would perform.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40691.083</strong></p>
<p><em>Day 5</em></p>
<p>This morning was off to a rather interesting start to say the very least, we woke up about 25 minutes before we had to be on our bus. Why? Because James, Stuart and Chris wouldn&#8217;t shut their traps, talking about Earl. God that pissed me off! Now we&#8217;re waiting on the bus for our progression to the music festival.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The university was some distance from our hotel (where in Orlando I&#8217;m not sure, but we seemed to follow familiar routes), so it gave some of us time to snooze. I don&#8217;t sleep on buses, it drives me crazy. Linda had brought a bag of cinnamon rolls, and offered them to several people. I declined when asked, I can&#8217;t eat too many seasonings anymore (no thanks to my mom).</p>
<p>Next thing I knew, I saw a sign that read University Of Central Florida. We had arrived. Dick turned up the roadway and pulled into a parking lot near some buildings. Then Beber and Roser hopped out and disappeared down a wide walkway between some buildings. A few moments later they reappeared (just as the population of our bus was about to disembark), and had Dick drive less than fifty feet down the walkway. Why? Don&#8217;t ask me (though I think it was so that some of the electrical stuff could be easily unloaded and carted off without giving anyone a hernia).</p>
<p>Jazz Choir was immediately herded into a small performance building (we were almost bordering on late), the rest of us remained outside. It was now getting rather warm, the sun was rising, and the humidity wasn&#8217;t helping any. While we waited outside, Jessica Wallace happened to notice my journal (I brought it with me for some reason), and asked if she could read it. I seem to have no quandaries about sharing my thoughts (as personal as they sometimes are). I gotta remember to start coming up with a few.</p>
<p>Allen (who incidentally was our tour guide &#8211; yes, I did finally remember his name) appeared with another man who directed into the building across from the performance hall. We were led down a few hallways until we were in a music room. Suzi led us in warm-up.</p>
<p>For Stuart and I, singing is not easily done without Chris (all I need is another bass to sing by, preferably a loud one), There were four &#8220;men&#8221; in the room, out of thirty or so. One of the &#8220;men&#8221; was Jess, she was a female tenor during the trip. Stuart and I faired our best with the bass line (we were much too quiet &#8211; we needed another bass). Overall, the warm-up went rather well, covering the last few bars of Saints, the one section we still screwed up.</p>
<p>About twenty or thirty minutes later, our warm-up was declared over by Allen, and we were hustled out of the warm-up room, and back outside into the heat. We headed right for the performance hall. We did not enter though, just lined up in our rows for singing. Then we brought Suzi to the verge of killing us for being so loud.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something to be said for expectations. I honestly thought that due to the size of the festival that we would be performing in a large auditorium, filled with screaming fans (yeah, right!). Well, I could see through the windows into the auditorium, I could see Chris from where I stood. That was no large auditorium, it was down-right puny.</p>
<p>About ten minutes after we had exited the warm-up room, another choir appeared. There were only four choirs performing in our division (whatever that was), we had two of them. This choir scared the living shit out of me. All the guys looked identical from the neck down. Black tuxedos, blue cummerbunds (which matched the girls&#8217; dresses), black pants and shoes. In our little group, there wasn&#8217;t one matching shirt. The girls wore dresses that looked like left-over prom gowns. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I thought it was too tacky.</p>
<p>Next thing we knew, our behinds were being hustled into the auditorium. Not even a quarter of the seats were full (not terribly surprising). For a few moments we hung around the back of the room (we couldn&#8217;t go on stage just yet) and Chris, James and J changed into their white choir shirts. Then Stothart called us to stage, and we booted right down. In about thirty seconds, we were prepped and ready.</p>
<p>Our adjudicator sat on the other side of the room, at the back, alone. The thought that we had only one person judging our singing left me feeling both relieved and uneasy. I had to put those feelings aside however, for I knew that if I kept thinking about it, I&#8217;d screw up a note, maybe an entire bar (or a song). Then to make me feel all the better, a few people from the other school (the Smurfs, as they were dubbed by us) came in to watch.</p>
<p>The songs were the same three we had been singing during the entire time in Florida, and in the same order: Ezekiel, True Colours and Saints. Stothart called out the first song, and we began. Ezekiel went without a hitch, it was the only song we could do completely in our sleep. Mine ears didst not intake sour notes from True Colours (another relief), I think that had us wound up for the final song. Once again, we screwed the ending of Saints up. James told me to stuff it when I mumbled it, but it was my comment, I was allowed to make it, even if others didn&#8217;t agree. Besides, I was probably blaming myself for losing time (the ending always pissed me off).</p>
<p>I thought that we would then leave. WRONG! We quickly found out why the sessions were in half-hour blocks, even though we sung for only a maximum of fifteen minutes. The adjudicator then came up to us, congratulated us on our efforts, then offered us some suggestions.</p>
<p>He basically stuck to Ezekiel, and not much else. He corrected our pronunciation and annunciation of the song (we weren&#8217;t that far off, but the changes were certainly apparent). I&#8217;ll say one thing for musical judges (and also teachers), they are a strange bunch. All of them are quite open and loose. I haven&#8217;t met a crabby one yet.</p>
<p>Once we had been grilled and sautéed, we exited in an orderly fashion to about the back of the room, where our usual mayhem resumed. Then, some people taking a piece of equipment (there were more people than pieces), returned to the buses. We had to travel (supposedly) to the other side of Orlando. Little did we know that Apopka High School was past the other side, in another county altogether.</p>
<p>When we got back to the bus, we had breakfast. It was either Dick, or our chaperones (though I understand it was our bitchin&#8217; driver, Dick), but we ended up with a slew of donuts. Yes, this was our breakfast. While we chomped down on those, we headed out for our next stop. Neither of the choirs had to perform any more, they were done. Now it was the bands&#8217; turn. It was a little past 10:00. Wind Ensemble was due up at 11:00 for their adjudication.</p>
<p>Traffic was not with us that day, it seemed that most of the drivers on the road wanted to own it that day. It wasn&#8217;t helping us any. At least Dick knew where he was going (we certainly did not, and I still have no idea where we went exactly).</p>
<p>Still curious why I named this chapter I See The Bad Mood Risin&#8217; ? When we got on the bus that morning, I was seated near the rear of the bus, behind Stuart and Therese (by a couple rows). Yes, that was when it started. That was why I tried to stay at the front of the bus, so this wouldn&#8217;t happen. It&#8217;s not their fault, it&#8217;s mine. I should have known better. After all, what they did came naturally.</p>
<p>So while we were on the bus for roughly an hour, whipping through various unexplored sections of the Orlando area, my disposition had time to ferment. Unfortunately, my attitude doesn&#8217;t always improve with age. It only got worse.</p>
<p>After more turns than a River Oaks subdivision, we finally arrived at our destination&#8230; late. It was only by a few minutes, but we were now more pressed for time than ever. People were off like a shot. Everyone helped bringing in instruments and equipment. All the band players disappeared for warm-up, leaving the remainder of us to move the rest of the stuff to the auditorium stage for the performance.</p>
<p>Apopka High School was by far the largest high school I had ever seen. Their main hall was not only full of trophies, but doubled as their cafeteria. I wondered what it would be like attending that place, but I quickly remembered the homely feeling one gets from OT (most likely that feeling one gets after being knocked unconscious by falling pieces of roof).</p>
<p>Bird and I hauled a Harley Davidson bag full of stands (I believe they were for the cymbals, all I know is that they weighed a bloody tonne &#8211; my hands cramped up under the strain) into the auditorium, then I booted back for more stuff. There was none. So we packed up the instrument cases (which had been flung everywhere) and put them off to one side. Not really knowing what to do next, I went into the auditorium to await the performance, sitting one side to the left of Kara Coghill. This was intentional, I wanted to leave a seat for Geoff (her boyfriend). Right off, I knew that this was no ordinary high school, the auditorium was much too large for most Canadian schools.</p>
<p>Roughly twenty minutes later, the first signs of the band appeared on the stage. OT was the last concert band to play, all the others had gone earlier that morning. Fortunately, those in charge did not seem to care that we were late. From my position, I could see the adjudicators (as they had been pointed out by the MC), there were three this time. I couldn&#8217;t wait to see what happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong></p>
<p>Aside from a couple of foul-ups, the Choir did really well. The adjudicator gave us a few helpful hints to boot! Then we got a blast of donuts (thanks to our illustrious driver, Dick&#8230; I think). Call it a hunch, but I think I&#8217;m beginning to piss a few people off in our group. I&#8217;m still debating whether or not to go to the dance tonight. As the moment we&#8217;re listening to Wind Ensemble as they proceed to kick ass in their competition.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m almost certain that I was developing a couple enemies, namely Kathryn. Then again, I could be wrong. But I noticed a distinct change in the way she acted around me, and I couldn&#8217;t figure out why. It may have been that word leaked about my interest in her, but since the warning, the interest had been strongly suppressed.</p>
<p>Wind Ensemble played their lungs out, but only two of their three pieces. I had never timed their full performance before, but I have a funny feeling that the third piece would&#8217;ve taken them beyond the fifteen minute limit (either that or they were asked to cut it short). Despite the lack of one piece, their performance was excellent.</p>
<p>Then began the Jazz bands. There were only three to listen to, and two of them were from OT. The first band was American, from which State I don&#8217;t recall (not that I forgot, I just wasn&#8217;t that interested at the time), they virtually got a standing ovation (accompanied by very loud, screeching cheers) from the back of the auditorium.</p>
<p>The band was fairly small, about ten people at the most. Right off I noticed one of the saxophone players. He seemed to me kind of egotistical, though I can&#8217;t figure out why I derived such an impression from him. He was also the soloist, and played a mean horn. The only thing that I didn&#8217;t like about that group was the conductor, who seemed like he was stoned. The best, and most memorable piece that the group did was the Flintstones theme. That was cool!</p>
<p>Then it was OT&#8217;s turn to strut their stuff. First up was the Jazz Ensemble. Don&#8217;t ask me what pieces they played, I couldn&#8217;t tell you. In comparison to the previous band, OT&#8217;s jazz group seemed less energetic than their competitors, and that bothered me. However, it&#8217;s good that I wasn&#8217;t one of the adjudicators, or OT wouldn&#8217;t have done as well as we did.</p>
<p>The final group was OT&#8217;s Jazz Combo. They weren&#8217;t competing as such, they just wanted a rating (there was some full-length term for the rating name, but I only heard it once). As they were setting up, Stothart nearly tipped the piano over (I got it on film). But soon, they were off.</p>
<p>Once everyone had finished, a raft of trophies were brought out. One of them stood above all the others, and I was curious to know what it was for. At 13:10, the awards ceremony began. The first that they did was clear up the morning&#8217;s choir awards. At first I was surprised that this happened, but seeing as it was the same festival, it did make sense. Jazz Choir (not surprisingly), pulled off a Superior rating for their performance. Concert got an Excellent (which was more than I expected).</p>
<p>Quick run down of awards! With choirs, the rank went from Superior to Excellent, to Very Good to Good, and finally to Participation (Ugh!). Now I don&#8217;t know if there was more than one choir per level, but I really don&#8217;t care. Fact was, we did good!</p>
<p>Then we proceeded to the concert bands. Of course, Wind Ensemble won, they took first (they had actual placings for the bands). The other three school in there with us received their placings, and we were virtually deafened by the schools behind us. Kara and I commented on the brashness of those schools. OT made feeble attempts to try and out-scream them, but because it ain&#8217;t our style, it just can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<p>Jazz Bands came next. OT nearly swept this category. Aside from the placings (from which I believe OT got first again), we won all but one of the awards. I was surprised when they began to do awards for separate people within each band. I was even more surprised when we won best saxophonist (Allison Humphries). I was expecting the guy from the first band. Then came a let down. Best trumpet player when to another school. Had Chris Colohan been able to come, we&#8217;d-a-had that one too! Then came Best Rhythm Sectionist (it was beginning to sound like the Academy Awards if you ask me). Everyone from OT thought it would be Shawn Abedin. It was Paul Taylor who won, none were as surprised as he.</p>
<p>The last award was roughly four feet tall. By that time, OT had amassed seven (which was damn good by my books), I didn&#8217;t think that we really needed another. When the award was read out to be presented to a marching band, I heard an audible sigh of relief from several people around me, counting their blessings about having to lug that one around. The school at the back of the room won, and I nearly went deaf from the screaming. It is nice to have school spirit, but there is such a thing as taking it too far.</p>
<p>With the awards finished, it was time to move out. We were warned three or four times about sunburns (all the festival participants were going to Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild that afternoon) before leaving. I wish I had brought my shorts and a t-shirt, my choir uniform began to get a little uncomfortable after a while.</p>
<p>By 13:40, the bus had been loaded. Chris, being the diplomat he was, congratulated another performer from another school (good for Chris, though I couldn&#8217;t remember the guy performing &#8211; I was probably writing something down). Someone spotted one of the lizards indigenous to Florida, they can climb most vertical surfaces. My aunt had hundreds of those little buggers at her house near West Palm Beach. Therese, of course, was enthralled by the discovery.</p>
<p>Soon, we were on our way. Now, I&#8217;m writing this part of the story in a fairly agreeable mood. That day, at about the time we were leaving, I wasn&#8217;t doing to well. I hadn&#8217;t yet reached my lowest point, but was on a downhill slide.</p>
<p>First, we were going to snag some lunch. At first we desperately tried to get to McDonald&#8217;s, but were all ruled out by one vegetarian. Even though McD&#8217;s sold salads, they (yes, I will not release the name) refused to eat them. Instead, we ended up at a Wendy&#8217;s. Next door was a Taco Bell, Dunkin Donuts and a Pizza Hut. We couldn&#8217;t go any further than the Taco Bell. It really didn&#8217;t matter to me, I wasn&#8217;t hungry.</p>
<p>When Dick pulled in, people immediately began to get off. Soon, the bus was empty, except for Dick and myself. Here&#8217;s the reason why I liked Dick so much:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to lunch?&#8221; asked Dick from the front of the bus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nah, not really feelin&#8217; hungry.&#8221; I replied, trying to sound normal, &#8220;Besides, I ain&#8217;t got a lot of cash left.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, my treat!&#8221; he prompted, not letting me get off with that much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother, you&#8217;ll only waste your money. Thanks anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; said Dick, a little more sternly, but still in a humourous sort of way, &#8220;I don&#8217;t do this for everyone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just not that hungry. But I do appreciate the offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. But I&#8217;m locking the bus, you can&#8217;t get off and no-one can get on! I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; somethin&#8217; to eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, Dick hopped off the bus and closed the door. I sat their for a few moments, listening to Dick fumbling with the key. About a minute later (and a ring of keys), he reopened the door and announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;Then again, maybe not!&#8221; The both of us burst out laughing.</p>
<p>So I remained on the bus, completely alone, my stomach growling. I wasn&#8217;t lying when I said I wasn&#8217;t hungry. My stomach was, but I wasn&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t have eaten anything from either of those places. While I sat there, listening to either Sting or AC/DC, I thought I heard a knock at the bus door. I stopped the tape, listened for a moment, then hit play. Moments later, a knocking at my window lead me to concluding that I had heard a knock at the door, it was Chris wanting in.</p>
<p>Taco Bell had sufficed him (I do believe that was where he went &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t really matter, as he didn&#8217;t buy much), and he was back. I told him just to pull on the door, he opened it himself. While I was at the front though, I spotted the leftover donuts. I snitched two and munched on those for a while. Chris complained about that, I pointed out that no-one else was eating them, therefore putting them to waste.</p>
<p>Therese, James, Stuart and Linda returned a few minutes later with their Taco Bell orders. Linda was actually pleased to a point with the spices (Linda could probably drink a bottle of Tobasco sauce straight without blinking).</p>
<p>Within twenty minutes, the bus was full again, and we were on our way back to the hotel. From there, it was to Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild, where we would be until about 22:00 that night. There was no way out of the dance for me, aside from not leaving the hotel once we got back. That was not much of an option as far as I was concerned.</p>
<p>When we hit the highway, my mood got worse, declining at the same speed as the bus went forward. Before I knew it, I was so deep into my rather morbid frame of mind, I didn&#8217;t give rat&#8217;s ass that we were going through downtown Orlando (the only time we would see it).</p>
<p>Then came Therese and Stuart. They decided to take upon themselves to either cheer me up or annoy me. The succeeded only in the later. They did so by pulling the earphones from my ears. The third time, which was Therese&#8217;s turn to pull one of them out, I snapped, yelling at Therese (though not too loudly).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing what one&#8217;s mind can remember. The entire day before was full of holes to which I have no filler. Yet this single action, me snapping at Therese, I remember so vividly, I still feel terrible about doing it everytime I think about it. I hadn&#8217;t felt like that much of a jackass in a long, long time. I was immediately regretful of that action.</p>
<p>Well, I was immediately shot down to the pits of hell at that point. Had I been carrying a knife (which I was not, luckily), I would have cut myself in several interesting places. Yes, you know that you&#8217;re in really deep shit when you think of suicide. So far, I&#8217;ve managed to talk myself out of it both times. I think that I may need some professional help sooner or later.</p>
<p>Once we got back to the hotel, we immediately booted up to our rooms to get the stuff we were going to need for that night. Waiting for Chris to come up and unlock the door, I took a picture of James wielding two of our seven new trophies. When Chris arrived, he said that J had the key. J had been there as long as the rest of us. Don&#8217;t ask me, I&#8217;ve never been able to figure J out. Come to think of it, he&#8217;d be good as part of the Canadian Government &#8211; we can&#8217;t figure them out either!</p>
<p>We changed quickly to our evening attire &#8211; bathing suits, t- shirts, shoes (no socks), Ron Jon&#8217;s cap on backwards. Then I filled my carry-on luggage with a towel, camera, walkman speakers (and walkman), journal and pullover. Then I booted down to the bus, donning my shades in the process. I had a mission to fulfill before we left.</p>
<p>I hopped on the bus, dumped my stuff in my seat, searched the bus for Therese and not seeing her, got off and went up to the second floor. I guess I must have been in overdrive, I was only one of five people ready to leave. So after waiting a few minutes, I went back on the bus to await for my quarry.</p>
<p>As soon as Therese entered the bus, I asked her to hold a moment, and apologized for my actions earlier that afternoon. Fortunately, Therese understands people in rotten moods, and accepted my apology. Lucky me, I have friends, very good friends who are more than I could ever dream of.</p>
<p>Then, feeling better for having said I was sorry, lay back and played music while Dick got us to party central. We traveled certain routes so bloody often, I could almost follow them in my sleep. We went by the same route we had followed the day before, passed the Mercado and before long, were out in front of Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild.</p>
<p>When we had boarded the bus, we were given tickets to the park and special white plastic wristbands (Chris and I still wear ours). These bands were necessary, we would have been kicked out without &#8217;em. Mind you, I had been contemplating about removing mine. I really didn&#8217;t want to stay, mainly because of the dance. No, my mood hadn&#8217;t improved too much (at least I wasn&#8217;t thinking of suicide any more).</p>
<p>After we had entered, we weren&#8217;t sure where to go. It was roughly 16:00, we had two hours before the population died any. Most, if not all of the other high schools were already there. Straight ahead of us was the wave pool (which was heavily crowded). A large group of us headed up the left side of the pool towards the middle of the complex (which seemed both larger and smaller than I had expected) until we reached the other end of the pool.</p>
<p>J, Ali, Chris, Hil, Yvonne and myself commandeered a couple tables and a raft of chairs. Stuart, Therese, James, Linda and Kathryn kept on going, we wouldn&#8217;t see any of them for about a half hour or so. Chris immediately sat down in the sun and began to tan. The rest of us followed suit. The sun may have been setting, but it was still strong enough to shed to light on the subject.</p>
<p>Within twenty minutes, I had lost the effectiveness of the sun, I wasn&#8217;t getting warm. I really hadn&#8217;t planned on getting a tan while I was there (Chris was the only one who darkened any), so there was no great loss. James, Stuart and Linda emerged from the wave pool and went back down to the other end (which was where they were positioned). James hung around for a while. That was about the time I began to notice&#8230; things.</p>
<p>Chris had probably noticed them long before myself, but I had taken off my sunglasses (just in case, I didn&#8217;t want pale circles around my eyes where the sun couldn&#8217;t get through) and had to close my eyes &#8211; or be blinded. When I donned my shades once more, I took more than my fill o&#8217; heavenly bodies. And it wasn&#8217;t even dark yet!</p>
<p>For the life of me, I have never been able to understand why women always seem to wear small, tight bathing suits (if they can even be called that anymore) and not feel like there are always hormone-hyper boys (they can&#8217;t be called &#8220;men&#8221; anymore, they&#8217;re too ga-ga by that time) staring at them, which they are. But please understand, I&#8217;M NOT COMPLAINING!</p>
<p>Then I noticed one other little interesting detail, this time about the staff. It seemed that Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild hired only physically perfect people, and reject all the ugly ones. This was one of those very few times that I was truly happy to be single. I could stare until my mind had successfully unclothed all the female staff I saw, and not have to worry &#8217;bout my girlfriend thrashing me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong></p>
<p>Well, I was right &#8211; both times. First, the Wind Ensemble did kick ass, as did Jazz Ensemble. They would have swept the Jazz category had C. Colohan come. As for the second &#8220;right&#8221;, I&#8217;m pretty sure I got a couple pissed off at me. I did accidentally snap at Therese when she and Stuart were fooling around with my earphones (while I was wearing them &#8211; I was in a nasty mood).We are now at Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild &#8211; and to a point Chris has made a valid observation&#8230; being single right now isn&#8217;t all bad, some of the employees are, shall we say, angels in very tight bathing suits. Still, I would like someone to share this time with. I would probably use one of those sayings that have been used since the beginning of time, only that I hate using them!
</p>

<p>About that time, J appeared from the wave pool (there was a ladder about two metres from where we were seated) and extolled the warmth of the waters. J almost immediately wanted to right back in. He talked me into it (not that it wasn&#8217;t much of a challenge), and we shot down to the other end to get in (they wouldn&#8217;t let you jump in the deep end &#8211; why? I don&#8217;t know).</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t kidding, the waters were really warm, at least eighty degrees Fahrenheit. The waves were a bit of a pain to get through (I had left my shorts on over my Speedos, for saving face &#8211; I ended up with a load of resistance), but swimming underwater was fairly easy. A couple minutes later, I had found Ali, Jess and Cindy floating on an innertube in the deep end. Then the waves stopped. There&#8217;s not much fun being in a wave pool without the waves, so we got out.</p>
<p>I returned to my seat and promptly dried off. Though the air temperature was twenty-three degrees Celsius , the wind had the ability of making you feel much cooler. Within five minutes of drying off, the first of several announcements were made, dealing with park closure. This was the twenty minute mark. At 18:00, the only ones left would be the performers in the Orange Blossom Festival.</p>
<p>J and I were determined to get on as many of the slides as possible, but only after general admission was kicked out. Every five minutes, another announcement was made. Next thing we knew, it was six o&#8217;clock, and the four hour party was beginning. For the past hour or so, the astro-turf area beside the wave pool (and our table) was being cleared for the dance. A few minutes after six, the music began.</p>
<p>J, Ali and I weren&#8217;t interested in dancing though, we were trying to find the on-ramp to the first ride. After a couple twists and turns, we found it and booted to the top. It was a fairly simple waterslide, with three bumps and a splash down pool. It was getting cool in the breeze, but we didn&#8217;t care too much, we were having too much fun. From the top, while were waiting our turn at the top, we could see the next ride we were destined on. It was a speed slide, with a six and a half story, 70 degree from the horizontal drop.</p>
<p>J was first in line, and shot down at a rapid speed, making a rather large sploosh! at the other end. Then it was my turn. I couldn&#8217;t get a lot of speed to start with, but I gained a lot very quickly. My face was enveloped in a spray of water, I could hardly see (so I closed my eyes) and I couldn&#8217;t breathe. I second or two later, I plunged into the pool at the bottom. The floor and walls of the pool were padded (probably to keep large people from killing themselves). Stothart appeared at the side, hoping to get a picture of us while going down, but missed getting Ali when she came down.</p>
<p>J and I were intent on the Kamikaze run (which actually had some unusual German name, Der Splat or something like that). Ali wasn&#8217;t so keen, so she returned to the table. J and I hauled off to the killer slide. It took us only a few seconds to find the ramp up, and jogged the six and a half stories in about two minutes (the ramp spiraled to the top).</p>
<p>Just underneath the suicide slide was another ride, but one I had never seen before. The two runs wrapped around each other like a corkscrew (riders had to wear helmets or risk getting knocked out). We almost got off at that point by accident, but then realized that we had to keep going up. Soon, we were at the top, at the highest point in the whole park.</p>
<p>And it was damn cold up there too. We could see the waterskiers in the lake next to us, Hil and Kathryn leaving our table at the far side of the wave pool, and a group of our people at the bottom with a camera. Chris Stratten was in charge of photos, Stothart was at the side to view.</p>
<p>Again, J went first, and I did my best to make him feel uncomfortable by asking questions like: &#8220;Has anyone been killed on this before? How &#8217;bout paralyzed? Severely maimed? Paper cut?&#8221; I don&#8217;t know how successful I was, for J was gone next time I looked. About five seconds later he slammed into the water-filled track, soaking passersby. Then it was my turn.</p>
<p>I sat down in the track, looking down the run. Yeah, it was high. There were people I knew I had no chance of getting on here (I could&#8217;ve gotten Chris, if he liked swimming). I had to wait a couple of minutes while the guy checked down the run. Finally, he gave me the okay, and I prepared for watery free-fall. As one plummets the drop, the must have their arms crossed on their chest, and their legs crossed. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why at first, but it made sense once I hit the bottom. It&#8217;s so that when someone gets killed, they&#8217;re already in a convenient position to bury them in.</p>
<p>I had to scream (actually, a very loud yell, I can&#8217;t scream anymore) while going down. I think I yelled &#8220;BANZAI!&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not certain, it might have been &#8220;COWABUNGA!&#8221;. According to Dick, one is traveling an average of seventy-two miles an hour (the metric equivalent is about 115 kilometres per hour). I thought it sounded a little far fetched when I first heard it, but when I landed in that pool, I realized that the number couldn&#8217;t have been that far off. IT HURT! But my God, did it rule!</p>
<p>When we had first run up the ramp for the slide, we had passed the tent area where dinner was to be served that night, and the lines were already moving. J and I have large appetites (though J&#8217;s is often much larger and more diverse), and we hadn&#8217;t eaten since lunch (which is usually long enough). Instead of whipping down another ride, we headed back to the table to retrieve some exterior clothing, and other people.</p>
<p>J, Ali and Hil disappeared first. Some more of us held back for a few moments, to give them a head start. Others waited even after Therese, Stuart, James, Linda, Chris, Cindy and I went for our food. After all, somebody had to watch our stuff. Dinner was basic: hot dogs, hamburgers, potato salad, baked beans (which Stuart and James had to get, despite Chris&#8217; and my pleas not to) and drinks. You could eat as much as you wanted, come back as many times as you wanted. I only went once, I believe in the &#8220;Screw Seconds, Get It All The First Time&#8221; method.</p>
<p>When we returned, only a few had ventured out onto the dance floor, I have a feeling that most people were still eating dinner. The food went fast, as did the drinks. Next thing I knew, Geoff appeared asking for takers in more rides. Stuart, James, Linda and I were such takers. I have never believed in the &#8220;wait a half hour after you eat&#8221; saying, and it seemed that the other four didn&#8217;t either. We were off in a moment.</p>
<p>We sprinted over to another set of slides. Three were slide that used special foam sleds on which the rider would shoot down the wet journey. The foam sleds were similar to the ones I was familiar with from Ontario Place in Toronto, but had the from curled up with plastic handles. A nice touch!</p>
<p>Taking our sleds, we hauled to the top of the ride, lined up and prepared for a shot down one of three slides (A, B and C). According to Geoff, slide A wasn&#8217;t worth it, you never got enough speed. I took slide C the first time &#8217;round. Again, the water was nice and warm, and in the twenty-three degree coolness, it was nice to have.</p>
<p>Most of that slide was full of turns, and not full of a lot of speed. When I did begin to pick some up, I was rapidly approaching the end of the journey. Suddenly, the ride straightened out and I accelerated towards the end. When I did hit the splash pool, I got a slight jump from the churning water where the slide hit the pool. I skidded a bit, then ran off to catch up with the others.</p>
<p>On my second turn around, I had to wait until the next slot after Geoff and Stuart had gone down, this time I was aiming for slide B. The B slide went right down the middle, and had a rather large straight section. I wanted some serious speed. So when my chance came, I gave myself a good boost and shot into the ride as quickly as possible. I rounded only a few turns before my speed began to increase dramatically. Again, the track straightened out, but the stretch was much longer than before. I whipped down to the end, hit the churning, and got a serious bounce. I was actually airborne for a moment or two, before sliding to the ladder.</p>
<p>Again, I raced out to catch up with the other four. This time, the sled went back, for we were heading for the innertube rides. Having to wait in line for a while (innertubes were scarce to say the least), we snagged five rings and rolled our way up to the top of the rise. We ended at a fork in the pathway. To the left was a set of two slides, to the right was a &#8220;white-water canyon&#8221; type ride. The first time, we went right.</p>
<p>The start of the slide was a ringed pool, which the five of us piled into. James, Stuart and Geoff went on one side, Linda and I on the other. There was an attendant at the end opposite to the end we entered at, ready to toss us down the first of several downhill plunges between pools. The five of us desperately tried to stay together, but only Linda and I were able to hold together until we landed in the next pool.</p>
<p>We glided through part of it, were pulled along by another attendant and tossed down the next embankment. The next pool had a small wave maker in it, James and I got caught in the backwash. We tried to paddle our way out, but the attendant there grabbed us and sent us down again. Stuart was unfortunate enough to be caught in the churning of water at the end of the slope, I came down feet first. I slammed into him, knocking the ring out from under him. The final slide got us going rather quickly, ending in the splash pool. At first I almost flipped over, by I was heavy enough and spread out enough to stay upright. Stuart couldn&#8217;t pull that off either, wiping out at the bottom.</p>
<p>We began our trek back up the rise, but turned to the left at the fork. This path took us slightly higher than the first one, and ended at slides like those with the sleds. Again was the circular pool, and two runs. I chose the one on the left, and a moment later, was tossed down. I found myself immediately in blackness. It was&#8230; uh, interesting (a little unnerving at first), but when I noticed the small lights at turns, became rather cool. When I whipped out of the run and hit the pool, I waited until I had glided over to the edge. Then I hopped out of the tube, tossed it to another person in line and waited for all of us to collect.</p>
<p>Our next target was a &#8220;ride&#8221; that was called Lazy River. First we wanted to see if we could get anyone else to come with us, and get innertubes. We had to cross the dance floor to get to our table, and the dance floor population had increased very dramatically in the twenty minutes or so that we were gone. No- one else was interested, so the five of us continued on. However, there were only three innertubes to begin with. As we left, Geoff and I spotted a could lying on the beach (there was a beach on our side of the lake). We ran up, snitch &#8217;em and took off before someone noticed.</p>
<p>The Lazy River is no more than a circular trench dug into the ground. The driving force is a strong current (one that makes it next to impossible to stand up in without falling over). Almost instantly, the five of us began to play tag. James was &#8220;it&#8221; first. It&#8217;s easy to run in the current, so long as you go with it. Stuart was nailed fairly soon afterwards. We only made one complete circuit of the river before we stopped. It just didn&#8217;t seem to have the luster we thought it would. So we sat back and made another rotation as a group, and ran into Ali Etherington. Linda and Ali clung together and rapped for a while, the four guys hopped out at the same place we got in. James wanted to wait for Linda to come back, so we fooled around in the current. That&#8217;s when I lost my balance in the current, and skinned my knees (the bottom was like sandpaper).</p>
<p>Linda reported back that she didn&#8217;t want to go on anymore rides, so the four of us continued on without her. Our first stop was to get helmets for the corkscrew ride that ran under (and next to) the Der Splat. The helmets are very simple, made of foam that encompass the head, except for the face. Again we charged up the ramp, but got off at the first gate. I went last again, the others got ahead of me in line.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to explain it, but I didn&#8217;t find it that good of a ride. For some reason, I either got fibreglass forced into my back or all the water left me rubbing on plastic (it hurt something fierce). I stopped less than two feet after getting to the other end. Geoff, James and Stuart laughed at me (of course), then we booted down from the landing zone.</p>
<p>Then it was back across to the ramp again &#8211; for the Der Splat. Geoff and I had already been on it, but wanted to go on it again. Once at the top (heaving from the jog), we realized how much the wind had picked up&#8230; it was cold! But we got a chance to make three girls a little nervous about the drop. One of the girls even asked the same questions I had asked the first time, except I think she meant them.</p>
<p>Yeah, I was last to shoot the slide of death, but it was worth it. I still managed to make a rather large splash at the other end, but I didn&#8217;t get as far as I had when J and I went the first time &#8217;round. Then came my final ride for the evening, the first slide I went on that day.</p>
<p>We raced down over to it, up it and down it. James and I went on the first go, Stuart and Geoff in the second. I got a bad start on mine, I could see James ahead of me. This time I went down on the other run of the ride, it wasn&#8217;t any different from the right side, &#8216;cept for the side you had to get out on. Geoff won his race against Stuart. Then the four of us hauled our butts back to the table to see if anyone else wanted to go on more rides. I didn&#8217;t, so I stopped there. James, Stuart and Geoff took of to parts unknown.</p>
<p>It was now dark out, and the dance floor was full. Most of the OT troupe was at our group of tables (those who weren&#8217;t were somewhere on the dance floor). Chris was not there anymore, he and his cowboy hat (bought at Ron Jon&#8217;s two days earlier) were out dancing, he wasn&#8217;t hard to spot. Chris Stratten, Dave Kaye and a few others were seated at one of our tables; Hil, Shawn, Cindy, Linda, and several others rotated from the dance floor to a ledge near the tables (the dance floor was recessed from the area our tables sat on).</p>
<p>Therese was seated at the table next to me, not looking all to happy. I&#8217;m one of those kinds of people who get concerned when one of their friends doesn&#8217;t look too pleased. I had noticed this earlier, but had left it alone for the time being. Therese didn&#8217;t look good at all. So naturally, I went over to see if there was anything I could do.</p>
<p>It turned out that the cinnamon rolls that Linda had brought earlier that morning had cocoa in them. Therese didn&#8217;t know this at first, and had eaten them. So? Therese has adverse reactions to cocoa, it doesn&#8217;t work too well in her (though Chris and I have our suspicions to whether or not it&#8217;s just psychological). Aside from the adverse reaction, she was fine, er, okay . So we talked a while, and I got some insight to her affliction. There are some simple rules to keep in mind when Therese has eaten cocoa:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t touch her. Her skin is extremely sensitized, and anyone touching her only makes her feel worse and worse. Stuart had to be told of this.</li>
<li>Make sure that people don&#8217;t keep asking why she&#8217;s asking so strange, make sure that you tell them. Therese gets annoyed when people keep asking her (understandable, everyone&#8217;s like that in one way or another), and that only makes her feel worse.</li>
<p>And the most important rule to remember:</p>
<li>DON&#8217;T FEED HER AFTER MIDNIGHT!</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, I followed these rules, and made sure that there wasn&#8217;t anything that she wanted. Stuart was still off (God only knew where), so someone had to make sure she was okay. Despite some shivering (part of the reaction), there was nothing that she needed. We talked for a while (something we do a lot of when we get the chance), during which I noticed two things that I found rather interesting.</p>
<p>First of all, Therese seems to lose a little rationality when under the influence of cocoa. Several times she joked about Stuart getting killed while waterskiing (why I don&#8217;t know, it caught me a little off guard). I found this a little disturbing, Therese found it quite humourous. It was also when I realized that Therese and I are inversely-psychically linked.</p>
<p>That probably doesn&#8217;t make a heap of sense eh? Let me explain. So I&#8217;ve noticed (which is easy when you&#8217;re The Observer!), whenever Therese is really happy and content, I&#8217;m depressed and morbid. This also works the other way too. It doesn&#8217;t always go that way, though it seems to most of the time. Now, as for why it happens, that I can&#8217;t tell you. I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea.</p>
<p>I whipped out my camera periodically to burst onto the dance floor, swoop in on a few group members, take a picture (laugh like a loony) and charge off the floor, leaving my prey wondering:</p>
<p>&#8220;What the hell was that? And who was that unmasked asshole anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>I did that twice, one time I nailed Jan, Hil, Cindy and Chris in full bounce (a proud shot considering how fast I took it). The second time I was trying to get Roser and Davidson (who were tall enough to stand over most of the people on the floor). However, they left just as I arrived. But Stothart was left behind. When the picture was developed, I noticed that she was dancing with what looked like a nude black man, and it wasn&#8217;t anyone we knew.</p>
<p>I took a few other shots around the table area, trying to get a few people into my pictures. I even got (get this!) Therese, Kathryn and Linda to not only smile, but to look directly at me when I took the picture. I intend to have it blown up and framed as a piece of history.</p>
<p><!--p&gt;The music that was played was loud, and mostly rap. It was one of those times that I knew someone would have liked to have been there, and that person was Jeff Grigat (who had previously done Kathryn wrong, something that Kathryn will not forgive him for, nor many of the people in our group including myself). He loves "mosches", as he calls them.&lt;/p--></p>
<p>The dj&#8217;s chose only fast paced, heavy beat dance music. I recognized only a few of the songs (most were Billboard Chart songs, and I haven&#8217;t listened to those in ages &#8211; I use Chris to keep me relatively up to date on descent songs). That night also proved to me that New Kids On The Block are not as popular as they&#8217;re made out to be&#8230; we didn&#8217;t hear one note of theirs.</p>
<p>Unlike many of the people in our area, I didn&#8217;t argue with the selection of music. I take pride in the fact that I can listen to almost anything, except NKOTB, which I abhor with every nerve within my body. I&#8217;d rather &#8220;dive into a swimming pool filled with double edged razor blades&#8221;, &#8220;get a million paper cuts on my face&#8221; or &#8220;eat shards of broken glass&#8221; than listen to that crap.</p>
<p>I sat there for the better part of about an hour, flowing as well to the music as possible without having to get up and dance. Periodically, Chris would come off the dance floor for a few minutes and talk with someone, before returning to his only form of physical exertion during the entire trip. Chris danced for roughly four hours straight. Chris dances hard.</p>
<p>Time ticked away oh so slowly. I&#8217;ll tell ya one thing, after dinner had passed, my mood had improved so much, I had hit a high point for the trip. Call it a hunch, but I think that a lot of people hit an emotional high at that dance (single people, definitely; dating, I&#8217;m not so sure).</p>
<p>There were few songs that really got our group to flood the floor (those who danced &#8211; Chris Stratten, Dave, Therese, Bird, myself and a few others abstained with all effort), and fewer still that got them all off. The most memorable was Ice, Ice Baby, which cleared them from the floor in a matter of seconds. Hil was in convulsions with the thought of dancing to it.</p>
<p>Without warning, J hit the ground. He didn&#8217;t fall or anything, he just wasn&#8217;t feeling well and lay down. Stothart thought that he had keeled over. Fortunately, he wasn&#8217;t that ill. We never really did find out what was up. When we got back to the hotel later that night, he spent an hour in the bathtub, but didn&#8217;t emerge feeling much better.</p>
<p>I had a rather embarrassing moment that night. While observing (something I&#8217;m rather good at), I accidentally looked directly at Shawn and Hil. Now this would normally not be so bad, except they were, uh, well, exchanging certain bodily fluids! When one catches sight of that, it can be slightly discomforting.</p>
<p>The evening went on like that for a while longer, until the big time hit, 22:30. The ball was over for our group of Cinderellas, our coach was going to become a pumpkin once more. Knowing that it was our last night for partying, we reluctantly worked our way out of the park. Dick was not waiting for us outside, but in a nearby parking lot (as he had told us earlier). Chris nearly screamed my ear out while we were leaving (I was listening to AC/DC and couldn&#8217;t hear anything), telling me to wait up.</p>
<p>Back on the bus, we took our positions in our padded seats in our respective locals. Chris and I stayed near the front, Stothart in front of me, Dave and Chris Stratten behind me. We waited for head count once again. Both Stothart and Dave were complaining about the lack of &#8220;real&#8221; music, not the synthesized and drum machined stuff that we&#8217;d been listening to for four hours. That&#8217;s when I produced my walkman, the Sting tape and the speakers. Three guesses what we listened to on the way back to the hotel!</p>
<p>The ride was one of the quietest we had during the time spent in Florida. People were worn out, sleeping (Stothart and I had a race to see who could take a picture of Chris sleeping first &#8211; I won), or just sitting. It was quiet enough for Stothart, Dave, Chris and I to listen to Sting.</p>
<p>When we arrived, it was almost midnight. No, it hadn&#8217;t taken that long to get back, but that night happened to be the one when we switched to daylight savings time. That meant we were going to lose an hour&#8217;s sleep that night, making the following day rather interesting. We had fifteen minutes before room check.</p>
<p>When we got back to the room, we began to pack. All my crap was forced into my suitcase, all my carry-on stuff was in my camera bag. By the time I was finished, I had a hernia sack instead of a suitcase. But I didn&#8217;t have any stray things, aside from my toiletries, and a change of clothes for the next day. At about 1:00, the lights went off, I was asleep by 1:30.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Third Supplemental</strong></p>
<p>Tonight was one of the best nights to date. Although I had serious been considering suicide (again &#8211; also another story) earlier today, as soon as I made a splash down in the wave pool, my spirits immediately picked up, and continued to do so for the rest of the evening. Therese and I must have an inverse psychic link. When the dance started, so did Chris. He spent most of the night on the dance floor.

		<p>A Dream&#8230;<br />
Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations; To boldly go where no-one has gone before.<br />
I sat comfortably in my pressure suit, looking forward, towards the cockpit. Actually, it would be upwards, considering that was the way we were pointed. The five of us, the crew of the Space Shuttle Enterprise, were about thirty seconds away from lift-off, and anxiety was filling my bladder at an uncontrolled pace .<br />
I could hear the countdown through the phones in my helmet, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get moving. I was finally going to be in the realm I had always wanted to visit. I was going to be completely weightless in no time at all. Ten minutes to the black vastness of space. A beep echoed in the cockpit, and a rumbling shook the entire craft.<br />
I could feel myself forced into the seat, rather harshly at that. I thought for a split second that my chair might give out and I might fall backwards. Three gees of force can do a lot to a human, the least of which is mild discomfort.<br />
I could feel the ship roll to its proper lifting position, and the acceleration to the stars continued. Another beeping echoed in the cockpit, but this one was not routine. The pilot tapped a gauge on the dash, then motioned something to our commander. The last thing I clearly remembered hearing was:<br />
Uh oh!<br />
Everything happened in slow motion. The craft shook more violently than before, I could feel metal ripping into metal. The pressure in the cabin rose at a rate that could only be described as fatal. The glass plate of my helmet shattered with the rise, ripping my face to shreds in less than a millisecond. I could hear the destruction following me in, I could feel intense heat with my exposed face. Then I saw the flames (. . . beep beep beep&#8230;)<br />
My eyes opened to hear the quiet beeping of James&#8217; alarm clock. We had unplugged J&#8217;s, the last thing we wanted was that infernal contraption going off first thing in the morning. Chris woke up beside me (which was a considerable change from the night before &#8211; he had missed Predator 2, falling asleep once in a chair, then moving to James and Stuart&#8217;s bed and doing the same thing again), but neither of us moved with any great speed.<br />
First thing that morning was to wear something relaxed for breakfast. The ladies downstairs were much more energetic in the morning, they were ready before us (as they were usually). Once we &#8220;men&#8221; were finished (not long after our female counterparts), we progressed to the Sizzler (all except Chris and Stuart, who were taking their time).<br />
We followed the general route, pay for your breakfast and then hog out. I don&#8217;t think there was anyone who did not go back for seconds. I stuck with eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes and hash browns myself (two or three helpings), a few others were slightly more inventive with their selections.<br />
For example, Hil had chocolate mousse and jello&#8230; mixed together. It may sound a little rude, but she ate it. Then J topped Hil with his &#8220;unusual selection of the day&#8221;&#8230; a soft taco. J is the only person I know of (aside from myself) who could eat something like that first thing in the morning. I was disgusted at the time, but afterwards I remembered some of the things I had eaten for breakfast in the past.<br />
Breakfast was fairly uneventful, aside from those two interesting choices of nourishment. Once I was finished, I vacated back to the room to prepare to be on the bus for 10:15. That was the day we were to perform at the Mercado Shopping Mall, which we had passed on the first day. This was not something I was looking forward to. I mean, this was the way Tiffany got her start!<br />
Given, performing in malls can be slightly degrading (I still remember an Elvis impersonator who played Trafalgar Village when I used to work at the Black&#8217;s Camera store &#8211; we were right next to the stage &#8211; I never saw something so lame, but the music was good), but we needed the practice as a group still.<br />
The rest of the guys didn&#8217;t take too long to finish, they arrived a few minutes after I did, and we began the quick task of changing. I was thinking well ahead. Unlike Chris, James and J, I had to perform only with the choir. This meant that for at least forty-five minutes, I would be doing nothing. I whipped on a pair of short under my dress pants.<br />
I then tossed a t-shirt into my carry-on bag, along with my walkman, earphones, running shoes, and most importantly, money for shopping. Then I grabbed my sister&#8217;s compact camera (which I had brought down so I didn&#8217;t have to bring my large 35mm Minolta everywhere), my shades and music, and headed on down to the bus.<br />
Along the way, I ran into Dick, and asked him if he had found Mr. Davidson&#8217;s camera (Davidson had a Minolta X-700, same series as my X-370, but either misplaced it or had it stolen) on his bus. He had not, and Davidson had asked the like of Dick as well. So far, Davidson was not doing well in the recovery of that camera (he never did find it).<br />
The instruments and electrical equipment (speakers, mikes, etc) had to be loaded onto the buses as well, but that didn&#8217;t take too long. Still, even if you only lug one monitor (as in speaker, not video output for computers), you&#8217;ll still manage to work up a sweat.<br />
The air conditioned bus was a relief from the heat, and it was only a little after 10:00. Our performance was scheduled for noon, and by then it was going to be a lot warmer. It was times like that I wished we could wear uniforms made of t-shirts and shorts.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40591.105</strong><br />
<em>Day 4</em><br />
Well, I fell asleep about a third of the way into Predator 2, Chris never woke up (at least not that I saw, anyway). Breakfast was a little unusual this morning, J ate a taco. Strange, very strange. We&#8217;re presently on the bus awaiting our departure for the Mercado Shopping Centre where we shall perform for their patrons (oh joy).
</p></blockquote>
<p>About twenty minutes later (following the same route we had traversed several times in the previous few days), we arrived in the rear lot of the Mercado. Dick pulled up next to the walkway, and we got a quick notice to stay on the bus. All except a select few (Sonny, Chris, Paul, Chris Stratten, Dave and myself), who were asked to move the instruments and equipment to the stage. When you are &#8220;asked&#8221; for such a task, it&#8217;s more like an indirect order&#8230; you can&#8217;t refuse.<br />
Before anyone moved though, Dick burst on to the p.a. system. This was one reason why I was so glad to have this guy as our driver. He told us to look around, if we had the time, and see what the place offered. But he also warned us not to buy anything, as the Mercado was overpriced. Dick then added that we could most likely find that same stuff at the Florida Mall for much less. That was one handy dude to have around.<br />
The six of us moved back out into the rising temperatures to haul stuff to the stage. This was not particularly nice, the heat was getting more intense by the minute, and being in your uniform only made the heat feel that much worse. It took us approximately another twenty minutes (maybe a half hour) to move everything to the centre court of the Mercado and get everything set up.<br />
At the centre, there was a tent erected, for the regular band that played there (I believe it was every Wednesday or something). In the tent rested the equipment that band used. We had to set up around it as we could neither move it or use any of it (the piano would have been welcome). At least the Wind Ensemble and the Jazz Bands wouldn&#8217;t need worry about the direct light on them. The choirs however, weren&#8217;t so lucky.<br />
The mall was set up in an unusual manner, when compared to other malls that is. There was the open centre court, where we were, and on two sides were sections of the mall. The mall itself resembled more of a labyrinth than a jewel of a capitalist regime. Some stores were located in non-contiguous, indoor, air conditioned areas; others were outside. Go figure, the guy who designed the place must&#8217;ve been stoned at the time.<br />
I had to cool off before choir warmed up their vocals, so I disappeared into one of the air conditioned sections immediately next to the court. There was a year-round Christmas store, an electronics store, an automobile oriented shop, gift store, arcade (Chris liked that), a couple other stores (can&#8217;t remember what) and a refreshment business. That was where I found a &#8220;medium&#8221; sized lemonade (after seeing American medium sizes, I know we&#8217;re getting ripped off up here). That definitely hit the spot.<br />
By the time I was finished, it was time to warm up (the temperature outside certainly helped). Now Chris was thirsty, but he had no money on him (it was on the bus), so I spotted him a buck for a lemonade. It got him in gear. As we grouped and waited for Stothart to lead us, I noticed some rather nasty skies in the distance, ones that foreboded rain. Naturally, I informed Stothart of my little observation. She didn&#8217;t worry about it, but it bothered me, I had no intention of getting wet.<br />
We continued on, our voices were stretched and prepped to their performance best (yeah, right!). In about five minutes, we were just about ready. Then Crewe stole the Wind Ensemble people to get their instruments warmed up for their section of the performance (even though Concert Choir, Jazz Choir, Jazz Ensemble and Jazz Combo were on before them).<br />
At noon exactly, we moved into our positions on the steps of the stage for our time in the spotlight, that being the sun, which was right over us. I opted not to wear my sunglasses (a really bad move &#8211; my eyes are very sensitive to bright light), so I spent the better part of fifteen minutes squinting my eyes. By the time the concert was over (at least for us), my eyes were killing me. Before we began though, I ran my compact up to Mrs. Norcross (who was watching), and asked if she could possibly take pictures.<br />
We started of with that all-time favorite, Ezekiel Saw The Wheel (one of my favorite songs, it was easy to learn, and the guys have thirty-five bars of &#8220;Wheel-in-a-wheel&#8221;), which was supposed to get us up and runnin&#8217;. Then a spirited rendition of True Colours, to which Chris and Ali Etherington had solos. Ali sounded a little nervous (understandable), Chris barely flinched at all. The rest of us sounded okay to me, but singing outdoors does have its disadvantages. The acoustics sucked.<br />
We finished with When The Saints Go Marching In. This was a song that the men did well (and liked) usually, but recently we were getting a tad annoyed at Stothart who kept telling us to sound &#8220;black&#8221;. For Chris, this was no difficult task. For the rest of us though, we hadn&#8217;t the slightest idea what we were supposed to sound like. We also had one other problem&#8230;<br />
Mrs. Lamoureux, our usual accompanist (piano), did not come with us. That&#8217;s where Jen Rumsey came into play (bad joke, not intentional). Jen did Ezekiel and True Colours, but couldn&#8217;t play Saints. So Mrs. Stothart did. So who conducted us? Right, Jen did. Now I&#8217;m not saying that Jen can&#8217;t conduct (she can do it a lot better than I could), but she did need some practice with the choir as a whole.<br />
Somehow, we managed to hold our own right up until the end. In practice, we usually got this part right. Up to that point in Florida, we had screwed it up. We did it again, the ending was fubared something fierce. Either the audience didn&#8217;t notice (which I doubt), or they were overly courteous (which I hope), for they still applauded. I immediately put my shades on once we had finished, and retreated to the shade. Stuart followed suit.<br />
Unfortunately for Chris, Hil, Therese, James, Kathryn, Cindy, Angie and J, they had to stay out in the sun to do their performance as Jazz Choir. I wanted to change, and then come back and watch, but the bus was not there (Dick had to go back to dispatch to pick something up).<br />
Now, the heat must&#8217;ve gotten to me at this point, for there is a hazy area in which I do not remember exactly what I did (man, I hate it when this happens &#8211; it only reaffirms my belief the God gave me a defective brain, and its warranty has to have expired by now). But I do remember running into Dick in the indoor section right next to the stage. I managed to convince him to open the bus for Stuart and I.<br />
Dick showed me how to open it, with a lever in the dash. Then he warned me not to touch any of the other buttons and whatnot, for I could unpark the bus and send it rolling into something. That would not have been good, so I made sure I knew exactly which switch.<br />
I changed to sneakers, t-shirt, shades, and Ron Jon cap (on backwards). Stuart was done almost as soon and the two of us warped back to the stage area to catch the end of Birdland, one of the Jazz Choir&#8217;s songs (Concert Choir could never do anything that complex and make it sound as good!). Once they were done, we all disappeared into the shade once again, where we found Linda (still in uniform).<br />
That&#8217;s when many of the choir realized that the bus had returned, and a large troupe of them headed for the bus (I had to follow, or they&#8217;d never get in), Chris and Linda being two of them. About half stopped at Bus Two, the rest for Bus One. Once inside, everyone (except me) changed into more comfortable clothes. Dick had wondered about us, why we couldn&#8217;t stand being in our uniforms (this was when I had talked him into letting me on the first time). Then I told him a Canadian joke, that it&#8217;s always cold in Canada and we&#8217;re not used to the heat (an out -and &#8211; out lie, but effective nonetheless).<br />
Now this was an interesting situation. Chris changed at the front of the bus, Linda and other females at the back &#8211; all at the same time. Mind you, Chris and I acted like the gentlemen we were (right!) and looked in the opposite direction. Something in the back of my mind (probably my partial schizophrenia) told me to look in a mirror, but willpower managed to overcome the urge.<br />
Chris really didn&#8217;t seem to care (after all, he did parade around in leopard-skin&#8230; uh, that&#8217;s another story I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll go into detail), he changed anyway. I wanted to get back to the stage before the Jazz Ensemble finished, I wanted a picture of that too. So I showed Chris which switch to pull (explaining that if he tagged any of the other switches, he might unpark the bus), then sprinted back to the stage.<br />
I made it back in time, and snapped off a shot. Then I went hunting for the people in the indoors. I found James and Stuart quickly enough, in the automobile store. They had found out that the store sells &#8220;license plates&#8221;, which are made from plastic, and you can have messages put on them. Stuart had one made that read &#8220;Zombie&#8221; (which for those of you who don&#8217;t know, is one of the license plate from the story Graveyard Shift ).<br />
James was going to have a plate that read &#8220;Station Wagon From Hell&#8221;, but couldn&#8217;t fit it into the one line and still have it make some sense. The attendant informed him that the message could be stretched to two lines. To prove it, she brought out a completed plate that read: Telahasteezy Hussein, which is Arabic for: Kiss My Ass Hussein. I liked that plate!<br />
James then disappeared to find Chris, to ask him about the idea. I left the store to see what else there was. The gift shop had all sorts of neat stuff, but I purchased nothing (though the Space Shuttle coin set would have been nice &#8211; I collect things like that). I quickly developed another nasty thirst and went over to the refreshment store to snatch another lemonade. That&#8217;s where I found Chris. I asked if I could bum a lemonade off him, but then he reminded me that he owed me for one, so we were squared off for that (though he still owes me sixty bucks!).<br />
We didn&#8217;t stray much further than a table in the shade. There wasn&#8217;t much at the mall, so we decided to take it easy. Soon, Jazz Combo had finished and Wind Ensemble began. I believe they played all three of their pieces, but I can&#8217;t remember (mind you, most of this section on the Mercado may be historically incorrect, as I said, my brain was being defective at the time). About halfway through the first piece, we went back into the mall and into the video arcade. Chris was soon engrossed in a game of video boxing.<br />
About twenty minutes or so later, I happened to take a look outside. Everything was gone, all the instruments and the equipment had been packed up and taken to the bus (oops!). Not long after, I was back outside, sitting at the table with Chris. The rest had taken off to other remote parts of the mall to see what other neat things there were. Chris and I talked about something (don&#8217;t ask me what it was), changing the subject every so often. When Davidson came by and sat down with us, the subject changed to video games. So we talked about all that fun stuff until the time we had to return to the bus.<br />
Most of the bus had returned by the time we arrived, but not everyone was there. Therese and Stuart were a little late, but the chaperones didn&#8217;t seem to care. James was showing off his newest piece in his Coca-Cola collection, namely a Coke watch he had gotten dirt cheap (some twit had marked the wrong price on it). I thought he did rather well considering most of the prices.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
Well, the Mercado scenario wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it would be, though the choir still managed to screw up &#8220;When The Saints Go Marching In&#8221;. Other than that, it went real well.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dick hit the road soon after, and we were booting for the Florida Mall. We had seen it before from the side as we were coming from the airport, so we really had no idea of just how large it was. I had heard through the grapevine that it was one of the largest malls in Florida. We had two and half hours to go through some two hundred stores. No problem, providing you knew what you were looking for. If you didn&#8217;t, well that would be problem.<br />
For some of us, it wasn&#8217;t too bad. Warren&#8217;s bus was going to leave early, so whoever was finished in two and a half hours could go with them. Those who needed more time could catch Dick about an hour later. I immediately opted for the first bus, I wanted to get back to the hotel. We were supposed to be doing something weird that night (go carting, mini-golfing or watching movies), but I wanted a little time to myself first.<br />
So when we arrived, I checked with Chris as to whether or not he was leaving on the early bus or not. He wasn&#8217;t, or so he told me. I was immediately by myself. Before leaving the Mercado, we were all given a map of the mall, but I hardly even looked at it. Instead, I hit the mall, and went full circuit, keeping all the stores on my left.<br />
Fortunately, the Florida Mall was all on one level, with no islands. It was basically one long hallway, which can be nice, but also a little boring. Being under the impression that the place was huge, I moved as quickly as possible. I really didn&#8217;t need to, that place wasn&#8217;t nearly as large as we were led to believe.<br />
I can&#8217;t remember every store I went in to, but I do remember the ones where I bought something. The first place of purchase for me was a music store. Before I left, I had two Iron Maiden CD&#8217;s, a Tesla CD and an Aerosmith CD. Think this is bad? This is nothing compared to J. He returned to the hotel later that afternoon with, get this, fourteen CD&#8217;s. J&#8217;s family doesn&#8217;t even have a CD player!<br />
I then started looking for Star Trek V, which I had been looking for ever since I got down there. Just a few stores down from the music store was, a video store (WHAT LUCK!). So I shot in there and scanned the whole place for it. I found the rack with Star Trek movies (WHAT A BONANZA!). But I didn&#8217;t see number five. So I checked with the clerk. He replied that they had been unable to get it for months (WHAT A BITCH!). So I left the store fuming over my failure. None of the other stores I checked in Florida had the movie in VHS, though two had it in Video 8 format.<br />
Then I started hunting for walkman speakers. I had some from a few years ago, but they had since been sacrificed to the electronics god, and turned into other useful (and useless) things. The next music store (which I was not pleased about finding, I found out I could have saved a couple bucks buying my CD&#8217;s there), revealed my speakers, a connecting pair manufactured by Sony, for $11.95. Not bad.<br />
The computer software is really cheap down there too, but I didn&#8217;t buy any (I can still get it cheaper up here &#8217;cause I work at a computer store &#8211; or I get copies of it). I took note of the packages I was going to have to get my hands on at one point or another.<br />
I must&#8217;ve gone from one end of the mall to the other about four or five times in the span of two and a half hours, buying things, looking around (showing strange things to the people I happened to run into from our group) and creating some general mayhem. My last purchase was the newest Calvin and Hobbes book, and an X-Men &#8220;novel&#8221;, which was a compilation of several comic books.<br />
As I was looking at it James, Therese, Linda and Stuart appeared from out of the blue. I showed the book to James (which was right over TMNT books, which I showed to Therese), thinking that he might buy it, seeing as he loved Wolverine (who is Canadian too, might I add). But James pointed out that Chris would want it more than he did. I agreed with that one, so I bought it for Chris (who was low on cash) as a gift. No real reason, just something I had to do. I had been feeling really generous for most of the trip, and had I given into the feeling, I would not only have been broke by that point, but probably in a heap of trouble for giving gifts to the wrong people for no reason.<br />
After the purchase, I booted up the mall to find Chris. I thought that it might be a little difficult considering the odds of Chris being in the main hall. I guess the odds were in my favour, I found him at the other end, about to disappear into a Kay-Bee toy store. I nailed him inside, I guess he liked the book. Now, knowing that Chris was not going to take the first bus, I should have taken the key from him. Did I? NOOOO. Why not? You&#8217;ve got a better chance of finding out why I didn&#8217;t ask him.<br />
Anyhoo, I walked (rather slowly) back to the entrance I had come in, I wanted to head back to the bus. Along the way, I bumped into Karl, who was also taking the first bus. The two of us compared our new purchases as we exited the mall and headed for the far end of the parking lot. We quickly realized that we were following Dick and Warren, &#8216;cept they were more interested in a very odd looking van, I thought it looked like a large hearse.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hearse after all, at least that&#8217;s what Dick and Warren said. It turned out to be a rather strange form of motor home, complete with kitchen, bed and bathroom. And we could see that from the outside. I have to admit, that was one slick piece of machinery.<br />
Karl and I followed Dick and Warren back to the buses, I got onto Dick&#8217;s to retrieve my stuff, then hopped over to Warren&#8217;s and found a seat near the back with Karl. This gave me a chance to check out my new speakers. Aside from the fact they sounded a little weak (which was understandable considering their size), they were pretty neat.<br />
Karl and I talked about this, that and the udder thing until Geoff Barrett and company came up the way. In a parking lot as big as that one, I could still see Geoff from a long distance, he has one of those rather distinct walking gaits. Geoff, Neil and Jen (I believe that was the complement) got on and took seats back with us.<br />
By that time, our two and a half hours had run out, as had our luck&#8230; it began teeming rain. Over the bus&#8217; CB radio a couple minutes later, we could hear that there was a major tie-up on the I-4 (the highway we would eventually have to go on), which was probably due to the weather. Warren shifted the bus into gear and booted around to the main entrance, where the rest of the early group was waiting, plus some.<br />
Chris came on the early bus after all. I had been carrying his X-Men book, Chris didn&#8217;t have a bag, and didn&#8217;t want to lose it. Emily also came, though she might have been with the early group to begin with. Davidson, Bird and maybe another chaperone or two got on as well, then we were on our way home.<br />
Before we even left the parking lot, Emily challenged Chris to a game of cards (I don&#8217;t know what game, though I suspect it was Flash). Chris has not yet turned a challenge down that has been presented to him, at least not that I know of. I didn&#8217;t pay any attention to the game, I was more interested in listening to AC/DC.<br />
By the time we had returned to the hotel, about a half hour later, the rain had stopped and the sun come out. Now it was not only hot, but humid. This is not a nice way to move around. Before leaving the bus for our room, the representatives of Bus Two made a presentation of some cash to Warren for his trouble. Everyone applauded, even those on Bus One.<br />
Once I was back to the room, I began to view with close scrutiny what I had purchased. I finally got a good look at my new CD&#8217;s, and then began to read Revenge Of The Baby Sat (The new Calvin and Hobbes book). It was then that I learned the true meaning of the word &#8220;FINE&#8221;. To most people, it means &#8220;agreeable, being in an okay condition.&#8221; To Aerosmith it means: &#8220;Fucked up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional&#8221;. I like Aerosmith&#8217;s definition better, I not only related to it, but it made more sense.<br />
I was not feeling well at that time, I was contemplating my activities for the next day or so. I knew that the following day was the day of the Orange Blossom Festival. That afternoon, we were supposed to go to Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild and have some totally awesome fun. That night, a barbeque and dance.<br />
When I first heard about the dance, I thought it was somewhere near our hotel. That meant I could stay back, and not go. I HATE dances, I avoid them whenever possible. When I found out it was at Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild, I was not at all pleased. I wanted to go to Wet &#8216;n&#8217; Wild, but I wanted to avoid the dance. This left me in an awkward position.<br />
This also left me feeling down right miserable. It would most likely mean that while everyone was partying, I was going to have to go off to some corner and sulk (or something to that effect) for about three or four hours. I really didn&#8217;t know what to expect.<br />
About a half hour later (while I was in the room hunting for something), Geoff came up wondering if he could borrow my frisbee. I tossed it to him, he marveled at the construction (I got it at Canada&#8217;s Wonderland for winning some game) and then tossed it back, inviting me (he had no-one else to play with).<br />
So we went down to the grassy area and tossed it around. Soon Neil appeared on the scene. Then Karl, another guy whose name I really didn&#8217;t know, and finally Jen. The six of us tossed it around as best we could for about ten minutes (almost tackling each other trying to get a hold of it) until someone mentioned playing frisbee football. This was a good idea.<br />
I booted up to our room (getting the key from Chris), grabbed my shoes and booted back down. Then began what has got to be one of the shortest games on record. Neil, Karl and myself were on one team; Geoff, Jen and this other guy on the other side. One goal was this post at one end, the other goal a tree at our end. Geoff&#8217;s side got the frisbee first (the other side, not mine).<br />
Then it was passed from side to side for about five minutes, with everyone dropping it, tossing, flipping it, knocking, falling over it, falling on it, and catching it. Then, at their end, Neil managed to toss the frisbee to me (who just happened to be standing right next to the goal post) and scored a goal, the only goal.<br />
We were just getting started into the next round when my frisbee shot to Karl was intercepted by Jen. I tried to rush her and get it back, but she tossed it to the dude-who-I-don&#8217;t-know. So I tried to knock it from his hand. I did, and both of us scrambled for it. I forgot to inform the others about a small crack in the frisbee, so when the two of us got a decent grip, it split in half, ending the game. I burst out laughing, don&#8217;t ask me why.<br />
By that time, most of us were really hot. I whipped up to the room (getting the key from Chris), changed into my bathing suit, and whipped down to the pool and plunged right in. The temptation to make a cannonball was enormous, but I make a big splash, and I didn&#8217;t want to get everyone wet. The water was a bit chilly, but most refreshing.<br />
I hopped to the side (noticing that some strange girl was watching me, for what reason I don&#8217;t know &#8211; HONEST!), tightened the string in my suit and tried to do some lengths. I didn&#8217;t get too far though, my bangs were so long I couldn&#8217;t see where I was going. So I gave up, dried off and went back to the room.<br />
By this time, the other bus had returned, and we would soon be heading out for dinner to be back in time for activities. Then disaster struck. I found out that curfew had been lowered to 21:00, instead of 23:00 or 23:30, because Dick had informed the others just how long it was going to take us to get there. This meant we were going to have to get up earlier. The night&#8217;s activities were prematurely canceled.<br />
So we slowed down to a crawl. There was no reason to hurry for dinner, we had a lot more time to get our food and get back. Half an hour later, we found out that curfew had been raised again, and we didn&#8217;t have to be back on the bus as early as we had been told. This also meant that the night&#8217;s activities had been reinstated to 22:00. It also meant we had about forty minutes to find dinner.<br />
Our group opted to skip minigolf and the go carts, and watch Dances With Wolves in the ladies&#8217; room (not as in washroom, but the room in which Therese, Linda, Kathryn, Hil and Ali were living for the five day stay) at 20:00. So we set out to find food. The first place on our mind was Morrison&#8217;s Cafeteria, in the Osceola Mall (the mall diagonal to our hotel).<br />
Along the way, James and Stuart took off to Walmart to return their defective waterguns. Therese, Linda, Kathryn and I quickly realized that the lineup was too long, we wouldn&#8217;t get out fast enough. The decision was made to find another place to eat. While Kathryn and Therese went to see if they could get us seating at either the Sizzler or Red Lobster, Linda and I went to find James and Stuart at Walmart.<br />
Sure enough, they were annoying the customer service clerk, demanding their $1.23 (whatever!) for their guns. Five minutes after Linda and I appeared, they had their money, and we were on our way. Linda suggested picking up some more Coke and Pepsi for the movie that night, but I mentioned that the chances of getting through all of it were slim.<br />
So we headed for the crosswalk to get to the other side (just like the chicken, HA! I KILL ME!) and find Therese, Kathryn and hopefully Chris (who should&#8217;ve joined them by now). As we walked up the parking lot, James and Stuart joked constantly (&#8220;That&#8217;s a fargin&#8217; trick question!&#8221;). Then Linda stopped without warning. Turning around, we saw Ali Etherington following up. I didn&#8217;t hear her, but Linda did. That gave me the creeps.<br />
Naturally, we invited Ali to join us for dinner, and she did. When we got to the other side, we immediately checked Red Lobster. The line was long, and we couldn&#8217;t see them. I hopped out to check at the Sizzler when I noticed Kathryn, Therese and Chris talking further down the sidewalk. I hopped back into the restaurant, pulled the others out and went down to Chris, Kathryn and Therese.<br />
They had zilch for luck, every place they had tried had long waiting list. Then, from across the road, a single sign stuck out like a lighthouse beam on a dark, foggy night. We had forgotten about Friendly&#8217;s. Stuart, Chris and James took off, across four lanes of traffic, to find out what the situation was. They had seats.<br />
Next, it was our turn. I for one was not up to running across the road, I didn&#8217;t feel like changing my profession to &#8220;road pancake&#8221; that night. Not only that, my hip was bothering me, making it difficult to walk (why it was doing that I have no idea). At first, we all walked down a ways (heading for the cross-walk), but when the road cleared, I was abandoned. So I made a quick hobble after my friends.<br />
Soon, we had two tables of four, side by side. Linda, James, Chris and I sat on one side; Therese, Kathryn, Stuart and Ali sat on the other. We immediately began to view our menus, trying to decide on what things we were going to munch on. I felt like a steak that night, but Friendly&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t have that sort of thing on their menu.<br />
While we waited for our orders to be taken, James and Chris tried to see who could get the Triangle Solitaire down to one peg. James was the only one who succeeded on our side (I think Kathryn pulled it off on the other, though I&#8217;m not 100% sure &#8211; call the day a write-off for my brain, it wasn&#8217;t working too well).<br />
Just about everyone at our table o&#8217; eight ended up with a SuperMelt (which is a special kind of sandwich). Call it a hunch, but this may have most likely been because there was a special on with the SuperMelts, you got a free sundae with the order. So when our waitress came, she got a rather heavy order.<br />
At first, she was going to put all our separate orders on one bill. From past experience however, we knew better. So Linda asked for separate bills. When this happened, the waitress muttered: &#8220;Just great!&#8221; under her breath as she retrieved seven more bills. Incidentally, this was how Friendly&#8217;s kept track of what you ordered, it was immediately scribbled down on one of these bills.<br />
I thought that our servant was going to be one of these people who were basically crabby most of the time, from what we had seen to that point, she fit the bill. Luckily for us, it was an act of sort, she turned out to be a lot like Dick, cracking jokes here and there.<br />
A few minutes after ordering, we had the drinks we had ordered, and I had my chicken soup (I had a craving for a lot to eat &#8211; I actually missed lunch!). Then Chris noticed that Emily was sitting not far from us. He tried to order a slice of lemon to Emily&#8217;s table, but without success. So he &#8220;borrowed&#8221; the slice that was in Linda&#8217;s iced tea.<br />
Chris sauntered over to Em&#8217;s table, and donate the citrus portion to Emily. Emily promptly picked it up, wound up, and let it fly at Chris. However, she should have used a toothpick, for she missed most horribly. Chris didn&#8217;t move a muscle. He burst out laughing, then returned to his seat.<br />
The comedy was not yet over. This was now James&#8217; turn in the spotlight of humility (not to be derogatory or anything &#8211; I&#8217;m not that cruel). James had picked up the Heinz&#8217;s ketchup bottle, and having noticed that there was water in the mixture, promptly shook it up to restore the condiment to its normal state. One other thing I should note &#8211; he had tightened the lid before (gee, could this be a hint?)<br />
Having finished that task, James promptly began to wing the bottle back and forth by the base. I think he may have pitched it a little too hard, for the lid came off. By this time, there was also a lot of ketchup near the top of the bottle, and the centrifugal force more or less emptied nearly a third of it (fortunately, Heinz makes thick ketchup).<br />
At first, all I saw was a large blob of red stuff on the table. Then I saw it on some of the special ads, the side of James&#8217; head and on the dessert list. Then it was reported to be on Chris&#8217; shirt and on his shorts (on his right side, I couldn&#8217;t see it at first). Chris had picked a bad day to wear all white. Not finished! James&#8217; nice fling had also landed a large blob of reconditioned tomato paste in the next booth up from us, not only on the seat but a large splat on the floor, looking much like the one under James and Linda.<br />
Now I&#8217;m finished, at least with the targets. Most of the ketchup was cleaned in short order. Even the seat in the next booth. However, before anything could be done about the floor, a family moved in to eat. James is one lucky person, the patron who sat above the ketchup blob was a three-foot tall kid whose feet never hit the ground. Slid in, slid out. It took Kathryn approximately, oh say, ten minutes or so to calm down and stop laughing. Kathryn, so I&#8217;ve noticed, laughs at strange things. When she sees something that is really funny, it&#8217;s almost impossible to get her to calm down (Kathryn giggles profusely when trying to suppress laughing).<br />
The waitress never saw this (thank God), but seemed to be puzzled when Kathryn kept giggling at James. Our meals arrived about ten minutes after 20:00, which meant it was too late to watch &#8220;Dances With Wolves&#8221;. So we took our time, there was no great rush for us. Although our SuperMelt sandwiches looked small, they were rather filling (must&#8217;ve been the bread).<br />
Linda had ordered a shot of onion rings (most of us had French fries with the SuperMelts), but few of us were crazy enough to have one when the were offered to us. Linda has a nasty habit of drowning these kinds of things in vinegar. When she was finished, there was a small pool of sludge from the vinegar. I was kind of surprised that she didn&#8217;t drink it.<br />
After our main course was finished, our foxy waitress returned again, to take orders for the sundaes. Remembering what chocolate does to me, and the fact that no amount of sugar could ever reverse my depression (yes, I was feeling a little blah that night), I had vanilla ice cream&#8230; with hot fudge and nuts (okay, so I can&#8217;t completely avoid the things I love).<br />
My sundae lasted all of about three minutes. I have freaked a few people out with my speed of eating ice cream (point in case: one night at the local Kelsey&#8217;s, eating a fudge fantasy with about half the table of over ten watching me). It didn&#8217;t take long for us to finished off our ice cream treats. We hopped up to the register to pay for our meals and proceeded out into the cool night air.<br />
Upon returning to the hotel, everyone split off in separate directions. We had about an hour and a half until curfew hit, so I did the only thing that came to mind&#8230; (assuming you haven&#8217;t already guessed) I sat out on the walkway listening to music. Yet I didn&#8217;t get into the music, as I usually did. Normally, I would let the sounds envelop me completely. I had to actually concentrate on them this time.<br />
I knew what it was, and I had but one option in order to keep myself from slipping any further into the pits of grief and despair. I had to renounce any and all hopes for relationships. I said &#8220;FUCK IT!&#8221; to the part of my psyche that always nags me about being single (&#8220;How many girls called you today?&#8230; &#8220;). It didn&#8217;t make me feel all that much better, but at least I could get into the music again.<br />
A little while after, Chris came up to the room (I was momentarily inside) with a look of shock. He looked at me, then dared me to guess what had happened. It seemed that Angie had just kissed him. At first I didn&#8217;t know what to make of it, then Chris added that the room he had just been in was playing Truth, Dare, Double Dare. Then I understood. Only I thought it seemed a weak dare. Heck, all the other times I&#8217;ve played (which incidentally can never be printed), we&#8217;ve gone well beyond that.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong><br />
The Florida Mall was large, but not as large as Square One. Nevertheless, I picked up a few good deals, not to mention a pair of walkman speakers. But even though I was in the States, I could not find Star Trek V movie, Vinx or the Was (Not Was) albums. What a bitch! I finally ventured out to dinner tonight (shortly after learning curfew had been bumped down to 21:00, then 22:00), it took us almost 45 minutes to find our meals &#8211; at Friendly&#8217;s. James made a ketchup bottle blow up, and Chris narrowly missed getting hit by a piece of lemon. I&#8217;ve finally said &#8220;fuck it&#8221; to relationships, I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where I no longer want one &#8211; period! As for the dance tomorrow night, I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; if I can help it!
</p></blockquote>
<p>I stayed like that up to roughly curfew (if what little memory I seem to have is correct), when I had to move back into the room. At 22:00, as James had mentioned earlier that day, HBO began their presentation of &#8220;I&#8217;m Gonna Get You Sucka!&#8221;, a black comedy &#8211; and I stress black. I think there&#8217;s only two or three whites in the whole film (one being Jan from the Brady Bunch).<br />
I had seen this movie before, and it was funny then. James found it whimsical (UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE MILLENNIA!), laughed his ass off for most of the movie. I can&#8217;t say that James was the only one laughing, the five of us were almost uncontrollable in a couple parts of the movie. But none so bad as when one of the main characters is in an argument with another lead character. One of them blurts:<br />
&#8220;Pardon fuckin&#8217; me!&#8221;<br />
We lost James for a couple of minutes, he couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. The rest of us tried to figure out what was so funny. It was said with such nonchalance, it completely caught us off guard.<br />
When the movie finally ended, we killed the lights and settled down for our last decent sleep in Florida. The next day was the reason we were there, to sing (and be merry) and hopefully win a few awards (another understatement &#8211; to be explained later on). Little did we know how much of a long day we had before us&#8230;<br />
Let me rephrase that. J and I tried to settle down for the night (J was the only successful one). Chris, Stuart and James were more interested in resurrecting Earl . At first, it was humourous, but the hilarity quickly changed to an annoyance. None of them would shut up, they just came up with more and more suggestions which seemed to get funnier and funnier (at least to them) as they went along. I made two suggestions to them.<br />
The first was early on, one that followed the same route that they were taking. It was a title for a movie, Bunny Trek II &#8211; The Wrath Of Earl. The next suggestion put an end to their discussion, right after James said that they should right some of their ideas down. I replied: &#8220;Good! Do it tomorrow morning!!&#8221; Then I got to sleep.</p>

		<p>A Dream&#8230;<br />
I sat alone, on an endless beach, the sun setting far away in the horizon. The sky was painted a myriad of hues of orange, red and yellow. The waves washed in slowly, creating the soothing swish that had lulled me to sleep as a child. From down the beach, I could see a lone figure, walking in my direction.<br />
The figure was female, though I couldn&#8217;t see her at all in the setting sun. As she drew closer, her features came into view. Her hair long and brown; body full figured; wearing a one-piece, solid black bathing suit. She looked familiar, yet totally strange. At once I knew her, and forgot her.<br />
She sat down next to me, and did not say a word. She just stared at me. I stared at her. Somehow, we were locked completely. She leaned closer, and whispered something in my ear. Then she rose from her seat, winked at me, and then walked into the distance.<br />
I felt unusually warm, actually, quite hot. That simple encounter had let loose every hormone in my body. My chest felt aflame. I looked down, and it was glowing red. I could feel fire licking up my throat, the intense heat cooking me from the inside out (&#8230; thou shalt not kill&#8230; ), smoke emanated from my mouth and nose (&#8230; thou shalt not lie&#8230; ), and then I was swooped up by a&#8230; VAMPIRE!?<br />
I opened my eyes and glanced towards the door. Yes, I was awake, and hearing The Lost Boys. I shifted my head to glance towards the television. Some idiot had left it on, and I was watching The Lost Boys. Before I made any action though, I checked to see if the others were awake. James, Stuart and J were all out like lights. I checked the clock, 5:03.<br />
Then I turned towards Chris. He was wide awake, watching the movie. This caught me slightly off guard, but then I remembered that he is prone to these things, pulling all-nighters for no apparent reason. He told me of two other movies he had seen earlier (which really sucked), and I went back to bed.<br />
When I re-awoke later that morning (somewhere between 6:00 and 7:00), Chris had shifted his position to the outside, where he had taken one of our chairs. Then we all got our butts in gear, getting ready to move out for breakfast (which I really needed again). Once the bulk of us were ready, we headed down to the Sizzler for breakfast.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t had a buffet breakfast for a long time, and this was a welcome change. This place had just about anything you could think of in the way of breakfast food, even some stuff that you couldn&#8217;t. After paying for the meal (all we could eat &#8211; J was the only one who ever really got his money&#8217;s worth), we raided the food area. I believe in the &#8220;don&#8217;t bother with the return trip &#8211; get it all the first time&#8221; method. So I basically heaped eggs, bacon, hash browns and a few other things onto my plate.<br />
Once I was finished, I waited a few minutes, then hauled my stuff up (it was getting close to 8:15, the time we had to be at the bus so we could leave) and headed out. The others weren&#8217;t far behind though, no-one wanted to eat too much that morning. The buses were there when I returned to the hotel, and so was Dick. Yes folks, the dude had returned!<br />
We boarded the buses and by about 8:30 or so, were ready to roll out. I sat alone that day, near the front of the bus. So long as we traveled on those Grey Line buses from the time we left Disney World until I arrived at home, I sat alone. It&#8217;s really hard to say whether or not it&#8217;s good being alone. It&#8217;s nice in the evening for me, but during the day, it ain&#8217;t so good.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40491.085<br />
</strong><br />
<em>Day 3</em><br />
Soon we will be on our way to Cape Kennedy, brings back memories of &#8220;Space, the final frontier&#8230; &#8220;, not that I&#8217;d forgotten them. Following that, we are supposed to head off to Cocoa Beach, I hope it warms up a lot!<br />
Chris was up all night watching movies on tv (HBO). At about 5 a.m. I entered the world of the awakened for a few moments when I heard parts of &#8220;The Lost Boys&#8221;.

<p>Then we began our long trek to the East coast of Florida. Being in Orlando can be neat (depending on where your hotel happens to be located &#8211; ours was no exactly in an &#8220;ideal&#8221; location), but it is a real pain the ass when you have to travel to either of the coasts. It&#8217;s a long trip, and just about nothing in between. And if you think I&#8217;m just guessing about Orlando to West coast to justify my point, we traveled it too!<br />
Anyway, I had purposely brought a few tapes with me to listen to, so I wouldn&#8217;t get bored. I remembered the trip vaguely from my first trip to Florida (eleven years ago), the Bee Line Express stood out in my mind, but the trip hadn&#8217;t seemed so long. Then again, I was sitting alone on the bus listening to music, not engaged in any conversation with anyone (aside from myself, being partially schizoid does have its advantages).<br />
I won&#8217;t bother recreating any of the events on the way to KSC (mainly because I don&#8217;t remember any &#8211; and if I did, there would be too many to tell and this would be real tedious), but somewhere around 10 to 10:15, we approached a rather long bridge across the Indian River. From the top, way off in the distance, I could see the immense structure known as the Vertical Assembly Building. I reached for a cassette sitting in my camera bag.</p>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t already recognized it, these are the first three lines to Space Oddity, by David Bowie. This is one of my favorite songs, for several reasons. Had I a copy of the Star Trek theme, I probably would have played that too. We soon found ourselves passing by unused (or replica) rockets from the early years of spaceflight. Canals on either side of the road quickly appeared, one with an alligator (Emily was almost instantly on that side to take a picture).<br />
Seconds later, we were turning into Spaceport USA&#8217;s parking lot. Dick pulled into a spot and we came to a halt. Then Beber got off the bus to smoke up (that long without nicotine must have been torture &#8211; poor soul!), Kathryn followed her. No, Kathryn does not smoke, no-one in our group did. We didn&#8217;t drink either for that matter. But please, do not call us &#8220;goodie-goodies&#8221;, it just does not fit our attitudes. The only reason Kathryn left the bus was that she gets motion sickness, and she needed some fresh air.<br />
Finally, after another long wait, our tour guide returned with instructions. We had to be at Loading Area &#8216;A&#8217; at 11:00 (which was in about 15-20 minutes), but we could go gift shopping or looking around until that time. Remembering that my sister wanted some dehydrated ice cream, I booted over to the gift shop following James and Stuart.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t remember the gift shop from the last time I was there, but it wouldn&#8217;t have helped anyway. After all, things usually change after eleven years. The place was crowded, yet the only thing in stock they seemed to be running out of was film. James and Stuart kept finding strange and unusual things, I found the ice cream (and strawberries and stew and&#8230;) but for the moment, didn&#8217;t buy anything.<br />
Instead, I donned my shades once more, and headed for the shuttle we had seen on the way in. At first, I thought it was the U.S.S. Enterprise (not the one from Star Trek, but the original prototype space shuttle they used for flight tests!), I found out it was the Ambassador, a replica. That was depressing. It wasn&#8217;t even real. But I took a picture of it anyway, I had to.<br />
Then I turned my attention to the forest of rockets that were all around me at that point. Some of them I knew from memory, a couple had their names printed right on them. I only took pictures of three rockets (not including the multiple shots of the segmented Saturn V we saw later on): an Atlas-Agena, the Ambassador, and a Saturn 1B rocket. That&#8217;s where I found Stothart. I went over to ask her a question about something (a men&#8217;s sectional if I remember correctly), and the two of us headed over to the Apollo Gantry.<br />
The Gantry looks much like the real one (for obvious reasons), and has an exact replica of the Apollo capsule at the other end. Stothart was almost shocked when she found out how little room the astronauts had to move around in. I wasn&#8217;t even fazed, mainly because I knew most of this stuff from my early years of grade school.<br />
By that point, our time was running out, and I proceeded to the loading area for our tour bus. The tour buses at KSC are really cool double deckers (I wish Oakville would adopt a couple for bus routes!), and a run by a company contracted by NASA to run tours, they&#8217;re not even government affiliated. Now that is most reassuring!<br />
Eventually, the group all arrived for the tour. At first, I thought we would have a bus to ourselves. I quickly noticed that even our two buses couldn&#8217;t fill this one. We had other people on our bus too, who weren&#8217;t with us. I honestly thought this would lead to confusion&#8230; it did.<br />
Our bus was soon loaded (Chris and I sat in the back seats of the upper level), and we headed out on the road. A semi- automated, pre-recorded speech soon came over the p.a. system (with periodic breaks by the driver) giving us the low-down on what we were seeing. I really didn&#8217;t know what to make of it myself, I had seen it before (at least, I think I did).<br />
Our first stop was at the Astronaut Training Center, now a tour stop. The first room of the building contained an actual Apollo capsule (with both Command Module and Service Module &#8211; mated) and the Lunar Module (also with both Descent and Ascent stages). This was somewhat interesting, but to me, was a rerun of facts I already knew. For others, it may have been interesting, but I didn&#8217;t bother to ask.<br />
Then we moved into the next room, which was a perfect mock- up of launch control. We were to witness the launch of Apollo 11 (one of those missions at any rate) from our balconies. It would have made more of an impact had there been people working the consoles though. Instead, we watched the progress on two large video screens.<br />
Here&#8217;s a funny thing I noticed that day. Ever since I first listened to Space Oddity that morning, I had felt unexplainably saddened. During the presentation, I nearly broke down in tears. As much as I dislike Americans (though there are some rather strong oppositions, such as Dick), the flights and plights of the astronauts seemed to get me rather upset. To this day, they still do.<br />
Following the presentation, it was back outside into the sweltering heat (which we hoped would hold out until we were at the beach) and onto a new bus. There was a weird rotation at the Center, our first bus was shifted to the end of the line, and we had to take the first bus in line, as we were all in group &#8216;A&#8217;. This time, Chris and I did not get in the top. We had to settle for the bottom, I was stuck with the aisle chair. This made taking pictures a little difficult (shooting through window glare isn&#8217;t easy).<br />
We turned a corner and for a little while, double backed on the route we had just taken. Then we turned up another road, and headed north, towards the VAB. About halfway up the road (which was about six miles long), the driver interrupted the pre-recorded speech and told us to look at the VAB, which we could now see. Then he told us we were still three miles away. It still looked huge.<br />
We shot right by it, and continued up the road. Some distance up, we turned down off the main route and down another, smaller, road. This took us to the runway at KSC. That&#8217;s no short runway, let me tell you. &#8216;Course, the shuttle has no reverse thrust when it lands, and the 747 that piggybacks the shuttle from California needs a longer runway as it&#8217;s much heavier with that thing on its back.<br />
We buzzed through that place (didn&#8217;t get off), and headed back out to the main road. Then we double backed on our route again. This time, we turned at the VAB (about where the Crawler was supposed to be, but our driver informed us that the recording was wrong that day, the Crawler was parked elsewhere). Again, we passed the VAB, again on our right side (the only side we passed it on). On the left, just for humour&#8217;s sake, were a line of liquid hydrogen railway cars, on which was printed:<br />
DO NOT HUMP<br />
I can&#8217;t help it, this has to be said! Any male stupid enough to hump one of them (and believe me there are those who are not only stupid enough, but desperate enough &#8211; fortunately I don&#8217;t know any) would get their dick frozen off. It&#8217;s crude, I know, but it&#8217;s also built into my genes, I can&#8217;t help it!<br />
<em><br />
[Ed. Note: It wasn&#8217;t until years later that I realised what this meant. It&#8217;s a railroading term. Basically, it means the car should never be sent through a hump yard (where trains are broken-up and reformed), as the impact of the car when it connects with another could cause an explosion.]</em><br />
ANYWAY, we followed the Crawlerway until we were a mile from Pad 39B, where Discovery was prepped for launch the following day (that cheesed me off, why couldn&#8217;t we go the day after and catch the launch?). That was where the other crawler was. PIT STOP! Most of the people on our bus piled off to take pictures. I took on of the crawler, one of the shuttle way off in the distance, another with Mr. Davidson&#8217;s telephoto lens (one of James with the telephoto lens), and one of Roser, Crewe, Bird and Davidson. Then I got back on the bus and sat down next to Chris.<br />
Chris is one of a small group of people who can fall asleep on buses. I hate sleeping on anything that moves on the road, but I too get very drowsy. But if you also remember, Chris was up all the night before, so this probably compounded the problem.<br />
After all had returned, we moved out once again, doubling back on the route. This time, we stopped just next to the VAB, and a segmented Saturn V rocket. I took a picture of the VAB, but it still looks unproportional. What I mean is, I need a person standing on some section of it to put it in perspective. I did that with the Saturn V though. I had Therese stand at the engine end. Why Therese? Be damned if I know, that&#8217;s how strangely my mind works. To use a euphemism, my right side of the brain didn&#8217;t know what my left was doing (or vice versa). Anyway, Therese only stood about one tenth to one eighth of the width of the base. I didn&#8217;t bother with height.<br />
I whipped around the rocket, taking pictures here and there, and was about to head back to the bus before I was blinded (I left my glasses in the bus) when I caught hold of a sign that gave all the specs for the rocket. The last line read:<br />
Explosive Potential: 453,600 kgs. (1,000,000 lbs.) of TNT.<br />
How&#8217;s that for a firecracker?<br />
Chris was still on the bus, seconds away from dropping off. People began to return, one by one until the bus&#8217; complement was full once more. Just before we left that area, the driver let us in on a couple facts on the VAB. Each of those stars on the American flag? Six feet tall. Each of the stripes could run one of the tour buses down the middle and still have nine inches on either side. Then he told us of an American Bald Eagle nest near the south entrance to KSC. According to the driver, it weighed some 43 pounds. We did see it, when Dick hauled us out to Cocoa Beach. That thing was huge.<br />
We returned to Spaceport not long after that, we had about fifteen minutes to do whatever before we had to go back to the bus. I was in need of film, and I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to be able to get any before we got to the beach. I made a beeline for the gift shop. I bought a shirt while I was there too, I liked the way it looked. It turned out that I didn&#8217;t need the film, I only used two rolls the entire time I was there.<br />
Upon returning to the bus, no-one had arrived. Roser showed up about a minute after myself, and opened the bus (I kept watch as to how he did it, for future reference). Dick was in Warren&#8217;s bus, and when he saw us get on ours, returned to get it started. Dick was never bothered with other people opening his bus, if he was her certainly never showed it.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
We just finished a somewhat interesting tour of KSC, I finally got a hold of a roll o&#8217; film (which I really needed). We&#8217;re due to boot out to Cocoa Beach soon &#8211; lunch, sun &amp; Ron Jon&#8217;s Surf Shop.
</p></blockquote>
<p>After a few stragglers finally made it back, Dick shifted the bus in gear, and headed back out to the main road. Dick had mentioned that he had made this trip several times, we had nothing to worry about. Warren managed to out drive Dick a little, but getting in front of us. I didn&#8217;t care, somewhere in the back of my mind I kept thinking that Warren was going to get them lost. He didn&#8217;t as it turned out.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t remember how far it was to Cocoa Beach from KSC, but we had to traverse most of Cape Kennedy before arriving in the town of Cocoa Beach. As soon as we saw the sign that announced our arrival, about half the bus immediately started scanning for the Ron Jon Surf Shop. We had made plans to go there long before the trip to Florida was even paid for. Mind you, plans were also made to go to Daytona Beach and the Hard Rock Cafe, but we didn&#8217;t get there.<br />
Turning corner after corner, Warren&#8217;s bus finally came into view pulling into a parking lot. From there, we could see the mondo huge waves makin&#8217; totally awesome surfing conditions. Bummer dude, I can&#8217;t use a board! Dick followed Warren in, and then beat him to a parking spot.<br />
Before we went anywhere, we checked out the location of Ron Jon&#8217;s. About a block away rose the sign, like a beacon to the temple of surfing worship, a light shining through the dimness that surrounds we Canadians, as it is so hard to surf on Lake Ontario.<br />
However, food took precedence. We were starving. Food will take precedence over just about anything, there is only one thing I can think of that would make me forget food. Just what is this one thing? Use your imagination, it ain&#8217;t too difficult to figure out!<br />
We zipped by the front of Ron Jon&#8217;s, but did not go in yet. First, we snagged lunch at the local Raunchy Ron&#8217;s. I&#8217;ll say one thing for America, their food is generally cheaper than in Canada. One good reason for moving! Although it took a while, we finally got our lunch. Then anticipation set in.<br />
It took us some time to get over to Ron Jon&#8217;s, we had to wait for a few people to get themselves all cleaned up (I shall neither mention name or sex). Chris and I stood out front with Janet Bachelor, just staring at the shrine that lay across the road diagonally from us. Jan kept Chris and I from kneeling down and praying to the place, she couldn&#8217;t understand all the fuss we were making (as young minds seldom do).<br />
About ten minutes later, our chance with destiny had arrived, we were standing in the doorway of heaven on Earth. We reveled in the glory, then made a break for the clothes. I&#8217;m not sure how long we actually spent in there, the opulence made time completely meaningless to us.<br />
James had his heart set on one particular shirt, but could not find it anywhere. His hopes and dreams were dashed on the rocks of suffering, thwarted by some stupid manager who thought the shirt was out of style. Somewhere, someone was having a cruel laugh.<br />
Everyone was everywhere in that place. Somewhere in the span of two hours (give or take fifteen minutes), I ended up with two shirts (one for my sister), a pull over, keychain and hat. This stuff alone came out to $64. But it was $64 of pleasure, and I loved every penny of it!<br />
Finally Linda, Jan and I had enough (for now), and wanted to get to the beach before the sun set (or we had to leave, whichever came first). I needed to make a quick stop at the bus to drop my newly bought booty off, and head off only with the bare necessities (towel, camera, shoes, shorts and t-shirt).<br />
This is where my abilities as The Observer came in. Remembering what Mr. Roser had done earlier (Dick was not around, nor was Warren), I went to the fuel hatch near the door. Opening it, I peered inside to see what Roser had pushed. Sure enough, a small silver button lay just to the side of the fuel cap. To myself I thought: &#8220;This is either a self destruct button, or it opens the door!&#8221;<br />
I pressed it anyway, and a swishing opening of the door let me know that it was not a self destruct button. The three of us climbed in, only to realize that it was Bus Two, not Bus One. We got back out, I closed the door and went to the bus immediately next to it. I opened the door to that one, and this time got it right. Two minutes later, we were on the beach.<br />
Five minutes following that, I was working my way into the Atlantic Ocean. My Speedo must have adjusted to me once again (I had been wearing them all day), for I received no shock from them. The water took a bit to get used to, but then it was COWABUNGA DUDES!<br />
Several people from our group were out there (Jen, Neil, Geoff, Kara, etc.), most of us were trying to body surf, only most of them were too far out and catching the wave wrong. I hadn&#8217;t body surfed in about five years, but it&#8217;s like riding a bicycle (not only don&#8217;t you forget, but you wipe out a lot too).<br />
Half an hour and ten kilos of salt later, I emerged from the ocean to find only a couple people in the group I had sat down with left. Chris and James had still not appeared, they were taking their sweet time. So for a little while, I took time out to dry off.<br />
Chris and James appeared not long after I was mostly dry (not mostly dead Hil, mostly dry!), having come from one end of the beach, making sure they took long, hard looks at people sunning on the beach, just to make sure they weren&#8217;t in our group. I wished I had hung behind and gone with them.<br />
I decided almost immediately after that it was time to take a few pictures. I whipped out my camera and began my hunt. I got one of Chris; one of Chris Stratten, Paul and Andy; one of Hil and Shawn (boyfriend and girlfriend by this point incidentally); one of Roser flat out on his back with his shirt still on (the guy must not be able to relax!); Davidson fell victim to my shutter too. Once I returned to my towel (and friends), I took a picture of Linda, about two feet from her head. When she saw the photo later on, she hated it, but I knew that if I had asked, I never would have been able to take the picture.<br />
Then came the two hardest photos I have ever taken. Kathryn is the hardest person I know to take a picture of. Every time she sees a camera, she hides her face. I don&#8217;t know why, she looks rather pretty to me. This took careful planning. I focused on her body with the camera up, the dropped it and waited for her to look up. Then I took the picture. I&#8217;m surprised that she didn&#8217;t want to kill me.<br />
Finally, was Therese. Stuart was out cold, so I didn&#8217;t want to bother him. Therese was almost as bad. But once again, bullshit paid off. The angle I was taking the picture at almost had the sun right behind Therese, looking not quite down the lens. So I explained to Therese that she would simply turn out as a silhouette. This wasn&#8217;t entirely true, there was too much light for that, and the angle didn&#8217;t have the sun coming straight on. The image I ended up with made me feel like a good photographer, even though it was the wind that made Therese look so &#8220;modelish&#8221; in the picture.<br />
Immediately, I took the camera back to the bus, before it was irreparably damaged by sand (even though, I still managed to get something in the camera, a couple parts got gummed up with something). When I returned, most of the female population had disappeared. They had gone for a walk down the beach. It was then I noticed for myself that it was getting a little cool. Not only a little, but increasingly cooler. This made the humidity stick to us like glue, making us feel rather sticky.<br />
I only spent about another fifteen minutes on the beach before I went back to the bus to get out of the coolness and stickiness, it was too much for me. Several other people had already concocted the same idea, and were already on the bus. Warren&#8217;s nap was unfortunately interrupted, he retreated back to his own bus.<br />
I looked out my window, back towards the beach, waiting for the women to return. I needed to talk to Therese about a particular someone, and preferably before the bus left (and Stuart came back, and I say this only because I don&#8217;t want to make him mad at me for talking to Therese about things like that). When I did finally catch sight of the missing females, I booted out to the beach before Therese disappeared again.<br />
Before I got much out, she had me viewing her seashell collection. Only three of the bunch were in perfect condition. Therese liked shells with deformities (she&#8217;s weird like that), and most of them did have something odd about them.<br />
I got my request in, and she agreed to hear me out. This was nothing to do with Therese herself, but I had to ask her. Why? Several reasons. I was asking about one particular female on the trip, and I knew that Therese was a good person to ask for information (I knew this from long talks long before the trip ever began). I was informed that asking out this particular person was not a wise idea at that point in time. I could feel my heart slip a notch, I needed someone to care for then.<br />
So I returned to the bus in defeat, taking my seat, brushing the sand from my feet (HEY! I&#8217;m a poet, and don&#8217;t know it!). About five minutes later, the population of the bus had returned to its normal number, the head count made, and we rolled out. It was now somewhere around 18:00, and the sun was setting quickly. It would be dark before we got back to the hotel.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong><br />
It&#8217;s not easy to be an unbiased observer, as I was in the Soviet Union, when you&#8217;re emotionally hung up. The Ron Jon Surf Shop was unofficially declared a shrine of worship by Chris and I. The beach was dotted with groups of our people, most of the women wearing rather skimpy outfits (one reason I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m single &#8211; actually, it&#8217;s the only reason).
</p></blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before Dick hit the highway and put the accelerator to the floor. The signs on the highway read a maximum of sixty-five miles an hour, but I&#8217;ll be a march hare in a den of hungry wolves if we actually did sixty-five, probably more like seventy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HELLS BELLS!<br />
YOU GOT ME RINGING&#8230;<br />
HELLS BELLS!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I listened almost solely to one tape while in Florida. One side was a compilation of the AC/DC albums &#8220;Who Made Who&#8221; and &#8220;The Razor&#8217;s Edge&#8221;. The other side was Sting&#8217;s newest album, &#8220;The Soul Cages&#8221;. I really love that album, Sting did a wicked job on it. Anyway, I was listening to AC/DC on the way back to the hotel, so I could stay awake (which doesn&#8217;t always work, even that seems to make me drowsy &#8211; go figure!).<br />
About forty-five minutes or so later (and a substantial distance from Bus Two), we pulled into the parking lot of our Days Inn. We booted up to our room o&#8217; five, returned the stuff we had brought with us that day, and picked up stuff we needed for dinner (like money!). Then we headed out for some grub.<br />
I picked either a bad night or a bad time, for I only made it as far as the Red Lobster just down the road. When we arrived, the place was packed, and there was a forty minute wait for a table. I lost my appetite at that point, I didn&#8217;t feel like eating. The others tried to get me to come, but I had to turn them down, I really didn&#8217;t feel sociable at that point.<br />
I returned to the hotel room, passing Chris and James along the way (they had been taking their time) and got the key. Once I was there, I checked the time (we had a men&#8217;s sectional at 21:00, so I wanted to make sure I didn&#8217;t go too long listening to music), grabbed a chair and my walkman. Then I took my place out on the balcony and listened to music. It was then I noticed that the room beside us had suddenly lost its vacant status.<br />
We had neighbours, and they weren&#8217;t from our group. This meant that we had to keep our activities down to a dull roar, so we wouldn&#8217;t have any complaints (not that we hadn&#8217;t received any already &#8211; we could be really noisy). The rooms were soundproof enough, but the walkways weren&#8217;t.<br />
I paid no attention to them, I was more interested in relaxing. Sitting there, listening to the dulcet tones of The Soul Cages in a cool Florida breeze is a very peaceful way of relaxing. I had first discovered this technique when I was in the Soviet Union, but had not the chance to use it since. I hadn&#8217;t felt that relaxed in a long time.<br />
I sat there for about an hour, until 20:55 rolled around. Stupid me, I thought Stothart would be back from dinner by now for the sectional. I think I trust her too much. She had not yet returned. I waited there a moment or two, then went up to the second floor, walked to the building break (a small passageway between the two hotel room blocks) to see if anyone was returning from dinner. A few from my room were appearing, and I could hear Stothart just off in the distance (across the road).<br />
At 21:10, the DX-7 and an amp had been moved into Stothart&#8217;s room (#135 if my memory serves me correctly), and the &#8220;men&#8221; began to appear. Mind you, not all were men. Because some of the tenors (and three basses &#8211; not that it mattered anyway) were unable to come to Florida, Stothart created the female tenor section. This was made of Jessica Wallace, Cindy Merson (and sometimes Hil). The only other tenor present at that sectional was James. Ryan had disappeared somewhere.<br />
As for basses, J was at dinner with his grandparents (a legitimate excuse, for once), which left Chris, Stuart and myself as the usual basses who were on the trip. So once again, Stothart recruited more singers. However, there were no females that could sing as low as we had to, so she nailed Paul and Dave. Stuart and I were almost on our own for True Colours, Chris had a solo to do (which he did really well &#8211; I envy his voice!). Dave and Paul could read music, Stuart and I could not.<br />
We spent about an hour and a half going over trouble spots (yes, the men caused a lot of havoc in our three songs &#8211; we managed to screw up a lot, as most of us couldn&#8217;t read music) before we were satisfied with the results. I personally thought that the entire choir should practice, we did need the work, but there was no way to cram us all into one room, and something told me that the hotel management wouldn&#8217;t take kindly to us practicing that late at night outside.<br />
So we broke from practice, I and whipped back up to the room for my walkman. Then I was confronted with the question of my life &#8211; did I want to watch Predator 2 at midnight? It came on the pay-tv channel. Seeing as we didn&#8217;t have to be at the bus until 10:30 the next morning, I thought: &#8220;What the hell, why not?&#8221;<br />
James and Stuart booted down to the front desk to put in a deposit of $25 (for what, I have no idea!) to make sure we could watch the movie. I grabbed my walkman, rewound the tape a few songs, and retreated to the grassy area between parking lots. The walkways had become too noisy by this time, and I could sink into the music.<br />
I didn&#8217;t listen too long before it came too difficult to listen to. I have found that listening to certain songs under particular conditions really make you feel rather nasty, and I just wasn&#8217;t up to feeling nasty at that point. So I headed back to the room. I ran into Linda on the way up (not literally, she just didn&#8217;t want to go in the room), so we sat down and talked a while.<br />
I&#8217;ll say one thing for Linda, she loves to know how your love life is going. It started when I asked Linda why she wasn&#8217;t in her room. That was &#8217;cause Shawn and Hil were in there (common courtesy to not enter like that). I knew where J and Ali were (our room), and I knew where Stuart and Therese were (though I can&#8217;t remember now). This left me with Kathryn, and I was genuinely interested (but keeping in mind a recently learned fact), so I asked where she was.<br />
This piqued Linda&#8217;s curiosity something fierce. So I answered just as genuinely as my curiosity. This lead Linda to another question: &#8220;I thought you were interested in Danica!&#8221;<br />
What would you do if you were asked a question like this, knowing who you were about to answer to, also knowing that your best friend has the hots for the same person? Right, you lie your ass off! This is something I can do rather well on the spur of the moment, it&#8217;s kept me out of several uncomfortable situations.<br />
So I answered with about the best fib I had ever concocted. I told Linda that the only reason I was ever interested in Danica was because I had found someone who was more of an enigma to me than myself, and believe me, Danica is strange (no offense Dan!).<br />
Now, you must be wondering why I did that. I had good reason. The last time I was interested in &#8220;that way&#8221; with someone (who also happened to be in the same family), I was defeated in my attempt. This defeat almost turned me against one of my best friends, who I had known for some time (fortunately, the situation has since subsided and we are back to normal, almost). This was not something I wanted to go through with Chris, he&#8217;s one of the last people I ever want to lose as a friend.<br />
During our talk (which lasted quite a while, I don&#8217;t know how long), I offered Linda one of our Pepsis (I was feeling rather thirsty), she perked up somewhat at the offer. She loves Pepsi. As I was about to enter our room, I saw J and Ali (on Chris&#8217; and my bed too!) doing whatever (sorry, no detail here!). So, I closed my eyes (hand clamped over top), and walked through the room blindfolded. This was not easy, I was surprised I didn&#8217;t trip over anything, but I did bump into the counter at the back of the room.<br />
The cans were ice cold, but Linda didn&#8217;t drink too much. We continued chatting until about lights-out (somewhere in that vicinity), and we had to return to our respective rooms. This gave me my first chance to boot someone from our room. Ali had gotten the picture via one of the chaperones, and passed me on my way up (not that I disliked her or anything, I was just feeling a little vicious &#8211; nothing serious).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Third Supplemental</strong><br />
We creamed the other bus getting back, Dick (our totally bitchin&#8217; driver) drove like the blue tails of hell. I had a shower, removed the crap from my hair. At first I headed for dinner, then backed out when we couldn&#8217;t get a table at the Red Lobster. Instead, I went back to the hotel &amp; listened to Sting until men&#8217;s sectional at 21:10. That went fairly well. Chances with K? Up in the air at this point. At midnite, we see Predator 2, we don&#8217;t have to be at the bus until 10:30.</p></blockquote>
<p>At midnight, on came Predator 2. This was the third time for me, I had seen it twice back in Oakville. The picture was a little fuzzy, but was good enough for our purposes. A strange thing beset itself upon me, about a third of the way into the movie. I fell asleep.</p>

		<p>A Dream&#8230;<br />
The choir was set, standing on a stage in a rather large auditorium. Four bright lights shone on us, one on Paul and Dave Kaye on one side, a sixth light on Shawn and Andy on the other. The audience was immense, and deathly quiet. Stothart walked to the front of the stage, stood on her podium and faced the audience, saying something we couldn&#8217;t hear. Then she turned to us, raised her arms, and the music began.<br />
Paul and Dave strummed off a few chords on their guitars, echoing into the black depths of the room. They held the last note for a few seconds, before Shawn let off a blast on the drums. Paul was a solo from that point for a while, blaring away at a tune I knew, but did not remember practicing for the choir. Then James, Chris and myself began to sing, or rather, shout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean!<br />
She was the best damn woman that I&#8217;ve ever seen!<br />
She had a-thankless eyes, tellin&#8217; me no lies!<br />
Knockin&#8217; me out with those American thighs!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Then Dave kicked in with his guitar, playing the same notes as Paul. The rest of the basses and tenors also picked up at this point to assist us. Stothart was going wild, as was the audience.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a moment to share, had me fightin&#8217; for air!<br />
She told me to come, but I was already there!<br />
&#8216;Cause the wall start shakin&#8217;, the Earth was quakin&#8217;,<br />
My mind was achin&#8217;, and we were makin&#8217; with you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Now the sopranos and the altos came in for the chorus.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG!<br />
Yeah you!<br />
SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Beep, beep, beep, beep&#8230;)<br />
I realized with a start that the audience was exiting the building quickly, the fire alarm had gone off. The choir took that moment to also vacant the premises. But I couldn&#8217;t move, my feet were stuck to the bench, I was immobile. The doors on either side of me suddenly burst in, fire leaping across the stage. It came closer and closer, I could feel the intense heat; I could still hear the fire alarm. But it didn&#8217;t sound like a fire alarm.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a fire alarm, it was a dream. What I was hearing was J&#8217;s stupid alarm clock at 6:30 in the morning. J wanted to go jogging with a couple of the chaperones. To put it bluntly, we wanted to kill him for that stupid clock, it was too loud. If you want an approximate level of noise, think of a foghorn built into an alarm clock, and you&#8217;re getting close.<br />
J was the only one who really moved at all, the other four of us were too worn out to move at any speed at all. Even though I had gone to bed long before the others, I was still tired. So we waited for James&#8217; alarm to go off. We had two clocks in our room, the women had my clock (though I don&#8217;t know if they ever used it &#8211; I assume they did, as they did ask for it).<br />
When James&#8217; clock went off, we began to move, though not very quickly. It was now only 7:30, we had to be back for the buses at 9:00. One by one, we hauled ourselves from the beds. J&#8217;s mattress was in between the double beds. James and Stuart were the first to rise after J, they still had to have showers. Chris had one the night before, I wasn&#8217;t going to have one until later (I like to conserve water).<br />
J never returned, and if he did, he made his entry very brief. James, Chris and I were the first ones ready to head out for breakfast (which I really, really needed), Stuart was taking his time. So we told Stuart that we were heading out ahead of him. When we checked in with the ladies, only Linda and Therese were left, and they weren&#8217;t ready yet either. So we headed out without them, but we told them where we were going.<br />
We soon arrived at the Friendly&#8217;s Restaurant across the street, noticing their $2.22 special: two eggs (any style), two pancakes, two sausages (or bacon). The three of us decided that this was a good deal. We had a seat in almost no time at all. And we found out where the rest of our missing females and J were, eating at the table behind us.<br />
James, Chris and I all ordered the special, but with slightly different variations. James wanted his eggs fried sunny side up, Chris and I wanted them scrambled. James had apple juice, Chris grapefruit juice, and I orange. And let me tell you, the waitress that we had serving us was by far the most pleasurable person I had ever met first thing in the morning. She had to have been a morning person.<br />
Stuart, Therese and Linda showed up not long after that, but they didn&#8217;t stay. Instead, they booted off to another restaurant (Sizzlers, I think). James and Chris entertained themselves with Triangle Solitaire. To put it simply, it&#8217;s a wooden board with a triangle superimposed on the surface, with three small triangles at each of the three corners. The area enclosed by the triangles have a bunch of holes drilled in them (can&#8217;t remember how many, somewhere around twenty or so) where white pegs go. There is one more hole than there are pegs. The whole idea is to be able to jump all the pegs until there is just one left. Neither Chris or James could do better than three. I couldn&#8217;t even do that well, I could only end up with five.<br />
After we were finished, we booted back to the hotel to get our load of stuff that we were going to need to survive the day. This included money, shades (a necessity due to the light &#8211; Chris had left his in his locker at school), cameras (those of us who had them) and for me, tunes (gotta have those!). By that time, it was quarter to nine, the time we had been asked to arrive at the buses so we wouldn&#8217;t waste any time. No-one in our room moved with any great expediency.<br />
From our room on the third floor, overlooking the parking lot where the buses were parked, I could see that only Warren had returned. Much to our misfortune, Dick had not arrived that day to drive us around. I was dismayed, but reminded that this was life, and the expected never happens (at least not always). Soon, we booted down, and checked in with Stothart. Next, it was onto our bus.<br />
At first, I aimed for the back of the bus (I always loved riding back there, it was almost my home when I traveled through the Soviet Union ). But before I had barely even taken my seat, I was beckoned by Chris to come forward. However, he had neglected to tell me that there were any seats available. Kathryn (bless her soul) was kind enough to let me sit with her. Before the bus even moved anywhere though, she asked to shift to the aisle seat, as she was prone to motion sickness. No arguments from me!<br />
Then our new driver got the ol&#8217; bus in motion, heading for the same road that we had come up the day before. After we cut off a couple lanes of traffic, we headed on down, following much the same route that we had followed the day before, except when we arrived at the intersection where I had received that wicked case of deja vu, we did turn left (into the direction had we gone straight through) and headed for Disney World.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take too long to spot some of the larger exhibits, the first ones came from what we thought to be MGM Studios, but we couldn&#8217;t tell (I don&#8217;t think it was, we passed it later on that day on the way out). Soon, we passed by Epcot Center (one of our two destinations) and continued along the Disney Highway System.<br />
Before long, we arrived at a large parking lot, solely for buses. This was one of several Disney Bus stops (where people could take buses to the separate divisions of Disney World), but also where the buses from coach lines stopped for unloading into Disney World. This is where our group pulled in. Then we had to wait for about forty-five minutes for our tour guide to finally get all the flippin&#8217; tickets. At least the Epcot people would get in quickly (the bastards!).<br />
Somewhere around 11:30 or so, we entered the world that Walt built (though he never saw it completed before his death), and headed right for the monorail. The ride was one that brought back memories for me, especially when the train traveled right through the middle of the Contemporary Resort Hotel. It was where my family had stayed eleven years ago, the feeling was somewhat overwhelming.<br />
Soon, we arrived at the station for the Magic Kingdom, and we couldn&#8217;t wait to get inside. However, a little voice which had been nagging me since before we left kept repeating: &#8220;The place is jammed, we should have come earlier!&#8221; Of course, that damn voice was right, the place was jammed. We didn&#8217;t care, we were in the land where the dreams of millions of little children come true every year, where people of all ages can live out their childhood stories by traveling through the many rides and displays that encompassed the realm of Disney. And if you weren&#8217;t into that, you could always go around mauling the people in the character suits.<br />
Halfway up Main Street USA, our group split in two, there were too many people to do anything productive. James, Linda, Therese, Stuart and Kathryn took off in one direction; Chris, Ali Etherington, Emily Patrick and myself in the other. I wanted to be with Kathryn, but that was the way things were going to be until at least 14:00, when Roser wanted us to be at Cinderella&#8217;s Castle for check-in with the chaperones.<br />
(Anyone wondering why I haven&#8217;t yet mentioned J, Ali or Hil? They didn&#8217;t go with us. We had three choices for spending the day. One was, obviously, Disney World (Magic Kingdom), the second was Epcot Center, and finally Universal Studios. Hil, Ali and J went to Universal. When I found out about the Star Trek adventure, I wished I had gone there instead. Oh well, maybe next time!)<br />
At first we weren&#8217;t sure where to go. Finally, we decided to head to World Of Tomorrow. Why? Don&#8217;t ask me, I ain&#8217;t got a clue. Anyway, fewer that ten feet into the subdivision of Disney World, we headed into the line for the first of our rides. This one was called Mission To Mars. It looked interesting, and not touched since it was built in the fifties or sixties.<br />
When you do finally enter the building, you have to wait in a lounge with three doors at one end, watching a clock count down to zero before you enter. This gave Ali, Emily and Chris time to chat. Sitting at the far end of a line of four people makes talking rather difficult. Finally, the doors swung open and we progressed into the hallway beyond.<br />
In there was a mock-up of Mission Control, kept behind a glass wall. At the far end was one of the employees, someone who sounded like he had practiced his lines too much. Inside the Mission Control area were eight or nine Animatronics robots, who acted out the tasks their human counterparts actually did.<br />
One of them was the narrator, who gave us a general idea of what we were in for. I&#8217;ll give it to Disney, they certainly know how to make a dummy look awful real. The motions were a bit mechanical, but I had seen worse. Once, the narrator stopped when an alarm went off, and all the screens changed to show an Albatross landing (I think it was an Albatross, whichever bird it is that can never land smoothly, and usually crashes), which set off all the alarms.<br />
Once that little skit was over, we were hustled into another room around the corner at the end of the hall. There were two of these rooms, we were hustled into the room on the left of the hallway. At first I thought it was going to be like the Tour Of The Universe at the CN Tower back in Toronto. Unfortunately, this one was the forerunner of the CN Tower&#8217;s by at least fifteen years.<br />
There were four screens in the room (which looked a bit like the bridge of the U.S.S. Enterprise), two circular ones at the top and bottom of the room, and two rectangular ones on the walls. One we could not see, we were sitting right under it. Through the bottom one, we could &#8220;see&#8221; ourselves leaving the ground. To accompany this, all the seats sank a bit (you could hear the hydraulic systems kicking in). It felt weird to have your ass sink into the seat like that.<br />
Once we were in orbit, we were given a quick low down of the flight, then sent through hyperspace (ooh!). I&#8217;m sorry, but Disney makes enough every year to upgrade that ride into a state of the art exhibit. The hyperspace effect is the cheesiest one I have ever seen. As an avid fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, that was too much to take without comment.<br />
When we arrived at Mars, probes were launched and we got glimpses of Mars from those cameras. I think Tour Of The Universe should try something like that, that was well done. Then we ran into danger (not unexpected), a meteor shower. So we hyperspaced back to Earth and landed back in Florida. Then the ride was over, and we left.<br />
Once we were back outside, we progressed our way towards Space Mountain. Chris and I wanted to go in right then, but Ali absolutely refused to go. Chris and I were determined to get her on it, but decided to wait until later that afternoon for the others, especially when we saw the lineup to get on. So we turned to our left and continued up the walkway, right into a gift shop.<br />
There was some neat stuff in there (an $80 embroidered jean jacket with Mickey Mouse and stuff on the back) and a rather large rack o&#8217; sunglasses. Chris spent about ten minutes going through them all before finally choosing a pair with purple frames and clear arms (mostly on the approval of Ali and Emily). Once we had purchased them, we headed back out into the outside world, where it promptly got cloudy.<br />
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t ya know it! As soon as I get sunglasses, it gets dark out!&#8221; cried Chris, rather annoyed at the lack of light.<br />
We headed right up to 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, and were about to get into line when I happened to notice a sign that read:<br />
Approximately 40 Minutes Wait From This Point<br />
So we avoided that one, even though I really wanted to go on it (it was closed the last time I was there), but we didn&#8217;t want to wait 40 minutes (it turned out to be one of the shorter lines we would wait in that day). I then argued the fact that the chances of us hitting a ride without lines were nil, and we agreed to go on the Mad Hatters Tea Party, which was right next to 20,000 Leagues.<br />
So we hopped in line and waited for about twenty minutes before our turn came up. All the while Chris and I were trying to convince Ali to come on Space Mountain. Then Ali (maybe it was Emily) asked us:<br />
&#8220;If you knew that you only had one day left to live, what would you do?&#8221;<br />
I hate those questions, I absolutely can&#8217;t stand them. Chris tried to answer it, but then protested that he hated the question too, that there was no real way to answer it. We kept whipping through the line, it went very quickly compared to the others that we would stand in. Then, our turn finally came.<br />
The four of us whipped onto the platform and jumped into one of the cups. We barely fit into it. In the centre was &#8220;the wheel&#8221;, that devilish contraption that allows one to make themselves so fast that they hurl in a beautiful arc onto other patrons of the ride.<br />
When the ride started, we tried to see how fast we could get that thing to turn, letting out heads dangle out when we hit the low parts. About five minutes later (and four chances to puke our guts out), the ride came to a halt and we disembarked, nearly tripping over our own feet we were so dizzy. It only took my body a couple moments to get its bearings, I don&#8217;t know about the other three.<br />
Chris and I really wanted to go to the Haunted House, but first we had to find it. So out came the trusty map that we were given. We followed the route over to the Merry-Go-Round from hell (the thing is huge!) and had to look at the map again, just to make sure. Then we headed for fun.<br />
The transition between one land to another within the Magic Kingdom is subtle in some cases, in others they do an awesome job of hiding it through tunnels or underpasses. But we were quickly in Frontier Land, and just up from us was the Haunted House, and a long lineup. We jumped in before it was too late.<br />
By then, the sun had come out again, and in full force. It was not only very bright out, but also quite warm. Before we went any further, I wanted to take a picture of Emily and Ali. However, they wouldn&#8217;t let me. So I took a photo of the back of their heads (I like strange and unusual shots). The line didn&#8217;t take too long to get under the awning that runs for a fairly long distance up to the front door.<br />
When we arrived at the front door, we were greeted by a rather strange woman who talked in a nice and creepy voice (I think Chris fell in love), telling us to get inside. I couldn&#8217;t help but get into the act by acting rather morbid. For example, when she told us to get inside one particular room before the door closed and crushed our bodies into a pulp, I responded:<br />
&#8220;COOL! That sounds like fun!&#8221;<br />
That particular room was really strange. At first, it looked like any normal room, six walls (the only strange thing, at first), a couple paintings and a ceiling. Then things got stranger. Another strange voice (this one male) came over speakers, reminding us that there were no doors (of course we all checked, and there weren&#8217;t). Then it asked us whether we were sinking, or the room was getting bigger. That was a neat effect. We could tell the room was rising, but you felt like you were sinking.<br />
Then the voice asked us how we were going to get out, as there were no doors. Then it suggested his way, at which point, all the lights went off, and we could see through the ceiling (a simple effect, the ceiling was made from fine mesh, painted to look like the ceiling). The ceiling above was much higher, with a single window, through which came flashes of lightning. Hanging from the very top was a dead body. Couple people screamed, several gasped, Chris and I went:<br />
&#8220;Wicked! This is gonna be cool!&#8221;<br />
At this point, part of the wall slid away, revealing a hallway full of people. Ali and Emily made sure that Chris and I stayed near the wall. Understandable, I was getting the jitters, wondering what lay ahead for us. I love that feeling, fear. It&#8217;s neat sometimes, others it&#8217;s a pain in the ass.<br />
I had thought that the house was a walk through type, but what we found was a continuous train of cars which sat two people each. Em and Ali went in the first one, Chris and I in the second. Then we began our trek into fear! (Yeah, right!)<br />
Chris and I had a blast in there, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out how they did some of the effects (most were fairly simple), and constantly babbling about how we wanted to move into the place. The train stopped a couple of times, probably due to people falling out of the cars at the other end.<br />
My biggest surprise was when we arrived at this one room, which was full of ghosts. At first, all you saw were thousands of ghosts flying up to the ceiling. The effect is fairly easy to do, but it looked sooooooooo cool! That was my favorite part. There were ghosts everywhere, it&#8217;s the place I want to be buried!<br />
When we finally got to the end, I wanted to go back. But first we wanted to see what else there was. So it was back into Frontier Land. We came up on the Hall Of Presidents, and we almost went in, until I informed them that you had to sit down in this, there was no ride as such. Chris informed me that &#8220;we have to move!&#8221; I had to agree with this, I hate just sitting myself.<br />
Down a little further, and we came upon the Sleepy Hollow Inn (I believe that was the name), and were about to get lunch, until we saw the prices and the limited choices. So we exited the establishment and aimed towards Main Street. Before we got too far, I nailed the others for a photo, with Cinderella&#8217;s Castle in the background. This time, Ali and Em didn&#8217;t turn away.<br />
We strolled down Main Street, checking out the available munchies, until we decided on a cafeteria that was right next door to World Of Tomorrow. The prices were high here too, but we were more interested in the selection. Chris indulged in an iced tea (which was real, not Nestea), and Ali, Em and myself all had an order of fries (each).<br />
We then snagged a table down by the balcony that over looked the &#8220;river&#8221; that ran from the castle, and tried to eat (and drink) without the wind blowing everything away. We weren&#8217;t always successful, but we didn&#8217;t lose any food. Almost. Emily was a little surprised when Chris ate the lemon that had come with his tea. This was the birth of &#8220;Lemon Woman&#8221;.<br />
Let me explain! A few minutes afterwards, Emily had Chris&#8217; lemon on the end of a toothpick, and was lightly flinging it from side to side. The three of us watched her carefully, to see what she would do. Unfortunately, Chris sat across from Em, and she was winging the lemon slice in his direction.<br />
&#8220;Go ahead, I know you want to do it!&#8221; said Chris, challenging Emily to toss the lemon slice.<br />
Whip! SPLAT!<br />
Yeah, she did it. Em nailed Chris square in the face with that lemon slice. All of us burst out laughing, and Emily became very apologetic. Chris countered her however, stating that he had told her to do it, and she did. Em kept saying that she was sorry several times through the day, and Chris kept trying to get her to not say it.<br />
After our lunch, Em and Ali made a quick pit stop in the washroom, Chris and I waited down by the table we had eaten at. We didn&#8217;t sit down, just stood at waited. I took a picture of Cinderella&#8217;s Castle (which from that distance looked really cool) and of a bush Dragon. If you&#8217;re wondering what a bush Dragon is, the Disney gardeners take bushes and turn them into sculptures.<br />
When Ali and Em returned, we head back towards Main Street. We stopped at the Ice Cream parlour though, so Chris, Emily and Ali could get something cool Ã¯ ¿ ½n&#8217; creamy. I abstained, the last thing I needed was a blast of sugar and be bouncing off the walls for the next hour or two.<br />
When they emerged a few minutes later, it was almost 14:00, the time we had to meet at the Castle. So we began the short jaunt up to the gates. We didn&#8217;t get too far though, before Emily&#8217;s ice cream cone began to melt. Chris doubled back for some napkins, returning a couple minutes later.<br />
When we first arrived at the walkway up to the castle, we couldn&#8217;t see anyone. I was about to check the other side when I noticed almost the entire group just off to one side of the walkway. So we joined them, taking pictures of the group while we were at it, waiting for Roser to show up. Chris and I whipped around the corner for a moment, to get a picture of ourselves. No, we aren&#8217;t secret lovers, it&#8217;s ritual. We did the same thing at Canada&#8217;s Wonderland, after we had successfully made our first ride on a roller coaster.<br />
Shortly after we returned to the group, Roser appeared at the top of the walkway that ran through the castle. He caught a hold of us, came down and took roll call. Then he reminded us of our return time, 18:30. We had to be back at the bus by 19:00, but it would take us about a half hour to get back with all the people.<br />
So again we divided back into our original groups (again, Kathryn went with Therese, Stuart, Linda and James) and went our separate ways. We headed back into Frontier Land (after taking directions from James to a store to find belts and wristbands &#8211; subsequently screwing the directions up a bit) to scout more fun. We continued along the main road in Frontier Land that bordered the river until we got to the end, which was in an elbow. At this corner, Disney was erecting a new ride, a Flume ride (can&#8217;t remember what they called it though).<br />
When we looked down the road from the corner, we saw our destination. Once we got there, we found the wristbands that Therese, Stuart, Linda, James and Kathryn and purchased earlier. Emily was the only one who bought one though. The store had some interesting things that I wouldn&#8217;t have minded owning, but it wasn&#8217;t the time, nor the place.<br />
We were on our way over to the other side, when Emily was called back by the salesperson. She forgot her change. To Chris and I, Ali mumbled a rather nasty blond joke. Ali is a strange girl. She loves to tell blond jokes, even though she&#8217;s blond too.<br />
Emily then got sidetracked at a small cart, where one could find small articles made from glass. Emily was caught there for at least five minutes before she finally bought a little glass alligator. That&#8217;s when we learnt about Emily&#8217;s passion for alligators. The three of us then crossed the courtyard to the shops in the other side to find Ali, who had disappeared into it. Those stores did rather well, both Ali and Emily forked over a lot of cash (about $20) in gifts and whatnot.<br />
Right next to us was Pirates Of The Caribbean, we immediately hit the line, we wanted to go on it. It was ironic for me, as eleven years earlier, I had run out of the line petrified to go on the ride. I know feel sorry for my father, as he really did want to go on that ride. Anyway, it was a good forty-five minutes before we got anywhere. After the allotted time had passed, we found ourselves at the loading dock, from which we would hop into boats for the trip. The loading area was made to look like a fort bordering on a river, or ocean. It looked real enough.<br />
We took our turn and loaded in, waiting for the controllers to let us go. The locks released and our boat was set free. For about a minute we drifted along, seeing nothing aside from cavern. Then, ahead in the distance, our first view of pirates. Then we rounded a corner and went down a very small hill, we didn&#8217;t even get splashed. BORING!<br />
What we ended up in was a huge room with a pirate ship on one side, and a Spanish fort on the other, both firing cannons (and missing most terribly). The effects were cool. We drifted along, under bridges, by more pirates plundering and lighting afire, basically creating pure havoc. The ride could have been slightly longer, but I liked it (considering I chickened out of it eleven years earlier, now I feel really stupid for doing that too!).<br />
After that, we had about fifteen minutes before we had to go to Space Mountain (where we had agreed to meet the others at the rendezvous point), so we checked out a few of the stores in the area. There were a few really cool articles of clothing in some of the stores (not to mention one very expensive leather jacket), handbags, jewelry, etc.<br />
We hopped down a store to one that sold things made exclusively from sea shells. Three guesses who the only one was who bought something. Yeah, it was Emily again. I can&#8217;t remember what she bought, but I think it was either a necklace or a bracelet. We hit one last store, which was dedicated to surf apparel and accessories. Chris purchased a new shirt there, a Bubble Gum Surf Board Wax brand t-shirt.<br />
By that time, we were late by about two minutes. So we hauled our asses over to Space Mountain where we found the rest. They had to have been there a while, they were quite some distance into the line. They let us in (no-one behind us made any verbal objection, fortunately) and we proceeded with the longest wait we would have that day. By the time we reached the main entrance, the sign said that we had at least forty-five minutes to wait before we would get to ride the scariest roller coaster I had ever been on. By this time, both Ali and Yvonne Harrop (who had been with Therese, Stuart, Kathryn, Linda and James) went over to one side to wait.<br />
This was a nasty wait for me in particular, I had to wait behind two couples who were deeply in love. This entire trip was a great benefit to those couples, and others on the trip, bringing both sides very close together. But for those of us who wished they were in one, it wasn&#8217;t so good. I tried to keep myself preoccupied, and not look in Stuart and Therese&#8217;s direction, else I would have wanted to leave (nothing against them personally, they had every right to do what they did).<br />
Unfortunately for me, this left me in a less than agreeable state. So I did my best to hide it. If there&#8217;s one thing I hate doing, it&#8217;s showing my moody states to my friends (though I have done too many times in the past). When we finally entered the loading area for the ride, I realized that in order to keep from feeling shitty, I was going to have to look up a lot.<br />
This gave me time to try and figure out the ride. That coaster was immense, though I couldn&#8217;t see most of it. The lights were virtually all off, and seeing anything in that light is next to impossible. The waiting area was well lit, it had to be or people would be tripping over everyone.<br />
Then Chris began his services as a tattooist, drawing pictures on Therese&#8217;s arm and Linda&#8217;s shoulder. I believe Stuart got one too, but I can&#8217;t remember if it was in Space Mountain or later, when we got back outside.<br />
Anyway, about a half hour after entering the loading zone (and having Emily point out that the meteors that were projected on the ceiling looked like chocolate chip cookies), we reached the cars. The train was made up of two three-seat cars linked together. Emily, Chris and I got in the first car; Kathryn, Linda and James in the second. Therese and Stuart had to wait for the next train. I was forced to sit at the very front.<br />
Then ride-from-hell began. The car was released down a long tunnel with flashing lights (that was cool, it was indescribably wild), then rounding a corner and latching onto the chain that would drag us to the top of the coaster, letting us loose. I could hear Chris from behind me, wondering why we had even got on the ride in the first place. I was hyped up beyond belief. That was a wrong move.<br />
The cars then took a downward plunge and for the next two to five minutes (it felt like an eternity), we hit slopes, curves, turns, hills and every conceivable thing that one can put on a roller coaster. I&#8217;m surprised that we didn&#8217;t hit any jumps. For some of the turns, there was enough light to see when the turn was coming. But for others, just darkness. I saw them coming, and I didn&#8217;t like it one bit.<br />
When I got off that hellish contraption, I was almost frozen in my seat. I was surprised that I hadn&#8217;t pissed in my pants. We got out and waited for Stuart and Therese to get in, then we hopped on the moving walkway to the outside world. Once we got out, we rejoined Yvonne and Ali off to one side. Then Chris resumed his tattooing, promptly drawing Wolverine slashes on James&#8217; arm. He drew on a couple people too, but I don&#8217;t remember who. A passerby watched with intrigue, for a moment I thought he was going to ask Chris to draw one on him!<br />
I did not get a tattoo, I didn&#8217;t want pen on my arm. Instead, I listened to The Rolling Stones on my walkman, until the others finally decided to leave (which happened to coincide with the return of Stuart and Therese from a very short shopping spree). With that, we headed for Main Street. Along our way out, just across the bridge that led from World Of Tomorrow to the Main Street area, we paused to view a rabbit as it bounced around, munching on the flowers. By this time I was too damn depressed to care.<br />
We hit the ice cream parlour again, the rest of the group who hadn&#8217;t been there earlier wanted to indulge themselves. Once again, I abstained. But this time, it was because I just didn&#8217;t feel like it. Instead, Chris and I went over to check out the Magic Store. Eleven years ago, they had some of the neatest things. But I didn&#8217;t find the trick light bulb that had intrigued me as a child.<br />
I let Chris know that I was going off on my own, I didn&#8217;t want to really hang around the group right then, and I wanted to check out the stores for myself without have to be waited on or wait for anyone else. So I hopped from boutique to crowded boutique. Hundreds of visitors all cramming for those little souvenirs. Memories and photos are all I need, material things just don&#8217;t seem to cut it anymore.<br />
By the time I had finished, it was rapidly approaching 18:00. I could have gone up after the rest of my group, but the chances of me finding them were slim. So I remained at the bottom of Main Street, near the entrance / exit, awaiting their arrival. By 18:20, I thought that they had gone through, somehow gotten by me. So I booted through to the other side, under the railway station, to see if they were by the monorail station. They weren&#8217;t.<br />
I waited on that side for a while, hoping that I could still catch them. Then it began to rain. At first it wasn&#8217;t too bad, but it did get a lot harder. Standing under a tree keeps one drier than if one were to stand out in the open, but I wasn&#8217;t about to go stand in the railway underpass, there were too many people crammed in there.<br />
At 18:30, I made a quick check of Main Street, from the lower end. Still nothing. Remembering our tour guide&#8217;s warning, I waited no longer than twenty minutes to 19:00 before heading for the monorail. I had to wait for two trains to come before I got my chance on, but the ride was short and quick. When the monorail arrived at the Transportation Center, I still had five minutes to get back to our bus, in slip 41.<br />
Sure enough, our bus driver was there, waiting for everyone&#8217;s arrival. I was the first to return, at exactly one minute to 19:00. I thought I had timed myself rather well, yet I felt uneasy about leaving the others behind. I hoped that they didn&#8217;t decide to wait for me, else they would miss the bus (though there was a slim chance of that).<br />
Eventually, my abandoned group came into view. None of them said anything to me when they came on the bus, I wasn&#8217;t surprised. I was expecting them to be furious with me, their reactions were not unjustly founded. When the entire group had finally returned from the Magic Kingdom, we left the parking lot and headed for Epcot Center, to retrieve the rest of our bus.<br />
The drive took about five to ten minutes, but we found them virtually waiting for us. Two minutes later, we were back on the road on our way out of Disney World. I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll get another chance to return.<br />
Somewhere around 20:00, we made a triumphant return to our hotel. The Universal people had not yet returned from their excursion, so we waited. Let me rephrase that. They waited. I did not care. I didn&#8217;t care about a lot of things right then. The Universal bus appeared about fifteen minutes after we returned, which meant that most people were heading out to dinner very shortly, all except me.<br />
Yes, for the second night in a row, I was forgoing with dinner. Why? I was not feeling sociable right then, I really wanted to be alone. Once the population of my room (and most of our section of the hotel) had dispersed for at least a half hour, I dragged one of the chairs into the walkway just out our door, put in my Sting Soul Cages tape (taken from my CD) and relaxed for the duration of the side (which was about fifty minutes).<br />
When the others returned about an hour later, we were left with about an hour to lights out. This gave us time to do what we pleased. The tape hadn&#8217;t quite finished the one side when I noticed Hil all by herself in the grassy area about ten metres from the hotel, between parking lots.<br />
So I went down to see what Hil was up to. She was trying to read The Bonfire Of The Vanities, for her English class. She could hardly get past the first page. We talked for a while, mainly on the subject about how miserable our lives were because we had no-one to share them with. This was one of the few times that I could agree with my partner in conversation, I actually knew what they felt like. Then Hil told me not to expect anything in the way of a relationship, as the unexpected always happens. I hate phrases like that!<br />
I returned to the comfort of our room after that, and took a shower (you could say that I was beginning to emanate an odour that was less than pleasurable). Then, after my hair had managed to dry to the point where I could get into bed without soaking my pillow, I settled down for a long spring&#8217;s nap.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40391.23</strong><br />
<em>Day 2</em><br />
This has been a rather hellish day! For starters, J&#8217;s f&#8217;in alarm clock went of at 6:30 for his jogging &#8211; he had to pick the loudest one too! James, Chris and I ventured to Friendly&#8217;s for some breakfast &#8211; damn good too!<br />
By 9:00, it was on the bus to DW. If our hotel had about fifteen floors, we could probably see the place we were so close. Despite a rather long wait, we finally got our day passes and were on our way. Chris, Emily, Ali Etherington and I took off from the rest to scout things out. At 2, we regrouped with the others momentarily, then we took off again.<br />
At 4, it was Space Mountain. This is the true definition of fear &#8211; I had to be at the front! By the time we got out, my brains were scrambled. It only got worse. Problems within me arose their ugly heads once more. I ended up taking off from the others. I think I pissed them off. That wouldn&#8217;t be too surprising. I must be the only person who could have gotten depressed at DW.<br />
Once again, I abstained from dinner (bad move), and sat on a chair outside our door listnin&#8217; to Sting. Hil and I seem to have landed in similar situations &#8211; both of us are sick of this trip &#8211; too much caring. But even though I want to slash my wrists, I admit it is necessary for couples that exist. Do I have a chance with anyone in particular? I&#8217;m not expecting anything &#8211; but I am going to give it a shot anyway.
</p></blockquote>
<p>After note: I wasn&#8217;t the only person to get depressed. So did Jessica Wallace. She can&#8217;t stand all the capitalism. Neither can I for that matter.</p>

		<p>A Dream&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.&#8221; came a husky voice over the p.a. I shut off my walkman to listen to the message. &#8220;We have encountered some technical difficulties, which will be remedied shortly. However, I am turning on the seatbelt lights and ask that all passengers remain seated. Thank you for your co-operation.&#8221;<br />
I didn&#8217;t like it, something wasn&#8217;t right. Being seated in the aisle had it&#8217;s advantages, like getting to the bathroom easily, but you couldn&#8217;t see out the window. I was seated in a group of people that I didn&#8217;t recognize at all, I was totally naked, yet did not feel in any way uncomfortable. Then I managed to get a glance out of the window.<br />
The wing was bending severely, to the point where it broke open, spilling it&#8217;s cargo of fuel into the hot streams of exhaust from the engines, igniting. The entire wing blew apart, ripping part of the wall out, sucking out passengers left and right. No-one panicked, aside from myself. But my seatbelt wouldn&#8217;t undo. Fire swept into the cabin and began to engulf seats, carpets and passengers alike. It came closer and closer, I could feel the intense heat; I could hear voices, calling my name.<br />
I sat upright in my bed, realizing that my mother was literally shouting at me. A dream, a rather nasty one at that. The clock beside my bed read 8:45 in the morning, and it looked nice outside. Deciding that I wasn&#8217;t about to get back to sleep, I proceeded to prepare myself for a very long day.<br />
That was Easter Monday and April Fool&#8217;s day too, April 1st, 1991. My mind was already working on ways of making my day a living hell. After relieving myself of a large pressure that was exerting itself from my bladder, I snagged a bit of breakfast, which I knew I was going to need.<br />
Then came the fun part. I had until that night to do the rest of my homework that was due during the week we would be in Florida. I sometimes felt that teachers should give us a break because we were on a school related trip, but I knew that the chances of them liking that excuse were limited to say the very least.<br />
I had finished my book review the day before, it sat on top of my luggage (also done the day before) so I wouldn&#8217;t forget about it. My task was to complete part of my Scican project, and make sure it was handed in on Tuesday, by which time I would be in Florida. That&#8217;s where my sister came in.<br />
I worked on it until about three o&#8217;clock, finishing three out of the four parts I had to complete. The only one I couldn&#8217;t do was a time line, the book I needed for reference was sitting in Therese Hollingsworth&#8217;s locker, I had neglected to get it before we left on Friday. I had thought that she might have it at home, but I was wrong, I found that out when I phoned her.<br />
At about three, Chris phoned (I might have phoned him, I don&#8217;t remember who phoned who). We discussed the plans for that night, he asked if it was possible for an automobile to get around, as he needed cash for his car insurance. I eventually worked my way into getting invited up, I could drive him over to James Hieminga&#8217;s house for the pseudo-party to be held that night.<br />
About a half hour later, I hopped in the family Caravan and booted on up to Chris&#8217; abode up in Sherwood Heights. Chris was literally on the verge on taking a shower, having finished packing five days of clothes into a large duffel bag, which was not light. So while he removed the layer of filth from his body, I fooled around on his computer.<br />
Amidst our activities, we were phoning Therese&#8217;s house to she if she had returned from shopping. Chris was borrowing cash from Therese so he could pay off his insurance, which was due while we were in Florida. Chris had recently lost his cash flow due to the recession.<br />
About a quarter to five, Therese arrived home, I caught her as she literally walked in the door. We arranged the afternoon between Chris and Therese as best as we could, getting money and all. Then I phoned the bank to find out when they closed. Five. Chris and I took off for the car, and booted down to Therese&#8217;s, calling her from the car phone (don&#8217;t ask about the phone &#8211; it&#8217;s a long story!). When we arrived at her house, she was ready to roll. We arrived at the bank at 16:58 (4:58 in the afternoon to you non-military types). Unfortunately, the bank had closed.<br />
We returned Therese to her home to pack her clothes (most of which were new, she didn&#8217;t like any of the clothes that she had) and get ready to leave. Chris got the permission to use Therese&#8217;s bank card, and we booted back to the bank, where Chris took out sixty dollars. He needed quite a bit more, but the machine would only let him take out sixty in one day. So I came into picture, and he snitched sixty bucks from me too!<br />
We headed from there to Major Video, where we were to rent a movie or two for that night. After about twenty minutes (which is a relatively short time for us to pick a movie), we had settled for Eddie Murphy &#8211; The Best Of Saturday Night Live.<br />
Then we drove back to Chris&#8217;. He had to have some dinner, his parents wouldn&#8217;t let him leave without it. We had to let James know that we were going to be a bit late. We still had to get some drinks and popcorn. At about 18:30, we headed out the door, Chris&#8217; luggage in hand. Next stop was my home, to get my luggage and my sister (she had to drive the car back home). As we exited Chris&#8217; subdivision, we had our first omen of a strange voyage, I nearly hit a Canadian Goose as it waddled across the street ahead of us. When we arrived at my home, I grabbed everything I could remember, and got all my homework assignments for my sister to hand in for me.<br />
Ever have that nagging feeling when you think you&#8217;ve forgotten something rather important? Chris and I both had it, and we had good reason. Now, we didn&#8217;t notice all this until much later that night, but Chris had forgotten a bank card (to deposit his money), I had not only forgotten my headphones (a total disaster), but also my alarm clock, which we were going to need.<br />
Anyway, my sister drove us out. Before we were barely out of our neighbourhood, the car phone rang. It was a mutual friend of my sister&#8217;s and mine, Alistair. He wanted to know what my sister was up to that night. He was told to phone back in about a half hour or so.<br />
We ended up at Tim Hortons where Chris snagged some Timbits for us to munch on that night. We were now an hour late, we knew people were going to chew our heads off. We didn&#8217;t care at all though, we were going to be at James&#8217; for a long time to come. We stopped at Barney&#8217;s Convenience for five minutes to get drinks, then we were off to James. No-one was pissed off at us, no-one else was there yet. So Chris and I got ticked off &#8217;cause we were the first ones there! We removed the stuff from the van, and my sister disappeared into the cool night air.<br />
So we began to have fun at James&#8217;. Tunes were the first priority. We listened to music for a while, inside a few games of table top pool (which is very hard to play compared to normal pool). Finally, at about eight or so, people began to show up. Stuart was the next to arrive on the scene. Not long after that, James brought out his watergun, which looked like a shotgun, and had a large range. Unfortunately, he did not bring it with him, it would probably have added a little excitement to our lives.<br />
Then Linda appeared from out of the inky blackness. She seemed a little preoccupied with something (she may have been tired, I can&#8217;t remember if I asked or not), but she still laughed when Stuart nailed James in the crotch with the watergun. James was not terribly pleased about that little incident. Mind you, no guy would be terribly pleased, it looked like James had pissed in his pants.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 40291.00</strong><br />
<em>Day 1</em><br />
And so begins the wait. Six hours from now, assuming nothing goes wrong (not that it already hasn&#8217;t, might I add &#8211; I&#8217;ve already forgotten my alarm clock and my earphones), we ought to be well on our way to the warm sun o&#8217; Florida. More entries to follow over the next twenty-two and a half (or so) hours.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Soon Therese, Kathryn and Hil arrived, all that were left to come were J and Ali. But first, an errand had to be run. Chris had to get to the bank at about midnight (I suspected that was when the bank machine would turn to the next day, so Chris could remove more money from Therese&#8217;s account), so I asked if it were possible to drop by my home to pick up the things I had left behind in my haste (I had also forgotten the popcorn, but we probably wouldn&#8217;t have eaten it anyway).<br />
At first James was reluctant to do such a trip, but gave in once he found out that Chris had to go home anyway to pick up his bank card. So the three of us piled into James&#8217; station wagon and sped off into the night. The car already had all our luggage in there, and room in the back was extremely limited, almost none for me.<br />
We soon arrived at Chris&#8217; house, he had to knock to be let in. His mother was expecting him, according to Chris anyway. He picked up his card from his other wallet, and bade his mother goodbye for the second time. Then it was back out of Sherwood Heights to my house. This was slightly more interesting for myself.<br />
After noticing that our new car had arrived (a small red Dodge Omni, basically for my sister and I to drive around), I checked the front door. Locked. I booted around the side of the house and hopped the fence. This must&#8217;ve looked rather odd to our neighbours, especially when James did the same to remind me to get a pair of sunglasses for Kathryn.<br />
I groped around in the partial light for the back door key (carefully hidden in clear view of anyone who might stumble into the backyard), and got into the house. My heartbeat jumped a lot, I was expecting to get caught. Carefully, I worked my way through the kitchen, into the hallway to my room, avoid as many creaky points as possible.<br />
Getting into my room, I closed the door before turning the lights on. I collected my misplaced articles, turned off the lights then quickly left the house, making sure I didn&#8217;t wake anyone up. Closing the rear door was a real problem. It has to be slammed to lock, and that would have waken up the entire neighbourhood. In view of this, I settled for nearly tearing the knob of for pulling so hard.<br />
I returned to the car, and we charged downtown. Along the way, we noticed Ali&#8217;s father returning home. That meant that Ali and J were now at James&#8217; house. We continued downtown anyway. We arrived at the first bank in a few minutes, and Chris withdrew the cash he needed. Then it was to the second bank where he deposited the $180 he had been collecting all day.<br />
About a half hour after leaving, we returned to James&#8217; house. Sure enough, Ali and J were there. But there was something important missing, that probably had caught everyone off guard. J had cut his hair. He had once had a lot of it too, more than most females. But now it was only shoulder length. Mind you, I think he looked better with it that short.<br />
Finally, after all the anticipation and anxiety, two o&#8217;clock in the morning rolled around, and we prepared to move out. James awoke his mother so she could drive the car (full of our luggage) over to the school. We picked up our jackets and shoes, and headed out. James and Chris broke into a rap of Ice, Ice Baby, I tried to partake, but I can&#8217;t do human boomboxing as well as they.<br />
When we arrived at OT, there weren&#8217;t many people there. Nor were there any buses. There was a cold wind blowing, and most of us were dressed in clothes that would be more suitable for warmer weather. In other words, we froze out asses off. Neil Murray, Jen Rumsey and Karl McNelly were already there, waiting in a minivan (having come from a pool hall and waited for about forty-five minutes or so).<br />
The empty parking lot of OTHS began to fill with students and parents alike, not to mention a pair of police cars. It seemed that Mrs. Stothart or Mrs. Crewe (I don&#8217;t know who got there first) had set off the school&#8217;s alarm. Fortunately, they came out and talked to them before we were all arrested and booked (like it would have happened &#8211; I&#8217;m just paranoid of cops).<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before everyone who was heading to Florida had arrived. Now we had to wait for the buses and a truck to arrive. The truck was already loaded with all the instruments and equipment, our cargo luggage was supposed to be loaded in there as well. Soon, the cheesewagons appeared from up Reynolds Street and pulled into the driveway. All our large luggage had been grouped in one place, all that was left was for the truck to show.<br />
It didn&#8217;t. After a while we found out that the truck was heading for the airport without us. So we ended up loading all the large stuff into the back of the bus (which took up a substantial amount of room &#8211; school buses aren&#8217;t that large y&#8217;know). That took about fifteen minutes. Then it was our turn to load in. Some of us had already taken seats, so it was just a matter of getting to them.<br />
Roll call was done, just to make certain that we weren&#8217;t leaving anyone behind, then the bus cabin lights when out, and we began our trek to Florida. As the bus turned onto the highway, I began to play AC/DC on my walkman, namely You Shook Me All Night Long, which I thought was kind of fitting, considering the situation.<br />
Roughly half an hour to forty-five minutes, we arrived at Terminal One at Pearson International Airport, Departure Level. At that point, we completely unloaded from both the buses, lugging luggage into the check-in area (not caring whose it was). The truck was already there (if I remember correctly) and it was also unloaded in a similar fashion. All forty-some-odd pieces were carefully dumped in the check-in area. By the time we were done, we had created a large mess of instruments, luggage and people.<br />
Somewhere around 3:30 or 3:45, we began to check-in our luggage and received our boarding passes. At first, the general idea was to just check our luggage, and we would receive our passes later, in alphabetical order. Because of security restrictions, we received our passes at the check-in. We were then told that we could wander off, so long as we returned at 4:45, so we could proceed through security as a group.<br />
James, Linda, Geoff (Barrett, not me), Stuart and Therese headed around the corner, with me in tow, to check out what was available. They found Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Four of them instantly jumped on it, Therese virtually in lead (she&#8217;s a TMNT addict). I decided to return to the area where the rest of out troupe was and crashed out there for a while. I didn&#8217;t sleep though, I was too hyper to doze off. This made Paul Taylor rather uneasy, he wanted to make sure I hadn&#8217;t eaten any sugar to that point. I replied that when I travel, sugar is one of the few things that doesn&#8217;t make my hyper (air travel does that by itself).<br />
Five o&#8217;clock in the morning arrived, and our group was beckoned by the guards to proceed through security. This partially annoyed the chaperones, they held some of us back to load instruments to the baggage carts that would take them to the plane. Surprisingly enough, it didn&#8217;t take too long. By the time we were finished, only about half of OT had managed to get through the security check. Those of us who had been loading jumped into the back of the line and awaited out turn.<br />
Once again, I managed to set off that infernal metal detector (no thanks to my belt buckle), but my carry-on luggage wasn&#8217;t even glanced at, aside from the X-Ray machine. From there, it was off to Gate K (virtually at the other end of the friggin&#8217; terminal). Just about the entire waiting lounge was full, there were only two or three vacant seats. I took a place on the floor next to Chris (who had gone through earlier), and shifted my position when I found out how wet the floor was (it had to have been cleaned no more than a half hour before we arrived).<br />
When 5:30 was reading on the clock, boarding began. It looked like a free-for-all, just about everyone on the flight got up, even though most of us wouldn&#8217;t be getting on for about another ten to twenty minutes. So we went over to the window and watched the baggage twits load the instruments onto the plane. Stothart cringed every time one of the small black boxes was tossed onto the conveyor belt. We were waiting for the double bass to be loaded. It stood about eight or nine feet tall, and was really bulky.<br />
Just as the baggage cart that contained the double bass lined up for unloading, the line began to move. I was to damn excited to wait for it, so I just headed forward. Ahead, I could hear problems arising as matching ticket numbers came up, something that wasn&#8217;t supposed to happen. It didn&#8217;t matter really, even though those people were with us, they got on anyway.<br />
I found that my seat was a row behind the door to the plane (incidentally, 757s have their doors part of the way down the fuselage, around row 12 or so), which looked interesting for getting off. I was seated a row ahead and across from Stuart and Therese, seated next to Andy Torr. Andy was on me in a second, barely getting time to sit down. I knew what the question was even before he asked it.<br />
His girlfriend, April Norcross (whose mother was one of the chaperones, something that Andy commented was going to be &#8220;interesting&#8221;) was seated with Stuart and Therese. I knew that he was going to ask to switch spots, I agreed almost as soon as the question was asked. April and I swapped places, I hoped I would get the window seat (that&#8217;s where April was). But Therese shifted over the seat to the window, I ended up with the aisle, Stuart between us. I didn&#8217;t bother to argue, just so long as we got south.<br />
At around six, the in-flight safety speech was delivered with non-existent enthusiasm by the flight crew. Much earlier (by about two months or so), several of the people in my little group had suggested that the entire OT group mimic the crew, following the patterns that some of us knew by heart. However, we did not, though I was tempted real bad.<br />
The plane shifted suddenly, then began to roll backwards for what seemed an eternity. Another vibration shifted through the fuselage, and the engines picked up their whine, the plane rolled forward. The p.a. crackled, and the co-pilot began his yak about the flight. All the while, the plane rolled and bounced its way to first flight of the day.<br />
Then the familiar roar that I knew so well erupted from our Rolls-Royce turbines, and we were thrust into our seats. Not to be boastful, but I&#8217;ve flown so much that I almost found this boring. I stress almost, I love flying so much I&#8217;m still excited by takeoffs. Next thing we knew, the bumps stopped and the plane leapt into the dull morning glow of Southern Ontario. She banked and aimed for Florida.<br />
Less than ten minutes later, the attendants began their rounds with orange juice and headphones for the in-flight movie, Home Alone. I had seen the movie before, but it wasn&#8217;t one that I really wanted to see first thing in the morning. Besides, we had already seen Heathers and Eddie Murphy &#8211; The Best Of Saturday Night Live earlier that morning.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
It is now just a little past 06:30, we are now being enthralled with the antics of Home Alone (oh joy), and awaiting for our diminutive breakfast. Presently seated in 13C, my immediate neighbours are Stuart and Therese, with Therese in the window seat. I can&#8217;t think of a better way to spend 2 hours and 9 minutes. This trip isn&#8217;t off to the start I had hoped for, oh so long ago. But at least I got my alarm clock and earphones (thanks to the efforts of James who was so nice as to drop by my home at almost 1 am).
</p></blockquote>
<p>Explanation needed! First of all, I was being sarcastic when I said: &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better way to spend 2 hours and 9 minutes&#8221;. This is because I was once deeply beguiled by Therese, but it was Stuart who swept her off her feet. This is a long story that I will not go into detail here. When I&#8217;m with one or the other, I was fine. When they were together, I got those nasty pains in my body that make me want to, well, cry. I can now look back on those times and laugh at myself, knowing what eventually happened.<br />
That&#8217;s why I was so glad to have retrieved my earphones. I knew that keeping myself occupied with music for the next two or so hours would be no problem. Fortunately, &#8217;twas no problem. And as for breakfast, it was actually filling enough to keep me going until we got to our hotel later that morning (which is for me, really good).<br />
It was about around 8:20 when our plane arrived in Orlando. I had since prepared myself for the temperatures I was expecting. I had worn a t-shirt, with a thin sweatshirt over top to keep me warm in Canada, and a pair of track pants. The track pants were now rolled up to my knees. When we disembarked, I was glad I had worn them, it was nice and warm (not hot, just warm).<br />
We trudged down the corridor, heading for baggage claim and immigration. Mr. Davidson almost instantly began to complain about something (his hearing wasn&#8217;t back to normal yet &#8211; there was something else, but I don&#8217;t recall if he mentioned what it was), and asked if anyone had a tissue. Mrs. Crewe was amazed at this, I was amazed that she was amazed (of course, I was used to this kind of reaction to flying as my mother had the same problem).<br />
The baggage took sometime to come through, the instruments kept plugging up the baggage conveyor. The larger instruments (like the double bass) were brought around by hand. After about a half hour, all the luggage had been collected and loaded onto luggage carts. Then we hauled the lot across the room (Karl and I shared a cart to save room) to the opposite side where all the instruments and baggage (aside from out carry-ons) were loaded onto another conveyor belt. Then we went through another security check (X-Ray machine and all) and hopped on a monorail car which took us over to the main building of Orlando airport.<br />
It was not the same airport I remembered from the last time I had been in Orlando. Of course, that may be due to the fact that the last time was about eleven years previous. Back then, you got off onto the tarmac, not into a three building, monorail connected terminal system with automated baggage control.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take us long to find the second baggage claim at the main building. But it did take a long time for our stuff to come through, almost forty-five minutes for all of it to appear. By this time, most of us had been awake for about twenty-four hours or more. Time had almost no concept to the majority of the group.<br />
After a while, Beber called for all residents of Bus One to move out to the sidewalk outside, as our bus was due to arrive soon (I use &#8220;resident&#8221; because we spent a lot of time on those buses). All the luggage and instruments were carted outside. The sidewalk platform was tiled, and utterly spotless.<br />
&#8220;Holy shit!&#8221; exclaimed Chris, &#8220;This is so clean you could eat off it!&#8221;<br />
There was another twenty minute or so wait there too, before our two buses arrived. Bus One came about ten minutes before Bus Two, which gave us some time to load all the stuff on it. That was when we first met Dick, our driver. Even though it wasn&#8217;t in his job description, he helped us load the bus. It took James, Chris, Sonny, Paul, Chris Stratten and I about fifteen minutes and a lot of careful planning to get all the stuff on.<br />
The reason for the length of time was that the decision was made to put all the instruments and equipment on one bus, ours. Somehow, we not only managed to get all that on, but all the our luggage as well. By the time we were done, the bus sat about four inches lower, and you couldn&#8217;t stuff an orange into the lower compartments.<br />
Then we headed out, to a parking space just away from the platform. We had to wait for Bus Two to come. While we waited, Dick told us, &#8220;Welcome to Orlando, my name is Dick and I&#8217;ll be your driver for the majority of your stay. I&#8217;ve lived here for eighteen years, and I&#8217;ll try to answer any questions you have about the area. And if I don&#8217;t know the answer, I&#8217;ll lie.&#8221;<br />
Then James tried to pop the rear hatch to let some air into the bus. That&#8217;s when we were told about the air conditioning ports. I don&#8217;t call myself the Observer for nothing. Most of the bus didn&#8217;t hear Dick the first time &#8217;round. I saw him show it to one of the upper rows, and followed suit.<br />
Dick promptly went down the aisle, showing everyone else. When he got to me, I told him that I figured it out, and I was cooling off with the machine driven breeze. Dick tipped his hat back on his head and&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Figured it out huh? Where&#8217;re ya from?&#8221; he asked, I thought for a moment I had pissed him off. But, having experience in annoying people, I had a hunch he was a bit like me. So I paused a moment before replying.<br />
&#8220;Canada. Southern Ontario.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I thought so!&#8221; he said, with a straight face. Then he laughed and walked to his seat. It was then I knew for certain that we had a cool driver, and hoped that we had him the entire time.<br />
Bus Two emerged from the Terminal about ten minutes after us, and we headed off to the hotel. Bus Two&#8217;s driver was a bit of a twit, or at least that was the impression that I got. He seemed to get lost a bit too often. Anyway, we hit the highway and headed off in what I thought was the direction of our hotel.<br />
We passed about half a dozen Days Inns (the hotel chain we were to be staying at), and about twenty other hotels. We went through two or three toll booths (a lovely little detail that I had totally forgotten about, something I&#8217;m glad Canada has not adopted) and an hour of traffic before we turned off the highway. Dick did some fancy maneuvering (which is not easy with a four ton bus) and avoided more traffic.<br />
Then we were on our way. Soon, we passed the Mercado Shopping Center, the location of one of our performances later on that week. Less than five minutes later, we realized that we had literally double-backed on ourselves, going through an underpass of the highway we had just come off of. Had we gotten off at that turn off, we would have saved about a good half hour or so. I assumed that Dick didn&#8217;t know exactly the best way to get us there, or he wanted to show us a couple things along the way.<br />
We passed by Sea World almost immediately after that, not to mention more tourist stores than I could count in the five days we were there. After a long while, we arrived at a large intersection, where I was bombarded with a wicked feeling of deja vu. Had we kept going straight, we would have landed in Disney World. It was the same intersection I had gone through eleven years previous.<br />
We turned to the left and continued along that road. Another left and a longer drive, and we arrived at our hotel. It took long enough, but we were glad to have arrived. But the wait wasn&#8217;t over yet. First we had to wait for our guide (who had met us at Toronto and was with us the entire time &#8211; never did find out what his name was) to get our rooms organized.<br />
What we did end up with were common rooms to put our stuff until the rest of the rooms were ready. Dick then booted us around back, where the rooms were. We unloaded into the common rooms and proceeded to the lobby of the hotel to get our separate room keys. James found out that our room was one of the common ones, and we had to find out who had the key. J had gotten it off of someone (never did find out who) and moved in. We followed suit very quickly. If you&#8217;re wondering what had happened to the instruments, they were all left on the bus. We were going to a performance that night, and it was easier to leave them where they were.<br />
The rooms were virtually all the same, aside from the positioning of the furniture and the door. In our room, the air conditioner sat to the immediate right of the door (and was usually on&#8230; high); a table just in front of the air conditioner; then James and Stuart&#8217;s bed; a night table and a gap between James and Stuart&#8217;s bed and Chris&#8217; and my bed where J&#8217;s mattress sat; then Chris&#8217; and my bed. Across from the beds on the other wall sat a two drawer bureau with a television and radio combination. At the back of the room was the mirror, sink, counter and clothes rack. Then, to the side of the room with the beds (to the right from the door) sat the bathroom, with shower / bathtub and toilet. Basic, but comfortable.<br />
We changed quickly into a fresh change of clothes (even my rolled up track pants were too warm now) and we headed out. We were starving, we needed some kind of nourishment. The guys were ready fast enough, the women took slightly longer, which is understandable. Let&#8217;s face it, men are slobs! I should know, I&#8217;m one of them.<br />
Then we were off to the mall diagonal to our hotel. We had already shifted into shopping mode, and we knew there were restaurants in there (I haven&#8217;t found a mall without a restaurant yet). Sure enough, we found food really quickly. I indulged in Chinese something, I only recognized the beef and green peppers, and the rice. Come to think of it, that was all I had anyway! But that&#8217;s beside the point&#8230;<br />
After filling that empty void within me, we headed off one at a time to check out the rest of the mall. There was a music store there, but I opted not to buy anything for a while, I wanted to shop around first. There was also an interesting video arcade (where I found Chris deeply involved in Aliens, I joined in), an Eckerd&#8217;s Drugstore, a Walmart and a few other dinky little shops.<br />
We eventually gave the mall up when Chris and I lost track of everyone. So we headed back to the room, hitting the 7-11 along the way. It was nice to have that place really close to us. There we snagged a twelve pack of Pepsi (or as Hil might put it, half of a two by four) and a pack of donuts. Yes, we were off to a nutritious start!<br />
Passing by the pool, I found Linda in the fenced in area, catching some rays. I thought it would be nice to get a swim in. So, after returning to the room, I changed into my bathing suit, and along with James, headed to the pool. Both James and I wore Speedo style bathing suits, though I must say that James had to look better in his than myself, his body is more defined than mine.<br />
We entered the pool zone and spread out for a moment. I went in for a quick dip, and I mean quick. That was the first time in almost two years that I had worn that bathing suit, and the water was cold. Men, every have a testicle caught in a pair a vice grips? Same feeling. I got totally wet, then got out. I got a little sun, not much, then headed back to the room.<br />
While I was at the pool, I found out that Florida had already taken a victim. Therese&#8217;s skin is fair, almost pure white. She had sunburn in less than twenty minutes. I can assure you, though I never asked her, that it wasn&#8217;t the way she wanted this trip to get off to start.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong><br />
A little over twelve hours ago, we were freezing our asses back up in Canada. Therese has already received acute sunburn. We have our room, we scouted out the local mall, raided the 7-11, went to the pool, swam a little, and silently gawked at the babes to in swimsuits (or sometimes the lack thereof).
</p></blockquote>
<p>At four o&#8217;clock that afternoon, the five of us (J, James, Stuart, Chris and myself) changed into our choir uniforms that we were to need for the performance that was to be held at a Seniors Resort somewhere in Orlando. By 16:15, we were at the buses, taking our seats. The instruments were still inside, so we didn&#8217;t have to waste our time loading it.<br />
We spent the next three quarters of an hour turning corners, speeding down straight-aways and getting nailed by red lights before we finally arrived at our destination. It looked peaceful enough, the primary vehicles were golf carts. After hunting around, we finally found the common hall, and pulled in. Then we unloaded the bus.<br />
Bus Two on the other hand, got lost. Their driver was forced into the wrong lane and made a bad turn. Bus Two showed up roughly ten minutes after us. Once they were off, we headed in to begin the single worst performance that any of us would ever do. Of course, you must remember that almost none of us had slept in over thirty hours by that time.<br />
The concert began somewhere around 17:30, maybe 18:00. As I said, time really had no meaning to us. Concert Choir was the first one to perform, and we were the worst. Most of the basses were off key, almost everyone was off tempo, basically we sucked something fierce. We also managed to totally bugger up the ending to When The Saints Go Marching In. Then it was Jazz Choir&#8217;s turn.<br />
Jazz Choir is made up mostly of the people in my group (Hil, Chris, James, Therese, Kathryn, J, Cindy Merson, Angie), and they are perfect. Never before, in all their performances, even their practices, had I heard something as small as a foul note. Even Jazz Choir was off that night. We were not in good shape.<br />
Jazz Ensemble and Jazz Combo were next, and I lost attention. I was simply too tired to care anymore. But even though I was in La-la Land, I could hear the small discrepancies that let everyone know that we were not ready to perform. Wind Ensemble, who had performed so well they were invited to Vancouver for the Canadian Championships, played not up to snuff.<br />
All I can say is that seniors have got to be the most polite people in the world, either that or most of them were stone deaf. They applauded after every number that the choirs and bands did, and even after all that terrible music, still gave us $98 for our troubles. Stothart desperately tried to refuse it, but she had to give in. In addition to politeness, seniors are stubborn as hell.<br />
Afterwards, many of the audience thanked us for &#8220;a concert well done&#8221;. Following proper courtesy, we smiled as strongly as our bodies would allow and thanked them gratuitously. Then we moved all the instruments out to the buses. Let me rephrase that. A few people (including Dick and the other driver, Warren) moved the instruments out. I retreated to the bus to fall asleep, which I didn&#8217;t.<br />
Soon, the buses were loaded with passengers and chaperones, and we returned to the hotel. Conversations echoed inside our bus, everyone knew that our performance had been well below acceptable. There is no worse critic of an artist than himself / herself. Stothart didn&#8217;t need to tell us that we had sounded horrible.<br />
When we arrived at the hotel, the same people who loaded it, unloaded it into Mr. Roser&#8217;s room, where all the electrical stuff and the large instruments were to be kept. I think I helped with a couple things, but I was on the verge of passing out, so I don&#8217;t remember. Getting back to the room, we changed into our street clothes and prepared to head out for dinner for 20:00 (less than twenty minutes after we returned), all except me.<br />
I was feeling like, to use a colourful metaphor, shit. I was not only exhausted, but emotionally drained. Too much of watching couples and wanting to be half of one. My mind loves pissing me off, and it does a good job of it too. Instead, I stayed behind. At first I thought I would go out on the walkway (all the room doors were outside, no inside hallways) and take in some night air. Only I was too tired to do so.<br />
James, Stuart and Chris tried to drag me out of the room for some food, but I didn&#8217;t want to go. I think they know of my stubbornness, for they gave up trying to convince me. About fifteen minutes after they left, Linda phoned. That scared the hell out of me, the ringer was on full, and I was dozing off. She hadn&#8217;t gone to dinner either, she was too tired as well. Couldn&#8217;t blame her.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Third Supplemental</strong><br />
This evening&#8217;s performance sucked shitwings! It couldn&#8217;t have possibly gone any more wrong. Concert Choir was the worst, but even Jazz Choir made a couple of mistakes (major rarity). To top it all off, I can&#8217;t get you-know-who out of my mind.</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite what Mrs. Stothart thinks, I didn&#8217;t join the choir just to sing. As I have told my friends repeatedly, the major reason for joining and suffering through untold practices was so I could get down to Florida and have some serious fun. Mind you, I did try to find another way, but peer pressure soon got too much and I gave in. It was fun (sometimes), and we had a few laughs. But I had ulterior motives.<br />
Before I continue, I should quickly describe the people I spent most of time with while I was in Florida. First of all, there was the group to which I was a grateful member, ours was a group with no name, it was &#8220;there&#8221;. In this group were the following people (in alphabetical order):<br />
Linda is an interesting person to try and describe. She stood about five foot five, blond hair, figure from hell. Besides that, she was plain weird. Oh, she also had this thing about James Dean, and motorcycles. I could say a few other things (believe me, I would too) except that they would not only be unfitting for this story, but may result in the loss of certain vital organs from my body.<br />
(Hilary) Hil was another strange person, mind you I think she had always been that way. Hil stood into the six foot range (barely), and had the figure of (sorry, but this is the only thing that comes close) a pencil, but with womanly curves in the proper places (hopefully this won&#8217;t get me killed!).<br />
James was the boyfriend of Linda, and was also blond (hmm, forming a master race?) and only a little weird. Having spent a couple years on the swim team and continuing on into lifeguarding (as did Linda), James had by far the best defined body of any of the &#8220;men&#8221; on the trip.<br />
Therese was the most diminutive person in our little group, about an inch or two shorter than Linda. Periodically someone might make fun of her about that, but not often. First of all its not nice; secondly, it really doesn&#8217;t matter how big a person you are. It&#8217;s the size inside that counts (GOD! Gag me with an atom bomb, that sounds corny!) If you could measure her inside, Therese would be pushing ten feet, at least!<br />
Chris was almost a spiritual brother with me. For starters, we shared the same birthday (July 16th, 1972); and the same ideas on some subjects (it always freaked me out when that happened). The only black person on the trip (I&#8217;m pretty sure of that), he stood out fairly easily (except in the dark, when he was a pain in the ass to find). Chris had a couple screws loose, his mind was really off the air. Incidentally, by the end of the trip, Chris and I were the only single men left in our group.<br />
(Alison) Ali was virtually the same size as Linda, and was an accomplished flautist (she&#8217;s damn good too!). And like the rest of the women who&#8217;ve been explained, she also was a little out of normal. Unlike the rest of the women though, Ali was much quieter, she usually kept to herself (unless she was with J, her boyfriend).<br />
Stuart was Therese&#8217;s boyfriend, and a good friend of mine. He was the only person who needed glasses that wore contacts whenever possible (J had contacts, but didn&#8217;t use them anymore). This guy was definitely loopy, and a good artist.<br />
(Jason) J was the quietest guy, usually. As I mentioned, he was also Ali&#8217;s boyfriend. J is hard to explain, I don&#8217;t even think God knows exactly what he was. Tell ya what, read on, you figure him out for yourself!<br />
Kathryn was the only single woman by the end of our trip (in our group), but I think there were underlying reasons for that. When Kathryn wore sunglasses, you&#8217;d swear you were looking at Meryl Streep as a teenager, it was kinda creepy when you first met her, but you do get used to it.<br />
Lastly (and leastly) was me, The Observer. Actually, I&#8217;m known as Geoff Sowrey, but I&#8217;d answer to several names. I&#8217;ll try to explain myself (I&#8217;m partially schizoid, so at least one of me knows what I&#8217;m like). There were two distinct Geoffs: one crazy, one solemn. The crazy one I dubbed the Loonatic (yes, LOON is correct &#8211; I&#8217;m into waterfowl). I liked this particular self because of the strangeness that he exhibited. The other self was usually in a state of semi-depression. I have no name for this self, &#8217;cause I didn&#8217;t like him that much. But all of me, to the core, was a Trekkie, and lovin&#8217; it!<br />
Then there were the people that I hung around with periodically during the trip. There was Karl <!--McNelly-->, Geoff B<!--arrett-->, Neil <!--Murray--> (I knew him even before coming to Oakville Trafalgar High School), Kara <!--Coghill--> (Geoff&#8217;s girlfriend), Ali <!--Etherington-->, Emily <!--Patrick-->, and well, almost half of the rest of the group in Florida. Being cooped up in one area can be suffocating after a while, it helps to spread out once in a while.<br />
Our trip was almost thrown into jeopardy at one point in the early days of 1991, when the Allied Coalition made their attack on Iraq. The school board panicked (big surprise there!), and debated whether or not to cancel out of country trips. Outside of North America trips were cut, but those within were not. Hussein or no Hussein, we were still goin&#8217; south!<br />
Practices continued right through to March Break on a normal schedule. Then they began to get screwy. We didn&#8217;t have any practices during the break, resuming when we returned. The first week the practices for choir were normal, Tuesday and Friday mornings at 8:00. The week before we left saw Tuesday and Thursday, Friday was Good Friday (in more ways than one). We would not be returning to OTHS until ten days later.<br />
The general idea behind this trip was the Heritage Music Festival, at least that&#8217;s what were told it was called. It&#8217;s actual name was the Orange Blossom Festival (I liked the first one better). If it weren&#8217;t for that festival, under either name, we would not have gone.<br />
But, what&#8217;s done is done, I don&#8217;t think the management of the Days Inn that we stayed at will forget us any time soon (there were enough complaints about the noise), nor will Dick, the totally righteous bus driver. On with the story&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890714.17</strong><br />
<em>Day 15</em><br />
We are presently at our cruising altitude of 31,000 ft heading for New York. A few minutes ago, we passed over Iceland. Earlier this morning, Kelly B., Pete and myself scouted out the market by the harbour. It felt so good to smell fresh fruit after two weeks of fish. I got to freak out a couple of people who were at breakfast today. They leave (probably left by now) for Moscow today. Both of them HATE fish.<br />
During our tour today, we saw the neatest church. Built in the sixties, it is embedded in a rocky hill. Only the doors and dome are visible. We also went to a park dedicated to a famous Finnish composer, but I can&#8217;t spell let alone remember his name! We are approx. 4 hours. out of New York. Almost Home.
</p></blockquote>
<p>No-one in our room moved quickly that morning. My alarm went off, instantly waking everyone in the room. Although we were awake, we were slow to move. My brain was the first to kick in and as a result, was the first in the shower. That was a slow morning. After I got out, feeling a hell of a lot better than I went in, I changed into the clothes that were to last me for the next 24 hours and stuffed everything else into my suitcase.<br />
Leaving our baggage in our room, we progressed downstairs for breakfast. What a surprise! Pancakes, cereal and milk, eggs, just about anything we hadn&#8217;t had in the past two weeks. But in all that wonderful food, the only thing I could eat was the same thing we had been eating for the past two weeks. Talk about pathetic irony.<br />
As I ate with Jason, we were joined by a pair of girls who were heading to the Soviet Union that day. When she asked us what to expect, we let her in on most of the ugly details. God it was fun! My favorite part was when we told one of them that fish was served every night at dinner. She hated fish. After two weeks, so did I.<br />
Following breakfast, we ended up with about two hours of free time to get in a shopping or whatever before we had to leave to catch our flight to New York. Pete, Kelly, Jason and I decided to see what we could find. We got about a block before we ran into Mr. and Mrs. Hosking who were returning after an early morning romp through Helsinki. That&#8217;s when we found out about the open market at the harbour.<br />
Our mission: find the market. We didn&#8217;t realize how close we were to the harbour to begin with. It just took us a while to find it. After going down enough roads, we managed to run into Kim and Lisa P, who were shopping (of all things). That&#8217;s when we lost Jason to Kim.<br />
So the remaining three of us continued in the quest for the bazaar. We ended up in the old town square, thinking that&#8217;s where the market was. It wasn&#8217;t. And we had no idea where to go. Kelly however, with her eagle eyes, spotted something through an alley. So we followed her lead down the narrowest sidewalk I had ever been on to end up across the street from the market.<br />
Even from there, our lungs were filled with the smell of fresh fruit. It was heaven. After two weeks of smog and canned peas that had the consistency of monkey balls, the smell of fresh strawberries was unbelievable good, even though I can only eat them frozen in ice cream. The market itself isn&#8217;t permanent and probably changes its configuration from day to day. But I&#8217;ll guarantee that they do a lot of business no matter where they are. Fruit stands, vegetable stands and souvenir stands were all over the place. We had a ball. Pete and Kelly indulged themselves on a large basket of strawberries while I spent sometime looking around to see what I could find.<br />
Lo and behold, I found a stand that sold t-shirts, my favorite kind of souvenir. I quickly found a shirt that said &#8220;Suomi Finland&#8221;. Suomi means Finland in Finnish. I had to get it. But I found another shirt that I wanted. It said &#8220;I survived CCCP&#8221;. I got &#8217;em both, and they weren&#8217;t cheap. I thought I was going to have a bit of trouble communicating with the person attending. But much to my surprise, she spoke perfect English, with no accent yet! Couldn&#8217;t resist a chat with her.<br />
After my purchase, the three of us continued to look around. I was kind of amazed at all the fur hats, fur coats, fur anything and everything. Animal rights activists would have had a field day! But we were more interested in other things. We found another booth that sold t-shirts, attended by a guy who looked awful familiar. Then I placed him. Remember that episode of Gilligan&#8217;s Island where a Russian dresses up like a ghost and tries to scare the castaways off the island? He looked like the Russian. Uncanny resemblance. We talked with him too. Pete bought a t-shirt I rather liked. It had a Nazi swastika in one circle, a Sickle and hammer in another. Both had large slashes through them. Humourous, I must admit.<br />
After that, we had no choice but to return to our hotel, so we could head for the airport. Upon our arrival, we temporarily split up (Kelly to her room, Pete and I to ours) to retrieve our luggage. But Shaun or Jason had the key, and neither of them had returned yet so we couldn&#8217;t get in. I had to get a spare from the front desk. We then hauled our luggage down and I dropped the key back off as both Jason and Shaun had returned. Our bags were loaded on the bus and we took our spots on the bus waiting for the others.<br />
Finally, we were ready to roll, tour guide and all. Our flight didn&#8217;t leave until about two o&#8217;clock so we had some time to kill. We didn&#8217;t leave right away though, we had to wait for a couple of people to return their keys. There were a handful of people who tried to keep their room keys from every hotel we stayed at. The ones in the Soviet Union were fairly easy to keep, but this one wanted them all back, or we wouldn&#8217;t get our passports.<br />
Finally, Greg returned his key and we were on our way. Helsinki is a nice place to visit and search by yourself, unlike Soviet cities. By bus tour, it&#8217;s not so nice. We came to the same square that Kelly, Pete and I had found earlier. We stopped for a quick photo session. Then we loaded back up to continue the trip. We passed by the market and through the downtown core of Helsinki. Along our route, our guide filled us in on some problems in Helsinki, namely the price of homes. If you want to move there, try and find a small apartment, that&#8217;s about as much as you&#8217;ll be able to afford, unless you&#8217;re rich.<br />
We passed several embassies, America, Turkish, and the new British embassy, still under construction. That road soon brought us to the shoreline, where we found people cleaning their rugs in the sea water, which we were told was a kind of ritual. A short trip from there brought us to the Helsinki shipyards. We didn&#8217;t get off, we just went by it. But we miss anything, we got a good look at the biggest cruise liner I have ever seen. Undoubtedly they&#8217;ll get bigger in the coming years. At that point we reentered the city. We never really left, we just got away from most of the buildings. We were then briefed on a church.<br />
&#8220;Another church?&#8221; I thought to myself in dismay. This was no ordinary church though, from the outside, it looked like a large pile of rocks. Of course, that&#8217;s what it was supposed to look like, or so we were told. We stopped at near the entrance, part of our tour was to take us inside. From the outside, looking through the doors, it still didn&#8217;t look like a church. It looked more like some fad sixties house than a religious structure. Inside, we were told to be quieter than church mice. That was hard in that place, there were no mice in there to model ourselves after.<br />
Besides, the place was so awesome, we couldn&#8217;t help talking about it. The inside was circular, with one door. The main room was about fifty to sixty metres in diametre and about twenty metres high. The roof alone was interesting, made from eighteen miles of copper wire. Between the outer edge of the roof and the top of the wall was a ring of clear windows.<br />
Across the room from the doors and a little to the left (I think) sat the organ, its pipes creeping up the wall. Immediately across from the door sat the traditional cross. Except for those two items, it sure didn&#8217;t look like church to me. That&#8217;s probably why I liked it so much.<br />
The church is small, not much larger than the majority of the ones we visited in the Soviet Union. As a result, the structure quickly lost its intrigue, and most of us exited to find something a bit more interesting. What we found was a store across the road. A few of us picked up something to drink while the rest of us view the souvenirs. I already had two t-shirts, and didn&#8217;t need anything else.<br />
Our tour progressed back to the waterfront, along the shore to a memorial park not far from the city&#8217;s centre. From the edge, you have no idea who it&#8217;s a memorial to, there are no signs. It&#8217;s when you find the sculptures in the middle that you know. To the man who created Finlandia, Sibelius.<br />
To be honest with you, I had never heard of him before. If I had, I don&#8217;t remember it. The park was small, many trees, a small pond with a fountain in the centre, a sculpture made of long vertical tubes and a relief of Sibelius&#8217; head. We didn&#8217;t stay there long, there really wasn&#8217;t much else to see. We hopped back on the bus and headed back into the city again, hoping that we&#8217;d find something a little interesting.<br />
We soon arrived at the site of the 1952 Summer Olympics. We didn&#8217;t get off the bus though, we were getting a bit pressed for time. We took a few quick pictures as we zipped by. We did stop a bit after it, where our tour guide got off. Our next and final destination was the airport.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take us long, we only got about three quarters of the way through American Pie (the extended version) before we arrived at the airport. At that point, the bus was emptied of its occupants and cargo beneath. We headed inside and walked rather briskly to the check-in counters for the long task of departure. It took about ten to twenty minutes to check everyone in. I was one of the last in line. By the time my turn came around, the only other person left was Jason.<br />
&#8220;Would to two of you liked to be seated together?&#8221; was the clerks question.<br />
Now I probably didn&#8217;t get across the strain that Jason and I shared during the last few days of the trip. But we both knew that relations were strained and we knew how long the flight was. We both knew the answer.<br />
&#8220;After two weeks of living with each other, we&#8217;ll be at each other&#8217;s throats in under two hours.&#8221; we replied in unison.<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ll take that as a &#8216;no&#8217;.&#8221; said the clerk.<br />
&#8220;Smart man.&#8221; said Jason. So we ended up at opposite ends of the plane.<br />
Following the usual routine, we ended up in the X-ray zone. As my largest bag had already been sent on to the plane from check-in, all I had was my camera bag and my carryon. The carryon bag went in but I tried to pass my camera bag around. All I got was &#8230;<br />
&#8220;If the film speed is a thousand or over, we&#8217;ll look at it. Otherwise just pass it through please.&#8221; said one of the guards in a monotone voice. Boy these guys looked like they liked their jobs!<br />
When I reached the other side, which for some odd reason looked a little familiar (gee, I wonder why), I happened to find everyone else. We were all grouped around the gate to our airplane (it was the first time since Toronto that we didn&#8217;t get on from the tarmac since Toronto). We had about 45 minutes before our plane boarded. This gave us some time to check out the stores again. I say again because we had checked them all out two weeks before. We did managed to pick up something to eat and drink. That was a good idea as we wouldn&#8217;t get anything to eat until later on during the flight.<br />
While I was looking around, I managed to see a sign of departure flights. A flight was leaving as I watched &#8230; to Toronto. We could have made that flight easily if we hadn&#8217;t taken that tour in the morning. Instead, we had to go through JFK and La Guardia before we got home. A small side trip that would soon prove to be rather interesting.<br />
At about a quarter to two, we boarded for our flight. I was four rows from the rear of our DC10. I had never been in a DC10 before and I&#8217;ll tell you one thing, I wish we were in a DC8. There was no leg room at all. It was a nine hour flight to top it off.<br />
Four days after we got home, my dislike of DC10&#8217;s grew to a pure fear of them, when a DC10 almost identical to ours (aside from the airline) crashed in Sioux City, Iowa. That completely freaked me out. I know that it was a chance occurrence, but it still gave the willies.<br />
Anyway, at about five minutes after two, we departed from the terminal and taxied to our position on the runway. It was one of the few times we left on time. In the Soviet Union, we really didn&#8217;t have a departure time, so we never knew if we were early or late. I had a window seat once again. My neighbour was a Finnish businessman heading for New York on, what else, business. We talked only a few times during the entire flight. I have to remember for the future to get an aisle seat on long flights. My earlier decision not to sit with Jason was proved to be of poor judgment.<br />
About an hour and a half into the flight, our lunch (or dinner as that case might have been, I had no idea what time it was) was served. Being airplane food (which I like a lot), it did not last long in front of me. Unfortunately, the flight was full and that was all I got. Roughly an hour later, we got our in-flight film, Cousins. BORING! I couldn&#8217;t watch it at all. I mean come on! In June they had Rain Man and at that time, half way around the world, they had one of my favorite films, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? No wonder the flight went so slow.<br />
Along our route, we passed over Quebec. I kept thinking &#8220;Hey, just give me a parachute. I&#8217;ve had enough of this flight!&#8221; But we kept on towards the U.S. of A. After an eternity on the air, we set down at John F. Kennedy International airport just outside of New York. Then the irony and the fun began. Irony? For starters, it was pissing rain. I was not having a good day. The last thing I wanted to see was rain. And to make it worse, we didn&#8217;t even come near the terminal to get off. We parked out on the tarmac again! So we waited for special lift buses to come and take us over to the terminal. Those of us in the back had to wait a hell of a long time to finally get out. So far, not so good.<br />
When we got off in the terminal, we were directed down the hall. Dummy me, I should have known &#8230; Immigration and Customs. Our connecting flight was at La Guardia and for the life of me, I&#8217;ll never understand why they don&#8217;t just have a shuttle bus!<br />
There were about a thousand people in that room. Most of them were from a country other than Canada. In case you&#8217;re wondering, Canadians get easy access to America, but not as easily as Americans. Jamie, being an American, just walked right through to a very short American entrance.<br />
The line moved agonizingly slow. Mr. Phillips, Jeremy and Andrew were the first of our group to hit the line. The Three Musketeers, Konrad, Chris, Marcus and myself were not far behind. We knew that we had a while to wait. Almost an hour and a half later, we were about to get to the immigration booths. There was a guard at the front, guiding us to awaiting booths. That must be the worst place to work if you hate people.<br />
Once we got through, we all headed over to the baggage retrieval area. Those of us who had accumulated then tried to get the bags of others in our group and group them all together. Slowly, one by one, more of our group came through. This was not good, they were coming in too slow. The clock was ticking fast. We had precious little time before our flight and we all wanted to make it. Because of this, Mr. Phillips took off to try and find our bus. But before leaving, he gave us strict instructions not to go through customs.<br />
About fifteen minutes later, some of us began to go through. We couldn&#8217;t be bothered to wait any longer. However, a few of us didn&#8217;t quite get the idea that we had to pass by clerks. Those of us who did had to turn them back, otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t get out of that room. We didn&#8217;t stay long on the other side. Security then had us move outside. It was probably for the better, it was getting rather warm in there.<br />
We found our spot outside at the corner of an overhang in the fresh air (fresh New York air? Another oxymoron). Fortunately for us there was a roof over our heads. As most of us were getting comfortable, we saw a distant flash followed five seconds later by a clap of thunder.<br />
Remembering the Kiev Night train, I instinctively turned around and glanced at Toni. I was right. Her dismal mood (similar to everyone else&#8217;s) had suddenly brightened up and her frown was replaced with a huge smile.<br />
&#8220;AWRIGHT!&#8221; she cheered at the sound of thunder. Her mood perked a few of us up too.<br />
Then the rain hit. And it did not come lightly. A better analogy than rain might be Niagara Falls. This was maybe the first time everyone dug out their rain jackets so they wouldn&#8217;t get soaked. Even under the overhang we were getting wet.<br />
A long wait later, KB finally showed with the bad news. Our bus had come for us, but because we didn&#8217;t show up (we were still in Immigration), it took off without us. KB had to phone Stockholm, Sweden (the HQ of EF) to get the name of our bus company. A second call went out to find our bus. He was assured one would arrive in time.<br />
We picked all our stuff up and headed over to the area KB said the bus would come and pick us up. No problem right? Almost. We had less than half an hour to get to La Guardia, check-in and get to our plane. Everyone was ready when the bus did arrive. The bags were loaded at light speed and we were outta there in under five minutes. But we still had one very large problem &#8230; we were trying to get to one of the busiest airports on the Eastern coast, on a Friday, during rush hour. Time was not on our side.<br />
We found out the name of our driver through the efforts of Lisa P. When she screamed it to the rest of the bus, all of us started cheering at him. A couple of us shouted &#8230;<br />
&#8220;STEP ON IT GEORGE!!&#8221;<br />
We popped Mr. Phillips&#8217; tape back in and finished off the last quarter of American Pie. We listed to only two or three songs during the time we were going to La Guardia. Hotel California and the above are the ones I remember.<br />
It was looking like a lost cause. Most of us doubted that we were going to make that flight. Konrad (my neighbour at the time) believed that we would make it. He tried to get everyone else going via The Wave, but didn&#8217;t get much response. Just as it was beginning to look utterly hopeless, someone spotted a low flying DC9. La Guardia! Everyone&#8217;s hopes suddenly lifted two fold. But we had only about ten minutes to catch that plane. George spotted a break in the traffic and floored it, getting us into the airport&#8217;s driveway.<br />
We got in at the Eastern end (and saw the pilots on strike) and began to pass every major (and no so major) air carrier along the way. Knowing our luck, Air Canada was at the other end.<br />
Four minutes. We unloaded the bus almost as fast as we had loaded it. Those of us who were on the ball then whipped inside to the check-in counter. KB, of course was already there. I put my bag up to be tagged, so did Konrad.<br />
Then the two of us looked at KB and asked &#8220;What now?&#8221; He replied to go down the hall and make the flight. So Konrad, Mr. McClelland, Paul, John and I whipped around the corner and charged down the hall as fast as we could go. Ben Johnson had nothing on us.<br />
Three minutes. I could have sworn I heard the William Tell Overture as we whipped through the crowd of people heading for their respective flights. Then all of the sudden, the crowd got very dense. We had forgotten about the metal detectors and X-ray machine. I had to grab Konrad by his suspenders before he shot right through them. This was not going well at all.<br />
Two minutes. We were fidgeting in line, it was obvious even to us. We were so close, yet so far. When our turn came, I didn&#8217;t give a damn about my film, I just tossed it in there. I set off the metal detector with all my coins, but the guard let me go.<br />
One minute. The five of us continued to travel down the hall like stampeding bulls. We almost charged right by our gate. But we managed to stop on a dime (and got nine cents change). We went to one desk and were sent to another. But we made it. Before we boarded though, we told the clerks there that there were forty other people yet to come.<br />
Everyone else made it onto the plane, but were scattered. Most of us were in the rear of the plane, the rest were somewhere up front. Greg and KB ended up in first class (the scum!). Due to our tardiness arriving, the plane was delayed at the terminal about an hour. Our luggage was going to arrive in Toronto at the same time we did. I swore never to gripe about a delayed flight again.<br />
When we did finally leave the terminal, we thought it would be a simple wait of three or four planes and we would be off. Yeah, right! This was New York&#8217;s La Guardia, on a Friday, during rush hour. English translation: we had to wait for thirty other planes to go first.<br />
Okay, I had to gripe about that. Everyone in the plane did. Ten I could believe, but not three times that number. Now that&#8217;s just plane outrageous. Over two hours after we were to take off, we were getting ready to follow suit. From my position in the middle of three seats, looking out the left and side windows, I could see New York, over what I assumed to be the East River.<br />
I wanted to see New York, I intend to visit there one day. That day will be December 31st, 1999. Hey, I wanna be around for the biggest bash the human race will ever see. And I won&#8217;t be going alone!<br />
Suddenly, the engines roared. The G-forces crept up on us, pushing us back in our seats. Next thing we knew, we were in the wild blue yonder, only a metal casing between us, a few thousand feet and the ground. The flight was a short one, a little over an hour or so. There wasn&#8217;t much to see or do. A lot of us fell asleep, it was late in the evening back in Helsinki, the time we were still working on.<br />
During the flight, I kept playing a tune over and over in my head. I didn&#8217;t have the tape (I had neglected to bring it) but after listening to it enough to wear it out, I had it memorized. It was one of Phil Collins&#8217; classics, a rather fitting one for us all. Take me home.<br />
The plane began to descend, soon we saw Hamilton harbour. We were close, very close. The plane continued to get lower. I dug for another tape in my bag. The wing extended and the landing gear dropped. It would not be long now. Timing landings was something I was always good at. The theme to Mission: Impossible finished just seconds before we touched down. When we did, everyone in the back let out a very loud cheer. We were home.<br />
And for the first time since we left, we pulled into the terminal to get off. No more buses. We were in no rush to get off the plane. We were all half comatose. But before we could go completely brain dead, we had to get through customs. Two booths and about a hundred people. As we were at the back of the plane, we were also in the back of the line. The crew of the airline had no trouble, they whipped right through their own personal line. One of them commented about my hat. I was wearing the one I had traded for with Igor, it was coated with all my pins.<br />
The guard at the crew&#8217;s booth opened it to the rest of us, and I jumped to be the first in line.<br />
&#8220;Where are you coming from?&#8221; he asked me.<br />
&#8220;Soviet Union.&#8221; I replied wearily.<br />
&#8220;Welcome back.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Thanks, I needed that!&#8221;<br />
One by one, we got through and headed down the escalator to the baggage claim area. Our luggage was just beginning to come through. KB had already got his and was working his way out. We had to check in with him before we left. A couple seconds later, my only piece of luggage appeared. I hefted it off the conveyor belt and without a second thought, headed outside.<br />
I found KB talking to my dad (somehow, I wasn&#8217;t surprised at all). I then told KB I was cutting out before I fell flat on my face. I was utterly drained.<br />
&#8220;So Tigger [that&#8217;s what my dad calls me], how are ya?&#8221; asked my father.<br />
&#8220;Dad,&#8221; I said in a very weary voice, &#8220;all I want is three things: my own bed, a long sleep, and a large pizza with double cheese and pepperoni!&#8221;<br />
With that my mom, my dad and I vacated the premises for home. I only wish that I had stuck around to say goodbye to everyone. I knew that we were to get together again in September to finish the last of our classes, but I still felt like I had to say &#8220;catch ya later dudes!&#8221;<br />
I can imagine (something I do rather well) what happened. I can guess that a fair number of people cried and undoubtedly, phone numbers were passed around. By that time, I was on the highway home. Upon my arrival, I grabbed something to eat (we hadn&#8217;t eaten a thing since the Helsinki flight, aside from a pack of peanuts at La Guardia), brushed my teeth, scribbled down a final journal entry and went to bed.<br />
I should have fallen asleep. But I still couldn&#8217;t help but think about one thing. It had been nagging be ever since I had got up that morning. Was that night really the end? Or was it simply the beginning of something much larger? Only time will tell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
We barely made our connecting flight to Toronto. You should have seen us sprinting through La Guardia in order to make our flight. Because of us, the flight was delayed about an hour and we had to taxi behind about 30 other planes. Upon arrival in Toronto, we all cheered. We then went through customs, said our good-byes, and disappeared into the night.</p></blockquote>

		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890713.11</strong><br />
<em>Day 14</em><br />
We have just visited St. Issac&#8217;s Cathedral near the Neva. It is a very large cathedral, compared to others that we have seen. Established in the early to mid 1800&#8217;s, it is a younger cathedral but due to Nazi attack, it is one that has needed much restoration. The inside is very impressive. There is a ton of room and precious metals and stones line the walls and pillars. The outside still needs some work but it still looks fine. One of the most impressive things is that the entire building is set on hundreds of logs. Another is the pillars out front. They are about 100 ft. high and about 10 ft. wide and all one piece.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t give Pete or Shaun a wake up call that morning. I didn&#8217;t think they needed one. They didn&#8217;t, they were downstairs before me with their luggage. We checked out before breakfast, we would not be returning there for lunch. From there came breakfast at the restaurant &#8217;round the corner. It seemed I wasn&#8217;t the only one who had been bugged. The only difference was that Lisa V&#8217;s, Lisa P&#8217;s and Greg&#8217;s bugs were all cockroaches.<br />
I never saw any cockroaches in my room during my stay. I saw a couple of mosquitoes (both of which I squashed) and an ant or two. But no cockroaches. It was because of the cockroaches that we saw a major change in Lisa V. At the beginning of that trip, Lisa was akin to a nun (not quite, but damn close). Back then, she probably would have shied away from doing any harm. During our last night however, she nailed fifteen of the critters with her bare hands.<br />
After our final breakfast, we returned to the hotel to remove our bags from the lobby. As the whole group was present again, we needed two buses. We got a new one again. Most of us in the Circle headed right for it. We thought that might as well live it up while we still could.<br />
Even though we were leaving Leningrad that day, we still had some touring left to do. Our only historical site that day was St. Issac&#8217;s Cathedral, about a block or two from the Neva. As the bus was new, we knew we could rely on the tape deck. In went a cassette of the Doors. That was perhaps the first time I was formally introduced to that group. That trip in general was an introduction to groups I had never listened to before.<br />
From the outside, the cathedral didn&#8217;t look too good. In fact, it looked as if it had just been razed by fire. The surface was black and scaffolding was erected all over the place. Little did I know that renovations were still in progress and were likely to be that way for a couple years to come.<br />
As we were about to get off our guides informed us that at the cathedral, there was a charge to take pictures, another charge for flash pictures and an even higher charge for renting a camera. I only heard the renting prices and made the stupid mistake of leaving my camera in the bus. As we walked towards the entrance, we glanced back to see our bus driver dancing in his seat. We had left the Doors in the player.<br />
There was a guard who made us all line up single file (she had surprisingly excellent English) and told us to watch our step as we went in. I quickly found out what she meant went I tripped on a step on the way in. Fortunately, I regained my balance quickly. Two seconds later, I found myself wanting to run back out to our bus and get my camera. Although this was the umpteenth church we had seen in the Soviet Union, this was the first to really catch my attention.<br />
The interior volume was in my opinion, a little less than ten times that of any other church we had been in. Where the other churches may have used paint to make an impression, St. Issac&#8217;s used gold and semiprecious stones (some of which were found to be lethal to exposed skin, which was known only after several of the craftsmen mysteriously dropped dead).<br />
As in all the other cathedrals, there was the iconostasis above the altar. But this one was much larger than any other we had seen before. The cathedral hadn&#8217;t had a service in it since World War Two. During that time, the building had been razed by fire, bombed and shot at. Through a determined effort, it was restored to it&#8217;s former glory. They had only finished the inside when we were there, the outside was still being worked on.<br />
As the church was now a historical site, small stands with pictures and models depicting the original construction and the restoration. The models depicted the raising of the columns in front and the multitude of logs that the cathedral sat on. Since Leningrad was founded on swampland, the base for something as massive as a cathedral had to be very strong. Despite the fact that I neglected to bring my camera, I still remember St. Issac&#8217;s very well. This is because it left a very big impression on me, and probably the others too.<br />
What really shook me was an impromptu concert by a choir group. All of the sudden, they broke out in song. I never did find out what they were singing, but with the acoustics in there, it sent chills down my spine.<br />
I&#8217;ll try to explain the place, so you have an idea of what I&#8217;m talking about (this is because people usually don&#8217;t). The main chamber is over twenty metres high, with three smaller chambers lying to the northern, western and southern sides. Directly above the main chamber is a kind of cupola, which supplies most of the outdoor light.<br />
At the eastern end is the iconostasis, altar and the priest&#8217;s chambers. The priest&#8217;s chamber is a small room just beyond the iconostasis. The only way in from the cathedral&#8217;s vestibule is through two large doors the reside in the middle, under a painting of Jesus.<br />
Following a half hour or so of looking and talking (mostly to myself, my comments went unheard by others), I exited through the north side, gandered at the columns that supported part of the roof, and went back to my bus.<br />
The bus driver was still hopping in his seat, but I didn&#8217;t take note of what was playing. Several others had bailed out of the cathedral before me. Couldn&#8217;t blame them either, after two weeks of religious institutions, I was kind of surprised no-one went nuts or something.<br />
We bopped to the tunes over the P.A. system until our guides returned with the remainder of the group. Then we headed out for our final destination in the Soviet Union, aside from the airport.<br />
It&#8217;s supposedly the largest BS shop in the Soviet Union, but the one is Moscow still seemed a big bigger. But I think no-one really cared, it was our last shot at a store before we left. It was time to stock up on a few things. The store had four or six divisions (it was a small even number), and we had two hours to take our time going through all of them.<br />
I had a promise to live up to, so I spent the first few minutes tracking down the food section. I found Pepsi, loads of it. For now, I thought, I&#8217;ll check out the rest of the place. I ran into just about everyone as I hopped from room to room, carefully mauling over everything in sight. I did find something in one room that I really wanted &#8230; more pins.<br />
A large sectioned tray had been laid out with about twenty to thirty different ones. It took me about ten minutes to sort through them all. When I was done, I had a two huge handfuls of them. When I went to buy them at the cash register, I just beat another American student by about two seconds or so. But I let her go first, she had a lot less to buy than I did. I rang up a total of ten dollars (Canadian) worth of pins. I was almost shocked at the amount, but then again, I did take a lot of them too.<br />
Pepsi was the next thing on my list, I had to pay off the Suhs as I had promised (to this date, I haven&#8217;t gone back on one). I picked up three and was about to go for two more when I saw Helen (it might have been Mina, I had a hard time remembering who was who) and took two of hers.<br />
I paid for the Pepsi (obviously) and returned the two bottles to the Suhs. Just as I was about to leave, I realized I needed a bottle opener. I quickly turned to the cashier and asked her about an opener. Actually, I just motioned it, I doubted she spoke English. She then handed me one from a small stack. I said &#8220;thank you&#8221; (in Russian) and left. It wasn&#8217;t until I got outside that I noticed the price stamped on the back and realized that I was supposed to pay for it. As no-one was coming after me, I guessed that either they didn&#8217;t care or I was wrong.<br />
Returning to the bus, I dropped off my Pepsi and my pins, grabbed my camera and went over to the water&#8217;s edge. The BS shop was next to a rather large Intourist hotel (as I said earlier, the good Intourist hotels were the ones we didn&#8217;t stay in) and only a couple hundred metres from the Gulf of Finland.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t a lot to take photos of, but I did get a good shot comparing on old Intourist bus to a new one. After that, I returned my camera to the bus and hauled myself over to the lobby of the hotel next to us. We were told to meet there for lunch. Most of the adults were already there, talking to a couple who were in the midst of their own travels. A small stand near them attracted most of the younger people. There we found several things that we wanted. The best part was that the ruble was the only accepted currency. This was a big benefit for us, we could get rid of as many rubles as there were things for us to buy. I bought as many pins as I could before I ran out of cash. Not long after, the rest of the group began to show up. At that point, I remembered what Greg had told a few of us earlier in the trip: &#8220;If you see anything with Aeroflot on it, let me know!&#8221; I found an Aeroflot pin.<br />
However, I bought the last single pin. All the others were mixed with still more pins in special books. I wanted one of them, but I couldn&#8217;t afford it. Greg took a collection from a group of us and came up with just enough for a book, at which point everyone who chipped in snitched their pins. Greg got his Aeroflot pin.<br />
Then we found out that we weren&#8217;t eating lunch at the hotel as we had thought. We had to go back to the bus. So we got up and headed back to the bus. Most of us didn&#8217;t even get past the door though, it was raining, hard. A couple of us were daring (or just stupid) enough to run back to the bus. I forgot what happens when jeans get wet. By the time I got back to the bus, I was pretty wet, not soaked, just severely dampened. Of course, knowing my luck, the bus then started up and went over to the hotel to pick the others up. After everyone had boarded the bus again, we headed down the ramp (the hotel&#8217;s main door was raised so a ramp was used to get at it) and headed towards the heart of Leningrad again. It was probably the first time that we didn&#8217;t care that it was raining. Hell, after all, we were leaving so what did it matter to us?<br />
The semi-familiar sight of the airport soon came into view. Our time in Leningrad and the Soviet Union was drawing to a close. We pulled up to the International terminal and unloaded our baggage, which porters then took inside. But we didn&#8217;t follow, not yet. First we had a luncheon to attend to. This was one thing that no-one complained about, we were all hungry. We were led into an adjoining building, up a flight of stairs and down a hall into the restaurant.<br />
Radar, Marina, Jason, Suzanna and myself made up a table, and food did not last long on it. We went through two or three bottles of Pepsi and one bottle of mineral water (which tasted like carbonated sea water again). After about half an hour, Suzanna stood up and let us know that we should begin to go back to the terminal. Very few of us even moved. Mr. Phillips, Andrew, KB, two to three others and myself comprised the first batch.<br />
We entered the terminal and went over to the mass of luggage and tried to pick out which were ours. &#8216;Twas no easy task either. After finding them, the next part was to go over to the check-in counter and get our bags put away. We were flying Finnair on the way out, so not only we were assured of a safe flight, but the check-in clerks spoke English. It was getting better by the minute. One-by-one we hauled our bags up on the scale and weighed them in.<br />
Now unlike in most other places, they did not take our luggage there. I was about to walk off when they told me to take it over to another area, where several people were already lined up. They were having their bags checked. But not physically, they ran them through large X-ray machines. The guards didn&#8217;t look into the bags unless they saw something suspicious. The guy ahead of me (who wasn&#8217;t in our group) had evidently done just that, his bags were being picked apart with a fine toothed comb.<br />
At the sight of this, every horror story and film I had seen that had portrayed something to this manner suddenly whipped through my head. I broke into a cold sweat as the guy ahead was finally waved on. Following the actions of the guard, my carryon bag and my larger one went on the X-ray machine&#8217;s conveyor belt. But I handed my camera bag for him to check. Seconds later, I had my camera bag back, along with my other two that had gone through the X-ray machine. The guard had barely even glanced at them. I was beside myself. I could have smuggled a Lada out (not like I really would have wanted one).<br />
But I didn&#8217;t get a chance to stand beside me for very long, I was quickly followed by (and started following) Mr. Phillips into passport control. But we didn&#8217;t get very far. The guards there told us to drop off our larger bags onto another conveyor belt that would eventually get them on the plane.<br />
Then came, as I already said, passport control. All the guard did was remove the remaining half of my visa, stamp it and wave me on. In under five minutes, I had literally exited the Soviet Union. It took us twice that time just to get in. I was kind of disappointed that I had gone through so easily. I was virtually expecting them to search my things. Jason did as well, and as a result put all his dirty (and odorous) clothes at the very top. I felt sorry for the guard who would open his (I found out later that Jason had as little trouble as I did).<br />
There was only one obstacle left, but I wasn&#8217;t worried about it. The metal detector is the least of my worries, I was through that in under ten seconds. Beyond that was the waiting lounge. Roughly 75 metres long and twenty metres wide, it wasn&#8217;t exactly the greatest place to wait for our flight.<br />
At the far end of the rectangular lounge sat the last Russian store I would go in. A duty free shop. Those always come in handy. I finally got to give up my film budgeting when I found some rolls of 36 exposure 400 speed Fuji film, the stuff I had already been using.<br />
Slowly but surely, the rest of the group began to filter in. I began to notice a startling similarity between our departure there and our departure from Toronto almost two weeks earlier. Our group was taking it&#8217;s time and there were a lot of other people taking up a lot of the space.<br />
Then the worst happened, I was practically expecting it, our flight was delayed. The surprising part was that most of the people in our group were also expecting it. Even with all man&#8217;s technical achievements, they still can&#8217;t get a plane to take off on time. The strange part was that although we were delayed, no-one seemed uptight about it. Either we had gotten used to it, or didn&#8217;t care whether or not we were late getting into Helsinki.<br />
During our extended stay in the airport terminal, many people from our group made a trip to the duty free shop. One could find almost anything in there, despite its small size. Helen and Mina Suh, Kara Lynn, Tammy, Jamie and a couple of others all bought Sony Walkmans. One thing I will say for the Soviet Union, they really don&#8217;t care about profit. Those walkmans cost over two hundred dollars in Canada at the time. They got them for about ninety. I almost bought one myself. Jason however, could not afford one. But with my help, bought a cheaper one (by some company I had never heard of). This single purchase brought silent cheers from some of us, namely those Jason had been borrowing walkmans from.<br />
A small group consisting of Chris, Jeremy and Sasha (maybe another couple, but I didn&#8217;t see them) got their hands on guitars and the Russian version thereof and played to their hearts content.<br />
I spent my time setting the clocks on the Sony Walkmans for the Suhs and Kara Lynn. I don&#8217;t know why, but for some odd reason, most of the females I know are completely illiterate about electronics.<br />
Finally our plane was announced as boarding. At this news, almost every person in that lobby stood up and rushed to the door. It took a long time to finally get everyone out that door. We couldn&#8217;t all get out at one time, we had to wait for a bus to come, pick us up and haul us out to the plane.<br />
A sole Finnair DC9 sat out on the runway. All around it sat almost every imaginable type of military aircraft. Several of us wanted to whip out our cameras but we knew that if we tried, and a guard caught us, we wouldn&#8217;t see Canada for some time.<br />
Pretty well everyone in our group was seated in the rear of the plane (which made sense). I can&#8217;t remember who I was seated with, but it was a short flight anyway. I do know that I was on a window seat. Just as we were beginning to move out, Derek (a couple of seats back) began to quietly shout (how&#8217;s that for an oxymoron?) about something. A MiG fighter was taxiing out behind us. He quickly whipped out his camera and told everyone to make a simultaneous sneeze or cough to muffle the noise.<br />
The flight was a good one, all the preflight instructions were in English, something which I noticed that we didn&#8217;t get when we flew on Aeroflot. Of course, then again, Aeroflot had reportedly never crashed. That never comforted anyone. Then we began our time travel. We landed in Helsinki five minutes before we even left Leningrad. Sounds confusing doesn&#8217;t it? For those of you who don&#8217;t really know geography very well, there&#8217;s a time line between Leningrad and Helsinki (Helsinki&#8217;s an hour behind Leningrad) and the flight was 55 minutes.<br />
When we took to the air, I mumbled a final good bye in Russian (yeah I know it&#8217;s corny, but I&#8217;m telling the story!). On our way out, some of us on the right side of the plane noticed a Russian Bear (large Soviet bomber) &#8220;escorting&#8221; us out.<br />
Less than an hour later, we were landing in Helsinki on the same runway we had landed on the first time. Following the same routine that we had followed for the past two weeks in regards to airplanes, we had to wait for another bus to come pick us up. We all crammed ourselves on the bus (not all at one time, that would have been impossible), we were whisked across the tarmac to the same entrance we had gone through almost two weeks previous. As we were disembarking, I couldn&#8217;t resist saying..<br />
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this where we came in?&#8221; Talk about dÃ¯ ¿ ½ja vu.<br />
This time however, we weren&#8217;t going back upstairs to the terminal. We continued along the ground to passport control and luggage pickup. There were two distinct lines: one marked in red, for people who had things to declare and another marked green, for those who either didn&#8217;t have anything or those who didn&#8217;t want to declare it!<br />
Needless to say, we went through the green. I was kind of expecting a repeat of the treatment we got in Moscow. Was I surprised! All the guards (there were two or three in the booth) did was take a quick look at me, stamp my passport and bid welcome. No questions asked.<br />
Then came the fun part, finding our luggage. Some people (Mr. Phillips for one) never seemed to take long doing that. For some reason mine always takes awhile just to get off the plane. But I soon joined the others outside in the lower lobby. During our wait for the others, some of us who had accumulated went over to a bank stand (an actual teller) and exchanged their dollars (rubles are worthless everywhere, including the Soviet Union) into Finnish marks.<br />
When everyone had finally accumulated in our group, we headed outside to find our bus. For some reason, we all followed Radar. It felt a little weird as we normally followed our guides, KB or Mr. Phillips. But Radar seemed to know where he was going. My attention was temporarily lost though, as we walked through the parking lot. I nearly wept. I finally saw some real vehicles! Not shoeboxes on wheels but real cars like Beemers, Mercedes-Benzes, Saabs, Fords and the odd Jaguar!<br />
Our bus was an even greater surprise! We didn&#8217;t get something like the Russian buses we had used (not like we weren&#8217;t used to them), but we got a Eurobus! This was the true definition of coach! We threw our bags in the bus (no more porters) and quickly got on, to try and get the best seats. Those of us who were really fast got to the back of the bus, the best place.<br />
Greg, of course, was one of us along with Lisa V, Jason and myself. That was all I could see, I was on the window. Greg spotted the sunroof (sunroof?) just above him and stood on his seat to open it. He wanted to stay up there for the entire trip to the hotel.<br />
We began to pull out towards downtown Helsinki, where we would find our hotel, sleep, shopping and if we were lucky, McDonald&#8217;s! We all wanted to know where that was and even before we got out of the airport parking lot, someone (maybe even all of us) shouted &#8230;<br />
&#8220;WHERE&#8217;S THE MCDONALD&#8217;S?!?&#8221;<br />
Unfortunately, Suzanna didn&#8217;t know right off. But she did promise to find out for us as soon as she could. Well, it was better than nothing. Most of us were starving for something we readily recognized.<br />
On the beach at Sochi, a quick catching virus began amongst all of us. It was called the &#8220;WhatI&#8217;mGoing-toEatWhenIGetHome Fever&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t dangerous, just annoying as several people kept repeating themselves. Jason must have planned his out even before we left Canada. He wanted to make a beeline for Tim Horton&#8217;s to get, and I quote, &#8220;a coffee, black, no sugar or cream and a Boston Creme donut&#8221;. That&#8217;s how often he said it. Kelly Hogan wanted to hit every chicken joint she could think of. Didn&#8217;t blame her either, after two weeks of fish I could have gone for some poultry myself.<br />
As we entered the highway, one of Mr. Phillips&#8217; cassettes from his vast collection ended up in the tape deck. On it were tunes from the sixties and seventies. One of them practically became our tour theme &#8230; American Pie. Why? Beats me, I didn&#8217;t even like the song until then.<br />
Then suddenly, someone spotted something through the dense evergreens. A sign. A red sign. A red sign with a golden arch. Almost the entire bus jumped up and ran over to the left side to get a better view. It was only a McDonald&#8217;s highway sign, written in Finnish. Everyone sat down, kind of dejected that it was not a restaurant. Greg however didn&#8217;t. He grabbed Lisa V&#8217;s camera (still looped around her neck) and ran over to the window to take pictures of it.<br />
When we finally got into Helsinki, everyone went on a McDonald&#8217;s alert. Everyone (except the adults I should add) was trying to spot the arches and remember where they were. At first I was doing it too, but then I remembered a little known fact about Raunchy Ron&#8217;s: the only place you will see those huge arches is in North America. In Europe, those are considered too much of an eyesore. Even in downtown Quebec City, there are no arches despite the McDonald&#8217;s. All there that you see is a small dark green sign with bronze arches on them. And they&#8217;re hard to spot.<br />
After going down enough back streets, we finally arrived at our hotel, the name of which escapes me. Here we piled off and dragged out all our luggage. Then came the fun part, trying to get a room. We were told that it was four to a room. Pete, Shaun and myself spontaneously joined up. But they wouldn&#8217;t let us take a room without a fourth. Jason was still without a room, so I grabbed him. We really didn&#8217;t have much of a choice so there was only a quick argument on it. I won.<br />
We got our room, on the eighth floor of the eight floor hotel and headed for the first elevator. There were only three of them, two of them could only hold two people and the third was a service elevator, which could hold four. The elevators themselves were really awesome, they had no doors. It was a box, with the front and back open. You could see the walls move by as you went up.<br />
We were the only ones on that floor. Other than us, every room was empty. We found our room, and the double doors that they had (probably for security or something). We raced in and grabbed our beds. Shaun and I grabbed singles against the walls, Pete and Jason had the two beds that had been placed sidebyside.<br />
Before we did anything else we trashed the room. All the heavy covers were on the floor in a second, the lamp by Shaun&#8217;s bed was tipped over (gently), books scattered, etc. When we were finished, it looked like World War Three. We felt like we were at home. Despite my luck with the bed, I lost out on dibs for showers, I was last. But this gave me time to watch, of all things, The Flintstones on TV. The English was still there (English is a major language there) but there were Finnish subtitles underneath.<br />
As I was last for the shower, I made a quick decision to avoid dinner. When we found the map to guide us to McD&#8217;s (supplied by Suzanna), I knew what I was going to eat, and it wasn&#8217;t to be found at our hotel. Besides, by the time I got out, dinner was virtually over.<br />
A small group of us (Pete, Kelly B, Sonya, Shaun, Jamie and yours truly) took it to find the illusive home of the Big Mac. So we made a drunken beeline for it. I say drunken because we really didn&#8217;t figure it out right away. We quickly found ourselves kind of lost. We knew where we were, but we had no idea where McD&#8217;s was. Fortunately, we ran into a couple of Finnish girls who kind of gave us directions. But at least we knew we were going in the right direction.<br />
When we reached the next corner, we ran into Anita and group. She began to tell us that it had closed. She managed to convince Jamie, but not me. First off, if the McDonald&#8217;s around the world function the same way that they did North America, they wouldn&#8217;t close until about midnight. Second, my nose can sniff out a Filet O&#8217; Fish a mile away.<br />
So those of us who remained (all but Jamie) proceeded down a street perpendicular to the one we had come down. Sure enough, the green and bronze sign popped out from the wall. We had found our target. Just as we were about to enter, I got a sudden fear when I realized that the menu would probably be in Finnish. Luckily, my fears were for not, the signs (with a few exceptions) were in English.<br />
Then we all gave in to one huge Big Mac Attack! I ordered the most in the group (I was the only one not to have dinner at the hotel). My dinner consisted of a Big Mac, large fries, cheeseburger, milkshake and a sundae. It was expensive though, the total was the equivalent of fifteen dollars Canadian. But I didn&#8217;t care, it was food that I recognized and liked.<br />
As we sat, three of us got further nourishment with our eyes. Finland has some of the most beautiful women I had ever seen (aside from the girls on our trip of course there&#8217;s a suck up if I ever heard one). Pete, Shaun and I all went gaga. Shaun began chanting &#8220;dead puppies&#8221;. At first I had totally forgotten about that until Sonya asked what he was doing. Everyone else already knew, so we filled her in. From her expression on her face, I didn&#8217;t know if she was shocked or amused.<br />
About ten minutes after we had begun to eat Kim, Lisa P and Jason showed up. They ate considerably lighter than me. Jason had no cash left, so Kim paid for him. Nice of her wasn&#8217;t it? Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, say no more!<br />
Following our light to heavy dinner, our group headed out to explore the Helsinki night life, leaving Kim, Lisa P and Jason behind, they didn&#8217;t want to come. We found a designated crossover and headed to a large complex across the street. It was a huge commercial complex with stores, a Pizza Hut (if I had known about that, I would have skipped McD&#8217;s), and several bars. This interested Pete. In order to get near them, we had to get through a group of skate punks. Even Europe isn&#8217;t safe from the disease. And these idiots were a hundred times worse than those back in Canada. Their idea of art was the shoddiest job of graffiti I had ever seen in my life.<br />
We went up a set of stairs to the third or fourth level, where the bars were. Almost immediately, one of them caught Pete&#8217;s attention and we headed right for it. But before we had gone four steps, Pete stopped.<br />
&#8220;Uh oh, forget it, that dude&#8217;s too big!&#8221;<br />
Let me put it this way, the bouncer, the &#8220;dude&#8221; Pete was referring to, could have creamed Arnold Schwarzenegger with both arms tied behind his back. Now that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but then again, it has been a year since it happened! We avoided that one. At the next one, we not only found Chris, Konrad and Mike but we lost Pete and Kelly, who disappeared into its depths for about five minutes. I really didn&#8217;t feel like going in, I felt kind of sick. That&#8217;s the only problem with fast food, it sinks to the bottom of my stomach and solidifies.<br />
So when Pete came back out to drag everyone else in, I told them to have a good time and headed back for the hotel. The side of the complex we were on emptied out onto the street we had come up from the hotel. But that didn&#8217;t stop me from almost getting lost.<br />
I still can&#8217;t get over it. I got lost twice in two weeks. I never get lost. The last time I got lost was when I was five and couldn&#8217;t find my way out of a maze at Ontario Place. Even though I was several years older, the last thing I wanted to do was get lost in another city that I didn&#8217;t know, that little thought gave me the creeps.<br />
I never really got lost, I just got scared for a moment that I was. I quickly figured out what way to go. Soon, I found myself in my room, preparing for bed. I knew I couldn&#8217;t go to sleep however, I was the only one with a key and the doors were self locking. For about an hour, all I did was look out the window, write my journal entry (which is forthcoming) and watched some Australian movie. I had no idea what was going on, I came in at about the middle of it and got lost in the plot.<br />
Despite the fact that I was supposed to wait up for the others, I began to fall asleep. But just as I was about to drop off, a loud knocking came at the door. Opening it, I found myself face to face with Pete, Kelly, Kim, Jason, Sonya and Shaun. This was when I found out how expensive the drinks were. That&#8217;s why they came back, Pete was short on cash. So after five minutes, they left for the bar again, this time taking the key with them.<br />
Less than five minutes later, there was another knock at the door. Just as I was about to open the inner door, there were a bunch of them. I opened the inner door and was about to reach for the outer door&#8217;s handle but found myself looking at the others again.<br />
&#8220;Very funny.&#8221; I mumbled.<br />
They gave up on the bar. The drinks were too much and lights out wasn&#8217;t far off anyway. So in order to keep us interested until we fell asleep, we all grabbed positions in the room and talked. Shaun and I took our beds, Sonya took one of the two chairs, Pete and Kelly sat on Pete&#8217;s bed leaving Kim and Jason to unwind on Jason&#8217;s bed. Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, say no more! While we were talking, the subject somehow changed to Dead Baby jokes. Actually, it&#8217;s fairly simple. Normal jokes come around first, and then someone in the group has to come up with the infamous &#8220;Dead something&#8221; joke. In our case, it was Shaun.<br />
&#8220;Why do you put a baby in a blender feet first?&#8221; asked Shaun. We all knew the answer, but did not bother to say anything.<br />
&#8220;To see the expression on its face!!&#8221; continued Shaun, who then went &#8220;AHHHHH!&#8221; at the top of his lungs while simultaneously wrenching his face into an outrageous configuration that caused the rest of us to laugh ourselves silly.<br />
Now I know that sounds sick, the thought of it is kind of disgusting, but the way Shaun tells it is enough to make your sides split.<br />
Within fifteen minutes, Kelly was sound asleep. Not terribly surprising, we were all tired. But the rest of us didn&#8217;t stop talking. We yapped for quite a long time to, until a knock at the door came at about eleven.<br />
&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Jason.<br />
&#8220;Lights out!&#8221; came a muffled voice through the door. It sounded like KB. Everyone except Kelly sprang into action.<br />
&#8220;SHIT!&#8221; I whispered loudly.<br />
&#8220;HIDE!&#8221; whispered someone to the girls (they weren&#8217;t supposed to be in our room in the first place &#8212; another rule that we continued to ruthlessly break).<br />
&#8220;Turn the lights off!&#8221; whispered someone else. Jason and I made our way to the doors, opening them carefully. We lucked out that time, it wasn&#8217;t KB. IT was Mr. Hanson and Mr. Howard. I heard a few sighs of relief, one of which was mine, I think. I&#8217;m pretty sure that they knew that girls were in there, but I highly doubt that they cared. They knew that we were responsible (yeah, right!) and wouldn&#8217;t try anything. The only reason it was them was they knew that we were the only ones up there. They said good night and left.<br />
The lights remained out after that. Everyone, except poor Sonya (who was still in the chair) had reclined to a horizontal position. Kelly was still sound asleep and the rest of us were following fast. But being the pain in the ass that I was at the time, I couldn&#8217;t resist a picture. Focusing in the dark was hard, but I knew basically where I had to shoot. A couple of them heard the whine on my flash, but I denied hearing anything. Hee hee.<br />
FLASH! Everyone, except Kelly, started shouting at me. They were blinded, so was I for that matter, there was a mirror on the other wall that reflected some of the light. But that didn&#8217;t stop Shaun from trying to attack me with the lamp next to his bed. He didn&#8217;t get far (thank God), the cord was too short.<br />
Soon after, Kim decided to head for her own room so she could get in before everyone else fell asleep. Ten minutes later, Sonya dragged Kelly out of the room too, leaving just the four of us again. Pete, Jason and I however, could not sleep. We just kept talking. I mentioned that no-one was to clean up the room until I got a picture of it. One of my other two conscious roommates suggested getting one in the dark. Why not?<br />
I set the flash and self timer and the rest of us (except Shaun, who had told us to &#8220;f&#8211;k off!&#8221;) promptly crashed out in some unusual positions. Pete lumped himself in a chair, Jason draped the curtains over his head and I plopped on the bed, allowing myself to fall between the cracks.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
FINALLY!! Some REAL food! After arriving in Helsinki, Pete, Shaun, Jason and myself ran to our rooms and had a shower. While one took a shower, the rest of us watched The Flintstones in English (Finnish subtitles). Then we all went to McDonald&#8217;s were I ate too much (again!). Now I don&#8217;t mind Russian food, actually, I like most of it, but after a while, I could kill for a hamburger. Tomorrow is going to be a long day so I have returned to our room for some sleep while the rest party hardy.

<em>Day 13</em><br />
WHERE THE HELL IS THE PEPSI?!? This question was asked many times last night and today. Everyone is thirsty and the BS shop doesn&#8217;t have any Pepsi. All they have is booze and tonic water. Soon I will be too desperate to care. At this moment, we are headed for Petrodvorets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I forgot Jason wasn&#8217;t with me that night. It scared the hell of me for a second, but then I got my bearings again. I fumbled around for the alarm (which was driving me crazy with its incessant beeping) and turned it off. I was about to lay back and to some mental discussion as to what the hell I was doing in a Communist country (good timing there eh?) when I remembered that Pete and Shaun had asked me to wake them up, as they didn&#8217;t have an alarm between us.<br />
Pete and Shaun were in a room together. Think my prophecy of Derek and Pete taking a dislike for each other came true? At first I though so, but I was later informed that passports got mixed up and Derek ended up with Greg by accident. Although that was the beginning of a trend.<br />
I knocked on the door five times with my hand, and twice with my head (I usually do this with my sister). A couple seconds later, a weary Shaun was staring at me, probably wondering what I was doing.<br />
&#8220;Good morning, this is your seven o&#8217;clock alarm call!&#8221; I said cheerily. Shaun looked at me, then looked at Pete, then looked back at me.<br />
&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; he said, closing the door. I was expecting something a bit wittier than that, but after all, he had just got up.<br />
I was about to take a shower when I remembered the water. Our guides said it was safe so long as we keep our mouths closed and our eyes shut. No good for me. The next shower I would see was in Helsinki.<br />
I took a look out the window, hoping to see a decent day. Boy, was I fooled. It was Moscow all over again. The only good thing to come out of the weather that day was the fact that it didn&#8217;t rain. At about eight, we all grouped down in the lobby for breakfast. We expected to have a restaurant in the hotel, but were surprised to find that there wasn&#8217;t one. Our breakfast was awaiting us at a small restaurant just at the other end of our rather lengthy driveway.<br />
As usual, they had set off an area just for us, just as the other hotels had done (it made it easier to find a place to sit down and eat!). The cheese and salami were waiting. Then came the eggs (eggs and cheese combined) that was as usual, revolting. As a bit of a bonus, there were raisin buns. But few people ate them, mainly because of the way Lisa P described them..<br />
&#8220;These aren&#8217;t raisin buns, they&#8217;re cockroach buns!&#8221; she shouted. Just what we needed to hear first thing in the morning.<br />
After breakfast, we went directly to our buses. We had been warned of this and had brought down the stuff we were going to need. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t have the same buses that we had the day before, the blue and white Italian special wasn&#8217;t there. Our trip that morning took us to Petrodvorets, more commonly known as the site of the Summer Palace. It&#8217;s not far from Leningrad, but it still takes a while to get there.<br />
When Peter the Great founded St. Petersburg (the first name of Leningrad) back in the early 1700&#8217;s, he wanted a palace he could go to so that he could get away from the city, yet still be able to over look things. He had his palace erected in Petrodvorets. It&#8217;s the smallest of all the palaces but it&#8217;s also one of the nicest in my opinion. There isn&#8217;t a lot of junk kicking around. Very simple, that&#8217;s the way I like &#8217;em.<br />
When we arrived, the guide on our bus (who was much shorter than me, pretty nonetheless) instructed us to follow her and make sure that we didn&#8217;t loose her. This was good advice considering the large parking lot was filled with fifty or more tour buses. Not only that, but the entire complex as a whole was gigantic, and packed with people.<br />
A few minutes later, we were staring down the middle of the entire maze, looking right onto the Gulf of Finland. From where we were, I could see fountains, hundreds of them, all over the place. The palace grounds were studded with so many fountains that one would think that the ground would mud instead of soil.<br />
The strange part about the fountains is that not one of them has a pump. All the fountains are powered by the pull of gravity (how&#8217;s that for a contradiction?). The entire area is on a slope (although you really can&#8217;t see it) and the falling motion is enough to propel the water to heights as great as fifty feet.<br />
We then went down the staircase to the lower gardens, where all the fountains are. Our guide tried to explain something, but I didn&#8217;t hear her, I was too busy trying to keep us with all the people. It was then I saw why she wanted us to be careful. wall-to-wall tourists. We progressed down the walkway that ran on one side of the canal which also ran down the middle of the complex. When we got to the first bridge, our entire group flocked on for pictures. From the bridge, you can take a picture of the main palace from over the canal. The pictures that one takes from that position are almost identical to hundreds upon thousands of others, the bridge floor was worn where all the tourists had taken pictures.<br />
Then we disappeared into the forest. Scattered amongst the clearings are small buildings, more fountains, and the odd palace. It didn&#8217;t take us long to find Peter the Great&#8217;s old pad. The Romanovs had an unusual sense of humour. Of all the 144 fountains in the courtyard, there were three that were actually booby traps. The amazing part were all the boobies who couldn&#8217;t stay away from them!<br />
The first that we saw was one on the corner of Pete&#8217;s palace. It looks nothing more than a patch of small stones that were just scattered there. But along the edges are two rows of nozzles. Step on the wrong stones and you get soaked. There is a permanent wall of people around it laughing at other people dumb enough to get onto the patch.<br />
Not far up from that one was the most impressive fountain I saw. Even up close (as close as you can get without getting wet) the Oak Tree Fountain looks like a real oak tree, though it&#8217;s made entirely of metal. To make such a tree today would probably put you into the millions of dollars (not to mention stiff upkeep rates).<br />
In the same area as the Oak Tree Fountain was another of the booby trapped fountains. This was a larger version of the one we saw back at Pete&#8217;s palace, but it had the same effect. Step in the wrong place, and your socks get soggy (not to mention the rest of you). Just across the way was the last of the booby traps. But this one looked nothing like the previous two. This had a small circular deck with a post in the centre. On this post rested the roof, giving it the appearance of a merry-go-round minus the horses. I have no idea how this one worked (like I had an idea how the others worked!). If someone stands in the wrong place or too many people got on one side, there was a sudden rush of water from the edge of the roof. A wall of water all around the edge of the roof. If you tried to get out, you got wet. A couple from our group got on, and soon regretted that they had done so.<br />
Our tour of the lower gardens continued. We saw a fountain which looked more like an oversized chess board tipped on its side, but I didn&#8217;t ask our guide about it. I decided not to bother. We also saw dueling turtles. Not Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but two fountains that spat water (I think at each other, but I&#8217;m not sure, it wasn&#8217;t working at the time).<br />
I wanted to take a picture, but a quick examination of my film stock showed me that I had only a roll and a half of film left. Until I got some more, I had to be careful what I took pictures of. Unfortunately, not many Soviet stores stock Fuji film (the only film I liked using at the time).<br />
Soon, we were back at our bus, heading back for lunch. It took us some time to finally get everyone on, but soon we were on our way. Having two buses was a blast, I could easily bother Lisa V. She hated having her picture taken so all I had to do was point my camera at her when our bus pulled up next to theirs. After a while of just faking it, I did actually take one, but she ducked before the shutter opened.<br />
Our bus made a quick side trip on the way back, to get a good look at a cathedral that was fairly close to the Summer Palace. It was in the traditional Russian Orthodox style, and not in any of the tour books. So everyone on our bus rushed off, took a picture, and then rushed back on.<br />
Lunch was nothing out of the ordinary, aside from what we had to drink. We usually had two choices, one of which was often Pepsi. There was none here. Instead we had mineral water (that was the other usual) and what someone told me was Cabbage Beer. The mineral water in most places we had been was fairly good, but this stuff tasted like carbonated salt water. Despite my dislike of alcohol, I went for the beer. I had reached that point where I was too thirsty to care.<br />
Following our lunch, it was back to touring. Another afternoon, another palace. But this time we didn&#8217;t have to leave Leningrad to find it. Although today it goes by the name of Hermitage, it used to be known as the Winter Palace. It&#8217;s one of the largest art museums in the world. Hell, the museum itself is art.<br />
We had to go around the front of the palace and down a back alley to get to the Intourist entrance. It actually made quite a bit of sense to have an Intourist door separate from the conventional door, it would have taken us hours to get in had we gone in the front. As it was, the back door was much faster.<br />
While we were outside, it gave us a very good look at one of the most famous sites in the Soviet Union. It&#8217;s called Victory Square for a good reason. On a cold November night in 1917, a small group of group of Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, stormed the Winter Palace, claiming control of what was then Russia. Although it has been over-glorified into a storm of soldiers engaged in a gigantic life and death battle for supremacy, the overthrow was tame and quick.<br />
We finally got in after about a half hour wait. At first there really wasn&#8217;t much to see at all. It looked about as boring as the parliament buildings in Ottawa. But when we got to the top of the first set of stairs, hoo boy! Now that&#8217;s what I call a palace. I had never seen so much gold in all my life. I probably never will again. But it was impressive, noone could deny that!<br />
Although the tour took most of the afternoon, it was a quick tour, and we didn&#8217;t even get to all the rooms. There were few areas that didn&#8217;t have art on them somewhere. Some rooms didn&#8217;t have a lot in them, but that was because the room itself was more impressive than the art that it contained. If I meet an alien one day who wants to see samples from all the great masters, even the not-so-great, I&#8217;ll refer him to the Hermitage. If you can&#8217;t find at least one painting of a particular artist in there, whoever it is never painted that well.<br />
There are a few that I don&#8217;t remember seeing. Picasso for one. I think most of the artists in there didn&#8217;t do abstract. All the art in there is very much down to earth. Of course, I didn&#8217;t get to all the rooms, such as I have mentioned, so I could be wrong.<br />
The tour was pleasant, even though I&#8217;m not a real art lover. I think that for the most part, everyone else in the group liked it too. The only that I know that none of us liked, the heat. It was unbearably hot in there that day, although it was cool outside. I found it maybe a bit puzzling that they let it get that warm. There were no fire sprinklers, no extinguishers. Combine that with all those oil paintings, oh brother, do you have a fire hazard! The value of all that artwork must be incalculable.<br />
We finally ended our tour, but were advised to look around a bit more, if we wanted to. A small handful of us took a quick look in a couple rooms and then went outside to get some fresh air. We were outside for about a half hour before our bus drivers returned and we got back on. Then, of course, we headed back to the hotel.<br />
The tour left us with a bit of time left before dinner. A few people took off to parts unknown. Some people returned to trading. The locals were always around. Jason, Kim and myself tracked down something to drink. When we were in Sochi, Jason had bought a couple bottles of concentrated orange flavouring. We poured this into cans of tonic water. The initial taste wasn&#8217;t bad, but the aftertaste was a killer. It certainly wasn&#8217;t Old South.<br />
I stuck my nose into the bar next door, were I managed to find a real orange drink. I state drink, as it wasn&#8217;t juice of any kind, although it was much better than the orange flavoured tonic water. It got rid of the aftertaste, but we had to hang onto the bottles because the bartender wouldn&#8217;t let us pitch them in his garbage.<br />
I quickly found Pete and Shaun, who were engrossed in some serious discussions with some traders. I stuck my nose in to see what he was up to. Pepsi shirts. Whoopee. But at least they looked good, there were some really bad looking t-shirts that we traded for at one point or another.<br />
The three of us began to look around to see what else we could find. What we ran into were two of the most stunning Soviet women we had ever seen. Not a visible cavity or lost tooth, no lost hair. Perfect English to boot. They were offering lacquered boxes, among numerous other things. We were more interested in talking than anything else. I also suspected that they also did a few other services on the side that they didn&#8217;t normally advertise. Beautiful women in the Soviet Union seem to end up as prostitutes all too often.<br />
Our dinner time soon rolled around. It was the final one for us. We still had a breakfast and lunch to go, but that was the last evening meal we had there. It was typical for dinner, as far as dinners went, except for our dessert. When we were in Sochi, Mr. Findlay received the gift of a watermelon from a little girl and her mother (I assume he did something for them) and he was just so nice as to share it with all 46 of us. The sucker was so big, it went around without any problem at all.<br />
Following our dinner, we went over to the stairs in the front of our hotel for group picture time. I neglected to bring my camera though. It really didn&#8217;t matter, in all my shots I have at least one picture of each person on the trip. While we kept our places, people kept passing up their cameras for pictures. I thought of going up to get mine, but I decided against it. I could always get a reprint from someone else.<br />
I could have gone though. We had to wait a long time before we could start while Greg and Derek got their cameras. Wonder why it took them so long? The maids caught them when they went up. What did they do? Five minutes after they had gotten into the room, everything except the beds had been turned on its side.<br />
Just as the photo session ended, most of our group took off to parts unknown. The twenty or so of us left were informed that one last blast of cultural stuff was up. And it was mandatory that we go, no ifs, ands or buts about it. As there were only about twenty, we only needed one bus. But I did take my camera. I thought that it might prove to be interesting. Besides, I had high speed film in case there was a lack of light.<br />
So the twenty of us filed on to our bus and disappeared into the depths on Leningrad. We crossed a few bridges over some canals, then over one on the Neva to the north side. A few minutes later, we found ourselves among dozens of other buses. At this point, we stopped as we had arrived at our destination.<br />
The building didn&#8217;t look any different from the apartment buildings nearby, except for the ticket booth. We had to wait for a moment while Suzanna fixed something with the ticket agent, but then we went right in, through the very small lobby into the auditorium. Our seats were somewhere in the back, but the auditorium was small enough for us to be able to see quite well. When the lights went out, I was delighted that I had high speed film too. We were too far for a flash.<br />
The show was put on by a troupe of dancers from Siberia. They were all from the Siberian area (of course) and traveled all over the Soviet Union, much like a circus show. That was what some of their show was like too. During the show, some of us made some interesting observations. For example, one of the dancers looked an awful lot like Greg. Those of us who noticed that then noted that the reason that he wasn&#8217;t with us was that he was dancing in the show. In all reality, he was probably at some dance hall.<br />
I took a few pictures during the show (which turned out rather well too, I might add), but as I was still budgeting my film use, I kept it to a minimum. About fifteen minutes later, we were back at our hotel. As a reward for going to the show, we were given a later curfew, though I doubt any of us used it.<br />
We were soon trading again with the locals. I made a deal with the kid the night before for him to bring more pins. He did, and I traded off the rest of my bubble gum. All the pins I had traded for had prices stamped on the back, and after some quick conversions, I found that I had saved about $10. If the kid had been a few years older, I doubt I would have been so lucky.<br />
Shaun was going insane. It was probably the last time we would get to trade and he was determined to get his hands on as much military gear as he could. He was involved with the navy back in Canada, so his focus was on his Soviet counterparts. We was moving from trader to trader at such a speed I think the traders probably thought that Shaun was taking speed.<br />
Somewhere around eleven (I think, it was still very bright out) I retired to my room, for my last sleep in the Soviet Union. As I was listening to my Walkman, I noticed something rather odd. My Walkman has a nasty habit of buzzing when a radio (turned on of course) is nearby. It buzzed near my pillow, a chair and a section in the wall. I was tempted to find out why, but instead of shredding something, I just assumed I was being bugged and mumbled for a half hour.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
The Summer Palace was mind boggling with all those fountains (some of which were booby trapped). The Winter Palace (now formally known as the Hermitage) was even more impressive and very, very elaborate. Not to mention very, very warm.Tonight, some of us saw a really interesting dance troupe. It was more interesting that I originally thought it would be. Too bad not everyone came.

<em>Day 12</em><br />
If you&#8217;re wondering what happened to Day 11, it was spent trying to figure what the hell happened to this journal. Two nights ago, I gave the journal to Greg the Wonder Dummy to have it marked. He supposedly gave it to KB but he never got it. It was a total waste of time. There was nothing happening but there was no curfew so just about everyone made a beeline for the Heinekin Bar, including me (no drinks though).<br />
Today was nothing special. But the BS shops have really got to work on their act. It took me two trips to get what I wanted. Well, time for dinner.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not remember much from Day 11, as far as my journal and my first version of this book goes, it&#8217;s part of Day 12. The morning of Day 11 was spent down at the beach of all places soaking up more rays. Beyond that, I&#8217;m not sure if anything special happened.<br />
When lunch rolled around, we were informed that we had to have our journals passed to either Greg or KB himself that day for marking. Yes, there were many feverish writers that day. I on the other hand was up to date and had no worries &#8230; yet. Before lunch ended, I sprinted up to my room, grabbed my journal (simultaneously lobbing a bun at my partially deceased roommate) and tore back down to the restaurant.<br />
Greg was still there, taking orders for t-shirts (which I was an order) and little rubber squeaky pigs. Don&#8217;t even ask! I didn&#8217;t want to find that out myself. Anyway, I gave him my journal. I should have told him &#8220;BE CAREFUL&#8221;. There had been nothing planned that day so I returned to the beach with the others. For awhile at least. I could feel the skin on my body become increasingly warm, even when it was covered. To an experienced sun burner, this was a good sign to cut out before it got any worse.<br />
When I returned to the room, I spent my time trying to get a hold of Greg. I not only wanted to find out if he found any shirts but if he had my journal. I didn&#8217;t know that he&#8217;d misplaced it yet, but I needed it. For some bizarre reason, KB decided that we were to have a talent show that night. Yes, we were to supply the talent. I can&#8217;t sing, dance or play an instrument. Reciting Monty Python never crossed my mind but I could write good poems. For that though, I needed my journal.<br />
That&#8217;s when I found out that Greg had lost it. Though Greg had said that he had given all the journals to KB, I knew that KB hadn&#8217;t lost it. Teachers don&#8217;t do that (usually). Greg had also failed to get me a t-shirt. It wasn&#8217;t really his fault, the store had run out, but I was in snotty mood anyway.<br />
While I was out on the porch doing God knows what, we got a knock on the door. As Jason was still comatose, I went to see who it was. None other than Mr. Phillips. He was personally passing a book around which we were going to give to Suzanna. It was a large book on Canada full of pictures. I signed it and we managed to get Jason to do so as well. Mr. Phillips was also taking a collection for Marina. Five rubles each was all he asked.<br />
I think Mr. Phillips was disappointed at Jason, for being sick. I&#8217;m almost positive that he linked to Jason&#8217;s drinking. I was going to explain that there were others who drank even more than Jason and were fine and chances were that it was food poisoning. But I didn&#8217;t.<br />
After a while, I went over to the TV. We had watched a bit from time to time, if any English bits came on or Gorby was on (that&#8217;s how I got my only photo of him). We flipped through all six channels until we came across something rather interesting. We must have timed it well, we found Red Heat, with Arnie Schwarzenegger himself. We came in just as it started. Throughout the film, except for the parts that were in Russian to begin with, there was a single man doing all the translation. The Soviets really have to work on their dubbing, we could still hear all the English in the background.<br />
That took us up right to dinner. Jason stayed behind though, he was still to ill to eat. At dinner, I noticed that Mr. Phillips and his entourage were not eating much. That&#8217;s when I found out that Mr. Phillips had spent more rubles buying eight or so whole roast chickens. He ate one by himself. So would I if I had the opportunity to eat one.<br />
Following dinner was, as scheduled, the talent show. For this we had to go to a Roman style building just up the hill from our hotel. It was easily within walking distance. But we didn&#8217;t go in. We just stayed on the stairs. Then the performances began.<br />
Jeremy had prepared a poem, which was quite humourous (I would have liked have done the same, but my journal was still in limbo). He&#8217;s the only other one besides a duo that stand out in my mind, I can&#8217;t remember the few who did preform. There weren&#8217;t many. The best group I think was the duo of Greg and Toni. Greg wore his Russian bicycling cap and a military jacket while Toni sported the matching hat. Why they wore them I&#8217;m not sure, but their little song was a riot.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Perestroika, perestroika,<br />
Glastnost too! Glastnost too!<br />
Gorby&#8217;s got a problem, Gorby&#8217;s got a problem,<br />
Lenin too, Lenin too.<br />
Perestroika, perestroika,<br />
Glastnost too! Glastnost too!<br />
Gorby&#8217;s got a funny head, Gorby&#8217;s got a funny head,<br />
and Lenin&#8217;s dead, Lenin&#8217;s dead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These were the first two verses of their song, sung to the tune of &#8220;Frere Jacques&#8221;. The song itself was funny, but some Soviet guy who wanted to get in on the action made it even funnier. The guy walked up, and stood next to Greg, peering over his shoulder at the page that contained the lyrics. Then he took Greg&#8217;s hat and put it on. To top it off for a finale, Greg literally hopped in the guys arms. By this point, Toni was virtually in tears from laughing, as were most of us. But Greg did get his hat back.<br />
Then Mr. Phillips made his two presentations to Suzanna and Marina. Suzanna, as I had mentioned, received a book on Canada from all of us. Marina received a bonus, if you will. The average Soviet makes less than 200 rubles in a month. In one minute, Marina received 230. We didn&#8217;t let her refuse either.<br />
That night was a bit on the dull side. As there was no curfew that night, Greg had suggested that we have a Toga party on the beach. It never got any further than a suggestion though. Somehow I doubt that the hotel would have let us. Most of us ended up going to the Heinekin Bar on the C level. I ran into Sonya and Kelly in the elevator on my way down. But we also ran into a little trouble, to the tune of four rather larger German men.<br />
They paid no attention to me but immediately turned to face both Kelly and Sonya. I could feel their nervousness. Either that or I was nervous for them. Had anything come around, there would have been nothing I could have done. As much as I still practice the ancient art of Chivalry (no, it is not dead), I wouldn&#8217;t have lasted ten seconds up against those guys. When the elevator arrived at C level, the three of us got out as fast as we could. The Germans did not follow. A few steps more and we were in the bar. They don&#8217;t card you in the Soviet Union, I doubt they even care.<br />
I was one of a very small number of people (two I think) that drank no alcohol. I was there simply to talk with the others. I did not stay long, I kept getting the distinct feeling that I was not wanted there. I didn&#8217;t want to ruin any friendships that I had then, so to make life a little easier, I left for the Observation Level.<br />
I spent many of my evenings that way, alone. I felt alone for most of the latter half of the trip. I don&#8217;t know why, I just did. Almost like a void. I envied Greg, Derek and Pete for being lucky enough to have relationships during the trip.<br />
Despite the lack of curfew that evening, I turned in at 11:00. There was really no point for me staying awake any longer. Jason had beaten me to sleep again, but I wasn&#8217;t the least bit surprised. What I was surprised at was the fact that no-one stayed up late. Everyone turned in at &#8220;a reasonable hour&#8221;, which means before one in the morning. This I found interesting. For at the beginning of the trip, no-one wanted to go to bed early. Now no-one wanted to stay up late.</p>
<div class="entry">Day 12</div>
<p>Jason made a return from the living dead today, actually showing up for breakfast. I was a bit surprised that he didn&#8217;t get a standing ovation, but then again, just about everyone was deeply engrossed in breakfast, as were the two of us in a short time. Jason set a record eating his meal. If it had been a buffet, the table probably would have been emptied by Jason alone.<br />
Following breakfast, I got down to the serious task of buying souvenirs for not only me, but my family. I had promised them all something and was determined to get something fairly decent. I didn&#8217;t know when I was going to see a BS shop again so I used the one in the hotel. It wasn&#8217;t a bad shop at all, a bit larger than some of the others I had been in. I spent nearly an hour, but I managed to find something for everyone on my list.<br />
I found a pair of earrings for my sister that were had painted china beads on them. I tried to find a decorative plate for my mom, but had to settle for a spoon. My dad got a key chain with a thermometer in it. I know they sound cheap, but the prices were quite high in there. As I collected coins, I also bought a coins set of all the kopecks in circulation. Unfortunately, there wasn&#8217;t much in there that I could afford.<br />
It took me two trips though, the staff there wasn&#8217;t too swift. I then took my newly found treasures back up to our room where I was almost instantly confronted by a short Soviet woman, one of the maids. My towel had fallen off the railing on our balcony a couple days previous and I had to pay for it.<br />
Having gotten rid of her, Jason and I finished with our packing. Then, with great effort, hauled all our shit downstairs, where several of the others were waiting. A few minutes later, the buses (we finally got two of them) were loaded and we were on our way back to the airport. We traveled along the same route we had taken to get to our hotel and the sites were familiar, even though we had only seen them once before.<br />
We didn&#8217;t go directly to the airport, as I had thought we would, but headed along a road that went along the shore of the Black Sea. Here we found a restaurant, were we had lunch. It was a rather peculiar design or a restaurant. It was decked out in a Polynesian design, despite the fact it was in Russia. But the food was Russian, and there was no doubt about that one.<br />
After our filling lunch, we headed back outside and boarded our respective buses, making sure we got on the right one. Then we were on our way to the airport, about ten minutes away. When we arrived, our luggage was taken for us (as it was always) and we went into the terminal. But we didn&#8217;t stay in there long. Less than five minutes later, we were on another bus to take us over to the plane. I guess we were a bit late.<br />
As we were flying almost the width of European Russia, we needed a larger plane. There were also more people going. Because of that, our Aeroflot Ilyushin36 ended up being the long distance kind. It was more or less a cross between a 747 and a DC10. As this was an international plane, it had a higher landing gear. But we still boarded from the runway. Just behind the rear landing gear was a door that folded down from the fuselage to rest on the runway. We entered through the cargo section, climbed a set of permanent stairs to enter right into the cabin, where we took our seats.<br />
I guess our flight was carrying Leningrad children (Soviets often send their children away for the summer) because there were a bunch of them running around. I had a window seat so I didn&#8217;t have to worry about them. Radar on the other hand, a row up or so, spent time trading with them. The three hour flight was fairly uneventful. The flight was smooth (no in-flight meal either) and the landing, unlike a few others, almost flawless.<br />
But, as usual, we did not stop at the terminal. This time, we stopped no where near the terminal. We exited the same way we got on, but instead of following everyone else on the flight to a small glass building, our group hung around until everyone else had grouped together.<br />
Several of us took pictures of our plane. This was a definite no-no in the Soviet Union, and to top it all off, there were two guards nearby watching us. Now either Perestroika was really working or they were just plain lazy.<br />
We then entered the small glass building. The only thing inside was a pair of escalators, one up, one down. It turned out that the building was a hub used to space planes out more. So we went down to the walkway, which was a moving sidewalk. This took us to the main terminal, where we promptly made a quick exit, only to lose half the group again. Greg double backed to find the others while the rest of us waited.<br />
We continued along the outside of the terminal, occasional going inside the terminal and then coming back out, realizing it wasn&#8217;t what we were looking for. We finally found what we were looking for, the area our luggage was going to show up. Just up a staircase was a waiting lobby. There we found a bar where our group pretty well depleted the supply of Pepsi.<br />
We waited there for about an hour until our luggage came out. We collected it and made sure it was all there. But we didn&#8217;t leave yet. First, it was back upstairs to the lobby. Fifteen minutes later, we went into the restaurant adjacent to the lobby for dinner. It was an average dinner for us, including the fish. The food was average, the activities however were not. For starters, Lisa P was feeling a bit kleptomanic, wanting to take a plate, cup, glass and some silverware home with her. But she promised to bring it all back when she visited again (yeah, right!).<br />
Then Kim, Lisa, Jason and Mr. Phillips (everyone at my table except me) broke into verse. To be precise, American Pie. I never liked that song before the trip, since then, it&#8217;s been one of favorites. It was virtually our tour theme. I suppose that if I had gone on that trip two years later, I probably would&#8217;ve joined in, but I was way to insecure about my singing voice.<br />
Not long after, our buses finally showed up. As we were already downstairs, all we did was grab our bags and chose which bus to get on to. It wasn&#8217;t a hard choice. One was the standard bus, the other was a brand spanking new one, not a single colour matching the other. Of course, I grabbed the new one.<br />
We left the airport as we left everything, unceremoniously. We hit the highway and headed for the downtown core. It was a fairly long trip, along the way we saw nuclear power plants (long distance shot too I might add), Lenin shipyards and a few other historical monuments. Out of the skyline, we spotted our hotel. It didn&#8217;t look much different from the one we had in Kiev, but that was from the outside. We hopped off and grabbed our luggage. It wasn&#8217;t raining or anything, but we wanted to check out what we could find of the city while we still had light. We forgot the infamous &#8220;White Nights&#8221; that are typical of the northern region during the summer months.<br />
Then we lined up to try and get our rooms. This was when the next problem cropped up. There were only so many double rooms. The rest were all singles. Jason gave me his passport and I tried to get up as far in the line as possible. However, they ran out of rooms, doubles anyway. I ended up with a single. So taking my key, I made a hasty retreat with my luggage up to my floor. Once again, the elevators were a bit slow. In this hotel, I used the elevator as much as possible, and as far as I know, that&#8217;s all the girls ever used. The stairs were dimly lit and spooky as hell.<br />
Afterwards, almost all of us went out front to trade with the locals. You didn&#8217;t have to go far to get hit by one of them. A veteran trader can pick a tourist out at five hundred metres. Besides, it seemed that the traders had selected this as a common site to trade, there were almost as many traders as there were tourists. Just one tip to anyone who reads this and decides to go to the Soviet Union, take the price tags with you. Shaun tried to trade his $25 Batman shirt, but quickly changed his mind when the Soviets told us it was worth $4.<br />
Pins seem to go nice and cheap. There was this one kid, who couldn&#8217;t have been much older than eight who had a large bag of pins. For a decent sized bag of gum, I got every one of the pins that he had. Call it a hunch, but he was a beginner. Most experienced traders knew a fair bit of English, this kids hardly knew any. In time, he would probably become fairly fluent.<br />
Despite all I had learned of the Soviet&#8217;s great problem of drinking, I was a bit surprised when Mr. Phillips was unable to trade his Canadian scotch. The ironic part was that the guy he was trying to trade with was guzzling a bottle of vodka at the time. While we were working our way around the flock of youthful merchants, we happened to run into a group similar to ourselves. The only major difference was that they were from Alabama. All but one.<br />
He was almost the spokesperson for the group. As he was from Iowa, his accent was almost undetectable to us. All the others had those indicative southern accents. I like to listen to the accent (I don&#8217;t know exactly why), but sometimes I do find it hard to understand, especially if the person has an exceptionally strong accent.<br />
But you must realize, we didn&#8217;t bug them about the accent. As far as we were concerned, we had one too, providing you were looking from their perspective. One of them was warned not to speak despite this insight. It seemed he was from the hills of Alabama and had a very heavy accent. Chances were that this was the kind of accent we would have trouble understanding.<br />
We spent quite some time talking to them, comparing our escapades through the Soviet Union. Regardless of the reports that American students weren&#8217;t doing well academically, we found our American twins to be quite educated, except that they referred to Canada as the 51st state. We corrected them on that one. We probably would have talked to them longer, but they told us they were on their way home. We bid them safe passage and I headed for bed. Sleeping is not easily done in the northern areas on the world during the summer, it almost doesn&#8217;t get dark. Two to three hours of dusk is all you get.<br />
That was the least of my problems that night. I was dying of thirst. Just have a drink of water? Sorry, the water in Leningrad is worse than the water in Mexico. Thanks, but I didn&#8217;t want to get that sick at that point in time. To try and counter my thirst, I brushed my teeth. It worked, not as well as water but I wasn&#8217;t dying of thirst, not completely. But my luck was to improve when I went down to the lobby to sign in for the night.<br />
The Suhs were signing in as I got off the elevator. That&#8217;s when I remembered that they had bought five or six bottles of Pepsi at the airport. I raced over to them, nearly scaring them half to death. Desperate people often do rash things. I almost ended up my knees begging them for mercy. They only had one left, but they were willing to give it up. I promised to buy them two bottles at the BS shop the next day.<br />
Pepsi and AIM toothpaste do not mix well, but at least I wasn&#8217;t thirsty anymore. I owe the Suhs a lot for their generosity. If I hadn&#8217;t gotten anything to drink that night, who knows, I might have died of thirst. Okay, maybe that&#8217;s a bit over doing it, but when you&#8217;re that thirsty, you often tend to exaggerate things just a wee bit.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
We got a brand new Intourist bus &#8230; IT RULED!!! On the way out, I was going to snap off a couple more shots of our Ilyushin 36, but I decided not to. After we got to our hotel (somewhere in Leningrad), most of us went out front and did some heavy duty trading. Something that struck me as odd was the fact that Mr. Phillips couldn&#8217;t unload his good scotch. Very strange indeed.Radar (with some of his shady underworld techniques and my seven bucks) scrounged up a bunch of Hard Rock Cafe t-shirts. At about 10:50, I split for bed, while dying of thirst but I ran into the Suhs (thank God!) and got a bottle of Pepsi off of them (God bless them!!!!) Almost forgot one thing. While we were trading, we met up with a group from Alabama. They were great, not at all like some of the Americans we know, the obnoxious type. Well, g&#8217;night Y&#8217;ALL!.
