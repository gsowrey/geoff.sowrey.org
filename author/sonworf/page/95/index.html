	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While this weekend was absolutely amazing, too many of these and I&#8217;ll die from exhaustion.<br />
I started early Saturday morning. Those of you who are chiming in with &#8220;must be train stuff&#8221; can smile smugly &#8212; &#8216;cuz you&#8217;re right. But it wasn&#8217;t with 6060. This was my first chase since 6060 last year (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]), and this was a lot more challenging. 6060 doesn&#8217;t move very fast &#8212; it can&#8217;t because of the track it runs on. This chase, however, as significantly faster.<br />
The Canadian Pacific Railway is taking their steam locomotive, 2816, out east on the &#8220;Breakfast for Learning&#8221; tour. It&#8217;s the biggest run they&#8217;ve done since the engine was overhauled. From here to Toronto and back, in about 45 days, making a lot of stops between here and Toronto. Saturday was their first leg, from Calgary to Medicine Hat. And I wanted to follow it across the prairies.<br />
I decided I would pick up the train at the old CP Ogden shops (now owned and operated by Alstom). Although the east end of Alyth had a great place to take a picture with a bridge, the light wasn&#8217;t cooperative, and there was no place to park my car. I was the first to show up at my location, but I was soon joined by a few others: the director who was responsible for the locomotive and the train, one of the other members of the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, the parents of one of the train&#8217;s crew, and a guy who had been born and raised in the Ogden area and who&#8217;s father had opened the nearby Ogden Garage in the 1920s.<br />
The train was to leave at 7:00, but started off the day running late, for some reason. When it finally reached us, around 7:20 or so, it looked gorgeous, and running beautifully. It passed by at about 30 km/h &#8212; not very fast. Not yet, anyway. Piling into my car, I gave chase.<br />
I was hoping to catch the train at the east end of the intermodal yard on the east side of the city. But due to a wad of people getting in my way, the train ended up alluding me. Because of the much warmer weather than the last time I chased 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]), there was no steam cloud to see at a distance. All I had to rely on was the fireman every so often putting too much oil in the burner and creating a bit of smoke. I still don&#8217;t have a scanner, which makes following the train&#8217;s progress very difficult.<br />
Passing the intermodal yard, I started onto a gravel road, with two other cars in front of me. I couldn&#8217;t see anything but the dust cloud they kicked up. Finally, we reached a paved road, and I turned south to try and catch up. I reached 22X, and headed east again. I had no idea where the train was, other than it was ahead of me.<br />
The new map I had purchased at the ESSO station actually showed where the railway went, and I still had to go a fair bit south to find the line again. That&#8217;s the problem with chasing trains on the prairies &#8212; the highways rarely follow the tracks. At least on the Laggan sub, I can keep up because there ain&#8217;t a lot of room &#8212; and there the highway *does* follow the railway.<br />
I raced down Highway 24, hoping I&#8217;d be able to catch the train down there. Just as I came over a hill near to where the 24 turns east, I saw the train coming to the crossing. I arrived mere seconds before the train crossed it, but I didn&#8217;t have time to get a picture. The chase was on again!<br />
Further down the road, I stopped in a farmer&#8217;s field east of Carseland to take a picture. As the railway was curving away again, I had to race down more highways to hook back up again. I turned out on to Highway 817 and then onto 901 to continue following. At this point, the train wasn&#8217;t too hard to follow &#8212; the tracks weren&#8217;t too far from the road. The train got held up in Strangmuir for 15 minutes to undergo some greasing, which allowed me to find a comfy little field that sported a small bridge that the train was going to go over. There I found one of CP&#8217;s rail traffic controllers (RTCs), who dispatched the Brooks sub (the line we were both chasing down). He didn&#8217;t go on shift until noon, so had some time to chase.<br />
I caught the train again where the tracks cross the 901, along with a few others including an A-Channel truck. Then to Gleichen, where I met a rather racist CP police officer, snapped a photo, and ran off to Cluny. There, I met up with the RTC again. He suggested Bassano as the next decent stop, so off we went. This time, I followed him, and it was good that I did. He led me right to the best spot to get a picture. Pretty much where everyone else chasing the train was: an old CP railway station and a rather large yard.<br />
There I met a couple of far more professional photographers who suggested my next venue: the Brooks Aqueduct. Once the train had left, we were off. Brooks is about 180 kilometres southeast of Calgary, heading towards Medicine Hat. Brooks is pretty much the last stop before you enter the vast, barren plains of the southern prairies. There ain&#8217;t much in Brooks, which really surprised me when I saw on my map a marker for &#8220;Brooks Aqueduct National Historic Site&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find. All you have to do is find the sign on the highway, and drive south until you see a huge concrete aqueduct, like a modern version of a Roman aqueduct.<br />
But modern it isn&#8217;t. I parked in the interpretive centre&#8217;s lot, and was immediately met by Lee, one of the two interpreters at the site. She was a little puzzled by why I was there &#8212; though most of their visitors come from Calgary. I explained that I was chasing a train. Yes, I did get a rather strange look. She recommended that I walk down the aqueduct canal to the siphon, which was apparently the best place to see trains in the area. Thanking her for the advice, and promising to come back, I went off in search of my quarry.<br />
The canal is a huge earthen trench built up on the floor of the shallow valley that Brooks sits in. Barely 100 metres to the north of the canal is the old aqueduct, no longer in service. (More on it in a moment.) I walked until the canal &#8220;ended&#8221; at the railway &#8212; where an inverse siphon runs under the railroad and re-enters the canal on the other side. The siphon works on the venturi principle &#8212; basically, what goes in has gotta come out.<br />
I was well ahead of the train, which gave me a lot of time to wander around and find the best place to take a picture. By the time I&#8217;d found the ideal place, three more photographers showed up, including the guys who&#8217;d told me about the place. We took our positions and waited.<br />
Soon, the light appeared in the distance, and the train raced towards us. Though not going at full speed, it didn&#8217;t take long to pass. I have to completely agree with Lee and the photographers &#8212; the aqueduct was the best place to see this train.<br />
I returned to the interpretive centre, where Lee came out to meet me. I asked her for her perspective on the aqueduct. (I told you I was getting back to this.) Back in the early 1900s, CP was in the colonizing business. There was a lot of money to be made in bringing people to the west. Especially if you&#8217;d bought all the land around the railway tracks when you built them, and sold it off to the immigrants who paid you to come west. However, not all parts of the west were ideal for farming &#8212; some are quite dry.<br />
Such is the case with the area east of Brooks. No significant rivers, no lakes, and little rainfall poses a lot of problems. To make the area saleable, CP had to provide water for irrigation. This lead to the need to dam the Bow River at Bassano, then move the water through canals to the east. At Brooks, the land forms into a shallow valley that created a problem &#8212; without massive (and expensive) pumps, there was no way to get the water to the east. CP&#8217;s engineering department came up with the solution: the Brooks Aqueduct.<br />
At 3.2 kilometres long, and upwards of 90 feet tall, it was the largest aqueduct in the world at the time. It pushed all the boundaries of construction knowledge, which also led to problems. Most revolutions don&#8217;t go off very well the first time. The alkaline water dissolved the concrete, the lead expansion joints leaked constantly, the spars across the top of the sluice caused backflow, and the 0.01% grade kept the water moving so slowly that silt, plants, and even fish slowed the water flow. The aqueduct only ever reached 2/3 of its planned capacity. After an extensive and expensive overhaul in the 1930s, the aqueduct was turned over to the local farming collective.<br />
By the 1970s, the aqueduct was costing too much to repair. The local governments decided to replace it with an earthen canal that provided more water than the aqueduct ever could have (even if it had reached full capacity), and doesn&#8217;t leak. The old aqueduct was made a National Historic Site in the 1980s.<br />
I drove down the length of the aqueduct to get a good look at it. Well, as much as I could. Once decommissioned, the aqueduct no longer received maintenance. To prevent injury, a fence runs around the perimeter. A gap in the fence did allow me to sneak in for a couple of pictures from underneath. The western end, completely cut off from the original water supply, is now home to the local party hangout, identified from the graffiti, countless broken beer bottles, and the still-smouldering remnants of a fire. The view down the aqueduct is something else.<br />
It was about then that I noticed the time: 12:45. I needed to be back in Calgary for a party at 14:00. I was going to be late.<br />
I pulled into the car wash at 16th Ave. and Edmonton Trail just before 15:00. The car had turned a brownish green (from all the dust), with multicoloured speckling (from all the bugs). It was shiny in only a few minutes. Then it was my turn to get clean.<br />
I arrived at Shantie&#8217;s house just before 16:00. This was a soccer party, and as near as I could figure, I was one of the only non-soccer people invited. Needless to say, I wasn&#8217;t too keen to leap right into the game. Mostly because I haven&#8217;t played since high school, and even then I was terrible. I resolved to sit in the weak shade of a tree (not all the trees here have sprouted leaves yet) and take pictures. The six-year old daughter of one of the guests noticed it right away and asked if she could use it. It&#8217;s a durable little thing, and I figured &#8212; could get some interesting pictures.<br />
The girl, Shayla, took almost 150 pictures over the next few hours.<br />
The game ended around 17:00 and we retreated to Shantie&#8217;s house (across the street from the soccer field) to engage in conversation and food. John (one of the other guests) tried to engage in a battle of wits with Shayla. The six year old won, hands down. It was just the beginning.<br />
Shantie has some really great friends. They&#8217;re hilarious to hang around with, and are in no way exclusionary. They even knew when to pick on me because I brought veggie burgers. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone vegan &#8212; but I&#8217;ve had these sitting in my freezer for a year, and I gotta eat &#8217;em.)<br />
I ended up talking with Lindsay for over an hour about Japan. (She&#8217;d been there in high school.) We talked until it was just too cool to be away from the fire pit everyone else had gathered around. (I should note that it was gorgeously warm, and it was just a slightly cool breeze that was making it uncomfortable. Besides, we were feeling left out.)<br />
By midnight, everyone had left, including myself. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, was harbouring a half-dozen sunburns, and needed some serious sleep.<br />
Today was the Lilac Festival in Calgary. I didn&#8217;t go to it this year, as I felt I had more pressing things to take care of: namely the small army of dandelions that were laying siege to my front lawn. Screwdriver in hand, I went to eradicate the little buggers from my grass.<br />
Most people use chemicals when they get rid of weeds. I&#8217;m not a big fan of chemicals in the yard, not even fertilizers. I prefer the natural, brute force methods. I even use an unpowered push mower to cut my grass. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard work, but you feel better for it. Especially when total strangers thank you for not using chemicals.<br />
While there was still a lot of afternoon left, I went for a walk along the river, taking in the sights and sounds of the World Walk, or something like that, taking place at Prince&#8217;s Island Park. I didn&#8217;t spend long, so I don&#8217;t really know what it was all about. I had a mission: I needed to get my bike.<br />
People were everywhere. Calgary becomes very active when it gets warm. When there&#8217;s a festival on, you almost have problems moving at times. Along all the major strips, the patios are open and full. Everyone is enjoying the outdoors again. Summer is definitely here.<br />
Now if it would just rain so we could all cool off&#8230;</p>

		<p>When I finally arrived home from my stint with the CBC so many months ago (see [[Home for a rest]]), I was happy to be back. It will be nice to be home after my trip to Japan, even though it&#8217;s sad to leave it so soon.<br />
When I arrived almost two weeks ago, I had no idea what to expect. There were a lot of questions, intrepidation, excitement, and desire. The fear would not last long, and I certainly got a healthy dose of adventure. But there is simply too much to see and do in Japan &#8212; you could visit for a year and before you could see enough to be satisfied.<br />

		<p>Another day, another adventure. Today, though, we would throw in a different nationality.<br />
We all rose at basically the same time and quickly prepared for our departure. We needed to be in Yokohama by about 10:30, which meant we had to leave fairly early. It&#8217;s just shy of two hours to Yokohama.<br />

Chris was up early to meet Kaz at Tokyo station. We had loosely planned to hit something interesting in Tokyo today, but Ellesen and I needed to sleep in a bit. (Where Chris finds all the energy he&#8217;s got lately, I&#8217;ll never understand.)<br />

		<p>I think a good rule of thumb for how long you should stay in one place while on vacation is your comfort level. When you become too comfortable, you&#8217;ve stayed too long. I&#8217;ve become very comfortable with Tokyo.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say I&#8217;m bored with Tokyo &#8212; far from it. This city &#8212; this country, in fact &#8212; has so much to offer that it is seriously impossible to cover all of it in a mere two weeks. I could spend almost two weeks in Tokyo alone! I wish I didn&#8217;t have to go home right away, so I could spend more time seeing the country. Four days remain.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After a few days of non-stop touring, a slow day is much appreciated, even though it wasn&#8217;t planned that way.<br />
Chris was up before me, starting to clean up the apartment. It wasn&#8217;t messy by any means, but today we&#8217;re expecting the arrival of Ellesen, one of Chris&#8217; friends from university and from film school. Supposedly, we&#8217;re going to have five people here on Sunday night, so there&#8217;s going to be a big effort to have enough room for all of us to sleep.<br />
Chris also needed to finish up some work for his school &#8212; a flyer that will encourage people to come and take classes. Then we had to meet up with Naome in Chiba to pass off the disc with the design. All of this, and we planned to hit the National Museum of Japanese History.<br />
By the time we left the house, it was 13:30. Based on instructions, we were to meet in front of the Starbucks in the Corridor Mall next to the Chiba JR Station. Problem: Just like in North America, there is the possibility for more than one Starbucks in the same mall. We stood in front of the one we thought was the only one for about 20 minutes before we got a hold of Naome, who was in front of a different Starbucks.<br />
While we were waiting, we saw another great example of Japanese order. A bicycle was parked next to the Starbucks entrance, but inside the mall. (The mall has no outer doors, so it&#8217;s possible to cycle right through it without getting off.) Parking the bike there was a no-no, and the police officer who found it wasn&#8217;t too happy about it. After checking that it wasn&#8217;t ours, he wrote a ticket.<br />
Now, here&#8217;s the question: How do you write a ticket for a misplaced bicycle? You don&#8217;t attach it to the bike. You attach it to the wall where the bike was, and then impound the bike.<br />
We finally met up with Naome and handed off the disk. While there, we met Ken, a New Zealander also teaching with Chris&#8217; company. Then it was off onto the Keisei line (a privately-owned line separate from the JR lines) to try and get to Sakura, location of the museum.<br />
The Seikei line is a local line, and makes a lot of stops. In fact, it made so many stops that we felt there wouldn&#8217;t be enough time to see the museum before we&#8217;d have to be back in Yotsukaido to meet Ellison when her train arrived sometime after 17:00.<br />
At the stop before Tsudanuma, we abandoned the quest for the museum. Instead, we decided to try for the temple in Narita. We switched to the JR line and headed for Narita. It&#8217;s a fairly long trip. Although only three stops after Yotsukaido, the gaps between the stops become significantly longer.<br />
Narita is the airport town. The airport itself is a fair distance away, but this is the first major stop from the airport. Hence, it&#8217;s very international. It&#8217;s probably the most western city in this part of Japan, after Tokyo. It&#8217;s also possibly the most stereotypically-looking Japanese city I&#8217;ve visited. Part of it sits on a hill, has the winding streets with high buildings on either side, with narrow little alleys. The area from the JR station to the temple is quaint and picturesque.<br />
The Daihonzan Naritasan Shinshoji Temple complex is immense, covering many acres of land. It&#8217;s founding is also very old, started in the (western) year 940. The founding monk is entombed on the property.<br />
After going through the gates, you cross over a small bridge over a small pond. On the other side is a fairly steep staircase going up the side of the hill. On the hill are many statues and stone markers. Whether they are graves of previous monks, I don&#8217;t know &#8212; the complex isn&#8217;t littered with explanation signs in English. (I do have to say, though, that with a bit of planning, this place could very easily became a UNESCO site &#8230; that is, assuming it already isn&#8217;t.)<br />
At the top of the staircase is the shrine. It&#8217;s a huge Buddhist-style building. In front is the ever-present incense burner, and to the right is a fairly large pagoda. Unfortunately, by the time we got there, the altar had closed for the day. Protected behind a sheet of glass, I couldn&#8217;t even take a picture of it (because of the glare).<br />
We walked around the surrounding area a bit before realizing there was a terrace above the shrine. Up there were important cultural properties, including a votive hall, the tomb of the founding monk, and a couple of other buildings. Over the trees, the top of another pagoda &#8212; one with a golden spire &#8212; was clearly visible. This is the one we could see from the JR station.<br />
The one is huge. It&#8217;s 53.1 metres tall. It&#8217;s such a beautiful building &#8212; perfect symmetry, vibrant colours, the sparkle of reverence. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s for something important, but I don&#8217;t know what.<br />
It was already just after 17:00, just when Ellesen&#8217;s train was due to arrive in Tokyo (she was coming from Morioka in northern Japan, on a Shinkansen). She still had to change trains and come to Yotsukaido, but we needed to head back and meet her at the station.<br />
After a bit of a wait at the Narita station, we caught a very bumpy ride back home. Along the way, we saw a beautiful sunset. Sort of ironic, seeing as Japan is supposed to be the Land of the Rising Sun.<br />
We were earlier than Ellesen&#8217;s train &#8212; she was still in Chiba awaiting the next train to Yotsukaido. This gave us enough time to quickly hit the video arcade.<br />
Meeting up with Ellesen, we headed back to the apartment to unload our bags. After a quick trip to the gas station to get more kerosene for Chris&#8217; space heater, we headed back to the JR station, and into Chiba, where we met up with Naome and went for dinner.<br />
I&#8217;m kind of beginning to feel like a local. The trips are becoming commonplace, and even the restaurant we went to was the same as the one Chris and I went to two nights ago (see [[My Trip to Japan, Shinkansen to Mount Fuji]]).<br />
Returning home a couple of hours later, Ellesen, Chris, and I talked well into the night. Well, they talked &#8212; I fell asleep. Even the assistance of caffeine from a small bottle of Coke didn&#8217;t help.<br />
There are no set plans for tomorrow. &#8220;Tokyo&#8221; is the only word.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Japanese have borrowed many concepts of rail management from North America. For instance, you will generally see words like &#8220;rapid&#8221; or &#8220;limited express&#8221; when you see train listings. And you&#8217;ll see them written in English as well as in Japanese.<br />
But Japanese trains are far more efficient and run on very tight schedules. Unlike North America, you can time your watch to the trains here. If you think you might be a minute late for your train, you&#8217;re going to miss it. That&#8217;s how we missed the express train this morning &#8212; we resigned ourselves to having missed it. Probably for the best, too &#8212; it looked full.<br />
Arriving in Tokyo, we headed from the JR train to the Maranouchi subway line. A couple of stops, and we changed to the Hibiya line. This would take us to within a short walking distance of the Tsukiji Fish Market.<br />
What the heck were we doing at a fish market? This ain&#8217;t just any ordinary market&#8230;<br />
Imagine a place where every single aquatic foodstuff for an entire country is bought and sold in mass quantities on a near-daily basis. Something so massively huge that it sucks up several city blocks. This is the Tsukiji Fish Market.<br />
I&#8217;m not sure whether or not every single fish consumed in Japan comes through here, but it sure as heck looks that way. The traffic going through the complex is mind-boggling. Although the market&#8217;s day begins somewhere around 02:00 in the morning and finishes by 14:00 in the afternoon, the traffic at 10:30 is still a blur. The last of the larger trucks arrive to pick up thousands upon thousands of Styrofoam packing crates with fish &#8212; alive and frozen (or =-otherwise chilled) &#8212; and whisk them off to parts unknown. Hundreds of small gasoline powered carts whiz around seemingly without care for pedestrians. And there is always the constant drone of motor scooters and delivery bikes.<br />
The market itself is open to the public &#8212; anyone can go walking inside, and you can buy direct from the wholesalers. Just be forewarned that you should go in with a pair of rubber boots. The floors are all wet, and the vendors don&#8217;t think twice about emptying the water from containers right onto the floor &#8212; and they don&#8217;t look before they tip.<br />
Now you&#8217;d think that the smell in this place would be overpowering &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing quite like the stench of rotting fish. There is no smell at Tsukiji &#8212; that&#8217;s how fresh the fish is. Nothing ever gets the chance to go bad.<br />
By the time Chris and I arrived, there was not as much fish as there had likely been earlier in the day. The tuna auction, usually held at 05:00, was long over and most of the large trucks had carted the fish away. We found only two hamachi (yellow-tail) tuna remaining.<br />
Think of any fish. Actually, pretty much anything that lives in the water and would be consumed in reasonably large quantities. Chances are, it&#8217;s in there somewhere. Squid, cuttlefish, red snapper, orange roughie, conch, abalone, scallops &#8212; they&#8217;re all part of the seafood currency the market deals with every day. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why seafood in Japan is so good.<br />
To find out how good, Chris and I decided to partake of one of the nearby sushi bars to find out what uber-fresh sushi was like. We didn&#8217;t walk into the first place we saw, though &#8212; we ended up flipping a coin to choose.<br />
The place was small, having barely 15 seats. At peak, the restaurant is probably packed with patrons from the fish wholesale industry. By the time we got there, it was nigh-empty &#8212; only one person. Chris and I took our seats, and began to figure out what we were going to eat.<br />
Chris engaged in a conversation with the chefs, who suggested a set. Deciding it sounded like a good idea, we sat down to watch our meal being prepared. It was served in a wet banana leaf, with a heaping of pickled ginger, a large cup of fresh green tea, and a bowl of miso soup with fish.<br />
The experience was amazing. Chris carried on a competent conversation with the staff, telling them about some of our experiences (including our somewhat-failed attempt to see Mount Fuji yesterday). We were rewarded (I think) with hand-rolls for our troubles.<br />
We were not full, but satiated when it was time for us to leave. It was raining, so a quick departure wasn&#8217;t possible. A quick stop to one of the stalls in the area provided two umbrellas. (A note to anyone who gets caught in the rain at Tsukiji &#8212; don&#8217;t buy an umbrella there. Sprint a block away to the Outer Market and buy one there at half-price.)<br />
We headed down the road Outer Market and perused the stalls. (Apparently, there&#8217;s a great 24 hour sushi restaurant in there somewhere.) Then it was towards the subway station we&#8217;d arrived at. But not before one little distraction&#8230;<br />
Right next to the subway station is a Buddhist temple &#8212; the Tsukiji Hongwanji Temple. This particular temple was built in 1931, after the previous one was destroyed in an earthquake in 1923. (The first temple was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1657.)<br />
Returning to the station, we boarded the Yamanote line again, this time for the Hamamatsucho station. This is where you&#8217;ll find Tokyo&#8217;s main bus terminal, which is where we would take our bus tour of Tokyo.<br />
Being a little early, Chris and I did a little exploring. We found our way to the Observatory atop Tokyo&#8217;s World Trade Center (not to be confused with the late WTC in New York). From here, we were provided excellent views of the greater downtown Tokyo area. Or rather, we would have been, had the weather been a bit better. But we did pretty well, all things considered.<br />
After circling the Observatory, we returned to the bus terminal to await the start of our tour. The first part of the tour wasn&#8217;t actually on a bus. Our guide, Yoshi, took us on the first part of the trip &#8230; to the Observatory in the World Trade Center.<br />
Chris and I just laughed at the coincidence. The staff in the Observatory smiled when they saw us again.<br />
The trip back up wasn&#8217;t a total washout &#8212; Yoshi did tell us more information about Tokyo than we knew when we were last up there.<br />
One interesting fact that kept coming up was how much Tokyo had once been controlled by Shogun. In the days before Imperial control of all of Japan, large portions of the country &#8212; especially the eastern portion &#8212; was ruled by shogun, not the emperor. Back then, Edo (now Tokyo) was ruled by powerful shogun.<br />
When Matthew Perry arrived in Japan and arranged to allow American ships to dock in Tokyo harbour in the 1860&#8217;s, the shogun had no choice but to accept the &#8220;offer&#8221; of the more powerful American naval vessels. Soon, the Europeans were doing the same thing, and the shogun appeared almost powerless. The samurai voted to overthrow the shogun, and install the Emperor in his place. To facilitate the change, the Emperor moved from Kyoto in 1867 to Edo, and renamed it &#8220;Eastern Capital&#8221;, or Tokyo.<br />
Many of the original buildings from the shogun era still exist, including a shrine at the foot of Tokyo Tower, the Zojoji Temple, the Hama-rikyu Garden (a former hunting ground for the shogun) and the Imperial Palace complex (appropriated by the Emperor in 1867).<br />
The bus tour began once we got back downstairs. Our first stop was at the main gate of the Imperial Palace.<br />
The Imperial Palace grounds are immense, but not as large as they used to be. Today, the outer moat is gone, though one still exists on the outside of the main wall. The main wall has been divided to allow traffic through the palace grounds, though one road is blocked for use only by the Emperor.<br />
The Palace is closed to the public except for two days a year &#8212; 2 January and 23 December. Otherwise, you can only see the Palace from the outside. But even those glimpses are of a world far older than anything North America has to offer, and of a culture in ways alien to my own,<br />
After snapping a large number of pictures, we headed off to our second stop at Asakusa Kannon Temple. The route from the Imperial Palace to the temple would also take us through the Ginza district and also the Akeharbara district.<br />
According to legend, the temple dates back to the (western) year 628, when two fishermen found a statue of Kannon in the river. (Kannon is an image of Buddha.) The statue became the central point for the monastery, which was built around the original shrine over the next 1,000 years. Today, the statue is said to still exist, though it is well-hidden. Not even the monks see the statue. A previous emperor is said to have sent four people to prove that the statue still exists (the Emperor himself did not come).<br />
As our guide then tells the story, the four people then died. (Of course, she didn&#8217;t say when&#8230;)<br />
The Asakusa Kannon Temple is a little strange. It&#8217;s still active, but has been blended with a strange commercialism. Leading up to the temple from the road is the Nakamise Shopping Street. It exists with the boundaries of the temple grounds, and basically forms an alleyway leading up to the temple. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any direct connection with the temple itself, but I suspect there&#8217;s some sort of mutual benefit.<br />
The temple it quite an interesting place. Although protected for tourists (or for pigeons, I&#8217;m not sure which), it still retains its mystical qualities. If you&#8217;ve been to a Buddhist temple before, you&#8217;ll know what I mean. If you haven&#8217;t, you should visit one.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t stay long, as we had to rush to get on our boat for the cruise down the Sumida River.<br />
The cruise isn&#8217;t particularly riveting, but it does offer an interesting point of view. We cruised along for about 45 minutes, passing buildings and under bridges, before entering the edges of Tokyo Bay and ending at the cruise ship dock. It was back on the bus, back to the station, and then back on the trains to Chiba.<br />
After running an errand, we ate at Skylark, possibly the most western-like restaurant I&#8217;ve eaten at since arriving in Japan. But even at a western-like restaurant, you can find purely Japanese food. Even mushrooms I actually like.<br />
It&#8217;s been a long day. Tomorrow we&#8217;re playing it light &#8212; just a visit to the Natural History Museum.<br />
Which probably means a much shorter entry&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We woke up relatively early this morning. For anyone on vacation, that&#8217;s before noon. For us, it was around 09:00. The goal today was Mount Fuji, about an hour south of Tokyo.<br />
An hour by bullet, that is.<br />
Following the usual rise-and-go routine of the morning (shower, shave, etc.), we made a run to the 7-11 before heading to the train. I know it sounds really strange to say we&#8217;re going to a 7-11, even when I&#8217;m in very urban (almost rural) Japan. One thing you&#8217;ll find there is there are a lot of American chain stores and restaurants: Starbucks, AM PM, Lawson&#8217;s (which I hadn&#8217;t heard of before coming here), Subway, the ubiquitous McDonald&#8217;s, 7-11, Red Lobster, and even Denny&#8217;s.<br />
In most cases, though, the store/restaurant is very different than in North America. For example, you won&#8217;t find pretty much any North American food in a 7-11 &#8212; it&#8217;s all Japanese food, although along similar lines that you&#8217;d find in a North American 7-11. (And beer. You don&#8217;t get that in Canada.) One of the neat things are these little triangular rice cakes wrapped in nori (seaweed), usually with some sort of extra flavouring, like salmon, pork, and so forth. They&#8217;re amazing for breakfast.<br />
The really cool thing about these triangles is in how they&#8217;re packaged. The seaweed needs to be kept dry, while the rice needs to stay moist. This is done by using the most elaborately-arranged plastic wrapping that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Once you see how it works, it&#8217;s truly elegant, though it is a little confusing at first.<br />
Upon arriving in Tokyo, we made our way to the Shinkansen area. The Shinkansen are the legendary Japanese &#8220;bullet&#8221; trains. They run at extremely high speeds (about 250 km/h), and are extremely convenient when getting between cities that are close enough not to fly, but far enough that driving is just inconvenient. (Of course, if you don&#8217;t have a car, then the train is all the better.) They&#8217;re not the fastest trains in the world (that record is held by France&#8217;s TGV), but they&#8217;re no slouches, either.<br />
The Kodomo Superexpress runs from Tokyo terminal to Shi-Osaka, making about 10 stops along the way. The distance is quite far &#8212; probably about 400 kilometres or more. (That&#8217;s a guess, as I have no maps or figures.) It&#8217;ll do the trip in about two hours, including the station stops.<br />
The Shinkansen lines are separate from the other rail lines used for regular commuter trains. The slower-speed trains use jointed rail (lengths of rail linked together with plates). This is fine for slow-speed travel, but not for high-speed passenger travel. The gaps between the rail lengths would cause shuddering in the train as it slammed across them. The rails would deform and the wheels of the train would be damaged. So much more expensive (and labour-intensive) continuous welded rail must be used instead.<br />
The Shinkansen itself is like an airplane. The seats are built roughly the same way, but are a little lower (assumedly for the smaller stature of the average Japanese person) and have no seat belts. The train runs so smoothly that you have no need for one.<br />
The train pulled out of the station at about 12:15. It accelerated to about 100 km/h within a very short distance of the station, but didn&#8217;t go much faster until we were outside Tokyo city limits. This wasn&#8217;t because of safety &#8212; this was because the tracks had to follow a very curvy path before being allowed to run straight. Shinkansen, like any high-speed train, prefers straightaways over curves.<br />
You can&#8217;t really feel the acceleration of the train, like you would an airplane taking off, but you do notice the change in speed. I&#8217;ve heard from several people who have ridden the TGV that the movement is noticeable, but only if you&#8217;re paying attention. Otherwise, the motion is almost magical.<br />
Soon, the countryside was whipping by at speeds that would make my eyes hurt if I tried to follow something that was fairly close to the train. The city quickly gave way to smaller towns and villages. Farms, old houses, small factories, rivers &#8230; the rural life passed us by faster than the time most rural folk give thought to the trappings of city life.<br />
The plains of the coast gave way to mountains, and the train started darting in and out of mountains. I think there are more tunnels on the Kodomo line than there are in the entire Canadian Pacific Railway system. High speed trains don&#8217;t go over or around mountains &#8212; they go through them. And sometimes so fast and frequently, you can actually start to feel your ears pop from the constant pressure change.<br />
Just outside of Mishumi, we caught our first glance of our quarry &#8212; Mount Fuji, off the in the distance. It wasn&#8217;t quite what I expected. The &#8220;traditional&#8221; crown of white snow was little more than stripes, assumedly from the spring melts. I can only assume the white cap is only in winter. I snapped pictures from the train as we passed through.<br />
We had been told by many people that the place to see the mountain was in Shizuoka. We stayed on the train until we got to the stop. According to maps and photos, we could go a short distance and obtain some very nice photos. However, there was a minor problem &#8230; we couldn&#8217;t see the mountain.<br />
Chris enquired, and we were told that we were better off going back one stop on the local Tokaido line to obtain a better picture. Hopping on the local train, we found the situation not any better. Apparently, we had run into Fuji&#8217;s most famous problem. According to Chris&#8217; friend Shinichiro, Mount Fuji is very shy. We had just found out how shy it was.<br />
We returned to Shizuoka, and took the next Shinkansen to Shin-Fuji, which apparently was the best place to see the mountain when the weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating. By the time we arrived in Shin-Fuji, clouds had almost entirely obscured the mountain. Living near mountains myself, I know how volatile the weather can be. Figuring it wasn&#8217;t quite worth leaving just yet, Chris and I decided to grab a bite to eat and hope the weather clears.<br />
Not wanting to stay at the station, we went in search of a restaurant. An initial look around the station wasn&#8217;t terribly promising. So Chris enquired about the location of downtown Shin-Fuji from some bus drivers. They laughed incredulously.<br />
&#8220;Downtown?&#8221; they cried, &#8220;There&#8217;s no downtown here!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What do you do for fun?&#8221; Chris asked.<br />
&#8220;Go to Tokyo.&#8221;<br />
Not wanting to take that for a literal answer, we decided to find out what Shin-Fuji was all about. Heading south of the station, we found our way to the corner of the major street near the station and what appeared to be a local highway. We followed it for a couple of kilometres before deciding to turn north and wander through a neighbourhood to see what we could find.<br />
Not much.<br />
It seems that the bus drivers hadn&#8217;t been kidding &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a heck of a lot of anything in Shin-Fuji. All we found were varying states of nothing. All we got were stunned looks from some of the locals. I mean, what were a pair of gaijin (one a tattooed black man) doing wandering through a neighbourhood like theirs? Had they become lost from the train?<br />
We ended up back at the station, completely empty-handed, and hungry. North of the station wasn&#8217;t any better, although we didn&#8217;t walk even remotely as far before giving up. Instead, we caught the next eastbound Shinkansen to Tokyo. The trains&#8217; gently motion soon put me to sleep.<br />
We got off in Chiba, rather than continue all the way to Yotsukaido. Chris wanted to pick up a gift for Kaz, and we would get something to eat before heading home for the night. After our stop at Yodobashi Camera, we hit a restaurant that features izakawa-style food, which is basically the Japanese version of pub food (though much better prepared and probably a lot better for you, too).<br />
So far, I&#8217;ve had several varieties of Japanese food, and I like them all. Even the dreaded natto. The best part is that almost all of it is very good for you, too. Japanese cuisine, even the stuff that&#8217;s considered &#8220;fast&#8221;, is so much healthier than North American food. I can only guess how much weight I could lose here from eating better. I only wish such foods were readily available in Canada.<br />
It&#8217;s an odd thing, really. The Japanese have some of the best diets in the world, but simultaneously are some of the heaviest smokers I&#8217;ve seen in years. The dichotomy of healthy/unhealthy habits is quite astonishing.<br />
We were back in Yotsukaido before 22:00 &#8212; Chris has some design work to do, and having an early evening for a change sounded good.<br />
Besides, it gave me a good excuse to hit the 7-11 for dessert. A couple snacks, a bottle of Fanta Fruit Punch, and we were back to rest and relax for an evening. Tomorrow, the tour of Tokyo!<br />
Oh, and Haagen-Dasz makes a killer green tea ice cream.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was a bit of a late start for us. Not for any particular reason, we just slept in a little bit.<br />
Today was Tokyo day. Sure, we&#8217;d been to Tokyo before for clubbing (see [[My Trip to Japan, Tokyo and Shibuya|yesterday]]), but I didn&#8217;t really see much of Tokyo. It&#8217;s hard to get a good idea of a place when you don&#8217;t actually see it.<br />
We boarded the train just after noon and headed into Chiba, where we switched from the local to the train to Tokyo. The ride in was much more interesting than the last one &#8212; I could actually see where we were going. It was more interesting than on the highway, since the highway is mostly blocked off with sound barriers.<br />
Arriving at Tokyo station, we wound our way up to the Yamanote line, which runs in a circle around the city. This would take us to our first location of the day &#8212; Akehabara. If you&#8217;ve never heard of the place, you might have heard of a place in Tokyo where you can find almost anything electronic. This is that place.<br />
The moment we exited the station, we were confronted with a huge wall of bright signs, neon lights, and blasting sounds of electronics for sale. It was time to see what really interesting things I could find.<br />
We went into the first store along our path. Six stories of geek heaven. Digital cameras, video cameras, computers, televisions, stereo systems, Minidiscs &#8212; you name it. It was all there. All for the taking, if the price is right&#8230;<br />
Which of course begs the question &#8212; is the price worth it? Well, that all depends on what you&#8217;re looking for. If you want something unique, hard-to-find, or so cutting edge it&#8217;s not available in North America, then you&#8217;re in luck. Otherwise, there&#8217;s not really a lot of benefit &#8212; you&#8217;re probably better off getting it where you are.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything in particular &#8212; a new digital camera might be nice, as would a Minidisc player, but the only thing I really had an interest in was a mini stereo system for my kitchen. I&#8217;ve been searching high and low for one that meets my rather meagre needs: multiple discs and detachable speakers that aren&#8217;t hard-wired. Over a year of searching in Canada had resulted in nothing. But here in Tokyo, I figured I had a chance.<br />
The first mini system I saw had exactly what I wanted. For about $500. Interesting thing, though: it was only one of two such systems I saw al day. Through a dozen different stores, I only saw one other system that fit the bill. Eight thousand kilometres, and only two systems.<br />
The biggest irony? Not much different than I could have got at home.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop us from hitting store after store, seeing what we could find. Lots of neat stuff, but none of it that we really needed. (Note that I&#8217;m not saying &#8220;wanted&#8221; &#8212; you can always want something.)<br />
After about two hours, we gave up on Akehabara, and wandered out into the city to see what else was around. We passed by the transportation museum, and decided it was time to find out what was down the next alley.<br />
Tokyo is littered with small roads (that would be classified as alleyways in most North American cities), each one different from the next, barely unidentifiable, and almost always unmarked (or so it seems). But they are always fascinating.<br />
We stopped for an early dinner, some time around 17:30. We popped into a ramen shop for some noodles. The shop worked a little differently than others I&#8217;ve seen. Here, you put coins in a machine, which dispensed a ticket. You turned the ticket over to the cooks, who then made your order. My order, purely by my own lack of knowledge of ramen intricacies, was actually cold. Although not exactly what I was looking for, it was still very good.<br />
We kept walking after our meal, turning at random streets and seeing where they went. Without really knowing where we were, we soon appeared in front of the Tokyo train station &#8212; more or less where we wanted to be anyway.<br />
The Tokyo train station is old &#8212; built with western stylings, I can only guess it was build in the 1920s. It certainly predates World War II. From the outside, it doesn&#8217;t really look that big. But it goes a long way underground, and covers a lot of area above ground. The first time I arrived at the station, I had no idea where I was going. Now, I might be able to figure out where I&#8217;m going. Maybe.<br />
Back to the Yamanote line, we headed in the opposite direction, this time heading to Shibuya. I wanted to see one of the most famous districts in Tokyo.<br />
Shibuya is one of about three fashion districts in Tokyo. Like every other district in Tokyo, Shibuya has its distinctive denizens and a unique style from other areas. It&#8217;s a little grittier than other parts of Tokyo (at least the ones I&#8217;ve seen so far), but it&#8217;s still nice compared to similar areas of virtually every North American city.<br />
We started at the intersection at the Shibuya station &#8212; one of the most famous in the world. It&#8217;s the one that always seems to be shown when the subject involves Tokyo nightlife. The number of people at this intersection alone is incredible. It makes New York City look deserted.<br />
And so we wandered. I know I&#8217;ve used that word a lot, but it&#8217;s the most appropriate considering how we explored the neighbourhood. Up one road, hit a fork, go down another road. Most of the time, this would lead us into another interesting place we hadn&#8217;t seen.<br />
But it also sometimes led us into shadier areas. One road in particular was littered with strip clubs and love hotels. A &#8220;love hotel&#8221; is pretty much what you&#8217;re currently thinking it is &#8212; a place where a couple can go to be with each other in private. Most people in this country stay at home until their mid-to-late 20s.<br />
After a while, we ended up in front of the HMV. While a store I can find in Canada, I wanted to see if I could find some of the albums I was asked to hunt down while here. Besides, listening to music is still a favoured past-time.<br />
We found one of the albums, Chris piping in that he had copies of some of the albums my friend is looking for. I&#8217;ll have to check in with my friend to see if that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s looking for. I&#8217;m in town for a while yet to come, so I&#8217;ll have time to figure this all out.<br />
Coming out of HMV, we went in search of something else to do. It ended up being a near-half hour search for something to eat, mostly so my poor feet could get a bit of a break. All that standing and walking around had reduced my feet to some serious pain.<br />
We ended up at a yakatori restaurant, which is basically grilled foods on a stick. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, I know, but believe me &#8212; it was really tasty. And not being very large, it was just was I needed before we headed off on our next adventure.<br />
Which ended up being getting our butts back to the train as fast as possible so we could get home. We got all the way to Chiba before the trains went out of service. We ended up having to take a taxi to Yotsukaido.<br />
But no worries. Tomorrow is another day, and another adventure in Japan!</p>
