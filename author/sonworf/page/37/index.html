	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not since Kathryn returned to Toronto have I had some time off. I&#8217;ve been a busy little beaver, cutting down on the amount of work that&#8217;s been heaped on me in the past few weeks and months. So it goes without saying that one can get a little tired.<br />
I had planned to go in this weekend and try to work out more of the reports I&#8217;m working on. I came in early Saturday afternoon, and promptly accomplished nothing. Every word I typed, I erased. It was one of those days where nothing made sense, and every sentence only succeeded in detrimenting the entire report. A sure sign of exhaustion. So when Cory (my department head) suggested an evening out to relax, it seemed like a really good idea.<br />
Four of us from Web Development (Cory, Dennis, Shawn, and yours truly) along with one Designer (Neil, who regularly hangs out with Dennis and Shawn) found our way down to Chinook Bowling. Neil drove, which was a little odd, since it was almost impossible to see out Neil&#8217;s windows (they were a little foggy and dirty), and he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure of where the alley was. He kept saying that it was a bit of an &#8220;odd&#8221; door, but that he&#8217;d recognize it &#8212; a key thing because (according to Neil), there was no sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found the door.<br />
Right under a large red sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found, a bit to our chagrin, that we&#8217;d walked into a five-pin bowlerama, instead of the 10-pin, which I think we&#8217;d actually been hoping for. I don&#8217;t think we cared too much. Sure, some consider five-pin to be a retarded way to play &#8230; but they don&#8217;t play it the way we did.<br />
I should quickly detail the setting. Like most mall bowling alleys, it was in a basement. Built in the late 60s, it had received some more recent technology (computerized scoring, new lighting), but it was otherwise unchanged since it opened &#8230; including the shoes. (They are, I think, the worst shoes I&#8217;ve ever had to use. Which of course makes the experience all that much better.) The alley was packed with people, though I&#8217;m pretty sure we were among the oldest there. Certainly we were one of a small handful who had beer.<br />
Only moments after arriving, Cory&#8217;s name was called, indicating that a lane was now open. We hurried on with our shoes and headed directly for the awaiting lane. Our names were already entered into the computer system, appearing on the monitor above our lane. The five lonely pins glowed a purply tinge way off in the distance.<br />
Glowed? Oh yeah, missed that detail &#8212; it was glow in the dark bowling. Although the only thing that really glowed were the pins. The balls were they typical mottled black spheres. It&#8217;s probably a good thing they didn&#8217;t glow &#8212; if the staff had seen what we were doing with them, we&#8217;d have been kicked out before the end of the first game.<br />
I can actually remember the last time I went bowling &#8212; 5 December 1999 (see [[How to Throw a Surprise Party]]). My ex&#8217;s birthday. I had thrown her a surprise party (which had nearly given me an ulcer from the stress), and it had ultimately ended up in the Commodore Lanes. No glow bowl, though.<br />
I&#8217;ve noticed two things about my bowling ability. First, it seems to get better after a beer or two (although more than that has a severely inverse affect). Second, and this is the really bizarre one, I bowl better in the dark. I&#8217;ll never figure that one out&#8230;<br />
It took only a frame before Neil decided that our names weren&#8217;t right. So he took the liberty of changing them, usually when that particular person was up to roll. We went through many name changes, but I cannot really tell you what the final names we ended up with were. Not because I don&#8217;t remember (because I do), and not because they used objectionable words (otherwise we certainly would have been kicked out), but because the terms are &#8230; well &#8230; they carry certain meanings which I&#8217;d prefer not to have to explain.<br />
Not to mention that I don&#8217;t entirely understand them myself.<br />
My first game was off to a slow start (they usually do). But after a few throws, I began to remember how to throw a five-pin ball, and managed to sneak out in front by the time the round was over. The second game went completely to pot, and everyone but Cory and myself were trying new and unusual (and probably illegal in a few states) throws. For example, both Dennis and Shawn tried to throw the balls like you would in a baseball or softball game, though making sure that the ball didn&#8217;t bounce too hard. Dennis&#8217; most profound shot went directly into the gutter, but then ricocheted out, and managed to knock down the right two pins. For a couple of throws, Neil didn&#8217;t even get out of his chair, but opted to throw the ball from the bench. His accuracy wasn&#8217;t too bad, admittedly. I managed to win that round too, with a pitiful 165.<br />
Cory suggested that we attempt to get serious for our third game, but it&#8217;s hard to be serious when you have a hard time walking in a straight line. My game utterly fell apart, and was barely able to cross 100. I might have done better had we not run out of time on the game &#8230; and if the lights hadn&#8217;t come back on. Once I was able to see where I was throwing, my aim went totally off. Go figure. Cory won with a 188.<br />
Opting to leave the alley (being the only ones left, our rather unusual bowling styles were attracting a lot of attention), we headed over to Kensington for a post-game snack, and to discuss the future of our newly-formed bowling team &#8212; The Steamers (and no, I&#8217;m not telling you the full name). Neil, Dennis, and I made light of our short journey by singing Wayne Newton&#8217;s &#8220;Danke Schoen&#8221; at the top of our lungs, particularly when we managed to pull  up next to Cory&#8217;s truck. You can only imagine what it must have been like to have three mildly inebriated 20-somethings (barely) harmonizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recall Central Park in fall,<br />
how you tore your dress,<br />
what a mess,<br />
I confess&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I paid for it the following morning, and most of day. But you&#8217;d be surprised how much a good bout of dim sum can take the edge off a hangover (albeit a mild one). Even then, though, I didn&#8217;t feel decent until around 6pm that night, when the Academy Awards hit the airwaves.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably wondering what I thought of them. (And even if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m telling you anyway.) This was a tough year for the Academy. Lots of really crappy movies means that only a handful are good enough to even consider, which means that the criteria between all the movies isn&#8217;t easy. Okay, so let&#8217;s look at the ones I had problems with (you can assume I agreed with the rest):<br />
Best Supporting Actor: Benicio Del Toro (Traffic)<br />
Okay, this isn&#8217;t so much a problem as I wanted Willem Dafoe to win for Shadow of the Vampire. Although the movie itself wasn&#8217;t worth nominating, his performance saved it from being a waste of celluloid. Were it up to me, I would have picked Dafoe.<br />
Best Actress: Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich)<br />
Yes, she&#8217;s attractive. Yes, she can act a million times better than her brother, Eric. But did she really deserve it? Well, there&#8217;s the $30 million dollar question (which is, ironically enough, probably what she&#8217;s gonna start asking for). Now, admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen Erin Brockovich, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a good movie. (I&#8217;ve seen enough clips.) However, this is Julia Roberts we&#8217;re talking about. Both Chris and I have extreme reservations when it comes to her winning over performances such as Ellen Burstyn (Requiem For A Dream) who was utterly astounding, or even Bjork (Dancer In The Dark), who wasn&#8217;t even nominated for an Oscar! So why did Julia win? It was &#8220;her year&#8221;. She&#8217;s paid her dues, regardless of the talent of others. (Yeah, I sound a little bitter. I&#8217;m annoyed that the Academy still seems to work this way.)<br />
Best Actor: Russell Crowe (Gladiator)<br />
Okay, yes, he did an excellent performance, and he is a good actor. But I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it was all the lobbying that got him the award. I&#8217;ve heard amazing reviews of Ed Harris&#8217; performance in Pollock, which to me looks more worthy. Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen it, so this is mostly just me wondering about Hollywood. Not so much as with Best Picture, though.<br />
Best Director: Steven Soderbergh (Traffic)<br />
Steve&#8217;s a good director, I&#8217;ll give him that. And certainly with two nominations, he certainly upped his chances. But when you look at Traffic and compare it with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I&#8217;m gonna abbreviate it to CTHD, &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s a lot to type), there isn&#8217;t much of a contest. The goal of a director is to provide the coordination and overall feeling for the movie. I&#8217;m sure Steve had a lot to do with that. But two things: 1) Traffic was based on a British series of the same name, so ol&#8217; Stevie had something existing to work with. 2) When it comes to having to manage sheer complexity, and being an utter nit-pick to get the scene just right, you can&#8217;t beat the tenacity that Ang Lee showed. (I know, because I read about it.) So yeah, I don&#8217;t agree with this one.<br />
Best Picture: Gladiator<br />
Wow. What a surprise. I think Chris and I both knew that Hollywood still wasn&#8217;t quite ready to choose a movie like CTHD as its best of the year. Disappointing in a way &#8212; CTHD embodied most of what movie-making has tried to create. That&#8217;s not to reduce Gladiator&#8217;s success even in the slightest &#8212; it, too, did an excellent job. But with both Life Is Beautiful and CTHD being nominated for Best Picture awards, maybe the future holds a more global view than the typical American fare.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life is abdunant with difficult experiences. Some come from education, some from your job, some from a close relationship with a potential life partner. But there are few experiences that are as hard as saying goodbye to good friends.<br />
Critical Mass is opening an office in Toronto. Its first day of business is Monday the 19th. We&#8217;re staffing it with some people who were hired and brought here, and with some who were here and want to go back east. Tonight, Critical Mass said a fond farewell to 23 of its own, as they prepare to embark on a journey to the centre of the Universe (otherwise known as Toronto) and open our new office.<br />
It could have been more emotional, I suppose, but that&#8217;s probably why there was free alcohol, to keep us placated. (In retrospect, not a bad thing.) But it still didn&#8217;t dull the pain of seeing people leave. I know most of the people who are going, either by working with them or being on the same team.<br />
Today I said goodbye to three good friends: Dave, Mike, and Jen.<br />
Dave was the one who interviewed me when I first walked through Critical Mass&#8217; doors just over a year ago. I remember the interview well, thinking I was in a lot of trouble because I couldn&#8217;t figure out what he wanted. Dave&#8217;s got a good poker face. It wasn&#8217;t until we struck upon movies that he seemed to lighten up. Not a month later, I was seated a desk away from Dave, and since then have been fortunate to know Dave quite well. We spent several very long days and nights during the summer working on our respective projects, often staying until the wee hours of the morning alternating between coding and acting goofy.<br />
Mike was also in my department, but because he sat in a different area, I really didn&#8217;t get to know him until a couple of months after I got here. Mike&#8217;s wit and passion for independent films was what set him apart from most people, as did his fascination (some call it obsession) with strange video games like &#8220;Samba De Amigo&#8221;.<br />
I first met Jen on the night before we were to deliver a pitch for a potential client. She and Chris had been engaged in heavy conversation when I arrived. We found that she shared the same birthday as Chris and I, which created some sort of strange bond between the three of us. Jen and I have since seen a couple of Tuesday night movies (&#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221; and &#8220;Chocolat&#8221;) and had a few deep conversations of our own. I&#8217;ve known Jen for only just over four months, but it feels like it&#8217;s been much longer.<br />
I&#8217;ve been preparing for this day for a long time, but it seems so surreal to have it finally arrive. Not an hour ago, I watched Dave and Mike drive away into the night, knowing that there would be no more game nights with them, no more breakfasts or lunches, no more movies. Soon, I will say goodbye to Jen, and she, too, will disappear into the night. No more deep conversations over pints of Guinness about movies or strange things that have happened in our lives.<br />
They&#8217;re still a part of Critical Mass, but they might as well have moved to the other side of the world for all it really matters. They&#8217;re not here.<br />
Last night, I went out with Dave for his second-to-last night in Calgary. I drank more than I would normally, probably to dull the pain. Tonight, I found myself doing the same again. Were I more sober, I would realise how much it hurts. I did my best to laugh and joke as Dave and Mike drove away, all the time feeling my insides twisting up into a single tight knot.<br />
Tomorrow, I will come to work, and see three empty desks where my friends used to sit. I&#8217;ll see their ghosts for days, maybe even weeks to come. Sure, there will always be email, but it&#8217;s never quite the same as being with them. This I know from experience.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to good friends.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One year and one day ago, I did the hardest thing I&#8217;d ever done in my life: I said goodbye to Vancouver, to Radical Entertainment, and my friends. I then started a new life.<br />
Last year, I spent a month living in a city that I&#8217;d only been to three times before. I had two things in my favour: 1) I was living with family (my Aunt, Uncle, and cousin), and 2) I had time to myself to think, contemplate, and rebuild.<br />
It&#8217;s been 12 months since I arrived here. I look back at what I used to be, who I used to be, and I&#8217;m pleased that I bid farewell to that person &#8230; to that life. It was a dead-end for me, one of mental hardship and emotional strife. It&#8217;s something no-one should have to experience willingly.<br />
But I would be lying if I said I got here alone. Very few things can be done in life without help from others, and rarely does that help come without request. I had lots of help and support. From Joel, who helped me pack up my belongings; from Greg, who not only packed, but help me drive to Calgary; from my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, and cousin Jen, who made me feel welcome in their home and provided me with the shelter I needed to restart; from all of my friends, near and far, who supported me in my decision; from my family, whose concern kept me going; and most of all from my sister Cathy, who became my pillar of strength in my hour of greatest need.<br />
Basically, if you&#8217;re reading this, you have contributed, even in some small way, to who I am. Even if all you did was send me an email joke, it was enough to brighten a day. To all of you, I say &#8220;Thanks&#8221;.<br />
I suppose I should go out and celebrate, rejoice in the freedom and happiness I enjoy. But it wouldn&#8217;t change much &#8212; I celebrate each and every moment, each and every friend and family member.<br />
May the years to come bring you as much happiness.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s amazing how old friends can make you feel young.<br />
A week and four days ago, Kathryn, one of our closest friends, came out to visit us (Chris, Stuart, Therese, and myself). The five of us all went to OTHS, and though we might have graduated different years, we&#8217;ve still been fast friends, and have kept contact over the years.<br />
Kathryn, like most of my closest friends, is an artist &#8230; specifically, the theatre arts. She&#8217;s a stage manager. Stage managers are responsible for making sure that a production goes off without a hitch. If it happens on, above, behind, below, in front, or off stage, it&#8217;s the Stage Manager who make sure it happens when it&#8217;s supposed to happen. It&#8217;s a hard job, and not everyone can do it. Kathryn lives for it.<br />
Unfortunately, it&#8217;s also not easy to get work &#8230; especially if you&#8217;re trying to break into the Toronto scene, which Kathryn is. She&#8217;s worked for years around Eastern Ontario, but getting work in Toronto is very difficult when you&#8217;re not there to get it. This is how Kathryn ended up with two months with nothing to do. This is also how Kathryn got the time to come out for a visit.<br />
Given, Alberta&#8217;s not the most inviting place in the middle of February &#8230; Mexico seems to be the popular destination this year for Albertans &#8230; but there are the few diehard skiers that make their way out here (despite the worst skiing conditions in years). And at least one person who came to see us, and what else was in our otherwise barren and snow-covered province.<br />
I took a few days off, partly because I needed to (you have no idea how bad I actually needed a vacation), and partly so I wouldn&#8217;t feel like we invited someone out only to ignore them. This, in retrospect, was probably the wisest thing I did. I had no idea how badly I actually needed to take a break. Yeah, I know, I went home for Christmas &#8230; but still, I needed the break.<br />
Kathryn came to Calgary on 15 February. I got up early that morning to finish cleaning up a bit: Vacuumed, cleaned the kitchen, wiped the floors, did a quick load of laundry, and bought a small vase of flowers for the night table (my room is a little spartan &#8212; I thought it could use a little colour and fragrance). I arrived at the airport about five minutes before Kathryn&#8217;s plane was to land. Figures that when I&#8217;m running a little late, so is Kathryn&#8217;s flight. She arrived about 45 minutes later, and was quite happy not only to be on terra firma, but in Calgary &#8212; she&#8217;d never been here before.<br />
Soon we arrived at our apartment, where I introduced Kathryn to her temporary home from home, and our roommate, Miao Yin. That was when I realized I&#8217;m either a really good listener, or psychic. Kathryn, who grew up with two cats, has sadly become allergic to them. As such, I had made sure that my bedroom (which was where Kathryn would sleep) was Miao Yin-free, not an easy task, let me tell you. &#8220;Curiosity killed the cat&#8221; isn&#8217;t just some quaint saying.<br />
Plopping on one of the couches, we talked for about three or so hours, when Chris finally came home. We ordered out for dinner that night, not wanting to get off to too fast a start &#8230; and not having a lot of food in the apartment worth cooking. Besides, Kathryn was dying to have Chinese served in one of those fancy paper boxes.<br />
When bedtime finally arrived, Kathryn retired to my room. She was a little dismayed at first that I was giving up my bed, but Chris and I will quite willingly offer our beds to our guests. So yes, I can safely say that I had a beautiful woman sleep in my bed for a week&#8230;<br />
&#8230;but I slept on the couch.<br />
(It&#8217;s not that bad. Our couches may be ugly as sin, but they&#8217;re quite comfy.)<br />
The next day, I Kathryn got a walking tour of downtown Calgary &#8230; from inside. The original plan had been to walk down 8th Ave to Theatre Calgary. However, the weather decided that it would disagree, and nearly froze us to death. We went into the +15 for comfort.<br />
The +15, for those of you who&#8217;ve never of it, is an above-ground series of walkways, not unlike Toronto&#8217;s underground PATH system. Same principle, same contents, just 30 feet in the opposite direction. A movie was made about it recently, called &#8220;Waydowntown&#8221;. Kathryn thought it was quite funny. I&#8217;ll have to see it sometime.<br />
We wound our way from the Husky building, through the parking garage (which is enclosed), through Penny Lane, and into the Eaton Centre, through the TD Centre, Home Oil Building, and ultimately into The Bay, where the trail ended. Then we braved the frigid outdoors to cross the street and duck into A&amp;B Sound. Kathryn wanted to see was the prices were like, and hey, it never hurts to go into a music store.<br />
Kathryn came out with nothing. I didn&#8217;t fare that lucky&#8230; (Enough with the snickering!) As we were trying to hunt down Great Big Sea&#8217;s &#8220;Play&#8221; album for Kathryn (hers had been snitched), she remembered some music I had to listen to: Afro-Celt Sound System. I&#8217;d never heard of them before, but I&#8217;m quite willing to take my friends&#8217; advice (especially those who share musical tastes) and go out on a limb. Both albums are great!<br />
Ducking out of A&amp;B Sound, we braved the cold for a couple of blocks until we got to Theatre Calgary. Calgary is a strange city. Most cities have theatre areas &#8230; Calgary has a theatre block. The whole block. A BIG block. There&#8217;s a concert hall, and six or seven theatres crammed into one space. Makes a night out easy to find, I&#8217;ll say&#8230;<br />
Kathryn is a theatre junkie, which makes sense, given her chosen profession. She wanted to see what else was playing, and if it was possible to see anything. Of the available plays, none really fell into a schedule that seemed to fit with anything. The only really interesting one was &#8220;The Vagina Monologues&#8221;, which is (from what I&#8217;ve heard) very good. Unfortunately, I could not find out if it was possible to get tickets in advance (all I got was a hard-to-understand answering machine).<br />
Leaving Theatre Calgary (toting a large number of pamphlets for theatre information), we walked the three blocks to Critical Mass. No, I was not going to work. I was taking Kathryn on a tour, after which we were going to meet up with Chris for lunch. It wasn&#8217;t an easy tour &#8212; I was trying not to be spotted and dragged into a discussion that, really, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.<br />
After distracting Chris from his work for about an hour and a half, Kathryn and I headed out for more exploration. Again, Calgary&#8217;s biting wind chased us indoors. This seemed like a good time to see how far we could walk in the +15. Although we had to go outside for a short while (the +15 has a few orphaned sections, due to the rapid pace of construction in downtown Calgary), we eventually found our way to the Sheraton Hotel, across the street from Eau Claire Market.<br />
Among many things, Kathryn was looking for gifts for friends of hers whose birthdays were fast approaching. While we found nothing for them, Kathryn was overjoyed to find a store that sold British chocolates. We also purchased four bottles of wine (not to be drunk all at one time).<br />
The walk back took us to within one block of our apartment, all indoors. After dumping our wares, we made a hasty visit to the Safeway to get groceries for dinner. I was going to attempt my first curry in months, and Kathryn was promising to make us chilli one night.<br />
We spent another (reasonably) quiet night in, watching TV and talking amongst ourselves. My curry was a bit of a disaster (although I was immensely happy that the rice turned out beautifully) &#8212; I&#8217;m out of practice. I need to make it a bit more frequently.<br />
Saturday was a bit of write-off as far as tourism goes. In preparation for Kathryn&#8217;s visit, I got my car tuned up and repaired &#8230; to the tune of almost $1,600. I won&#8217;t go into detail of what needed fixing, but suffice to say, it was stuff that I should have had looked at two years ago. (Unfortunately for me, at the time I had someone telling me that I was better off selling the car than getting it fixed.) It runs like a dream now &#8212; probably better than when I first got it. However, there had been one little problem &#8212; the brakes had given out a couple of days after I got the car back. I had the brakes fixed again (gratis, luckily), but I had been told to bring the car back for a double-check after I&#8217;d driven it a while. This was the first day I had the chance.<br />
So Kathryn put up with a 2-hour wait for the 10-minute inspection. I felt really bad, because she had flown 3,000 kilometres to wander around a mall and wait for something that I should&#8217;ve done before she arrived.<br />
During this time, we raided the nearby Costco for snack food and pop (Chris had invited people over for that evening). Normally, we drive to Costco. Anyone with an ounce of sense would drive to the Costco. Except me, of course. Figuring we had time to kill anyway, we went over to Costco and picked up two flats of pop and some frozen snacks. That was the easy part. The hard part was the walk back to the car. With two armfuls of pop and frozen food. Believe me, that stuff ain&#8217;t light. If we hadn&#8217;t stumbled across an abandoned shopping cart on our return trip, I don&#8217;t think my arms would&#8217;ve survived.<br />
The car not having yet moved, we retreated into the mall. This was fortunate on one account &#8212; the mall had a Payless Shoe store. And Kathryn needed a new pair of shoes. They had just what she was looking for.<br />
After wandering around for a short while, we stopped, had a drink &#8212; a mochaccino for Kathryn, and a hot chocolate for me &#8212; and shared some conversation. Kathryn and I talked a lot. About almost everything. But a lot of it, at least at first, was about how each of us were doing. Kathryn&#8217;s busy schedule only gives us brief glimpses into her life through sporadic email messages. And there are a lot of things that just don&#8217;t seem to make it into these logs &#8212; sometimes because it might make people feel uncomfortable, and sometimes because I just plain forgot.<br />
Finally deciding that the car should be ready (they hadn&#8217;t called me), we returned to the garage to pick it up. All was well, and we were on our way. Not long after getting back, our first guest arrived &#8212; Adrian, one of our co-workers at Critical Mass. Adrian brought a unique twist to our evening, a device that I had not actively played with since the early 80s.<br />
An Atari 2600.<br />
Okay, I should mention something before I get too far ahead of myself. Chris and I hold &#8220;game nights&#8221; on a pseudo-regular basis. We own a Dreamcast. No, not the most recent gaming system, but one that was relatively inexpensive, and has a lot of really good games available. (Not to mention that we found a good place to get games &#8230; uh &#8230; cheap, so our initial library was pretty decent.) We invite a group of people we know to be gamers, and we go nuts for upwards of six hours, beating each other into virtual pulps. Our neighbours must wonder what the hell goes on in our apartment. It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;ve got nice, thick, concrete walls.<br />
Anyway, back to the Atari. I hadn&#8217;t played one of these since I was a kid. But the old graphics, the sounds, and the action came back fast. The four of us got into the games very quickly. It was a lot of fun. I had originally been apprehensive that Kathryn would spend a third boring night in, made worse by watching a bunch of guys scream and yell over video games. For the record, Kathryn was utterly enthralled with the Atari &#8212; she remembered it well.<br />
Several people had arrived by the time Kathryn and I left. We were going to the Calgary Tower, Kathryn&#8217;s first real touristy activity. She wanted to see a sunset over the mountains, and this is about as good a place to see it as any. Not to mention, it&#8217;s a nice view of the entire city.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d been up Calgary Tower was in August of 1997, when Gerry and I blindly wandered around downtown Calgary trying to figure out what there was to see. I can still remember not knowing what we were looking at or where we were going. Today it all seems to simple&#8230;<br />
For those of you who have never experienced it, a sunset from Calgary Tower, especially on a clear day, it really quite something to behold. It attracts a bit of a crowd, too, for obvious reasons. We circled the tower a few times (which doesn&#8217;t take long &#8212; it&#8217;s not that big), and I pointed out some of the more significant landmarks. Kathryn sighed in excitement &#8212; she wanted to go to the mountains badly. That was a promise for Monday.<br />
About 10 minutes after sunset, we returned to street level, and headed back to the apartment. More people had arrived, and the Atari had been replaced with the Dreamcast &#8212; and tennis. Yeah, tennis. Not the most riveting of games &#8230; or so you&#8217;d think. In reality, this was probably one of the most popular games to hit it big in our game nights in quite a while. People were yelling and screaming, the trash talk flew, and as people got more practice, the games got more intense. Kathryn got complete into the insanity, and even started hamming it up with Dave (another co-worker), giving names to all the characters on screen. Even Stuart showed up for his first game night, and was immediately sucked into the mayhem.<br />
Things only got worse with Samba De Amigo. This is one of those really bizarre Japanese games that periodically make to North America. It&#8217;s a musical game &#8212; the graphics are almost irrelevant &#8212; that you play with &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; maracas.<br />
No, I&#8217;m not making this up.<br />
You plug in a pair of maracas. There are sensors that figure out where they&#8217;re being held, and there are accelerometers in the balls to detect when (and how hard) you shake them. This is basically the only game they&#8217;re used for, and to put it mildly, the game is just plain nuts. It was quite popular &#8230; after the initial shock wore off, anyway.<br />
Sunday morning was dim sum morning. This is a near-ritual for some of us, making our way down to Chinatown and bulking up on bite-size morsels of Oriental goodness. We met up with Stuart, Therese, and Janine, and couldn&#8217;t wait to get to a table and start the feast.<br />
After dim sum, Janine took off with friends, leaving the five of us to our post-dim sum ritual &#8230; shopping. Normally we go to the mall downtown, but periodically, we venture down to Chinook Centre, the best mall in town. We toured in and out of a few stores, looking at interesting things, but not really biting at the offered wares. The only real purchases came at Black&#8217;s Camera, where Therese and Kathryn took the opportunity to stock up on film.<br />
We headed back downtown, in search of activities to keep us occupied for the remainder of the afternoon. Kathryn suggested we stop in at the Glenbow Museum, and see what there was to see. That was when we found out about the Glenbow&#8217;s peculiar sales habits &#8212; they sell only a limited number of tickets for the day. When we got there, they were sold out. As you can imagine, that had us quite confused &#8212; it&#8217;s a museum, not a concert! But the Glenbow limits the tickets so all their visitors will receive an enjoyable experience, rather than packing the place full.<br />
We ended up retreating to our apartment, to strike up a brief game of tennis. Therese and Stuart stuck around that evening, and the five of us spent a lazy Sunday night having dinner, talking, and watching the Sunday night line-up.<br />
Monday was Family Day in Alberta, an odd statutory holiday cooked up (assumedly) for the auspices of getting more skiing in during the winter. In any case, Chris and I both had the day off (Stuart&#8217;s company defers the day to later in the year, and Therese just needed to get work done without anyone bugging her) and so took Kathryn into the Canadian Rockies.<br />
The morning was grey &#8230; well, actually white. It wasn&#8217;t snowing, but the sky looked like someone had accidentally bleached the blue out. I was a bit apprehensive about going &#8212; I really wanted Kathryn to experience Banff on a nice day &#8212; but she insisted that it was worth the risk. I guess after stalling for four days, she was ready to go, no matter what the weather was like.<br />
After a quick run to my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s to borrow their park pass, we headed towards the mountains. Normally, you can see the mountains as soon as you clear Calgary city limits (which happen to be at the top of a hill which blocks the view of the mountains), but the weather was so bleak that we couldn&#8217;t see anything until we were within 20 kilometres.<br />
Luckily for us, the weather started clear within a few minutes of arriving in Banff, just as the Weather Channel had predicted. By the time we climbed out of the car, blue sky was clearly visible. An hour later, we had to wear sunglasses as not to be blinded.<br />
Our first stop was at the Cave and Basin (yeah, I know it&#8217;s becoming a habit). Unlike previous tours, we didn&#8217;t actually go into the cave, but walked around on the outside. Then it was over to the new(er) hot springs on the east side of Sulphur Mountain. Kathryn was utter giddy with delight from all the vistas that she could see. Then it was down to the Bow Falls below the Banff Springs Hotel, and then to the hotel itself.<br />
The hotel&#8217;s changed since I was last there with Cathy and Craig. Back then, you entered the hotel through the &#8220;rear&#8221; of the hotel. At the time, the hotel was adding a new entrance on the &#8220;front&#8221;. That construction is now complete, and you can no longer enter the old way. The new entrance is much more impressive, though.<br />
In what looks like an effort to spruce up the appearance of the hotel, CP Hotels is changing the ethos of the old place, and making it into a castle. The new entrance is a Great Hall, complete with grey stone work, long corridors with austere appearances, and new staircases and wall faces that resemble something out of a dark ages keep. Unfortunately, it also meant that all the restaurants were closed for the renovation &#8230; lunch was out that day.<br />
We stopped again just on the north side of the Banff Street bridge, so Kathryn could get a good picture looking through the downtown, towards Cascade Mountain (which she absolutely fell in love with). This was our base for wandering around town for the next hour or so. We wandered up Banff Street to the Visitor&#8217;s Information Centre (which I had last visited some three and a half years ago with Gerry), then across the street for a quick drink at a nearby Second Cup, then by the fudge shop, and finally back to the car.<br />
Then it was off to Lake Louise. It had been an off-the-cuff suggestion, and everyone seemed game. We got there about 30 minutes before sunset (sunset at Lake Louise, that is &#8212; the sun wouldn&#8217;t set for another hour or so), so had ample light to look around.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d seen the lake totally frozen. I had been there in late May once, and the lake had still been ice-covered, but this was so well frozen that people could hike all over its surface. Which is precisely what we ended up doing&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s quite an experience to hike to the middle of Lake Louise. You&#8217;re about a kilometre from anything. Mountains on three sides, and a itty-bitty little hotel on the fourth. (In the middle of the lake, the hotel is quite small.) Aside from a few other people, you&#8217;re alone. It&#8217;s quiet &#8212; no cars, no planes, nothing there to take away from the beauty of the land. The soft, white snow extends smoothly until it reaches the mountains, then gives way to an upthrust of white, beige, brown, red, and black. The sun casts stark shadows in the jagged rock, and it seems so odd because there&#8217;s absolutely no noise.<br />
Chris has recently started a search for his spirituality. It&#8217;s given the two of us many an occasion for deeply philosophical conversations. Kathryn had played devil&#8217;s advocate with Chris a couple nights earlier, not questioning why Chris was searching, but wanting to know his reasons. (The only real way to see someone&#8217;s thought processes is to ask them hard questions.) Kathryn had posed Chris a question: &#8220;What does God give you?&#8221; Chris has answered it adequately at the time. As the three of us stood in the middle of the lake, staring at sights that few people in the world could even imagine, he quietly said: &#8220;This is what God gives me.&#8221; There was no rebuttal.<br />
We walked about 9/10ths the length of the lake before turning back. The walk up wasn&#8217;t an easy one &#8212; the uneven path was hard-packed snow, barely a foot and a half wide by the time we turned around. We were regularly slipping off into the powdery surrounding snow. Chris trudged through the powder uneventfully, his boots and long underwear protecting him from the cold. The walk back was considerably easier, as the west side of the lake had a fairly wide area of packed snow.<br />
After a quick stop in the hotel to use the facilities, we hit the road for our trip back to Calgary. The sun set as we drove, and by the time we reached the city limits, it was dark. A little too dark. It looked like my headlights weren&#8217;t working. A quick stop at a gas station revealed that while light was being emitted by my headlights, all the dirt and salt from our day&#8217;s excursion had made the glass almost completely opaque. A quick wipe with a wet squeegee fixed that.<br />
The following day was cool and bright &#8212; the perfect day for spending a few hours buried in a museum. This time, Kathryn and I got tickets, and spent the day in glorious education at the Glenbow Museum. Kathryn, like myself, is a reader. Whereas Cathy and Craig might be able to blitz through the Royal Tyrell Museum in 30 minutes, Kathryn and I spent three and a half hours reading nearly every word on Asian art and sculpture (mostly revolving around Hindu and Buddhist artefacts) and on the Egyptian culture (courtesy of a travelling exhibit). We only managed to get through one floor before we had to stop. Our brains hurt from the information overload.<br />
On our way home, we stopped into a Second Cup for refreshments, and what ended up being a nice long conversation. It started out with me apologizing for being such a dullard. You&#8217;re probably wondering why I did that? Well, it&#8217;s not easy to explain. Chris and Kathryn have a much more animated conversational style, certainly one that looks more interesting and exciting than the one she has with me. With Chris, they laugh, exchange mock insults, and carry on in a more exuberant manner. With me, things are more &#8230; well, dull. I felt bad about that. I honestly felt like Kathryn was bored out of her mind being around me so much, because I&#8217;m such a dull person. (And yes, I have to admit that I&#8217;m dull. And if you disagree with me, I&#8217;ll point you to my dating history.)<br />
Kathryn was quick to object. (She is a good friend, after all.) She brought up an interesting point that I hadn&#8217;t really considered before. (Which is ironic, considering her point was something I&#8217;d noted many times since high school.) Kathryn is artistic &#8212; she sings, she acts, she works in theatre. Chris is artistic &#8212; he sings, he creates imagery, he&#8217;s an excellent photographer. I&#8217;m not artistic &#8212; I can&#8217;t sing to save my life, can&#8217;t even draw a good-looking stick person, can&#8217;t act my way out of a paper bag. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a geek. I&#8217;ve always been a geek &#8212; even when I was a little kid, I was a geek. I wanted to know how everything worked (which is why I went through a few portable cassette players before I figured that taking another apart didn&#8217;t serve any purpose).<br />
Kathryn called me &#8220;philosophical&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s a general thing, or if that&#8217;s just because of the conversations I&#8217;d been having with her to that point (she&#8217;d asked me if I were a different person, and I&#8217;d ended up waxing poetic for about a half hour on my personal development over the past year). I suppose in a way I am philosophical &#8230; but I gotta tell ask, what woman would find that interesting? Again, I point you to my dating history&#8230;<br />
That evening, Kathryn and I make use of cheap Tuesday, and caught a showing of &#8220;O Brother, Where Are Thou?&#8221;, the Coen Brothers&#8217; latest cinematic outing. We thoroughly enjoyed the movie &#8212; it&#8217;s a great mythic romp through 1930&#8217;s southern United States. We didn&#8217;t find it nearly as funny as a guy a row or two back from us. Everyone&#8217;s seen or heard of the stereotypically loud-mouthed moron who finds something as trivial as a guy sneezing the funniest thing ever put on film. Well, that night we met one. I&#8217;m reasonably certain we weren&#8217;t the only ones in the theatre who wanted to gag and bind him for the duration of the movie. I feel sorry for the friends who go with him &#8230; assuming he has any.<br />
Wednesday was another educational trek through Alberta, this time to Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, about two hours south of Calgary. This is a location where, until 120 years (but starting over 5,500 years ago), Native tribes would drive herds of buffalo off a cliff. Head-Smashed-In is one of the best preserved, and due to the outstanding Interpretation Centre built nearby, has earned a place as a UNESCO site.<br />
It was Kathryn&#8217;s first visit to the Prairies. The drive down afforded her a constantly changing contrast of rolling hills, flat plains, and distant mountain vistas. (Not to mention a few oil well pumps.) Kathryn was so happy to be engaging in touristy activities that I sometimes wondered if I really needed to be there. (I&#8217;ve seen most of this stuff before, so I was only there as a pseudo tour guide.)<br />
We arrived at the Buffalo Jump just before noon. The first stop in the tour is along the ridge where buffalo used to plunge to their deaths. (Buffalo have very poor eyesight, and the Native tribes were able to exploit this deficiency under the right conditions.) It&#8217;s to introduce you to the site before you learn about it. Up there, you can&#8217;t hear a thing. It&#8217;s dead silent. Oppressively silent. It&#8217;s almost deafening. For city folk, it can be a bit unnerving. I find it hugely relaxing. We had a few moments of silence before we were bombarded by a small group of Native kids, who were assumedly on an excursion to learn about their heritage.<br />
We spent about three and a half hours at Head-Smashed-In, learning (and in my case, relearning) the history of the site, and the way of the peoples who use the site. I was glad I&#8217;d come &#8212; my knowledge had managed to distort a little since my last visit.<br />
We left for home around 3:30 in the afternoon. We made a brief stop in Fort MacLeod, about 5 minutes further south on Highway 2 so Kathryn could get a bite to eat. I was beginning to come down with a cold, and my appetite had vanished. But soon we were on our way back home.<br />
That night, Chris, Kathryn, and I went to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s apartment for dinner. It was like old times &#8212; really old times. We&#8217;ve all known each other for 10 years. We&#8217;d all gotten together at Christmas, but this was a little different. We were in a homey environment, without having to yell above the teeming masses. It was one of those times when you know that no matter what may come, we&#8217;ll still be friends when we&#8217;re all retired and living on some sandy shore in a non-extradition country with a low tax rate.<br />
My vacation ended Thursday morning, and it was time for me to go back to work. Kathryn left for Edmonton later that morning to visit with friends. This was a good thing &#8212; my suspected cold was turning into a nasty cold. I drugged myself up heavily and trudged into work to see what I could get done &#8230; and wade through the 100+ email I&#8217;d managed to accumulate in that time.<br />
The only productive thing I got done that day was finally launch Critical Mass&#8217;s new website (http://www.criticalmass.com/). This is what has been sucking up huge amounts of my time since early December. If it hadn&#8217;t been the wait to get client approval on some stuff, we&#8217;d have had it up a long time ago. But our website isn&#8217;t high on our clients&#8217; priorities.<br />
I like this site, and not just because I was the lead developer. I like it because we let the Design department try some interesting ideas that we&#8217;d never tried before. The result is a lot of DHTML animation that had me staring at the ceiling for a few collective days, trying to figure out ways of getting it to work. (Sounds kinda dumb, I know, but when you have to deal with several different browsers across two platforms, it&#8217;s more work than you think.)<br />
The launch complete, I bailed for home as my cold decided to take me down. I called in sick on Friday, the cold having taken me down completely. (I could have gone in, but I figured I&#8217;d get just as much work done at the office as I would sleeping at home.)<br />
Kathryn and her housemate Mareca (I hope that&#8217;s the correct spelling) returned to Calgary Saturday afternoon. Kathryn and Mareca have been friends for quite a while, so I understand, and are both in the theatre biz. Mareca&#8217;s a little older than Kathryn (having just turned 30 &#8212; though she&#8217;s far too cute to be 30, in my humble opinion), but has the energy of someone 10 years younger.<br />
Kathryn, Mareca, Mareca&#8217;s friend Karen, and I were going to a play that night. Mareca had a friend in the production who got us half-price tickets, and it seemed like fun. Besides, I&#8217;d never seen Camelot before. The show was quite good, though being a theatre novice (I&#8217;ve only seen a few productions), I was happier with the performance than the other three. They pulled it apart. But not half as bad as Bryce, who played Mordred.<br />
Bryce is an old friend of Mareca, and is an accomplished actor. He&#8217;s also got a great singing voice (I still have &#8220;Fie On Goodness&#8221; reverberating around in my head) and a great sense of humour. I got to know him a little, as he came back with us to the apartment, where I exchanged my place in the group with Chris so they could go out to a &#8220;party&#8221; to dance the night away. While the idea was appealing, my cold was winding down, and spending several hours in a smoky environment was a good way to drag that cold out for days.<br />
We took Kathryn and Mareca out for dim sum on their last day in Calgary. Bryce and Karen also attended, as did Stuart and Therese. (Stuart and Therese ended up leaving early, due to Stuart&#8217;s ankle, which he sprained earlier in the day.) After our Oriental repast, we gathered Kathryn and Mareca&#8217;s bags and took them to the airport.<br />
Which was strangely packed. Air Canada&#8217;s history of long line-ups (they said they were busy, which was true, but only because half their desks were closed) came back again. Luckily, instead of the hour wait, Kathryn and Mareca were able to use the Express check-in, and were ready in about 20 minutes. For a delayed flight. The five of us grabbed a table in Tim Horton&#8217;s (a truly Canadian tradition) and wasted time. (Of course, you never really waste time with friends.)<br />
When the time came for them to board, we walked them over to the gate and bid them a safe journey. It was strange &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t really sad to see them go. Probably because I knew I&#8217;d see them (or at least Kathryn) again. But when they did finally leave, I could help but notice how empty things suddenly seemed.<br />
We dropped Bryce off at Theatre Calgary so he could get his bike, and then Chris and I returned home. Things didn&#8217;t look any different, but still something seemed missing. Kathryn had been here for over a week &#8212; it was the longest I&#8217;d seen her since &#8230; well, since ever, really.<br />
So on Sunday night, I finally crawled back into my own bed to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. But I couldn&#8217;t. I tossed and turned, feeling a little empty. It could have been that a close friend was gone, and I didn&#8217;t know when I would see her again. It could have been the foreign feeling of being back in my own room. It could have been that I hadn&#8217;t slept in my bed for 10 days.<br />
I should have slept on the couch.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Wednesday, I came home to something different. Chris and I have a new roommate.<br />
Now I knew about this, so it wasn&#8217;t surprise. Nevertheless, it is taking a bit getting used to. She&#8217;s fairly short, a little overweight, a quite aloof. But she&#8217;s quiet, so we all get along. I suppose the only drawback is her tendency to shed.<br />
Oh, did I forget to mention that our new roommate is a cat?<br />
Yes, we have a cat. Her name is Miao-Yin. For those of you who don&#8217;t get the reference immediately, don&#8217;t worry about it. If I were to tell you, you&#8217;d probably say &#8220;Figures&#8230;&#8221;. For those of you who *do* know the reference &#8230; well, you&#8217;ve probably already said &#8220;Figures&#8230;&#8221;<br />
For the record, incidentally, Miao-Yin isn&#8217;t my cat &#8212; she&#8217;s Chris&#8217;. Those of you who know Chris have probably now done the double take I did when he asked to bring in a cat. I was surprised to say the least &#8212; I never pegged Chris as a cat person. Maybe a boa constrictor person, but not a cat person.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m quite happy about having a cat. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve lived with one. (When you&#8217;ve grown up with cats, you really miss them when you don&#8217;t have them.) Miao-Yin&#8217;s fairly old &#8212; 8 years, so her idea of entertainment is watching Chris trying to entertain her. Actually, I can see the humour in that myself. He tries hard, I&#8217;ll give him that, but getting an older cat to do anything is about as useful as flashlight in the middle of the midday desert. He&#8217;ll learn eventually.<br />
Miao-Yin is a black and white domestic shorthair (which means, of course, that she sheds about a pound of fur a day &#8212; Chris has taken to vigorously brushing her every day). In many ways, she resembles my first cat, Sylvester, who died in 1993. I didn&#8217;t really realize how much I missed Sylvester until Miao-Yin moved in. She&#8217;s definitely not the same cat (Miao-Yin is MUCH more laid back than Sylvester was at 8 years of age), but the memories still come back. I suppose this will be good therapy for loss never truly accepted.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s good therapy in general. It&#8217;s been proven (though for the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember by whom or where that study is) that even just staring at a sleeping cat reduces stress. Miao-Yin sleeps a lot. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been this relaxed in a long time&#8230;<br />
There is only one itty bitty problem with having a cat. It&#8217;s a no-no in our lease. Dunno what the punishment is, but if it&#8217;s like people I knew back in Vancouver, we could face eviction. But I&#8217;m not too worried &#8212; Miao-Yin&#8217;s pretty quiet, doesn&#8217;t smell, and doesn&#8217;t try to run out the door when we open it. Chris&#8217; argument is that the building is supposed to be smoke-free, yet we smell cigarette (and marijuana) smoke all the time. Dunno if that argument would fly, but should it ever come about, we&#8217;ll give it a whirl. Frankly, I don&#8217;t see the problem with cat anyway &#8212; she&#8217;s litter trained, and doesn&#8217;t even claw the furniture (which would probably make it look better, admittedly).<br />
I suppose it could be worse, though &#8212; Chris could have adopted a pot-belly pig.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been one of those years. I really hope I don&#8217;t have to go through another one like that again. Clichéd though it be, it was a year for rediscovery &#8212; mostly of myself. I lost my self-identity in Vancouver, allowing myself to be overwhelmed by another. It takes a while to rebuild that sort of thing. It&#8217;s not done yet, but having gone through that I know now what to avoid should I ever be so stupid as to get myself into that situation again&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I didn&#8217;t think it was possible for 10 days to go by so fast&#8230;<br />
Having missed Christmas at home last year (for reasons I don&#8217;t think I need to go into), I decided a month or so ago to return home and experience Christmas the way it was meant to be experienced &#8212; with too much food, long waits at airports, problems finding the right gifts, and complaining about traffic on the QEW.<br />
Chris and I made the trip home together, leaving Calgary on 20 December. Hearing that the airport had been pretty busy the day before, and that line-ups at Air Canada&#8217;s check-in were often length, I suggested that we head to the airport a bit early (our flight was for 5:15 that afternoon). Our taxi picked us up at about 2:20, and dropped us off at the airport around 2:50. We were at the check-in by 3:00, and all ready to go by 3:05.<br />
For a flight that wouldn&#8217;t leave until 7:00 that night. Lousy delays.<br />
Chris and I spent an enlightened four hours at the airport, discussing many topics (including theology, architecture, physics, literature, and whether or not we&#8217;d be seated with any attractive single women on our flight) and reading. At least it was in Calgary airport, and not in the plane on the tarmac (which I went through in &#8217;98, and wasn&#8217;t too keen on reliving).<br />
Turned out that the plane had hydraulic problems prior to leaving Toronto. Air Canada, in it&#8217;s infinite wisdom, opted to fix the plane &#8230; and not replace it with a working aircraft, thus screwing up schedules (and probably cancelling a flight or two). We didn&#8217;t get into Toronto until 1:30.<br />
Chris and I went shopping the following day, not having brought any gifts with us from Calgary (it was extra bulk we didn&#8217;t want to have to deal with). Chris and I were in generous moods, having both received healthy Christmas bonuses from Critical Mass for all our hard work and diligence &#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s hard keeping a straight face writing stuff like that.<br />
On the 23rd, I headed out to Port Credit to meet with an old friend of mine, Kim. She was a classmate of mine from university (we suffered through possibly the worst technical writing class ever devised &#8212; I&#8217;m certain we students could have instructed that course better than the professor). She and I have gone through similar relationship hells over the past year, and have discussed our horror stories at length over email. It was the first time in about four or five years that I would see her.<br />
Despite a short wait at the train station, we finally met again, although the meeting was a tad awkward &#8212; Kim had let her hair return to it&#8217;s natural brown colour, and I had cut my rather lengthy hair and shaved. Then came the next surprise &#8212; Kim&#8217;s friend Laura. Kim was visiting Laura and her husband Ray, who were gracious enough to put up with me for the afternoon. The surprise came when I climbed into the back seat to meet her mysterious friend, only to realize that I&#8217;d had classes with Laura in university. [Insert music to &#8220;It&#8217;s A Small, Small World&#8221; here.] That pretty much set the stage for an afternoon of pseudo-reminiscing and tech talk (with Ray &#8212; I believe Kim and Laura described it as &#8220;getting along like a house on fire&#8221;).<br />
Laura and Ray were heading off to Stratford for Christmas, so Kim and I ducked out to the GO Station for the trip into Toronto (Kim was going home, I was meeting Chris and friends for dinner and a movie). We continued our talk during the trip. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little uncomfortable, though I honestly don&#8217;t know why. It might have been the gap in time between the last time that I saw her, or I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about next.<br />
Email conversations are so much easier&#8230;<br />
Kim and I parted ways at Union Station, as she had to catch the TTC home. I continued my wanderings in the PATH (Toronto&#8217;s underground mall-cum-labyrinth) and actually managed to find my way to the Eaton Centre without getting lost, taking a wrong turn, or even consulting a map. (No, I have no idea how I pulled that off.)<br />
Still having an hour or so before meeting up with Chris, I completed the last of my Christmas shopping. Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; Christmas shopping at the Eaton Centre at Christmas, I must be insane? Well, if you&#8217;re asking that question, it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;ve forgotten who I am&#8230; That said, it actually wasn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; I expected worse.<br />
Dinner was at Rol San, a Chinese restaurant along Spadina. Chris knew the place from his life in and around Toronto (I can only assume, otherwise he somehow managed to pick the place out of the phonebook). I was the first to arrive (no real surprise there), and began to wait for the stragglers. Chris had already told me (via voicemail) that he would be late (no real surprise there, although in due honesty, it wasn&#8217;t his fault), and that while I could look out for his friend Ellison (whom I&#8217;d never met before), he didn&#8217;t know what her hair colour would be at the time.<br />
Ellison, it seems, is no dummy. A &#8220;lonely-looking single guy sitting at a table for eight&#8221; is a dead give-away, and it took Ellison about two seconds to figure out who I was. We engaged in a long discussion about movies (Ellison is a film geek, and went through the same film program Chris took at Sheridan College) and living in Toronto vs. living in Calgary. About 45 minutes after Ellison, Chris and Natalie (whom I did know) appeared, followed shortly thereafter by Koto, one of Chris&#8217; co-workers from the Japan Foundation.<br />
The movie that night was &#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221;. For those of you who have been living under a rock, this is possibly the single most critically acclaimed movie of the year (I haven&#8217;t heard or read a single negative word about it). It&#8217;s likely going to be an Oscar pick (it&#8217;s already been nominated for a few Golden Globes), and rightly so &#8212; it&#8217;s got an excellent story, an excellent cast, excellent music &#8230; in short, it&#8217;s excellent. Okay, there, I&#8217;ve raved about it. Now go see it (if you haven&#8217;t already) &#8212; you can thank me later.<br />
It was the first Christmas at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s house, and it probably won&#8217;t be the last. Cathy played Santa, handing out the various gifts to those seated around. I won&#8217;t go into detail of the list (unlike last year), but I will say that I was exceptionally happy with my gifts &#8212; especially those I gave. There&#8217;s nothing like the look of surprise and joy in someone else&#8217;s face.<br />
Dinner that night was an affair not soon forgotten. Harking back to the days when my family hosted dinners having an average of 15 people in attendance, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson joined us for our meal. Yes, that is only seven people, but I wasn&#8217;t referring to the number of people &#8212; I was referring to the noise level.<br />
Cathy and Craig received &#8220;The All Canadian Trivia Game&#8221; for Christmas, and the questions became our after dinner entertainment. Being the only remotely sober person, I played Quiz Master. I was surprised at the number of times my dad answered questions that were about people and places I&#8217;d never heard of before &#8212; and I (used to) pride myself on knowing a lot of Canadiana. In fact, I found through this game that I don&#8217;t know as much as I thought I did. [Insert sound of ego deflating here.]<br />
I avoided boxing day sales at all costs &#8212; the last thing I needed was more stuff to take home with me. Instead, I spent my time eating leftovers, relaxing, watching movies, and installing my mother&#8217;s new scanner. I had hoped it would be an easy install. I really should know better by now &#8212; it took me a tech support call to UMAX to learn that I couldn&#8217;t plug the scanner into a powerbar, it needs to be plugged into the wall directly. The answer came so quickly I was surprised they didn&#8217;t have that sort of thing in the user&#8217;s guide&#8230;<br />
I also visited with another old friend (and former roommate), Ed. I met up with him and two of his friends (one of whom I knew from university) at Sega City out in Mississauga. We spent about an hour or so plugging away at the various games before we ran out of money. It was a good thing, too &#8212; the number of kids was rising at an exponential rate, and it was becoming a little too crowded for us old folks. We retreated to Jack Astor&#8217;s for beers and nachos&#8230;<br />
Next thing I knew, it was 30 December. Time to go home &#8230; Calgary, that is.<br />
Chris&#8217; parents picked me up just after 4:00 for our 7:30 flight. Yes, I know that&#8217;s early. The problem was that it had been snowing all day, and Toronto is (or at least used to be) notorious for bad traffic during that kind of weather. Figures &#8212; it was smooth driving all the way to the airport.<br />
Oh yeah, and those long line-ups I&#8217;d planned for? Non-existent. 10-minute check-in. Two hour wait for the flight. Which, of course, was delayed. (The plane we were supposed to get went out of service, probably due to a hydraulic problem, and we had to wait for another 767 to come in from Miami &#8212; it was already in transit &#8212; before we could go anywhere.) Once we&#8217;d gone through de-icing and taxiing, we&#8217;d waited for about four hours.<br />
Calgary was a zoo when we finally got in, just before midnight local time. Luggage took forever to appear, taxis were hard to get, and then to top it all off, the Calgary Police closed off Barlow Trail southbound (effectively the same as blocking off the 427 just south of the airport) for no apparent reason. After all that had happened, I just wanted to go home.<br />
We began the last day of the second millennium AD with dim sum at our favourite restaurant, followed by our ritual visit to A&amp;B Sound. We had several options on how to celebrate the turning of the year, but we settled on a video game and movie session with two friends from work. Unless the world ends tonight (little chance of that), I&#8217;ll be following up this with my annual year in review&#8230;<br />
Happy new millennium. I hope it&#8217;s better than the last one&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a weird week. Imagine trying to do &#8220;business as usual&#8221; knowing full well that in a week you&#8217;d be working out of a new office. That&#8217;s pretty much what last week was like.<br />
Critical Mass is big. As of next week, we&#8217;ll have 252 people &#8230; in Calgary. That doesn&#8217;t count the Chicago, New York, or Stockholm offices. (We&#8217;ll be even bigger once we open the Toronto office. That actually scares some people.) We ran out of space in our old building a long time ago &#8212; it was almost to the point where we would have to start stacking desks just to get everyone in.<br />
So many moons ago, our Operations Manager starting hunting for a new space. That&#8217;s not easy in Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of office space around, but it&#8217;s either occupied or WAY too dull for a &#8220;leading edge interactive marketing agency&#8221;, which I think is how we describe ourselves.<br />
The search went on for months before (somehow) we started negotiations with Mogens Smed, one of the leading interior designers for office spaces. Funky furniture, comfy chairs, and nothing that would be considered really &#8220;corporate&#8221;. It&#8217;s kinda like a step up from IKEA furniture, which is what we had. (Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with IKEA).<br />
Smed bought a building just north of the Stampede grounds that had been abandoned for many years. With Critical Mass providing direction (as we were to be the sole occupants), Smed transformed the old Pilkington Glass Company factory into the World Headquarters for Critical Mass.<br />
In six months.<br />
Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed they pulled it off. As Ted (our Chairman) remarked during today&#8217;s &#8220;tour&#8221;, it was an 18-month job done in a third of the time. But you wouldn&#8217;t know to look around. It&#8217;s a quality job. It&#8217;s also a bit getting used to &#8212; everything&#8217;s so &#8230; new. And unused. Kinda like a Star Trek episode&#8230;<br />
The trick, of course, was to get us from our old building and settled into our new building in as little time as possible. That was what happened during the weekend. With a significant amount of prep work by our administration staff, we packed and labelled every single last item in the office, right down to the spare paper clips, before Friday. On Friday morning, everyone came in, packed up their desks into plastic bins, wrapped up their computers, and left by about 9:30am. After that, it was all up to the movers.<br />
We came in around 2:00 in the afternoon on Sunday, on a directive from Ted, to unpack our bins and set up our desks. Aside from a few small things, everything arrived intact an unharmed. Even more shocking was when I got in this morning &#8212; except for our LDAP server, we were up and running. All the phones, the mail server, the Internet connection &#8212; everything. It was all up. Mind you, it wasn&#8217;t without its glitches, but when you consider that the office was moved in a weekend to a new location, and it all works, well &#8230; that&#8217;s a pretty amazing feat.<br />
We have a really interesting deal with Smed. They own the building, and all the furniture inside. We own the computers. We get a really cool office (for a lot less than we should), and Smed gets a really cool company to occupy the space. Smed gets to drag in companies like Coca-Cola to show them what a cool space looks like, and if we happen to pitch a website to them at the same time, well, that&#8217;s business.<br />
Hollywood scripts aren&#8217;t planned this well. (Especially this year&#8230;)<br />
With slightly over two weeks left before I duck out for Ontario for Christmas, the next couple of weeks are going to be really hectic.<br />
But at least I can go insane in a cool building&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About nine months ago, I arrived in Calgary without really too much of a clue of what I was going to do next. For most people, I guess it would be quite stressful (one person comes immediately to mind, though I try not to think about her). It gave me a strange feeling of freedom. For what seemed like the first time in my life, I was free to do as I chose, and it wouldn&#8217;t affect anyone else but me.<br />
A day after I arrived, Chris sent me a reply to the mass message I&#8217;d sent out. It was the start of what we thought would be a grand adventure to Japan. In fact, we&#8217;d coordinated a lot of things to bring Chris here, to get an apartment that suited us both, get us both jobs, and so on and so on, all under the guise that in just over a year, we&#8217;d be heading out to Japan to teach English. Friday 24 November 2000 was the deadline for submitting our applications to JET, the organisation we wanted to go with.<br />
Not long after Chris had arrived here, the two of us were wandering around Calgary, discussing whatever we felt like discussing. (Admittedly, it was usually movies, computers, TV, and/or women, though not necessarily in that order.) Chris said something that surprised me a little. Although I can&#8217;t remember his exact words, he said that there was no way to predict the future, and it was entirely possible that things might change, and we not go.<br />
Well, the deadline has come and gone. And we&#8217;re not going. At least not right now. I&#8217;m not sure what exact processes drove Chris to not submit his application, I know what happened to me.<br />
Complacency.<br />
I&#8217;ll be the first to admit I&#8217;m comfortable. I like my job (although there are a few egos around here I&#8217;d love to deflate), I like our apartment, I like this city, and I like my roommate (that&#8217;s a given, I guess). Humanity, in general, doesn&#8217;t like change. It likes status quo, particularly if it&#8217;s a comfy status quo. Personally, my status quo is a big, warm blanket in front of a roaring fire with a cup of Callebaut hot chocolate.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that I didn&#8217;t want to go. I still do &#8212; there&#8217;s adventure to be had! But at the same time, I no longer felt the need to do something &#8220;radical&#8221;. Had I been able to apply and go within a month or so after arriving, I&#8217;d have gone &#8212; no questions asked. Heck, I probably still would have gone after only a couple of months here. Now? Well, I feel like a replanted tree that&#8217;s had a few months to spread roots. It&#8217;s not impossible to up and leave (I&#8217;ve done it before), but I don&#8217;t have that driving force anymore.<br />
So what happened to Chris? He ran into some problems like mine (it&#8217;s tricky getting the right references, and ours didn&#8217;t come in quickly enough), but he had other reasons, too. (Reasons I&#8217;m not allowed to elaborate on &#8212; so don&#8217;t ask.)<br />
When I missed the deadline, I feeling of tremendous guilt started to wash over me. It could have been the rhinovirus I&#8217;m currently fighting off, I suppose, but there was that hollow feeling you sometimes get when you know you&#8217;ve let someone down. So imagine my surprise when Chris told me he hadn&#8217;t applied, either. Needless to say, I started feeling a lot better &#8230; of course, that could have been the Contac-C I took.<br />
A few weeks ago, Chris and I were wandering around Calgary, discussing the usual (movies, computers, TV, and/or women &#8230; although I should point out our more recent conversations have also included existentialism) when I happened to mention my disinterest in dating. And not because I don&#8217;t want to &#8212; nine months can do a lot, not to mention patch up holes in one&#8217;s soul &#8212; it was because I didn&#8217;t want to hurt anyone when it came time to leave for Japan. Chris had a good point of view on that:<br />
&#8220;Life is what happens between now and your plans. Don&#8217;t stop living for the sake of the future.&#8221;<br />
I swear Chris should write one of those bathroom books. He&#8217;s just full of this stuff.<br />
At any rate, that got me to thinking. Living. That&#8217;s something I hadn&#8217;t done in a while. He had a point &#8212; I was holding myself back for the sake of something vague. So I did the only thing I could do: I went on a date.<br />
Yes, with a member of the opposite sex! (Sheesh&#8230;)<br />
This was Wednesday 8 November. I won&#8217;t tell you her name, but she works here as one of our Art Directors. Wonderful woman &#8230; who was interested in someone else. Of course, I didn&#8217;t know that at the time, but I found out shortly after. Although my sources on the design floor are good, they missed the potential love triangle subplot. I decided it was better to cut my losses before I did something stupid. Probably for the best, too &#8212; I tend to work with her a lot, and I&#8217;d prefer to avoid making things uncomfortable for the both of us.<br />
I won&#8217;t be likely having any more personal escapades for the next few weeks, though. A project I should have started last week finally starts tomorrow. With the same deadline. Yeah, that means longer hours. Whee. And that&#8217;s not counting the company moving to a new building on Friday. (We&#8217;ve been told they&#8217;re be no downtime &#8230; I&#8217;ll believe that when I log in at 8:00 the following Monday morning.) And that&#8217;s still not counting my various research projects and task forces, and updates to the half-a-dozen sites I&#8217;m responsible for.<br />
I love my job. (Can&#8217;t you tell, I&#8217;m here on a Sunday!)<br />
And with that, I&#8217;m heading home. I&#8217;m tired, I&#8217;m hungry, and I&#8217;m still sick.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Things have been pretty quiet since the summer &#8212; not a lot of activity, not a heck of a lot to report. But this is a habit I&#8217;ve gotta keep up, if for nothing else so that I&#8217;ll be in practice if/when this Japan thing pans out. Although admittedly, I&#8217;ll probably have much more to talk about then.<br />
Our weekend more-or-less began at 12:45pm on Thursday. That was when we heard: &#8220;Anyone who can hear this, get your butts over the Danish Community Hall now!&#8221; That was the call for our &#8220;Town Hall Meeting&#8221;, a gathering of the Calgary office in one place. Once upon a time (before I started), we could actually congregate in one place in the office. Doesn&#8217;t happen anymore &#8212; we have to go across the street to the DCH so we can hear the speeches.<br />
We hold these about every six months. It&#8217;s mostly so everyone can have an inkling of what&#8217;s going on. (We&#8217;ve got a lot of people spread across a lot of projects &#8212; there&#8217;s no way for everyone to know everything. That&#8217;s not to say, of course, that I don&#8217;t try.) All 250-odd people crammed into the Valhalla Hall for four hours of cheesy speeches, reviews on our projects, really dull organizational ponderings, and an auction.<br />
Yes, an auction. Ted, one of our founders and the company Chairman (Chairperson, whatever!) and the other members of the senior management auctioned off a gourmet meal for 12 people. It&#8217;s a fundraiser (believe it or not) for charity. They wine and dine you, you fork out a lot of money, which when combined with money from Critical Mass (the company), goes towards sending underprivileged to camp in Westbank. (Ted&#8217;s got a thing for Westbank&#8230;) Many people got together in groups of 12 to try and bid for the prize. I say &#8220;try&#8221; because within only a minute or so, the price surpassed anything we grunts could afford &#8212; it was a battle between our CTO and our Director of Project Management. When the dust settled, Ted said the dinner was now for 24, and took both groups. All told, about $22,000 is going to kids. Not bad for five minutes&#8217; work, eh?<br />
The meeting over, we were instructed to attending a post-Town Hall reception at Ceili&#8217;s (it&#8217;s Gaelic, so you pronounce it &#8220;Cayley&#8217;s&#8221;) &#8212; a pub a couple blocks away. By 8pm, the only sober person was Chris. Everyone else was quite inebriated. Luckily for us, Ted had told us we didn&#8217;t have to come in at our regular time (8am) the following morning. This was good. Most people didn&#8217;t show up until 10am. A few didn&#8217;t straggle in until 2pm &#8212; they didn&#8217;t look so good.<br />
Friday night, we met with up with Therese and Stuart (who were somewhat fresh from their trip to Vancouver &#8212; they must&#8217;ve really enjoyed themselves, we&#8217;ve heard much of their escapades; I&#8217;ve listened intently, and been able to picture exactly where they&#8217;ve been and how it looks &#8212; I have to admit that I still miss it) to see &#8220;Pay It Forward&#8221;, one of the better movies this year. Haley Joel Osmet (the kid) is one of these once-in-a-lifetime wunderkinds who either go onto huge success or burn out trying. I sincerely hope it&#8217;s more the former than the latter&#8230;<br />
On Saturday, I had the pleasure of keeping an eye on my little cousin, Jen. Hmm&#8230; &#8220;Little&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good word. Let&#8217;s go with &#8220;younger&#8221;. Jen&#8217;s 16 years younger than me. She&#8217;s less than an inch shorter than me. Notice a problem with this? For some reason that I&#8217;ll never understand, the Western side of my family seems to have mutant children that grow to huge heights. Must be the water.<br />
Deciding that I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having her trounce all over me on her N64 all evening, I suggested that I take her to a movie. At first, she wasn&#8217;t too keen, but when I suggested playing video games before the movie, she ran for her coat. The movie was &#8220;The Little Vampire&#8221;. It&#8217;s a cute little movie, though I wasn&#8217;t sure how Jen would respond to it. She&#8217;s at that &#8220;pre-teenager&#8221; stage where kid things are no longer cool, but I&#8217;m not comfortable with dragging her into most of the other movies currently out (although she&#8217;s seen &#8220;Meet The Parents&#8221; and loved it).<br />
We played &#8220;Gauntlet&#8221; (the new version &#8212; Jen&#8217;s too young to remember the original) for two hours. Straight. We hurt afterwards&#8230;<br />
Sunday started with dim sum. It&#8217;s almost a ritual for Chris and I &#8212; one more week, and we&#8217;ll have a set pattern that&#8217;ll be hard to break. However, we&#8217;ve run into one itty bitty problem with it &#8212; the line-up seems to be getting bigger every week. Dunno why &#8212; it was fine up until two weeks ago. We need to start going earlier. Stuart and Therese were a bit surprised at the line-up, too, and they&#8217;ve been to Silver Dragon far more often than Chris and I.<br />
The best part about weekends is having no plans. So when Therese suggested we go &#8220;window shopping&#8221;, we eagerly piled into Stuart and Therese&#8217;s new Volkswagen Jetta (complete with possibly the best-sounding stereo I&#8217;ve ever heard in a car) and drove south to Chinook Mall. There, Chris proceeded to attempt to buy something from every store. Of course, that&#8217;s an exaggeration &#8212; he&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230; Therese and I somehow managed to make it out of the mall unscathed, financially-speaking, that is. Chris won the award for most stuff, and for most unusual &#8212; a replica of the old vinyl airline bags of the &#8217;60s. Why? Dunno. It&#8217;s a Chris thing&#8230;<br />
Speaking of airlines, Chris and I will be returning to the wilds of Ontario for Christmas this year, on (or around) the 20th. Tickets have been booked and paid for, so there&#8217;s no holding us back. Unless somebody chains the plane to the ground, that is&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Old hobbies die hard. Have keyboard, will write. Love four word sentences.<br />
A lot of you &#8230; some of you &#8230; at least ONE of you asked why I didn&#8217;t send a log about Thanksgiving. No particular reason, I just didn&#8217;t write one. It wasn&#8217;t blasé by any means &#8212; Chris and I enjoyed two excellent turkey dinners courtesy of Therese and Stuart, and my Aunt and Uncle. Chris supplied the dessert at Stuart and Therese&#8217;s, a pumpkin mousse. (He felt the traditional pumpkin pie was too traditional.) We had pumpkin pie the following night.<br />
Life in Calgary has been quietening down a bit. (Not that it&#8217;s been furiously active since my killer workload dissipated.) Lately, I&#8217;ve been keeping my pastimes to a Thoreauvian level: Working, eating, sleeping, watching TV, watching movies, reading, and writing. Sounds pretty spartan, I know, but like Thoreau said: &#8220;Simplify, simplify, simplify.&#8221; It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m dating or anything&#8230;<br />
When I left university and started working full-time as a technical writer (cum Geoff-of-all-trades), I slowly stopped one of my favourite hobbies: writing. Not this kind of writing, which is very stream-of-consciousness matter-of-fact writing, but fiction (science, or otherwise). When I was in high school, I wrote a large number of short stories (partially because I was in a creative writing class), but also because of my friends &#8212; Chris, in particular.<br />
Chris is a creative person, has been for as long as I&#8217;ve known him. He&#8217;s a very visual person, which is one of the reasons he&#8217;s drawn to the visual arts far more than I (I can barely draw a stick person). But in high school, he translated many of those visual ideas to paper. While the stories I wrote were maybe somewhat fantastical, Chris has a unique ability to write horrific stories that were reminiscent of Stephen King and Clive Barker. (Given the genre he typically read, that&#8217;s not all that surprising.) I used Chris as my benchmark to shoot for when trying to improve my writing.<br />
When I hit university, I continued to write, though not nearly as frequently. When I was on my co-op terms at Digital Equipment, I had the ability to go home at night and write &#8212; my job didn&#8217;t dampen my creativeness. It wasn&#8217;t until I started working as a technical writer that things started to go sour, story-speaking.<br />
I can&#8217;t believe to this day how much energy got sucked up when writing a technical document of some sort. So much that when I actually tried to sit down and write something vaguely interesting, I ended up writing more about the software package I was documenting. Not really a good creative streak, in my opinion. It wasn&#8217;t long before that entire creative streak was gone. It was a sad day when I stared at a blank screen in Word, unable to write a single word, unable to think a single creative thought.<br />
That&#8217;s one of the reasons I started writing these. I don&#8217;t have to think much. (You can all stop laughing now.) But it allows me to get the need to write out of my system, otherwise I&#8217;d probably go crazy. (For the record, I also wrote these because if there&#8217;s one thing I hate, it&#8217;s losing friends due to lack of communication. I do think about all my friends (and family, obviously) and how you&#8217;ve affected my life. I may not ask you how you&#8217;re doing on a regular basis, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t wonder.<br />
About a month ago, I lay in bed trying to sleep while a wind tore through downtown Calgary. Normally, this is just a mildly annoying thing &#8212; the rattling of the windows just keeps you from falling asleep as quickly as you might normally. But that night, it rattled loose an old memory &#8230; part of a short story I&#8217;d written in university. I thought about it for a while, falling asleep wondering what it would be like to write it out again.<br />
I don&#8217;t have any of the short stories I wrote in high school and university. They fell a horrible virtual death during a computer maintenance session in 1998. The only things that survived were the Observer&#8217;s Logs I&#8217;d written from a few years earlier. (Although I mourned the loss of the work, I was happy that my logs survived.) I had nothing to start on, except the memory of what I&#8217;d done.<br />
For the next few days, the ideas I&#8217;d had for the story, including the comments my English 409 professor had given me, came trickling back like creek refilling during a spring thaw. Finally, dragged out my old Gateway Pentium 133 laptop (really only good now for using Microsoft Office) and started writing.<br />
The more I wrote, the higher the temperature got. The melt continued, and the trickle became a strong stream. I actually had to go out and buy a small notepad and pen so I can jot down ideas. I carry it with me everywhere now, just in case. Every night for the past couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve sat down in front of my computer, and wrote. Not copious amounts (I need to drag myself away from the TV &#8212; it&#8217;s wrecking my concentration), but I&#8217;m up to about 30 pages of a novel.<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m past the short story phase (at least for this particular tale). The (nearly) three years of writing Observer&#8217;s Log entries (in often disgusting detail, as several people have complained) have given me the ability to dwell on a particular scene or character and develop an aspect of the story. I don&#8217;t know how long this book will be &#8212; it&#8217;s writing itself at the moment &#8212; but hopefully I can find someone to publish it.<br />
Anyone know of a good literary agent?</p>

		<p>I love Calgary.<br />
Last night, still technically summer according to our seasonal rotation, it snowed.<br />
Yes, frozen precipitation. It was still there this morning. It wasn&#8217;t much, barely a centimetre in places, but enough to notice that it was there.<br />
Enough to annoy Chris, though.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen snow this early in my life (though apparently it&#8217;s not unusual to see snow in June here), which is a stark contrast to my life in Vancouver, where it was rare to see snow at all. (The common phrase I heard was &#8220;leave the snow on the mountains, where it belongs&#8221;.) The snow will melt before I go out for lunch today, but that&#8217;s not the point. Snow in summer. That&#8217;s something to write home about.<br />
The trees here have only recently started to turn their autumn shades. Mostly yellows here &#8212; I&#8217;m told there isn&#8217;t a lot of red (very few maple trees). With the snowfall, I suspect the colours shall turn at a slight more accelerated rate.<br />
Now if the building management would just turn the frickin&#8217; hot water on in our radiators&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Whirlwind weekends. Gotta love &#8217;em&#8230;<br />
This weekend, as some of you already know, I was in Toronto. One of my friends, Jay, was getting married to his girlfriend of six years, and I was fortunate enough to witness this happy day. (More on that in a moment.)<br />
I left Friday afternoon, cutting out an hour early from work to catch the flight. It was the first time in I don&#8217;t know how long that I&#8217;d flown Air Canada, and I was a bit apprehensive. Air Canada has had a bad rap, from me at least, with their ability to process customers with any speed. They&#8217;ve changed recently, oddly enough since their merger with Canadian Airlines, and it&#8217;s been for the better. They now feature faster lines, even electronic check-in (more on that later), and people who actually smile at you. It&#8217;s a nice change.<br />
The flight out left at 6:00pm. I was in 13F &#8212; second row back from first class, inside aisle seat, starboard side. Right next to an early 20s Korean woman with her six month old child. Yeah, those chills of listening to a baby crying for four hours were firing up my spine within seconds of sitting down. It seems that my good friend Murphy missed the flight, however, the baby merely whined a little on the way up and on the way down. Cute kid.<br />
Too cute.<br />
In fact, I started thinking about having kids again. It&#8217;s been a long time since I last thought about it, even so much as devoting a passing wonder. During the flight, I started to think about all the people I knew with babies, and how I&#8217;m not one of them. I&#8217;m not exactly getting any younger, nor are my parents or my grandmother. I would like my child to know its grandparents &#8212; both of them, and its great-grandmother. I never knew either of my grandfathers &#8212; both died long before I was born. I had a step-grandfather, but I saw him only a handful of times over 24 years before he died. My lasting memory of Papa was him teaching me to skip stones on the beach in Waskesiu.<br />
So I got to thinking. What would it be like to have a child? Well, not give birth to one, but care for a child (or two), and raise it (or them) to adulthood. It&#8217;s one of those things we non-parents can only guess at, having never gone through the process. We can get hints from those who are parents, but we&#8217;ll never really know &#8212; until we&#8217;re parents.<br />
My previous few flights on Canadian Airlines led me to believe that the Canadian airline industry was going slightly downhill. I was quite happy to find, however, that Air Canada was not affected the same way. Great service, good movies (&#8220;Keeping the Faith&#8221; on the way out, &#8220;U-571&#8221; on the way back) great food (yes, I said &#8220;great&#8221; &#8212; airline food can be good, y&#8217;know), and comfortable seats. Yeah, comfortable seats sounds dumb, but if you fly enough you come to appreciate nice seats.<br />
We touched down at 11:30 EDT, arriving at the terminal some 20 minutes later. (I keep forgetting just how big Pearson International is). It was the first time in more years than I can remember that I used Terminal 2. For years, I&#8217;ve been flying out of either Terminal 1 or 3, depending on the flight. But because I avoided Air Canada, I never went into Terminal 2. It was so long that I didn&#8217;t recognize the interior at all. Well, except the baggage claim area, though I only sprinted through that &#8212; I had only carry-ons.<br />
Cathy was there to pick me up, circling the outside looking for me. (She wasn&#8217;t able to park.) Soon we were back in Oakville. We didn&#8217;t stay up long &#8212; I had to be up early for the wedding (starting at 11:00am) and Cathy was tired. So we chatted a short while before both retreating to bed.<br />
The next morning, I showered, shaved, dressed, and gathered myself for a long wedding day. (Not nearly as long as the bride and groom, but hey &#8212; I had jet lag to contend with.) This included a quick trip to my parents&#8217; house (I was staying at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s; my parents are somewhere in either Colorado or Utah &#8212; we don&#8217;t know which) to iron my shirt and borrow a pair of my dad&#8217;s dress shoes.<br />
The dress shoes were the worst part. I accidentally left my pair in Vancouver. I liked them &#8212; they were reasonably comfy. But I&#8217;m not about to go after them. That would be like reaching into a hive of African bees to get a dime. In lieu of buying a pair, my dad (who, along with my mother, were out here for a couple of weeks during their most recent excursion of the continent) suggested I borrow his.<br />
Now, my dad and I do not share bodily proportions. I&#8217;m shorter than him, by about six inches or so, and I&#8217;ve got smaller feet. A lot smaller. About a size and a half. It took five tissues per shoe and an insole to keep my feet from swimming around. They were uncomfortable and too big, but at least I didn&#8217;t attend the wedding wearing my ubiquitous sandals.<br />
Borrowing my mother&#8217;s van, I took the long route getting to the church. I wanted to be early, but I was a little too early. So I drove around to see what had changed since the last time I&#8217;d really paid attention to where I was going.<br />
I arrived about 20 minutes before the service was to begin, and already there were a large number of cars. Jay was at the front door greeting people as they arrived. Jay always has a permanent smile &#8212; he&#8217;s always happy about something. Especially when he&#8217;s trashing talking someone. But his smile was even broader than normal. He looked nearly ecstatic. He looked like a kid on Christmas morning, staring at a gigantic pile of presents under a tree.<br />
Just beyond Jay were his ushers, two of whom I knew: Stuart and Nabil. Stuart you all know, or at least have heard of. Nabil is &#8230; well, unless you&#8217;ve met him, you&#8217;re never going to understand. I might write a lot, but I can&#8217;t script a character like Nabil. Needless to say, seeing him in a tux was worth the $560 airplane ticket.<br />
I hung around the foyer a while until Matt and Alicia (I hope I got the spelling right) showed up after a few minutes. I knew them through Stuart and Jay (I met Jay through Stuart). The three of us took seats on the groom&#8217;s side four rows back from the front. It was a good thing we were there &#8212; the Corinne&#8217;s side of the church heavily outweighed Jay&#8217;s side, and most of them were family. Jay&#8217;s side seemed mostly friends, with a scattering of family for flavour.<br />
The music changed, and Jay walked down the aisle with his brother, his Best Man. Then the groomsmen came up the groom&#8217;s side, followed by the bridesmaids on the bride&#8217;s side. If Jay looked happy before, he looked like he was going to die from joy now. If his smile had gotten any wider, it would have split his head open. I looked down the aisle to see where Corrine was &#8212; her expression wasn&#8217;t much different &#8212; she was happier than I&#8217;d ever seen her.<br />
And that&#8217;s when it hit me.<br />
As you all know, I was to be married. For me, it wasn&#8217;t a joy &#8212; it was a death sentence. It was utter torture to organize, especially considering that I really didn&#8217;t want to go through with it. That, added to my pre-existing view of weddings as being an overly-extravagant ceremony wrapped around a lot of paperwork, really didn&#8217;t seed the flower of joy in weddings.<br />
Jay and Corinne changed that. Over the course of the day, I would come realize that while some people, like me, aren&#8217;t really huge fans of weddings, there are those for whom weddings are the happiest and most important day in their lives. It&#8217;s when they can say to everyone they&#8217;ve known and loved that they have found the person with whom they will spend their lives, feed, protect, covet, love, and share every moment. There is no fear, there is only happiness.<br />
I&#8217;ve only seen this kind of thing in movies. So it was a strange feeling to be watching it myself. I even found myself succumbing to the beauty in it &#8212; I actually found my eyes becoming a tad blurry. Partially from happiness, knowing that such a wonderful thing can exist, and partially from sadness, an empty feeling I periodically get when I wonder if I&#8217;ll ever be that lucky. I&#8217;m envious of such joy.<br />
I&#8217;ve known a lot of relationships in my time, and I&#8217;ve seen a lot fall apart. There are some, however, that will live (and love) a long time. Jay and Corinne are one such couple. Seeing them without smiles on their faces was (and will likely be) a rarity.<br />
Corinne&#8217;s family is Italian. Jay&#8217;s family is Irish and Italian. Hence, the wedding was Italian. Hence, Catholic. Hence, a lot of standing, sitting, kneeling, and trying not to get lost in all the activity. Matt, Alicia, and I did our best to try and keep up with everything. Stuart had a much better system: Stand when told, otherwise sit.<br />
After the wedding, we went through the receiving line, wishing the newlyweds all the best. Jay and Corinne still sported their massive smiles, which they would hold all day. I warned them that if they kept smiling like that, they&#8217;d never be able to stop.<br />
I waited outside with Stuart, Nabil, Matt, Alicia, and some of the other groomsmen, waiting for the receiving line to die out a bit. Mostly, I was waiting for Brenda and Marek to appear. They were co-workers when I was at Arkipelago in Toronto. They were my friends, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen in nearly a year. I can safely say that I miss the both of them.<br />
Soon, six of us (Brenda, Marek, Brant (another ex-Arkipelago employee, who started after me, whom I only knew by name), Matt, Alicia, and myself) broke for lunch. None of us had eaten breakfast, and the concept of going all day without food was not appealing.<br />
On a suggestion from Marek, we all went to the Dundas Street Grill, on Dundas around Kipling. We ate too much. We were still hungry, but we ate too much. We knew that there was going to be a bombardment of food at the reception, and it dawned on me (and certainly the others) that we were going to look like we&#8217;d been to taxidermists after the reception that evening.<br />
After lunch, we broke into two squads: Marek, Brenda, and Brant went off in search of fortune and glory, while Matt, Alicia, and I tried to navigate all the detours and closed exits to get to a lone two-bedroom apartment in High Park. There we hung out for the remainder of time until we had to go to the reception. Alicia and I watched &#8220;Leon&#8221; (aka &#8220;The Professional&#8221;) while Matt napped &#8212; he and Nabil had been out drinking until 4:00am the previous night.<br />
Two of Matt&#8217;s (and presumably, Jay&#8217;s) friends were going to catch a ride with us. So we waited around until they arrived. At 5:15. The reception was at 5:30. At Finch and the 427, about 30-40 kilometres away. We were there by 5:50.<br />
The reception was at a place called Pantone&#8217;s (or something like that), what some people referred to as a &#8220;wedding factory&#8221;. It&#8217;s basically a light industrial building converted into two massive reception halls, separated by (presumably) a massive kitchen. Each of the halls has a lobby where all 200+ guests were crammed in. We did another reception line, met all the wedding party as we worked our way around, got our seats, and signed our names.<br />
Marek, Brenda, Brant, and I were assigned to Table #22 &#8212; the current and ex-co-workers table. The last table. But also one of the best tables &#8212; we were right next to the bar. Given, there was a pillar in my view that blocked a bit of the head table, but I spent most of my time talking to Brant, Brenda, and Marek, and listening to Marek&#8217;s stories. (Did I mention that miss working with Brenda and Marek?)<br />
This was my first experience with an Italian wedding. Also my first with an Italian reception. Not quite a full-bore Italian reception (I&#8217;ve heard of much bigger, though Chris tells me Chinese receptions even outdo Italian receptions), but it was still bigger than all the others I&#8217;d been to.<br />
Dinner came in five courses. First was buns. Okay, they&#8217;re not a course, but we all dug into the buns before anything else. Then came the appetizer: grilled vegetables with goat cheese, olives (no, I didn&#8217;t eat the olives), and a prociutto-wrapped raw fig. The fig was a little odd (never had one), but it was still good. Round Two was the pasta: tortellini and something that looked like the pasta equivalent of a Swiss roll. Dunno what it was called, but boy, was it good. Round Three was the chicken, breaded veal, and roasted vegetables. (Marek called the veal about five minutes before it was served.) By this point, the four of us were undoing buttons and breathing lightly, so&#8217;s not to have our chests burst. Then came Round Four: seafood and salad. I refrained from the seafood, not for a lack of wanting it (except maybe the lobster), but did accept the salad. We were all dreading what culinary wonder we would have to suffer through next when a small brown sphere appeared on our plates: Tartuffe. (I think Marek called that one too, though it might have been Brant.)<br />
You don&#8217;t refuse Tartuffe &#8212; that&#8217;s just sacrilegious.<br />
The First Dance had actually been before dinner, something that was new to me. The dancing resumed after dinner with the other traditional dances: Father with daughter, mother with son, groomsmen with bridesmaids. I sat and watched it all. (Aside from the fact that I&#8217;m not a big dancer, my dad&#8217;s shoes were shredding the tops of my feet, making even sitting a chore.) Then things started getting silly.<br />
The MC (I don&#8217;t know if he was an employee of the establishment, or if Jay and Corinne hired him and the DJ) got people to do silly things. That seems to be a trend at weddings. On such silly thing was having Jay and Corinne each start &#8220;trains&#8221;. Jay went around picking up all the women, while Corinne went around picking up all the men. (I think that if I ever get married, the only thing anyone will be picking up is something more to drink.) I did not join in, as my feet were now beginning to consider a rebellion and secede from the rest of my body.<br />
The party went on until around 11:00, at which point a lot of people started to leave. Stuart and I (I was driving Stuart home) ducked out around 11:30 or so, after both of us came to the conclusion that we were too tired to go on. Jay and Corinne, however, were still going strong, and still had the massive smiles on their faces. Like I said, I&#8217;m envious of such happiness. (Although, it could have been that their faces had in fact been stuck in that position.)<br />
I awoke late the next day to the smell of bacon. (I still say that it is genetically impossible for me to sleep through the smell of cooking bacon.) Cathy and Craig were already up and about, doing whatever it is that they do on weekends. We ate a leisurely brunch &#8230; ah, heck, it was even past lunch by the time we actually ate, even if it was eggs, bacon, and hash browns. By the time I got myself up and running, it was nearly 2:00pm. Taking some time, I tried to call two friends of mine in Toronto: Kathryn and Ed. (They don&#8217;t live with each other, they don&#8217;t even know each other &#8212; but I had said I would try to get a hold of them while I was in. No, I wasn&#8217;t shunning anyone else, just that the topic that I would be in town came up in emails with them.)<br />
Couldn&#8217;t find Ed. (Ed &#8212; check your 411 entry, eh?) Kathryn took a bit, but I managed to corner her at her place in Toronto. Being occupied, I had to restrict myself to a phone call instead of a proper visit. Afterwards I called Stuart to let him know that we wouldn&#8217;t be seeing Kathryn that day. Stuart invited me to join him on his mission to return the rented tux.<br />
Square One was as busy as I remembered. It had been a very long time since the last time I&#8217;d been in Square One, but it didn&#8217;t look all that different. No further than 100 metres into the mall, we ran into Jay and Corinne. They looked a little more rested than the day before, but the smiles were still there. (I know envy&#8217;s one of the Seven Deadly Sins, but sometimes it&#8217;s just hard to ignore&#8230;)<br />
The rest of the afternoon vanished quickly. Stuart and I went in search of a Slurpee or Froster, only to find the nearest one to where our parents live in Oakville is at a Mac&#8217;s (aka Mac&#8217;s Milk) next to the old Loblaws store downtown. During our search, we found ourselves noting what stores in downtown Oakville used to be something else. (A sure sign that you&#8217;re getting old.) We were almost shocked to realize that downtown Oakville, at least along Lakeshore, isn&#8217;t much different than Banff (Bamf!).<br />
Terminal 2 has taken a few cues from Terminal 3, and Air Canada has gone long ways to try and streamline passenger check-in. One such is the introduction of Express terminals. You feed in your credit card or Aerocard, punch in your flight number, select your seat (I missed that), and bam &#8212; out comes your boarding pass. Very convenient, and really nice if all you have is carry-on. (Even if you have actual baggage, there&#8217;s an Express baggage check-in after you&#8217;ve got your boarding pass.)<br />
No aisle. I was wedged between two people. Not entirely comfortable, but at least it would get me home. It was a quiet flight &#8212; most of the people around me slept. Especially the guy on the window seat. I had a sneaky suspicion he was returning from a trip to Europe (he had brochures, maps, and bits of literature from European attractions), and was dead tired. He slept nearly the entire trip.<br />
This was not a cheap excursion for me, and I had for a while debated on not going. However, one night as I lay in bed, counting the number of streetlights reflecting on my ceiling, I made a decision. Last year, I missed the weddings of some dear friends: Ed (one of my roommates from university) and his wife Jen, and Marek and Brenda. I missed them because I was told I didn&#8217;t have enough money to afford it. (I need not mention who told that to me.) I sincerely wished I had gone. Those were days I wished I hadn&#8217;t missed. Hopefully, I won&#8217;t miss any more.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is a hard-working company. And Ted (our founder and corporate Chairman) knows it. To &#8220;thank&#8221; us for all the grief he puts us through, he closes (more or less) the office for two days, packs us off to some remote part of the country, and gets us all horribly drunk &#8212; and he pays for everything. It might be good to be king, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be a peasant every once in a while.<br />
Critical Mass starts planning &#8220;The Trip&#8221;, as it&#8217;s usually referred to, about four months early. It&#8217;s a fairly involved excursion, and when you consider the attendance (at least this year) is about 300 people, there&#8217;s a fair bit of coordination involved. We have two people who work on it nearly full-time, in addition to their regular jobs. And then there&#8217;s a team of about 10 people (representing the various departments in the company) who help in the decision making for things such as, well, the beer labels.<br />
Yes, beer labels. This was something I participated in. We had a beer label competition. If you buy enough beer from the Big Rock Brewery here in Calgary, you can make your own special labels for the event. When I first heard about the opportunity to see if I could out-design the Design department, I leapt a the chance. I came in second. Behind Adrian. A guy who works in Design. Oh well, maybe next year.<br />
We arrived at Critical Mass on Thursday morning with bags in hand, ready for the nine-odd hour trip to Westbank, British Columbia. (For those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of Westbank, it&#8217;s a little south of Kelowna, on the east side of Lake Okanagan.) Luckily, we were not taking school busses (I can only imaging the agony of sitting in those for more than three hours at a time) &#8212; were taking Greyhound.<br />
The busses started arriving around 8:00am. We were told they would arrive at 7:30am. This was a tactic to make sure we all were there on time. As it stands, the fourth (and last) bus didn&#8217;t arrive until nearly 8:45, and we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 9:00 (despite the threatened 8:30 departure time). Again, all of this was planned with an iota of experience &#8212; I assume they had problems last year, and figured it would be worse this time around.<br />
Luckily, our Greyhound busses came equipped with all the modern conveniences: Reclining seats, air conditioning, and a VCR with two TVs. That meant movies. And what better movies to travel with than the Indiana Jones trilogy? Well, if you&#8217;re Mike (on of my co-workers, and a huge fan of independent films), it also includes &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221;. Mike, it seems, was the only one really interested in it. I would have preferred to see &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#8221; instead, which was bumped when Mike beat us to the VCR.<br />
We made three stops along the way &#8212; a quick one at some rest stop, one at Golden for lunch, and a third one in some rinky-dink place north of Vernon so all the smokers on the busses wouldn&#8217;t shake it apart from nic-fits. Every time we had a stop, Pat (whom we labelled &#8220;Bus Masta P&#8221; &#8212; he was in charge of all the busses) got stressed out trying to keep everyone on schedule by getting them back on. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll willingly do that again next year.<br />
We arrived at the Cove Resort around 5:30pm PDT. Now, before you get all &#8220;oooh, a resort!&#8221;, this is at best a word that would describe the long-term plans. There&#8217;s no shuffleboard, no sailboats, no beach &#8212; not even anything remotely resembling a restaurant. It&#8217;s an old farm converted to 26 cabins and a small motel-like building. My cabin, in fact, used to be the farm house. Even all those cabins couldn&#8217;t house our bulk &#8212; we needed the large field to accommodate an additional 20 or so tents.<br />
There were no real plans that evening, aside from getting settled (which took a while &#8212; we had a lot of stuff to unload from the busses), eat (which we did, around 7:00 that evening), drink (which we did in abundance), and relax (which came after the aforementioned drinking). Many of us congregated at Cabin #6, home of the Conners Brothers and Colin &#8212; a perfect recipe for trouble, especially when four tenters were regularly crashing on the cabin floor rather than sleeping outside. Cabin #6 became legend by the following morning.<br />
I didn&#8217;t rise until nearly 1pm, opting to catch up on a lot of sleep. The day was warm and sunny, and people were milling about. I headed to the main tent, where I hoped lunch was being served (I didn&#8217;t really know what time it was, I didn&#8217;t know for most of the weekend). I was in luck &#8212; lunch was slowly beginning to end, and snatching up a meal was as simple as walking up to the table and taking whatever I wanted.<br />
The day was slow and lazy &#8212; the way a day should be. Others went off in search of amenities such as McDonald&#8217;s and Starbucks. I went off in search of things I could watch. I opted not to actually participate in anything, trying not to do anything physically active at all. (This was a conscious decision &#8230; it came right after I realized I&#8217;d forgotten my swimsuit.) There were plenty of things for me to watch &#8212; people were playing sports all over the place, including horseshoes, bocce, volleyball, soccer, and touch football.<br />
The &#8220;major&#8221; event of the day was the wakeboarding demonstration. Ted (who lives barely five minutes from the Resort) is basically a big kid, and is always looking for new toys and things to do. (This is why we also had a houseboat that would take us on short rides on the lake, and Ted took extreme pleasure in whipping people around in his new super-fast powerboat.) Ted hired professional wakeboarders (some of whom had placed as high as fifth in Wakestock, the wakeboarding championships) to not only show us what they could do, but teach others to do it as well.<br />
The demonstration sucked.<br />
Okay, to be fair, they were good. The only problem was that their best demonstration was nearly half a kilometre away, and nearly impossible to see. Our cheering could be best described as &#8220;reserved&#8221;.<br />
Hamburgers were on the menu that night. We were lucky &#8212; our meals were provided by a catering company (who did an excellent job). Last year, those who went on the trip were preparing their own meals. Relaxation is much easier when you only need to show up and eat.<br />
Entertainment for the first night in Westbank was courtesy of several &#8220;amateur&#8221; (though they certainly sound professional) DJs who work in various parts of the company. The second night&#8217;s entertainment was also musical, but certainly more &#8230; interesting.<br />
Karaoke.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;You did karaoke??&#8221; Well, *I* didn&#8217;t do karaoke, but just about everyone else did. Why didn&#8217;t I? Aside from a terminal case of stage fright, I also happen to be extremely self-conscious about my inability to sing. Hey, when you take a jab at yourself in front of your friends (such as &#8220;I sing horribly&#8221;), and they don&#8217;t respond the way friends normally do (such as &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not *that* bad&#8221;), you know you suck.<br />
Mike (the guy with the independent film fetish) was anxious to get on stage and show his stuff. (Mike&#8217;s a little weird.) He wasn&#8217;t the first on stage. That was Geoff Mackenzie.<br />
Geoff&#8217;s a character. (Must be in the name.) He was dressed in jeans (pants and jacket), a somewhat-loud cowboy-like shirt, and a corduroy cowboy hat. The first song of the evening was &#8220;Stand By Your Man&#8221;. And no, he didn&#8217;t change the lyrics one bit. Geoff&#8217;s performance (with heavy doses of ham) set the tone for the evening, and it went downhill from there.<br />
Chris (my roommate, friend, and fellow troublemaker) was up shortly after Geoff. Chris erupted onto the stage with an opening that went somewhat like this: &#8220;Aight, they didn&#8217;t have any NWA, so instead, this one goes out to all my Critical Mass niggaz and all my Critical Mass shortys. Let&#8217;s roll up on this motherf***er&#8230;&#8221; He did Lionel Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Easy (Like Sunday Morning)&#8221;. With audience participation. Shannon, another of my co-workers who knows Chris, was sitting on the balcony outside his motel room (there was a motel-like building that housed another six rooms of people) was duly impressed with Chris&#8217; performance. It led to a return to the stage for a duet with Rob (who&#8217;s in Design, I think) to do &#8220;Ebony and Ivory&#8221;. Rob and Chris lapped up the audience&#8217;s appreciation.<br />
During a needed sprint back to my cabin (bathroom break), I missed the opening of one of the headlining acts for the night: Ted and Dewi. They brought their own music (they figured the karaoke company wouldn&#8217;t have the song they wanted to do) &#8212; Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;Larger Than Life&#8221;. Only they had help &#8212; four others who did the now-famous chair dance while Ted and Dewi crooned. (I should point out that this was not only set up well in advance, but the chair dancers practiced their moves before strutting their stuff in public.) The audience might as well have been from an actual Backstreet Boys concert from the amount of screaming and cheering&#8230;<br />
Geoff came back for another round of fun, performing that Johnny Cash classic, &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;. You&#8217;d never think so many people would be so into karaoke. I guess it all depends on who&#8217;s up performing. I think I have a whole new appreciation for that brand of entertainment. For example, we staged the first ever Tiffany mosh pit when two singing souls (Steve and Andrew) did their rendition of &#8220;I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now&#8221;. It was a sign of things to come.<br />
Anyway, Geoff stole the show again, and then managed to get everyone in the tent to break a few hundred noise by-laws by screaming at the top of their lungs. I think my Aunt Alaine and Uncle David (who live on the other side of the lake) could probably have heard us that evening. Luckily, the cops never showed up.<br />
The fight for the limelight also included Shawn Conners (one of the Conners Brothers). Shawn is about as perfect a specimen of a (pardon the language) &#8220;shit disturber&#8221; as I have ever met. He is also an artiste (note the extra &#8216;e&#8217;) and the biggest honey-glazed ham I have ever had the pleasure to have known. He and Colin did a great version of Milli Vanilli&#8217;s &#8220;Blame It On The Rain&#8221;. But Shawn wasn&#8217;t content with a simple singing version &#8212; he had to go that one step further and dump a bottle of water on himself (very much like in &#8220;Flashdance&#8221; &#8212; I still think they should have been doing &#8220;What A Feeling&#8221;) while striking an overly-dramatic pose.<br />
I made a hasty departure when Dave and his posse started singing &#8220;American Pie&#8221;. Keith&#8217;s a great singer, but it was a riot just waiting to happen. I hung out at the fire pit for a while, talking with some of the people who had fled the chaos, before retreating to Cabin #6 sometime around 1am, after the karaoke had broken down into a rave.<br />
I woke earlier the next morning and found my way to the big tent, where others were waiting for lunch. Breakfast had just ended, but I didn&#8217;t miss anything (muffins and fruit salad every morning were not enough of a reason for me to get up early). Lunch that day were smokies, and the tent was packed with hungry people waiting to eat.<br />
The afternoon was relaxed again. Some people slept, many others disappeared into town again, in search of amenities. Several went to see &#8220;X-Men&#8221; playing at the local cheapie theatre. I wandered around, talked with people, watched others try to wakeboard, sat around the campfire (which I think never went out from the moment it was lit), and watched others play cards.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t bored. Boredom comes when you want to do something, but are unable to determine what it is you want to do. I was trying to avoid activity. I was letting my mind turn to mush for a while. By purposely not thinking or doing anything, I was letting myself relax. I haven&#8217;t done it in a very long time, and it was hugely relaxing.<br />
One thing that required the use of my brain somewhat was reading the paper. Someone had left a copy of the Vancouver Sun on the table in my cabin, and I figured I&#8217;d see what was going down in the Lower Mainland. Aside from a massive sewer rupture spilling millions of litres of untreated sewage into Burrard Inlet, it seemed that not much had changed since I left &#8212; same political name-calling, same sports successes, and school was back in session (you know it&#8217;s a slow news day when&#8230;) It was very comforting to read a newspaper &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t read one since I was staying at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s here in Calgary.<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating one bit. While the previous day had been nice (although the night had been quite cold), we had bursts of rain for most of the day. Although right before dinner, we found ourselves gazing at the largest and most vivid double-rainbow I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve never seen a complete rainbow before, either &#8212; usually the top or either end is missing, but this one was a complete 180-degree arc. It was awe-inspiring. The joke that immediately followed was a query about how much Ted paid to have a rainbow appear before dinner.<br />
Our last supper in Westbank was steak and salmon, with baked potatoes and Caesar salad. Those of us who could, pigged out. Aside from the bones, it was great. (Although we apparently ran out of salmon, and I feel a little guilty for getting as much as I did. Only a little &#8212; it was Pacific salmon, after all.)<br />
Dessert was a special one that night. It was Ted&#8217;s birthday, and we had three cakes to spread around. Two of the cakes bore our Critical Mass propaganda logo, the third bore a relief sculpture of a caricature of Ted&#8217;s face. In icing. It was beautiful &#8230; and the artist (Mark Gervais) didn&#8217;t get fired for it.<br />
It was Caribbean night. This meant loud polyester shirts, shorts, and lots and lots and lots and lots of booze. (We went through between 9,000 and 13,000 pounds of booze in the weekend.) The Caribbean music (although good), lasted only long enough to get Ted (who was a little past plastered) to take a few swings at a piñata. Then the DJs got back into their swing, and the rave got going again. This was probably the most intense it had been since we got there, but most people realized that this was their last night to really let loose. And most of them did.<br />
Not being a dancer, nor finding anything else to do at that point, I found myself back at the fire pit again. Our group of six (comprising nearly every level and department in the company) engaged in hearty conversation. Our numbers soon swelled, when Ted arrived. (Wherever Ted goes, people go. It&#8217;s either an Einsteinian thing where people flow to the gravity well formed by Ted&#8217;s immense power, or they&#8217;re drawn like moths to candle flames. Either way, we soon had a lot of people.<br />
Ted was a little dismayed to find it was only 10:50. He had hoped it was 12:50. He wanted to go home, but thought it would be &#8230; well, wimpy of him to leave before 1am. Ted was wiped &#8212; the day had really taken a dent out of him, and he had two more hours to survive. Soon, there were about 50 people around the fire, and I&#8217;d lost my seat.<br />
Around midnight, the Rave Revolt began. First it started with Ted commenting that they&#8217;d played the same song for over three hours. Dan went over to &#8220;correct&#8221; the problem. He reported back (sans a change in music) saying Dewi protested, offering a change after &#8220;the first set&#8221;. Some of the more &#8220;senior&#8221; people (those over the age of 35) didn&#8217;t much like this answer. Ted decided it was time for action, and walked back towards the tent, muttering something about &#8220;Christmas bonuses&#8221;. A few minutes later, lyrics returned to the music, and the beat was noticeably different.<br />
It&#8217;s something that I think the older folk don&#8217;t quite understand. Rave music is meant to have a single beat that lasts for hours. It&#8217;s a challenge to keep the beat while changing the songs. The beat, although important, isn&#8217;t everything &#8212; melodies change, different layers of sound are woven in and out, even some lyrics thrown in for good measure. But it&#8217;s a sign of a skilled DJ who can make several hours of music sound like one song.<br />
By about 2:30 in the morning, there were only nine: Chris, myself, Ben, Adrian, Virgil, Mike (different Mike), Teak, Simone, and Marcie. We talked. All night. Our first major topic of conversations was 80s TV themes. Ben is the King of 80s TV. He knows the themes from virtually every TV show that aired from 1979 to 1991, except the really obscure ones like Automan, Manimal, Outlaws, and The Highwayman (bonus points to you if you a) even remember what they were, and double points if b) you can describe them.)<br />
Marcie and Simone left shortly before we finished that topic, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s time for bed&#8221;. Adrian suggested we do movie quotes &#8212; you give the quote, and the rest had to guess it. Chris and I had a decided advantage, having a) watched about a billion movies, and b) spent a great deal of time memorizing lines. For everyone who thought we were wasting our time, I offer you the fruits of our labour. Of course, Chris and I were always telling each other not to speak up, because we knew that the other would know the quote.<br />
Yeah, yeah, we act like we&#8217;re married. Like we haven&#8217;t heard that a thousand times before. It doesn&#8217;t help that we&#8217;ve been good friends for 13 years.<br />
Somewhere around 3:30am, Simone and Marcie returned to our circle, not having made it to bed. They&#8217;d been distracted by another social gathering elsewhere (assumedly not one as geeky as ours), but instead of going to bed when it broke up, they came back to us. (So I guess we&#8217;re not that geeky. No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
Somewhere around 4:00am or so, it began to rain. A lot. It was the sort of rain you knew would get you utterly soaked. And with the wind picking up, it was going to get us cold very quickly. We retreated to the big tent. We flipped on the lights, cranked up the heater, and returned to our little games. Ben bailed on us about 30 minutes later, leaving just the Group of Eight.<br />
When morning finally arrived, we started the process of getting ready to leave. Chris and I showered, packed, and hauled our stuff out to the Resort office porch, awaiting arrival of the busses. We then ate breakfast (muffins and fruit salad) and watched the sun come up. Figures that the day we leave good weather returns to Westbank.<br />
When the busses showed up, people started jumping on them. That started trouble. People (in general) are stupid. People don&#8217;t think about big pictures, what needs to be done, bla bla bla. That&#8217;s why we have visionaries. And anal retentive busy-bodies. (They&#8217;re often one-in-the-same, but that&#8217;s another long essay.) This is when I called upon the bus leaders to get their acts in gear, or we weren&#8217;t getting all the sound equipment, leftovers, and tents onto the busses.<br />
Chrissie (now the designated Bus Master), quickly knighted me and gave me the power to order others around. Holding everyone else back, we loaded our leftovers and whatnot onto the busses before letting everyone else suck up the rest of the space with their belongings. Packing took about 30 minutes.<br />
Chris was nowhere in sight. Having made mention to it earlier in the day (or later in the night before, take your choice), he had probably grabbed a seat with Marcie. (I would find out I was right after our first stop in Revelstoke.) I was seated behind Yasmin, one of our new people &#8212; she&#8217;s an Information Architect, and in front of Rich, one of our Project Managers. Along with most of the bus, we slept most of the way back to Calgary.<br />
We watched three movies: &#8220;Dumb and Dumber&#8221;, &#8220;Big Trouble In Little China&#8221;, and part of &#8220;True Lies&#8221;. When I was awake, I wasn&#8217;t watching the movies most of the time &#8212; I was watching the scenery. The day was so bright, and I wasn&#8217;t driving, that I got my first really good look at the sights to be seen in the mountains. There were a few times that I wished I could have stopped the bus just so I could look around.<br />
Arriving in Calgary, chaos ensued when we unloaded. But soon Chris and I were safe and sound at home. Overall, it was a great weekend, except for the 18 hours spent on the road. Those were a little more tedious. But I can think of worse things &#8212; 18 hours across the Prairies, for example.<br />
This morning, people were tired, foggy, semi-unconcious &#8212; basically everything you&#8217;d expect from such a weekend. Productivity will take a day or two to get back to normal. Whatever normal is&#8230;<br />
One last note: It was minus one this morning as I walked to work. The shorts are gone, the fleece is out, and the sandals are bare moments from being packed away. Summer is definitely over.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I left Vancouver nearly six months ago. At once, it feels like a lifetime ago, and it feels like yesterday. During the past six months, I have sat at my desk, on my couch, or laid in bed wondering what might have been had I not left. Today, the answer is clear.<br />
Today, had I not run for, and away from my life, I would be a married man. Today was my wedding day.<br />
I can stand (were I not at my desk working) and say with confidence that I made the right decision &#8230; for me, that is. You might wonder if I feel any regret or remorse for what I did six months ago. To a degree, yes, I do. I ruined the hopes and dreams of a human being, regardless of what she did to me. Today, she is thinking about what might have been. But I am not thinking of her.<br />
I am thinking of me. I am thinking that I haven&#8217;t been this free and happy in over two and a half years. I have been responsible for my own choices, my own decisions, and my own mistakes. I am happy with who I have become, and with who I am.<br />
Weddings are supposed to be one of the happiest days in someone&#8217;s life. Many of my friends (nearly all of my university friends) are now married. I think I am one of a very small handful who are not. I have only been to two weddings so far &#8212; that of a co-worker, and I was dragged to the other. I missed two weddings I was invited to because of financial reasons. I missed seeing these happy days.<br />
Yet as I sit here and type, I cannot imagine a happier day for myself. I wake up each and every day and am thankful for what I did. Yes, these past couple of weeks have been very difficult on myself, with tight deadlines and a heavy workload, but even though I might gripe about my workload, I am truly happy. I would hope everyone can feel at least as much joy as I do, for it is truly exhilarating.<br />
Today is also the wedding day of one of my former colleagues at Radical Entertainment &#8230; of one of my friends. Right now, she is probably in Quebec, saying her vows to her long-time partner. (This is more speculation, as plans change and I haven&#8217;t spoken to her since I left. Not to mention that I don&#8217;t know what time the ceremony is supposed to be.) For them, I raise my cup in toast. (I hope you don&#8217;t mind warm, stale Coke &#8212; it&#8217;s all I have at the moment.)<br />
Today used to be a date I dreaded would one day come. But it came without fanfare, and it would have come without notice, had I chosen not to say something. It is an ordinary day, like any other. And I will revel in it, just as I have every other ordinary day, because there is nothing more special than happiness.</p>

		<p>Owing to a very hectic week, I really haven&#8217;t had a chance to get to this one. Hopefully my workload will drop a bit in the not-too-distant future so I can return to the simpler things in life &#8230; like writing eight-page emails that I know you all love so much.<br />
Cathy and Craig were due to come out and visit and see the Great Province of Alberta. Neither had taken any vacation time in a while, and both needed it badly. Despite an impending launch for the new version of our largest client&#8217;s website, I took two days on Monday and Tuesday so that I could spend some time with my sister and (pseudo-)brother-in-law. This (supposedly) was not a problem &#8230; would find out after my return that taking vacation around a launch date of our largest client&#8217;s website is not a good idea&#8230;<br />
I arrived at the airport to meet them. Originally, the flight was to arrive around 6:30pm, but owing to a &#8220;mechanical problem&#8221; with their plane, the flight was delayed until 9:30pm. I&#8217;m still amazed at the things I could find to do in the airport for two hours.<br />
As I waited for Cathy and Craig, I began to notice that the Calgary Stampede must be close &#8230; there were an untold number of people wandering around in western garb, or at least with cowboy hats. (And no, this is not the sort of thing you see in Calgary on a regular basis.)<br />
Their flight in, we collected their bags, collected their rental car, and headed over to my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s. They (and my Nana, who was also there) wanted to see them. Besides, we needed our tickets to the Stampede. Yes, we were going. I&#8217;d never been and wanted to see what all the hype was about. I assume Cathy and Craig wanted to go for a similar reason.<br />
We were late leaving &#8212; about 11:30 or so &#8212; and didn&#8217;t get to bed until well after midnight. We were up the next morning at 6:30. It was the first morning of the Calgary Stampede, and it was also parade day. Every year, there&#8217;s a massive (and I mean massive &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest parade I&#8217;ve ever seen) through downtown of horses, marching bands, floats, quasi-important people, local (and not-so-local) Native peoples, and a lot of street sweepers. Those horses aren&#8217;t exactly toilet-trained, y&#8217;know&#8230;<br />
We were informed that we should get seats early. Many people had already beaten us to the punch, and had chairs set up at the side of the road. We sat on one of the creosote-soaked railway ties that made up one of the &#8220;gardens&#8221; along the south side of 9th Ave.<br />
The parade is popular. I think about half of Alberta turns out for it. I&#8217;ve seen parades where people line up to see things pass &#8212; you can usually wiggle yourself into the line to see. Not here. If you didn&#8217;t have a seat, you weren&#8217;t getting in. And that was on 9th &#8230; I&#8217;d hate to see what 6th Ave was like. Utter mayhem, I guess&#8230;<br />
The parade featured, as I said, people from all walks of life and all facets of the Stampede. And about a hundred marching bands. (There&#8217;s a competition at the Stampede every year.) The bands came from far and wide, including Minnesota (about four or five bands were from there), California, Alberta (of course), British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, and even Tongo. I didn&#8217;t even know Tongo had musical instruments, let alone a marching band! And a good one, at that!<br />
We ducked out before the parade was over. I had to go to work (unlike most of Calgary). Cathy and Craig took the opportunity to go find a pub. I directed them to Ceili&#8217;s (&#8220;Cayley&#8217;s&#8221;), down the street from where we live. We would meet up with them that night at the Stampede.<br />
Chris and I arrived at the Stampede grounds that night around 7:30. Picture the CNE (or PNE) grounds. Same general idea &#8230; with two or three times the number of people per square metre. It was complete chaos. It was the Calgary Stampede.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain what the Stampede means to this city unless you&#8217;ve been here to experience it. Nearly two months ago, the city started gearing up for it. Windows of shops and companies started receiving paint jobs &#8212; cartoonish cowboys, horses, cows, and western scenes. Light posts along nearly every major road in Calgary starting flying the Stampede banner. Advertising was prominent as far back as a month ago. Three weeks ago some companies started promoting Stampede events (the ubiquitous Stampede Breakfasts). Two weeks ago, the decorations went up. These involved whole trees cut into 1-2 inch thick planks, bark and all. These are nailed together to create the kitschy western &#8220;feel&#8221; of Stampede. Nearly every restaurant puts this stuff up.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the people. Everyone who is somewhat serious about this stuff pulls out the jeans, western shirts, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. (There&#8217;s a rumour of a little-known Calgary law that states you must have enough cowboy hats in each home for everyone currently living there.)<br />
The grounds were complete packed. Chris and I had to struggle (somewhat) to find our way. Our ultimate destination was the Grandstand, where we would meet up with everyone else. We got sidetracked by the Nokia PowerXone. I thought it was going to be a cool product exposition. It was in fact a large building with lots of open space, and a few stalls operated by local companies. I don&#8217;t think Nokia was even there&#8230; The only cool this was a full-size video dancing game, operated by two players who knew it so well they could dance while playing.<br />
The Grandstand is big &#8212; no-one seems to know how long it&#8217;s been there, but it&#8217;s a mainstay at the Stampede. While most of the Stampede is not unlike the CNE or the PNE (save for the abundant Bullseye BBQ Beef on a Bun stands), the Grandstand is the bastion of the time-honoured traditions: The rodeo and the Chriswagon races.<br />
We&#8217;d missed the rodeo (on earlier in the afternoon), but we were going to see the Chriswagon races and the &#8220;Grandstand Show&#8221;, whatever that was. After climbing almost all the way to the top (Aunt Brenda got us seats nearly at the top, which turned out to be an excellent vantage point to see everything at the races), we ran into my Aunt, Uncle, Jen (cousin), Cathy, and Craig.<br />
While most of us looked &#8220;normal&#8221; (in the sense that in any other major city in North America at that point, we would be indistinguishable from anyone else), Uncle Mike had dusted off his cowboy clothes. Although he played it down a bit by leaving the hat at home. At least one of us was playing cowboy.<br />
We found our way to our seats and watched the spectacle unfold. The Chriswagon races have evolved a bit to stay with the times. Originally, they were real Chriswagons, with real cast-iron stoves. Then a few too many horses and riders were getting killed, and many an outrider was throwing their back out trying to load the heavy stove. As with most competitive sports, things changed.<br />
Today, the wagons are wagon-like, but smaller and more compact. The stove is now a small red barrel (assumedly with some weight to it). The races are limited to four Chriss, and four teams of outriders. (Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get to the description in a moment.) The races are probably faster than they were before, and accidents less (although people do still get injured and killed).<br />
The races are fairly simple. There are four teams: one Chriswagon (pulled by four horses) with one driver, and four &#8220;outriders&#8221; each with a horse. All four teams start lined up at four sets of barrels; one outrider holds the team in place, the other three poised to load the &#8220;tent&#8221; and &#8220;stove&#8221; into the wagon. The barrels are arranged in a 1/6 of a circle, with a second set of barrels about one Chriswagon length away from that.<br />
At the horn, the three rear outriders throw the contents in, and the fourth lets go of the team. The Chriswagons are actually pointed away from the race direction. They race from the first barrel, around the second (some cars don&#8217;t turn that tightly), and then charge towards the actual racetrack. It&#8217;s usually pretty close. The outriders then have to hop onto their horses and sprint after the Chriswagons. They can&#8217;t get ahead of their wagon, but they can&#8217;t fall behind it either. The outriders are pretty useless, actually, aside from loading the wagons. (In fact, outriders are recycled across all the races, and are independent of the drivers.) The race is one lap &#8212; first one to the end, without penalty, usually wins.<br />
It&#8217;s rather amazing how much some people can get into this sort of thing. You&#8217;d think: &#8220;They&#8217;re wagons. Racing around a track. Whoopee.&#8221; Chris thought that. He got into it &#8212; he actually found himself cheering for the drivers. It&#8217;s crazy.<br />
Even crazier is the sponsoring. Chriswagon racing is big in these here parts. So much so, companies put down as much as $165,000 just to have the cover of the Chriswagon bear their logo. (Aunt Brenda tells me that this is down from years past. I wonder what the prices used to go for?)<br />
There were nine heats of racing, after which there was a short intermission where the Skyhawks flew into the Grandstand. (You may remember them from [[BC Rail Royal Hudson 2860, West Coast Railway Association, Comox Airshow, and Skyhawks]].) This was their second flight of the day, after a somewhat disastrous first flight (one of the parachuters missed their mark and collided with an ambulance &#8230; at least they hit the one thing they needed the most). Shortly after, they hauled out the stage.<br />
This was the first year for this new stage. It&#8217;s big. It needs the biggest farm tractor they could find to move it into place. But after only a few minutes of tweaking, it&#8217;s ready for use. And so began the Grandstand Show.<br />
The best analogy is if you took a Vegas show and put it outdoors. In fact, they go so far as to call the show &#8220;The Best Show in the Great Outdoors&#8221;, or something like that. It&#8217;s not a claim they make lightly, nor is does it falls short of the claim. It&#8217;s pretty impressive, even if the most famous person is Tom Jackson (of North of 60). Admittedly, he does have a very cool voice, which came into play in the show&#8217;s finale.<br />
The show started off with the singing of the National Anthem &#8230; by a three-year old girl. There&#8217;s no physical way a three-year old should be able to sing that well. Especially when I can&#8217;t. She had it all memorized, although she paused a while in between verses, either to remember the next line or out of fear. It&#8217;s not easy getting in front of 10,000-odd people and perform flawlessly.<br />
The entertainment consisted of the Young Canadians (a 100,000-person singing and dancing troupe), some soul singer I&#8217;d never heard of (although he was all the way from New York, so assumedly he couldn&#8217;t have been *that* bad), a juggler (one of the better ones I&#8217;ve seen), a not-so-good comedian all the way from Saskatchewan (whose jokes mostly revolved around Saskatchewan and speaking French), and of course, Tom Jackson.<br />
Stuart had warned us of the &#8220;Young Canadians&#8221;, alluding them to be like the &#8220;Duff Singers&#8221; on &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221;. Thankfully, we were not subjected to such torture. Although they were slightly too cutesy, it wasn&#8217;t too bad. There was no way to count the exact number of them, because they were all over the place. Excellent choreography, I have to say &#8212; much better than I&#8217;ve seen in other live shows.<br />
The evening ended with a telling of the dreamcatcher fable from Native lore. It was an impressive show that I found really interesting &#8230; and that was without the fireworks going off all over the place. I never thought you could work pyrotechnics into a show that wasn&#8217;t featuring loud music, but apparently you can.<br />
Oh yeah, I should also mention the beer. Budweiser seems to be the supplier for all the beer at the Stampede (oh, how can I contain my joy?) &#8212; I think Cathy, Craig, and Uncle Mike tried their best to take a dent out of that supply. The three of them, especially Craig and Mike, were utter wrecks by the end of the evening. It didn&#8217;t help that Cathy and Craig still hadn&#8217;t adjusted to the time zone, so were in considerably worse condition.<br />
I won&#8217;t mention the &#8220;serving wenches&#8221;. Okay, I just did, but it&#8217;s an inside joke that only those who were there will get&#8230;<br />
At first, the general consensus was to go home. However, Jen decided that she was dragging someone on a ride, even if it killed them. I was game, I have to say that. HOWEVER, Cathy was pleading to go to bed. So I refused. So Jen got Craig to go. Cathy apparently was unable to stop him.<br />
We didn&#8217;t actually get out of the grounds until after 1am. This was partly because every time we tried to get everyone together, half of them disappeared. Cathy, Craig, and Uncle Mike were still loopy by the time we got to the C-Train station. [More references to &#8220;serving wenches&#8221; go here.]<br />
No-one (in either household) rose early the next morning. Although I wanted to drag Cathy and Craig out to dim sum, they were &#8230; how shall I put this? &#8230; not well. There was only one solution to their problem &#8212; breakfast at Dunn&#8217;s.<br />
Dunn&#8217;s Famous Delicatessen was a mainstay in Ottawa for years. Chris and Gerry used to frequent it at all hours of the day (and night) when they were in school. Cathy and her friends lived with one of the chefs, so had an open door policy (not that the place ever closed). It was a sad day when Dunn&#8217;s (in the Market) closed. I have many fond memories of eating breakfast at any time during the day (I love all-day breakfasts) at Dunn&#8217;s in the Market. I miss it. There&#8217;s still one on Bank Street, but it&#8217;s just not the same.<br />
Neither is the one out here. It&#8217;s not a deli &#8212; it&#8217;s a restaurant. But it&#8217;s not that bad. The breakfasts were similar, and good. It perked up Craig and Cathy. Afterwards, we returned to the apartment (after making a quick beer run) and prepared for the evening&#8217;s festivities.<br />
Chris initially didn&#8217;t want to come with us. So I left him phone numbers should he change his mind. With that, Cathy, Craig, and I took off to the Northeast. Pam (another cousin of ours) arrived to join us in our revelry. Almost as soon as we got there, the question arose: &#8220;Where is Chris?&#8221;<br />
The annoying began.<br />
I made the first call, to let him know that his presence was desired. I made a second call about 30 minutes later to remind him. But I didn&#8217;t make the first call. Nana did. Chris had never met Nana before. Never even spoken to him before. So naturally, Chris was a little caught off guard when he received a phone call from a strange elderly woman. But it finally convinced him to come out.<br />
The evening lasted well into the night. It included more food than we really knew what to do with (all of it very good), and my first taste of scotch. Several months ago, when Uncle Mike and I were both job-hunting, we had wandered into the local liquor store. Mike had pointed out his favourite scotch, one I&#8217;d never seen before. (I may not drink the stuff, but I do know what the good stuff is.) Mike made me agree that when he got his new job, we&#8217;d toast it with a shot of scotch.<br />
I&#8217;m not a scotch drinker. Never was, and after tasting the stuff, I doubt I ever will be. It&#8217;s an acquired taste, and it&#8217;s not one I&#8217;m really keen to acquire. I will admit that it&#8217;s an interesting drink, and I can understand why there are those who are obsessed with it. It&#8217;s too strong for me (I&#8217;m a weakling, I guess) &#8212; I draw my line at 7.5% beer. (Okay, wine is stronger, but that&#8217;s a whole other issue&#8230;)<br />
As we approached our apartment (following the soiree), my cell phone rang. A rarity on its own (not many people call my cell anymore), the fact that it was somewhere past midnight just made the mystery all the more interesting. It was Jim and Frank, returning from their trek to BC. They happened to be calling from the same bar we were passing at that exact moment. [Insert theme to Twilight Zone here.]<br />
Ah, you probably haven&#8217;t heard the saga of Jim and Frank. They&#8217;re Chris&#8217; friends. Chris gave Jim his car when he moved out here. Jim thought it would be a good idea to drive the car (a 1987 Dodge Shadow) to BC and back. There&#8217;s a massive story I could get into here, but I&#8217;ll save you the agony. In short: We never thought the car would make it. (Okay, Chris thought the car would make it; I was amazed the car made it as far as Calgary, let alone two trips over the mountains.)<br />
They were on their return leg, and were looking for a place to stay. Chris and I maintain an open door policy &#8212; it&#8217;s open, so long as it&#8217;s not locked. I was a little worried what Cathy and Craig would say, but they were alright with it &#8212; so I was alright with it. Chris and I slept in the living room that night. (I was sleeping on the couch anyway&#8230;)<br />
Surprisingly enough, the next morning wasn&#8217;t so bad. This further extends Stuart&#8217;s theory that draft beer, although tastier, is worse for you than bottled (or in some cases, canned) beer. I think medical science needs to devote funds to solving this problem.<br />
The tour of the day was Drumheller, home of the Royal Tyrell Museum. This was after a considerable debate as to whether it would be Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump or Drumheller. After a bit of pushing to Drumheller (more to see, frankly more interesting), we loaded up the rented Oldsmobile Alero, and hit the road.<br />
It takes about an hour and a half to get to Drumheller (it&#8217;s not a long drive, but it&#8217;s a little tedious &#8212; there ain&#8217;t much there). It was the first time Cathy&#8217;d been in the Prairies since about 1993 &#8212; it was a first for Craig. Most of the time they marvelled at the yellow fields of &#8230; something (I think it was either mustard seed or canola, but I&#8217;m not sure which). But when we rounded the corner at Horseshoe Canyon, the marvelling skyrocketed.<br />
Starting at Horseshoe Canyon (at least on this road), the Prairies suddenly give way to massive gouges in the ground, carved by wind and rain over millennia. The Badlands. It&#8217;s impressive to see, or at least so Cathy and Craig thought.<br />
The Town (City?) of Drumheller sits in the Red Deer River valley, which I assume is part of the Badlands. It&#8217;s not huge by any means, but because of the geography it sits in, it&#8217;s laid out according to space in the valley itself. It had been over a year since I was last there (see [[A Boys Night out in Calgary, Drumheller, Banff (Bamf!), and Star Wars]]), and it didn&#8217;t really look all that different. Actually, it didn&#8217;t look any different at all. About the same weather, just a few more people.<br />
We went directly to the Tyrell, opting to beat a few tour buses we passed on the way. There&#8217;s only one reason a tour bus would go to Drumheller. The frogs in the pond were quiet, possibly due to the larger number of cars and people, but otherwise it was just the way I last saw it.<br />
Cathy warned me ahead of time that she and Craig are not big readers. They&#8217;re more &#8220;visual&#8221; people, and prefer to see a museum, rather than read it. I was amazed at how fast they were going through the exhibits. I couldn&#8217;t help but speak up if I thought they might miss something interesting. I almost became a tour guide. (Most people would tell me to shut up, but I guess Cathy and Craig like it &#8212; they didn&#8217;t have to read at all.)<br />
About an hour after entering, we exited to the day air. A quick run up the lookout, and we were back down to the car and off. Wanting to stop for a quick drink (we&#8217;d packed beer and Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade into a cooler), we pulled off at McMullen Island. I emphasize &#8220;quick&#8221;. Cathy is a mosquito magnet. The moment she got out of the car, they swarmed her. We stayed only long enough for them to finish their drinks (I refrained &#8212; I was driving), and we bolted.<br />
I took them east of Drumheller to the Hoodoos. Not &#8220;The&#8221; Hoodoos, but one of many examples of granite-capped sandstone pillars. Cathy and Craig seemed impressed with the small stone structures, and like the other tourists, climbed all over them. Unlike most of the tourists, though, Craig aimed higher to get better pictures. I followed him &#8230; all the way to the top.<br />
I was amazed at how much out of shape I was. Last year, when Jay, Stuart, and I scuttled up the side, I hadn&#8217;t been quite so tired. I supposed it&#8217;s because the past two or three weeks have been completely occupied with work &#8212; sleep and almost any form of exercise has been a total afterthought. While we were up there, Craig snapped a couple of pictures of Cathy from a distance. Of course, she turned away when we were going to take the pictures. We tried whistling to get her attention, but we were too winded to whistle.<br />
After returning to the valley floor, the three of us climbed back into the car and returned to Drumheller. We stopped briefly at the (Star Mine) Suspension Bridge for a couple of pictures. Our next stop was for lunch at Boston Pizza. After that was a stop for gas, and then a stop at Horseshoe Canyon. The last stop was at home.<br />
Jim and Frank hadn&#8217;t left yet (they wouldn&#8217;t leave until the following day), opting to relax a bit before their push back to Ontario. Cathy, Craig, and I were aiming to go the Barley Mill for dinner and a beer or two, and invited Chris, Jim, and Frank to come. They said they might, but were aiming for Pongo, a restaurant on 17th Ave.<br />
The sky was not cooperating. It threatened to unleash a torrential downpour. Out here, threats are rarely empty. We ended up having to evacuate our patio table (despite carefully placed umbrellas) for the sanctity and dryness of the indoors. A powerful storm raged for a couple of hours, during which time we waited &#8230; and drank beer. I hadn&#8217;t had that much in a very long time (memories of my last trip to visit my friends and old roommates Jon and Stuart in Waterloo came to mind). Luckily, I didn&#8217;t pay for it the next morning&#8230;<br />
Monday was the day of the Big Trip. We were off just after 9:15am, heading into the mountains. Until this point, neither Craig nor Cathy had ever seen the Rockies. Craig had been to Vancouver before, but I have to say that the Rockies are more impressive than the Coastals. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were weaving our way through the range.<br />
Our first destination of the day was Banff. The Alero didn&#8217;t really guzzle gas, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t the most fuel efficient. It also had a tiny gas tank. We filled up there, and then were off to Lake Louise. We figured on two days in the Rockies, mostly owing to distances we had to cover and the need to enjoy it. Day One would cover Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, and the Columbia Icefields. Day Two would be Banff, Kananaskis Country, and then home. (As it stands, we didn&#8217;t make to Kananaskis.)<br />
We went directly to Moraine Lake. The skies were iffy at best, heavily clouded and looking like it might rain. Spots of sunshine periodically poked through, but I wasn&#8217;t really certain we&#8217;d get a good chance to see everything if we didn&#8217;t move before the skies opened. We got spots of rain throughout the day, but nothing to drench us. Luckily, the weather also kept the bugs to a minimum.<br />
Moraine Lake looked very different from the last time I saw it, with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. The snow was gone, the lake was blue (and I do mean blue), and there were more people than you could count (quite a few of whom came on bicycles up a very windy and steep hill). We stopped long enough to take a few pictures and use the bathroom. Then it was off to Lake Louise.<br />
There were lots of people there, too. About as many as when Gerry and I visited it nearly three years ago. Most of them seemed to be people in the marching bands (there was a troupe or two from Minnesota who were following our every move) &#8212; there were certainly enough tour buses to account for all of them. Again, we didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time there, preferring to get a few pictures and run. However, there was also the matter of food.<br />
It dawned on me that while were at Lake Louise, we should have eaten at Moraine Lake&#8217;s lodge. Chateau Lake Louise isn&#8217;t the most cost-effective way to eat (nor did I think we met the dress code). Nor is Lake Louise an easy place to find a bite to eat &#8212; aside from the hotels, there are only two restaurants. We got lucky with one of them, although our simple meal took over 45 minutes to appear. (Note to self: In future, bring lunch with you.)<br />
Then it was back on the highway and on our way to the Icefields Parkway. This is the only road that connects Banff with Jasper. The two National Parks butt up against each other, and are only connected by this single road. During parts of the year, namely winter, this road is closed &#8212; it&#8217;s impassable for upwards of three days at a time after heavy snowfall. It takes a while to check the highway for snow drifts and avalanche debris.<br />
The Icefields Parkway started as nothing more than a simple packtrain trail through the mountains. But in the 1930s, Canada implemented a work-relief program to expand the trail into a more passable road. This road was turned into the present Icefields Parkway in the 1960s. Today, it&#8217;s the best (and probably only) way to see 35 glaciers in five hours. It&#8217;s a spectacular drive with many awe-inspiring photo opportunities. It&#8217;s a real shame that it was cloudy that day.<br />
I was a little anxious to get to the Icefield Centre around 4:00pm, mostly because I thought the Centre closed at 5:00pm. I didn&#8217;t want Cathy and Craig to miss out on a good tour &#8230; particularly one I hadn&#8217;t done before myself. I wanted to see a glacier myself.<br />
Okay, I&#8217;d *seen* a glacier before &#8212; I lived in BC for two years, after all. But I&#8217;d never walked on one. There wasn&#8217;t anything the guides could tell me that I didn&#8217;t already know (years of reading Time Life books and watching Discovery and TLC certain improved my knowledge of such things), but that didn&#8217;t change the desire for the experience.<br />
We arrived about 4:10pm, and immediately changed into pants and shoes. It was cold. Very cold. Glaciers, particularly the Columbia Icefield, create a massive cold wind that constantly blows out of the mountains. It keeps everything in perpetual chill.<br />
The Icefield Centre sits at what used to be at the toe of the Athabasca Glacier (the glacier has since receded). It&#8217;s a relatively new building, built partly by Parks Canada and by Brewster Transportation, who runs the Snocoach tours on the glacier. (Brewster is an Alberta bus company that seems to own nearly every major mechanized tour in the province.) In addition to an interpretive centre, the Centre houses the Snocoach tour centre and a hotel.<br />
We jogged inside and got ourselves ready for a tour. Tickets for the tour aren&#8217;t cheap &#8212; $26 a pop. But it&#8217;s an hour long, and entertaining. We couldn&#8217;t get tickets until the 4:45 departure, which gave us ample time to wander around.<br />
The tour goes in two stages. The first stage is in a standard tour bus. This takes you on an eight-minute trip up the side of the mountain to the Snocoach departure station. The Snocoaches are huge, and not exactly speedy &#8212; it would make the trip about twice as long if had to leave from the Icefield Centre. The trip up from the Icefield Centre is somewhat informational. The introduction to the glacier, how it was formed, and how it transformed the valley.<br />
The driver took car to point things out like the lateral moraines, two huge piles of crushed rock the glacier created when it pushed its way down the mountain. They&#8217;re about 200 metres high, and well over a kilometre or two in length. Concrete companies would kill for something like that &#8212; but they&#8217;re well-protected in Jasper National Park.<br />
As we drove along, the driver identified many of the features (such as the moraines) to the passengers. One of them were the trees that lined the roads. Because of the cold wind that always blows off the glaciers, the trees were missing branches on one side &#8212; they were all swept back. When she asked the age of the trees, many people spouted off numbers. But I guessed right &#8212; 300 years. These trees might have been my height. The constant cold keeps the growing season to only 60-90 days a year. It is very possible that some of these trees might outlast the glacier, which is expected to disappear in 600 years at the current rate of recession.<br />
The road to the Snocoach departure is only partially paved. After a while, the pavement stops, and the road veers downhill. The paved section is the only part on bedrock &#8212; which doesn&#8217;t move. The rest, however, rests on what was once moraine, and is unstable. The bus took a nasty dip (about a 10% grade) on a road that was once level and straight. Even the Snocoach depot is on unstable ground &#8230; which is why none of the buildings there are permanent.<br />
We transferred from our bus to a Snocoach. These are basically enormous six-wheeled buses. The wheels are about two metres high, and under half the height of the bus. 22 of these buses were built, by a Calgary company no less, for use in such terrains. Brewster owns 21 of them. (The 22nd is run by the US Government in Antarctica.) They feature six-wheel drive, engine-reactive transmissions, and a top speed of about 45 kilometres an hour. Downhill. With a tailwind.<br />
Our driver, Steve Jobidon, claimed he was a 105 year-old retired school teacher. He claimed his longevity was from drinking glacier water. My guess is he was overestimating his age by about 80 years, although it was clear that Steve was an avid outdoors person &#8212; skiing, hiking, and all that kind of stuff. He had the tan and the wrinkles to prove it.<br />
The coach lurched out from its berth, turned, and headed towards what looked like a sheer cliff. It&#8217;s not too close form the truth. As the glacier recedes, the Snocoaches have to go down an increasingly steeper hill to get to it. The hill is quite long, and is the steepest unpaved hill in North America &#8212; a 35% grade. The Snocoaches are fitted with a transmission that will slow the Snocoach to a dead crawl (and in fact will stall the engine, ending the coach in an uncontrolled descent) to keep it on the road.<br />
At the bottom of the hill is a large pool of glacier water. This is intentional &#8212; drivers must wash the coach&#8217;s tires before entering the glacier&#8217;s top. Any extra dirt on the glacier will hasten its recession. (The glacier has retreated an estimated kilometre in the past 40-odd years, at least according to my relatives.) Only then does the Snocoach enter the top portion of the Athabasca Glacier.<br />
The Athabasca Glacier is one of several outlets for the Columbia Icefield, a massive 325 square kilometre mass of ice in the Canadian Rockies &#8212; the largest sub-polar icemass in the world. It&#8217;s also one of two hydrogeological apexes. Meltwater from the Icefield drains into three oceans: Pacific (though the Fraser river system), Arctic (through the Mackenzie river system), and the Atlantic (through the Saskatchewan river system, emptying into Hudson Bay). The only such apex is in Siberia. The Icefield, like its outflow glaciers, is also receding &#8212; my Aunt remembers it being 500 square kilometres when she was younger.<br />
Glaciers (including the Icefield) are formed from snow &#8212; lots of snow. More snow that you have ever seen in your life. Every snowfall buries and compresses the previous layers, recrystallizing the snow into grains similar in size and shape to grains of sugar. Over time, the grains grow larger, and air pockets between the grains get smaller, making the snow denser. After about two winters, compressed snow turns into firn &#8212; a stage between snow and glacier ice. Firn it is about half as dense as water. Older, larger ice crystals are so compressed that air pockets between them are very tiny. In very old glacier ice, crystals can reach several inches in length (this can take over a hundred years). The lack of air in glacier ice produces its distinctive blue colour.<br />
Brewster maintains a road on the glacier, about 300 metres long, or so. It takes the Snocoaches from the base of the hill to almost the centre of the glacier, where we tourists got a chance to hop out, and see what being on a glacier was all about.<br />
Well, for starters, it&#8217;s cold. Really cold. But not so cold that there isn&#8217;t runoff from the glacier. Some parts of the surface look frozen, but aren&#8217;t. I felt sorry for anyone silly enough to travel up there with sandals. I took several pictures, including one of a very cold Cathy, sipped the glacial water (which tasted like snow &#8212; go figure), and then got back on the bus before my fingers started going numb. (I was a little cold. It was also raining lightly, which didn&#8217;t help.)<br />
As we waited on the bus, we heard screaming from outside. At first, I thought a fissure opened up on the glacier and swallowed up a bus. Turned out it was the Minnesota marching band following us around &#8212; they were getting a group photo taken on the glacier.<br />
As we wheeled back to the Snocoach platform, Steve happily informed us of the three benefits of glacial water. The first was longevity (Steve claimed that this was one reason why a small glacier, currently known as the AA Glacier &#8212; it&#8217;s between Mount Athabasca and Mount Andromeda &#8212; was going to be named after the oldest tour guide there, namely him), the second was as an aphrodisiac, and the third as a laxative. He offered to speed the Snocoach&#8217;s return&#8230;<br />
Cathy drove on the way back to Banff. This gave me the opportunity to actually see what we drove through. I&#8217;ve been through several passes in the Rockies, nestled between Calgary, Kelowna, Hope, Kamloops, and Jasper. Of all the ones I&#8217;ve travelled on so far, the Icefields Parkway is by far the most beautiful. (I suspect the drive would be awesome on a sunny day.) We stopped several times to take pictures several times (in particular, Cathy was hunting for a moose, which we never saw). One day, I will go back &#8230; when it&#8217;s sunny.<br />
We arrived in Banff just after 8:30. It took us another 45 minutes to find a hotel that wasn&#8217;t booked or cost a fortune to stay at. Still cost us $180 for the night. On the other hand, we were close to downtown, which meant we could go out, eat, drink, and be merry, but still stagger back to the hotel without having to take a cab. This was important, considering I took them to St. James&#8217; Gate, the local Irish Pub (run by the same company that runs the Barley Mill).<br />
The following morning, we started our Banff tour. After checking out and stopping for coffee, we went to the Cave and Basin, the origin of Banff National Park (and to a certain extend, Parks Canada). The last (and only) time I&#8217;d been to Cave and Basin was with Chris, Therese, and Stuart, when we introduced Chris to the Rockies a month or so earlier.<br />
Back in the early 1880s, three men followed the CPR through the wilderness, hoping to make their fortunes. They came across a warm stream, and followed it to its source. Warm streams are rare in this part of the country &#8212; most are ice-cold. They found a hole in the ground that reeked of rotten eggs. Sulphur water. It was precisely what they were looking for &#8212; liquid money. They erected a small hut (which they called a hotel) and started charging people to come and bathe in the waters.<br />
Even back then, the Government was nosey. They got involved and a legal battle ensued. The Government won. They wanted to protect the area and created the Banff Park. To manage it, they created an organisation responsible for the parks. This was the birth of not only Banff National Park, but of Parks Canada.<br />
The Cave and Basin wasn&#8217;t really protected. For years, people swam in the basin (which unbeknownst to them harboured an extremely rare species of snail &#8212; it&#8217;s the only place in the world it&#8217;s found), and bottled the water. The Government built a pool to allow people to swim, and closed the basin to use. The pool was in use until the early 1980s, when it was closed for renovation. However, after the renovation was complete, no-one wanted to take over the maintenance. The pool was closed and remains for historical significance.<br />
The cave is nothing special, basically a big hole in the ground that someone blasted a small tunnel into. Warm water spills into the pool from a gap in the far wall, falling into the pool. It then drains off and out into the basin. And it smells really bad. Cathy couldn&#8217;t spend long in there before she had to get out.<br />
I then tortured Cathy even more by dragging her up the side of the mountain on a boardwalk, showing them where the cabin was, and here the water came from (inside the mountain). The water was rain and snow at one point. It seeps into the mountain, warms from the heat of the Earth, collects minerals (most importantly iron pyrite, which is full of sulphur), and flows back to the surface under pressure.<br />
Our next stop was the Upper Hot Springs, on the other side of the mountain. The Cave and Basin springs are cool &#8212; only about 30 degrees. The Upper Hot Springs are 40 degrees, and used every day by average people who want a nice, warm swim. They first take a bath, $7.00 from your wallet, to be precise, before taking a 20-minute soak. Any longer, and you run medical risk of turning into salt pork. But the faithful are always there, looking for whatever it is that draws them there. Frankly, I&#8217;ll wait until the winter, when its $5.50, and the summer tourists are gone.<br />
Finally, it was time for the big trip &#8212; up Sulphur Mountain itself. In the early 1940s, a man by the name of John Jaeggi started a service where he&#8217;d haul people up the side of the mountain in a farm tractor. He drove them up to a halfway station (still visible from the gondola), where passengers would have to walk the remainder of the distance to the top. This continued until he rolled the tractor (he was alone) in the late 1940s. But Jaeggi&#8217;s dream didn&#8217;t stop there &#8212; he figured an aerial tram would be a better method to get people to the top.<br />
Construction began in the Fall of 1958, and the first aerial cars started running 18 July 1959. It was a colossal project, with most of the equipment coming all the way from Switzerland (which had a great deal of experience with mountains). The Complex at the summit wasn&#8217;t built until 1980, and now serves at the terminus for the gondola, but also has two restaurants (Canada&#8217;s highest), a gift shop, and an observation tower.<br />
Jaeggi wasn&#8217;t the first up, however. The first person to use the mountain was Norman Bethune Sanson. He was the local meteorologist who took readings at the summit of Sanson&#8217;s Peak on Sulphur Mountain from the summer of 1903 until the summer of 1945. A small stone building remains as a testimony to his tenacity to track weather patterns in the Rockies.<br />
Cathy&#8217;s not big on heights &#8212; never was, or so I gather. Yet she was determined to get herself up there. With a lot of guts, we paid the $18 per person fee (really quite reasonable, when you think about it) and climbed in for the ride.<br />
The last time I was on a gondola of any kind was at the CNE. This one was considerably newer, and much nicer. The ride up, aside from the three towers, was very quiet. All we could hear was the wind. Cathy looked straight ahead into the mountain. She glanced only once or twice out any of the other windows, not wanting to know we were as much as 100 metres off the ground. She was very happy to get her foot back on solid ground. Given, we could have walked the trail that leads up the side, but it&#8217;s a two-hour hike, and none of us were that interested in the exercise.<br />
The view from the top of Sulphur Mountain is unbelievable. For anyone who wants to travel to Banff, it&#8217;s a &#8220;must-see&#8221;. Particularly on a sunny day. But bring a sweater &#8212; it&#8217;s cold up there. Craig, the poor guy, had only a t-shirt and shorts. He was freezing during our nice little hike.<br />
Between the gondola complex and Sanson&#8217;s &#8220;cabin&#8221;, there&#8217;s a one-kilometre boardwalk. It&#8217;s a nice trip, with lots to see. And a bit of wildlife, too. Bighorn sheep dot the sides of the boardwalk, particularly around the complex. They&#8217;re pretty docile, and probably well-fed by someone. Craig and I debated as to whether its the tourists or the employees, but it was obvious someone was feeding them.<br />
After our chilly hike, we stopped briefly for a drink in the restaurant. Then it was back down to the base of the mountain. It was time for lunch &#8230; at the Banff Springs Hotel. This was a recommendation from Aunt Brenda, who thought it would be something fun to do.<br />
Along the way, we made two stops. The first was at the Park Administrative Building, which sits at the foot of Banff Ave. Assumedly owing to Stampede (its influence extends a long way), there was a Native t epee and dancers showing their culture to the uncultured tourists. It was humorous to watch the Native elders get people to move in synch. But they didn&#8217;t do a bad job&#8230;<br />
The next (brief) stop was at Banff Falls, on the Bow River. It&#8217;s down the hill from Banff Springs. It&#8217;s more or less a giant rapid. Not horribly impressive, but neat. We tried to take a group photo, but Craig went through some elaborate process of getting the camera to look at us. A chap from Ireland offered to take the picture. In retrospect, it would&#8217;ve been a good idea &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if the camera ever got the picture before it tilted forward.<br />
Banff Springs is an impressive hotel to see from Sulphur Mountain, but equally as impressive from the ground. After parking the car, we ducked inside. We didn&#8217;t do a full tour of the hotel, but went right for the outdoor patio. Lunch took a little longer than I&#8217;d expected, but it was worth the wait. The winner for best meal was Cathy &#8212; a smoked salmon wrap that was absolutely delicious &#8230; would&#8217;ve been better without the cream cheese (at least in my opinion, but I don&#8217;t like the stuff). The meals are pretty reasonable, considering it is the jewel in CP Hotel&#8217;s crown.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long, knowing we had to be back in Calgary for dinner at Uncle Mike and Aunt Brenda&#8217;s. We arrived in Calgary just after 4:00, and we didn&#8217;t get to dinner until nearly an hour later. I had to work the next day, so we didn&#8217;t drag it out too long &#8212; we didn&#8217;t want to repeat Saturday.<br />
The next day was insanity. I didn&#8217;t get to see Cathy and Craig off. In fact, I worked solid until Saturday evening, save for a few breaks to go sleep.<br />
I need a vacation from their vacation&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It all started when I received an email during my stay in Cincinnati. (This was a couple of weeks ago, obviously.) It was entitled &#8220;Kicking Horse Blazing Paddles&#8221;. It was a call for those interested in experiencing the adrenaline of whitewater rafting on the Kicking Horse River.<br />
I need not mention that I was interested&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;d never been whitewater rafting before, but I knew a few people who had, and they all loved it. So, naturally, my curiosity was piqued enough to be interested, and certainly the opportunity to try something more invigorating than a rollercoaster was enthralling. I had my named added to the list of other half-suicidal CMassers.<br />
As it turned out, there would only be six of us: Sean (who organized the trip), his brother Robin, Shannon, Sara, and Sara&#8217;s significant other, Brett. We had hoped for eight, at which point we could get a group discount, but we settled with our six and hoped for the best trip we could get under the circumstances.<br />
What about Chris? Well, Chris has a love/hate relationship with water. He doesn&#8217;t much like it outside of showers (although he&#8217;s taken up a healthy swimming regiment as of late). He also hates the cold. Really hates the cold. Loathes the cold. His response to my invitation to join us was:</p>
<blockquote><p>HAHAHAAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH.<br />
Ha.<br />
Your [sic] a funny f&#8211;king lad&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We met early Saturday morning in the Critical Mass parking lot. Sean and his brother would drive in one car, Shannon and I in my car, and Sara and Brett in their SUV. Sean informed us that morning that we might in fact be late &#8212; there was the possibility that the drive could take upwards of four hours. Our trip was scheduled for noon. We were going to have to move fast.<br />
We left the parking lot, turned onto 10th Ave. SW, turned up 8th St., and then onto 6th Ave. Robin led us out to Sarcee Trail, which then took us to 16th Ave. (aka Trans Canada Highway), and then out of the city. For the next two hours, we stuck together like glue: Robin and Sean in front, Shannon and I in the middle, and Sara and Brett picking up the rear. This wasn&#8217;t particularly easy, since we hit speeds as high as 140 km/h making sure we got to our destination in time.<br />
Our destination was the Kootenay River Runners company, located on the Kicking Horse River about halfway between Field, BC and Golden, BC. This would be my first trip into British Columbia in almost four months. Admittedly, I was a little apprehensive at first, but I cast aside that irrational fear and plunged headlong&#8230;<br />
&#8230;into rain.<br />
Lots of it. Figures &#8212; I was going to BC, after all.<br />
It rained from almost the moment we left Calgary until just after we&#8217;d crossed the Kicking Horse Pass. So in a strange way, it wasn&#8217;t really raining *in* BC. Odd, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
The trip there was marked with Shannon and I discussing favourite movies, and me giving a brief history of Canadian development in the Rockies to Shannon. He didn&#8217;t know a lot about the area, and I guess I know more than I should. But he seemed interested, and (as most of you who know me will testify) I like to talk.<br />
We arrived at the Kootenay River Runner&#8217;s Whitewater Ranch at about 11:15 &#8212; way ahead of everyone else. We were listed as &#8220;early&#8221;. This gave us the chance to look around a little. The Whitewater Ranch is not as fancy as it sounds. Basically, it&#8217;s nothing more than a large shed (which houses most of the equipment and two washroom/change rooms), a couple of miscellaneous sheds, a half-completed barbecue shelter, and a large section of flood plain where the rafts waited to whisk us downriver.<br />
My first stop (after using the toilet) was to the river. The Kicking Horse River, like most of the rivers in the Rockies, is a glacial river. English translation: Frickin&#8217; cold. About one degree Celsius. Yes Virginia, it&#8217;s that cold. The river isn&#8217;t clear &#8212; it&#8217;s powder blue. This is from all the ice crystals suspended in the water. (This is also why glacial lakes, like Lake Louise, are blue.) And yes, it was very cold.<br />
People soon started arriving, and we opted to change into our rafting wear: Bathing suits and t-shirts. I gave up my sandals for my winter boots (basically over-grown shoes), as I wasn&#8217;t too keen on putting my bare feet into that river at any time. The guides (specifically one guy who we learned was called &#8220;Rhino&#8221; &#8212; he never told us why he was called that) and given the low-down on equipment.<br />
Our attire would not be limited to our swimsuits and t-shirts, for obvious reasons. (Namely, we&#8217;d develop hypothermia in less than a minute in these waters). Our first layer would be a swimsuit (or nothing at all), on top of which would be a wet suit. It wasn&#8217;t a full wetsuit, the top looked like neoprene overalls. On top of that would go a nylon fleece top, and a &#8220;spray jacket&#8221; on top of that (basically a slightly rubberized nylon shell). On top of that would be our life jacket. Our feet would have either neoprene &#8220;socks&#8221; or boots (or shoes, for those of us who couldn&#8217;t get the socks or boots). Lastly would be a helmet, so we wouldn&#8217;t knock ourselves silly on the rocks &#8230; or each other.<br />
Suiting up didn&#8217;t take too long, although some people had problems with the wetsuits, and one guy near me could not get the small fleece top over his extra large body. It was quite amusing to watch, though.<br />
After tossing our things onto one of two buses (we were only doing the Upper Kicking Horse portion of the river; roughly half of the group was also doing the Lower portion), we headed down to the river. There we got the safety speech. This is important. This is where you learn the basics of whitewater survival. Most of the time, you probably don&#8217;t need this speech &#8212; it&#8217;s for the worst-case scenarios.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we got it.<br />
The six of us ended up on raft #17. It&#8217;s a SOTAR (&#8220;State Of The Art Raft&#8221;), which basically means short of a nuclear blast, it&#8217;ll survive almost anything the river can offer. Our guide, Eric, was a nine-year veteran of river guiding, and had been guiding on this river for several years. He drove in from Vegreville (about five hours away) every weekend to send another group of hapless weekend warriors downriver to experience the thrill of freezing to death.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230;<br />
Before boarding, we had to finish adjusting our lifejackets. Most people who use them (not all do) wear them pretty loosely. In most cases, this is probably fine. However, if you&#8217;re going whitewater rafting, particularly in such cold water, the lifejacket has to be tight &#8230; so tight it&#8217;s difficult to breathe. Why? Because if you fall out of the boat, they use the jacket to haul you back in. Eric had to tie Sara&#8217;s jacket on extra tight &#8212; she&#8217;s not a large person, and she was swimming inside the flotation device.<br />
We piled in, Shannon and I in the bow, Brett and Sara behind us, Eric in the middle, Sean and Robin behind him, and a recently-married elderly couple behind them (I only learned the man&#8217;s name, Neil). After a quick shove-off, we started our journey.<br />
Eric reiterated the safety speech, just to make sure we all understood what was going on. He then sent us through some simple drills. Forward and backward paddling, alternating sides paddling, diving to one side or the other &#8212; basic things to get us down river. The key was to paddle in sync, which meant Shannon and I would spend more time watching each other than the river. This would come back to haunt us.<br />
The first portion of the river was fairly tame &#8212; the odd ripple, a couple of nice currents, but nothing major. Then Eric sent us into (what I guess is) a Class II rapid. Shannon and I got soaked. It was cold. Really cold. But unlike jumping into cold water and starting to hyperventilate, it wasn&#8217;t paralysing. After a couple of moments, the water warmed a bit (as a wetsuit is supposed to) and it became less uncomfortable. Sara, who was sitting behind me, wasn&#8217;t quite as comfortable &#8212; she hadn&#8217;t done up the collar on her spray jacket and got a few cups of ice-cold water down the front.<br />
About 45 minutes after leaving Whitewater Ranch, we pulled over at the side of the river for lunch. By this point we were hucking our lifejackets to try and cool off. It was quite warm with those things on so tight. Waiting for us was hot coffee, hot water (with packets of hot chocolate powder), and lunch &#8230; though the guides had to help setting it all up. Soon, lunch was called and we dropped into line to get it.<br />
Lunch was pretty simple &#8212; make-your-own sandwiches, pickles, caesar salad, cantaloupe, and cookies. The website had said there would be a barbecue, but the shelter wasn&#8217;t complete, so we didn&#8217;t get to partake in that. Maybe next time&#8230;<br />
Lunch wasn&#8217;t particularly lavish, but it was filling enough to occupy the voids beginning to form in our stomachs. The group of 60 (or so) filled out the small clearing, munching away and discussing the first leg of the trip. Some of us knew what was in store for the second leg (we&#8217;d already been filled in by co-workers who&#8217;d done the trip the year before), and were excited to get back on the water.<br />
Especially since we were beginning to get cold. The lifejackets were great insulation from the cold, which was now beginning to set in. We couldn&#8217;t wait to get buckled back in and paddling to warm up.<br />
We shifted seats a bit when we headed back out. Shannon moved back to where Sean was sitting, I moved to where Shannon was sitting, and Sean moved to where I was sitting. Didn&#8217;t change much beyond that. I had to switch to the other side because my right arm was beginning to hurt a bit, and I wanted to give my left a chance.<br />
Soon we were off, back into smaller rapids, getting wet, and having fun. Only about five minutes out, we pulled off to the side again. Eric claimed he had to get out and &#8220;get his bearings&#8221;. I think this is code for the guides to figure out where the largest wave is to scare the bejeebers out of the beginners in the raft. We were about to enter Shotgun Alley.<br />
This is a section of the Kicking Horse where rocks have created the most intense rapids in the Upper section of the river. They max out at Class V (out of a maximum of Class X). We couldn&#8217;t see around the corner, and so had no idea what we were about to get into. Eric came back, saying he knew what he was going to do, so loaded us up, and away we went.<br />
Shotgun doesn&#8217;t look as bad as it actually is &#8230; at least from the river. Maybe from above it looks worse, but it&#8217;s hard to tell when your guide is yelling &#8220;Forward Paddle! Forward Paddle!&#8221; and you&#8217;re trying to match your strokes with the guy next to/in front of you.<br />
Suddenly, the powder blue water had turned an angry white. The boat lurched down and a massive wave crashed over the bow, knocking me square in the chest, and into the bottom of the raft. I struggled to get myself back out, but by the time I could, another wave hammered me again. Realizing that there was just no way I could get myself back up on the bow, I stayed inside the boat and hauled my paddle outside and kept paddling.<br />
The boat lurched down and up again, and more ice-cold water briefly blinded me. I flailed with the paddle as best I could, but it was seconds before I could see again. When I did see again, I was quickly wishing I wasn&#8217;t seeing what was about to happen.<br />
Rocks.<br />
Big ones.<br />
Eric, our guide, had either steered us too close to the side of the river (which happened to end in a sheer rock face), or my inability to paddle properly had reduced the power on my side of the boat, steering us in. Can&#8217;t say which, because I honestly don&#8217;t know. Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we still hit solid rock.<br />
Well, &#8220;hit&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good verb. &#8220;Ran aground&#8221; would be more proper, I guess. The rock was sloped, and what&#8217;s what we ran onto. I could feel the rock beneath me as we ran onto it &#8212; but we didn&#8217;t stay there for long. The river&#8217;s current dragged the raft sideways (with the bow acting as the pivot) and then off the rock and down river.<br />
Right into a large Class V rapid known as &#8220;The Terminator&#8221;.<br />
The raft rolled sharply up on it&#8217;s side (my side being the low side). The sudden upward swing catapulted Sean off the raft. Neil, the old guy at the stern, slid off. I, who was still trying to get back on the side to try and paddle, found the side now slipping out from under me. I, too, fell into the icy Kicking Horse River.<br />
We had been told at the safety orientation that when faced with a large rapid that the guide would yell &#8220;hold on&#8221; and we would grab a rope called the &#8220;centre line&#8221; that ran down the length of the raft. However, the call never came, and I didn&#8217;t see the rapid before it was too late. We&#8217;d also been told that in the event that you couldn&#8217;t grab the centre line, there was another rope that ran around the outside of the raft. This was called (and please pardon the language) the &#8220;Oh Shit!&#8221; line, so named because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re usually yelling as you fall off.<br />
Luckily, my three years in sailing school had ingrained in me a survival instinct to stay with the boat. After my foot slipped out from under the centre line (I had tried to hike myself back in using that method), I reached for the OS line. Brett was immediately at the side of the raft to help me back in. As we were instructed during our training, I brought my paddle hand out of the water to hand them my paddle &#8230; only it wasn&#8217;t there. In the rush of falling out, I somehow had let go of it. Admittedly, it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on my mind at the time.<br />
Brett hauled me back in on the count of three, and we tried to resume a somewhat stable position. My immediate thought was &#8220;Where the heck is Sean?&#8221; &#8212; he wasn&#8217;t there (I didn&#8217;t know at the time that he&#8217;d been thrown clear off). I looked behind us and saw Sean floating some 100 metres away near the side of the river (the side with the sheer cliff).<br />
As we would find out later, Sean was trying to save his butt. He had managed to hang onto his paddle longer than me, but had turfed it in favour of saving himself. The raft behind us had tried to save him with one of the oars, but just as Sean reached for it, a rapid sucked him under. When he came back up, the raft was too far away, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any warmer. Sean saw a tree near the side, and swam for safety.<br />
Unfortunately, this meant that Sean was trapped at the side of a frigid raging river with no obvious way out. He&#8217;d also lost one of his neoprene boots in the chaos. (But he still had his contact lenses and his waterproof camera.) One of the rafts pulled to the same side of the river as Sean, and the guide went back to retrieve our fallen comrade-in-paddles. It was nearly 30 minutes before we saw them in the trees &#8212; we greeted Sean&#8217;s safe return with loud cat calls.<br />
A few minutes later, Sean was returned to our raft. Two paddles were passed forward, and we continued our trip. Sean and I stuck to the bow, unafraid of what would befall us (having already been befallen) and kept taking the waves. About 20 minutes later, we arrived at the end of our trip.<br />
Half of the group was continuing onto the Lower Kicking Horse, but had to leave the river and drive a bit further down. There&#8217;s a stretch between the Upper Kicking Horse and the Lower Kicking Horse that Eric described as &#8220;impassable&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t elaborate.<br />
Eric was called away to guide one of the Lower rafts, so bade us farewell, and darted away. We were left to peel our waterlogged clothes off, and put our dry clothes (which came in the bus) back on.<br />
We would find out that our raft wasn&#8217;t the only one to be taken out by the Terminator. Two other rafts from another company (which had entered the slot not long before us) had flipped. We got off lucky. Eric must have seen the spectacle, and opted not to tell us so that it wouldn&#8217;t get us worried. Luckily, we&#8217;d gone through a flip drill (not actual, but talked through it) in the event that happened.<br />
We changed, put all our wet things into huge piles, and boarded a bus to take us back to Whitewater Ranch. There we got back into our cars and made for the trip home. I had hoped to convince everyone to stop in Banff and go to the Irish pub there for dinner. I didn&#8217;t seem to get any initial takers, but Sean and Robin said they&#8217;d want to stop somewhere. The consensus was to drive back, and we&#8217;d stop somewhere along the way.<br />
Robin and Sean took the lead, and promptly started to disappear. I don&#8217;t know what their hurry was, but the rest of us had a heck of a time trying to keep up. I was cursing them for about an hour until I finally said &#8220;the heck with it&#8221;, and pulled ahead from Sara and Brett, hoping that they might be able to catch up later. Someone had to tell the other two to slow down.<br />
A couple of times I came close, but as soon as I got within honking distance, they pulled ahead and I couldn&#8217;t catch up. It wasn&#8217;t until we got back to a four-lane divided highway that I managed to catch them. Doing 150 km/h. In a 90 km/h zone. (If I&#8217;m *really* lucky, I won&#8217;t get a speeding ticket.)<br />
I chewed them out over the phone about 30 minutes later, after the cell phone signal was restored. Brett and Sara were nowhere in sight. I finally convinced Robin and Sean to pull over and wait. No sooner than we pulled over than Sara and Brett shot by at about 130 km/h. By the time we got back on the road, they were gone. We assume they pulled into Banff.<br />
We did not &#8212; I gave up my Irish stew and Guinness for a Wendy&#8217;s double hamburger and lemonade. Not exactly what I would call a consolation prize &#8230; more like a booby prize.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a lot of fun. And I&#8217;d do it again. I just have to find seven half-suicidal people to go with me&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Be it ever so humble &#8230; and a little messy &#8230; there&#8217;s no place like home.<br />
I missed yesterday&#8217;s log. Oops. Basically, the testing went well &#8212; the changes I made held and so far, things are looking good. That meant I could finally come home. I had to make some near last-minute changes (extending my stay at the Westin, and telling Northwest that I&#8217;d be leaving the following day), but otherwise all was fine.<br />
Actually, the last-minute changes were a little more in my favour &#8212; I had to book an earlier flight because the one I wanted was full. That was fine with me &#8212; I was more interested in coming home.<br />
This morning was mostly involved with updating the testing pages on the staging server, letting the team know which files were &#8220;approved&#8221; and which ones still needed work, and letting them know how to find me. Then it was off to the airport.<br />
If you ever go to Cincinnati Airport, make sure you bring a book. There&#8217;s nothing to look at there, the airport&#8217;s rather dull, and there&#8217;s no store once you pass security. Kinda annoying, if you ask me. Of course, I could have gone back through, but I really couldn&#8217;t be bothered.<br />
I was writing. Not this, but a report that I have to file for what I did. Our client&#8217;s still a little edgy with this so-called solution, so I need to prove it with a nice lengthy document that no-one will read. Fortunately, I&#8217;m good at being verbose. These logs are a testament to that, if nothing else.<br />
I love first class, although I have to admit I feel a little guilty taking it. I know what it&#8217;s like to be peering from steerage into the plushly-furnished curtained area. Unlimited drinks (which admittedly, I didn&#8217;t take advantage of), nicer meals, and big, comfy seats. Very nice.<br />
The flight from Cincinnati to Minneapolis was about an hour and a half, before I got dumped there to catch a connecting flight. During that time I took the opportunity to recharge my laptop&#8217;s battery. It&#8217;s a long life battery, but I wanted it to last the remaining leg of the journey. Northwest doesn&#8217;t show in-flight movies on such &#8220;short haul&#8221; flights, and I had nothing to read. I figured I&#8217;d entertain myself with a report.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain how much I enjoyed seeing the Prairies again. Land that stretches out forever, where it&#8217;s rare that cloud covers everything, where the buffalo used to roam, and the deer and the antelope are hunted for fun.<br />
We passed over Drumheller on our way in (I was amazed that I could recognize it from the air), and sailed smoothly into Calgary. Being the second from the front of the plane, I was the second one off. However, I was the first into Customs, which I blitzed right through. I completely bypassed baggage claim (carry-ons &#8212; it&#8217;s the only way to fly), and tore out the front door. I grabbed the first taxi, and was on my way home.<br />
I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m much more adjusted to the western climate &#8212; it&#8217;s drier here, and I&#8217;m not a big fan of the oppressive humidity of the east. I was very happy not to be sweltering in the heat, and feeling a cool breeze for the first time in over a week.<br />
So if you&#8217;re ever living on the air in Cincinnati, don&#8217;t look for WKRP. It doesn&#8217;t exist. However, there is a WKRC.<br />
No kidding&#8230;</p>

		<p>Today was a good day. Finally.<br />
There&#8217;s nothing quite like the feeling of finally overcoming a problem that&#8217;s kept you up a night, sent you to perhaps the dullest city in mid-eastern America, had you eating mediocre food for a week, and put massive (albeit temporary) dents in your credit cards.<br />
It&#8217;s also good to know that I didn&#8217;t waste my weekend. The problems, not quite all, but most of them, are gone. All the work that I poured into this handy little laptop, not to mention some great backup from Calgary, solved our quandaries. The site&#8217;s working (mostly), and after tomorrow, we&#8217;ll be able to say that the site is solid, and I can finally go home.<br />
I met with John today. He&#8217;s our (Critical Mass&#8217;) account manager for our client. He&#8217;s not much older than me &#8212; I figure 30, tops. Probably from a business school. But he&#8217;s good with clients, and seems pretty good at fighting fires. He was here for his bi-monthly meeting with the client. He knows this city well.<br />
We had an interesting chat after work, over dinner at the Fifth and Vine, an eatery in the corner of the hotel. I gotta tell ya &#8212; he&#8217;s a great guy. He saw the client in pretty much the same way I do. Not to mention the contractors. I got a lot of positive feedback &#8212; he was glad I came. Although not the best candidate, I was good enough to convince some of the contractors that Critical Mass isn&#8217;t all pretty front-ends, and that we do know how to solve hard problems.<br />
Whether or not that keeps going is anyone&#8217;s guess&#8230;<br />
Tomorrow is coding and testing, and then I&#8217;m outta here on Thursday. With luck, I&#8217;ll be at work Friday morning.<br />
If I&#8217;m not, I might start looking for an apartment down here. It&#8217;ll certainly be cheaper than these hotels&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate this city. And Memorial Day. The two of them combined? Well, let me tell you&#8230;<br />
I figured I&#8217;d stay in today and get some work done. Fine, no problem. Or so I thought. I got up later than I&#8217;d planned (probably because I&#8217;d stayed up so late), and so skipped breakfast (which I&#8217;ve done almost every day since I got here). I figured that I&#8217;d make it up with a nice sub.<br />
So I thought.<br />
In Canada, whenever we have a holiday, it&#8217;s a good excuse to go shopping. I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; nearly everything that can be open is usually open. There are exceptions, but more often than not, you can at least find a restaurant, or a Subway, to get a meal.<br />
Not in Cincinnati.<br />
It&#8217;s locked down tighter than a drum. Even the bars are closed. What&#8217;s with that? Since when don&#8217;t Americans want to get drunk on a National Holiday? I thought that was a stereotype, for crying out loud!<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m annoyed.<br />
After wandering around downtown for about an hour, I found ONE open store or restaurant. Arby&#8217;s. I won&#8217;t touch Arby&#8217;s for all the roast beef in England. Can&#8217;t do it. Won&#8217;t do it. I hate Arby&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve eaten there twice, and hated it both times.<br />
So I figured I&#8217;d eat at one of the hotel&#8217;s restaurants. They closed at 1:50pm. They don&#8217;t open again until 5pm. What the heck kind of service is that??<br />
Oh yeah, there&#8217;s room service &#8230; if you want to pay US$15 for a lousy hamburger. For US$15, I can get a bottomless soft drink, a beer (a wheat beer, not some mega-swill), a huge gourmet hamburger (made to order) with cheese and bacon, fries, and a caesar salad. That&#8217;s at the Rock Bottom. I&#8217;d just as soon go there &#8230; but it&#8217;s closed.<br />
So I&#8217;m eating a Snickers bar and holding out until 6pm.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to go home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was my day off. It didn&#8217;t start that way &#8212; I was figuring on getting a lot of work in, but as I went out to scout for lunch, I decided that the day was nice enough that I would take a little walk. My logic says that if I take today off, I can work my keister off for the next 36 hours and still get the job done and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
In theory, at least.<br />
My goal was the Cincinnati Museum Center. It sounded like a really neat place to check out, and it was about the only thing in walking distance that I wanted to see.<br />
I walked up to 9th Street before heading west. Along the way, I passed examples of architecture from just about every period since the mid-to-late 1800s. Gerry would love this city.<br />
The weather was threatening rain, amidst bursts of sunshine. The forecast was for thunderstorms, but I never heard even so much as a slight rumble. Heck, it barely rained in the entire time I was walking about. Which was good, because I had neither an umbrella or a raincoat. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to go anywhere where I would be horribly out of place showing up soaked.<br />
According to the maps I&#8217;d read, all I had to do was cross I-75 on 9th Street, turn onto Gest Road, and walk up to Western Road. Unfortunately, maps seldom match reality. For starters, 9th Street doesn&#8217;t actually cross I-75 &#8212; 8th Street does. Although 8th Street doesn&#8217;t actually connect with the road that crosses I-75. Doesn&#8217;t make sense, does it? Well, considering the city has no movie theatres downtown and no stores open past 9pm (the Subway closes at 5pm on weekends!), it fits the pattern.<br />
When you get to the other side of the I-75, you&#8217;ll find that Gest doesn&#8217;t actually intersect with the road you&#8217;re walking on. It&#8217;s pseudo-parallel. And Western? I don&#8217;t think it meets Gest, either &#8230; although I could have just missed it without realizing.<br />
You can see the Cincinnati Museum Center even before you&#8217;ve reached the other side of the bridge. It&#8217;s that big. It took me about ten minutes to get there from the bridge, and when I got there, I realized that I had another five minutes of having to walk around so I could actually get in. (I came down towards the side, which has a road that goes under the parking lot.)<br />
The Cincinnati Museum Center is also known as Cincinnati Union Station. It was built in 1931 to handle the massive passenger rail traffic that used to run through the city. The station was huge. Its centre is a huge quarter sphere, with the flat side facing the front. The curved portion forms the massive rotunda of the complex. It&#8217;s a very dramatic art deco style. Gerry would love this building. So would Stuart, I think.<br />
I like the art deco style. I&#8217;d even go so far as to say I&#8217;m an art deco revivalist. Maybe it&#8217;s because I think the style is elegant, maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not concrete. Sometimes I think I long for the era that spawned art deco &#8212; the days when rail travel was king, when technology was the newest radio.<br />
Then again, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to write these logs as easily&#8230;<br />
The museum has four exhibits: The Cincinnati Museum in the south wing, the Natural History Museum in the north wing, the Children&#8217;s Museum in the &#8220;basement&#8221;, and an OmnIMAX theatre. Okay, &#8220;exhibits&#8221; is the wrong word &#8212; but museums sounds a little strange.<br />
Actually, there&#8217;s a fifth exhibit &#8212; the building itself. If you go on a weekend, you can get a free tour of Cincinnati Union Station &#8212; when it was railway station. They take you through the various sections that are still in the semi-original state. I caught a part of it when I was waiting in line for the OmnIMAX movie. More on that later.<br />
After purchasing my ticket, I went into the Cincinnati Museum. I figured that I could get through that before the movie at 4:00. The two wings used to be where vehicular traffic came through. It was a place for taxis and &#8220;motor coaches&#8221; (buses) to drop people off and pick people up. They arrived at the north wing (now the Natural History wing), drove under the main structure and picked people up on the south wing (now the Cincinnati Museum exhibit). The driveways are still visible, although now covered in grass.<br />
The first thing you notice when entering the Cincinnati Museum is a massive model of 1940s downtown Cincinnati. Some of the buildings are familiar &#8212; they still stand today. But many are gone, replaced by more modern (although not necessarily more attractive) buildings. One thing that&#8217;s very noticeable is the streetcars (taken out in the 1950s), and the railyard and warehousing district on the waterfront. Today, there are no rails down there, and the only buildings (aside from the highways) are Cinergy Field (home of the Cincinnati Reds) and a new stadium, currently under construction (the future home of the Cincinnati Reds).<br />
I spent about 15 minutes at the model, going through the interactive video, learning more about the city keeping my prisoner. It grew from the copious river traffic that flowed up and down the Ohio River. River travel was so important that the river boat captains wielded strong power over many decisions facing early Cincinnati.<br />
One of those decision was to build a bridge to neighbouring Newport, Kentucky. The captains didn&#8217;t like that idea &#8212; it would hinder their ability to monopolize freight and passenger traffic. But eventually it was built, although Cincinnati took three more years than its neighbour to grant permission. (Their excuse was potential loss of Cincinnati jobs and an increase in runaway slaves.)<br />
The bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, the same person who designed the Brooklyn Bridge. The John A. Roebling bridge, as it&#8217;s now known, is in fact the forefather of the Brooklyn Bridge. The design was later improved for its much more famous descendant.<br />
From there, I walked through a rather large exhibit about Cincinnati&#8217;s wartime efforts. They seem really proud of that. A little too proud, if you ask me. Of course, it might just be part of the Memorial Day festivities (there were vets all over the place).<br />
Then it was into ancient Cincinnati, starting from the arrival of Native Americans. One thing I learned early on was that Cincinnati, the order of officers for whom the city obtained its name, comes from Cincinnatus. Cincinnatus was a Roman general, who came from commoner stock. The officers of the Revolutionary War thought it was an appropriate name to give themselves (&#8220;Cincinnati&#8221; is Latin plural for &#8220;Cincinnatus&#8221;). So I guess in theory, a person from Cincinnati is a Cincinnatus. Hmm, I wonder&#8230;<br />
The exhibit was really quite fascinating. They covered the period of western encroachment into Ohio, from the first explorers, to the founding of Losantiville, the founding of Fort Washington, the Miami Purchase (don&#8217;t ask me what that was &#8212; the Americans seem obsessed with &#8220;purchases&#8221;, and the rising of the modern city that I can&#8217;t seem to escape.<br />
One of the neater parts of the exhibit was a 3/4 scale model of a steamboat, complete with part of original downtown Cincinnati. The exhibit stopped around the turn of the 20th century.<br />
By that time, I thought I should head up, so I wouldn&#8217;t miss the movie. I was about 40 minutes early, so I just camped out around the door. Soon, the tour of Cincinnati Union Station came by. At first, I didn&#8217;t know what it was, but I was offered to join. So I did.<br />
The first stop (for me, and also the last) was at the Amtrak station. Yes, there is an actual operating Amtrak station in this museum. Apparently, the rail travel still has to go through here. Kinda neat, eh?<br />
Once upon a time, it used to be the Men&#8217;s Waiting Room. (There was also a Women&#8217;s Waiting Room.) It featured a lounge, showers (baths for women), smoking room &#8212; everything you needed to freshen up (or wait) for your train. Today, the women&#8217;s room is gone &#8212; it&#8217;s now storage, the showers have been taken out and the door removed, and the decor is plastic overlay instead of wood. But it still features the original flooring and art deco lights.<br />
When we exited the room, the line-up for the movie had grown considerably. I opted to not follow the rest, as I wanted a good seat (this is crucial in an IMAX film).<br />
The movie was &#8220;Amazon&#8221;, and is perhaps one of the better IMAX movies I&#8217;ve seen. It tells the story of how two completely different civilizations (Western, and of the many that live in and around the Amazon basin) look to the Amazon with the same purpose in mind &#8212; saving lives. It didn&#8217;t preach heavily, but it didn&#8217;t really have to &#8212; the need to preserve the Amazon was quite clear. It was the first IMAX movie I&#8217;ve seen that made me queasy. Of course, that might have been due to lack of food.<br />
After lunch, I caved in a bought a disposable camera. I wanted a pictures of the building &#8212; it&#8217;s too nice not to take pictures. Besides, I want to scan them and put them up for all to see.<br />
Afterwards, I went through the Natural History wing. Not nearly as interesting as the Cincinnati Museum, but then again, I knew most of this. They had a few things that I didn&#8217;t expect to see &#8212; a mock-up of a cave (similar to Mammoth Cave, about three hours from here), and a mock-up of a glacier (which according to the museum, stopped just short of here during the last ice age).<br />
The animals that lived here during that time were fascinating. I had never seen a skeleton, let alone a recreation, of a giant beaver. About three times the size of a normal beaver, this beastie could probably have taken down entire trees with a single bite. Big, sharp, pointy teeth.<br />
I left around 5:45, heading back towards downtown. This time I went down Ezzard Charles Drive to Central Parkway, before heading south. I went all the way down to 3rd Street, where I walked over to the John A. Roebling bridge. (One of the weird conditions about building the bridge was that it was not allowed to be in line with any existing Cincinnati streets).<br />
I walked towards the bridge until I got to a staircase that allowed me to get down to the Ohio River. From there, I got a good enough angle to take pictures of the bridge. I returned to the bridge to take a picture from its deck.<br />
Returning to Fountain Square, I partook in a late dinner at the Rock Bottom Brewery again. I was relieved to finally get off my feet &#8212; I&#8217;d been walking for hours, and was quite tired at that point.<br />
Then it was back to my room, and back to work. But at least I got part of a day off.</p>

		<p>Ugh.<br />
It never fails. I get a long weekend, I get lousy weather. I had hoped to go to the Cincinnati Museum today, but the weather kept me indoors. Okay, that sounds like a really stupid statement &#8212; if I&#8217;m going to a museum, why would I care what the weather&#8217;s like?<br />
I want to walk there &#8212; I&#8217;m a little tired of taxis, and I could use the exercise. But it rained for most of the day. It didn&#8217;t clear up until later in the afternoon. A good thing, since I wanted to go out for dinner tonight.<br />
I spent the day working, fixing our client&#8217;s website. I watched movies and coded. I&#8217;m amazed at how much work I got done watching &#8220;Meet Joe Black&#8221;. You really can work for huge periods of time and not miss much in that movie. On the opposite view, I didn&#8217;t get much done during &#8220;The Highlander&#8221;.<br />
Importantly, though, I had breakthroughs. I only wish I were actually in the office to put my theories to the test. But I have to wait until Tuesday. Our client doesn&#8217;t like having strangers run amok in the offices unescorted.<br />
My first meal in Cincinnati that wasn&#8217;t a sub was at the Rock Bottom Brewery, a brew pub in Fountain Square, pretty much right across the street from the Westin. I don&#8217;t much like going to places like that on my own, but I didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice. Besides, Nancy (my project manager) more or less ordered me to get out for dinner at least one night this weekend.<br />
Tomorrow &#8212; more rain. Hence, more work. But Monday&#8217;s supposed to be nice. If I get enough done, I&#8217;ll make an effort to get out and see what I can find. Besides, I&#8217;ll need the air by that point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another day, another hotel. Owing to some strange reason, there seem to be a lot of people coming to Cincinnati. Can&#8217;t really figure out why.<br />
The Omni was completely booked for today when my room was booked on Tuesday. So I moved the next block over to the Westin. Larger room, better bed. Lousier TV selection, though. Oh well, I guess there are trade offs&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m definitely here for the long run. Probably won&#8217;t be escaping this place until Wednesday at the earliest. We&#8217;ve got problems that really have no explanation. Rather annoying, if you ask me. Today was about as effective as Wednesday and Thursday. This weekend is all mine, though. I&#8217;m going to rebuild parts of the site that the contractors did a number on. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t blame them &#8212; completely, anyway &#8212; they did what they had to do. Unfortunately, they aren&#8217;t the best coders in the world when it comes to HTML.<br />
My task this weekend is to correct all the mistakes. Not just theirs, but ours. We (Critical Mass) sent a few files that had a few discrepancies in style. Not a good thing. So I&#8217;m going to spend a lot of time going through every file in the site. There&#8217;s a few, but luckily, not a lot. If I had to do this for, say, the Mercedes Benz site, I&#8217;d be spending the better part of a month doing that.<br />
After work, I took the time to wander through part of downtown Cincinnati. It&#8217;s an interesting city, if only for its idiosyncracities. Its architecture is &#8230; well &#8230; interesting. (Seeing as the city&#8217;s &#8220;interesting&#8221;, I guess that goes hand-in-hand.) The buildings in downtown Cincinnati have more variance in styles than any city I&#8217;ve lived in. This is probably because Cincinnati&#8217;s been around a while, and gone through a lot of changes.<br />
The town of Losantisville was founded in 1788 on the shores of the Ohio River. Two years later, Northwest Territory Commander General Arthur St. Clair renamed the town Cincinnati, in honour of the Society of Cincinnati, an officers&#8217; organization from the Revolutionary War.<br />
Cincinnati&#8217;s location is the nexus of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. This made it a central location for commerce, which naturally attracted people. The mid-1800s saw Cincinnati&#8217;s population grow by 40 percent as a flood newcomers, mostly German immigrants. Steamboat trade and the explosion of the pork-packing industry led to Cincinnati&#8217;s role as the &#8220;Queen City of the West&#8221;. For a time, it was the nation&#8217;s sixth largest city and third-largest manufacturing centre.<br />
Today, the industry that built Cincinnati is gone. In its place are Fortune 500 companies and a lot of smaller companies. The massive factories are gone, or subdivided by smaller companies. The downtown core is completely commercial, which explains its death in the evenings (and my boredom).<br />
Because of Cincinnati&#8217;s past, it has a very interesting present &#8230; at least from an architectural perspective. Most of the buildings downtown are either modern (built within the past 20 years), or from the 1920s to 1940s. There are a few edifices from the 50s, 60s, and 70s &#8212; they&#8217;re not too hard to spot. (Although the Federal Reserve, built in 1972, is quite nice.) Old buildings are well preserved, and easy to find.<br />
Not easy to find are Cincinnati&#8217;s mistakes, and they&#8217;ve made a couple biggies. One of the more interesting ones is Cincinnati&#8217;s attempt at a subway system. The City made the attempt, starting in the 1920s using leftovers from a canal system. A large portion of the system was completed before the Depression brought the project to a screeching halt. Lack of funds and a general trend towards automobile traffic eventually led the subway into abandonment. The tunnels are used for storage, the half-built stations boarded up. Today, hardly anything exists.<br />
Tomorrow, I intend to check out the Cincinnati Museum, an old art deco railway station converted into a museum. But that&#8217;s just part of the day &#8212; the rest will be work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m trapped. Metaphorically speaking, that is.<br />
Today, I effectively did nothing. I spent the day trying to solve problems, but not really accomplishing anything. I started off with a conference call with Critical Mass and a few representatives of our client. We were reviewing the situation I&#8217;ve been dealing with since I arrived.<br />
The meeting wasn&#8217;t too long, and afterwards I felt that those involved had a clearer picture of the situation. This was important from my perspective, since I wasn&#8217;t too sure whether my superiors were wholly confident on sending me down in the first place. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m not trying to blow smoke. But considering my lack of progress, I had to make sure that the others understood that I know what I&#8217;m doing &#8230; sort of.<br />
My major problem is that there&#8217;s nothing I can do directly &#8212; I have to ask others to do it. And if those others aren&#8217;t interested in helping me, well, then I look like a bit of a putz. Not much I can do about it, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
I struggled through the day, doing what I can, until conference call #2 in the afternoon. Same client, different project. This is the one I started on my second day at Critical Mass. It just so happened that I happened to be in Cincinnati when they needed someone. Convenient, non?<br />
Tomorrow&#8217;s the start of the long weekend here. It basically means that not much work will be done. And considering the past two days of relative inactivity, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m making it out on Sunday. Not unless all the problems disappear tomorrow, and there&#8217;s a chance I can get in on the weekend. I know snowballs that have better chances than that&#8230;<br />
After work here is dull without something to do. I&#8217;ve spent the past couple of hours watching TV. Luckily for me, I get TBS &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen Enter The Dragon all the way through. First time for everything, I guess. After this is Rumble In The Bronx with Jackie Chan. I suppose Cincinnati isn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
If you can stay in your hotel room all the time, that is.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My alarm went off early this morning. I rose somewhat slowly (I hadn&#8217;t quite adjusted to the time zone), but eventually found my way into the shower. That woke me up enough to get dressed, shave, and prepare my notes for this morning.<br />
First stop was breakfast. Continental was served in the spacious (and opulent) dining area on the lobby floor. I found out shortly thereafter that I&#8217;d be far better off not eating &#8212; at nearly $18, I was quite relieved to know that I could expense it.<br />
I returned quickly to my room to call Corey, my contact at the client site. Corey works for the backend consultant, and would be one of the people I would be working with. I dug out his number and dialled his mobile phone. He asked that I call back &#8212; he was apparently still in transit. On the second call, he gave me directions to the building where I&#8217;d be wreaking havoc trying to fix a broken system.<br />
I&#8217;m working in a small team, all of whom have been slaving away on the installation since February. I feel sorry for them &#8212; given the amount of frustration I felt today alone, I can understand why they don&#8217;t smile a lot.<br />
It took most of the day before I began to understand what was going on. It wasn&#8217;t anything that we (Critical Mass) had done with our code. Nor was it anything that the consultants had done. It was, or at least seemed to be, the server. The software we needed didn&#8217;t appear to be correct. Simple HTML codes were being garbled.<br />
So, problem solved and I get to go home, right? Not quite. There&#8217;s a lot of things that are still unresolved &#8212; most notably the issue of whether or not the server is actually the problem. We don&#8217;t know. I came to that conclusion based on results we were getting from the server and my knowledge of how these things (usually) work. The consultants liked my answer, mostly because they were having so many problems, my hypothesis would explain a large part of it. However, I have yet to put it through the scientific process.<br />
After work, I trudged my way back to the hotel. It was hot. It was humid. I&#8217;d forgotten what it was like &#8212; I&#8217;ve been gone from the East for so long, the sudden rise in temperature (and subsequent decrease in comfort) was a little surprising.<br />
What wasn&#8217;t surprising was the city. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but Cincinnati feels and smells like &#8230; well, an American city. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s the same acrid diesel-infused stench (thankfully not strong) of an industrial city. Which is odd, since Cincinnati isn&#8217;t quite as industrial as it used to be.<br />
Returning to my room, I quickly changed into shorts, and proceeded to figure out what I would do. The answer was quick (and somewhat obvious, at least to those who know me) &#8212; a movie. Specifically, Mission: Impossible 2. (Critical Mass *had* to send me in opening week&#8230;) The hard part was finding a place that actually had the movie.<br />
There are no movie theatres in downtown Cincinnati. I don&#8217;t know why. Makes no sense. The nearest theatre is five miles away &#8230; straight-line distance. It&#8217;s about 10 miles, once you count in all the turns and zigzags. It costs about US$14. So why did I bother? Well, simply put, there ain&#8217;t a heck of a lot to do in downtown Cincinnati.<br />
The taxi driver had no idea where the Showcase Cinema was. I only knew that it was off of Route 562. The driver took off in that direction, while I attempted to narrow down the search. The major problem was that we had no real address, and for the second time since I got here, my cell phone didn&#8217;t want to dial. (A note for you Clearnet users &#8212; it has problems roaming in the States.)<br />
We headed up I-71, looking for the turn-off onto Route 562. The driver&#8217;s instinct took over and he left the highway shortly after turning onto Route 562, into a subdivision. We pulled into a BP station, where he quickly got directions. A scarce five minutes later, we arrived at the Showcase Cinemas.<br />
It was worth it, at least in my opinion. Certainly better than watching TV in my suite all night. And yes, the taxi was expensive, but since I ate about US$5 of food today, and will probably do same tomorrow, it&#8217;ll all eventually balance out.<br />
I hope&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long day.<br />
It all started about a week ago. One of our clients, whom I&#8217;m afraid I cannot mention, had a problem with the website we developed for them. Actually, it wasn&#8217;t the client so much as it was our so-called partner in crime.<br />
Critical Mass typically designs the front-end &#8212; all the pretty pictures and clicky things &#8212; of a website. Typically, someone else does the back-end &#8212; all the junk that deals with the ecommerce and database. This isn&#8217;t our idea &#8212; it&#8217;s usually the client&#8217;s. We don&#8217;t much cotton to that process; it lends to more problems than it&#8217;s worth. That&#8217;s how I ended up here in Cincinnati.<br />
We provided one of our stunning works of art to the client, who then turned it over to the backend developers (whom, again, I cannot mention). The firm is large, and we assumed technically savvy. We should know better.<br />
They fubared the site. Lemme back up &#8212; they tried to merge our site with their backend, and then claimed that our &#8220;monkey s&#8211;t JavaScript&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a load of bally-hoo &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t have shipped it if it didn&#8217;t work. Then we got the email that drove most of us in Web Development off the deep end&#8230;<br />
We develop our sites with the most recent developments in HTML, including JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). One of our favourite tricks is to build everything in &#8220;layers&#8221; &#8212; small pieces we can stack on top of each other. It makes the site very flexible. This technique is what was causing the backend consultants grief.<br />
The backend (using a system called Dynamo) wasn&#8217;t working with our layers (specifically, a tag called a &#8220;DIV&#8221;). So they decided that we could no longer develop using DIV tags, and had to build everything with tables. Uhhhhh, no.<br />
We thought this was a load of crock from the moment we first heard it. We knew that our code was solid &#8212; we&#8217;d built several sites using Dynamo and DIVs, and never had a problem. So we told them that. They didn&#8217;t exactly listen. I wrote up a small quasi-manifesto (with some contributions from Adile, my partner in crime in my first project at Critical Mass). I figure that&#8217;s how I ended up here.<br />
On Friday, just after lunch, Nancy (the account manager for this particular client) drew me aside and asked if I would go to Cincinnati and clear this mess up. Big responsibility. No, I wasn&#8217;t the best choice &#8212; there are others in the company who were far better suited to this problem &#8212; but I was the best choice of the available people.<br />
Simply put, there were about five people Nancy would have sent. Two were far too tied up on projects to pull off. One was, well, we were worried that they would back down and give into the consultant&#8217;s demands to convert the entire site to tables. Another would have been ideal, but would probably get into too many arguments to be truly effective. That left me. Being between projects, and having some experience with Dynamo and DIVs, I got fingered to go.<br />
This morning, I was running around like a madman, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible. The flight still hadn&#8217;t been booked (nor the hotel), I hadn&#8217;t packed (owing to a lack of a suitably-sized duffel bag), I needed to set up email forwarding, get files copied to the laptop (which had only just returned from Cincinnati), I had to square away rent (just in case I don&#8217;t get back before the beginning of the month), and I had to pay a couple of bills. All that before 11:00.<br />
I left at 11:40 for the airport. The flight was at 2:05 on Northwest Airlines. I would fly from Calgary to Minneapolis/St. Paul, where I&#8217;d catch a connecting flight to Cincinnati. (Oh the joys of the airline hub.) I arrived at Calgary airport in sufficient time to check-in and get lunch.<br />
I&#8217;ve never flown Northwest before. I don&#8217;t like American airlines in general, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having to take one. But when given no choice, you take what you&#8217;re given. That&#8217;s why when I found out that my ticket automatically upgraded me to First Class, I didn&#8217;t refuse.<br />
I didn&#8217;t check any bags &#8212; I prefer not to, just so I don&#8217;t have to deal with baggage pick-up at the other end. Customs was fun. The game was &#8220;Let&#8217;s See If We Can Freak Geoff Out&#8221;. The questions came fast and hard, and I responded just as quickly. Then I goofed. When asked for the duration of my stay, I said I hoped to return on Sunday. &#8220;Hoped.&#8221; Bad choice of word. This brought up a whole issue of why I wouldn&#8217;t be coming back on Sunday. That escalated into the purpose of my visit, and what exactly was I doing there. I figured it would snowball into &#8220;Why can&#8217;t an American do this?&#8221; &#8212; luckily, it didn&#8217;t.<br />
The flight was late, by about 30 minutes or so. Soon we were called, and I walked down the gangway to our DC-9. I can&#8217;t tell you the last time I&#8217;d flown in a DC-9, only that it&#8217;s been a very long time. I had 3C, and the adjoining 3A, all to myself. Wow. Big seats. Nice service. Free booze. Too bad I&#8217;m trying not to drink (I get dehydrated enough as it is on planes without having alcohol).<br />
It was about three hours to Minneapolis. During the time, we were served lunch &#8212; a chicken sandwich. But in First Class, the sandwich is nice and hot, with yummy cheese and grilled peppers. It comes with a nice little salad, and an Italian rolled ice cream ball.<br />
I like First Class.<br />
You also get a GLASS glass for your drink, instead of some goofy plastic cup. It really does make a difference.<br />
We arrived in Minneapolis around 5:45pm (local time). I was supposed to go to Gate 7, where I&#8217;d catch my connecting flight at 7:00. So of course, we came in at Gate 64. Figures. I hiked across the airport (and boy, is it a big airport), and found my way to Gate 7. There, I plunked myself down, and continued to teach myself Dynamo. (Not having a manual makes it kinda hard.)<br />
Around 6:30, I began to wonder why Gate 7 didn&#8217;t have any sign up for my flight. Gate 8, which was leaving for Green Bay at 7:15, had its sign up before I got there. I started to wonder. So I asked.<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Yeah, your flight is leaving from Gate Sev&#8230; er, they&#8217;ve moved it.&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;Where to?&#8221; (I already knew the answer. Murphy was standing right behind me.)<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Gate 82.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8212; I&#8217;m glad that I started working out (although I&#8217;ve been a little lax in the past week or two). By the time I got to Gate 82, I was winded. Of course, I was hiking at a serious pace to get there on time.<br />
Flight 8530 was being operated by Mesaba Airlines. I haven&#8217;t heard of &#8217;em, either. Frankly, that worried me, too. But as it turns out, they just operate Northwest&#8217;s regional flights. Supposedly, Cincinnati is regional from Minneapolis.<br />
We flew an RJ-45, er, 85 (sorry, techie joke there). I&#8217;ve never heard of an RJ-85, I don&#8217;t even know who built the silly thing. It looks kind of like a cross between a Harrier Jumpjet and a 747. Very strange. Holds about 69 people. Flies like a kite &#8212; sways all over the bloody place.<br />
The meal was another sandwich &#8212; turkey, this time. No ice cream, though. We got a gourmet cookie instead. Whee. This time I had a rowmate, a guy from Cisco Systems. We engaged in hearty conversation in the last 20 minutes or so of the flight, recounting our views of Digital Equipment, and how we realized that they were doomed long before Compaq bought &#8217;em out.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten how humid it gets out here (in the East, that is). Calgary is dry &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking through a lake out here (comparatively speaking, of course). I sweltered the entire way downtown to the Omni Netherlands.<br />
Nathan, who&#8217;d only recently returned to Calgary from here, complained that the Omni&#8217;s rooms were &#8220;small&#8221;. I could easily hold a small concert in my room. I hate to know what he thinks &#8220;big&#8221; is.<br />
Well, I&#8217;m off to bed now. I&#8217;ve got a long day tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. It&#8217;s going to be a long week&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My time here in Calgary is finite. I&#8217;m not staying here forever. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like this city &#8212; but there&#8217;s more to this planet than a single settlement near the foot of the Canadian Rockies.<br />
When I first arrived here in Calgary, most you all received a message from me letting you know what had just happened. One of the replies struck me with a fair bit of interest, partly because at that point I was a little bewildered with what I&#8217;d done, and my sensibilities were left behind in Vancouver, and partly because I was feeling quite a bit of exhilaration from being free. It went something like this:<br />
&#8220;So. Now you have your life ahead of you. [&#8230;] Let me extend the very sincere invitation to accompany me to go to Japan. Yes, I am being serious. [&#8230;] Besides the fact that we are english speaking north americans [sic], we have computer skills too, which adds up to equal a [&#8230;] load of money for us (and a lot of REALLY good stories to tell our friends). [&#8230;] If I had to share a 4&#215;4 shoebox with anybody, you would be a good choice.&#8221;<br />
This was from my friend Chris, whom I&#8217;ve known since the first day in Mr. Gettsinger&#8217;s Grade 10 Math class. Stuart, Chris, and I had been mostly inseparable through high school (Stuart and I shared a locker for most of high school). Chris and I have the same birthday (we still haven&#8217;t figured out who&#8217;s actually the elder, though given the odds, it&#8217;s probably Chris &#8212; I was born towards the last quarter of the day). We share a mutual love of movies (as do several of our other friends), and a twisted sense of humour.<br />
Now we share an apartment. This is part of our Master Plan. In a little over a year, the two of us are going to Japan. For Chris, this is to satisfy his obsession with all things Japanese. For me, this is to satisfy my curiosity. Sounds like a little much to go through for curiosity, doesn&#8217;t it? Don&#8217;t blame me &#8212; blame my grandmother.<br />
Beatrice Sowrey travelled all around the world, visiting every continent (except Antarctica) before she died in late 1995. She seemed to have a gene that made her want to travel and see things. She passed that gene to my father, who with my mother, has been around quite a lot. That gene is now in my blood. Although I haven&#8217;t been to as many places as my predecessors, that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t have the urge.<br />
That&#8217;s what Chris being here is all about. This is Phase 1. We&#8217;re going to be here for a year, to pay bills and save money. Then we&#8217;re off to Japan. Calgary is a convenient location &#8212; cheap rent, reasonably good salaries, close proximity to Vancouver (the &#8220;Gateway to the Pacific&#8221;).<br />
Phase 1 started Saturday, when I got up to watch cartoons. Okay, not right then, but shortly thereafter, when I got down to cleaning the apartment. Top to bottom &#8212; vacuumed, swept, mopped, and rearranged. Everything was ready for Chris&#8217; arrival.<br />
His plane landed around 5:45pm, about the time I got to the airport (his flight was early). Stuart and Therese were already there, ready to meet Chris with me. (In my later-than-planned arrival, I ended up calling Stuart on the cell phone trying to make sure I was in the right place, only to end up looking right at him while talking on the cell phone. Doh.)<br />
After picking up his bags, I hauled him to his new home for a while. We would meet up with Therese and Stuart afterwards at Therese&#8217;s friend Janine&#8217;s, where she was holding a house-warming party for her new abode.<br />
The party consisted of about 10 people, a little over half of whom I knew. It was a somewhat subdued affair, where we all sat around, ate and drank (some more than others). After a while, the younger ones in the crowd (of whom, I&#8217;m sorry to say, I ain&#8217;t one) spoke up, wanting to go out clubbing.<br />
Janine&#8217;s place is not even a block from the club strip on 4th Street. It didn&#8217;t take long to find a place. Only that after a few minutes, we began to wonder if we&#8217;d all make it in. Chris and I, opting more for comfort than style, were wearing clothes that we suspected the bouncer would reject as not &#8220;trendy enough&#8221;. (Yeah, I know, this sounds really weird for Calgary &#8230; I guess it happens everywhere.)<br />
Stop #2 was at Cherry, a club not far away. Small &#8230; really small. Somewhat claustrophobic. We wandered around a little and tried to talk above the &#8220;music&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t long before most of us disappeared onto the dance floor. Stuart, Therese, and I opted to hang back in the upper decks, watching the crowd below.<br />
That&#8217;s when things started to go wrong for me. I started feeling angry. Really angry. To the point where I was ready to beat something (or someone) into a pulp. It was unsettling, to say the least. I couldn&#8217;t stop it.<br />
Luckily, I had my psychologist next to me, who promptly tried to help me through it. It didn&#8217;t help much. I was a little too unravelled at that moment to be coherent, let alone fully conscious of what was going on. I nearly broke down into tears. I hate mood swings.<br />
The rest of the night, I didn&#8217;t feel right. I didn&#8217;t feel right until late Sunday, when something finally clicked. I was lying in bed, trying to find the root of my anxieties. All weekend, since Chris arrived, I&#8217;d been feeling uptight, nervous, defensive. Like a light going on in the room, I suddenly knew why.<br />
I&#8217;m cohabitating again.<br />
All the pain that I&#8217;d been accumulating for the past two years was working it&#8217;s way back. I was thinking of Chris in the same way I&#8217;d thought of Allison. Bad &#8230; very, very bad. I actually had to remind myself that Chris is my roommate and one of my best friends. Not someone I had run away from.<br />
I haven&#8217;t had a roommate since 1996. At least not one where I could go off and do my own thing, and no-one else cared. So I have some adjustments to make. They&#8217;ll come. Realizing what was wrong has certainly helped.<br />
In the meantime, Chris and I are getting ourselves settled &#8212; Chris is getting a job, and I&#8217;m getting used to having someone else around all the time &#8212; and then we&#8217;ll start the arduous process of figuring out how the heck to get to the other side of the Pacific.<br />
But we&#8217;ve got a year to figure that out.<br />
In the meantime, I&#8217;m getting myself ready &#8212; I&#8217;m preparing for the inevitable culture shock, and getting my website overhauled.<br />
The culture shock is the hard one. I watched &#8220;Ghost In The Shell&#8221; the other night &#8212; it&#8217;s a Japanese adult animated movie &#8212; a genre often referred to as &#8220;anime&#8221;. (I say &#8220;adult&#8221; because it&#8217;s not for kids &#8212; there&#8217;s swearing, violence, and yes, even some nudity. But it&#8217;s a good movie &#8212; Gene Siskel gave it &#8220;thumbs up&#8221;.)<br />
Now, it&#8217;s not the best way to experience Japan (that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re going there), but if you let yourself sink into the environment of the movie (which isn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; there&#8217;s a few slow points), you can get even a partial idea of what you&#8217;re going to see.<br />
That scared me.<br />
I was actually *frightened*. I have no idea why. Usually these things get me excited. I think it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not just going to a different country, I&#8217;m going to a different culture, a different language, and an entirely different alphabet. (Yeah, I know that sounds kinda dumb &#8212; the Soviet Union had a different alphabet, too, but at least it transferred to the phonetic alphabet without too much difficulty.)<br />
The obvious question is &#8212; am I afraid to go to Japan? The answer is &#8220;no&#8221;. I think it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m looking at a culture that, really, I know little about. In order to know a culture, you have to immerse yourself in it. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going. I think it&#8217;s the fear of being an outsider (which we&#8217;ll be &#8212; no amount of preparation will counter that) that gave me the jitters. Hopefully that&#8217;s something that will go away with time.<br />
As for my website, well, that&#8217;s to be expected (me overhauling again, that is), isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m a ways from releasing it &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of work to do before I can put it up. And it&#8217;s not all going to be done right away &#8212; I&#8217;m eventually putting the whole thing in a database, and that&#8217;ll take a while before it&#8217;s ready. Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I&#8217;ll let you know when I release it.<br />
In the meantime, you can look at another piece of my work. No, nothing I&#8217;ve done for Critical Mass (yet &#8212; I have to wait for those sites to be launched), but something I&#8217;ve done for a friend: <a href="http://www.deskcam.net/">http://www.deskcam.net</a>.<br />
One of my Radical friends created a cool little application that captures images from web-based cameras and puts it on your desktop. You can even make little (or large) movies from it. Very slick little app.<br />
There, that&#8217;s my commercial plug for the day. Hmm&#8230; maybe I should look for corporate sponsorship&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend saw the first league tournament of the season. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out why we had a tournament so early in the year (we&#8217;ve had TWO regular season games so far, both on the same day). But I wasn&#8217;t about to turn down the ability to go out and get some more practice.<br />
Goodness knows I need it.<br />
Our first game was Friday evening up in the Northeast at Lester B. Pearson High School (a bare hop-skip-and-jump from my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s), against a team called the Screwballs. Oddly enough, of the three games we played this weekend, theirs is the only one whose name I remember.<br />
We almost had to forfeit due to lack of players. It wasn&#8217;t a problem of not enough women, we didn&#8217;t have enough guys. Luckily, the rest showed up just as we started the game. It was a chilly evening, so I was quite happy to play right field, where I would be at least somewhat mobile.<br />
The first inning went more-or-less uneventful &#8212; no major screwups on our part, no major offensive on their part. The second inning brought my first at bat. Memories of our first two games hung heavily with me. I was dreading another strike out. I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get to a batting cage (and so I&#8217;ve found out since then, they ain&#8217;t cheap, so I&#8217;ll be going sparingly when I actually get around to going). I was, shall we say, apprehensive.<br />
Looking at the selection of bats, I noticed that there was a new bat. I&#8217;d tried all the previous three bats, all without success. I figured that I couldn&#8217;t possibly do any worse with the new bat.<br />
The first pitch looked good. Figuring that I was going to miss it anyway, I swung. A peculiar feeling vibrated through the bat handle a fraction of a moment later, and I found myself wondering what just happened. I looked up to see a small off-white sphere sailing away from where the bat had just been. The now-familiar &#8220;plack!&#8221; sound the ball usually made when it landed on the mat was not to be heard. Using my powerful deductive reasoning, I came to the (rather surprising) conclusion that I&#8217;d actually hit the ball.<br />
Who &#8216;da thunk it?<br />
That&#8217;s when I heard the voices. &#8220;Run!&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t my team yelling at me &#8212; it was the ones in my head. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone insane. I&#8217;ll explain in a moment.) I bolted to first as fast as my legs, which clearly weren&#8217;t ready for the sudden motion, could take me. There was no way I was going to make it to second, so I held tight.<br />
Needless to say, I was rather amazed with myself. Not so much that it was a good hit (it passed over the shortstop&#8217;s outstretched (with a good jump) glove by mere inches), but that I hit it at all. Little did I know what was happening to me.<br />
(I would hit every single time at bat for the rest of the weekend &#8212; only once would I not make it to base. Every time, it was with that bat &#8212; a Louisville Slugger. I love that bat.)<br />
The inning ended, sadly, with me stranded on second. Well, I was on my way to third, but the batter was caught out.<br />
Returning to right field, I began to sit back into waiting. Right field, especially in this league, is quiet. Not much happens out there. (Now that I&#8217;ve said that, I&#8217;ll be inundated with pop flies for the rest of the season.)<br />
The first batter up collided with the ball sort of like a Howitzer &#8230; into right field. (He was a lefty, it was half-expected.) Last year, I missed a lot of these shots. For some reason, I was always too short. (Short as in I wasn&#8217;t far enough out in the field.) I could see the ball arcing towards me, and all I kept thinking was: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna miss this.&#8221;<br />
Then I heard the voices.<br />
&#8220;Take a couple steps back.&#8221;<br />
So I did. Suddenly, I realized that I was under it. I adjusted my footing so that I was right under it. Next thing I knew, the ball was in my glove. I paused a brief moment until the shock wore off. I threw the ball to the second baser, but there was no rush &#8212; there were no other runners.<br />
While I waited for the next batter, I stood there trying to figure out what the heck had just happened. I was puzzled beyond belief.<br />
You see, I&#8217;d heard the voices before. On last Monday&#8217;s games, I kept hearing things like &#8220;Run&#8221;, &#8220;Hold up&#8221;, &#8220;Bend and scoop&#8221;, and &#8220;Stab at the ball&#8221;. Yet no-one on my team was telling me these things.<br />
At first, I thought it was just me. But standing out there in right field, one gets a fair bit of time to think, reflect, self search, and wonder. In that inning, I had an epiphany. Like being broad-sided with a battleship, I abruptly realized what was happening. I didn&#8217;t have (and still don&#8217;t have) a mentor on the team. But I don&#8217;t need one &#8212; I&#8217;ve got my mentors from last year. Every word of advice they ever told me is coming back.<br />
It&#8217;s sort of like when you make a stew or chili. If you try and eat it right away, it&#8217;s okay, but not great. You have to let it sit and let all the flavours blend. During the six-plus months off, all the advice I got starting sinking in. Like someone turning a light on in a dark room, I knew where the voices were coming from.<br />
As you can guess, I was quite happy to figure this out &#8230; I was beginning to worry for a while.<br />
Now this hasn&#8217;t turned me into Sammy Sosa &#8212; but I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m playing significantly better than last year. Either that, or the team (and the league) is significantly worse than last year&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Despite my apparent improvement, we were unable to defeat our opposing team. However, we lost by only a couple of runs. This, believe it or not, is a very positive thing. It showed that despite only one practice (which I missed) and two games (one of which we one), we weren&#8217;t doing too badly.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop us from engaging in another practice. Those of us who weren&#8217;t in a rush to take off stuck around for an impromptu ball-catching session. The voices kept telling me what to do (&#8220;Dive&#8221;, &#8220;Step Back&#8221;, &#8220;Run In&#8221;, &#8220;LOOK OUT!!&#8221;), and I kept catching the balls. It was almost like someone had me on remote control. It was actually kinda creepy.<br />
My alarm went off at 6:00 the following morning. I ignored it until the second alarm went off at 6:30. Because we&#8217;d lost the previous night, our first game was at 8:00 at the Deerfoot Athletic Park at Deerfoot and 16th Ave NW.<br />
One look out the window told me what it wasn&#8217;t going to be a warm day. It looked cold. There was no reason for me to think that, but it looked cold. Sure enough, a check of the thermometer (on TV) told me that it was cold &#8212; it was definitely a morning for sweats.<br />
I arrived at the field not long after Ken, our coach. We found our field, and started to wait for the rest of the team. They slowly started accumulating after a little while, the rest of us shivering in the cold. When the equipment finally arrived, several of us immediately began warming up.<br />
The sun poked into the field about 20 minutes after we started, and as the right fielder, I was in a prime position to take its full warmth. Even then, I was still cold. It wasn&#8217;t until after a couple of innings that I was warm enough to even unzip the collar on my sweatshirt.<br />
The game was tough and tight &#8212; we were about evenly matched. Except that we were one player short. We need 10 people on a team (the tenth person is a &#8220;rover&#8221;, someone who can run throughout the outfield, supporting the other fielders). We had only nine. This meant we had to take an automatic out every rotation of the batting order. It was a shortage that would cost us dearly.<br />
Tight as the game was, we came up two runs short. And no, the final score wasn&#8217;t 2-0. It was 10-8. That&#8217;s how well we played. Hearing voices in my head was becoming a handy thing to have.<br />
Our next game wasn&#8217;t until 12:30, so I opted to head downtown and do some work. Not real work, of course, but something for fun. I&#8217;m developing a website for a good friend of mine, who has a very cool product. It gets launched next Monday &#8212; maybe I&#8217;ll let you know! I was a little behind on my work on that, so I figured I&#8217;d make use of the downtime and start plugging away.<br />
As I wrote HTML and tweaked images, I could see the bright sunshine outside. I figured our next game would be nice, and I could finally strip down to my shorts. I should know better than that&#8230;<br />
When I got back to Deerfoot Athletic Park, the sky was cloudy, the wind blowing harder, and it seemed even colder than in the morning. I was the first to arrive, and I watched as two teams battled for the chance to play again later in the day.<br />
Our team assembled, even with a couple of spares for a change, and prepared to take the field. I took right field, as usual, and started freezing to death. It wasn&#8217;t much above zero (as was fully shown when it snowed in the fourth inning).<br />
In fact, it was so cold the voices shivered. Luckily, I was still able to play reasonably well. But even if we had all played in top-notch form, we could not have held back the onslaught. We were outmatched, and it wasn&#8217;t by a small margin. Final score: 22-8.<br />
Losing by that much when you play poorly isn&#8217;t such a bad loss &#8212; you kind of expect it. Losing by that much when you put everything you have into the game is just downright demoralizing.<br />
Tonight, we&#8217;re back at the game for another doubleheader. (All our play dates this year are doubleheaders, for some stupid reason.) My shin is still a little stiff from Saturday, but with luck I&#8217;ll be able to play.<br />
Just so long as I have the voices to keep me company in right field.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The goats are being sucked.&#8221;<br />
Many of you will stare at the screen and wonder what the heck that means. Others of you will nod in recognition. For the benefit of those who have no idea what that quote means, &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221; was the Rad Sox&#8217; battle cry last year just before taking to the field.<br />
Yesterday was my new team&#8217;s first foray onto the diamond. I play with one of two company softball teams. There were 40 people who turned out this year, so we made up two separate teams. One, called the Cooters (got me on the meaning of this one), and the one I play for &#8212; the Base HREFs. Never let HTML developers try to come up with punny names. They can&#8217;t.<br />
I was a late joiner. During my interview at Critical Mass back in early March, I saw a sign-up sheet for the softball team. Thinking that this would be a good way to get me out, I made myself remember the sign was there for when I was hired. (Yes, I was optimistic.) Sure enough, I got myself onto the team within a few days of starting here.<br />
Because I was a late joiner, and because there were already 20 people on each team, I was accidentally missed from the first batch of email, one of which listed the first (and so far only) practice. That said, I made it out to last night&#8217;s games (we had a double-header), complete with a jersey (left over from last year).<br />
This year is going to be difficult. I know only a couple of people on the team. Our captain, Ken, knows the rules, but he&#8217;s not a tenth as cool (nor does he possess the attitude) as Lee, the Rad Sox&#8217; &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221;. There&#8217;s no star player jackrabbitting around the outfield. And I have no mentor this year to correct my plethora of bad habits &#8212; the gap Neall filled is quite large, as was evident by last night&#8217;s games.<br />
The first game was against ourselves, or rather, the other CMass team. This was going to make for interesting water cooler conversation and stairwell banter &#8212; to the loser would go the ignominy of defeat, to the winner the right to brag for the rest of the year. So needless to say, we all played horribly.<br />
There were shining points &#8212; both teams had their rallies while the outfield scrambled madly to catch fly balls, and the infield shut down runners with Terminator-like efficiency. There were also the downpoints &#8230; like my batting. I didn&#8217;t hit a darn thing all night. Nada. Sqwat. In fact, I *think* I *might* have actually disturbed the ball&#8217;s wake once. Struck out every time I went up. At least last year I tended to hit the ball more often than not.<br />
I need to spend an afternoon in a batting cage&#8230;<br />
I will say one thing about the fields in Calgary &#8212; like the Prairies, they&#8217;re flat. It&#8217;s great. No worries about a fast rolling ball suddenly flying up into your schnoz. I&#8217;m not really looking forward to reliving last year&#8217;s little injury.<br />
The game lasted only seven innings &#8212; we had a double-header, and the sun sets just after 9:00, leaving only about three hours of play. Both teams played hard, and for a while, I thought we were losing (rather badly) to the other team. But in the bottom of the seventh (we were up at bat), I was surprised to find out that we were only three runs down. Then it was two &#8230; one &#8230; and then tied. We ended the game with a final run.<br />
Then the dispute began. The Cooters believed that we had miscounted, believing they were six runs ahead. Name calling and insults &#8212; the usual interoffice banter &#8212; erupted around the diamond while the score keepers sorted the mess out. Despite the loud by-the-books manager of the Cooters (who I&#8217;m told is the CEO&#8217;s brother), they missed an entire inning of runs. We hailed victorious.<br />
Somehow, I&#8217;ve got the feeling that&#8217;s the only win we&#8217;ll see this season.<br />
The second game was &#8230; well, I was going to put in a neat little literary description to give you an idea of how badly we lost. The only problem is I can&#8217;t think of one good enough to convey such an utter defeat. The only thing that comes close is Napoleon&#8217;s naval defeat in Aboukir Bay by Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1798. Nelson claimed &#8220;there is no word to describe such an utter victory&#8221;. It was the most decisive battle in naval history.<br />
No, I didn&#8217;t just pluck that little fact out of my head &#8212; living on my own, I&#8217;ve had a bit of time to watch TV, and I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of The Learning Channel lately. They had a show on Napoleon&#8217;s Obsession with Egypt &#8212; quite a fascinating show. I can certainly understand why Napoleon was so revered. (Perhaps more interesting was another TLC show that told the story of Napoleon&#8217;s murder many years later on the island of St. Helena.)<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a geek with lots of useless trivia. Let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;ve never needed to use a lifeline on &#8220;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&#8221;. Not that I watch the show with any regularity at all. In fact, I think I&#8217;ve seen parts of about seven episodes. I usually turn the channel because I end up screaming at the guy who can&#8217;t remember if Humpty Dumpty fell of a wall or a horse.<br />
I played right field during both games. In the first game, I was bored. The Cooters are all right-handed batters. But The Screwballs (the second time) not only had left-handed batters, but had people who could place hits. I was running all over the place. That&#8217;s how I got injured.<br />
Relax, no blood loss. I was sprinting after a shot (that I should have caught), but as usual I was too shallow. Realizing this, I quickly pivoted to lunge and catch it. Only problem was that while my body was turning, my right leg decided to mutiny. I somehow ended up wrenching my quadricep. I barely made it through the inning, and ended up sitting out the rest of the game.<br />
Today, I&#8217;m sore. That&#8217;s to be expected, I guess. I haven&#8217;t played in about nine months. But I&#8217;m not as bad as I thought I would be. I&#8217;m going to the batting cages &#8212; I&#8217;m in dire need of practice. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll do better in this weekend&#8217;s tournament.<br />
You can all stop laughing now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Years ago, Easter weekend meant a trip to my grandmother&#8217;s in Toronto for a dinner with the rest of the family. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;d been in a large family gathering for Easter, but this year certainly did put a new spin on everything.<br />
I&#8217;ll get to that in a moment or two.<br />
Friday morning started slowly for me. Usually, I&#8217;m up around 6:00 (sometimes as late at 6:30, if I manage to completely out-sleep my alarm clock), and I start to get ready for work. Recently, it&#8217;s included a trip down to the pool for 30 minutes of swimming (although I have yet to reach 30 minutes, I&#8217;m wiped out after just over 20 &#8212; I figure it&#8217;s going to take me a while before I&#8217;m even close to being in the same shape I was in high school). Then it&#8217;s a shower, make lunch, and head out.<br />
Friday morning, I didn&#8217;t get up until 9am. I would&#8217;ve slept later, but the light in my room was overpowering. At least I didn&#8217;t wake up to an alarm clock. I skipped the morning swim.<br />
One of the things on my agenda was attempting to clean the apartment. It&#8217;s been on the agenda almost since I moved in, but you&#8217;d be surprised at the lack of motivation to do that. Dunno why.<br />
I watched TV for a while, before moving a few things around. The impact was negligible. Around 11:30, I decided to call Adile, one of my co-workers (and rapidly becoming a good friend). Adile&#8217;s an interesting character, to say the least. He&#8217;s 23 (aside from Rob, who sits next to me, I think I&#8217;m the second oldest in my department), has a masters in Palaeontology (he was working on a PhD before his funding ran out), and is a wizard with bizarre HTML layouts.<br />
He also had a wad of furniture he wants to sell. A couch (made by Sealy), a matching loveseat, coffee table, dresser, and a desk. All for $200. Needless to say, I&#8217;m mildly interested.<br />
We&#8217;d arranged the day before that he&#8217;d call me and we&#8217;d arrange a time for me to drop over. But after 11:30, I thought I&#8217;d check with him before trying to plan the rest of my day. (It&#8217;s a pain in the neck trying to figure out what to do when the person you want to get a hold of isn&#8217;t getting a hold of you.) He was still asleep. I remember being able to do that. He said he&#8217;d call me later, so I took the opportunity to do something else.<br />
I went to work.<br />
Relax, I didn&#8217;t actually do any work &#8230; at least not *work* work. I did my own thing. I&#8217;m helping a friend of mine with a website. It&#8217;s good practice for me. It also gave me a chance to read email (I actually get more email here than I did at Radical &#8230; and I dreaded coming back from vacation at Radical, reading email took hours).<br />
Around 3:00, Adile finally called me and said I could drop by. I hopped in the car and made a beeline (as much a beeline as can be made in some of Calgary&#8217;s hurly-burly subdivisions) for Adile&#8217;s home. Adile still lives with his parents (I make no comments on that, for I did the same thing until I was 25) in Ranchlands, not far from where Stuart and Therese live.<br />
The couch was an off-white, though parts of it were more off-white than others. It&#8217;s well-used, but not in bad shape. I looked at it carefully, and it didn&#8217;t look too bad. Even if it did get a little unsightly, a quick drop sheet eliminates that problem. Of course, this is still something I need to throw by my future roommate and see what he thinks.<br />
I quickly returned to my apartment to shower and make myself presentable &#8212; Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike had invited me to Easter dinner at Chez Znack. Before leaving Ranchlands, I stopped briefly at Crowfoot Village to pick up a 12 pack of Sleeman&#8217;s and a couple of bottles of wine (partly for dinner, and partly for partial payment for all my Aunt and Uncle have done for me).<br />
I arrived in Whitehorn just after 5:00. Uncle Mike was out front adjusting the lawn sprinkler (spring has sprung here in Calgary, despite a few naysayers who keep predicting a &#8220;big dump&#8221;). Maggie (their Dalmatian) looked happy to see me.<br />
The kitchen renovation was still in progress, though the trickiest part of the work was complete. When last I&#8217;d seen the kitchen, the counters were reduced to plywood, awaiting a layer of tiles. The tiles were now on the counter, though they had yet to be grouted. Tiles also adorned the walls in a backsplash following the length of the counter. It looked wonderful. The tiles are 6&#215;6, coloured almost a sandy-grey. Some of the wall tiles are decorative, and add a nice touch to the design. It will be really interesting to see what the kitchen looks like when it&#8217;s done.<br />
We were served fried scallops as appetizers. I&#8217;m finding I&#8217;ll eat most seafood now, though it all seems to taste the same. I have a sneaky suspicion that it won&#8217;t be long before I&#8217;m eat (shudder) lobster. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;<br />
Between the appetizer and dinner, my phone rang. It was Greg Mayer, one of my friends and former co-workers from Radical Entertainment. He was in Calgary for the weekend visiting relatives, and we had made rough plans to get together during the weekend. We talked briefly, setting up a tentative time for the following day.<br />
Dinner was turkey. I was looking forward to turkey. I love turkey. Especially with turkey gravy. On mashed potatoes. Mmmmm. And stuffing. Double mmmmm.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we finished dinner (with Jen rushing off to play her video game, pausing only long enough to ask me to come down and play with her when I was done). Turkey coma wasn&#8217;t far off&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Turkey coma&#8221;, for those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of it, is Stuart&#8217;s term for the sleepiness that sets in after a good turkey dinner. A lot of people dismiss it as having eaten too much. In reality, it&#8217;s the turkey. There&#8217;s a chemical in turkey meat that acts like a natural sedative &#8212; it makes you sleepy. The more you eat, the sleepier you get. (And having wine with the meal really doesn&#8217;t help matters much.)<br />
Just as I was about to go downstairs and join Jen in her video game, Aunt Brenda handed me a little gift &#8212; a set of frying pans. Just when I&#8217;d thought I was about to start paying them back for everything they did for me, they had to go and do something else nice for me. Like I said before, I love my family &#8230; even if I do feel like I&#8217;m going to be forever in their debt.<br />
When I got downstairs, Jen was in the middle of playing her rented copy of Super Smash Brothers. There are some games where I can actually beat Jen. This ain&#8217;t one of &#8217;em. As a team, we were unbeatable &#8230; though she could have won the match on her own. Against her, well, &#8220;total slaughter&#8221; comes to mind. She&#8217;d been playing all week, and I hadn&#8217;t. I got in a few good hits, but I was no match.<br />
I decided it was time to leave when I noticed that Aunt Brenda had succumbed to Turkey Coma (she had been overseeing the carnage). Frying pans in tow, I returned to the sanctity of downtown Calgary.<br />
I rose just after 9:00 on Saturday, again forced awake by the bright sun. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I rather like it this way. The sun is certainly a more preferable way to rise in the morning.<br />
My early wakening also afforded me the luxury of doing something I haven&#8217;t done since before I went to university &#8212; watch Saturday Morning cartoons. Although I watched them until noon, I didn&#8217;t get the same pleasure. Probably because most of them seem to be either Pokemon or Digimon. Nothing like the ones I watched when I was a kid: Blackstar, The Smurfs, Thundarr the Barbarian, Spiderman and His Amazing Friends, Pac Man, Alvin and the Chipmunks, He Man, Droids, Ewoks &#8230; the list is literally endless (I watched a lot of cartoons). Although Fox is bringing back Dungeons and Dragons @ 10:30 PST next Saturday.<br />
Sometime after noon, Greg called. He was ready to get together. I still had to run through the shower, and I had to pick him up. Originally, I had hoped that Torre (another of my former co-workers, Torre left Radical just days after me (though I suspect his reasons for leaving weren&#8217;t as dire as my own) and has landed in Calgary) might join us, but Greg told me Torre was entertaining friends. I&#8217;ll have to make sure I call Torre up soon.<br />
Greg told me where he was, and the basic direction I needed go. Looking at the map, it looked pretty easy.<br />
After being in Calgary for nearly two months, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d know better&#8230;<br />
I was about a half hour late because what I thought was on the map ended up being something complete different, sending me off in a bad direction because I hadn&#8217;t expected the city planners to do something so stupid &#8230; or at least the map designers to mark it properly. Luckily, Greg wasn&#8217;t upset&#8230;<br />
Returning with Greg to downtown, we stopped at the Barley Mill, a bar at Eau Claire Market. It&#8217;s got probably the best selection of draught beer in town, and is cheaper than Shank&#8217;s. Greg and I perched ourselves on the patio, and basked in the warm sunshine.<br />
It was good to see Greg again. I hadn&#8217;t seen him since he helped bring me to Calgary. I know this will sound weird, but seeing Greg was kind of like pinching myself, helping me to remember that the last two years weren&#8217;t a dream. Call it a reality check if you want. But it was good to see him.<br />
We talked for a couple of hours about virtually everything that we could think of. Greg had to be careful, though. I&#8217;m not a Radical employee, and he had to skirt the cool stuff that&#8217;s always floating around there. I could tell he was having a bit of trouble too &#8212; he almost looked like a kid who&#8217;s just dying to tell some other kid a secret. I found one of them out this morning on the &#8216;Net &#8212; Radical&#8217;s not making sports games anymore. At least not for Fox, who announced they were bailing out of the genre. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Radical does next&#8230;<br />
My phone rang around 3:30. It was Aunt Brenda. Easter Dinner Part 2 was with the rest of the Western Clan (save for Nana) that evening, and I was informed that I would be picked up at 5:00 instead of 6:00. This meant Greg and I had to cut our visit a bit short. Luckily though, the time didn&#8217;t seem too short.<br />
As we left the Barley Mill, Greg asked if it was possible to go by the Alberta Boot Factory Outlet. I had mentioned earlier in one of our conversations that I not only work but live fairly close to it (relax, I&#8217;m not buying cowboy boots), and Greg was looking to see what he could find.<br />
The Alberta Boot Factory Outlet is on 10th Ave. SW, at the corner of 5th St. (just a block or so away from Cowboys &#8212; a local western bar). It&#8217;s large &#8212; so is the selection. But Greg&#8217;s criteria were tight &#8230; very tight. There was one pair in the entire shop that he liked. Really liked. I mean *really* liked.<br />
But he didn&#8217;t buy &#8217;em. Though if he had the money, he would have. Why didn&#8217;t he? One of his criteria was for steel toes, and I have yet to hear of a cowboy boot with steel toes. (I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to go line dancing with someone who wore steel-toed cowboy boots &#8230; not that I&#8217;d want to line dancing in the first place.)<br />
Greg agonized about the boot problem all the way back to his Aunt&#8217;s. I know what that kind of torture feels like. I&#8217;m on a restricted budget myself. I get paid this week (I think &#8212; the schedule here is a little strange), at which point I can start getting my life in gear.<br />
I met my Aunt and Uncle out in front of my apartment building at 5:15 (I&#8217;d called earlier and asked for a short delay). Then it was off to a part of the family I&#8217;d never met before. This was my Aunt Alaine&#8217;s sister and brother in-law. They own a home in the western edge of Kensington. A nice home. A really nice home.<br />
My parents had met Dawn and Ron before, when they went on a cruise about a year ago. This was good for me &#8212; it meant I wasn&#8217;t a complete stranger to them. We got there before the rest of the family, so we took the opportunity to look around a bit.<br />
The house is amazing. It&#8217;s on a small lot, so it&#8217;s a very vertical house. If only the home builders in Vancouver knew how nice a place you could build on such a small lot&#8230; The main floor had the dining space, living space, kitchen, and a parlour. Only the parlour had doors, the rest of it was open space.<br />
The kitchen was finished with cherry cabinets (wood, not colour). Ron mentioned that he&#8217;d never use cherry again &#8212; too high maintenance. Uncle Mike and I marvelled at the construction &#8212; it was gorgeous. As was the rest of the house. The upstairs had possibly the most efficient use of space I&#8217;d ever seen. Three bedrooms, all quite large. Certainly a liveable space.<br />
The Tisdales arrived not long after us. It&#8217;d been almost a year since I last saw Uncle David and Aunt Alaine, about a month since I&#8217;d seen Pam (and Muck, her boyfriend &#8230; don&#8217;t ask about the name, it&#8217;s not his real one, and I honestly don&#8217;t know the story behind it), and a couple of months since I&#8217;d seen Darren. (I last ran into him out front of the Capitol 6 when Pure3D had gone to see Toy Story 2.)<br />
Darren was a bit of a surprise. We were under the impression that he was in Indonesia doing some field work. We didn&#8217;t actually know he wasn&#8217;t there, and was in Calgary, until the night before when Uncle Mike was making golf arrangements with Uncle David. Apparently, Darren&#8217;s company didn&#8217;t get the permits they needed for the team &#8230; Darren hopes he&#8217;ll be going sometime in early May.<br />
Our final arrival was Dawn and Ron&#8217;s daughter. Now I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here and say her name was &#8220;Randy&#8221;. It might be &#8220;Randyne&#8221;, or &#8220;Rian&#8221; or &#8220;Ryean&#8221; &#8230; all I know is that I heard &#8220;Randy&#8221; when someone said her name. For all I know, it&#8217;s not her real name. For some stupid reason, I never asked. (I&#8217;m certain someone will correct me on this.)<br />
We stood about, chatting and snacking, until about 7:15, at which time we piled into three cars, and drove to our restaurant for the evening. This was Pam&#8217;s idea, and I&#8217;m going to give her full credit for sticking her neck out on this, and finding one gem of a good restaurant.<br />
It&#8217;s called &#8220;Kremlin&#8221;, and like the name suggests, it serves Soviet cuisine. I&#8217;d say &#8220;Russian&#8221;, but that wouldn&#8217;t be correct. Several of the items on the menu are Ukrainian (such as the pirogies), of which Uncle David took extreme pleasure in ribbing Uncle Mike (whose heritage is Ukrainian). My family&#8217;s a little weird some times. (Have I mentioned the midnight excursion through a golf course on mountain bikes looking for elk?)<br />
We all opted to get platters of food, so we could all share in the various tastes of the menu. The server/owner told us that because they had only four burners, they&#8217;d have to bring food out in shifts.<br />
Oh yeah, I never told you how big this place was. Ever seen pictures of those small, quaint little Dari-Freeze joints? 50&#8217;s-style? That was what housed Kremlin. Tiny doesn&#8217;t even really come close to describing the size of this place. There were six tables. We had two of them. We dominated the place, literally. We outnumbered all the other patrons combined, and we certainly were louder than them.<br />
The first round was pirogies. There were two flavours: Spinach and feta cheese, and pork and ginger. I much preferred the spinach and cheese &#8212; I found the pork a little bit on the mushy side. But they were very tasty, as was the coleslaw (or Ukrainian salad, I&#8217;m not exactly sure what it was) and the roasted nuts. I stayed away from the beets. Ick.<br />
Round two was tequila prawns. (Doesn&#8217;t sound Soviet to me, but hey &#8212; it&#8217;s worth trying.) Yes, I eat prawns. Go figure. They were accompanied with some rice which added some excellent flavour.<br />
We had to wait a while for round three, during which time we delved into a couple more bottles of wine (I cut myself off at about two glasses, opting for a bottle of Alexander Keith&#8217;s instead).<br />
Round three was curried chicken and rice (supposedly basmati, but it sure tasted like couscous), appearing about a half hour or so later. This, again, was an excellent part of the meal, and was fairly filling. It was a good choice.<br />
Now, most people would end dinner there. But we were having too much fun, and dove into dessert. First off were fruit and chocolate crepes, followed shortly by banana and chocolate egg rolls (topped with ice cream). The last round was fruit pirogies. Oh yes, please understand that we didn&#8217;t get full orders each &#8212; these were platters as well.<br />
Then came the bill. A quick batch of math, and I dove into my wallet to dig out enough to pay for dinner. Imagine my horror when I realized I was $20 short. I was about to ask to be let out and raid a bank machine when Uncle David told me to put my wallet away (he did the same for Darren, Pam, and Muck). I said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again &#8212; I love my family.<br />
Three and a half hours after entering, we all staggered out and found our ways home. I practically collapsed onto the mat on the floor until I could move again. Ouch.<br />
Sunday in downtown Calgary is quiet &#8212; nothing opens before noon. Which is fine with me &#8212; gives me time to sleep in and do other things. Like sleep.<br />
I went out walking around downtown, popping in and out of whatever stores happened to actually be open (a large number of them declared they were closed for Easter) before I ended up back at Critical Mass, again to do some work for a friend.<br />
I spent the rest of the day cleaning up. I made more headway on Sunday than I had in the past week. Probably because I had nothing better to do. I was waiting for Stuart and Therese to get back from Edmonton so we could get together. I was in no rush.<br />
At a little after 5:00, Stuart called. They hadn&#8217;t left Edmonton yet, and wouldn&#8217;t likely be leaving for a while. I suspected they were having worlds more fun than I was. Instead of dinner with friends, I went over to the Subway (barely a block away) and got something to get me through until morning.<br />
It was a good weekend, but I should think I would call it Thanksgiving Weekend, rather than Easter. I had a lot to be thankful for: My family, my friends, my freedom.<br />
Hmm&#8230; sounds like a good motto.</p>
