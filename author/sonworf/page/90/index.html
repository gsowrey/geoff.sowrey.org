		<p>I woke earlier than usual &#8212; about 8:45 or so. Craig was still up, but not nearly as tired as when he&#8217;d scared the bejezesus out of me.<br />
Turning down his offer of a beer (for Craig, this was still the end of the day), I got a glass of orange juice. Craig and I took the opportunity to have a chat about his career. I guess I forced the issue. I&#8217;m worried about him. I don&#8217;t know Craig as well as perhaps I could &#8212; he&#8217;d family, but aside from a few visits, I don&#8217;t know him even remotely as well as I should for a brother-in-law. For what I do know, though, Craig works too hard. I know the desire, though. I know what drives him, what pushes him forward. I had that drive once. It&#8217;s died off in recent months, mostly due to recognition of my own faults.<br />

		<p>Pretty much keep with the trend, I woke late again. When I walked out of the bedroom, though, I found the door to Craig and Cathy&#8217;s bedroom open. Given the time of the morning, I assumed Craig would be asleep. I peered in to see if perhaps he had simply not closed the door.<br />
&#8220;Good morning, Geoff&#8230;&#8221; a voice from behind said. I damn near had a heart attack.<br />

		<p>I woke late again. I could get used to this.<br />
Mom came to pick me up after getting myself all cleaned up. We went down to her place, where I took the time to try and bring her computer up to snuff again. It seems that every time I&#8217;m out, I need to do something to her computer. Sometimes it&#8217;s something simple. Other times, I spend a couple of days trying to get it to cooperate with me. Such was the case this day.<br />

The plan was simple: on their way to work, Therese and Stuart would drop me off at Central Station where, like when I arrived in Montreal, I would proceed to kill a couple of hours before my train boarded (around 11:00).<br />

We had originally planned to do the breakfast thing, perhaps find a nice dim sum in Chinatown, or make use of one of the French cafes. But after a bit of discussion, we realized that it wasn&#8217;t breakfast that we were particularly interested in, it was lunch. And not any ordinary lunch, we needed one of Montreal&#8217;s legendary delis.<br />

		<p>I slept nearly 12 hours. I woke up sporadically, hearing the odd noise of running water and cats playing. Simply put, though, I was too damn tired to care. I hadn&#8217;t slept that well in ages.<br />
I woke up in time for lunch, which was convenient, since both Therese and Stuart were ready for additional sustinence themselves. It was the first weekend since Thanksgiving that they didn&#8217;t have specific plans, since they didn&#8217;t have to worry about something having to happen or having to do. No plans, no predefined ideas, no nothing. And it was driving them nuts to not have specific things to do.<br />

Today is the start of my first break longer than a long weekend in almost a year. I&#8217;ve been working away on my job, barely taking time off, slaving through one of the hardest Christmases I can remember, and wondering whether anyone&#8217;s really noticed.<br />
I won&#8217;t even mention my lengthy list of non-work activities.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been another six months, and that can only mean one thing &#8212; another visit to the dentist.<br />
Normally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind so much. It&#8217;s just another trip to the dentist, right? It should be nothing more complicated than a simple check-up, right?<br />
If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned in the last couple of years, there&#8217;s nothing more serious than that.<br />
I went on Tuesday to the dentist for my regular six month checkup. I had fully expected that this would be something simple. I had digured that this would be as routine as most of my dental checkups have been over the last 31-odd years. I had hoped that this would be nice and easy.<br />
You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d learn, eh?<br />
Part-way through my scaling process with the hygenist, Dr. Chen walked in and decided to conduct his inspection. What to my horror should he find than not one, not two, but *three* new cavities. *THREE*! What the hell?! How on earth can I get three cavities? That just doesn&#8217;t compute.<br />
Let&#8217;s get realistic. My dental hygiene hasn&#8217;t really changed in the last 30 years. It&#8217;s pretty much the same from when I was a kid. For 29 years I went without a cavity. In the last three years alone, I&#8217;ve had *five* cavities. That&#8217;s an average that I&#8217;m not particularly happy with.<br />
At the time, we discussed my imminent return, along with changes that have happened to my insurance policy. These are proving to be much larger issues than I ever could have dreaded for.<br />
Let&#8217;s be honest. No-one really wants to deal with a bad insurance situation. Why? Simply put, because ultimately, the payments come down to your pocketbook, which is why you have insurance in the first place.<br />
Once upon a time, I had a good insurance plan. That was what the dentist was planning on. He figured, along with the hygenist, that I would get at least eight units of scaling a year. That was the sort of thing that they considered normal. As I&#8217;m finding out of late, normal is far from it.<br />
In the last round of negotiation, our dental plan went from once every six months to once every nine months. Our units of scaling (a unit is 15 minutes long) went from whatever the number was to a mere one. One solitary, single unit of scaling every nine months. I don&#8217;t know a single adult who uses less than two per visit.<br />
So now I need to plan how to handle going every five months, which means part of it comes out of a health spending account I have, and the rest out of insurance. Especially if I&#8217;m getting that many cavities.<br />
Which brings my back to my original point. So I&#8217;m sittting in the dentist&#8217;s chair, having Dr. Chin bury yet another implement of medieval torture to try and dig out the decay that apparently has entered into my mouth, despite all my efforts to prevent such a thing.<br />
And did I mention no freezing this time around?<br />
Okay, these are tiny little cavities. Next to not even worrying about. Except that they&#8217;re cavities, of course. That means having to pay *some* attention to them. Which means having to have them drilled out and filled before they turn ugly.<br />
Vibrations are the only thing that do me in. I hate that. They make my jaw squirm, and my gag reflex really kick in. But nearly as much as having the ultraviolet light that&#8217;s supposed to set the gel that&#8217;s injected into the newly-drilled holes into some solid material. I gagged so badly that one tooth almost had to be competely reset.<br />
It&#8217;s annoying. Dr. Chin has no real idea why this is happening. He says it could be a chain of events. I wonder if perhaps it&#8217;s an issue of lack of flouridation of Calgary water and that my favourite toothpaste of years past (Aim) is no longer being made.<br />
But this is just a guess.<br />
Either way, I&#8217;ve got more holes drilled in my head (peanut gallery can keep comments to themselves) and have to deal with the future. I just hope it means less drilling. I don&#8217;t think I can deal with that kind of pressure.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I looked forward to Valentine&#8217;s Day, if I ever looked forward to it at all. I can&#8217;t imagine there was ever a time, but I have to admit that even my somewhat freakishly long memory develops gaps and loses snippets every now and then.<br />
For as along as I can remember, I never liked Valentine&#8217;s Day. In grade school, I was forced by concentration camp-like authority, to give Valentine cards to everyone in the class. Even the guys. I never liked this idea. I had a couple of friends, to be sure, but these were *girls*, and I never hung out with them.<br />
Over the years, my loathing of the particular day changed. Now there weren&#8217;t any rules &#8230; but there were no women in my life outside of family and a couple of friends. While most of the other guys enjoyed a day of close togetherness with a significant other, I wallowed in my own self-misery.<br />
So imagine this year, when after a couple of months of &#8220;power dating&#8221;, I realize that for the first time in memory, I not only acknowledged that Valentine&#8217;s Day was coming up, but I was actually looking forward to it!<br />
By now, you&#8217;ve probably figured out that there was someone whom I was interested in taking out that night &#8212; an object of my affections. In that, you are correct. But the trick here is to realize that despite being in a position of dating four women (Kristen, Alex, Simone, and Tanis), there was only one woman I was even remotely interested in taking out.<br />
Luckily for me, Kristen ended up with a free evening.Thus I started the plan to experience the first good Valentine&#8217;s day in possibly my entire life.<br />
It&#8217;s only taken 31 years&#8230;<br />
I woke up a little later than planned for a Saturday, but not too late. All that was going to happen was missing going to the gym &#8212; annoying, yes, but not the end of the world. First order of business: create the &#8220;to do&#8221; list. On it were: car wash, hair cut, wine, strawberries, presents, rose, and mailing out a pair of cheques that had to be cashed.<br />
Many of these little tasks were taken care of at the same time. I went down to the Eaton Centre downtown to get my hair cut at a barber shop I knew of (repeated attempts to get my hair cut at the office had all failed due to one reason or another). Luckily, the parking garage offered a car detailing service, which &#8212; lucky me! &#8212; was open and operational.<br />
The haircut was, a little surprisingly, quite an experience. The cool weather (and a freakishly weird fog the night before) had kept the pedestrian traffic downtown quite light, leaving the barber and I to have quite a lengthy conversation. It was a good one for me, as the barber had a few good ideas for things Kristen and I could do that night. Leave it to a woman to give you the inside scoop when you didn&#8217;t even realize you needed it.<br />
Presents, wine, fresh haircut, and uber-clean car in hand, I returned home to finish the remainder of my errands, including getting some strawberries from Safeway, and double-dipping them in chocolate.<br />
Note to self: I need to find a way to soften the chocolate. It was a little difficult to eat like that.<br />
By about 15:00, I was mostly done. Except for a load of laundry I needed, as I realized with a bit of a shock that I had no clean underwear. Heaven forbid you should go out on Valentine&#8217;s Day with anything less than fresh-smelling undies.<br />
I arrived at Kristen&#8217;s just after 17:00, where we hung out for a few moments, exchanging presents. I had expected a one-way exchange, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a heart-shaped box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates &#8212; one of my close favourites.<br />
And so we were off to Catch Restaurant. I&#8217;ve been there almost a little too often in the last few months. But admitedly, I don&#8217;t mind too much. It&#8217;s a bit pricey, yes, but in the end, it&#8217;s all about the experience, and the amazing food. Luckily, Kristen had never been in the dining room before, or experienced the sheer joy of exquisite cuisine.<br />
Dinner was a pseudo-set menu. You had a choice of one of four appetizers, a bowl of soup, a choice of one of three entrees, followed by a custom dessert &#8212; themed white for women, and dark for men. The idea, of course, to share the experience.<br />
The experience even went to far as to include an unusual wine that I&#8217;d never had before: a Vignonier. This peculiar vintage is from France, and has one of the most subtle flavours for a wine that I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Imagine the fullness of a cabernet sauvignon, but dial down the volume by about 60%. It&#8217;s not watered down, just not as bold. I was a little skeptical, and at first wasn&#8217;t even sure that the choice was correct. But after a few sips, I really began to understand the appeal of it.<br />
Following our (fairly expensive, but well-appreciated) meal, we escaped to explore the other activities of the night. This led us down the street to Murrietta&#8217;s, one of Calgary&#8217;s primiere night spots.<br />
If you want to go someplace after your meals, kick back with a good drink and maybe experience some outstanding music, this is the place you go. The live bands that frequent Murrietta&#8217;s make the sometimes-pricey drinks much more affordable.<br />
We took seats along the west wall, a few tables away from the stage. It was an ideal location to engage in conversations, martinis, and some crowd-watching.<br />
The conversation was our usual light repertoire of miscellany, peppered with humourous anecdotes and observations, not really amounting to anything specific.<br />
The martinis, though a little more expensive than at other places, were quite tasty. Kristen had two chocolate martinis, while I started off with a caramel apple, followed by a chocolate. Both were very delish.<br />
Crowd watching became our primary habit. There were some interesting people all evening. While neither Kristen or myself were in our finest, we were far more than just passable. Many of the patrons at Catch looked little more than fresh off the oil derrick with a spin through the laundry cycle. Murrietta&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t any better.<br />
One particular happy couple caught our attention, specifically the male. He had a most unusual haircut that Kristen and I could only pass off as the result of a dare or a lost bet. The back of his head resembled &#8230; well, a pineapple. He looked right out of Archie and Jughead comics. It was peculiar to say the least.<br />
The couple more than made up for the haircut in their ability to dance. It was swing-style, though not too exaggerated. The band, playing a jazzy kind of blues, seemed more than happy to endulge the couple by extending their tunes to quite a degree so that they would have more time to show their skills. Kristen and I, self-professed anti-dancers, both commented that we&#8217;d like to learn how to dance like that.<br />
Yes. Me.<br />
We left Murrietta&#8217;s after a while and headed back to Kristen&#8217;s. There, I pulled out the strawberries and a bottle of nicely-chilled icewine. We sipped and nibbled, reading questions from Mindtrap to each other, often stumbling on some of the questions (they aren&#8217;t always easy).<br />
The game went until it became &#8220;Strip Mindtrap&#8221;.<br />
And at that, dear reader, I must let you go. There are just some things that I will not write about.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Psst! Hey, wanna hear something shocking? I&#8217;m taking yoga.<br />
Relax, I haven&#8217;t grown my hair out and gone hippy (well, the hair *has* grown out, but only because I haven&#8217;t had it cut in a month and a half), nor have I become a Stepford Wife. It&#8217;s the result of having talked to so many people about how good yoga is. I know, this kind of sounds like a &#8220;If Timmy jumped off a cliff&#8230;&#8221; thing. But admittedly, anything that&#8217;s been around for about 5,000 years and been practiced by countless millions of people can&#8217;t be all bad.<br />
Right?<br />
So when the rumour of a new yoga class starting up at work started running around, I make sure James kept me in the loop. Sure enough, when word officially came out, I forked over $80 and signed my life away (basically, a &#8220;I won&#8217;t sue you for anything stupid I do&#8221; form), bought a yoga mat (about six feet long, two and a half feet wide, and about 1/4 inch thick), and tried to prepare myself for something I&#8217;d never done before.<br />
The first class was a week ago yesterday. We had a class of about nine people (the full class will be about 10, but we have yet to have a full compliment), with participants from either Project Management or Technology, with one person from Creative. We all sit in the Theatre (chairs removed), while our instructor, Lori, leads us through the various motions.<br />
The first thing you need to know is that there isn&#8217;t just one yoga. In fact, there are 40 different kinds, such as Agni, Bhakti, Japa, Mantra, Tantra, and Hatha. The one we&#8217;re doing is called Ashtanga, which is &#8220;the unitive discipline of the eight limbs&#8221; &#8230; whatever that means. The easiest way to think of it is as the aerobic version of &#8220;regular&#8221; yoga (that&#8217;s &#8220;Hatha&#8221; yoga, in case you&#8217;re interested).<br />
The second thing is that yoga isn&#8217;t just standing (or sitting) in various poses. (Some yogas can be, but ashtanga definitely ain&#8217;t.) Each pose is for stretching, flexing, meditation, or a combination of all three. Especially with ashtanga, you&#8217;ll work up a good sweat, too. By the time you get to the end, you&#8217;ll either be dying for more, or thankful that it&#8217;s over for the day.<br />
And the third is a bit of an odd one: Breathing. Yeah, kind of an important one, I know. But it&#8217;s key to being able to ensure you&#8217;re getting not only enough oxygen to handle the workout, and block out the &#8220;discomfort&#8221; (as Lori puts it). The breathing manner is specific: Always through the nose, and using the ribs to breathe, not the belly (your abdominals should be contracted as much as possible). Inhaling, you try to make the sound &#8220;suh&#8221; (with your mouth closed, of course), while making the sound &#8220;ha&#8221; while exhaling.<br />
Sounds strange, I know. The reason is clear once you get into it, though. It&#8217;s not easy to do. In fact, when you&#8217;re in a particularly awkward pose &#8212; say, Paripurna Navasana (Full Boat Pose) &#8212; you can concentrate on getting your breathing correct and not so much on the fact that your legs feel like they&#8217;re about to rip your stomach muscles apart.<br />
Generally, each yoga session starts off with a series of three poses done in succession: Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), which moves into Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward-Facing Dog), then into Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog), which is held for up to two minutes at a time. This is to help get the body ready for the lesson it&#8217;s about to receive. It&#8217;s a bit of stretching, a bit of strength, and done just fast enough to get the blood flowing.<br />
After that, it&#8217;s up to the instructor to define their pattern of torture for the day.<br />
Day #1<br />
The rest of the class has done this before. Some of them are long-term veterans. I don&#8217;t have a clue what I&#8217;m doing. Lori&#8217;s kind enough to explain the breathing thing to me, since it makes no sense to me at first. She then suggests that I just try to concentrate on the breathing and not worry too much about getting the poses right.<br />
I spend a lot of time looking at her or others in the class, because I don&#8217;t understand a thing. Many of Lori&#8217;s words are in Sanskrit (the ancient Indian language used 5,000 years ago when yoga was first defined), and it&#8217;s traditional to use the Sanskrit words. I have no idea what &#8220;bondas&#8221; are, or what she&#8217;s saying when we&#8217;re supposed to &#8220;Svanasana&#8221;.<br />
At the end of the class, we assume a pose which is, well, laying down with eyes closed. It&#8217;s supposed to be for relaxation, but a few of us (not me) fall asleep. I find yoga, as experienced, a lot easier than I thought. So I gather, Lori took it light on us.<br />
Day #2<br />
This time, I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;ve got an idea of what yoga is, I sort of know the motions (well, some of them), and I&#8217;m prepared for the run. We do the opening, and then start trying a few new poses we didn&#8217;t do the week before. Some are easy, some are not. Lori also kicks it up a notch, and the class is bit harder than the first one. In general, I&#8217;m able to keep up.<br />
The breathing is difficult, and I often find myself remembering how I&#8217;m supposed to breathe. It helps me concentrate on something other than the severe wobbling on my legs in some of the poses. (The wobbling, incidentally, is partly due to the position that I&#8217;m in, and partly due to trying to keep my balance without falling over.)<br />
About halfway through the class, I realized I could get into full lotus pose. (Sitting down, it&#8217;s where your feet cross, heels near or touching the hips.) I haven&#8217;t done it in about two decades, but not for lack of trying &#8212; I just never thought to. I was quite amazed with myself, actually.<br />
I realize that the final pose is actually a pose, and not just us lying down. It&#8217;s called Savasana (Corpse Pose) and is designed as a relaxtion and meditative state. The idea is to calm the body and the mind after doing countless things to it. I think I&#8217;m going to start practicing this every night when I go to bed &#8212; I always want to fall asleep.<br />
Day #3<br />
I&#8217;m keen, but a little hesitant. Why? Well, the day before, I did a fairly strenuous leg workout at the gym. Lately, this hasn&#8217;t been too much of a problem, as the protein powder I now take seems to keep the recovery period extremely short. However, having missed most of last week to schedule and exhaustion, my legs took a little longer to heal up.<br />
Based on the previous class, I figured I&#8217;d have a good chance to stretch out my quadriceps (the troublesome muscles in question). What I didn&#8217;t figure on was Lori deciding to crank up the difficulty and really put us through our paces. And, I hope by complete coincidence, really focus on our legs.<br />
One particular pose she put us into, the name of which I don&#8217;t know, pretty much put me over the edge. Basically, you&#8217;re bend forward at the waist, feet hip-width apart and bent at the knees. Keeping the feet flat on the floor, you feed one arm between the legs, and the other wraps around your back, linking somewhere around your rear end. Normally, this isn&#8217;t a problem for me to do. However, the pain in my already-sore thighs was &#8230; exquisite.<br />
Ever felt like your quadriceps were going to physically separate from your femur?<br />
I had to drop out of the pose twice, especially after my left thigh started cramping. Not a good sign.<br />
We also did a pose that I found quite enjoyable. It goes like this: Sitting, bring your feet in as tight as you can to your groin. Then have the instructor stand on your knees while forcing your head down so that your forehead touches your toes.<br />
Now here&#8217;s the kicker: I liked it. (But then, I have a very flexible groin.)<br />
Another new position we was Bakasana (Crane Pose). It&#8217;s a bit of an odd one. You start with hands placed on the mat, shoulder-width apart, fingers spread widely. Then lean forward onto your arms, and place your knees just above the elbows, and roll forward until your feet come off the ground. Ideally, you&#8217;ll be standing on your hands, with (surprisingly) little stress on your wrist.<br />
It&#8217;s a hard position, partly due to upper body strength, but also due to balance. I was actually quite amazed that I could even get into it. Unfortunately, while my strength seemed to be agreeing, my balance wasn&#8217;t as cooperative. I muttered in my thoughts:<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; oh, crap &#8230;&#8221;<br />
Thump.<br />
Right on my head, too. I had laughed at my friend because she, while doing the same pose at her class, had landed on her face. She quite rightly returned the favour when I told her about my limited success.<br />
Then we moved onto headstands. I hadn&#8217;t done one since I was in high school. I need a little practice. Surprisingly enough, getting up wasn&#8217;t really that hard. It was staying there. I thought I&#8217;d had it balanced well. But when I felt my feet having gone past the point of no return, all I could was do a tuck and roll out of what would have been a complete collapse.<br />
By the end of the class, my legs were hamburger formed into two bulky bags that somehow supported my torso and allowed me to walk. Walking down the stairs was difficult. (Heck, walking on a horizontal surface was a bit of a challenge.) I fully expected to pay for it the following morning.<br />
But despite how badly I hurt, I woke up relatively pain-free this morning. Somehow, all the stretching cancelled out the muscle shredding, and I was able to move without a wheelchair. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next class on Tuesday, without a clue of what Lori is going to do to us next. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting set of classes, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to get a lot out of yoga.<br />
The only drawback? I feel like going into Savasana during meetings&#8230;</p>
