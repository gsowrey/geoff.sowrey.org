		<p>The alarm went off at 6:45am. I was up almost immediately, Allison begged for &#8220;five more minutes&#8221;. I took the opportunity to quickly have some orange juice. Allison was in the shower moments later.<br />
We had to be at Yonge and Sheppard by 10:00am, and the trip would take about an hour. Allison wanted to get there in plenty of time, which meant we were catching the 8:03 GO Train from Clarkson.<br />
My dad delivered us to Clarkson station at 8:00. I jogged ahead of Allison and purchased tickets. After riding the GO Train for a year, I had a kind of sixth-sense that told me we had to hurry &#8212; and the time wasn&#8217;t my only tip-off. No sooner than we had our tickets in hand and were walking up the stairs to the platform did the train arrive. Like clockwork.<br />
The train went express at Clarkson, which meant we were downtown in about 20 minutes &#8212; a feat that is virtually impossible in a car at that time of day. (Of course, now that I&#8217;ve said that, one of you will probably try to prove me wrong.) Arriving at Union Station, we followed the other lemmings into the GO Concourse and into the subway.<br />
The furthest north on the Yonge line I had been was York Mills, where I got off during my tenure at Digital Equipment. That was nearly six years ago. (Six years? Oh boy, I can feel them gray hairs just popping out of my head &#8230; and the other hairs falling off.) We were heading to Sheppard, two more stops beyond that. Allison had no idea just how far north we were going.<br />
We were starving by the time we arrived. Luckily, there was a friendly neighbourhood McDonald&#8217;s on the McCorner. We indulged ourselves with a bit of McBreakfast (which is known to bring on period bouts of McNausea). The McPlace was not even half-full of people, but still took a while to get our McMeal. At first, I thought my McServer&#8217;s name was &#8220;Ebola&#8221; &#8212; imagine getting stuck with that name! As it turned out, her name was &#8220;Errola&#8221;. Dunno if that&#8217;s any better&#8230;<br />
About 9:30, we headed to the building where Allison was to have her meeting. During her departure, I was going to make a few phone calls to obtain information and make a general nuisance of myself.<br />
Allison was up there for two hours. It took me only 45 minutes to complete my tasks. (I also ran out of quarters for the payphone.) During that time, I got a tonne of information about setting up a webserver over an ASDL line, made arrangements for lunch and dinner, made an appointment for Allison at Arkipelago (my old Toronto haunt), and dropped a line to a few friends &#8230; none of whom were at their desks.<br />
That left me with a hour and 15 minutes to be bored out of my mind. I watched elevator load after elevator load walk by, none of them being Allison. After a while, I felt like a dog that watches all the cars go down the road, hoping one of them is its master. (No allusion drawing, please.)<br />
Following her seemingly-successful meeting, we headed downtown to meet with my cousin, Lauren. We went to one of her favourite restaurants, a tiny Thai bistro about a block south from Bloor. We had to wait a few minutes, but the wait was worth it &#8212; the food was good, and not too expensive (for a business-style Toronto eatery, that is).<br />
After lunch, we hopped the subway back down to Queen Street to walk to Arkipelago. It was strange walking down streets I hadn&#8217;t been on in two years. Things were at the same time familiar, but not. It was like someone had taken a picture of my old world, changed a few things, and then shown me the picture without telling me what they had changed.<br />
The familiar smell of Arkipelago was weaker than I remembered &#8230; but it had been two years since I last smelled the aroma of the wood and varnish that permeated the air. The space seemed a bit more cramped, especially with the additional people. When I had left Arkipelago, there were about 15 people. Over 30 people occupy its spaces. The people scattered everyone reminded me of what Arkipelago looked like when I started there.<br />
The meeting was with Diedre, one of Arkipelago&#8217;s newer acquisitions. We had hoped to meet with Tim or Todd, but they were both in Europe. Be that as it may, the meeting went very well, or at least so we thought. Following the discussion (which I was mostly a silent witness), I quickly visited with the Arkipelago veterans who were still there.<br />
We walked down to St. Lawrence Market, so I could show Allison Toronto&#8217;s idea of the Granville Island Market. Then it was off to meet Brenda and Marek at the Movenpick in BCE Place. We enjoyed an interesting dinner and a good discussion. Then we had to split ways and go home.</p>

		<p>If Sunday was quiet, Monday was dead. Being Thanksgiving Monday, it also meant that every store in Ontario was closed. (Stupid Holiday Shopping Act.) As it stood, Allison had work to do. Unlike myself, who was trying his best to distance himself from work, Allison had brought work with her. In an attempt to extend her client base, we were going to visit two companies in search of more work.<br />
One of them wanted a proposal that Allison would present during their meeting. Allison also wanted (well, not really, but she had no choice) to work on a series of factsheets for another company. I set her up on my mother&#8217;s computer downstairs, and let her run free.<br />
I spent part of the day calling friends, seeing who was available and who wasn&#8217;t. Some people I couldn&#8217;t get a hold of &#8212; bad phone numbers, no answer, no answering machine (it&#8217;s nearly the third millennium, people &#8212; get with it!).<br />
We met up with Kathryn that evening. It was so good to see her again &#8212; her insanely busy schedule often keeps her correspondence to a minimum &#8230; as did the long distance phone call she had to make to get her email. (I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I sent a snail-mail letter.)<br />
The three of us drove around Oakville in search of a place to have a light bite and a long conversation. After a bit of frustration, we ended up in Jack Astor&#8217;s, ordering bruchetta. The long conversation ensued.<br />
It was good to talk with Kathryn again. She&#8217;s one of my closest friends, even though I&#8217;m lucky if I get to see her once a year. It was pure luck that were in the same vicinity at the same time, so I was more than happy to take advantage of it.<br />
About two or so hours later, we called it an evening, and headed home. We wanted to get to bed a little earlier than usual &#8212; we had a train to catch the following morning.</p>

		<p>The fire was still going the next morning. I don&#8217;t know if they rekindled it, or if the fire had just simply burned all night.<br />
Breakfast was eggs, bacon, leftover ham, and potatoes (not the deep-fried ones, thank Heaven). It was just as tasty as ever. Following our repast, Allison and I hit the road to go home.<br />
We retraced most of our route, including a stop at Weber&#8217;s for a quick hamburger. As we entered Barrie, we spied a familiar-looking RV travelling south. Pulling in behind, we followed my parents until my dad signalled to get off the highway at Highway 89.<br />
Here, we were given directions on how to get to my Aunt&#8217;s. We planned to (briefly) stop by Aunt Ruth&#8217;s place in Caledon East. I hadn&#8217;t been there since April 1996, and was very curious to see how the landscaping renovations had gone. I was also wanted to see my relatives.<br />
My parents weren&#8217;t coming &#8212; they had to return to Oakville. Instead, Allison and I took off across remote Ontario in search of the Lockton Spinney (the name of Aunt Ruth&#8217;s home). They weren&#8217;t there. The home was deserted, only a small fluffy cat (Iggy, so I&#8217;m told) was there to greet us.<br />
I was surprised that I could find my way out of the area with little difficulty. My dad had attempted to give me fairly complicated instructions that involved a lot of turns. I opted for three: turning onto Gore Road, turning onto Old Church Road, and turning onto Airport Road. That got us to the 407, and eventually home.<br />
The rest of Sunday was fairly relaxful. We ate dinner with my parents, and later went out to take in a movie (Mystery, Alaska). After the movie, I took Allison on a short tour of Oakville neighbourhoods. Although I often compare Oakville to Nanaimo, I know there are a lot of significant differences. Most notably, the &#8220;scummy&#8221; part.<br />
In Nanaimo, the not-so-nice parts of town are not-so-nice. In Oakville, it&#8217;s Kerr Street. For those of you who don&#8217;t know Oakville, let me provide a simple example as to what Kerr Street is like. Let&#8217;s say your normal scummy part of town is like a beat-up 1974 Ford Pinto. Let&#8217;s say your typical part of Oakville is like a Rolls-Royce. Kerr Street is like a somewhat muddy Chrysler Neon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to the smell of bacon. It must be an instinctual thing &#8212; no human can sleep through the smell of bacon. Your body takes in the smell and promptly yells: &#8220;Get up ya lazy oaf! There&#8217;s bacon to be had! GET UP!&#8221;<br />
Breakfast was huge. Omelettes, bacon, and potatoes. There was also champagne and orange juice (mixed in the stronger-than-usual 1:1 ratio) to wash it all down. When all was said and eaten, we were stuffed beyond belief.<br />
The item of the day was Algonquin Park. Huntsville is a short drive from the massive greenspace, and Allison and I wanted to see it. I&#8217;d never been to Algonquin before (Allison was shocked that I&#8217;d not gone before with friends or family, though that wasn&#8217;t due to lack of interest), and was curious to see what it was like. Allison was itching to see the fall colours (which really don&#8217;t exist here in BC).<br />
The day was warm, so we dressed comfortably. We passed by Huntsville and in just over a half-hour, were entering the south-western entrance to the park. Algonquin Park is huge &#8212; 7,725 square kilometres. Not nearly as large as Wood Buffalo National Park (weighing in at a hefty 44,807 square kilometres), but larger than Prince Albert National Park (3,875 sq. km) and Banff (Bamf!) National Park (6,641 sq. km). We had missed the best time to go through the park (the colour peaked probably a week or two earlier), but it was still magnificent.<br />
After purchasing a day pass from the main gate, we headed for our first stop: Hardwood Trail. This was the shortest one in the park, and was described as &#8220;moderate&#8221;. We took this to mean &#8220;relatively not too bad&#8221;. At only 0.7 kilometres, it didn&#8217;t sound too bad.<br />
In BC, they make trails easy to follow, and will quite frequently build raised platforms and walkways to prevent the trampling and compacting of the ground. In Ontario, they tack little blue circles to trees along the way.<br />
By the time we reached the top of a hill (which gave us a spectacular view over Smoke Lake), we were tired. A lot of it had been crawling up and down hills, carefully walking so you didn&#8217;t plant your foot in a mud pit, and keeping an eye out for rogue tree roots. We passed on any more trails for the day.<br />
We headed further into the park, stopping at the Algonquin Museum about halfway through the park. This gave us an opportunity to view some of the Group of Seven paintings the museum had.<br />
Not far past the museum (still heading east), we realised that we had gone a bit too far, and turned around to head back. Along the way, we stopped at Canoe Lake, site of Tom Thompson&#8217;s tragic death in 1917. The only indication of the lake&#8217;s notoriety was a bronze and blue sign erected near the gift shop and restaurant. I think Allison and I were the only ones who read it.<br />
Following our visit to Canoe Lake, we went into Huntsville, in search of something light to eat. We weren&#8217;t interested in anything heavy &#8212; we were still reeling from the previous night&#8217;s dinner (oh, if we only knew what we were in for). But Ontario is not exactly known for light fare, and certainly not more northern Ontario.<br />
Downtown Huntsville is quite picturesque. It&#8217;s hard to tell if what we saw was genuine, or a carefully constructed charade for the tourists. We drove up the main strip, turned around and headed back (passing my mom and sister in the process) and headed back toward the cottage. We stopped at the Harvey&#8217;s along the way to indulge in a salad.<br />
There were people all over the place when we arrived back at the cottage. As of the previous day, there were 10 people: Cathy, Craig, Dave, Steve, Kathy, Madison (the baby), my parents, Allison, and myself. We now had at least four more (in all honesty, I lost count). So much for a small, cozy Thanksgiving dinner.<br />
Dave had gone overboard with dinner. The turkey was stuffed with apple/raisin/sauage stuffing, there was a ham coated in pineapple/brown sugar glaze (it apparently did a number of the pan), beans that were seemingly cooked in butter (as opposed to water), carrots (the tamest of the items), and mashed potatoes.<br />
No comments about the potatoes, you say? That&#8217;s because it takes a bit to explain them. Take your ordinary potato. Cook a few and mash them with cream and butter. Lots of it. The potatoes should be ultra-creamy. Mix in bacon bits. Real ones. Refrigerate over night. The next morning, scoop out potatoes with an ice cream scoop. Roll the potatoes in flour, then in beaten eggs, then in breading. Deep-fry until the breading is golden brown. Heat in the oven.<br />
I almost wished I hadn&#8217;t learned how those were made. There were sooooo good, but I can never eat them again.<br />
After dinner, we sat around and talked. Craig and Steve set a fire in the back yard. This doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing, until you realise what they were burning: Three mattresses, at least one box spring, several table legs (and possibly the tables), and about 1,000 square feet of carpet.<br />
And this was a small fire. Their other fires have been massive blazes that have actually frightened them. (You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d learn&#8230;) Although I don&#8217;t have hard figures, these are some of the other things these people have burned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two vacuum cleaners</li>
<li>One fibreglass jacuzzi tub</li>
<li>Countless square feet of carpet</li>
<li>Countless board-feet of lumber of all kinds</li>
<li>Leaves. Lots of &#8217;em.</li>
<li>Mattresses. Who knows how many.</li>
<li>27 couches. Yes, 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neighbours don&#8217;t like the cottage group too much.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to three deafening pounds on the bedroom door. Cathy had arrived at the Sowrey homestead, and wasn&#8217;t going to wait for her poor brother (and future sister-in-law) to adjust to the time change. She wanted to start up to the cottage, and she wasn&#8217;t keen on waiting.<br />
The cottage? Cathy&#8217;s significant other (more than a boyfriend, but not quite a husband) owns a cottage just outside of Huntsville. (Huntsville, for those of you without a map, is about 250 kms north of Toronto.) Huntsville&#8217;s claim to fame, aside from being a nice little town, is bringing Shania Twain to the world. She got her start at the Deerhurst Resort, which sits on the eastern edge of town.<br />
Allison and I weren&#8217;t off and running with the bulls that morning, it took us a while to get going. There was a reason for this, of course &#8212; we needed to make a phone call. What&#8217;s so special about that? Well, for one thing, it was to British Columbia, three hours behind Ontario. For another, it would settle our problem with finding a new apartment.<br />
Finally sick to death of the apartment we&#8217;re currently in (lots of noise, endless renovation, and I&#8217;m getting tired of the commute), we started looking for a new place to live. Because of the way our lease is structured, we had to hand in our notice to vacate one month and one day before our last day &#8212; September 30. This was long before we had a place settled.<br />
We had searched high and low through Kitsilano and the West End to find a place. We found a few promising ones, but nothing definite. We were getting a bit uptight about finding an apartment in time before we left for Ontario. Then, on the Tuesday before, we went to see a place in the West End. It sounded promising: Two bedrooms, balcony, view, and a dishwasher. The dishwasher was a big thing for us &#8212; we&#8217;re sick of having our counter space sucked up with a dish rack.<br />
When we arrived, there were several people directly on our heels. It was only because I thought we should get there early that we got there first. Allison whispered in my ear &#8220;we&#8217;ll take it&#8221; after only barely stepping into the apartment. But we had to wait for the manager to show the apartment to two more groups.<br />
The next group bribed her $100 to give the place to them over us. The second group offered $250 more per month. (There were two more groups from Toronto who both offered $350 more than the advertised rent.) I began to understand why prices out here were so out of whack. (In retrospect, Toronto has caught up in the Rent Race as of late.)<br />
We were told that we would find out Thursday morning if we got the apartment. When Thursday morning came, Allison (who accepted the call) discovered that the owner of the apartment (apparently it&#8217;s a condo) was concerned that Allison is self-employed. We&#8217;d expected to run into this problem &#8230; when we bought a house, not renting an apartment. Allison hastily faxed nearly every quasi-financial document that proved she was trustworthy.<br />
The call Friday morning would tell us either A) we got it, or B) we&#8217;d be apartment hunting as soon as we got back. We were hoping it wasn&#8217;t B).<br />
I dialled the management, and asked for Dana, the woman we had been dealing with. (Interesting fact: Almost every single building manager I&#8217;ve dealt with since I got here has been a woman &#8212; only one man.) Her response was: &#8220;Are you ready to sign the contract that says you&#8217;ll take me for two weeks of the year?&#8221;<br />
This is Dana&#8217;s little joke &#8212; she thinks the view at our new apartment is great, and joked that she would like to stay there two weeks of the year when she&#8217;s retired. It&#8217;s harmless &#8230; I hope.<br />
So that brings me to a new point: Our new address information. You might want to jot this down&#8230;<br />
[Information not available on the web. Sorry&#8230;]<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
The whole famn damily (as my dad would say) was going to up to the cottage. Allison and I would pick up my sister, and my parents would drive up in the RoadTrek. We&#8217;d meet either in Huntsville, or at Weber&#8217;s (if we got there at the same time).<br />
Following the simple directions, Allison and I arrived at my sister&#8217;s house. Yes, house. She owns a house with Craig (hence the more-than-boyfriend, not-quite-husband designation). It&#8217;s a nice place, it just needs a little bit of work to make it their own &#8212; they&#8217;ve only been there a couple of months.<br />
And off we went. I drove for the first bit, about 80% of the trip. This took us north of Toronto, through Barrie and Orillia, and finally to Weber&#8217;s, home of the best burgers in Ontario (and possibly the world). As we blitzed north, we passed my parents, who then engaged in a game of &#8220;keep up with the children&#8221;. We met for lunch.<br />
Weber&#8217;s is a landmark in the Muskokas. Everyone travelling north of Orillia on Highway 11 knows about Weber&#8217;s. You can&#8217;t miss it. It&#8217;s the only hamburger joint with it&#8217;s own bridge across the highway (the bridge is the only privately-owned bridge (or walkway) across a highway in Canada &#8212; bought from the CN Tower in the early 80&#8217;s). They serve up to over 110,000 people in one month (up to over 6,000 in one day).<br />
Yes, they&#8217;re *that* good. That&#8217;s why the bridge is there &#8212; to get the southbound traffic.<br />
We arrived at the cottage around 3pm in the afternoon, and were promptly presented with with draught beers. They have a beer fridge, complete with taps in the front. The beer fridge did not last long, however, it was moved downstairs to make room for the pool table.<br />
In turn, the power drill came out. Two holes were bored &#8212; one in the floor, the other in a post that supported the loft. They ran a clear plastic hose from the beer fridge in the basement, up through the floor, and into a beer tap that now occupied the hole in the support post. Beer now flowed from the basement to the kitchen.<br />
(Ever seen those beer commercials where a bunch of 20-somethings romp around in this mythical cottage lifestyle? I think we found the model cottage for those commercials.)<br />
The cottage is two floors, with a loft. The main floor is the kitchen/living and dining area. There are no walls. Except for the ones around the bathroom (kind of a necessity). Downstairs are most of the beds, with walls separating most of the areas, and one room that holds Steve, Kathy, and their baby. The loft is accessed from the living area up a fairly steep ladder. There are numerous mattresses up there, capable of sleeping a large number of people.<br />
Dinner that evening was a roast &#8212; nothing horribly fancy, other than it was a roast. (This was a cottage &#8212; I was expecting hot dogs and hamburgers, maybe a steak.) It came with roasted potatoes and fresh vegetables. All courtesy of &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave.<br />
(There are two, actually three, Daves at this cottage. &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave comes from, you guessed it, Scarborough. This is not to confuse him with &#8220;Huntsville&#8221; Dave, who lives just down the road. The third Dave is my dad. He doesn&#8217;t need a prefix for his name though, he&#8217;s just &#8220;Dave&#8221;.)<br />
Anyway, Scarborough Dave is a cook &#8212; used to own a restaurant. He loves cooking, or so it seems. (Cathy told us that they eat far too well at the cottage.) The meal was quite tasty, but nothing compared to what awaited us the following night.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Allison was supposed to call me when she got downtown. I was a bit concerned that it was 2:00pm, and I hadn&#8217;t heard from her. I was supposed to pick her up at 2:00 at the Stadium Skytrain station. We still had to go over to Kitsilano, pick up a wad of business cards, drive to the airport, park the car, check the bags, eat, and get on the plane. By 4:00pm. Time was running short.<br />
I was half-way to the car when my cell phone rang. I was happy I&#8217;d ducked out when I did. A few minutes later, we were on our way to Kits. One of Allison&#8217;s friends (a graphic designer) had made new cards for Allison, but had left them at her friend&#8217;s place (Allison&#8217;s friend had already left on vacation). We stopped only long enough to pick them up and head towards Granville Street.<br />
The trip down was uneventful. We dropped the car off at the Park N&#8217; Fly, hopped a shuttle, and arrived at the terminal just after 3:00pm. So far, everything was going like clockwork. Figures we&#8217;d be the ones to find the broken gear.<br />
Something told us that we were in for trouble when we stepped up to the counter. I said &#8220;virtual ticket&#8221;, and the clerk&#8217;s eyes glazed over. Even after we&#8217;d produced our identification, it took nearly 20 minutes to check us in. Colour me unimpressed. Allison was convinced this twit didn&#8217;t know how to use a computer. Everything was punched in with two fingers, and it took no less than five minutes to print the lousy boarding pass!<br />
Finally, the luggage accepted, we made a bee-line for Harvey&#8217;s, and some much-needed food. All would have gone well, except for the guy in front of me who ordered nearly everything on the menu. Luckily, Allison was a while getting her magazine, so I finished about the same time she got back.<br />
We weren&#8217;t late arriving at the gate, but the general boarding call was long since called. I felt sorry for the poor woman sitting on the aisle of our row. I think I hit her twice with my bag, and stepped on her toe. I don&#8217;t like having to take two bags on a plane &#8212; too inconvenient.<br />
The flight was pleasant: faster than usual, quite smooth, a good in-flight movie (&#8220;Swing&#8221;), and decent meals. Well, almost decent. Although Canadian Airlines now has much more flavourful meals, they&#8217;ve skimped on a few things. Take dessert for example: It was a Halloween-sized Toblerone bar. What happened to the apple crisp, eh? Or the (somewhat disgusting) cheesecakes?<br />
And the butter. Hello, what&#8217;s wrong with butter? No, they had to give us Becel. Not even decent margarine, but Becel. Blech! It&#8217;s bad enough that I can&#8217;t eat salted peanuts on the flight anymore, but I can&#8217;t have butter now. What is this world coming to?<br />
We arrived in Toronto at 11:00pm EDT, about 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The idea was to grab the bags, grab a taxi, and head home. My dad, however, beat us to it, nearly scaring Allison half to death as we waited for our luggage.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several weeks ago, we received an invitation to a gala event in the Okanagan for one of Allison&#8217;s friends, Heather. She was getting married to her significant other, Brian. We were asked to attend the three-day event in Naramata. (Naramata is, for lack of any better description, suburban Penticton. Penticton, just in case you&#8217;re looking on a map, is at the south end of Okanagan Lake, about 30-40 minutes from Kelowna.)<br />
Allison was considered part of Heather&#8217;s inner circle of friends &#8212; she attended the shower and the stag parties. Now the question you are undoubtedly asking is: How does Allison know Heather? (Okay, maybe you&#8217;re not, but it&#8217;s still interesting.) A couple of years ago, Allison was enrolled in the Young Entrepreneurs Program, of which Heather was the instructor. Yes, Allison was Heather&#8217;s student. One of Heather&#8217;s other friends described Allison as Heather&#8217;s &#8220;most favouritest student&#8221;. (In actuality, Allison often helped in the class, as she was frequently bored with the lack of stimulating or challenging material.)<br />
So from student to peer, Allison was called upon to travel to the Okanagan and witness matrimonial bliss. With a &#8220;guest&#8221;, of course. We took it upon ourselves to use the situation as research for our own event, currently aimed at mid-summer next year (we&#8217;re still working on the exact date).<br />
Because the event was for three days, we hoped we might be able to save a little money by staying a night at Chateau Tisdale in Kelowna. Luckily, the Chateau&#8217;s owners were very accommodating, and loaned us use of the house, even though they were going to Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park.<br />
I love my relatives.<br />
So on Friday afternoon, we threw our things into Allison&#8217;s &#8217;87 Toyota Corolla, shifted in gear, and headed directly to the Bay. I needed a shirt for the event, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to buy one yet. It was a nice light aquamarine (as close a colour as I can think of) and a tie (yes, a tie) to go with it. Then we were off &#8230; once we dropped off a library book.<br />
We drove until we reached outer Abbotsford, at which time we filled up on gas. It was a long drive to Kelowna, and the last think you want to have happen is run out of gas between Hope and Merritt &#8212; 120 kilometres of zilch civilization, and $20/litre gasoline. No, I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; tow trucks will charge you that much, because there&#8217;s no other place to get it.<br />
Aside from a quick stop in Hope to obtain a small dinner, our next stop was in Merritt, where we were in need of something to drink. After you spend a significant amount of time on the coast, you&#8217;ll find your body requires more and more liquid when travelling in drier climates.<br />
As we departed Kelowna, I got a chance to look up at the sky Allison had commented on earlier. It was cool and clear that night &#8212; the clearest sky I have seen in over a decade. And dark. It was so dark that for the first time in since-I-don&#8217;t-know-when, I saw the Milky Way. Across the sky is usually a large whitish band, where we can see the rest of the galaxy. City lights drown it out completely &#8230; but not at 1,100 metres in the dead of night. We pulled over for a while and stared up at the night sky.<br />
Kelowna was cold when we arrived, barely in the teens (we were used to low 20s back in Vancouver). After finding the key stashed in the backyard, we found the house wasn&#8217;t much warmer. It seems my relatives had turned the heat off. Fine with me, as we were getting free accommodation. It just made using certain objects in the house (particularly those in the bathroom) a bit on the &#8230; breathtaking side.<br />
We rose late the night morning, groggy from our long trip. After quick romps through the shower, we headed out to find something to eat. Despite the fact that Kelowna is a neat little resort town, it has one little problem &#8212; a lot of things don&#8217;t open until later in the day. We had hoped to have Mexican for lunch. The only Mexican place we could find didn&#8217;t open until 4:00pm. We ended up at the Earl&#8217;s, overlooking the lake.<br />
Earl&#8217;s isn&#8217;t known for speed. This particular restaurant was stuck in what appeared to be an extension of the Kansas Interspatial Distortion (see Observer&#8217;s Log: Volume 3), where time slowed to a crawl. It took nearly an hour and a half to order, eat, and get our bill. We were 20 minutes late getting to &#8220;Salmon on the Beach&#8221;.<br />
This was the first of three wedding-related events (actually, four, if you count the ceremony and reception as separate). This was the get-together for all the people involved (including guests) in the wedding. There were between 120 and 150 people, but exact numbers were impossible to guess, because we didn&#8217;t know who was a guest and who wasn&#8217;t.<br />
Allison and I were among the youngest in the group, and felt mostly like outsiders. However, we were quickly welcomed by Heather&#8217;s mom, aunt, soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, and numerous other people. We certainly didn&#8217;t feel like outsiders by the end.<br />
The families had commandeered a park in the corner of Naramata, where they set up volleyball nets, horseshoe pits, picnic tables (all courtesy of the town), and food &#8230; lots and lots of food. All of it homemade. Grilled salmon, caught fresh in Port Alberni, along with fresh corn on the cob, salads of nearly every kind, and lots of fresh vegetables. Dessert was a selection of pies made from nearly every imaginable fruit. If you could fend off the wasps long enough, it was a good meal. (No-one was stung, to the best of my knowledge.)<br />
One of the more unexpected events was marked with a sign, reading &#8220;Irish Jigging&#8221;. They were referring to dancing, of course. Problem: &#8220;Jig&#8221; is a word used by the British to describe the Irish dancing. It does not mean the same thing in Ireland. In fact, it refers to the act of procreation. Not exactly what those who wrote the sign had in mind.<br />
We stayed until it was difficult to see the people playing volleyball. It was also so cold we could actually start seeing our breath (of course, that could have been from sucking in too much smoke from the bonfire). Apparently, the volleyball players continued to the point where they couldn&#8217;t see the ball.<br />
On the way back, we debated on what to do with the remainder of the evening. Both of us decided that a movie was in order. We hoped to be back in downtown Kelowna in time for a movie, but we weren&#8217;t certain we could make it. Luckily for us, we passed by the Westbank Caprice Theatres, which was showing a wide range of movies. Opting for the immediate guarantee of a movie, we stopped.<br />
We ended up seeing a rather appropriate film, insofar as the basic event that was to take place the following day &#8212; Runaway Bride, starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Given, we didn&#8217;t expect to see Heather making a 100 metre dash away from the altar the next day, but we figured it would be good for a laugh.<br />
I&#8217;d just like to go on record: I didn&#8217;t suggest the movie. I merely agreed to it.<br />
Twenty dollars and two hours of our lives that we&#8217;ll never see again (Allison and I hit the &#8220;why are we watching this drivel&#8221; point at the same time, however we also realized that we had nothing else better to do, so we stayed and watched), we returned home, and promptly passed out.<br />
We were off and running early the next morning, making a direct hit on the De Dutch Pannekoek house. It was an experiment the both of us had been interested in performing. We had heard good things about the place, and thought it might be good for a test run. All in all, our spur-of-the-moment decisions to try something that weekend turned out fairly lousy &#8230; the breakfast included.<br />
I dropped Allison off at home, and quickly made a run to the Summerhill Winery, about a kilometre or so away from Chateau Tisdale. I figured that the loan of the entire house was worth at least two bottles of nice wine. Sadly, our once-favourite winery was nearly out of stock (the fall wine season is just about to start, and the spring lineup is almost gone). Remembering the St. Hubertus Winery not too far away, I made a hasty exit to check there.<br />
As usual, the St. Hubertus Winery was empty &#8230; of people, that is. It&#8217;s one of those little treasures that not many people know about. I knew exactly was I was looking for: a bottle of Oak Bay Gamay Noir (a very tasty red) and a recommended white wine. I learned something that day: Ageing wine in oak barrels means a lot. St. Hubertus has two flavours of Gamay Noir &#8212; one aged in stainless steel, the other in oak. The oak tastes significantly better. If the label says &#8220;Vinters Reserve&#8221;, you&#8217;ve got the *wrong* one.<br />
Returning after 20 minutes, toting two bottles of wine, I quickly got to work getting ready to leave. That meant showering, shaving, packing, and taking the wrinkles out of my new shirt. That was a challenge that completely amazed me. It took forever. Finally, after much work, the wrinkles were mostly removed, and we darted out the door. We were a bit pressed for time.<br />
The wedding was at 3:30 (or so said the invitation). That meant moving quickly, as it takes an hour (at least) to get from Kelowna to Naramata. This is mostly because of the zillion or so curves and dips along Naramata Road. Luckily, we were provided with a map that gave us the location. After thinking we might have got lost (we weren&#8217;t alone on that point), we found Heather&#8217;s grandparent&#8217;s house, half-way up the side of the mountain.<br />
Wow.<br />
Let me repeat that &#8212; wow.<br />
A nicer home, I have not seen. I couldn&#8217;t tell you when it was built, but someone made a careful plan to make sure that every possible vista was exploited. There isn&#8217;t one square inch on that property, in or out of the house, that doesn&#8217;t have a killer view.<br />
The ceremony was held on the spacious driveway/walkway that overlooked the lake and surrounding hillsides. Although it had been raining all day, the sun&#8217;s appearance only 30 minutes before was making the event a very memorable one.<br />
Brian and his entourage appeared roughly 10 minutes after we arrived, followed by Heather about five minutes later. The ceremony itself was short, lasting only about 15 minutes in total length. That&#8217;s not including the &#8220;intermission&#8221; in the middle, where Brian and Heather went off to sign the marriage licence, then returning to finish the ceremony. A little strange, if you ask me.<br />
Afterwards, we got into a receiving line to greet the wedding party and the newlyweds. This something that Allison and I are considering avoiding. It&#8217;s a long, drawn out detail that uses a lot of time that we think could be put to better use &#8230; like pictures, or getting from Point A to Point B (this all depends on where we have our photos taken, of course).<br />
Punch and hors d&#8217;oeuvres followed. Then it was back to Penticton for the reception at the Ramada. This gave us some time to whip through our hotel and drop our things off. We had checked in on our way up to Naramata, but didn&#8217;t want to spend the time unloading items. Not that it really mattered&#8230;<br />
The reception was more research for us. Allison had me take pictures of the cake, head table, and one of the guest tables for reference. We also realized that the room isn&#8217;t that big an issue &#8212; it really doesn&#8217;t dominate the atmosphere. We thought about how we would arrange people, where we would put food, what kind of drinks we would serve (and where we&#8217;d get them), and so on and so on.<br />
Our table mates included a couple who were loosely related to Heather (no blood relation at all, but were nonetheless a valued part of the family), named Micki and Donald. Yes, you read that right. They commented on the oddness of the two names. We noted it was a little weird that they didn&#8217;t go by something like Mick and Don. But hey &#8212; they&#8217;re not us.<br />
The dinner was quite nice, including a couple of salads (green, potato, and pasta), chicken kiev, roast beef, and buns. The cake was delicious, even though I had no idea what it was.<br />
When it finally came time to dance, the silliness started. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that about 50% of those attending were sufficiently inebriated. One in particular, one of Brian&#8217;s friends, claimed he was &#8220;a professional alcoholic&#8221;. This, as he bought nine beers and two rum and cokes (he was using up $50 he didn&#8217;t want to convert before returning to Ireland).<br />
Anyway, back to the dancing. Lots of people danced silly dances, including the dreaded &#8220;Chicken Dance&#8221;. That&#8217;s #1 of the top 10 songs I will try with all my might to keep out of our wedding. The Macarena comes in at #2. They played that, too. Dance I did not, owing to the severe pain my shoes were inflicting on my left little toe. Mental note for next year: Do not wear sandals in the week prior to the wedding &#8212; my toes are a little too splayed to fit into dress shoes properly.<br />
The reception ended around 1am, at which time we returned to our motel, and hit the sack.<br />
The next morning was supposed to be the brunch, where all those involved could scarf down a tasty way to start the day. We thought about the traffic we would face, and opted instead to get a head start on the mayhem. We didn&#8217;t avoid the idiots, though, nearly missing one such idiot as he tried to pass another car on a hill, with us next to a cliff. We had a maximum of two feet to spare between us. It really got the ol&#8217; heart pumping.<br />
The trip back signified the end of summer. As we climbed through the mountains, we noticed that it was dark and dreary &#8212; just what winter looks like around here. Then it started to rain. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, it&#8217;s only water. After a moment, I noticed that the rain wasn&#8217;t splattering like rain &#8230; it was sleet. Not even before I said: &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s sleet!&#8221; did the sleet become snow. Not just a little snow, a *lot* of snow. So much snow that the windshield wipers gummed up, and we accumulated a bit on the car.<br />
Yes folks, when you see snow falling around you, you know summer&#8217;s over.<br />
We drove until we reached Abbotsford, where we pulled off for lunch. Again, our trend of turtle-paced service continued, for what reason we didn&#8217;t know. After an hour, we resumed our trek west.<br />
Our option to leave early paid off, we avoided the traffic we had dreaded. We pulled into our parking garage, and let Allison&#8217;s car recover from its 1000+ km journey. The drive probably did it well, though &#8212; it&#8217;s primarily used for city driving.<br />
That evening, we went downtown to witness Mary, a band fronted by the sister of one of Allison&#8217;s friends. It was a good show, save for the volume differential between the drummer and the vocals (namely the former mostly drowned out the latter). Then it was home for a rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Stress. I hate it. It sucks the life right out of me, and leaves nothing but exhaustion and bad moods. In short, I don&#8217;t do well under a large amount of it for a long period of time. And when you consider that I haven&#8217;t been working weekends, I&#8217;m really wondering how I survived at Arkipelago for so long without going loony.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much the direction I&#8217;m headed in now &#8212; loony. Rather, I was, until the weekend. I&#8217;ve been busting my rear as of late &#8230; actually, as of the last two months, trying to get about a dozen projects to completion. Of prominence was the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit report. It&#8217;s worth about 3/4 of a million to us, so needless to say, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure to get it done.<br />
And that&#8217;s the problem &#8212; pressure. I&#8217;m under way too much of it. So much so that I haven&#8217;t slept well in more weeks than I can remember, and what little time I&#8217;ve had all to myself has been taken up by commuting from home to work and back.<br />
I need a vacation. Badly.<br />
Regrettably, my vacation won&#8217;t likely come until early October, when I plan to make a visit home. So until then, I take my rest time whenever I can get it. To compensate for my most recent bout of near-crazed stress, Allison and I opted to visit the Island for the weekend.<br />
Unlike our usual habit, we drove the car to the Island (via the ferry, of course). We caught the last ferry out of Vancouver, which unlike normal, was full of people returning from the PNE. Not a total surprise &#8212; getting to the PNE from the Island is a bit difficult, but not impossible for the determined.<br />
We arrived at the Collins&#8217; just around 11:30pm, at which time we sat down and talked for a while. Jane arrived after not too long, said &#8220;Hello&#8221; and promptly vanished. Randy came home not long after Jane, but stayed around to talk. Before long, it was well after 2:00am, and we were ready to pass out.<br />
The next morning, the house was virtually empty. The Collins were out with friends, and Allison&#8217;s siblings were nowhere to be found. It was time for us to vacate for our excursion of the day.<br />
The West Coast. Since I arrived in Vancouver in January of 1998, I hadn&#8217;t been to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Sounds a little odd, perhaps? While the Island is not very wide (only a hundred kilometres or so), there is no direct east-west highway. This is because of a small mountain problem.<br />
Getting to Tofino (one of our ultimate destinations) from Nanaimo requires a drive to Parkville, then to Port Alberni, then to Ucuelet, and finally to Tofino. All in all, it&#8217;s about 250 kilometres. There&#8217;s no way to do that in less than three hours.<br />
Unless you&#8217;re a raving lunatic, of course.<br />
The drive to Port Alberni is nice and easy &#8212; I&#8217;ve done most of it before (it&#8217;s the same route to Cathedral Grove). But once you&#8217;re out of Port Alberni, you&#8217;re into rough country. The roads weave, rise and fall like a roller coaster. The only difference is that you&#8217;re not attached to the track, and you have to deal with trains going in the opposite direction and trains trying to run you off the road.<br />
Since I&#8217;ve arrived here, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that BC has some of the worst drivers in Canada. At least in Montreal, everyone expects you to drive like a maniac. Many people have suggested that &#8220;flat-landers&#8221; (aka everyone who came from east of the Rockies) can&#8217;t drive here &#8212; they drive too fast, they take turns to quickly, yadda yadda yadda. Given, I see a lot of out-of-province license plates on cars driving so fast it would make Mario Andretti queasy. But my general fear is of the freaks that are living in this province.<br />
Anyway, we managed to finally get to Ucuelet shortly after 2:00pm. Starving, we found our way to a small grocery store to purchase snacks. We had thought of a restaurant, but Ucuelet (population: 5) isn&#8217;t well-stocked with interesting places to eat.<br />
Okay, all seriousness aside, Ucuelet is a nice place. To visit. I wouldn&#8217;t want to live there. Allison&#8217;s cousin, however, does. Her husband is the town planner. You might think: &#8220;Why would a town that small require a town planner?&#8221; The answer to that is our second destination: Tofino.<br />
Tofino was once like Ucuelet &#8212; small. Tiny. A blip on the map that you couldn&#8217;t get to without traversing gravel logging roads. It was an ordeal that few took. Then the government (bless their souls) paved the aforementioned logging road, and designated it Highway 4. Suddenly, getting from one side of the Island to the other was a bit easier. And Tofino was conveniently situated not far from Long Beach, which has some of the best surfing in Canada.<br />
That&#8217;s why Tofino got bigger. It got big fast. According to many who told me, Tofino also sprawled. It went commercial. It didn&#8217;t have that &#8220;west coast feel&#8221;. Ucuelet, only 40 kilometres away (and much closer to the Highway to Civilization) opted not to become an eyesore. Hence, the town planner.<br />
That being said, we figured Tofino had more to offer in terms of lunch, albeit a late one. So off we went.<br />
Between Ucuelet and Tofino is Pacific Rim National Park. It protects Long Beach and the surrounding area. There are several areas to visit in the park, but on that particular day, we were only interested in getting to Tofino.<br />
At first, I thought we had arrived in the outer limits of the town. From what others had told me, Tofino was a sprawling mess. I expected McDonald&#8217;s restaurants, gas stations &#8212; all the tacky stuff you&#8217;d expect to see in a tourist town. Frankly, I&#8217;d love to know what everyone complains about.<br />
Tofino is &#8230; quaint. Yes, quaint is exactly the word I&#8217;d use. It&#8217;s small, compact, with no real &#8220;strip&#8221; to speak of. It takes about a minute to travel from one side to the other. Then you&#8217;ve seen it, and you can move on with life.<br />
Tofino is more-or-less in the centre of Clayquot Sound. Name sound familiar? Remember all the protests a few years back? This was one of the centres for the protesters. Clayquot Sound has a lot of temperate rainforest &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest in North America, logged areas not included. It&#8217;s also the wettest &#8230; 20 feet a year. Luckily, we only got drizzled on.<br />
Lunch being the major concern, we drove around briefly (like I said, the town is small), until we spotted the Sea Shanty. Perhaps not the most elegant name, but they serve a mean shrimp caesar wrap. Not that I ate one &#8212; Allison did, complete with the fanciest salad I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. I opted for a rather large bowl of clam chowder (not that I had the intention of ordering a large bowl, it just came that way) and a small caesar salad. Both of us were quite content with our meals, especially considering how cheap they were.<br />
So, there&#8217;s my commercial for this issue &#8212; if you&#8217;re in Tofino and you&#8217;re hungry, go for the Sea Shanty.<br />
Afterwards, we wandered about a bit, checking out some of the local stores, before we ended up at the Eagle Aerie Gallery. This is Roy H. Vickers&#8217; personal art gallery. Roy Vickers is possibly one of the most famous (living) artists on the West Coast. He lives and works here, living in some remote town on the Island, with his gallery in Tofino.<br />
He&#8217;s a Tsimshian artist who creates beautiful artwork with Native themes. His artwork frequently requires the use of special lighting so you get the full effect (sometimes you can&#8217;t see a feature unless you&#8217;re looking in the right angle). Allison and I would love to buy a print of his, except we can&#8217;t spare the $3000.<br />
Upon exiting, Allison suggested we go to Long Beach. The sun was beginning to break through the oppressive cloud cover, so a trip to the beach seemed like a good idea.<br />
Long Beach is aptly named &#8212; it&#8217;s a few miles in length. But don&#8217;t be mistaken &#8212; this isn&#8217;t your average beach. In fact, this isn&#8217;t your average coast. The west coast of Vancouver Island is quite dangerous. There are vicious rip currents, rogue waves, and storms that make The Blair Witch Project look like Barney and Friends reunion. Many people are killed each year who don&#8217;t heed warnings or take the right precautions.<br />
The water is also cold. About 52F (11C) degrees. Unless you&#8217;re wearing a wetsuit, it&#8217;s not the sort of thing you want to be splashing around in for any length of time. Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop Allison or I from romping around the waves &#8230; so long as they didn&#8217;t pass our knees.<br />
But even at such a shallow depth, you can feel the rip current. Normally, when you stand in the sand where waves hit the beach, the sand under your feet is eaten away and you sink. That effect is very pronounced at Long Beach. Still, there were many people out surfing in the waves.<br />
We stayed only about 45 minutes, realising that if we stayed much longer, it would be dark by the time we got back to Nanaimo &#8212; and the trip back isn&#8217;t one you want to take in the dark.<br />
We stopped for a short while in Port Alberni, partially because we wanted to see the infamous channel. This is a large fjord that runs more than half-way into Vancouver Island. Originally, it didn&#8217;t quite go all the way through to Port Alberni, but some simple dredging and blasting took care of that. Now Port Alberni is actually a shipping port, allowing ships to avoid the bottlenecks at Vancouver Harbour.<br />
Returning to Nanaimo, we found we were unable to find a restaurant to suit our culinary desires. As such, we ended up back at the Collins, ordering Domino&#8217;s Pizza. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, of course.<br />
The next morning, I was awakened by the sound of a ringing telephone. At the time I didn&#8217;t know it, but it was in fact Allison doing a loop-back call with the phone so she wouldn&#8217;t have to go downstairs and wake me up. She was lucky that I was ready to get up anyway &#8212; I would&#8217;ve probably gone back to sleep, otherwise.<br />
We were out of the house about five minutes later, heading to Wellington Hall. Mrs. Collins wanted to experiment with some ideas for the wedding.<br />
Oh yeah, you probably wonder about that, eh? We put it off, due to some extenuating circumstances, and have rescheduled for next year, either in late July or early September (August is out due to Allison&#8217;s cousin, who is also getting married), depending on whether Allison decides to do her Masters or not.<br />
We&#8217;ll let you know.<br />
Anyway, we then ended up in Wedding Research mode, visiting several places around Nanaimo before finally giving up for the day. Still not enough decisions, but we&#8217;re not too pressed for time.<br />
Getting home was another issue. We hoped to make the 7pm ferry &#8230; along with about 500 other cars. We ended up in a line the lengths of which I hadn&#8217;t even imagined, let alone experienced. Surprisingly enough, it went fairly quickly, and we managed to make the special 8pm sailing (BC Ferries will run periodic special runs when traffic is high).<br />
It was a Fast Ferry. Yay. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as our previous experience, but then again, the Fast Ferry excels at the Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay run &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have to turn around.<br />
Soon, we were home, resting up for another week of solid work. Next week &#8212; off to Naramata for a wedding. Yep, another log entry&#8217;s a-coming&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another birthday has come and gone, and save for a minor panic attack when I realised I wasn&#8217;t 21 anymore (yes, that <em>actually</em> happened, believe it or not), I&#8217;m doing okay.<br />
Things got off to a start on Friday, when Pure3D (my group at the office) went out to celebrate two birthdays &#8212; mine (obviously), and Neall, who is exactly one day older than me. (Although Neall&#8217;s birthday was the day before, we really didn&#8217;t get our act in gear to go out for lunch that day; we rolled two birthdays into one.)<br />
I was supposed to go to a softball game that night, but I opted not to go, rather wanting to spend some time with Allison doing something other than sitting at home, working on the computer or watching a movie. (No, we haven&#8217;t been out a lot as of late.)<br />
After making a quick trip to Burnaby to pick up Allison, we came downtown to go to our favourite Greek restaurant, Olympia, on Denman St. (Yes, Allison could have come downtown and saved me the trip, but I didn&#8217;t make up my mind until I got home.) Tyler joined us towards the end of our evening meal (having already had his dinner).<br />
The three of us wandered about the Denman Street area for a while, before ending up at Death By Chocolate for dessert. (It&#8217;s actually kiddie-corner to Olympia, but we didn&#8217;t want to stuff ourselves any fuller at the time.) Following dessert, we adjourned to Tyler&#8217;s place to continue with our in-depth conversation. Unfortunately, we strayed back onto the dreaded Theory of Relativity issue (see [[Canada Day in Kelowna, Winery Tours, and Penticton]]).<br />
The next morning, we headed out on our adventure of the day. For my birthday, Allison was taking me on the Royal Hudson. The Royal Hudson is a train of vintage cars driven by a steam-powered locomotive built in 1940. The locomotive is a 4-6-4 Hudson, number 2860. King George VI was very impressed by the locomotive&#8217;s performance when he and Queen Elizabeth (aka the Queen Mother) travelled across Canada by train in 1939. He bestowed the designation of &#8220;Royal&#8221; on the engine.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what they tell tourists. In reality, CP applied for permission to use the royal crowns and the &#8220;Royal&#8221; moniker to increase revenues by promoting a &#8220;royal&#8221; train. In fact, the entire 2860 class (numbers 2860-2864) all had the designation &#8220;Royal&#8221;.<br />
Despite its Royal lineage, the locomotive was taken out of service in the 50s, and put on freight service until the mid-60s. At that point, she was destined for museums. In the early 70s, enthusiasts convinced BC Rail that they should resurrect the Royal Hudson, and put it into regular service as a tourist train. The Royal Hudson now runs between May and October, running a short length of BC Rail&#8217;s track (BC Rail is the third largest Canadian railway after CP and CN) between North Vancouver and Squamish.<br />
We arrived about 15 minutes before departure, and hastily took our place on board in the end car, where we would have brunch. A few minutes later, the train softly lurched forward, and we were off.<br />
This part of the trip I had been on before &#8212; Allison had taken me on the Pacific Starlight last year (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]). Unlike the Starlight, however, this was a day-time excursion, and the trip ended in Squamish, not in Porteau Cove.<br />
Brunch began with a fruit cup, made of chunks of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple. We finished the cup just before entering West Vancouver. Apparently, we weren&#8217;t supposed to eat while waving to all the onlookers.<br />
The Royal Hudson, like most steam trains, attracts a lot of attention, even if the train makes two trips through West Van every day. It&#8217;s the only train allowed to blow its whistle. Another bizarre bylaw makes everyone wave at the train as it goes by, which forces everyone on the train to wave back.<br />
As we approached Horseshoe Bay, we were treated to the entrée: A large piece of freshly broiled salmon (it was about 1.5&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 5&#8243; in size). It rested on a thin slice of fresh focaccia bread, over a baby green salad with basalmic vinaigrette. The salmon was very good. Allison debated over whether it was better than last year&#8217;s salmon. It was certainly different &#8212; Allison thought it was better, whereas I thought it was on par; I thought last year&#8217;s fish was excellent.<br />
Dessert arrived around Porteau Cove &#8212; trifle. Unlike my father&#8217;s, which has a bottle of brandy (or sherry &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember which is it) at the bottom, this was cake, fruit, and custard. It was very tasty. This isn&#8217;t to say that my father&#8217;s trifle isn&#8217;t tasty &#8212; goodness knows he *loves* it &#8212; but this one was alcohol-free.<br />
Arriving in Squamish, we had several options. BC Rail makes a point of flogging the tourism on the Royal Hudson as much as possible. They even go so far as to hire tour operators to come on board and convince people to go on tours around Squamish, including a trip to Shannon Falls, a river-rafting tour, or flights over the nearby glacier. All of them are designed to fit into the two hours you have before the train departs.<br />
We opted for the tour that came with the price of the ticket &#8212; a visit to the West Coast Railway Heritage Museum, operated by the West Coast Railway Association. To get there, we piled into a vintage 1950s bus, which had scarcely put on 170,000 miles, and were whisked away to a train-lover&#8217;s paradise.<br />
The WCRHM is a 12 acre park, not far from the downtown terminus for Squamish. It sits just to the side of the main north-south BC Rail lines, facilitating easy delivery of new acquisitions.<br />
The park has many examples of old rolling stock (rail cars, passenger cars) and locomotives. It has the only remaining PGE steam train (the other two are lying at the bottom of lakes), one of the original diesel locomotives used to haul CP&#8217;s Canadian transcontinental train, and even a vintage 1890 business car (the equivalent of today&#8217;s LearJets).<br />
Trains aren&#8217;t Allison&#8217;s cup of tea, that much I&#8217;m certain of. But she let me have my day, even allowing me the joy of riding on a miniature railway (which cost a mere dollar per person). I enjoyed the whole day so much, I&#8217;m seriously considering joining the WCRA as a volunteer. Railways are a huge part of our modern society&#8217;s past, and I want to help them have a future.<br />
Filing back onto another bus, we returned to the Royal Hudson at about 1:15. As we couldn&#8217;t board until 1:30, I took the opportunity to take some pictures of the engine and the train. In fact, I took an entire roll of film that day. (Those of you who don&#8217;t know me that well should know that this isn&#8217;t an unusual thing for me &#8212; I tend to be a bit shutter-happy.)<br />
The return trip was almost as good as the trip up. This time, we were one car behind the engine. The whole way back, I could hear the chugging of the engine. Several times I went to the vestibules (the &#8220;doors&#8221; to enter the cars from the platform) to stick my head out and listen. I&#8217;m still washing out bits of sand and carbon from my hair&#8230;<br />
I was almost disappointed when we arrived back in North Vancouver, the trip over. Those trips always seem to go too quickly. We climbed down from the train, and make our way towards our car. The next stop was Horseshoe Bay, and off to the Island.<br />
Arriving at the Bay, I quickly noticed a problem &#8212; there was very little parking. In fact, after dropping off Allison and driving around a bit, I realised that there was no parking at all. Impark (the parking Nazis in the Lower Mainland) had even gone so far as to deny ferry passengers parking rights at one of the major lots.<br />
At first, I didn&#8217;t think we would make that ferry. Parking was limited. Luckily for us, at the time I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d make it, the ferry traffic was beginning to clear out. In other words, parking spots. Unluckily for us, it was in the most expensive lot: $10 a day.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo, we were picked up by the Collins (as usual) and taken home. Allison and I then stepped out for a while for dinner, allowing me to develop the pictures I&#8217;d taken earlier in the day.<br />
Returning home, I was ambushed by the Collins with a steam locomotive-shaped chocolate cake. Yes, I was a very happy camper that night. I had everything I wanted for my birthday &#8230; except my own family and friends, that is. Luckily for me, most of them sent me cards (both the traditional and the newer electronic variety).<br />
The next day was the day we had come to the Island for: The Comox Air Show. No, this is not a regular Collins (or Vailmont) family event. The only reason we were going (in fact, the only reason I knew there was a Comox Air Show) was Allison&#8217;s uncle Sean.<br />
Sgt. Sean Moran is one of an elite skydiving team called the &#8220;Skyhawks&#8221;. They&#8217;re the parachuting equivalent to the Snowbirds. Sean was one of eight people selected for a year&#8217;s service with the squad. Since May, he&#8217;s been jumping all over North America, including a drop in Oakville on 22 June.<br />
Piling into the Collins&#8217; Honda, we hit the road for the 1.5 hour trip to Comox. Upon arriving, we had another 1.5 hour wait until we got in. Unfortunately, we had taken the &#8220;front&#8221; door route &#8212; the one that was clearly marked. This was the &#8220;opposite&#8221; route to how Gerry and I had gone two years ago &#8212; the &#8220;back&#8221; route.<br />
So, along with about 10,000 other cars, we waited our turn to get into CFB Comox&#8217; field. At one point, we sat for a long time without moving. At first, I thought it was because there were complete idiots who didn&#8217;t know how to organise traffic. I would later find out it was because Allison&#8217;s Aunt Valerie&#8217;s friend Peter&#8217;s car broke down. He would later drive by us on his way home to get it fixed.<br />
Around 12:15, we finally reached the fence surrounding the field. A Buffalo (aircraft, not a mammal) circled above us. As we approached the gate, it dumped three streamers, which fell slowly to the ground. I suspected that it was to test the wind conditions for the Skyhawks. I was right &#8212; little did we know at the time, but Sean and crew were all in the Buffalo, waiting to jump.<br />
Before I progress any further, I should clear something up. Sean is younger than you think he is. He is married to Allison&#8217;s aunt Linda, who is only five years older than Allison &#8212; Sean&#8217;s only about five years older than me. Just in case some of you thought he&#8217;s some old geezer leaping from planes for a kick&#8230;<br />
Finally arriving in the base, we took a few minutes to stroll about. We went past some F-16s, some A-10s (which, last I heard, had been decommissioned), gliders, a C5 Galaxy, a couple of helicopters, and a small city worth of people.<br />
On our way to the field to sit and watch, the show started with one of the Skyhawks floating into the field, carrying an American flag underneath him. (Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s good reason for this &#8212; it was an &#8220;international&#8221; air show, which means the US Air Force had supplied a few planes for show.) He was quickly followed by another Skyhawk carrying a Canadian flag. This was kind of redundant, since all the Skyhawks have Canadian flag parachutes.<br />
Aside: For those of you who watch &#8220;Due South&#8221;, you may remember a series of Mounties who parachuted into the frozen north in the final episode, all with Canadian flag parachutes. I&#8217;ll give you two guesses who did the actual jumps. And no, Sean wasn&#8217;t with them at the time.<br />
No sooner had we taken our position that the next few Skyhawks came down, from a distance of 10,000 feet. The first few came in a stacked tower formation (one on top of the other). Another came down carrying smoke canisters under him. He flew into a spiral (on purpose) to create a &#8220;candy cane&#8221; swirling effect.<br />
Four more skydivers formed a diamond with their parachutes, at which point we heard Sean&#8217;s name come over the PA system. Although we cheered, we didn&#8217;t hear anyone else &#8212; I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d be able to hear the others cheer. As it turns out, finding them wasn&#8217;t a problem. I just followed Sean to where he landed &#8212; the rest of the family was there, waiting.<br />
Most of the family (at least from what I gather) was nervous &#8212; after all, he was jumping out of plane. How many people do that in the right minds? I, however, wasn&#8217;t the least bit worried. Now, this could partly be because I&#8217;d only seen Sean twice, and really don&#8217;t know him that well. However, I also knew that these were consummate professionals, who didn&#8217;t like taking risks. The odds of something going wrong were reasonably slim.<br />
After Sean collected his parachute, he and the rest of the team bounded over the fence (as well as someone carrying 30lbs of parachute can bound) and held an impromptu demonstration of how to pack a parachute back up. It was rather fascinating. We basically ignored the rest of the air show until Sean left, to go see the sponsors.<br />
Sean would return later in the show, taking Allison&#8217;s grandfather to the area reserved for base personnel and their family for a surprise presentation. I tagged along to take pictures.<br />
Sean had the Skyhawks sign a special poster, and place a sticker that said &#8220;Happy 80th Ernest&#8221;. In a quick ceremony, the captain of the team presented the poster to Allison&#8217;s grandfather, who was quite touched by the gesture.<br />
Skyhawks are brutally nice. Of course, they have to be &#8212; their ambassadors for the Canadian Armed Forces. They are effectively in media relations. Sean&#8217;s quite good at it, too. He rather likes it, so he told me. They were so nice as to sign brochures for us. Sean goes down as the first person I&#8217;d ever asked for an autograph.<br />
The Snowbirds were the last event of the show. In typical Snowbird-style, they put on a great show. We didn&#8217;t stay around for the whole event, however, as we had to catch a ferry home. We ducked out while they were still flying about. It almost felt like the Snowbirds were running cover for us as we drove out the exit.<br />
We returned to Nanaimo and prepared to leave for the ferry. We lucked out with another Ferry Classic, which meant we&#8217;d have good seating. Our trip was even complete with celebrities. Rather, celebrity.<br />
As I returned from the galley with empty hands (they had no frozen yoghurt on that trip), I caught the face of an elderly Asian man walking in my direction. It took me only a moment to realise that it was David Suzuki. <em>The</em> David Suzuki. Mr. Nature of Things. Allison was looking at me, her eyes bugged open, nodding vigorously, as if in agreement with the question I was apparently supposed to be asking, namely: &#8220;Is that who I think it is?&#8221;<br />
Upon reaching Horseshoe Bay, we exited the ferry, found the car, and dragged ourselves home.<br />
It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks, and we haven&#8217;t had a chance to slow down. Both Allison and I were exhausted when we got home. Although we had been planning to see the Nanaimo Bathtub Races this weekend, we&#8217;re probably not going to go, opting for some rest.<br />
Besides, it&#8217;s my turn to clean the apartment this weekend&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life&#8217;s a beach.<br />
At least, it should be.<br />
Last weekend was the second busy weekend for Allison and I, the second weekend of the month we weren&#8217;t home. We won&#8217;t be home for a weekend probably until mid-August at the pace things are currently going. Every weekend has something new for us to explore. Frankly, this is a good thing &#8230; provided the weather holds out.<br />
We left on Friday night, meeting at Horseshoe Bay. Knowing that traffic would be a nightmare, Allison left from the apartment early. I left downtown on the 5:07 express to Horseshoe Bay, arriving a mere five minutes before Allison.<br />
We dropped the car off at the Park and Ride, which the local Lion&#8217;s Club. Normally, the lot is free, you just have to walk the kilometre or so to the ferry terminal. When the Lion&#8217;s are about, you have to pay a paltry $5/day (a bargain compared to the other lots), and you get a free ride to the terminal.<br />
We were somewhat excited to find that we would be taking one of the mythical Fast Ferries, the first of which went into service on 1 July. It was supposed to leave at 18:00. We boarded it at 18:07. Needless to say, the Fast Ferry hasn&#8217;t been running exactly up to snuff just yet&#8230;<br />
The Fast Ferry is a catamaran with twin water jet propulsion systems. They run at a supposed 45 knots, making the trip in just under an hour. Supposedly. In actuality, it runs at about 37 knots, and in the long run, might save you about five minutes, all told. Why?<br />
Because we let the government design it, that&#8217;s why.<br />
All fairness aside, they did try. But as Yoda once said: &#8220;Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.&#8221; The design would work well for longer-haul trips. However, the design is not exactly well-suited to the short jaunts across the Strait. You see &#8212; the ship points in only one direction.<br />
Why is that significant? All the other ships point in two directions, allowing them to be driven from either end. No turning, no slowing down to back in; just straight-forward (no pun intended) driving. The Fast Ferry is a uni-directional ship. It has to be turned around before it can go anywhere. It needs a dollar to turn on a dime.<br />
This means that for one leg of the trip, the ship has to turn around at both ends &#8212; otherwise, the cars can&#8217;t get off without backing up themselves. As it stands, it takes too long to empty the ship without people having to drive off in reverse.<br />
And the wake. Homeowners around Bowen Island (which the ferries all pass) have been shocked at the near-tsunami conditions that the ferry generates. It threatens to rip up docks and smash boats against the shore. BC Ferries contends that the wake is minimal.<br />
Minimal, my heiny&#8230;<br />
On the way back, we were on a good ol&#8217; regular ferry. When the Fast Ferry rocketed past us, it sent our ship rocking &#8212; the only time in dozens of crossing that Allison and I have been on where I could actually feel the ship rock due to waves.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me started on the interior &#8220;features&#8221; either. I&#8217;ll just leave my opinion at this: The government would have been far better off spending the money on upgrading our existing ferries and making sure that the less-travelled (but still necessary) routes don&#8217;t suffer due to lack of funds. Heck, you could have built two regular ferries for the price it cost to build one Fast Ferry.<br />
And there are two more coming off the assembly line.<br />
Anyway, we arrived in Nanaimo about one hour and 20 minutes after we left West Vancouver and proceeded to the Collins Family Estate, in the prestigious Divers Lake area. There we were subdued by the plethora of relatives who had descended on the household for the weekend.<br />
It was Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday party. The second one. As you may recall (see [[Snow in Vancouver, Dinner on the Island]]), we had already attended a birthday party at The Grotto in Nanaimo. However, it wasn&#8217;t exactly suitable for a large get-together of friends, so the official party was postponed until the weekend past.<br />
The following morning, we rose and dressed for the occasion. Although not a formal event, we were obviously not going to show up in loud pink shirts and spandex shorts, so we dressed in beige pants and blue shirts.<br />
I&#8217;m not kidding. We really did.<br />
This, of course, was an accident. Neither Allison or I had heard each other the night we packed to leave &#8212; we had inadvertently packed virtually the same outfit. This is not just a fashion faux pas &#8212; it looks really weird. So avoid confusion and embarrassment, I raided Randy&#8217;s closet for a different shirt. It turned out that I grabbed a shirt that Randy had never worn &#8212; it has just been given to him from Mr. Collins. Luckily, though, it fit.<br />
Overall, it was a good party, although Allison and I didn&#8217;t move around too much, we spent most of our time talking to old friends of family (that I didn&#8217;t know), cousins, and Grandma Collins. We didn&#8217;t really know many others.  Late in the afternoon, Grandma Vailmont (the one basically running the whole show) abducted me to play bocci.<br />
Bocci is a bit of a religion there. You can&#8217;t escape it. If you go to a Vailmont family get-together, you&#8217;ll probably end up playing bocci. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t know how &#8212; you&#8217;ll learn. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t like it &#8212; you will. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you have no arms &#8212; someone will throw for you. Resistance is futile.<br />
I ended up on a team with Janet, Mrs. Collins&#8217; cousin, and two of Allison&#8217;s cousins, Kersten (9) and Mitchell (4). Both are young. Like most siblings, they fight a fair bit.<br />
I will wholeheartedly admit that I forgot was sibling rivalry was like &#8212; it had been a very long time since my sister and I had a good screaming match. (We now sit around the kitchen table, drink beer, and discuss finances. My how the times change.)<br />
It was exceptionally difficult to play a close game. If one side got too far ahead, one of the two siblings would be upset. Janet and I got very good at placing balls close to the marker ball, and far away from the marker ball. We adjusted our strategies depending on the accuracy of the younger two&#8217;s throws. In the end, Mitchell (the younger of the two) won by a mere point. Kersten, despite losing, was not upset.<br />
When the party finally ended, it took those of us remaining only a short period of time to clean everything up. As we retreated to the Collins Family Estate, Vicki (one of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters) announced a barbeque at Rathtrevor Beach the following day.<br />
Rathtrevor Beach is the Bay of Fundy of the west coast &#8230; only horizontal. Whereas the Bay of Fundy has very high tides, Rathtrevor Beach has very long tides. If you arrive at the beach at low tide, you&#8217;ll find yourself walking well over a kilometre to find water &#8230; even further to find water deep enough to come up to your neck (assuming you stand 5&#8242; 11 7/8&#8243;).<br />
At any rate, the beach is huge. Gigantic. Enormous. And despite the number of people who show up, virtually empty. This leads to things such as sandcastles, kite-flying, and lots of people walking aimlessly. In short, typical beach-going behaviour.<br />
Upon arriving at the beach, we had to take Kersten and Mitchell out onto the beach &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t wait. Mind you, neither could I. The last time I was on an ocean beach (or a saltwater beach, depending on how you look at it) for the purposes of sitting in the sun and doing beach-related things was in 1991. (Yes, I know I went to the beach in Monterey last year, but it was way too cold to even consider swimming.) It had been a long time since I had walked across a good beach.<br />
And boy, do you every have a long walk. Because the beach is so expansive, it also has a lot of interesting features, most notably tidal pools. Although devoid of fish, the pools have lots of shellfish, crabs, and snails. You can imagine the kids&#8217; reaction to those. Most revolved around &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;ewwww!&#8221;. Allison, Robin (another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters), and Wilma (yet another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters, who lives in Germany) gave out marine biology lessons to those of us not quite up-to-snuff with the proper information. While I&#8217;m at, I&#8217;ll mention Mrs. Collins&#8217; last unmentioned sibling, Laura &#8212; Kersten and Mitchell are her children.<br />
What do you associate sand dollars with? Tropical waters, right? Take a wild guess what thrives all over Rathtrevor Beach? Yep &#8230; thousands of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re everywhere. You can&#8217;t take any of them with you &#8212; that&#8217;s a no-no. But you can pick them up and see what they look like while they&#8217;re still alive. Black ones are living &#8230; the whitish ones have since deceased.<br />
Finally reaching the ocean, we waded in a little ways and splashed around a bit. Baby flatfish (halibut or flounders, probably) skitted about our feet, trying to get away from the two-footed giants traipsing through the middle of their sanctuary.<br />
A few minutes later, we realised that the water was about to soak all the things we&#8217;d left on shore to stay dry. The tide was turning, and beginning to reclaim the shore. It was time to go back for lunch.<br />
After partaking in much the same food as we&#8217;d had the day before, several of us ventured back out onto the beach to build a sandcastle. Initially just Brenna, Kersten, and Mitchell, I soon followed, with several others not far behind. The construction was hasty, mostly because the tide was coming in fairly quickly.<br />
As Brenna build the castle with Kersten and Mitchell, I quickly built an outer wall, designed to keep the water away for a short period of time. The wall wouldn&#8217;t hold the water out indefinitely, but it would at least make for a more interesting destruction of the castle.<br />
Sure enough, the water soon arrived, so Kersten and Mitchell took refuge in their sandy kingdom &#8230; for a few precious minutes. Eventually, the tide ate away at the walls, no thanks to the surrounding adults who were surreptitiously splashing the walls, hastening their demise. The flood inside the walls soon took down the castle&#8217;s structure, ending the brief reign of King Mitchell and Queen Kersten.<br />
Following a short swim in the now-flooded beach, we packed up and headed home. Although we could have made the 19:00 ferry to Vancouver, Allison and I waited until the 21:00. In retrospect, this was a good idea &#8230; we would have travelled on a Fast Ferry, and we all know what I think of them.</p>
