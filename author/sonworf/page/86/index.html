	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like realizing that your garden sucks.<br />
When I bought the house, I couldn&#8217;t really see the backyard gardens &#8212; there was quite a lot of snow. That obscured pretty much everything worth seeing and worth hiding. So naturally, when summer rolled around, I was surprised by the plethora of vegetation that was growing from them.<br />
Sadly, mostly weeds. Pretty-looking weeds, in some cases, but still weeds.<br />
I woke up Sunday morning with a bolt of inspiration and purpose: I would landscape my backyard. Well, okay, maybe not something *quite* that drastic. I was at the very least going to clean up the two weed beds and make something of them. I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what that was going to entail, but I did know at the very least, they were going to look much better. The Wasteland of Weeds was about to come to an end.<br />
For Christmas last year, Mom had given me some money to hire a landscaping consultant to come in and do something with my rather large mess. (This was Mom&#8217;s way of suggesting that my gardens sucked. Not that I&#8217;m arguing that at all.) Due to other things getting in my way earlier in the year (dating Alex comes immediately to mind), I never got around to it. I figured that at the very least, I could put the money to use and do the landscaping myself.<br />
Scooting up to the Rona near Sunridge Mall in the Northeast, I went in search of a helpful Rona employee. (Yes, I could have gone to Home Depot as well, but I have a healthy dislike of talking with teenagers who think baby&#8217;s breath is something that comes from eating too much pabulum.) Luckily, I found Sandra, whom I would describe as a hard-core Calgary gardener.<br />
Yes, I was looking specifically for a Calgary gardener. Why? Because this city has some really bizarre weather, hard water, and soil conditions that challenge even the best of gardening experts. I needed someone who knew what they were doing. &#8216;Cuz I don&#8217;t. Most of my family has a green thumb. Mine&#8217;s black.<br />
I gave Sandra the basic view of what I wanted: something low-maintenance (I don&#8217;t want to be planting new flowers every year) that would take to my sometimes shady / sometimes sunny (depending on time of year and angle of the sun) backyard. Giving her the approximate sizes of the two gardens, we went off looking at what Rona had to offer. Being &#8220;late in the season&#8221; (I assume that means planting), there wasn&#8217;t a massive selection. But more than enough for my meagre needs.<br />
So began my horticultural buying spree. Plants of several varieties (hostas, junipers, lilies, baby&#8217;s breath, asters, small shrubs, echinaceas (not the kind for colds), yews, and a couple of things I can&#8217;t remember), three bags of landscaping soil, 150 feet of landscaping fabric, and a hand shovel.<br />
(Here&#8217;s a tip about the landscaping soil: Rona has an unwritten rule that if the bag is torn, they&#8217;ll give it to you for $1. But there&#8217;s a catch &#8212; you need a staff member to tell the cashier that the bag was torn, so it&#8217;s only $1. Otherwise, they&#8217;d have *everyone* tearing the bags open. Sandra was quite helpful in pointing that out.)<br />
Add onto that a set of outdoor lights to add some accent lighting to the longer garden, and I had a plan in motion. I had planned on getting some solar lights, so I wouldn&#8217;t have the additional cost of running cords, dealing with electric set ups, and the benefit of a photovoltaic cell for turning on and off. But Sandra and the electrical expert both warned me away from them. Apparently, they&#8217;re quite dim (the lights, not the staff members) and unless you&#8217;re in direct sunlight, won&#8217;t necessarily charge enough for use.<br />
Then there&#8217;s the cost. One solar lamp: $28. A 10-lamp kit (with transformer, wires, etc.): $25. You do the math.<br />
I managed to cram the whole lot into the Mini. (For those of you who think it&#8217;s not a big car, I offer this as evidence.) Dumping the load into my backyard, I set out to the task of cleaning things up.<br />
About an hour and a half later, two large piles of ex-weeds, two piles of shoots from the two trees in my backyard, and a pile of branches from the lilac bush (I need to really trim that sucker even more), I had brought the yard at least into a state where I could begin the landscaping work.<br />
Well, as soon as I assembled the lights. That took another half an hour.<br />
Step 1: Lay out the lights so you can snake out the 50 feet of low-voltage cord. Surprisingly enough, it was just the right length.<br />
Step 2: Roll out the landscaping fabric, being careful not to crush the two existing hostas and small red shrub (I have no idea what it is). Cut to length. Cut slits so the existing plants come through the sheet.<br />
Step 3: Layout the new plants so they have suitable spacing, have a good aesthetic arrangement, and are ordered by size (small in front, large in back).<br />
Step 4: Go get a beer.<br />
Step 5: With each plant, cut a triangular slit in the fabric where you want to put the particular foliage. Dug out a hole twice the size and 1.5 times as deep. Partially refill with landscape soil. Place unpotted plant into the hole, and fill the remaining space with landscape soil.<br />
Step 6: Repeat Step 5 until out of plants, or back gives out, whichever comes first. Grab another beer somewhere in the middle of all that.<br />
It didn&#8217;t help that it was over 30 degrees, even in the shade. To say that I was hot is putting it mildly. After six hours (from the time I got back home), I hadn&#8217;t even finished the one long garden. It was about then that I realized that Alex hadn&#8217;t come over (she had to work on Sunday) or had called. I figured it was time for a break.<br />
We would meet a little later at the Prince&#8217;s Island Park footbridge (over the Bow River), and walk over to Eau Claire Market for a little air hockey rematch. We haven&#8217;t had an air hockey game in a VERY long time (it was something we did almost religiously when we first started dating). I could say my performance was due to exhaustion, tight muscles, lack of proper food, but the simple fact is that Alex was better. We&#8217;ll just have to do another rematch at a later date.<br />
Returning home, I got back to tackling the smaller garden (I&#8217;d finished the large one before meeting up with Alex). That one required less work insofar as planting is concerned, but I had to move a lot of dirt around, as the bed was a little too low for my liking. Luckily, I had to dig out a lot of dirt to get the rest of the plants in place.<br />
Sadly, I would not finish in one shot, my efforts being thwarted by darkness and the onslaught of mosquitoes. (The ones out here are quite small, almost negligible, but they are now carrying West Nile Virus, and it&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m too keen on catching.) The remaining few plants will have to wait a couple of more days yet.<br />
Now if I can just figure out what to do with all those branches&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, Alex and I went camping. It was the first time I&#8217;d gone camping since about 1997, before I&#8217;d moved to Vancouver. Seven years is far too long a dry period.<br />
We weren&#8217;t camping alone, though. My aunt and uncle had invited us. This meant a good campsite (because Brenda would get up there long before us), good food (my family always cooks well, no matter where it is), and some really good insider knowledge of the Kananaskis area.<br />
Still, one had to be prepared. That meant going to Mountain Equipment Co-op for seam sealer (my tent had leaked the last time I&#8217;d used it) and two self-inflating mattresses so we wouldn&#8217;t be sleeping directly on the compacted gravel ground. (I still think I&#8217;m young, but even in my prime I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to sleep on that ground &#8212; it was like concrete.)<br />
Friday night, I picked up Alex and we headed west, stopping at the Safeway to get our basic food supplies. As we arrived at the store, we could see very dark, ominous clouds heading east. There was a storm approaching. A big one. A nasty one. One that was generating a lot of worry for a lot of people. Alex told me that a tornado watch was in effect.<br />
As we drove west, we started to pass under the storm. Big, heavy drops of rain fell periodically on the windshield. Not the little drops of a starting storm, but the elephantine plops of something wicked this way coming. Alex asked:<br />
&#8220;Um, just out of curiousity, how do you tell when a tornado is going to strike?&#8221;<br />
I thought about all the documentaries and articles that I&#8217;ve read about tornadoes. The general aspect was pretty simple:<br />
&#8220;When you see the worst weather you&#8217;ll ever see in your life.&#8221;<br />
We continued driving, the Mini skating a bit around on the highway. (It was quite windy.) The rain fell harder, the drops barely diminishing in size. Suddenly, going back to Calgary was seeming a better idea.<br />
Plink.<br />
Pling plack plink.<br />
[Insert sound of a million ball bearings bouncing of a tin roof.]<br />
Calgary is conveniently wedged in an area loosely known as &#8220;Hail Alley&#8221;, and for good reason. There&#8217;ve been a few nasty hailstorms here in the last decade or so. This was yet another one.<br />
Like every vehicle on the road, we pulled over. (If I&#8217;d been smart, I would have pulled alongside a transport truck, to shield myself from the deluge.) For the next 10 minutes, we were target practice for Mother Nature. The storm was wild, winds buffeting the little car (and its two occupants), pellets of ice rapping into the side as if to tear it apart (I honestly worried that we&#8217;d lose a window) and creating a 5-6 inch sheet of ice and water on the highway. It was so thick that we couldn&#8217;t see 10 metres away.<br />
The hail ranged from little pellets right up to near golf-ball size. The noise was deafening.<br />
Finally, the storm passed over (thankfully, storms out here don&#8217;t last too long), and we were able to start moving forward. It took a couple of kilometres driving barely over 20 km/h before the road cleared up enough for some forward movement. By the time we got to Scott Lake Hill, it was hard to tell that it had hailed. By the time we got on the highway into Kananaskis, you couldn&#8217;t even tell that foul weather had passed by.<br />
As the storm shrank in the distance (before pummelling south Calgary), Alex noted:<br />
&#8220;That was the worst weather I&#8217;d ever seen in my life.&#8221;<br />
(The result, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was hundreds of little dents on the roof, hood, and passenger side of the car, and a cracked driver&#8217;s side mirror. I&#8217;m taking this up with State Farm for repairs.)<br />
We finally arrived at site 17 of the Peter Lougheed Provincial Park&#8217;s Interlake campground just after 21:00. They were more than a little relieved to see us, since the campground manager had told them there was a tornado warning earlier in the day. (We would have no foul weather for the remainder of our time there.)<br />
We quickly pitched the tent and got ourselves settled. The managers (who zipped up and down on a golf cart) soon spotted the tent and let us know that we had to pay for the time we were there. By that point, we&#8217;d already been to the lake, started a fire, and chatted with Brenda and Jen about the drive out to the campground. (The managers were almost horrified at the story.)<br />
Brenda and Jen took off for the showers (the nearest ones are over a five minute drive away) while Alex and I enjoyed the setting sun and the lightning from distant storms illuminating the horizon over the mountains. We tried to roast marshmallows, but realized that we&#8217;d have to wait until they got back with the car. (The marshmallows were in the rear.)<br />
The two of us stayed up late, sitting on rocks on the shore of Lower Lake, watching the stars (we saw two satellites &#8212; the moving glint is hard to miss), and the massive thunderstorm way off to the south, which flashed light even through the trees (though you couldn&#8217;t hear a single rumble of thunder).<br />
We woke up late(ish) Friday morning. It looked earlier than it was, but since we were nestled well within the trees, it was hard to tell just how early (or late) it was. Almost as soon as we had waken, Alex turned to me, smiled, and said:<br />
&#8220;Happy birthday!&#8221;<br />
She would say this to me all day long. Have I mentioned that I love this woman?<br />
On Thursday, I&#8217;d had a little rant about how after waiting for four years for Critical Mass to finally have a Stampede breakfast, they decided to have one on the day I&#8217;d chosen to go camping. (It figured.) When Brenda offered pancakes as an option, I couldn&#8217;t resist. Alex whipped up the batter, and I tackled the bacon.<br />
So on my birthday, I still had my pancake breakfast. &#8216;Course, watch Critical Mass not do a Stampede breakfast next year.<br />
Following breakfast, Jen, Alex, and I went for a bike ride to fetch some milk. Jen, as you might recall, needs milk as badly as cars need gasoline (see [[Turning Japanese Again, Touring Osaka]]). Skim milk just wasn&#8217;t cutting it, so we biked to the store (near the showers) to pick up four litres of 2%. It would at least tide Jen over until later in the day. (Okay, yes, a bit of an exaggeration. But only a bit.)<br />
The ride there was a bit difficult, but not too hard. The trip back was considerably more difficult, as the hills were steeper. We arrived back to find a rope tied between two trees, brandishing a series of white balloons. The word had been spilled. Someone knew it was my birthday.<br />
(I have to admit that for quite a while, I thought Alex had something to do with all of this. She routinely denied anything beyond her own personal involvement, so I can only assume that my mom must&#8217;ve let her sister in on the deal.)<br />
The bike back had gotten us quite warm. (It didn&#8217;t help that it was already in the high 20s.) This seemed like as good a time as any to go swimming. And since our campsite was next to the &#8220;beach&#8221; (a very rocky beach), it seemed like a good idea. So armed with a couple of chairs and our books, we went in search of something a little cooler.<br />
Lower Lake is &#8230; cold. I won&#8217;t mince words, it&#8217;s numbing. It&#8217;s about 10 degree (an estimate, as I have no thermometer). Walking in was hard enough. Dunking was painful. By the time we got out, we could barely feel our knees. (We had to wear our flip-flops into the lake, due to the sharp rocks on the bottom.) Jen had even more trouble that we did.<br />
Sitting on the beach, we took in the sun, watching the people pass us by and the birds fly overhead. Using a pair of binoculars, I scanned the slopes of Mt. Indefatigable for signs of an illusive bear and her two cubs. They&#8217;re responsible for the mountain&#8217;s trails having been closed for the second year in a row. It&#8217;s not a good idea to climb a mountain with a mother grizzly bear.<br />
The search only garnered me a sunburn on my upper back. Ouch.<br />
Uncle Mike showed up not too long afterwards, with Maggie in tow. That meant it was time for lunch. We went with the old camping favourites: hamburgers and hotdogs. And some potato salad thrown in for good measure.<br />
After lunch, Mike and I hung the hammock. At that point, we officially lost Alex for the rest of the afternoon, as she wanted to spent the rest of her time swinging between the trees. I joined her before too long, and we drifted in and out of consciousness most of the afternoon. (We were supposed to go to Kananaskis Village with Mike and Jen, but they opted not to disturb us.)<br />
Dinner was later than usual, but given the late lunch and the heat, a break from eating wasn&#8217;t such a bad thing. Given the option of a side of beef and chicken, we went with the chicken. It was chicken served with a salad that had avocado and mango thrown in with the raspberry vinaigrette. Quite tasty, really.<br />
We also had dessert, which I&#8217;d half-hoped they wouldn&#8217;t do. (Of course, I half-hoped they would, so I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.) Out came Jen, carrying a birthday cake, riddled with candles. (I hopefully need not mention all the &#8220;old&#8221; jokes I got as we sat around the table. Don&#8217;t worry, Alex, you&#8217;ll get yours in due time.)<br />
Cheesecake. Sadly, not something I can usually eat. In fact, I&#8217;ve only ever been able to eat one cheesecake (one my friend Emma had made during the CBC 50th Anniversary Train journey). Fortunately, Mike and Jen had brought back some chocolate delicacies that would keep me placated.<br />
Following our meal, Alex and went for a short walk (primarily to the toilets, but we looped back via the beach). As we walked away from the campsite, we reached out to hold hands. But there was something in her palm. As I pulled my hand away to see what it was, she deposited the object into my palm. Keys. To her apartment. I think my heart actually stopped for a moment.<br />
Yes, folks, it&#8217;s that serious.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay up too late that night, as it was quite a bit cooler than the night before. Which is too bad, otherwise we might have heard more of the coyotes, who howled around the lakes all night.<br />
Waking around 10:00, we took immediately to the task of collapsing the tent. So long as the tent was down before 11:00, we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about being charged for one more night. Breakfast soon followed &#8212; bacon and eggs, a classic if there ever was one.<br />
Following our meal, we headed up to Upper Lake, for a short hike to Rossland Creek. Or at least that was the idea. Unfortunately, Alex had a blister under her little toe, which subsequently burst, making walking exceptionally difficult. We made it about a kilometre or so, arriving at a large waterfall, before deciding to turn back.<br />
The idea was to head back towards Calgary, stopping at Calaway Park for the majority of the afternoon. Before leaving, we hit the showers at the Boulton campsite, to remove two day&#8217;s grime. Timed or not, that shower felt good.<br />
Arriving at Calaway Park about 90 minutes later, it was 32 degrees. It was stifling. But not nearly as stifling as the $23.54 entrance fee. Having neither enough money (or inclination), we decided that a Slurpee and Bowness Park was more than good enough. The remainder of the afternoon was spent in my backyard, where we read, drank a couple of beers, and cooked the last of our camping food &#8212; two hotdogs, and cobs of corn.<br />
So ended our camping weekend away. It&#8217;s a forgone conclusion that we will be doing this again. It&#8217;s just a matter of when and where.<br />
And preferably without the hail.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Calgary Stampede is up and running again. The kick-off was on Friday, with the much-anticipated Stampede parade. Naturally following the parade is another much-anticipated event in Calgary&#8230;<br />
The Stampede Breakfast.<br />
This has got to be one of the weirdest phenomenons I&#8217;ve ever experienced. Malls, business, even small communities all over the city sponsor free (or exceptionally inexpensive) pancake and sausage breakfasts. All you really need to do is show up and partake. Of course, that can also be part of the problem.<br />
Alex had wanted to try go to Westbrook Mall, not far from where she grew up. She had fond memories of the Stampede breakfasts there. Sadly, there was none to be found, so we were left with trying to get to Chinook before their breakfast was over. The route to get there was a little circuitous, which is not itself a problem, but it did take a little longer. Such as it is, though, we found a breakfast (apparently free, from what we could tell) in Garrison Woods. But we continued to Chinook nonetheless.<br />
The breakfast takes place in the south-east parking lot. And I mean the whole thing &#8212; from the road at the main entrance all the way down past the Chapters. It&#8217;s big. It&#8217;s huge. It&#8217;s actually listed in the Guiness Book of World Records as being the largest outdoor cooked breakfast. It&#8217;s a sea of people, with a flotilla of pancakes followed by a armada of sausages. And best of all &#8212; it&#8217;s free. In it&#8217;s 44th year, it still attracts droves of people.<br />
Food is sponsored by the stores of Chinook Mall, and its employees staff the grills. Alex and I got in the Sears line, which we would soon find out was either the fast cooking line, or the really lazy line because when we finally got to the food (after waiting about half an hour), there were no sausages to be found. And we could get anything from the other lines. There is a temptation to complain about this, but how can you when you didn&#8217;t pay for the meal in the first place?<br />
Sadly, the pancakes weren&#8217;t exactly outstanding, and the coffee seemed only fit for those with no taste (Alex would abandon hers to the ground, only to accidentally splash her feet with the concoction). We would supplement our meal with smoothies from Jugo Juice inside the mall, shortly before going on an underwear-buying spree.<br />
Yes, underwear. I needed some. So sue me.<br />
Realizing that we were officially running a little later than planned, we headed out to Bowness Park way out in the northwest, to attend a barbecue. This was the first annual Topmade Dragon Boat Club barbecue. The Topmade club has several teams, one of which is the DI-Hard team. (The &#8220;DI&#8221;, incidentally, means &#8220;Diagnostic Imaging&#8221;. Most of the people on the team, save for a few, work at Foothills Hospital as technicians. Those of us not working there are significant others.) The Topmade club is large, having about 130 members.<br />
Not all of them came out, unfortunately, but it was still interesting to see all the people that were on the other teams. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to mingle, though. We were there long enough to eat a couple hamburgers (more free food), listen to a speech, talk to a couple of people, and then we had to run off again.<br />
Yes, we were busy people on Saturday.<br />
This time, it was back to our respective homes for a change into clothes more suitable for a show and a dinner afterwards. The dinner? South African. The show? Cirque du Soleil&#8217;s &#8220;Quidam&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;ve seen Cirque du Soleil several times over the years, even from back in the day when they were just getting started. Today, they&#8217;re one of the most recognizable entertainment brands in the world. The last time I saw Cirque du Soleil was for Mystére in Las Vegas (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]). It was an amazing show to see, and I knew that Quidam wouldn&#8217;t disappoint.<br />
Cirque du Soleil requires a fair bit of space to set up all their equipment, and a tent of sufficient size for their stage and bleechers for the audience. The only space in Calgary good enough for this is the old Currie Barracks, currently being used for office space (as the Canadian Armed Forces no longer use the facility). This was where they set themselves up last year, too.<br />
We arrived running a little late, but managed to not miss anything with the show. We found our seats just in time for the ringmaster, John (one of the characters in Quidam) to start the show. The lights dimmed, to the point where you could not see your hand in front of your face. Despite being in a tent, the blockage of light was absolute.<br />
The show started with a bang, quite literally, as one character walked out into the middle of the round stage, and whacked his hands (wearing boxing gloves) over his head. The sharp crack and deep roll of thunder was accompanied by bursts of light high up in the canopy, and more darkness. And so began a little girl&#8217;s adventure from her boring life into the world of Quidam.<br />
That&#8217;s the general premise of the show &#8212; the girl&#8217;s adventure through a strange fantasy world. I don&#8217;t know how on Earth Cirque du Soleil comes up with their themes for the shows &#8212; but I&#8217;m glad they do. It&#8217;s a refreshing way of seeing entertainment in ways that many of us have seen before.<br />
The first act was the German Wheel. You&#8217;ve seen this before &#8212; a metal wheel, about seven feet in diameter, in which sits a sole performer who twists and turns not only himself, but the wheel&#8217;s motion. He was extremely adept with it, bringing the wheel almost to resting on the ground, only to push it back up (rolling around in circles) without ever touching the ground with his body. That kind of muscle control is exceptionally impressive. The fact that he did several acrobatic moves that I&#8217;ve never seen on a German Wheel before was also quite impressive.<br />
Next up were four little (assumedly) Chinese girls, who couldn&#8217;t have been more than 10 years old each. They displayed their talents with the diabolos &#8212; wooden spools slung on strings tied between sticks held in either hand. The strings are run back and forth to make the diabolo spin rapidly, allowing them to do a wide variety of tricks, usually involving throwing the diabolos high into the air. But there was also some rather impressive juggling, with rarely a beat missed.<br />
I say &#8220;rarely&#8221; because of one mistake. One of the girls stands still and flings her diabolo in the air. Another runs up, jumps up onto the shoulders of the first girl, and catches the diabolo on her string. The first time, she missed. But on the second attempt, she caught it. A rather impressive trick, in my opinion (and another reason why there is a live band &#8212; a pre-recorded soundtrack would not have allowed for a second attempt).<br />
Intermixed with the various performances were the ubiquitous clowns, who were quite good at making people laugh. They&#8217;re mimes, mostly, and do not look like the stereotypical circus clown. The first clown act drew a young woman out of the audience, who had to act along with the clown (they were all male) on the act of a first date. The poor woman did an excellent job playing along, despite the obvious embarrassment potential.<br />
The first half of the show continued with some interesting performances, including the Cloud Swing, Aerial Contortion in Silk (a woman hanging on a long sheet of silk), Aerial Hoops, and Spanish Webs. Intermission sent us out in search of some fresh air.<br />
That turned out to be not such a good idea, since our eyes had adjusted to the inside, and the sun had come out since we&#8217;d arrived. For me, it was blinding. I could barely see. For Alex, it was migraine-inducing. We didn&#8217;t spend much time outside before we went back in to take our seats.<br />
It was the right decision, since we were able to find Alex&#8217;s friends, Mandy and Oliver. We&#8217;d known they were coming to the show, but couldn&#8217;t find them in the melee during the break. Their seats were three rows away from ours, and we saw them when they came back. As we were meeting up for dinner afterwards, it was a good thing that we&#8217;d found them ahead of time.<br />
The show resumed with aplomb, subjecting us to the wonders of the Statue (a man and a woman who moved around each other in powerfully slow motions &#8212; they were so strong that he supported her upside down, her shoulders resting on his, and able to slowly stand and kneel without her falling off), the Banquine (acrobats who could do the most amazing stunts without the use of a trampoline or safety wires), and Skipping Ropes (boring-sounding, I know, but you&#8217;ve never seen a pentagonal jumping rope before, I&#8217;ll bet).<br />
The show ended with three curtain calls. The cast was about 40 people or so, but that&#8217;s a guess since I wasn&#8217;t able to count them all. That includes musicians, by the way. The lights came on, and we headed out to try and not be blinded outdoors.<br />
We headed down to 17th Ave., where we met up with Mandy and Oliver at Jabulani, a South African restaurant. (Mandy and Oliver are South African, hence the reason we went.) It&#8217;s been around for a year, and seems to have some sort of regular customers (Mandy and Oliver were recognized by the staff).<br />
The cuisine of South Africa, not completely represented at Jabulani, isn&#8217;t much different than what you&#8217;d find at some of the Western restaurants in Calgary. But it&#8217;s closer to authentic South African. You&#8217;ll find the obvious Dutch and British influences, but also Indian (which I found a bit of a surprise). For example, I had oxtail stew, Oliver had curried lamb, and Alex had &#8220;pork chops&#8221; (they were more like slabs of ham). I can&#8217;t remember what Mandy had.<br />
The meals were excellent. We had South African (soda) pop to go along with our repast. I had Schweppes Dry Lemon, which is basically tonic water with lemon in it. (I was parched from the dry air in the tent, so drank my first Dry Lemon quite rapidly.) Many and Oliver had Grapetisers, which is more or less carbonated grape juice.<br />
Dessert was an experience, indeed. I had something called &#8220;koeksisters&#8221;, which are braided dough, sort of like a tough donut, which you dip into slightly-sweetened whipping cream. The dough is soaked in syrup, so it quite tasty (but not sticky). Mandy had banana samosas. Alex went with roiboos ice cream.<br />
We stayed until almost 22:00, when we finally headed off in our separate directions. But Alex and I didn&#8217;t go home just yet &#8212; we went to check out the fireworks display at the Stampede from Scotchman&#8217;s Bluff, which overlooks the Stampede grounds. It&#8217;s a popular location &#8212; the hillside was already well covered with watchers by the time we arrived.<br />
Bed didn&#8217;t arrived until after midnight. &#8220;Exhausted&#8221; doesn&#8217;t quite cut the feeling of drained. But it was a good exhausted, as it had been a great day. I felt sorry for Alex, who had to work the following morning. I almost feel guilty because I got to sleep in.<br />
Almost&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Saturday started with the *hope* of going out to Elbow Falls to try and do some hiking. Notice that I used the word &#8220;hope&#8221;. Hope turned to not, with the realization that the weather wasn&#8217;t likely to cooperate with us.<br />
We slept in a bit.<br />
After packing in some breakfast, Alex and I went out to do something fun. Specifically, mini-golf at the Golf Centre at Harvest Hills. This appears to be a relatively new construction, or at least the mini-golf course is &#8212; the driving range might have been there a while already (I honestly can&#8217;t remember).<br />
The course is a little more playful than most, but lacks some of the really wacky aspects that some mini-golf courses have. (I say &#8220;lacks&#8221; because, in all honestly, the really bizarre courses are often the most fun.) The course was still damp from previous rainfalls, which provided a few interesting obstacles &#8212; namely, wet feet and a bit of slopping when the balls hit a wet patch.<br />
Most of the holes weren&#8217;t a particular challenge, but that didn&#8217;t stop either of us from hitting some bad shots. We redid two holes, partly because the holes were fun and partly to improve our abysmal scores. (There was also no-one behind us.) In the end, Alex beat me, although I&#8217;m not sure by how much. We kept score, but not really&#8230;<br />
I realized after a couple of holes that Alex could probably whip my keister in mini-golf, if given half the chance. However, a competitive streak in me was coming out &#8212; a bit of a sour one, at that. (I&#8217;m usually self-deprecating, but it&#8217;s a fine line from making fun of your lack of skill, to appearing to be a sore loser.) While she mentioned nothing, and I didn&#8217;t ask if she had noticed and started to play differently as a result, I felt it wise to smarten up a bit.<br />
Putting over, we decided to give the driving a chance. While I had a few really good hits, I was woefully out of practice. I hooked a lot too, seemingly drawn to a parked cherry picker off to the left. I cleared a few over the extra-tall fence. The grips made mince meat of my left palm &#8212; not sure if my grip was off or if its affirmation that I need a glove on that hand. Either way, I need more practice.<br />
The experience on the rather damp mini-golf course made me finally decide that I *had* to get new sandals. (That, and Alex&#8217;s hinting that the smell could be construed as a biological weapon under some treaties.) Lest you think that I&#8217;m being extravagant with my footwear, you need to understand something first&#8230;<br />
I loved my sandals. They were Teva Univerals, purchased from Europe Bound on Front Street in Toronto seven years ago. Seven years I wore them. I wore those sandals as much as I could. When I lived in Vancouver, I had thought about replacing them &#8212; they were getting a little worn (and that was only after about three-ish years). I didn&#8217;t put much effort into it, though, and let it slide &#8230; for over four more years. As of Saturday morning, the insole was reduced to the glue used to hold the insole to the rest of the sandal with the remaining insole cracked and splitting, the velcro barely held, the sole was worn through to the straps and foam rubber insides, and the aforementioned smell was &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just be glad that you can&#8217;t smell things through the Internet.<br />
For the record, I&#8217;ve been actively looking since sandal weather finally hit Calgary this year (took a while longer than usual). Problem: finding sandals that I a) liked, and b) fit. What I wanted was another pair of Teva Universals. Problem? Nary a place in Alberta seems to sell them! I hunted through every store I could find. Nothing. Nada. The closest I came was a pair of the women&#8217;s version at Abominable Sports in Banff (Bamf!). But no men&#8217;s. Anywhere.<br />
It came to pass that we went to Sunridge, where there was rumoured to be leather Tevas. Sadly, I was thwarted yet *again*. However, in the midst of my disappointment, came across a pair of Clarks. Well, my feet haven&#8217;t been so happy. I feel a certain amount of sadness for putting my beloved Tevas to one side, but for the sheer joy of walking in sandals without the squishing, flapping of unbound straps, or the near-unbearable stench, there can be little argument that I&#8217;ve done well.<br />
Just to make sure the sandals were right, we walked around the mall a bit. The walk was good to break in the feet. Even when we stood in the Sanrio store for about 45 minutes while Alex had a serious relapse to her childhood (not that I&#8217;m complaining &#8212; I&#8217;ve had similar problems). It&#8217;s safe to say that should we end up with kids, we will have a Hello Kitty room somewhere in the house.<br />
The big debate will be who gets to spend time in the room &#8212; the children, or mom.<br />
We left the mall into the dark clouds of a passed storm. I had thought I&#8217;d heard rain while we were inside, but it was hard to tell. The wet ground, however, was a bit of a give-away.<br />
A note on that rain, incidentally. There are a lot of people who wonder if we&#8217;ve somehow been transported to the West Coast. The weather here is more typical of Vancouver, not the fringe of the prairies. It&#8217;s quite odd, and annoying for some. We haven&#8217;t had the really warm weather normally associated with this time of year. Instead, we&#8217;ve had rain almost every day (even if just a sprinkle) for a month! We should be entering our dry season, seeing brown grasses, not witnessing torrential downpours every few days.<br />
While Alex went off for tea with her friend Erin, I set about the task of making dinner. It took me longer than planned (owing to a minor issue in preparation), which was just in time for Alex to arrive and start making cupcakes. (We went to my relatives&#8217; home Sunday night, and we were bringing dessert. But more on that in a minute.)<br />
Betty Crocker? Ha! Safeway brand? Puh-leaze! Alex made &#8217;em from scratch. Including the icing! (And darn tasty, too, I might add!) I got to be the official taste-tester. I need to do more baking to get the feel for it. I can handle sauces, entrees, soups, stews, barbecues, even a few desserts. Ask me to bake a cake and I&#8217;ll give you a blank stare. Wouldn&#8217;t even know where to start. Not a one. One day, though. One day.<br />
Sunday we tried to get up early again. The weather, yet again, conspired against us. In lieu of a picnic and hike at Elbow Falls, we opted for a hike at Fish Creek Park and a picnic at Starbucks (or other widely-available similarly-branded store selling things not particularly good for one&#8217;s dietary needs).<br />
Finding the entrance to the section of park we wanted to go into wasn&#8217;t easy. The signs are, well, mostly non-existant. On the bright side, we explored some of the newer subdivisions in the south-west corner of the city. Yet more reasons why I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever want to live that far out. (As Alex so eloquently put it, anything with five digits on the house number is too far away.) It feels like suburban hell out there.<br />
When we finally found the park, we saw signs that bears had also apparently found the park. We never saw any, except on the signs the City of Calgary Parks Department had left up to let park patrons be aware. Considering that we covered a good portion of the park west of MacLeod Trail, it might be safe to assume that the bear(s) prefered to either stay hidden, or leave altogether.<br />
Damp (due to continued precipitation in various strengths and quantities) and hungry, we headed over to South Centre Mall for a quick repast (careful to keep it light for the upcoming family dinner that night). Yogen Fruz. Not the most substantial of snacks, but a load healthier than the bulk of the crap for sale in the food court. We wandered the mall, eating our small frozen vanilla yogurt mixed with fruit, seeing what there was to see.<br />
We stopped in a few stores, but the only one of real consequence was the Charm Diamond Centre, where we looked at rings.<br />
Whoo&#8230; I can see the wide-eyed stares of disbelief and panic from here!<br />
Relax, we&#8217;re not engaged and we&#8217;re not getting married any time soon. We went to look. No other reason (for now) than to view a piece of jewellry. In fact, it was a specific style that Alex had seen before that drew us in there. They didn&#8217;t have it available, though, so I don&#8217;t really know what it looks like (hence, cannot describe it to you). There was an illuminated poster, but the colours were rather washed out.<br />
With that, it was time to head up to Mike and Brenda&#8217;s for dinner. The first meeting of the family is always a bit nerve-wracking, no matter how many times you&#8217;ve done it before or how confident you think you are. Families are always different. My turn will come later this summer.<br />
It was a night of digging. Some digging was about Alex (though not too deeply) and some digs were at each other. Uncle Mike, unfortunately, caught a few too many (some from me, and I went a little too deep on a couple &#8212; sorry, Mike) when the subject of the missing cupboard doors came up. They&#8217;ve been off so long that I don&#8217;t even notice the lack of them anymore.<br />
Dinner was wonderful &#8212; crab cake appetizers, roast beef, freshly roasted BC potatoes, two kinds of salads, and the weirdest bread I&#8217;d ever had. Of course, we had cupcakes for dessert. All the ones we brought were eaten. Three by Jen, alone! (Needless to say, Alex is welcome back.)<br />
So yes, if you&#8217;re wondering, things are going exceptionally well for us. I can&#8217;t imagine them going any better. They will, of course, but I can&#8217;t imagine what that&#8217;ll be like. I haven&#8217;t been this happy in a relationship &#8230; well, ever, really. They say that the person you&#8217;re best with is the person who is like your best friend. And that was exactly the premise that had sent me in search of a partner in the first place.<br />
Funny how life works sometimes, ain&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>Our fair country has been around for 137 years, now, and it doesn&#8217;t look a day over 100 &#8212; we&#8217;ve still got all the problems we did back in &#8217;67.<br />
Alex and I had a fairly action-packed day. We started off with a jaunt over to Booster Juice to get ourselves a snack to get the day started. Why there? Well, a smoothie goes over pretty well right before you do a run.<br />
Yes, run. (If you have missed a few of these, either by living under a rock or scanning them like I know some of you do, I have taken to running for exercise.) This was for the P.A.R.T.Y. program, run through Foothills Hospital. It means &#8220;Prevent Alcohol and Risk Related Trauma in Youth&#8221;. (Yeah, it should be P.A.R.R.T.Y., but then it could be construed to sound like the mating cry of a frat house member.)<br />
Simply put, it&#8217;s a &#8220;scared-straight&#8221; method. Take a bunch of teens, and run them through the trauma bay at the hospital. Show them what&#8217;ll happen if they drink and drive. Show them the injuries, the equipment that would be used, and the procedures they&#8217;d have to go through. Some of them get sick, at least one almost always faints. I don&#8217;t know if it always gets the point across, but I&#8217;m sure that the program must reduce the number of teens injured in DUI accidents.<br />
The race is to raise awareness and money for the program. Fees are $35, which includes the administration of the race, t-shirts, food (though that might be donated), with the rest going to the program. It&#8217;s a 5 km walk/run or a 10 km run, depending on what you want to do. We did the 5 km version. We weren&#8217;t exactly the fastest ones out there.<br />
We were beaten by a one-legged man and a woman carrying two babies.<br />
(Okay, yes, we walked. It was more for helping the program.)<br />
Following the &#8220;race&#8221;, we headed out of town to Banff (Bamf!). The day was starting off to be beautiful, and we hoped it would stay that way long enough for us to enjoy the weather. For the most part, it was great! Right until we passed the 1X interchange near Exshaw. That was when we hit traffic.<br />
Lots of traffic.<br />
About 90 minutes of traffic.<br />
Ninety minutes that would normally take about 10 minutes in regular traffic conditions.<br />
Why was it so bad? They&#8217;re doing bridge reconstruction on the Trans-Canada Highway not far from Deadman&#8217;s Flats. The highway is reduced to two lanes and a speed limit of 50 km/h. Normally, this doesn&#8217;t affect traffic too much. But this is a long weekend (well, it is for some people), which means that most of Calgary goes into the mountains.<br />
Would it *really* have hurt whatever level of government agency that is responsible for this project to put up signs warning of heavy traffic, and suggest alternate routes like the 1A? Y&#8217;know, I&#8217;m thinking that maybe the government might want to think about that for the next long weekend that comes up (or possibly every weekend, now that the weather is outstanding) so people can avoid that kind of traffic. (That would be a subtle hint for any of you government-types listening out there.)<br />
Arriving at the east-end Banff off-ramp, we turned north instead of south, and went to Lake Minnewanka. I&#8217;d only been there once before (see [[Banff National Park and Lake Minnewanka]]), during some very nice weather. Yesterday, sadly, wasn&#8217;t great. Clouds had rolled in as we had started to leave Calgary, and had splashed rain on us at Canmore. We would be rained on several times yet before the day was through, and usually while we were outside, away from the car.<br />
We walked past the boat launch at the south end of Minnewanka, and up to a rocky shoreline. There, we found a place on the &#8220;beach&#8221; to just look around at the beauty of the area. It drizzled a little, not enough to chase us away.<br />
From there, we drove over to Lake Johnson, where we had the chance to wander a bit in the forest. A plethora of mosquitoes eventually chased us back out, and we headed into Banff (Bamf!) townsite.<br />
For the first time since I can&#8217;t remember when, we couldn&#8217;t get a parking spot in the free lot. Yes, I know it was Canada Day, but even the last time (see [[Visiting Bragg Creek and Elbow Falls, Canada Day in Banff (Bamf!)]]), we got parking there. We ended up circling the side streets before finding a nice spot, and headed for a late lunch/early dinner at Bruno&#8217;s Diner.<br />
When we exited, we found that Banff Ave. had effectively been closed down. It was a parade, of all things! I&#8217;d never seen a Canada Day parade before, so it was a bit novel. Even more so that it was in a small town, meaning it was going to be a small one. Still, there was room for the Shiners (a necessity at any parade), a couple of floats (including one for the Calgary Stampede, which starts next Friday), two or three marching bands, a fire truck, a Snocoach from the Columbia Icefields, and the 10th Brigade pipe and drum band.<br />
Parade over, we walked down more side streets until we found our way to the Bow River, where we sat for a while, eating our Turtles fudge. That&#8217;s about when the rain hit again. We took cover under some conifers, waiting for the rain to pass enough that we could walk back to Banff Ave. without getting soaked.<br />
We took the opportunity to into a couple of stores and view wares for sale. Alex bought a rather nice toe ring, and I bought a book called &#8220;Why I Hate Canadians&#8221;, by Will Ferguson. (It&#8217;s a rather interesting book about a Canadian returning home after several years abroad. He goes after the sacred cows and reminds us that while we think we&#8217;re the best thing since sliced bread, we&#8217;re not as special as we think we are.) Alex read it aloud to me as we drove back to Calgary.<br />
And as should be done by every Canadian who can, we went to see fireworks last night. The best show in town is at Canada Olympic Park. We didn&#8217;t opt to go all the way out there, since the traffic back would be simply ridiculous. So we opted to hike up the side of Nose Hill to get a good view. In theory, it was a splendid idea. In reality, well&#8230;<br />
Nose Hill is a great place for a hike. During the day. At night, it&#8217;s difficult to see, so you run risk tripping over large rocks. Also, you have deliriously stupid teenagers who feel the need to shriek like idiots the whole time (I swear I got 40 years older last night), nearly drowning out the faint booms of pyrotechnics exploding several kilometres away.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the mosquitoes. With all the rain we&#8217;ve been having, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em this year.<br />
All in all, it was a wonderful Canada Day. And a busy one. Sadly, I had to come in to work today (not having the foresight to take it off), so was a little out of it for most of the day. Next year, though, I&#8217;m going to enjoy it more, and make a nice, long weekend out of it.<br />
With Alex, of course.<br />

		<p>This weekend was a bit of a surprise. Not that it suddenly appeared from out of nowhere, but that until something happened, I had no idea what was yet to come.<br />
The weekend started with the one thing I did have control over: a barbecue. Specifically, the first Jerks BBQ of the summer. What is a &#8220;Jerks BBQ&#8221;, you might ask? The group of people that I work with most around the office are The Jerks. Effectively, we&#8217;re mostly web developers. Why &#8220;Jerks&#8221;? Well, we have a rather odd term of endearment around here: &#8220;JERK!&#8221;. Hence, we&#8217;re Jerks.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s 23:00 Sunday night, and this is the first time in four days that I&#8217;ve had a chance to be alone with my computer.<br />
Not that I&#8217;m necessarily complaining, I might add.<br />
The last four days have been a mad combination of work-related mayhem, drunken debauchery (see: work-related mayhem), and spending time with Alex. All of it has been great fun, which is why I need two entries to cover it all. But first, the work-related mayhem and drunken debauchery &#8230; more or less in that order.<br />
Every six months, Critical Mass holds a Town Hall. It&#8217;s a gathering of everyone in the company, remote offices included, to listen to information the company wishes to disseminate in a semi-public forum. The Town Halls held in January are mostly business. Numbers, facts, trends&#8230; you usually need several strong coffees to get you through them. But the ones in June are a special breed &#8212; it&#8217;s more of a show than real information. It&#8217;s almost an excuse to leave the office and watch a bunch of people entertain the rest of us, gain a bit more information than we already did, and then go drinking.<br />
At least, that&#8217;s what this one was like.<br />
We gathered at the Vertigo Theatre, in the basement of the Calgary Tower complex downtown, not far from the office. This apparently used to be an old movie theatre, now converted into fairly nice stage theatres. When we arrived in the lobby, we were split into small groups (for what reason, I wasn&#8217;t initially certain. When our group was called, we walked over to the theatre door, but were thrown up against the wall, and subjected to what I can only describe as a severe infraction of the Geneva Convention. We had to sing The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;Macho Man&#8221;.<br />
This was courtesy of Dan, my business unit&#8217;s Managing Director. He was strung out on something (either far too much caffeine, or something far more exotic), wearing a microphone of a style made famous by Garth Brooks, and yelling like he was on TV. Apparently, so were we. As Phillipe filmed, we were made to cheer, laugh, heckle, and boo. Then came the song. We were quite puzzled, to say the least. It came quite clear when we entered the theatre, only to find the next group after us being subjected to the same humilation &#8212; broadcast onto a large screen on the stage.<br />
Once everyone had been put through the wringer and the auditorium was full, we began the show. Dan walked out on stage, still wearing the mike, announcing that he was the stage manager of this freak show, and it was time to get it going. So with no further adieu, he welcome onstage the announcer, the man with the best radio voice in the company, Scott. Naturally, this precipitated a loud cheer from those of us who work with him. Scott then took over, bringing on the musical host of this wacky production, which was to no-one&#8217;s surprise, our sound engineer, Dewi. And then came the host, the man who puts the &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;loser&#8221; (bit of an in-joke, due to his last name), my *boss*, Allard.<br />
*That* suprised me. No, actually, that *stunned* me. I simply did not see that coming. But the fact that he was hosting the little deal was nothing compared with the fact that he was not only good at what he did, he was *amazing*. As I would find out later, almost none of Allard&#8217;s material was scripted (at least so that he had to remember it). He either only had vague directions leading to some dialogue, or completely adlibbed. His opening monologue was actually very funny. He even caught our CEO, Jerry, completely off-guard by calling him by his initials: JJ &#8230; and JK, JL, JM, J-Lo. (Jerry&#8217;s reactions to Allard&#8217;s off-the-cuff comments were almost as entertaining as the comments.)<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;ve challenged Allard to keep this up for our meetings. He&#8217;ll make them a lot more interesting.<br />
Several videos peppered the skits that the group put on. The group included the five previously mentioned, Thelton, Dave, Carl (who did a great job presenting the true direction of the company), two Peters, Simone, Robb, Chrissie, Ed, Jason, Arif (a mainstay of all our Town Halls), and &#8220;guest appearances&#8221; by Cory, Colin, and the infamous rubber chicken. While the chicken incident kind of bombed (the joke was a little abused as of late), the videos had people rolling in many cases.<br />
The bulk of the actual business information came from the rather lengthy Q&amp;A session with Thelton and Jerry, kicked off by the question that all inquiring minds wanted to know: Boxers or briefs? While Thelton and JZ were hoping to avoid some of the more numbers-related questions, they invariably arose (hard not to, I guess). But they were all answered. And we ended the session early.<br />
Early enough for the aforementioned debauchery.<br />
This year, we ended up at the Whiskey. They weren&#8217;t ready for us when we arrived, and the poor bartender upstairs had to run around frantically to get ready. We got there about an hour ahead of time. But frankly, that&#8217;s not an excuse. The inside of the Whiskey was dead. Can you expect me to believe that they couldn&#8217;t have had the upstairs ready in time? Not swift, if you ask me. But soon enough, we were getting loaded, and that&#8217;s all that really matters.<br />
A water gun made an appearance, weilded by Thelton. (You got to love a President who&#8217;s willing to be as immature as the rest of us.) Adrian tackled him to get it away and hose down others. I got wet on a few occassions, but didn&#8217;t care so long as the camera stayed dry.<br />
Before I knew it, the sun was setting, and a group of us were heading over to the Bear and Kilt to continue festivities. The antics, including spilled beers (on the pool table, so I gather &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t me, incidentally), spilled french fries and beef dip sauce (that was me), and probably more than a few spilled secrets (don&#8217;t know if that was me or not &#8212; I was very drunk by then) flowed about. By after 1:00, it was time to go home.<br />
Mark, Amy, and I wandered down 4th St. to take Amy home. Mark headed off at 17th Ave., with the two of us continuing south. Amy offered to put me up at her place overnight, but I needed to get home for my cameras for the following morning. Despite two stops for hangover prevention, I woke up with a killer headache.<br />
Just in time for the Kananaskis Cowpunch.<br />
&#8220;What on Earth is that?&#8221; you might be asking. This is the name for this year&#8217;s company summer event. Arriving at the office (holding my head and liberally drinking a bottle of Gatorade), we waited for the signal to board our buses and head out to the Rafter 6 Ranch, not far from Exshaw. There, we would engage in activities that would have nothing to do with our daily job. This included golf (nine holes), white water rafting, horseback riding (western-style), yoga, hiking, or canoeing. Me? I chose to do nothing, and take pictures instead.<br />
Why? Well, I don&#8217;t have my own clubs, and I play cross-country golf. (I&#8217;m pretty bad.) I&#8217;ve done white water rafting on the Kicking Horse River three times &#8212; the Kananaskis River just ain&#8217;t gonna cut it. I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of horses, so riding was out. As for yoga, while I do love it, I&#8217;m very partial to my yoga instructor, Lori, and wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for someone different. Hiking didn&#8217;t sound interesting at first, though I found out later that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have minded it. As for canoeing, it was in a 12-person canoe. That&#8217;s a dragonboat to me, which is not really quite what I had in mind for relaxing.<br />
Besides, *someone* needs to take the pictures.<br />
The weather in Calgary and area as of late resembled that of Vancouver &#8212; wet and miserable. Cyndy, our office manager and the one who organized most of this, was unbelievably relieved to see that the weather had panned out. She swore that things weren&#8217;t going to work out. But the sun was out, the weather was warm, and clouds were few and far between. Almost as soon as we arrived at the Ranch (the golfers went direct to the course), the groups went off to get ready.<br />
I wandered down to where the horse riders were gathered to hop on their mounts. The horses were not the happiest animals I&#8217;ve ever seen. They&#8217;re either extremely well-trained, or (and I hate to suggest it) abused. They didn&#8217;t move very much, and didn&#8217;t seem particularly energetic. As I don&#8217;t know horse behaviour that well, I can only assume (and hope) that Rafter 6 Ranch follows proper animal treatment guidelines.<br />
Over at the rafting shed, the majority of the CM group was getting their waivers sorted out (which apparently contained some clause about bears, of all things) and preparing to get their equipment to head out. I really wanted to get photos of the rafters on the water, but as I had no idea where they were setting in (it wasn&#8217;t at the Ranch), I had to settle for some group shots pre-wetsuits.<br />
I passed back and forth between the horse riders (it took a while to get them all on horseback) and the rafters (it took a while to get them all in rubber) until both groups had headed off. Luke, the largest person in the rafting group, looked about the most uncomfortable in his wetsuit. I so desperately wanted a picture of him in his neoprene skin, but he wisely declined.<br />
The horses were mostly watching people who have either never ridden a horse, or looked very uncomfortable on a horse, waiting around for the rest of the group (there would be two waves) to get their horse. Some people were fairly even with their steeds, and aside from a bit of uneasiness, were ready to ride. Some, like Jamie, looked like they&#8217;d never been on a horse before (Jamie actually said: &#8220;How does this thing work?&#8221; &#8212; it was hard to tell if he was serious or not).<br />
Then there was Garth. Garth is our DBA Manager. Garth seemed to really know what he was doing. I even commented on it.<br />
Me: Garth, you sound like an old ranch hand!<br />
Garth: I am.<br />
Figures I&#8217;d meet a DBA Manager who grew up on a farm south of Edmonton, who rode horses for the better part of a decade.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that there weren&#8217;t a couple of problems. Terri&#8217;s horse suddenly decided to not want to cooperate and reared up. Terri, fearing a bucking, grabbed the reins to keep from falling off. Sadly, not the correct course of action, as pulling back on the reins only makes the horse rear more. It took a few quick commands from the handlers to keep Terri from falling off.<br />
Horses off and rafters away, I wandered back up to our portion of the ranch to hang out for the next couple of hours. There, I found Cyndy and Lindsay, who had beers in hand. It appeared the bar was officially open.<br />
And everyone else thought I was missing out on activities&#8230;<br />
We chatted a while, admiring the surrounding area. The Rafter 6 is located in a wonderful little pocket of Kananaskis, within spitting distance of the mountains without actually being in them. And far enough away from the highway that you can&#8217;t hear it. Just the wind, the birds, the odd nickering of a horse, wind through the trees, and the river (once you get close enough to it, anyway).<br />
The Ranch is about 200 years old, so I&#8217;m told. It&#8217;s also massive, though I suspect much of the land has either been turned into random pasture land (instead of the need for huge expanses for cattle) with some turned over to other interests (there&#8217;s a YMCA camp &#8220;next door&#8221;, which I imagine was once part of the ranch itself). But there&#8217;s still ample room to wander around. The grounds have several buildings, including the hotel, dining hall, barn, several cabins, and the chapel (which was where the yoginis practiced their moves &#8212; quite a beautiful sight from where we were).<br />
Lindsay and I decided to go off on a short walk to find the others in our &#8220;do nothing&#8221; group. We headed down to the river (we understood that Pavel had brought a fishing rod), babbling the whole way there and back. We never found the rest of the group, but did have a nice walk, nonetheless.<br />
Lunch was not far off when we got back, which was about the time that the hikers, horse riders, and rafter returned. Yoga had finished, the participants changed and lounging around. Slowly, but surely, the group was regathering. Cyndy and I went out to meet the horse riders as they trotted through. Cyndy was having far too much fun with everyone else, and commented that they&#8217;d all be walking bow-legged for a while. Someone commented about needing a rub-down &#8230; then Harjinder commented about needing some Vaseline. I nearly dropped the camera from laughing so hard.<br />
Lunch was hamburgers, chicken, vegetable shishkebabs, baked beans, and salads. Following what most of us considered to be normal buffet behaviour, we grabbed two hamburger buns and got in line. One burger each. Fine, we&#8217;ll just come back later. Apparently, Rafter 6 had only enough buns so that we&#8217;d have *one* burger each. One. Just one. Uh, hello? It&#8217;s a barbecue. No-one has just *one*. Sliced bread had to come out for everyone else. The golfers finally showed up as the first round of lunch was wrapping up.<br />
After lunch, we had completely unstructure free time. This led Luke, Torin, and myself to go way out into the fields and throw around Luke&#8217;s aerobee (basically, a flying ring, as opposed to the standard Frisbee). My aim was way off for the first little while, and I made Luke and Torin run a bit. I eventually grew tired of the activity, and resumed photography.<br />
I was waiting for the &#8220;surprise&#8221;. At 14:30, we were told to head down to the rodeo corral for the remainder of the afternoon. This was for a rodeo, though not with any animals other than horses. This was a volunteer rodeo, where various members of the staff would hop on a horse and make a horse&#8217;s ass of themselves. Which, of course, is the point.<br />
More food would await us. As I approached the rodeo corral, I saw a large group of people milling around something, then walking off with &#8230; ICE CREAM! Changing my direction, I went in direction of something cold and yummy. I had thought the vessel holding the cool treats was a freezer of some kind. But we were on a ranch &#8212; the ice cream was contained in soft-sided insulated bags, slung over the back of a miniature horse. It was very cute, although the little guy REALLY hated the bags, and didn&#8217;t really appreciate 200 somewhat drunk people surrounding it.<br />
The rodeo was quite simple: a corral, six horses, and a few interesting games. First up was Musical Horses. Similar to musical chairs, the idea is to walk your horse around a ring of tires. When the music stops, you jump down and put one foot in the tire. The rest is pretty self-explanatory. Then there was the egg race, which is a lap around the corral holding an egg on a spoon. Following that was a race where two people (on different horses) had to hold a piece of plastic tape between them. First ones across the finish line still holding the tape between them won. Then came the barrel race, a rodeo mainstay, involving a little more horsemanship to get around all the barrels. A bizarre relay race came afterwards, involving two riders per horse and a few transgender clothing swaps. The final race was the favourite: the beer race. That&#8217;s when six riders run to the other end, chug a beer (you have to turn it upside down over your head to prove you&#8217;ve finished), then race back.<br />
Musical horses was quite funny. Dan got stuck with the smallest horse, which he seemed rather proud about. Dan was quite adept with his little horse, out-maneuvering several others, only to finally be defeated because his horse wanted to grandstand instead of co-operate. The music, incidentally, was the rest of us singing &#8220;100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall&#8221;, which went something like this:<br />
&#8220;100 bottles of beer on the wall, 100 bottles of beer, [incoherent mumbling following the tune of the song], 99 bottles of beer on the wall&#8230;&#8221; and so on.<br />
Partway through the rodeo, I opted to go get another ice cream. It was hot, and they&#8217;re tasty. And that&#8217;s all the excuse I need, darn it! When I got out there, the wee little horsie wasn&#8217;t in much better of a mood than when I&#8217;d first come across him. In fact, as I attempted to get my ice cream bar, the little bugger got out of his bridle, and started to pull away. His handler tried to hang onto him, but only got one of the refrigerator bags off instead. Released of the grip, he was off like a shot, tearing away at a rate you couldn&#8217;t have convinced me a little thing like that could do! He even kept up with the bigger horses. One of the ranch hands took off after him with a lasso. Had my hands not been full, I would have been able to get the whole event on video.<br />
The egg race was a little dull, other than all the fallen eggs, of course. The tape race was only amusing insofar as watching Evelyn and Jamie try to stay on their horses and still hang onto the tape. Jamie&#8217;s prowess with a horse is &#8230; well, nigh non-existant, so he was having difficulties staying with Evelyn. The barrel race was a bit of a heart-stopper when Marcie fell off when her horse came to a dead halt as it prepared to go around the last barrel. Thankfully, she was alright. Moments later, the same thing nearly happened to the next person, but recovered in time. The clothes race was something to watch, if only to see Jerry in a frilly woman&#8217;s bathing suit.<br />
The beer race was the contentious one. It came down to two key competitors: Bill and Chris. On the first race, Bill won but was called out for supposedly not drinking all of his beer (on video replay, there was a bit too much landing on his hat). Chris, reported to be the fasted guzzle in the west, probably felt a bit cheated. So there was a rematch, pitting the two (and Lindsay, who came in third) to resolve the issue. This time, Chris raced to success, with Bill a little more drunk for wear.<br />
The rodeo over, we all headed back to the dining area to relax until the busses were called &#8212; not long afterwards. By this point, I was resembling a lobster (or rather, I was told I was; in reality I wasn&#8217;t nearly that bad), and felt it wise to head out on the first wave of busses. However, I should have waited for the fourth and final bus.<br />
Those who did engaged in what I could only imagine to be the wildest bus party the company has ever seen. Cyndy was so loopy, she was tossing clothing out the window as it went down the road (I have no idea whose it was). Waterguns were soaking everything in sight. Thelton decided to try and sneak up on Shawn, our Account Director in Austin, crawling along the aisle floor on all fours. Shawn, however, saw Thelton coming, crawled over two rows of chairs to empty his beer onto Thelton&#8217;s head. A pit stop at a Petro-Canada set off a round of stickering (mostly on people) and a run on beef jerky. Somewhere along the line, Cyndy declared something about &#8220;getting nekkid&#8221; and swapped shirts with Jim.<br />
*Sigh* I miss all the fun.<br />
We were to head to Coyotes after arriving back at Critical Mass. There we engaged in more games of &#8220;see how many drink tickets we can get from Thelton&#8221;, among babbling with each other. Staying at Coyotes was not an option, however. Coyotes is not really my first choice for a good bar to go to &#8230; actually, it would be my *last* choice, along with Cowboys and Tantra (formerly The Drink). Such as it was, however, the beer was free, and that was reason enough.<br />
Luke, Allison, James, Torin, Scott, Natalia, Wendy, Alain, Gary, and myself vacated (long before the Miss Corona pageant was to start, thankfully) and went to Sumo over in Eau Claire Market. There we gorged ourselves on Japanese (mostly sushi) and swapped stories about the day. As the sun slowly set, a chill came over. About 30 minutes before we left, Torin barked out &#8220;Hey Jerks!&#8221; to someone passing by the patio we were on. It was Jerry, Scott (from Chicago) and Shawn. Jerry whipped around to see who had insulted him. Seeing it was just us, he barked back: &#8220;F*ck you!&#8221; We laughed.<br />
The evening over, I retreated back to my safe little home to recover from the day. Lest you think I was heavily intoxicated at the time &#8212; I was very sober. In fact, I&#8217;d spent the whole day pretty much peachy. Not driveable-peachy, but not even really buzzed. Hangovers tend to make you not want to drink as much the next day, I find. No, the reason I went home was that I was very, very tired.<br />
And after the last two days, I needed the rest.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Alex and I have been seeing each other for a couple of months now, and we felt it secure enough to try something a little adventurous: a weekend away from the city.<br />
Exactly how we found out about it, I&#8217;m not sure (I think Alex had a pamphlet or flyer), but we decided we would go to Banff (Bamf!), specifically to see a jazz concert at the Banff Centre. As an additional bonus, the Banff Centre offered something called &#8220;Jazz Up Your Weekend&#8221;, which is a package including the tickets to the show and a discounted rate for a room in one of the Banff Centre&#8217;s rooms. (They have a sort-of hotel. Not quite a real hotel, but it&#8217;s close enough.)<br />
We discussed other activities to engage in, but the key reason was the concert. So imagine the disappointment when we found out that tickets were all sold out. But the clerk told me that I could call back later in the week, on the off chance that someone would return the tickets. I &#8220;neglected&#8221; to tell Alex that. (Hey, I gotta put some mystery into this relationship.)<br />
Friday finally rolled around and we were off to Banff (Bamf!). After taking a detour through Market Mall to get a bite to eat, hitting the local 7-11 for a Slurpee, and driving out through Cochrane (only because we could). We finally hit Banff (Bamf!) just after 21:00, and found our way to the Banff Centre. Alex figured it out almost as soon as I turned off Banff Ave., though she didn&#8217;t find out about the concert until later.<br />
After checking in, we stopped briefly at the coffee shop on campus for a chai latte (apparently not too bad) and a hot chocolate (which was little more than steamed chocolate milk). I say &#8220;campus&#8221; because that&#8217;s about the best way to describe the place.<br />
The Banff Centre is a large complex of a couple dozen buildings, ranging in size from small huts to multi-wing dormitory/meeting buildings. The Centre itself is devoted to education and advancement of the arts (including music, fine arts, new media, and dance). Within the Canadian jazz community, it&#8217;s apparently the pinnacle of talent and advancement (as we would find out the next night). Situated on the slopes of Tunnel Mountain, it&#8217;s far enough away from the townsite to be isolated, but close enough that you can walk there in about 10 minutes.<br />
We debated on sleeping in the next morning, but decided to give breakfast a try. Our room came with four coupons, good for a &#8220;complimentary breakfast&#8221;. We had no idea what it was, but figured if the Saturday breakfast was no good, we&#8217;d sleep in on Sunday. Figures that it was a full buffet, including Belgian waffles and fresh omelettes.<br />
Our primary target for the day, concert notwithstanding, was the summit of Sulphur Mountain, tackled by foot. We would walk there, which was a few kilometres from the Centre. We started by heading down Tunnel Mountain Road, following the bend of the Bow River. Or at least that was the plan.<br />
Barely 10 steps onto Tunnel Mountain Road, we spotted a trail leading off into the forest. As we weren&#8217;t in a hurry, we opted for a slight little detour. The detour took us considerably out of our way (we didn&#8217;t realize this until later), but we found the north side of the Bow River to be quite a bit more interesting (and quite a lot less travelled) than the south side (which is where you&#8217;ll find the Banff Springs hotel). The view of the Bow Falls from the north side is also a little harrowing, the slope down into the rapids is high, and quite steep.<br />
We arrived at the base of the trail up Sulphur Mountain about an hour and a half after leaving the Centre. We would take a trip through the Sulphur Mountain Gondola base station to get something to drink (you don&#8217;t climb the mountain without liquids) and something to eat (some delicious fudge). Then it was up the hill.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d tackled Sulphur Mountain was almost three years ago (see [[Visiting Bragg Creek and Elbow Falls, Canada Day in Banff (Bamf!)]]) with Stuart and Therese. It was on a nice, warm, sunny day long after all the snow had melted off the mountain. This time, it was cloudy, a bit cool in the upper climbes, and despite the park rangers having said the path was clear, finding numerous banks of snow (naturally, in all the bends in the switchback path, one of which I got stuck in trying to climb over) and large mud patches.<br />
Along the way, we ran into acquaintances. First was Christian, a fellow Critical Masser, up for the day with his girlfriend for a hike up before the Calgary Flames game that night. Then we ran into an ex-student of Alex&#8217;s (as part of her job, Alex has students work with her to train them to be x-ray technicians) about 3/4 of the way up.<br />
The climb was long (the signs say about two hours) and tiring. I was considerably more tired than I thought I should be, but didn&#8217;t know why until we got to the top. Just over 90 minutes. Alex probably would have killed me for that pace, had she the energy to do so. (The pace, incidentally, was not intentional.) After resting a bit at the top, we headed back to the base station.<br />
By gondola.<br />
We hiked back down to the Banff Springs, taking a &#8220;short cut&#8221; through the forest. We bypassed the hotel, and found ourselves in the middle of a large field, to the south of the golf course. Alex tried to romp through it, but the grass was a little rough. That, and there was plenty of elk dung all over the place. You couldn&#8217;t walk anywhere without running into it (either fresh or long-since dried). We laid down a while, in a relatively dung-free area, before heading along the river and back into town.<br />
We ate a very late lunch (or an early dinner, depending on your point of view) at Bruno&#8217;s. One of the best corned beef sandwiches I&#8217;ve had in a long time, and bar none the best sweet potato fries Alex or I have ever had. We recovered from our massive hike, listening to the Flames fans driving up and down Banff Ave., honking their horns. It seemed that even the little resort town was gearing up for Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.<br />
After a bit of shopping in town, we walked back to the Banff Centre and got ready for the concert. (We both needed showers quite badly.) We then headed over to the Margaret Greenham Theatre, and prepared for a night of jazz.<br />
Yes, we went to a concert instead of watching Game 6. That&#8217;s not to say that we were the only ones missing it. Thankfully, the performers were aware of this and tried their best to provide scores as they became aware of them.<br />
The style of jazz was mostly improvisational. Aside from two pieces (&#8220;Pannonica&#8221; and &#8220;Bye-Ya&#8221;, both by Thelonius Monk), the rest were composed either by the Director of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music (Dave Douglas) or by visiting composer and trombonist, George Lewis.<br />
The first set was &#8220;Mountain Passages #1-5&#8221;, written by Douglas, and performed by seven people who came out on stage tied together in mountain climber fashion. This was because the piece (introduced by Douglas) was written to be performed at 10,000 feet elevations. The piece was quite interesting and very intricate. Not at all the kind of jazz I&#8217;d been expecting. It was a prelude of what to expect. Even stranger was the choice of instruments, which included a cello and a banjo.<br />
Upon completion, the group left the stage and a new group came out, approximately 14 people playing two pianos, two cellos (until that point, had never heard of cello in a jazz band), several saxophones, horns, electric guitar, and a double bass. Then Lewis walked out on stage, presumably to take his position as conductor.<br />
I was about to argue against his presence. Why would there need to be a jazz conductor? I&#8217;ve always wondered about the need for a conductor (having never been in a band myself, I should add), since the musicians should know how to play the music. Interestingly, enough, Lewis felt quite the same way, and said as such to the audience, adding: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back when I feel I&#8217;m needed&#8221;. He promptly left the stage, and the band began.<br />
Lewis&#8217;s pieces (&#8220;Smashing Clusters&#8221; and &#8220;Hello/Goodbye&#8221;) are significantly stranger than the jazz music I&#8217;m more familiar with. But from an artistic perspective, it was interesting to watch the performers play such an odd piece of music. I have a great deal of respect for jazz musicians, since they are able to play such eclectic works, and yet still embellish their own style on it (which is more or less expected of them).<br />
A few minutes into the first piece, Lewis came back out on stage, and started directing the band, cutting some people off, encouraging others to play solos, or completely changing the music around. Suddenly, I saw how a conductor (especially the composer) can radically affect the sound. At times, watching Lewis was more entertaining than listening.<br />
The intermission came, and we headed out into the lobby. (The game was tied 2-2, going into overtime.) We shared a ginger ale, to make up for the higher, drier altitude, and for the lack of liquids as a result of all our walking around earlier in the day. About 20 minutes later, the lights blinked, and we headed back in.<br />
As we&#8217;d been informed near the beginning of the show, the performers would be joined by &#8220;Shorty&#8221;, one of George Lewis&#8217;s inventions. Shorty is the combination of a player piano and a software program that runs off a laptop. Three musicians, Dave Douglas (on trumpet), Jason Moran (apparently, a well-known jazz pianist), and Lewis (on trombone) would play with Shorty (for the first time). Shorty is an improvisational piano player, and would adapt to the music played by the other three.<br />
For the record, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of improvisational jazz. I need a melody. Improvisational jazz, to me, is little more than a random series of notes that don&#8217;t really blend together. I don&#8217;t mind improvisation on top of melody, but the melody must exist. Otherwise, it&#8217;s random notes.<br />
That said, watching the three people and one machine play (the piece was titled &#8220;Trip Music for Humans and Non-Humans&#8221;, but I suspect there is no defined score for it) was quite fascinating, especially for someone in the computer field.<br />
Eventually, Shorty was turned off and a dummer and bassist entered the stage, and the five players went into the Monk pieces, and a third by Muhal Richard Abrams, called &#8220;J.G.&#8221;. They blended the pieces so seemlessly that you couldn&#8217;t tell where one piece ended and the next began, if you didn&#8217;t already know the tunes (which I didn&#8217;t). Those last three pieces were the kind of jazz I needed to hear, and it sounded amazing.<br />
Concert over (sadly, with the Flames having lost), Alex and I headed up to the Upper Hot Springs, which are open until 23:00 during the summer season. It was good to climb into the 39-degree water to bake out the stiffness and soreness we could probably expect the following day. We weren&#8217;t the only ones there &#8212; several of the patrons were Japanese tourists, the rest appearing to be locals (including several teenagers).<br />
We stopped at the Mac&#8217;s on the way back, picking up some snack food, so we&#8217;d have something to eat while we shared a bottle of wine back at the hotel.<br />
Breakfast got us out of bed early again, though we had French toast instead of waffles this time. Having no particular plans for the rest of the morning, we took things slowly, eventually heading downtown to do some shopping. I didn&#8217;t end up buying anything (though I was looking around).<br />
Around 14:00, we headed up to the Banff Springs to partake of Afternoon Tea. I&#8217;d always heard it was a great place to go, and really wanted to see what it would be like. Unfortunately, it would be something we&#8217;d have to experience another day. The activity of the day before had caused Alex to experience a bit of a headache, which since waking that morning blew up into a full-blown migraine. The only thing we could do at that point was go home.<br />
Summer has arrived in southern Alberta (finally), which means that this won&#8217;t be the only time Alex and I go to Banff (Bamf!). Hopefully, you&#8217;ll see more entries from that area, replete with additional tales of &#8230; well, stuff.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s just something inherently wrong with watching Stanley Cup hockey while sweating because it&#8217;s so warm. The season needs to be shorter.<br />
Or there need to be fewer teams, especially in places where you can&#8217;t naturally have ice outside. (But that&#8217;s just a personal gripe.)<br />
Last night was Game 5 in the Tampa Bay-Calgary Stanley Cup Final series. As is becoming a habit, Craig organized a gathering at the Rose and Crown, one of Calgary&#8217;s more popular watering holes. A former employee of the Rose, Craig was able to secure spaces on the third floor for us, so we&#8217;d have a place to sit and watch. Assuming we got there early enough to actually get a seat and not end up having to stand.<br />
Which of course meant that not only would the office be let out at 16:30 (it was for the last game), but I&#8217;d get stuck in an interview for a new Web Developer position until 16:50. I ended up jogging from the office (corner of 11th Ave. and 3rd St. SE) to the Rose (corner of 15th Ave. and 4th ST. SW) &#8212; a distance of about 11 blocks. All my gym excursions and healthy habits apparently have paid off &#8212; even with poor running shoes, I got there without feeling like I was going to have a heart attack.<br />
Many people sang along with Hockey Night in Canada&#8217;s opening theme, and with &#8220;O Canada&#8221;. But the cheering really didn&#8217;t kick in until the game got going. The series was tied at two games apiece, and both teams needed the advantage. Walking into Game 6 will either be staying alive or trying for the win, and it would better to be the latter.<br />
The volume in the bar was quite high &#8230; and we could barely hear the TVs. Everyone was yelling, shouting, cavorting, and several of us (Paul, Scott, Thelton, Keith, among others) were taking pictures of all the mayhem. Thelton was having particular fun emailing all the photos he&#8217;d taken with his cellphone immediately to the Calgary office email alias, to ensure that everyone arriving in the morning would see all the &#8220;glory&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m sure the patrons downstairs from us really came to despise the noisy folks on the top floor. We would stomp the floor rhythmically, chanting &#8220;Go Flames Go&#8221; as loud as we could. We would scream and yell whenever Calgary got close to Tampa Bay&#8217;s goal. The table of Cory, Chrissie, Michelle, Colin, Neil, Jason, Carl, and Julianne would chant about others in the room, for example: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go , let&#8217;s go!&#8221; until they either acknowledged the chant, or the chanters got bored and picked on someone else.<br />
The game itself was nerve-wracking. It was close. Calgary would score, then Tampa would score. It was tied when the clock ran out, and overtime began. I hate overtime. It&#8217;s such a toss-up. First goal wins, and you really get nervous when pucks get to close to your own goal. Luckily, Kiprusoff is a strong goalie, and Calgary&#8217;s defense was all over Tampa. And so it came down to the last five minutes of the first overtime period when Calgary finally popped the puck in.<br />
Total pandemonium.<br />
Within mere seconds, 17th Ave. was full of people, and traffic evacuated to the side streets. We weren&#8217;t far behind, though we had to do a couple of shots at the bar before we could get out the door. Then it was out to the Red Mile, and wandering in the direction of Melrose. The Red Sea had poured into the Red Mile.<br />
Unlike our previous ventures out onto 17th Ave. (see [[Calgary Flames win Western Conference]] and [[Calgary Flames and the 2004 Stanley Cup]]), this was a warm, dry evening, and was perfect fuel for the flashing fire. As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard (as most of North America has), Calgary&#8217;s Red Mile has turned into a &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; breast-fest of flashing. There&#8217;s websites devoted to this stuff. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll even be able to find videos in adult stores before too long (assuming, of course, that they&#8217;re not already there). It&#8217;s pretty weird, considering how this city is most of the year (save for Stampede, of course). You&#8217;d almost think we were in New Orleans or Mexico&#8230; Am I going to argue about it? No point, and no, it&#8217;s not because I want to encourage it. If people feel that liberated, all the power to them. I just hope that they consider some of the consequences.<br />
Angie got hoisted into the air on Thelton&#8217;s shoulders. Almost immediately, she was surrounded by a multitude of hormone- (and alcohol-) fuelled idiots, calling for Angie to remove her shirt. Angie, who has been known to do daring things in the past (and probably wouldn&#8217;t be objected from doing them under other circumstances) basically told them to grow up and take a hike, and returned to ground level.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay on 17th Ave. for too long, and started off in search of something else. For some reason, that was Cowboys, a bar just north of the railway tracks. After finding Angie&#8217;s car (she couldn&#8217;t quite remember where she&#8217;d parked), we wandered up 5th St., listening to the incoherent shouts above the cacaphony of car horns.<br />
When we arrived at Cowboys, I bade the others a good evening, as I headed home. Why? Simple reason: I have a moral objection to Cowboys. I do not wish to EVER enter an establishment whose waitstaff are known to have breast implants (rumoured to be paid by the bar&#8217;s owner), and over whose door there is a sign that reads: &#8220;Through these doors walk the most beautiful women in Alberta&#8221;. Thanks, but no thanks.<br />
I was quite tired when I finally got home. It was late, I was still a little inebriated, and I had to go to work the next day. One major advantage of having gone drinking with the group, though:<br />
You fall asleep fast.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last night, Alex and I headed down to the Glenmore Reservoir. Reasons were two-fold: One was to have a picnic, a little meal on the edge of the largest body of water in the immediate area. The other was for Alex&#8217;s dragon boat practice. (You might remember that from [[Victoria Day Long Weekend Aftermath]].)<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t particularly good (nor was the fact that the entire city was going gonzo for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals, tying up traffic something awful), but we still managed to make the most of the ham and cheese sandwiches, potato salad, and fruit that we&#8217;d brought with us. The breeze was cool, tempered with a few spots of precipitation. But we still managed to eat most of our food without extreme difficulty. (On a sunnier day, I can see this area being significantly more attractive.)<br />
Leaving some of the fruit behind for post-practice, we ducked over to the McDonald&#8217;s at Glenmore Landing (a small strip mall on the eastern shore of the reservoir) for apple pies. It was my first McDonald&#8217;s apple pie. They&#8217;re not bad. I don&#8217;t want to know what&#8217;s in them, though, since I&#8217;d probably feel the urge to go into a full cleanse to get that gunk back out of me.<br />
Soon, we were at the boat dock, waiting for the rest of Alex&#8217;s team to show up. The game would keep many of them away, leaving only about eight people out of the usual 20-person team. Which is how I got sucked into all of this.<br />
I was a decided spectator. I had thought about doing dragon boat racing when I lived in Vancouver, but the team never really took off in the last year I was able to apply. Until I&#8217;d met Alex, I didn&#8217;t even know there was racing in Calgary! But sure enough, every August, there&#8217;s a festival on the reservoir. Apparently, it&#8217;s quite large. And unless things change between Alex and I (highly unlikely), I&#8217;ll get to find out what it&#8217;s like.<br />
The current question, though, is whether I&#8217;ll get to see it as a spectator or as a participant.<br />
With so few people out, I was asked to join them on the water. (I had planned to listen to the game in the car.) I was in the process of politely refusing when I saw the expectant smile on Alex&#8217;s face.<br />
Hook, line, and sinker.<br />
Bundled up, lifejacket on, and paddle in hand, I followed the others down to the long, white canoe at the dock. Dragon boats are long &#8212; 20 people rowing, one helmsman, and one &#8220;drummer&#8221;. This means the boats are also fairly tall on the water (until you get people into them, anyway). I was positioned slightly ahead of middle, seated next to Moustafa, a veteran from last year. Once we were all in, we headed off onto the lake. And a lot of back pain.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t injure myself. It&#8217;s from the rowing. Dragon boats aren&#8217;t paddled like a canoe. When you paddle a canoe, you look forward, and paddle with your arms and upper body. The motion is simple, and unless you&#8217;re paddling hard, there&#8217;s not too much to it. Dragon boats, on the other hand, are quite something else. To maximize power, you need to hold the paddle with straight arms (ideally, when you&#8217;re holding the paddle correctly, your body and paddle form an &#8216;A&#8217;, with torso and arm creating one side, lower arm creating the cross, and paddle forming the other side). You stroke by rotating your arms opposite to rotating your torso. It&#8217;s a bit weird to explain, but once you see it, it makes sense.<br />
And it hurts. Especially when you&#8217;re under power. Which were were. Several times.<br />
But the technique isn&#8217;t too hard to pick up. The trick then is timing. You need everyone in the boat to have the same timing for strokes. When people are out of stroke, you lose power. The most power is gained when everyone strokes at the same time. It wasn&#8217;t hard to tell just in our practices. Our coach, Albert, had the most power, and was something to behold. He&#8217;s been doing it a few years, though, so his strength is not to be unexpected.<br />
I was tired by the time we got into shore. Like with many things, I pushed myself quite hard. I hope my back doesn&#8217;t avenge itself on me tomorrow, though. (Yoga might help, though, if it does.) But I think I&#8217;m getting addicted. I can see myself doing this. I don&#8217;t really know why, other than it&#8217;s fun.<br />
Certainly beats just watching.</p>
