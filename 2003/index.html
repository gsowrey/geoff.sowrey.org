	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept fitfully. I don&#8217;t really know why. But when I awoke Christmas morning, there was a slight sense of excitement. Perhaps I&#8217;d been depressed the day before and not taken notice. (The reason why, of course, still remains a mystery.) It&#8217;s just as easy to believe that there was nothing special about this day, nothing more than the same dull drudgery I feel that I face more often than I care to admit to.<br />
I showered, shaved, and dressed for the day. I would not return until after Christmas dinner, so the objective was to look as presentable as possible, without being uncomfortable all day long. Fed the cat, and hopped in my car for Brenda and Mike&#8217;s. I was to be there for 9:00, so we could begin Christmas morning.<br />
Mom and Nana were running a little late, but not so much that the entire day was thrown out of whack. They arrived not long after me, and with mimosas and/or coffee in hand, we proceeded to the living room. There were six of us, and more than enough presents all around. We even had stockings, despite protests that we didn&#8217;t really need them.<br />
Inside, the slight excitement grew. Unfortunately, the feeling was a little sickening, becase it felt materialistic. I didn&#8217;t want to receive gifts so much as I wanted to give them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I like receiving gifts as much as the next person, but the acquisition of materials goods just isn&#8217;t the driving force for me that used to rule my early childhood. The anticipation, however &#8212; that I will never miss.<br />
Jen got a digital camera, one she has to share with Brenda. The key reason is that so Jen will have it when she goes to Japan with me in late March. It will be an experience of a lifetime, and she needs to record every event. Mike and Jen played with it most of the morning &#8230; no, I take that back &#8212; most of the day. Mom received a personal chef service from the family, and a foot massager from Cathy, Craig, and myself. Brenda received some nice clothes, as did Nana. Mike made off with a Belgian beer selection.<br />
As for me, I got a good book on the Canadian Pacific Railway (&#8220;Stand Fast, Craigellachie!&#8221;), a pocket watch with an engraved train, funds for landscaping the house, movies, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and a cuckoo clock. The clock, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a Mini-brand product. Every hour, instead of a little bird, a little red car pops out of its little doors, revs its engine, and beeps its horn. Cathy couldn&#8217;t resist getting it for me. I could barely stop giggling.<br />
The video game (&#8220;Grand Theft Auto&#8221;) came from Tamara, my roommate. This had been a trying year for us. Tamara was laid off from Critical Mass in June. In lieu of her having to move out, I just didn&#8217;t ask for rent. Until she was contracted back (for five months!), Tamara didn&#8217;t pay rent. I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; why would I do that? Simple: It&#8217;s far harder to find a perfect roommate than it is to lose money. Considering how well we get along, the last thing I needed was for her to have to move out. With her contract now expired, that is a possibility, but one I hope won&#8217;t come soon. Tamara and I both know the situation, and how it makes the other person feel. Tamara&#8217;s card, despite being aimed at young children, made me cry.<br />
Breakfast followed, as did my traditional butt-whipping at video games. (Jen usually creams me on the game of choice.) By 15:00, it was time to head up to Nana&#8217;s. We had to prepare for dinner.<br />
When Nana had moved into her complex, she had immediately made arrangements for us to use the Family Dining Room for our great family feast. While all fine and dandy, this did pose a couple of logistical problems, most notably the cooking of the turkey. (In fact, this simple thing created what I can only describe as the first great family feud in my memory. In the end, Uncle David took over turkey preparation, while Mom and Brenda just fumed about the whole situation.) Seating arrangements weren&#8217;t too difficult to sort out.<br />
The feud did not continue when everyone arrived. Instead, we prepared dinner, with everyone chipping in for details (moving furniture, making parts of the meals, grabbing things from Nana&#8217;s room). By 17:45, we were all seated around the massive table, eating. It was the earliest I can ever remember having Christmas dinner.<br />
Following the meal, and before we all partook of dessert, Uncle David presented a slide show. They were old photos of the family from the 1940s and 1950s, when the &#8220;children&#8221; (namely, Mom, David, and Brenda) were still young. Some of the slides were creepy &#8212; there were two where we were all convinced the subject was Cathy, not Mom.<br />
By 21:00, the Family Dining Room looked like we hadn&#8217;t even been there. Everything was cleaned, packed up, and on its way back out to the cars. We grouped together in a room just off the lobby, overlooking the complex&#8217;s dining room, for a family photo. Darren, Jen, and I all took ones with our digital cameras. I wish I&#8217;d brought my larger one &#8212; it can handle the zoom a lot better than my small one.<br />
I was back at the gym bright and early the next morning. I had a very high calorie dinner to try and burn off. I didn&#8217;t get through a lot of it, because I had to be at Pam&#8217;s for 10:30 for brunch. It was the collection of families that had been at the Hovey&#8217;s two nights earlier (see [[It Just Doesn&#8217;t Feel Like Christmas Eve]]), just a different venue. Pam and crew had been preparing breakfast for some time. We mingled until the breakfast bell was rung, and it was time to eat. I have gotta get the recipe for Pam&#8217;s mediterranean breakfast dish. Very tasty.<br />
During breakfast, an idea crept through my little head. It&#8217;s Friday, and I want to go see a matinee. Specifically, &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221;. It dawned on me that Jen had probably not seen it. Sure enough, she hadn&#8217;t. I proposed a plan to relieve Mike and Brenda of their daughter for the afternoon, doing some shopping down at A&amp;B Sound (the two of us had gift certificates to take care of), and then see the movie. All parties were in favour.<br />
A&amp;B Sound was far from packed, but we&#8217;d also long-missed the door crasher specials they&#8217;d had when the doors opened at 7:00 that morning. Fortunately, the discounts on white- and red-tagged prices were still in effect. It also meant we could get through the store without constantly bumping into people, and not spend forever in the checkout line.<br />
Dumping our new-gotten goods in the car, we headed over to Eau Claire Market for the movie. Having a little time before the movie, we endulged in some games in the adjacent arcade. Either Jen was having an off day, or was being merciful. I won all three games of air hockey, a fighting game (Marvel vs. Capcom, if memory serves me right) that I had no idea how to play or what was going on, and a racing game that really wasn&#8217;t that good anyway. Jen still served me my heiny on a platter in Soul Caliber 2, though.<br />
Popcorn and pop in hand, we sat down for the movie. A long one, too. But an interesting one. Not everyone is a fan of Tom Cruise, but he does a very good job in this movie. The short explanation is that it&#8217;s about a civil war veteran who ends up in Japan during the Meiji Reformation to train Japan&#8217;s new army in modern weapons. He&#8217;s captured by the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a group of samurai) and learns about the way of the warrior &#8212; something he&#8217;d lost while fighting in America. Knowing something of Japanese history, it was quite interesting to see, and I wonder how accurate it might really be.<br />
Returning to the Znack&#8217;s, we had leftovers from last night&#8217;s dinner. Just not quite so much. I didn&#8217;t stay too late, though, as I had laundry to tackle &#8212; I&#8217;m running out of clean clothes.<br />
Besides, it gave me a great excuse to watch the movies I got for Christmas.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Tis the night before Christmas,<br />
and all through the house,<br />
the cat is sound sleeping,<br />
as I sit here with my mouse.<br />
No stockings are hung<br />
by a chimney with care,<br />
just thrown in the laundry bin<br />
&#8216;cuz I have more to wear<br />
No children are nestled<br />
all snug in their beds,<br />
The only visions I see<br />
are of oncoming dread.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already noticed, I&#8217;m a little down this Christmas. I mean, it&#8217;s Christmas Eve, and I&#8217;m sitting in front of my computer, wondering what all the hulabaloo is about. When I was a kid &#8212; heck, even two years ago (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]) &#8212; Christmas meant something. It was an occasion. As I sit here in front of my computer, it&#8217;s just a day, no different than any other.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas. Maybe because there was no lead-in, no real build-up. It&#8217;s just &#8220;here&#8221;. Sure, I went to the malls &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t have missed the Christmas decorations if you were Helen Keller. But that&#8217;s not Christmas to me. My mother is here, as is a large portion of my family. Cathy and Craig are back in Oakville, and my Aunt Ruth and cousins Erica and Lauren are in the Toronto area. But is it their presence I miss?<br />
Last year was my first Christmas in Calgary. I have family here &#8212; I didn&#8217;t really miss anything. But is it that? Is that what I am missing? Not just my family here &#8212; but *all* of my family? I don&#8217;t know. Sure, it&#8217;s the second Christmas in a row without Cathy. Without my immediate family. It&#8217;s also the second Christmas without Dad. No loud Christmas music, no massive amounts of decorations, none of the usual triggers one would expect for this season.<br />
At least, none for me. There are plenty of other people looking forward to tomorrow. But not me. It&#8217;s just another day, just one where I don&#8217;t have to work. I think, if anything, I&#8217;m a little depressed. It&#8217;s too easy to lose touch with the things you need or want. It&#8217;s not about possessions &#8212; it&#8217;s about feeling. And maybe this year, I&#8217;m not feeling up to snuff.<br />
Earlier this year, I started dating someone for the first time since arriving in Calgary. While we are no longer together (we are friends), that experience awoke a number of things within me that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. I suppose it&#8217;s wholly possible that some of these feelings are contributing to the problems I&#8217;m having. It could be that I&#8217;m incapable of enjoying Christmas this year because of that.<br />
But admittedly, I don&#8217;t really know. All I do know is that it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas to me. And I can only hope that the feeling is short-lived. I don&#8217;t want to go through the rest of my life feeling like this every December 25th.<br />
But don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t spend my time at home this evening. Tonight, we went out to visit with Aunt Alaine&#8217;s family, who are holding court out in Chestermere, about 20 kms east of Calgary along Hwy 16 (aka Trans Canada Highway). It&#8217;s a short drive, not far from my Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike&#8217;s &#8230; or would be, if we had proper directions.<br />
Getting to Chestermere is easy, don&#8217;t get me wrong. What&#8217;s not so easy? Finding the right house. Why is this so difficult? Because we neglected to get the address, or directions once inside Chestermere before we left the house. This left us circling the endless labyrinth of streets in a vain search for the Hovey residence.<br />
Jen and I got frustrated. While everyone else seemed content to say &#8220;Oh! *This* is the right street!&#8221;, we were content to grab the cell phone, call the house, and announce that we were lost and needed directions. (I was a bit snarky about it, too &#8212; probably a result of the aforementioned frustration.)<br />
Unlike previous excursions to the Hovey&#8217;s (at Easter &#8212; see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]], my family would not be the only ones in attendance. The Tisdales were already in attendance, as were the various relatives on Alaine&#8217;s side of the yard. Several &#8220;kids&#8221; (namely, those a lot younger than I). Luckily, I get along well with the rest of the adults.<br />
We left shortly after 22:00, returning to Calgary. After a brief stop at Brenda and Mike&#8217;s, I drove Mom and Nana to Nana&#8217;s complex, where I swapped the van for my car (left at the complex when we&#8217;d done a run up earlier in the day). In a few short hours, I will be back at Chez Znack for Christmas Day.<br />
Something that, for what seems to be the first time in my life, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, the Greedy Bastard hit Cowtown.<br />
The Bastard in question, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is Eric Idle. For those of you buried under rocks since the day of your birth, Eric was one of Britain&#8217;s Monty Python comedy troupe, makers of several years of quality British television and such movies as &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Life of Brian&#8221;, and &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s The Meaning of Life&#8221;.<br />
Eric is self-described as the sixth most friendly Python, after Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, and John Cleese. For those of you unawares, there are only six members of Monty Python. Having now met the man in person, he certainly is pleasant enough.<br />
Eric is the only current touring (former) member of Monty Python. John has a successful acting career (although Eric&#8217;s is fairly prolific), Michael has done several series for the BBC (a documentary-like version of &#8220;Around the World in 80 Days&#8221;), Terry Gilliam is one of Hollywood&#8217;s more ecclectic directors, and Terry Jones has done some bit parts and a few books (he co-authored &#8220;Starship Titanic&#8221; with &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; author Douglas Adams). Graham Chapman died in 1989.<br />
This time through North America (running October to the end of December), Eric&#8217;s running under the banner: &#8220;The Greedy Ba$tard Tour: Another Stupid Evening&#8230;&#8221;. For all those who think he&#8217;s doing it just for money, he&#8217;ll agree with you 100% of the way. As he started off when he came on stage: &#8220;This is to earn money so I can send my daughter through college &#8230; and my wife through collegen.&#8221;<br />
Tamara, Nick, and I went in a group of three, but weren&#8217;t the only Critical Mass folk out. Steve was there with his girlfriend, as was John with his. I can only assume there were others, but we never saw any of them. It was good to see that the three of us weren&#8217;t the only ones interested in a good laugh.<br />
We arrived at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Theatre (usually referred to as just &#8220;The Jubilee&#8221;) around 19:35, for a 20:00 show. Nick and I are Python fans &#8212; Nick even knows some of the The Rutles (Eric&#8217;s answer to The Beatles). Checking the coats (and stashing the camera), we headed in to find our seats.<br />
I&#8217;d never been to The Jubilee before. It&#8217;s not at all what I expected. It&#8217;s attached to the Alberta College of Art and Design (known more informally as ACAD), but does not look at all like a school auditorium. It&#8217;s a three-tiered honest-to-God theatre, regularly hosting operas and ballets. Tonight, it hosted an &#8220;adults-only&#8221; show. Some of Python&#8217;s material, and some of Eric&#8217;s comedy, is not for kids.<br />
The stage was simple: a small piano on the (audience&#8217;s) left side, and a coat rack, chair, guitar stand, and throw rug on the right. Music played softly as people entered the auditorium. With only minutes to the show, the music became louder, as The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; started playing. Several people in the audience did the motions in the chorus. Then one of the actors (it wasn&#8217;t Eric) walked out on stage as one of the Gumbys &#8212; a Python character known for abject stupidity. He attempted the chorus motions. The audience laughed.<br />
The music changed to the infamous &#8220;Spam&#8221; theme, sung by ancient Vikings. (Yep, another Python skit.) On came Eric, to a cacaphony of whistles, hollers, yells, screams, and a lot of clapping. After the crowd calmed down, he started into his routine, pausing only to introduce something never done before: the Encore Bucket.<br />
This was a shiny, stainless steel garbage can. It&#8217;s Eric&#8217;s way of ensuring that he comes on for an encore. The idea is that you throw money in there (or women&#8217;s underwear &#8212; he&#8217;s trying to break through the Tom Jones Barrier), and if there&#8217;s enough, he&#8217;ll do an encore. In reality, all money collected goes to charity (Eric keeps the underwear). So if you&#8217;re seeing Eric Idle&#8217;s Greedy Bastard Tour, bring a few extra bucks for charity.<br />
The only time he took a truly serious note was to mark that tonight is the second anniversary of George Harrison&#8217;s death. Harrison produced movies, and footed the entire bill for &#8220;Life of Brian&#8221;. As Eric put it: &#8220;The most expensive movie ticket, ever!&#8221; Eric and George had been good friends for many years.<br />
As Eric&#8217;s opening dialogue went on, he explained that he had been to The Jubilee before &#8212; 30 years ago, with the rest of Monty Python, on the first (and last) tour of Canada. Eric has been through Canada a couple of times since (his previous tour was &#8220;Eric Idle Exploits Monty Python&#8221;). On his last tour, he was presented with none other than the Monty Python hook, a very long, crooked pole used to drag people offstage in their skits. The group had left it behind in Vancouver at the end of their tour 30 years ago, and Eric was presented it when he returned a couple of years ago.<br />
As he said: &#8220;I can only imagine what this would fetch on eBay!&#8221;<br />
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical as to the content of the show. I mean, I like Monty Python a lot, but would the show really be anything original? It was just Eric, and there&#8217;s no telling if the rest of the players would have the same comedic timing of Python. I was quite happily relieved to find that Eric&#8217;s happy band of six people (including himself) were quite up to the task. And even after many shows, his co-players can still crack up on stage.<br />
We were treated to many classic Python songs, including &#8220;The Penis Song&#8221;, &#8220;The Philosopher&#8217;s Song&#8221;, &#8220;Sit On My Face&#8221;, &#8220;Eric The Half-A-Bee&#8221;, &#8220;I Like Chinese&#8221;, &#8220;Galaxy Song&#8221;, and of course, the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221;. We hoped for &#8220;Every Sperm Is Sacred&#8221;, but not that night. (Tamara had never heard the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221; before, but had it stuck in her head from the moment she heard it until well after we were home.)<br />
The tickets weren&#8217;t cheap ($55), but it was worth every penny. The show was funny, and even localized. (They rewrote the &#8220;Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge&#8221; skit so that the wife was from Okotoks &#8212; something we found extremely funny, because Tamara&#8217;s from Okotoks.) They included some Canadian humour, including ye olde poke fun at Americans.<br />
Two and a half hours after the show started, it was over. Nick and I ran into the autograph line so we could get things signed. We had hoped for the DVDs we had brought, but a sign read: &#8220;The Greedy Bastard will only sign purchased merchandise&#8221;. Thirty dollars later, I have a signed t-shirt. Hey, I might never get another chance to meet a Python.<br />
I did get a chance to speak to Eric. I thanked him for coming to Calgary, and hoped he would return again. He looked quite tired (the show takes a lot out of you when you&#8217;re 62 years young), but was still the quintessential showman.<br />
Even for a self-proclaimed Bastard.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Friday night was not fun. Erin and I got together after work, headed down to her place to eat pizza and watch Indiana Jones movies. Or at least that was the plan. We watched the second half of &#8220;Last Crusade&#8221; (having started it a couple nights earlier), and had a great time. But as we started to watch &#8220;Temple of Doom&#8221;, things turned a slightly darker note.<br />
We&#8217;d been discussing why I *hate* dancing. (It&#8217;s a long, sordid story that I&#8217;m not going to detail here.) Erin wanted to know why, but I didn&#8217;t want to tell her. She kept at it, repeatedly demanding to know. Suddenly, I found myself blasted four years into the past, and it wasn&#8217;t Erin who was asking me, it was Allison.<br />
All the dread, fear, anguish, and pain that I had thought long gone washed over me like an oil spill washing up on a rocky shore. I felt completely helpless. For almost a half hour, I was unable to do or say anything. Erin was beside herself &#8212; she had no idea what to do. She&#8217;d never seen this sort of thing before, and didn&#8217;t know how to handle it. Not that I could blame her.<br />
It&#8217;s a test. Not an intentional one, I have to say, but it is a test nonetheless. A test of how we deal with problems when they arise, and a test of how I&#8217;m able to adjust having someone else in my life again. Had this happened on my own, I&#8217;d probably have just gone for a walk, watched a movie, played a game, something to dull the mind. But not anymore, now I need to work it through. It&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; I&#8217;ve let these old issues sit far too long.<br />
Saturday got off to a slow start. I didn&#8217;t sleep well at all. I ached all over, and memories of the night before were still far too fresh in my mind. But I looked at the day with fresher eyes &#8212; I wanted to have a good day.<br />
Erin and I met up with her parents and Aunt Edie at Joey Tomato&#8217;s at Chinook a few minutes before noon. Erin&#8217;s father was parading around in shorts, despite the fact that the outside temperature was barely 10 degrees. (Later, I would agree with the choice of attire, since the temperature would rise throughout the day.)<br />
Lunch was excellent, of course, though a little quieter than some of the meals I&#8217;ve had with Erin&#8217;s family. Well, quiet except when Erin&#8217;s dad was prodding me to rib Erin a little bit. Not that it takes much to get me to do it, I&#8217;m nearly convinced Erin&#8217;s dad loves it when I&#8217;m the antagonist.<br />
After lunch, Erin, her mom, and her aunt went shopping. Erin&#8217;s dad and I sauntered across Macleod to the Staples. Erin&#8217;s dad wanted my opinion on a scanner he had put on hold. This was the first time I&#8217;d been left alone with Erin&#8217;s father. It&#8217;s probably the single most nerve-wracking thing for a guy to go through. Erin had already been left alone with my aunt, grandmother, and cousins, so it was only fair (certainly to a point) that I spend some time with just her father, even if under the pretenses of assisting in buying a scanner.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen the Canon LiDE 80 before &#8212; it&#8217;s a new one to me. (Not that I&#8217;ve researched scanners for a while.) But it&#8217;s small, light, powered through the USB port, and comes with a negative scanning adapter (definitely a useful tool). I want one. I haven&#8217;t had a scanner in almost four years, and I have to say, I need one badly. I&#8217;ve got a huge pile of photographs and negatives just calling out to be scanned. I just don&#8217;t have $250 laying around to be used.<br />
Oh well, things to plan for.<br />
Dropping the scanner off in the car, Erin&#8217;s dad and I retreated to Chapters to wait for Erin, her mom, and her aunt. We shared a hot chocolate and cranberry juice, chatted, and waited. Didn&#8217;t take too long before we were all reunited. The reunion was short, as Erin&#8217;s parents and aunt had other things to do.<br />
Erin and I took off to 17th Ave. This is one of Calgary&#8217;s prime shopping areas. It&#8217;s also home to Erin&#8217;s favourite store: I-Appeal. If Erin had the chance, she&#8217;d probably buy everything in the store to decorate her condo. But she had a limit of $20, keeping her to just two &#8220;decorative&#8221; elves. (I think they&#8217;re kinda creepily ugly, personally, but Erin thinks they&#8217;re the bees knees.)<br />
Plans that evening were to attend a long-delayed housewarming for Fritz and Jin. This, of course, means I needed to bring a suitable housewarming gift. For some reason, I&#8217;m a big fan of glass flower vases &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why. As Fritz is a Designer (and certainly Jin is quite stylish), I needed something that would be suitable. Luckily, I-Appeal had just what I was looking for.<br />
After a quick stop at Blockbuster (gift certificates), it was into Reid&#8217;s for some wrapping paper. We then wandered over to 8th St. to stop into Janice Beaton. It had been far too long since my last high-quality cheese fix. I tried to convince Erin that she needed to try some, but it seems there&#8217;s desire for cheese &#8212; and then there&#8217;s me. (I did manage to convince her a little later.) Of course, we had to stop in Bernard Callebaut (it&#8217;s almost impossible to pass it by) for a couple bites. A short stop at the house (to drop off the cheese and wrap the present), and we were off to Fritz and Jin&#8217;s.<br />
Fritz and Jin moved into their condo in July (see [[Painting my house (among other things)]]), after waiting another year following their condo burning down (luckily, they hadn&#8217;t been living there at the time) in a collosal fire. Although housewarmings usually take place not long after moving in, Fritz and Jin had some things they had to attend to, first. So, almost three months later, they finally got to have their party.<br />
Well, the first of a couple, anyway. They&#8217;ve got co-workers and Jin&#8217;s friends to deal with, as well.<br />
Erin and I were the first to arrive. No big surprise there &#8212; our group of friends aren&#8217;t exactly the most punctual kind. It gave us time to chat with Fritz and Jin until the others started to appear. Doug, Jensenne and Jon, Virgil, Jon and Pearl, and Teak and Rose soon rounded out our little group. With the tour of the condo out of the way, we proceeded to scatter about the kitchen/dining/living space and chat.<br />
Some of us hadn&#8217;t seen the others in quite some time. For example, I can&#8217;t really remember the last time I saw Jon and Pearl, but it had been quite a while. It was there that we found out for the first time that they&#8217;re getting engaged &#8212; they just have to wait for the ring. Good news, indeed.<br />
Food was plentiful, if perhaps on the not-quite-so nutritious side &#8212; Asian snack foods. Tasty, but not exactly wholesome. Real food came in the form of pizza, which Fritz and Doug went to pick up.<br />
This group is loosely known as the ABCs &#8212; the Asian Brother Crew. This is Chris&#8217; name for the lot of us. The only missing members were Calvin (MIA, near as we could tell), Chris (still in Japan), Adrian (in Japan, visiting Chris), and Tamara (who, sadly, forgot). As it had been a very long time since the last time together, we marked the occasion with a photograph.<br />
The evening would not end there, however. One thing we particularly like doing is bowl. Yeah, kinda hokey, I know, but it&#8217;s fun. Especially when we&#8217;re making fun of the way we play. So we all raced up to Let&#8217;s Bowl in the Northeast &#8212; our favourite lane. As it was 21:30 when we arrived, we figured on a decent amount of time to play. Or so we thought.<br />
An hour and a half wait. For all the times we&#8217;d been there before, we&#8217;d *never* seen a wait that long. And we weren&#8217;t about to wait. A hurried conversation of where to go next drummed up Pacific Place (formerly known as Franklin Mall), which had bowling lanes. Best part was, it was only a few minutes drive away.<br />
Erin and I initially lost everyone else. They&#8217;d gone around front, where they couldn&#8217;t get into the bowling alley. Erin and I went around back (actually by mistake). A few cell phone calls later, and everyone was assembled to play. Our hopes were initially dashed a wee bit when we realized it was five pin bowling instead of the usual 10-pin. It had been a long time since the last time I&#8217;d bowled five pin (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and I was kind of looking forward to it.<br />
And as it was Erin&#8217;s first time bowling in 14 years, I think she was looking forward to it, too.<br />
I won&#8217;t recount the games &#8212; there&#8217;s no point. Erin did far better than she thought she would (I&#8217;m sure). I bowled okay, though I kept shooting to the left, for some reason. And right after we noticed that the display not only showed the score but also how fast the ball was moving, a few of us tried to get the fastest throw. Fritz won with 43.5 km/h. (I could only do 42.3 km/h.)<br />
The game, and the party, broke up after that. Most of us were tired &#8212; it had been a long day for all. (Especially Teak, who&#8217;d played two back-to-back games of street hockey before coming to the party.)<br />
Can&#8217;t wait until someone else buys a home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s not every day that you turn 30. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s long since been my turn.<br />
This time, it was for my friend Teak. You may remember Teak from a previous birthday of his, when Chris and I felt the need for a little revenge (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). Having no reason to torture my friend, I felt it necessary to show my support for a fellow over-the-hiller.<br />
Teak had reserved the upper floor of Soho, one of the trendier bars in town. Why the upper floor? Teak knows how to throw a party &#8212; he invited 250 people. Now the first rule of parties is to always invite a lot more people than you expect to show up, because about half won&#8217;t come. Teak planned for that, and the upmost floor was ideally suited for 100-130 people.<br />
Tamara, Sheldon (Tamara&#8217;s new boyfriend), and I headed out shortly before 19:30 to rendezvous with the gathering throng at Soho. We were among the first to arrive. Such is the norm, really &#8212; most people seem to like doing what they did in high school, and be fashionably late.<br />
In our haste to leave the house, I realized (much to my chagrin) that I&#8217;d forgotten my camera. I had only recently got it back from Adrian, who had taken it on his whirlwind trip to Japan and the Philippines. I wanted to take photos at Teak&#8217;s birthday &#8212; mostly for Chris, who&#8217;s still trapped in Japan.<br />
Soon, members of the ABC (Asian Brother Crew) started to appear. Fritz and Jin were the first (after Tamara and I), followed soon after by Adrian. Doug appeared not too long after. A few others from Critical Mass (Karen, Mark G., Mark E.) also arrived, as did Arif (arriving with Teak&#8217;s girlfriend Rose), Arthur (with friend Tanya), and former teammate Bonnie (with partner Mandy). We were outnumbered, however, by the rest of Teak&#8217;s friends, a few of whom I vaguely knew.<br />
Tamara and Sheldon didn&#8217;t stay too long before leaving. They didn&#8217;t quite feel like they fit in. (And I did?) I hung out for a while with the ABCs, talked with Bonnie and Mandy for a long time, and then had a long chat with Arthur and Tanya. I couldn&#8217;t stay too long, as my stamina isn&#8217;t quite what it usually is. But without knowing it, I&#8217;d lasted until after midnight.<br />
Arriving home, I flopped on the couch to peruse the late night Saturday television lineup. But once Miao Yin had made herself comfortable in my lap, staying awake just wasn&#8217;t a possibility. I passed out. Explains the kink in my neck.<br />
I&#8217;m getting too old for this.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/" rel="bookmark">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have learned from my jaunt out on Thursday night (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]). I guess I did to a point, but I made one key error: I went out to celebrate Jim&#8217;s birthday.<br />
For the record, Jim&#8217;s a great guy. He&#8217;s a lot of fun &#8212; he has no inhibitions to speak of, he lives more on the edge than most (especially when it comes to skiing), and lives for the moment. He&#8217;s a great web developer, he&#8217;s inquisitive, and is always interested in pushing the boundaries of website development. Unlike most people, Jim doesn&#8217;t really have a shell to come out of &#8212; he wears pretty much all his internal organs on his sleeves.<br />
What&#8217;s all this mean? Well, when you receive an invitation from Jim, asking you to attend an evening of drinking, you can immediately know where it&#8217;ll likely head. The fact that today is Jim&#8217;s 26th birthday made events of last night all the more &#8230; necessary.<br />
I arrived at Jim&#8217;s apartment (a two-minute walk from the venerable Rose &amp; Crown pub) shortly after 20:00, the approximate time we were asked to arrive. Upon entering the apartment to the loud calls of Scott (who&#8217;d arrived mere moments before me), James (already quite well into the bag), and two of Jim&#8217;s friends (whose names I&#8217;m drawing a blank on), I was informed of the house rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No smoking inside. (No worries there.)</li>
<li>No throwing large objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, there were no other rules. But there was a bit of preparation.<br />
As each person arrived, they had to roll dice. For most people, it was three. Women only had to roll two. Mia and Lindsay got away with only one &#8212; Mia was on antibiotics, so was taking a (wisely) careful approach. The number you rolled were the number of drinks you had to have before the night was over. The rules (as stated by Jim) meant that all ones were actually sevens. Thusly, the drink minimum was six, and the maximum was 21. Jim (and Luke, the co-birthday boy) each had to drink 26, because that&#8217;s their new age.<br />
I rolled a 17. Figures. James rolled a 20. He finished even before we left for the Rose &amp; Crown.<br />
To ensure that everyone had their share, you strung the number of candies (taken from a candy necklace) onto a piece of dental floss, which you wore around your necklace. For each drink you finished, you ate one of the candies. Beers and shots counted as one. For pints, it was in groups of three: first pint was a single drink, the next two were two drinks each, for a total of five.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if anyone every really put that rule to the test.<br />
With most of the group assembled around 23:30, we departed for the Rose &amp; Crown (Mia and Lindsay had come and gone by that time). It was cold, but the alcohol kept us (somewhat) warm. Luke bypassed the pub, saying he needed food. He never came back. We kept going at the Rose &amp; Crown, talking drinking, and eating nachos until &#8230; well, until you couldn&#8217;t hang out any longer.<br />
I stopped around 1:30 or so. I was out of money (I had budgeted myself as a limiting device) and feeling kinda tired. I also didn&#8217;t want to relive Friday when I woke up later this morning. So it was off towards home, stopping at Canadian Pizza Unlimited for a little repast, and at the Mac&#8217;s to pick up a litre of Gatorade and a small bag of chips. (Gatorade restores the salts, etc. your body loses while drinking.)<br />
Falling asleep on the couch, I awoke only when Tamara came crashing through the door around 4:00. I don&#8217;t wholly remember her return. I just rolled over and went back to sleep. I haven&#8217;t slept that well in a long time.<br />
Aside from being really tired, I had a much better day than on Friday. Oddly enough, it felt really good to just laze around for a change. It&#8217;s been a while since I outright relaxed. I can only imagine what kind of a day Jim must&#8217;ve had. But something tells me that he wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was not so great &#8212; he almost certainly had a great time last night.<br />
As for me, I think I&#8217;m going to remain sober for a while yet to come. Two nights of debauchery in such close proximity isn&#8217;t good for me. I might begin to like it.<br />
Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t finish the 17. I might have actually had 13 drinks, including shots. Even then, I&#8217;m not too sure. It was probably less &#8212; I cheated a couple of times.</p>
