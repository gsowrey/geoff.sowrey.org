	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept fitfully. I don&#8217;t really know why. But when I awoke Christmas morning, there was a slight sense of excitement. Perhaps I&#8217;d been depressed the day before and not taken notice. (The reason why, of course, still remains a mystery.) It&#8217;s just as easy to believe that there was nothing special about this day, nothing more than the same dull drudgery I feel that I face more often than I care to admit to.<br />
I showered, shaved, and dressed for the day. I would not return until after Christmas dinner, so the objective was to look as presentable as possible, without being uncomfortable all day long. Fed the cat, and hopped in my car for Brenda and Mike&#8217;s. I was to be there for 9:00, so we could begin Christmas morning.<br />
Mom and Nana were running a little late, but not so much that the entire day was thrown out of whack. They arrived not long after me, and with mimosas and/or coffee in hand, we proceeded to the living room. There were six of us, and more than enough presents all around. We even had stockings, despite protests that we didn&#8217;t really need them.<br />
Inside, the slight excitement grew. Unfortunately, the feeling was a little sickening, becase it felt materialistic. I didn&#8217;t want to receive gifts so much as I wanted to give them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I like receiving gifts as much as the next person, but the acquisition of materials goods just isn&#8217;t the driving force for me that used to rule my early childhood. The anticipation, however &#8212; that I will never miss.<br />
Jen got a digital camera, one she has to share with Brenda. The key reason is that so Jen will have it when she goes to Japan with me in late March. It will be an experience of a lifetime, and she needs to record every event. Mike and Jen played with it most of the morning &#8230; no, I take that back &#8212; most of the day. Mom received a personal chef service from the family, and a foot massager from Cathy, Craig, and myself. Brenda received some nice clothes, as did Nana. Mike made off with a Belgian beer selection.<br />
As for me, I got a good book on the Canadian Pacific Railway (&#8220;Stand Fast, Craigellachie!&#8221;), a pocket watch with an engraved train, funds for landscaping the house, movies, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and a cuckoo clock. The clock, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a Mini-brand product. Every hour, instead of a little bird, a little red car pops out of its little doors, revs its engine, and beeps its horn. Cathy couldn&#8217;t resist getting it for me. I could barely stop giggling.<br />
The video game (&#8220;Grand Theft Auto&#8221;) came from Tamara, my roommate. This had been a trying year for us. Tamara was laid off from Critical Mass in June. In lieu of her having to move out, I just didn&#8217;t ask for rent. Until she was contracted back (for five months!), Tamara didn&#8217;t pay rent. I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; why would I do that? Simple: It&#8217;s far harder to find a perfect roommate than it is to lose money. Considering how well we get along, the last thing I needed was for her to have to move out. With her contract now expired, that is a possibility, but one I hope won&#8217;t come soon. Tamara and I both know the situation, and how it makes the other person feel. Tamara&#8217;s card, despite being aimed at young children, made me cry.<br />
Breakfast followed, as did my traditional butt-whipping at video games. (Jen usually creams me on the game of choice.) By 15:00, it was time to head up to Nana&#8217;s. We had to prepare for dinner.<br />
When Nana had moved into her complex, she had immediately made arrangements for us to use the Family Dining Room for our great family feast. While all fine and dandy, this did pose a couple of logistical problems, most notably the cooking of the turkey. (In fact, this simple thing created what I can only describe as the first great family feud in my memory. In the end, Uncle David took over turkey preparation, while Mom and Brenda just fumed about the whole situation.) Seating arrangements weren&#8217;t too difficult to sort out.<br />
The feud did not continue when everyone arrived. Instead, we prepared dinner, with everyone chipping in for details (moving furniture, making parts of the meals, grabbing things from Nana&#8217;s room). By 17:45, we were all seated around the massive table, eating. It was the earliest I can ever remember having Christmas dinner.<br />
Following the meal, and before we all partook of dessert, Uncle David presented a slide show. They were old photos of the family from the 1940s and 1950s, when the &#8220;children&#8221; (namely, Mom, David, and Brenda) were still young. Some of the slides were creepy &#8212; there were two where we were all convinced the subject was Cathy, not Mom.<br />
By 21:00, the Family Dining Room looked like we hadn&#8217;t even been there. Everything was cleaned, packed up, and on its way back out to the cars. We grouped together in a room just off the lobby, overlooking the complex&#8217;s dining room, for a family photo. Darren, Jen, and I all took ones with our digital cameras. I wish I&#8217;d brought my larger one &#8212; it can handle the zoom a lot better than my small one.<br />
I was back at the gym bright and early the next morning. I had a very high calorie dinner to try and burn off. I didn&#8217;t get through a lot of it, because I had to be at Pam&#8217;s for 10:30 for brunch. It was the collection of families that had been at the Hovey&#8217;s two nights earlier (see [[It Just Doesn&#8217;t Feel Like Christmas Eve]]), just a different venue. Pam and crew had been preparing breakfast for some time. We mingled until the breakfast bell was rung, and it was time to eat. I have gotta get the recipe for Pam&#8217;s mediterranean breakfast dish. Very tasty.<br />
During breakfast, an idea crept through my little head. It&#8217;s Friday, and I want to go see a matinee. Specifically, &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221;. It dawned on me that Jen had probably not seen it. Sure enough, she hadn&#8217;t. I proposed a plan to relieve Mike and Brenda of their daughter for the afternoon, doing some shopping down at A&amp;B Sound (the two of us had gift certificates to take care of), and then see the movie. All parties were in favour.<br />
A&amp;B Sound was far from packed, but we&#8217;d also long-missed the door crasher specials they&#8217;d had when the doors opened at 7:00 that morning. Fortunately, the discounts on white- and red-tagged prices were still in effect. It also meant we could get through the store without constantly bumping into people, and not spend forever in the checkout line.<br />
Dumping our new-gotten goods in the car, we headed over to Eau Claire Market for the movie. Having a little time before the movie, we endulged in some games in the adjacent arcade. Either Jen was having an off day, or was being merciful. I won all three games of air hockey, a fighting game (Marvel vs. Capcom, if memory serves me right) that I had no idea how to play or what was going on, and a racing game that really wasn&#8217;t that good anyway. Jen still served me my heiny on a platter in Soul Caliber 2, though.<br />
Popcorn and pop in hand, we sat down for the movie. A long one, too. But an interesting one. Not everyone is a fan of Tom Cruise, but he does a very good job in this movie. The short explanation is that it&#8217;s about a civil war veteran who ends up in Japan during the Meiji Reformation to train Japan&#8217;s new army in modern weapons. He&#8217;s captured by the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a group of samurai) and learns about the way of the warrior &#8212; something he&#8217;d lost while fighting in America. Knowing something of Japanese history, it was quite interesting to see, and I wonder how accurate it might really be.<br />
Returning to the Znack&#8217;s, we had leftovers from last night&#8217;s dinner. Just not quite so much. I didn&#8217;t stay too late, though, as I had laundry to tackle &#8212; I&#8217;m running out of clean clothes.<br />
Besides, it gave me a great excuse to watch the movies I got for Christmas.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Tis the night before Christmas,<br />
and all through the house,<br />
the cat is sound sleeping,<br />
as I sit here with my mouse.<br />
No stockings are hung<br />
by a chimney with care,<br />
just thrown in the laundry bin<br />
&#8216;cuz I have more to wear<br />
No children are nestled<br />
all snug in their beds,<br />
The only visions I see<br />
are of oncoming dread.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already noticed, I&#8217;m a little down this Christmas. I mean, it&#8217;s Christmas Eve, and I&#8217;m sitting in front of my computer, wondering what all the hulabaloo is about. When I was a kid &#8212; heck, even two years ago (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]) &#8212; Christmas meant something. It was an occasion. As I sit here in front of my computer, it&#8217;s just a day, no different than any other.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas. Maybe because there was no lead-in, no real build-up. It&#8217;s just &#8220;here&#8221;. Sure, I went to the malls &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t have missed the Christmas decorations if you were Helen Keller. But that&#8217;s not Christmas to me. My mother is here, as is a large portion of my family. Cathy and Craig are back in Oakville, and my Aunt Ruth and cousins Erica and Lauren are in the Toronto area. But is it their presence I miss?<br />
Last year was my first Christmas in Calgary. I have family here &#8212; I didn&#8217;t really miss anything. But is it that? Is that what I am missing? Not just my family here &#8212; but *all* of my family? I don&#8217;t know. Sure, it&#8217;s the second Christmas in a row without Cathy. Without my immediate family. It&#8217;s also the second Christmas without Dad. No loud Christmas music, no massive amounts of decorations, none of the usual triggers one would expect for this season.<br />
At least, none for me. There are plenty of other people looking forward to tomorrow. But not me. It&#8217;s just another day, just one where I don&#8217;t have to work. I think, if anything, I&#8217;m a little depressed. It&#8217;s too easy to lose touch with the things you need or want. It&#8217;s not about possessions &#8212; it&#8217;s about feeling. And maybe this year, I&#8217;m not feeling up to snuff.<br />
Earlier this year, I started dating someone for the first time since arriving in Calgary. While we are no longer together (we are friends), that experience awoke a number of things within me that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. I suppose it&#8217;s wholly possible that some of these feelings are contributing to the problems I&#8217;m having. It could be that I&#8217;m incapable of enjoying Christmas this year because of that.<br />
But admittedly, I don&#8217;t really know. All I do know is that it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas to me. And I can only hope that the feeling is short-lived. I don&#8217;t want to go through the rest of my life feeling like this every December 25th.<br />
But don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t spend my time at home this evening. Tonight, we went out to visit with Aunt Alaine&#8217;s family, who are holding court out in Chestermere, about 20 kms east of Calgary along Hwy 16 (aka Trans Canada Highway). It&#8217;s a short drive, not far from my Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike&#8217;s &#8230; or would be, if we had proper directions.<br />
Getting to Chestermere is easy, don&#8217;t get me wrong. What&#8217;s not so easy? Finding the right house. Why is this so difficult? Because we neglected to get the address, or directions once inside Chestermere before we left the house. This left us circling the endless labyrinth of streets in a vain search for the Hovey residence.<br />
Jen and I got frustrated. While everyone else seemed content to say &#8220;Oh! *This* is the right street!&#8221;, we were content to grab the cell phone, call the house, and announce that we were lost and needed directions. (I was a bit snarky about it, too &#8212; probably a result of the aforementioned frustration.)<br />
Unlike previous excursions to the Hovey&#8217;s (at Easter &#8212; see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]], my family would not be the only ones in attendance. The Tisdales were already in attendance, as were the various relatives on Alaine&#8217;s side of the yard. Several &#8220;kids&#8221; (namely, those a lot younger than I). Luckily, I get along well with the rest of the adults.<br />
We left shortly after 22:00, returning to Calgary. After a brief stop at Brenda and Mike&#8217;s, I drove Mom and Nana to Nana&#8217;s complex, where I swapped the van for my car (left at the complex when we&#8217;d done a run up earlier in the day). In a few short hours, I will be back at Chez Znack for Christmas Day.<br />
Something that, for what seems to be the first time in my life, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, the Greedy Bastard hit Cowtown.<br />
The Bastard in question, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is Eric Idle. For those of you buried under rocks since the day of your birth, Eric was one of Britain&#8217;s Monty Python comedy troupe, makers of several years of quality British television and such movies as &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Life of Brian&#8221;, and &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s The Meaning of Life&#8221;.<br />
Eric is self-described as the sixth most friendly Python, after Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, and John Cleese. For those of you unawares, there are only six members of Monty Python. Having now met the man in person, he certainly is pleasant enough.<br />
Eric is the only current touring (former) member of Monty Python. John has a successful acting career (although Eric&#8217;s is fairly prolific), Michael has done several series for the BBC (a documentary-like version of &#8220;Around the World in 80 Days&#8221;), Terry Gilliam is one of Hollywood&#8217;s more ecclectic directors, and Terry Jones has done some bit parts and a few books (he co-authored &#8220;Starship Titanic&#8221; with &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; author Douglas Adams). Graham Chapman died in 1989.<br />
This time through North America (running October to the end of December), Eric&#8217;s running under the banner: &#8220;The Greedy Ba$tard Tour: Another Stupid Evening&#8230;&#8221;. For all those who think he&#8217;s doing it just for money, he&#8217;ll agree with you 100% of the way. As he started off when he came on stage: &#8220;This is to earn money so I can send my daughter through college &#8230; and my wife through collegen.&#8221;<br />
Tamara, Nick, and I went in a group of three, but weren&#8217;t the only Critical Mass folk out. Steve was there with his girlfriend, as was John with his. I can only assume there were others, but we never saw any of them. It was good to see that the three of us weren&#8217;t the only ones interested in a good laugh.<br />
We arrived at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Theatre (usually referred to as just &#8220;The Jubilee&#8221;) around 19:35, for a 20:00 show. Nick and I are Python fans &#8212; Nick even knows some of the The Rutles (Eric&#8217;s answer to The Beatles). Checking the coats (and stashing the camera), we headed in to find our seats.<br />
I&#8217;d never been to The Jubilee before. It&#8217;s not at all what I expected. It&#8217;s attached to the Alberta College of Art and Design (known more informally as ACAD), but does not look at all like a school auditorium. It&#8217;s a three-tiered honest-to-God theatre, regularly hosting operas and ballets. Tonight, it hosted an &#8220;adults-only&#8221; show. Some of Python&#8217;s material, and some of Eric&#8217;s comedy, is not for kids.<br />
The stage was simple: a small piano on the (audience&#8217;s) left side, and a coat rack, chair, guitar stand, and throw rug on the right. Music played softly as people entered the auditorium. With only minutes to the show, the music became louder, as The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; started playing. Several people in the audience did the motions in the chorus. Then one of the actors (it wasn&#8217;t Eric) walked out on stage as one of the Gumbys &#8212; a Python character known for abject stupidity. He attempted the chorus motions. The audience laughed.<br />
The music changed to the infamous &#8220;Spam&#8221; theme, sung by ancient Vikings. (Yep, another Python skit.) On came Eric, to a cacaphony of whistles, hollers, yells, screams, and a lot of clapping. After the crowd calmed down, he started into his routine, pausing only to introduce something never done before: the Encore Bucket.<br />
This was a shiny, stainless steel garbage can. It&#8217;s Eric&#8217;s way of ensuring that he comes on for an encore. The idea is that you throw money in there (or women&#8217;s underwear &#8212; he&#8217;s trying to break through the Tom Jones Barrier), and if there&#8217;s enough, he&#8217;ll do an encore. In reality, all money collected goes to charity (Eric keeps the underwear). So if you&#8217;re seeing Eric Idle&#8217;s Greedy Bastard Tour, bring a few extra bucks for charity.<br />
The only time he took a truly serious note was to mark that tonight is the second anniversary of George Harrison&#8217;s death. Harrison produced movies, and footed the entire bill for &#8220;Life of Brian&#8221;. As Eric put it: &#8220;The most expensive movie ticket, ever!&#8221; Eric and George had been good friends for many years.<br />
As Eric&#8217;s opening dialogue went on, he explained that he had been to The Jubilee before &#8212; 30 years ago, with the rest of Monty Python, on the first (and last) tour of Canada. Eric has been through Canada a couple of times since (his previous tour was &#8220;Eric Idle Exploits Monty Python&#8221;). On his last tour, he was presented with none other than the Monty Python hook, a very long, crooked pole used to drag people offstage in their skits. The group had left it behind in Vancouver at the end of their tour 30 years ago, and Eric was presented it when he returned a couple of years ago.<br />
As he said: &#8220;I can only imagine what this would fetch on eBay!&#8221;<br />
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical as to the content of the show. I mean, I like Monty Python a lot, but would the show really be anything original? It was just Eric, and there&#8217;s no telling if the rest of the players would have the same comedic timing of Python. I was quite happily relieved to find that Eric&#8217;s happy band of six people (including himself) were quite up to the task. And even after many shows, his co-players can still crack up on stage.<br />
We were treated to many classic Python songs, including &#8220;The Penis Song&#8221;, &#8220;The Philosopher&#8217;s Song&#8221;, &#8220;Sit On My Face&#8221;, &#8220;Eric The Half-A-Bee&#8221;, &#8220;I Like Chinese&#8221;, &#8220;Galaxy Song&#8221;, and of course, the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221;. We hoped for &#8220;Every Sperm Is Sacred&#8221;, but not that night. (Tamara had never heard the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221; before, but had it stuck in her head from the moment she heard it until well after we were home.)<br />
The tickets weren&#8217;t cheap ($55), but it was worth every penny. The show was funny, and even localized. (They rewrote the &#8220;Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge&#8221; skit so that the wife was from Okotoks &#8212; something we found extremely funny, because Tamara&#8217;s from Okotoks.) They included some Canadian humour, including ye olde poke fun at Americans.<br />
Two and a half hours after the show started, it was over. Nick and I ran into the autograph line so we could get things signed. We had hoped for the DVDs we had brought, but a sign read: &#8220;The Greedy Bastard will only sign purchased merchandise&#8221;. Thirty dollars later, I have a signed t-shirt. Hey, I might never get another chance to meet a Python.<br />
I did get a chance to speak to Eric. I thanked him for coming to Calgary, and hoped he would return again. He looked quite tired (the show takes a lot out of you when you&#8217;re 62 years young), but was still the quintessential showman.<br />
Even for a self-proclaimed Bastard.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Friday night was not fun. Erin and I got together after work, headed down to her place to eat pizza and watch Indiana Jones movies. Or at least that was the plan. We watched the second half of &#8220;Last Crusade&#8221; (having started it a couple nights earlier), and had a great time. But as we started to watch &#8220;Temple of Doom&#8221;, things turned a slightly darker note.<br />
We&#8217;d been discussing why I *hate* dancing. (It&#8217;s a long, sordid story that I&#8217;m not going to detail here.) Erin wanted to know why, but I didn&#8217;t want to tell her. She kept at it, repeatedly demanding to know. Suddenly, I found myself blasted four years into the past, and it wasn&#8217;t Erin who was asking me, it was Allison.<br />
All the dread, fear, anguish, and pain that I had thought long gone washed over me like an oil spill washing up on a rocky shore. I felt completely helpless. For almost a half hour, I was unable to do or say anything. Erin was beside herself &#8212; she had no idea what to do. She&#8217;d never seen this sort of thing before, and didn&#8217;t know how to handle it. Not that I could blame her.<br />
It&#8217;s a test. Not an intentional one, I have to say, but it is a test nonetheless. A test of how we deal with problems when they arise, and a test of how I&#8217;m able to adjust having someone else in my life again. Had this happened on my own, I&#8217;d probably have just gone for a walk, watched a movie, played a game, something to dull the mind. But not anymore, now I need to work it through. It&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; I&#8217;ve let these old issues sit far too long.<br />
Saturday got off to a slow start. I didn&#8217;t sleep well at all. I ached all over, and memories of the night before were still far too fresh in my mind. But I looked at the day with fresher eyes &#8212; I wanted to have a good day.<br />
Erin and I met up with her parents and Aunt Edie at Joey Tomato&#8217;s at Chinook a few minutes before noon. Erin&#8217;s father was parading around in shorts, despite the fact that the outside temperature was barely 10 degrees. (Later, I would agree with the choice of attire, since the temperature would rise throughout the day.)<br />
Lunch was excellent, of course, though a little quieter than some of the meals I&#8217;ve had with Erin&#8217;s family. Well, quiet except when Erin&#8217;s dad was prodding me to rib Erin a little bit. Not that it takes much to get me to do it, I&#8217;m nearly convinced Erin&#8217;s dad loves it when I&#8217;m the antagonist.<br />
After lunch, Erin, her mom, and her aunt went shopping. Erin&#8217;s dad and I sauntered across Macleod to the Staples. Erin&#8217;s dad wanted my opinion on a scanner he had put on hold. This was the first time I&#8217;d been left alone with Erin&#8217;s father. It&#8217;s probably the single most nerve-wracking thing for a guy to go through. Erin had already been left alone with my aunt, grandmother, and cousins, so it was only fair (certainly to a point) that I spend some time with just her father, even if under the pretenses of assisting in buying a scanner.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen the Canon LiDE 80 before &#8212; it&#8217;s a new one to me. (Not that I&#8217;ve researched scanners for a while.) But it&#8217;s small, light, powered through the USB port, and comes with a negative scanning adapter (definitely a useful tool). I want one. I haven&#8217;t had a scanner in almost four years, and I have to say, I need one badly. I&#8217;ve got a huge pile of photographs and negatives just calling out to be scanned. I just don&#8217;t have $250 laying around to be used.<br />
Oh well, things to plan for.<br />
Dropping the scanner off in the car, Erin&#8217;s dad and I retreated to Chapters to wait for Erin, her mom, and her aunt. We shared a hot chocolate and cranberry juice, chatted, and waited. Didn&#8217;t take too long before we were all reunited. The reunion was short, as Erin&#8217;s parents and aunt had other things to do.<br />
Erin and I took off to 17th Ave. This is one of Calgary&#8217;s prime shopping areas. It&#8217;s also home to Erin&#8217;s favourite store: I-Appeal. If Erin had the chance, she&#8217;d probably buy everything in the store to decorate her condo. But she had a limit of $20, keeping her to just two &#8220;decorative&#8221; elves. (I think they&#8217;re kinda creepily ugly, personally, but Erin thinks they&#8217;re the bees knees.)<br />
Plans that evening were to attend a long-delayed housewarming for Fritz and Jin. This, of course, means I needed to bring a suitable housewarming gift. For some reason, I&#8217;m a big fan of glass flower vases &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why. As Fritz is a Designer (and certainly Jin is quite stylish), I needed something that would be suitable. Luckily, I-Appeal had just what I was looking for.<br />
After a quick stop at Blockbuster (gift certificates), it was into Reid&#8217;s for some wrapping paper. We then wandered over to 8th St. to stop into Janice Beaton. It had been far too long since my last high-quality cheese fix. I tried to convince Erin that she needed to try some, but it seems there&#8217;s desire for cheese &#8212; and then there&#8217;s me. (I did manage to convince her a little later.) Of course, we had to stop in Bernard Callebaut (it&#8217;s almost impossible to pass it by) for a couple bites. A short stop at the house (to drop off the cheese and wrap the present), and we were off to Fritz and Jin&#8217;s.<br />
Fritz and Jin moved into their condo in July (see [[Painting my house (among other things)]]), after waiting another year following their condo burning down (luckily, they hadn&#8217;t been living there at the time) in a collosal fire. Although housewarmings usually take place not long after moving in, Fritz and Jin had some things they had to attend to, first. So, almost three months later, they finally got to have their party.<br />
Well, the first of a couple, anyway. They&#8217;ve got co-workers and Jin&#8217;s friends to deal with, as well.<br />
Erin and I were the first to arrive. No big surprise there &#8212; our group of friends aren&#8217;t exactly the most punctual kind. It gave us time to chat with Fritz and Jin until the others started to appear. Doug, Jensenne and Jon, Virgil, Jon and Pearl, and Teak and Rose soon rounded out our little group. With the tour of the condo out of the way, we proceeded to scatter about the kitchen/dining/living space and chat.<br />
Some of us hadn&#8217;t seen the others in quite some time. For example, I can&#8217;t really remember the last time I saw Jon and Pearl, but it had been quite a while. It was there that we found out for the first time that they&#8217;re getting engaged &#8212; they just have to wait for the ring. Good news, indeed.<br />
Food was plentiful, if perhaps on the not-quite-so nutritious side &#8212; Asian snack foods. Tasty, but not exactly wholesome. Real food came in the form of pizza, which Fritz and Doug went to pick up.<br />
This group is loosely known as the ABCs &#8212; the Asian Brother Crew. This is Chris&#8217; name for the lot of us. The only missing members were Calvin (MIA, near as we could tell), Chris (still in Japan), Adrian (in Japan, visiting Chris), and Tamara (who, sadly, forgot). As it had been a very long time since the last time together, we marked the occasion with a photograph.<br />
The evening would not end there, however. One thing we particularly like doing is bowl. Yeah, kinda hokey, I know, but it&#8217;s fun. Especially when we&#8217;re making fun of the way we play. So we all raced up to Let&#8217;s Bowl in the Northeast &#8212; our favourite lane. As it was 21:30 when we arrived, we figured on a decent amount of time to play. Or so we thought.<br />
An hour and a half wait. For all the times we&#8217;d been there before, we&#8217;d *never* seen a wait that long. And we weren&#8217;t about to wait. A hurried conversation of where to go next drummed up Pacific Place (formerly known as Franklin Mall), which had bowling lanes. Best part was, it was only a few minutes drive away.<br />
Erin and I initially lost everyone else. They&#8217;d gone around front, where they couldn&#8217;t get into the bowling alley. Erin and I went around back (actually by mistake). A few cell phone calls later, and everyone was assembled to play. Our hopes were initially dashed a wee bit when we realized it was five pin bowling instead of the usual 10-pin. It had been a long time since the last time I&#8217;d bowled five pin (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and I was kind of looking forward to it.<br />
And as it was Erin&#8217;s first time bowling in 14 years, I think she was looking forward to it, too.<br />
I won&#8217;t recount the games &#8212; there&#8217;s no point. Erin did far better than she thought she would (I&#8217;m sure). I bowled okay, though I kept shooting to the left, for some reason. And right after we noticed that the display not only showed the score but also how fast the ball was moving, a few of us tried to get the fastest throw. Fritz won with 43.5 km/h. (I could only do 42.3 km/h.)<br />
The game, and the party, broke up after that. Most of us were tired &#8212; it had been a long day for all. (Especially Teak, who&#8217;d played two back-to-back games of street hockey before coming to the party.)<br />
Can&#8217;t wait until someone else buys a home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s not every day that you turn 30. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s long since been my turn.<br />
This time, it was for my friend Teak. You may remember Teak from a previous birthday of his, when Chris and I felt the need for a little revenge (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). Having no reason to torture my friend, I felt it necessary to show my support for a fellow over-the-hiller.<br />
Teak had reserved the upper floor of Soho, one of the trendier bars in town. Why the upper floor? Teak knows how to throw a party &#8212; he invited 250 people. Now the first rule of parties is to always invite a lot more people than you expect to show up, because about half won&#8217;t come. Teak planned for that, and the upmost floor was ideally suited for 100-130 people.<br />
Tamara, Sheldon (Tamara&#8217;s new boyfriend), and I headed out shortly before 19:30 to rendezvous with the gathering throng at Soho. We were among the first to arrive. Such is the norm, really &#8212; most people seem to like doing what they did in high school, and be fashionably late.<br />
In our haste to leave the house, I realized (much to my chagrin) that I&#8217;d forgotten my camera. I had only recently got it back from Adrian, who had taken it on his whirlwind trip to Japan and the Philippines. I wanted to take photos at Teak&#8217;s birthday &#8212; mostly for Chris, who&#8217;s still trapped in Japan.<br />
Soon, members of the ABC (Asian Brother Crew) started to appear. Fritz and Jin were the first (after Tamara and I), followed soon after by Adrian. Doug appeared not too long after. A few others from Critical Mass (Karen, Mark G., Mark E.) also arrived, as did Arif (arriving with Teak&#8217;s girlfriend Rose), Arthur (with friend Tanya), and former teammate Bonnie (with partner Mandy). We were outnumbered, however, by the rest of Teak&#8217;s friends, a few of whom I vaguely knew.<br />
Tamara and Sheldon didn&#8217;t stay too long before leaving. They didn&#8217;t quite feel like they fit in. (And I did?) I hung out for a while with the ABCs, talked with Bonnie and Mandy for a long time, and then had a long chat with Arthur and Tanya. I couldn&#8217;t stay too long, as my stamina isn&#8217;t quite what it usually is. But without knowing it, I&#8217;d lasted until after midnight.<br />
Arriving home, I flopped on the couch to peruse the late night Saturday television lineup. But once Miao Yin had made herself comfortable in my lap, staying awake just wasn&#8217;t a possibility. I passed out. Explains the kink in my neck.<br />
I&#8217;m getting too old for this.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/" rel="bookmark">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have learned from my jaunt out on Thursday night (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]). I guess I did to a point, but I made one key error: I went out to celebrate Jim&#8217;s birthday.<br />
For the record, Jim&#8217;s a great guy. He&#8217;s a lot of fun &#8212; he has no inhibitions to speak of, he lives more on the edge than most (especially when it comes to skiing), and lives for the moment. He&#8217;s a great web developer, he&#8217;s inquisitive, and is always interested in pushing the boundaries of website development. Unlike most people, Jim doesn&#8217;t really have a shell to come out of &#8212; he wears pretty much all his internal organs on his sleeves.<br />
What&#8217;s all this mean? Well, when you receive an invitation from Jim, asking you to attend an evening of drinking, you can immediately know where it&#8217;ll likely head. The fact that today is Jim&#8217;s 26th birthday made events of last night all the more &#8230; necessary.<br />
I arrived at Jim&#8217;s apartment (a two-minute walk from the venerable Rose &amp; Crown pub) shortly after 20:00, the approximate time we were asked to arrive. Upon entering the apartment to the loud calls of Scott (who&#8217;d arrived mere moments before me), James (already quite well into the bag), and two of Jim&#8217;s friends (whose names I&#8217;m drawing a blank on), I was informed of the house rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No smoking inside. (No worries there.)</li>
<li>No throwing large objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, there were no other rules. But there was a bit of preparation.<br />
As each person arrived, they had to roll dice. For most people, it was three. Women only had to roll two. Mia and Lindsay got away with only one &#8212; Mia was on antibiotics, so was taking a (wisely) careful approach. The number you rolled were the number of drinks you had to have before the night was over. The rules (as stated by Jim) meant that all ones were actually sevens. Thusly, the drink minimum was six, and the maximum was 21. Jim (and Luke, the co-birthday boy) each had to drink 26, because that&#8217;s their new age.<br />
I rolled a 17. Figures. James rolled a 20. He finished even before we left for the Rose &amp; Crown.<br />
To ensure that everyone had their share, you strung the number of candies (taken from a candy necklace) onto a piece of dental floss, which you wore around your necklace. For each drink you finished, you ate one of the candies. Beers and shots counted as one. For pints, it was in groups of three: first pint was a single drink, the next two were two drinks each, for a total of five.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if anyone every really put that rule to the test.<br />
With most of the group assembled around 23:30, we departed for the Rose &amp; Crown (Mia and Lindsay had come and gone by that time). It was cold, but the alcohol kept us (somewhat) warm. Luke bypassed the pub, saying he needed food. He never came back. We kept going at the Rose &amp; Crown, talking drinking, and eating nachos until &#8230; well, until you couldn&#8217;t hang out any longer.<br />
I stopped around 1:30 or so. I was out of money (I had budgeted myself as a limiting device) and feeling kinda tired. I also didn&#8217;t want to relive Friday when I woke up later this morning. So it was off towards home, stopping at Canadian Pizza Unlimited for a little repast, and at the Mac&#8217;s to pick up a litre of Gatorade and a small bag of chips. (Gatorade restores the salts, etc. your body loses while drinking.)<br />
Falling asleep on the couch, I awoke only when Tamara came crashing through the door around 4:00. I don&#8217;t wholly remember her return. I just rolled over and went back to sleep. I haven&#8217;t slept that well in a long time.<br />
Aside from being really tired, I had a much better day than on Friday. Oddly enough, it felt really good to just laze around for a change. It&#8217;s been a while since I outright relaxed. I can only imagine what kind of a day Jim must&#8217;ve had. But something tells me that he wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was not so great &#8212; he almost certainly had a great time last night.<br />
As for me, I think I&#8217;m going to remain sober for a while yet to come. Two nights of debauchery in such close proximity isn&#8217;t good for me. I might begin to like it.<br />
Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t finish the 17. I might have actually had 13 drinks, including shots. Even then, I&#8217;m not too sure. It was probably less &#8212; I cheated a couple of times.</p>

		<blockquote><p>There were green alligators, and long necked geese,<br />
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,<br />
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as your born,<br />
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.<br />
<cite>&#8212; &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;, The Irish Rovers</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>There are all sorts of smart things one can do on a school night. Getting drunk ain&#8217;t one of them.<br />
For those of you no longer in the scholastic world, a &#8220;school night&#8221; is no different than those you experienced at school. Basically, most weekday nights (not counting Friday) and Sunday night. So named because you have to get up early in the morning, file yourself off to a building, and concentrate on things that you might not otherwise like doing.<br />
For the last three days, I&#8217;ve been in all-day meetings. We&#8217;re planning out the 2004 projects for Mercedes-Benz. Now that I&#8217;m part of the lead team, I now participate in these meetings. They&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. We sort out all sorts of issues and really get a good feel for the direction we want to take the account.<br />
But they are draining.<br />
It&#8217;s like having a Martian Brain Sucker attached to your skull all day. By the end of it, you&#8217;re exhausted. The advantage is that you feel really good about the work you&#8217;ve done. All in in all, it&#8217;s a good experience.<br />
&#8216;Course, the best part is the dinner that follow the last day. That&#8217;s when the MB team goes out for dinner. Well, &#8220;dinner&#8221; is a subjective term, since we eat a little and drink a lot. (The amount of drinking varies, usually inversely proportionate to how smart you are about when to stop.) But it&#8217;s all fun.<br />
To make things more interesting, I didn&#8217;t leave right at the end of the day. You see, irony of ironies, the site that I worked on directly (and for which we were having the dinner), MBUSA.com, was down. It had been down since about 11:00 that morning. All because of a database edit. A fairly simple thing, really, which is why we were so utterly puzzled when the &#8220;fix&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.<br />
When 17:00 rolled around, the fixing was still at full speed. I got the skinny on what was going on (I only knew during the day that there was a problem, but not exactly what it was) and tried to understand what part of the problem was. (There was a lot of Java discussion, which I don&#8217;t possess enough of an understanding to truly grasp.) In a nutshell, there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to help.<br />
So I went out to get drunk.<br />
Well, that wasn&#8217;t so much the intention so much as the result. And lest ye be thinking I&#8217;m turning into a raging alcoholic, please rest your fears. Now I know there are a number of stories that always seem to start: &#8220;So we went out to get drunk&#8230;&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I don&#8217;t live my entire week like that &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have made it 31 years if I did. Just that the drinking stories are usually the most fun.<br />
The Wildwood Pub is one of the nicer places in town to meet. It used to be a lot better. Sadly, as I found out last night, their beer quality has begun to sink dramatically. Peter, our newest copywriter, was telling me to avoid the stuff. I should have listened. Between Peter and myself, we tried every variety of beer they had (there&#8217;s only six or seven of &#8217;em). They were all bad. We both switched to Keith&#8217;s.<br />
I think I ended up being the only technology person in attendance. (Most of the others, sadly, were trapped at the office trying to resolve the site problem. The fix, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was to restore a previous backup of the database.) So I guess I felt a responsibility to represent. [Insert cliched reference to LA gangland-style comrades here.]<br />
That might have been what possessed me to drink beer a little too quickly. Either way, a good time was had. So good, in fact, that eventually, it was down to just five people: Dan (the Managing Director &#8212; the Big Kahuna, if you will), Mabel (Dan&#8217;s assistant), Jason (Project Manager), Daryl (Account Manager), and yours truly. That was when Mabel convinced us that we had to go somewhere else.<br />
We retreated to two cars: Mabel&#8217;s and Dan&#8217;s. I rode in Dan&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d never been in a Mercedes-Benz before. (Hey, he *is* the Managing Director. He kind of has to own one.) It&#8217;s nice &#8230; the rear seats are brutally cold, but it is nice. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever own one, though.<br />
Mabel and Dan zig-zagged through Calgary. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I knew where they were going, but we eventually ended up at Mabel&#8217;s apartment, where she ditched her car. The five of us continued in Dan&#8217;s to our destination: Aussie Rules.<br />
Aussie Rules is an Australian bar. (Or at least, it&#8217;s supposed to be.) Now before you think that&#8217;s a little strange, here&#8217;s something else to make you scratch your head: It ain&#8217;t the only one in town. Yes, there is another one: The Flying Emu (okay, so technically, it should be a New Zealand bar), just down from my old apartment.<br />
So you think I&#8217;d see kangaroos, drink Foster&#8217;s, and eat barbecued shrimp, right? Nope. We listened to dueling pianos.<br />
Yes, dueling pianos. Perhaps one of the stranger things to see in a bar. Two pianos (baby grands), facing each other. Two player/singers. But it&#8217;s not a competition &#8212; they play together, banging out whatever songs people request (or whatever they feel like playing). Mabel led us to the table right in front of the stage so we could get the full effect.<br />
We came at an opportune time (which I can only assume was in the vicinity of midnight), as these guys had been playing (and drinking) for a couple of hours. They were definitely well into their silly stage. While they did play great music (they actually did a couple lines out of Gowan&#8217;s &#8220;A Criminal Mind&#8221; on a request I shouted out; they wouldn&#8217;t touch Gordon Lightfoot), they also did a pub favourite. This was Mabel&#8217;s request.<br />
At some point in your life, you&#8217;ve probably heard The Irish Rover&#8217;s &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;. If you listen to it the way the Rovers do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is a very nice song. If you listen to the way the Dueling Pianos do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is an Olympic event.<br />
When the request was made, one of the two pianists (a guy about 40 lbs overweight, I&#8217;d guess) climbed up on top of the piano (I assume it can easily handle the weight of someone on the lid), picked up a microphone, and hopped over to the top of the other piano, and prompted demanded everyone stand up.<br />
Incidentally, I assume they&#8217;ll only do this song after people have been drinking long enough.<br />
So here&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s all about a couple of the verses (here&#8217;s a link, <a href="http://www.irish-rovers.demon.co.uk/lyrics/unicorn.htm">in case you want to know what the lyrics actually are</a>), repeating the chorus often, making the audience mimic the animals mentioned in the chorus, and following the direction of the singer (for example, when he yells: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221;, you point at the bar). If you manage to get to the end with all the motions without laughing yourself to the floor, you&#8217;ve done pretty well.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it. But I didn&#8217;t land on the floor.<br />
Anyway, without going into excrutiating detail (&#8216;cuz you know I could), we had a blast at Aussie Rules. Before we knew it, there was the Last Call. At the time, it didn&#8217;t really click with me what the time probably was. For some reason, I decided that whatever time it was, it wasn&#8217;t really that late. It didn&#8217;t feel that late.<br />
Time flies when you&#8217;re drunk.<br />
We upped and left (paying the bill, of course) and headed towards downtown, dropping Mabel off along the way. Then it was over to the Mercury, another Calgary establishment. I have no idea what time it was when we arrived. It couldn&#8217;t have been too late &#8212; the place was still serving. Dan decided we needed some Irish Whisky to finish off the night.<br />
Dan drove us home. I live somewhat close to Dan, but saved him the trip through Sunnyside by having him drop me off at 2nd Ave and Centre St. From there, it&#8217;s a 20 minute walk home, which I really needed. It gave me enough fresh air to remember to drink a couple glasses of water and take a couple Tylenol to stave off the inevitable hangover.<br />
Tamara had been home barely 30 minutes before I walked in. She laughed. I was a wreck, and she knew it. (Technically, I knew it too, but just wasn&#8217;t willing to acknowledge it.) I had the water, pills, quick run through the bathroom, and crawled into bed somewhere around 3:00.<br />
Well, I assume I crawled into bed. I don&#8217;t really remember that step, but since I woke up in there, that&#8217;s about as close an assumption as I can make. My alarm &#8212; Chris&#8217; stereo which clicks on at 5:20 playing the Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; album (the entire thing &#8212; that&#8217;s over 45 minutes long) &#8212; didn&#8217;t wake me up. Not even remotely. I forgot to set my secondary alarm. Luckily, I have a backup.<br />
It&#8217;s furry, has four feet, and purrs. She also meows really loudly in the morning when she wants to be fed.<br />
At 7:37, I bolted out of bed in a bit of a panic, threw my head under the tap to get the bedhead down, dressed, shaved very quickly, ran a toothbrush across my teeth, and was in the process of about to run out the door when I realized Tamara was still asleep. We carpooled. I don&#8217;t drive to work usually, but considering we had to be at work for 8:00, I made an exception.<br />
The hangover kicked in around 8:30. And it got progressively worse all morning. The more I moved, the worse it got. Fortunately, nothing so serious that I was ready to &#8230; well, y&#8217;know, but I sucked back a few aspirin with ginger ale to try quieten the body. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a greasy lunch at A&amp;W that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Well, as normal as anyone can feel after mimicking a chimpanzee in a Australian bar in suburban Calgary at some ungodly hour of the night because I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for my own good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. And it&#8217;s not even Hallowe&#8217;en yet.<br />
Starting early this week, the weather folk started telling us to prepare for Calgary&#8217;s first snowstorm of the season. This is something we&#8217;ve heard a couple of times before &#8212; some of you might have heard about this &#8220;big dump&#8221; we were supposed to get back in September (we had, at most, a light dusting).<br />
This time, though, they weren&#8217;t wrong. Tuesday, it started raining. And the temperature fell all day. By 20:00, it was snowing. Only colder things (e.g. cars and benches) were gathering an accumulation. Everywhere else it was melting away. I walked home from downtown &#8212; by the time I got there, it was clear that this wasn&#8217;t going to be a simple dusting.<br />
The temperature dropped overnight, and the snow fell harder. By morning, there was at least four inches of snow on my front walk. I debated for a moment on either shovelling before the gym, or dealing with the aftermath when I got home. I chose the latter, mostly because I wanted to get to the gym, and my snow shovel was in the garage.<br />
Before I left, I realized that I would not be able to wear my shoes outside. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve worn running shoes &#8212; the same ones I would wear to work any other given day. Sounds a little chilly, I know, but because I&#8217;m always moving, it&#8217;s never been a problem. But my current choice of footwear was definitely not suited to winter weather.<br />
Thus, I hauled out my pair of winter boots. They had not seen outdoors in over six years. The last time I&#8217;d worn them was when I worked in downtown Toronto. I had to don a second pair of socks (wool ones), as the rubbing of the leather would probably wreak havoc on my poor feet. These boots have massive grip &#8230; on anything that&#8217;s not ice (as I found out this morning when my heel got a little too far ahead of me, and I found myself sitting in the middle of Centre Street).<br />
None of the roads had been ploughed, and only one short segment of the sidewalks in my area had been shovelled (the guy gets up even earlier than I do). Memorial Drive was a mess, as the night time traffic wasn&#8217;t frequent enough to clear the road. Fortunately, the city Peanut Pusher had cleaned off part of the pathway, giving me an easier walk to the Prince&#8217;s Island Park footbridge. The bridge was a little difficult, and the snow was still deep on the other side. I was a couple minutes late getting to the gym.<br />
The snow was still falling heavily when I left the gym over an hour later. The walk to work wasn&#8217;t easy. Although more sidewalks were now clear, they were also quite slippery. (Most hadn&#8217;t put down any salt.) I was about five minutes late getting to work.<br />
Some people were almost two hours late. And people wonder why I live in the inner city&#8230;<br />
It snowed most of the day. It was still snowing when I went home and shovelled the snow from my walkway and sidewalk. (On the bright side, the thick layer of snow obscures the scar where the sewer was replaced &#8212; see 24 September 2003.)<br />
The snow had stopped by this morning. But it was -12 when I left the house for the gym. Minus 12. It&#8217;s not even November yet. The windchill was double that. So say that this is not exactly expected (or desired) is to put it mildly.<br />
And, of course, tomorrow is Hallowe&#8217;en. The forecast is for at least -7, if not colder. You won&#8217;t be seeing any ballerinas, elves, or fairies tomorrow night. This years&#8217; hot costume in Calgary? Inuit.<br />
Snow is forecast for a few days yet to come. We won&#8217;t see above-zero temperatures for at least a week, by the looks of it. This is definitely one of the weirdest autumns I&#8217;ve yet experienced.<br />
I&#8217;m not ready to go walking in a mid-fall (hence, not-quite-winter) wonderland.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I love seeing old friends. I just hate seeing them leave.<br />
Therese was in town this weekend. Not really to visit with people so much (though that was one thing she did), but to defend her dissertation &#8212; the last step in obtaining her PhD. It&#8217;s the end of a very long road for Therese, something she&#8217;s been working hard to complete for over a third of her life.<br />
The defence was on Thursday afternoon. I had vowed to leave her be until then, since I knew that she&#8217;d be in preparations until then. We ended up talking for a while Wednesday afternoon &#8212; Therese called me while she took a little break. I&#8217;m not sure if she called so much for a social conversation, or looking for affirmation. As Therese would explain to me, graduate students often have low self-worth, having been told time and time again their work isn&#8217;t good enough. Luckily, it didn&#8217;t take much to instill faith in her knowledge and wisdom.<br />
Either that, or she was gullible enough to believe me.<br />
Therese&#8217;s defence began at 14:00 Thursday afternoon. Exactly what happened in there, I will never know. (Not that it&#8217;s really any of my business, anyway.) The defence was supposed to last about two hours, after which, Therese would receive her final grade. It&#8217;s a three-point score. If you get a &#8216;1&#8217;, you get champagne. If you get a &#8216;2&#8217;, you get a congratulations. If you don&#8217;t get either, you get to do it over again. Therese would find out around 16:30 what that score was. Ideally, that&#8217;s when I would find out if I had to start calling her &#8220;Doc&#8221;.<br />
16:00 came and went without any news. I called around 16:45, in hopes of catching her before something happened (we were supposed to get together that evening). I ended up at home around 17:45 without so much as a peep. I called again, and caught Therese in the midst of something very loud. I didn&#8217;t ask if she passed. I didn&#8217;t have to. I knew.<br />
&#8220;So, can I call you &#8216;Doc&#8217; now?&#8221;<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present the new Dr. Therese Hollingsworth. (Feels kinda weird to be writing that, I have to say.)<br />
The plan was to meet at Catch at 19:15 (the first time they had a table for five) and celebrate. (Besides, Therese had $50 in gift certificates to spend.) Therese drove over with her friend Joe, Geoff and Deanna would meet us there later. When I arrived, I found Therese alone at the table. It had only been a month and a half since I&#8217;d last seen her, but it felt like a lifetime.<br />
What made it more poignant was that this was a different Therese. This wasn&#8217;t the Therese I had come to know over the last decade. This Therese was happy, relaxed, and for the first time in her life, free of school. And just to complicate things even more (as if finishing her doctorate, moving to Montreal, and buying a home weren&#8217;t enough), Therese is three months&#8217; pregnant. In a few short months, two of my best and closest friends will be parents.<br />
I suddenly feel about 10 years older. (That&#8217;s 28 for those of you keeping count.) I&#8217;m not ready for this level of maturity. I&#8217;m too young for this.<br />
We ate a wonderful dinner and celebrated Therese&#8217;s success. The conversation around dinner naturally stemmed towards Therese&#8217;s pregnancy, sprinkled every so often with the defence and how it had gone and what Therese was going to do with her post-doctorate in Montreal. Life, it seems, rarely stays in place.<br />
I drove Therese to Stefanie&#8217;s that night, where Therese would stay until she leaves for Montreal this afternoon. But this wasn&#8217;t goodbye yet &#8212; there was still much to do. And Friday night would be such an event.<br />
Geoff (I should point out that I&#8217;m not talking about myself in the third person &#8212; this is *another* Geoff) booked the private room at the Blind Monk for Therese&#8217;s &#8220;reception&#8221;. So, after work, Erin and I headed down (after making a quick pit stop at Bernard Callebaut &#8212; Stuart had asked me to pick up some chocolates for Therese), where Therese got to meet Erin for the first time.<br />
The evening was long &#8212; running from about 19:00 to just after midnight. For us, it was tiring. For Therese, it was a marathon. Being on Eastern time, still exhausted from the defence, and pregnancy don&#8217;t really help one&#8217;s stamina. But Therese was among the last to leave.<br />
The next day, later in the afternoon, I picked up Geoff and Therese from the university to go shopping at Chinook. Therese and Geoff were going to visit Jeanine, Dory, and their new baby in Innisfail the next day, and weren&#8217;t about to go up empty-handed. Baby clothes and toys were the order of the day. I even threw in a small blanket with a bunny head sewn in the middle. (It sounds rather morbid, but it is cute.)<br />
Geoff left early, as Therese and I finished shopping. First to Willow Park for wine &#8212; a thank you gift for Therese&#8217;s advisors. Then it was to PetSmart to obtain a gift for Stefanie and Ian, who had put Therese up for a few days. Then it was the long drive back to Stefanie&#8217;s (not counting a side trip for a quick snack). Therese and I talked the whole way. I knew this would be the last time I&#8217;d see Therese for a while.<br />
Leaving her was difficult. I didn&#8217;t see Therese (or Stuart, for that matter) as much as I would have liked while she lived in Calgary. Now she&#8217;s 3,000 kilometres away, and three months&#8217; pregnant. I&#8217;ll not be seeing her again until after her child is born. We both found it hard to left go. Luckily, the dark streets were empty as I drove down the street. I could barely see the road through the tears.<br />
My weekend did not end there, though. Sunday brought around another first for Erin &#8212; not only had she met one of my closest friends (she had met Stuart when he had come out a month ago to ship out the contents of their house), but now she was going to meet my family.<br />
Well, &#8220;clan&#8221;, I guess. Since Mom, Cathy, and Craig live back in Ontario, Erin won&#8217;t meet them until Christmas (or so). But this was a chance for her to meet my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, cousins Jen, Pam, and Darren, Sean (Pam&#8217;s boyfriend), and of course, Nana.<br />
Needless to say, Erin was a little nervous.<br />
Actually, even *I* was a little nervous. I mean, they&#8217;re my family and I love them to death, but it&#8217;s hard to know how things will go. It&#8217;s not that I planned on disaster or anything (I wouldn&#8217;t have brought Erin if I didn&#8217;t think things would go well), but you never really know how well things will go until they happen. Besides, strange things always seem to happen when we go over there for dinner.<br />
Example: Mike announced that he had to pack up three bags of crabs for a co-worker. This suddenly conjured images of three large bags of Snow or Alaskan King, making me wonder what bet Mike had lost. I wasn&#8217;t the only one with this thought, and we soon found out that he had meant crabapples, not seafood. A co-worker wanted to make crabapple jelly. This led Mike, Jen, Sean, Darren, and I outside and quite literally up a tree.<br />
Sadly, many of the apples were going soft (some were outright rotten), but there were still many to be had. The tricky part, though, is getting them off the tree. Rotten apples are a breeze &#8212; just shake the branch. The good ones have a much stronger grip, and have to be picked by hand. Darren climbed a latter. Mike hopped on the fence. I went up the tree itself. (And have all the scratches to prove it.) It must&#8217;ve been quite the sight to see all of us in the denuded tree. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find out when Brenda gets her photos developed.<br />
Dinner, as expected, was outstanding. The food was excellent, and the conversation well matched the repast. But dinner was cut a little short. It seemed Darren and Sean were harbouring a virus, which showed through soon after the meal was complete &#8212; they were fading fast. Dinner was over by 20:00. A little unusual for my family, but not unwelcome &#8212; it gave us plenty of time to drive Nana home, me to drop of Erin (who lives in the deep south of Calgary), and be home in time to get my butt up for gym in the morning.<br />
I now sit, staring out my window, half wishing I could see planes taking off from the airport. I&#8217;d wave to them, knowing eventually Therese&#8217;s plane would be passing over. Instead, I have to wave at the crackheads and hookers who love hanging out in our area.<br />
Have a safe flight, dear friend. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be too long &#8217;til when next we meet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In years previous, I&#8217;ve spent Thanksgiving with my family. This year, however, I spent it with Erin&#8217;s.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t a spur-of-the-moment thing. In fact, this was loosely planned from the last (and first) time I&#8217;d met Erin&#8217;s parents (see [[Meeting the parents]]). The idea had arisen during the dinner, when (thorough engaged in conversation, not at all affected by the wine we were drinking or by the comradery Erin&#8217;s dad and I felt as we took on Erin in a battle of wits) Erin&#8217;s father had suggested that next time we might stay the night and not have to worry about what we ate or drank.<br />
Thanksgiving was just the next logical opportunity. And with my family out of town, there seemed no reason not to go.<br />
Not there wasn&#8217;t any possible apprehension. Let&#8217;s be realistic here &#8212; I&#8217;m spending over 24 hours with my girlfriend&#8217;s parents (in their home). I&#8217;ve met them from before, so in that respect there&#8217;s no pressure, but this is a slightly different aspect. In my last serious relationship, I spent the night on my first visit. But I slept in a separate bed. Erin and I were destined for the same room, same bed. At times, I almost worry that there&#8217;s *too* much acceptance. If that actually makes any sense&#8230;<br />
We headed out from Calgary late Sunday morning. I love long weekends &#8212; Sundays never seem sad because you don&#8217;t have to go to work the next day. I think I&#8217;ve always disliked Sunday for that reason. (I&#8217;ve never minded long weekend Mondays, though.) The day was cool, but bright, and the trip down to Nanton was fairly speedy &#8230; except for that stretch of Highway 2 just north of High River being repaved.<br />
Dinner preparation was already well underway. The turkey was due to hit the barbecue (yes, not the oven &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how well it works) at 13:00. As Erin and were running a little late, the original plans for lunch had to be altered. While Erin&#8217;s dad stuck around to ensure that the turkey hit the heat on time, Erin, Erin&#8217;s mom, and I went on a little trip to retrieve sustenance.<br />
Nanton&#8217;s a small town. Erin&#8217;s parents live a block away from the &#8220;downtown&#8221; core. (If you drive south from Calgary on Highway 2, you&#8217;ll pass right through downtown Nanton.) You can walk around the downtown in about 20 minutes, I think. About half of the stores are antique shops, there&#8217;s a couple of restaurants, a pub or two, a CIBC, one hotel (near as I can tell, anyway), and a few grain elevators.<br />
Nanton, once upon a time, was a (fairly) major station on CP&#8217;s MacLeod subdivision, when it ran from High River down to Ft. MacLeod. (Assumedly for lack of profitability, the subdivision was closed and the tracks ripped up south of High River between 1998 and 1999.) Today, the rail bed is still very visible, and the grain elevators sit forlorn, no longer in active (rail) use.<br />
Whether or not the disappearance of the railroad has led to Nanton&#8217;s shrinking commercial base (there are a number of closed businesses) is a debatable one. The loss of the railroad has affected other towns in the past (Hanna, Biggar, Melville, Stratford), and some manage to recover through various efforts (such as the Stratford Festival). Nanton, however, seems quite content to be as it is.<br />
The three of us wandered across a somewhat chilly downtown to a small restaurant on Highway 2 north (the highway divides running through Nanton), sitting between the road and the rail bed. While the name of the place completely escapes me, it&#8217;s the only (open) restaurant on that side of the road. There you&#8217;ll find all sorts of homemade-type foods. And without a doubt, possibly the best sandwich I&#8217;ve ever had. (Mind you, the uber-fresh, all-natural bread from a little bakery in High River contributed to that.)<br />
After some discussion, Erin and I went for a walk around town. Specifically, I wanted to see all the antique shops. I think Nanton&#8217;s second-largest industry after agriculture is antiques &#8212; there&#8217;s more stores in two blocks than in most of Calgary, I think. And the prices are actually pretty reasonable (well, except for one place). Most of the items are quite interesting, too, and you don&#8217;t have to spend huge amounts of time filtering through things.<br />
One store in particular is massive. Once upon a time, it was a hardware store on the main level, with apartments in the second floor. Now the entire building is nothing but antiques. Name it &#8212; it&#8217;s probably in there, somewhere. Once upon a time, so I&#8217;m told, the store owners had things laid out very carefully. The apartments were laid out as &#8220;suites&#8221;, with entire collections made out so you could (in theory) buy an entire suite at once. The original owners sold and moved on, and now things are just stacked to the ceiling.<br />
There was only one shop we didn&#8217;t make it into before closing time. But by then, Erin and I didn&#8217;t really care too much &#8212; the whine of Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; fridge and the musty smell of the antiques gave the both of us headaches. We retreated to Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; home to do something about the pain.<br />
Dinner was the traditional fare for Thanksgiving: turkey, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and buns. For most of the day, I managed to keep myself clear of food preparation. But as Erin was mashing potatoes, I felt the urge to suddenly interject.<br />
I have issues with mashed potatoes. I hate them. Well, to be specific, I hate plain mashed potatoes. They&#8217;re boring. They have no flavour, and almost no texture. It bothers me immensely. So when I saw Erin&#8217;s mom bringing out the milk, I suggested a slight modification to the dish: Beer.<br />
Yeah, I know, beer&#8217;s my solution for everything. In this case, it partly is. You want to make really good mashed potatoes? Here&#8217;s what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-6 medium-sized red skin potatoes</li>
<li>1 medium-sized white (or yellow) onion</li>
<li>2-5 cloves of garlic (depending on how strong you like)</li>
<li>1 can Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown (or beer of choice)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>dried or fresh rosemary</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean, but do not peel, the potatoes (there&#8217;s a lot of flavour in the skin). Cook as you would normally, until ready to mash. While cooking the potatoes, chop the onion and put into a frying pan on medium-low heat. Cover the frying pan with a lid, uncovering only occasionally to stir (you don&#8217;t want anything to burn). This will caramelize the onions. When you&#8217;re ready to start mashing the potatoes, chop and add the garlic to the onions. Mash the potatoes with a hand masher &#8212; it&#8217;s more work, but the texture is better than with a blender. Pour in only as much beer as you need to mash the potatoes. You can go for thick and chunky or &#8220;creamy&#8221;, depending on what you like (I find that just enough beer to take most of the large lumps out is perfect). Add the onion/garlic mixture, sprinkle some rosemary, and mash some more.<br />
Everyone seemed to like them. (Well, why wouldn&#8217;t they?)<br />
I also dabbled in making the gravy, when Erin&#8217;s mom tried to back out of making it by saying there weren&#8217;t enough drippings. (Small children could have swam with all the drippings we had.) I was more than happy to dive in and &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem.<br />
The turkey was completely free-range organic. The farm it came from (Sunworks Farm in Armena, AB) is so eco-friendly that its pamphlet even advertises that it&#8217;s &#8220;predator-friendly&#8221;. It&#8217;s more expensive, to be sure, but I have to say &#8212; you can taste what turkey is *supposed* to taste like. This is a farm I&#8217;m definitely going to have to look into much closer in the future.<br />
Oh. I have to mention the cranberry sauce. (I can hear the &#8220;oohs&#8221; from Cathy and Mom.) I&#8217;ve never liked cranberry sauce. Felt it was just not the sort of thing I would eat with turkey. Well, Erin&#8217;s mom pulled a recipe for &#8220;Gourmet Cranberry Sauce&#8221; from one of the bazillion &#8220;Best of Bridge&#8221; cookbooks. It&#8217;s essentially cranberries (fresh or frozen), oranges, and Gran Marnier. Screw the turkey &#8212; that stuff you can eat on its own.<br />
Even though we were quite full from the first round, we had to partake of dessert &#8212; pumpkin pie. As we briefly congregated in the kitchen to carry out the dessert, Erin&#8217;s mom suddenly thrust a small crystal bowl mostly filled with a transparent green substance.<br />
Lime Jell-o.<br />
Now, there are probably a few people in my family who will laugh at this. The rest of you are probably confused beyond all heck.<br />
What&#8217;s the deal with the lime Jell-o? This stems back to the last time I was in Nanton. I&#8217;d told Erin&#8217;s parents about Christmas (and other family dinners) at my father&#8217;s mother&#8217;s home in Leaside (Toronto). At the time, I&#8217;d hated all the other desserts: pies, some cakes, trifle, etc. So Grandma had always make bowls of Jell-o for me, which I sometimes had to fight over with others.<br />
Erin&#8217;s mom had remembered, and made me a bowl of Jell-o. Erin was thorough confused, apparently having forgotten that conversation. Heck, even *I* hadn&#8217;t realized why Erin&#8217;s mom had made it at first, until I remembered the stories I&#8217;d told the last time I was there.<br />
Needless to say, I like Erin&#8217;s parents.<br />
We had a late harvest Riesling with dessert. By that point, my stomach was crying &#8220;uncle&#8221;, and I spent about 45 minutes trying to put myself in a semi-comfortable position as not to feel too ill. Turkey coma kicked in about an hour later, and I ended up crawling into bed shortly after midnight.<br />
The next morning, it was my turn to cook. (I&#8217;d made this request from when it was suggested that I was coming to Nanton.) I&#8217;d been wanting to make my dad&#8217;s pancakes for years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t had them since Christmas of 2001, and was dying to have them again. So, with Erin&#8217;s family watching, I whipped up a batch of pancake batter, fried up some sausages (Erin&#8217;s mom made some really good bacon), and julienned a couple potatoes for hash browns.<br />
My poor stomach hadn&#8217;t recovered from dinner the night before.<br />
The sausages were thoroughly delightful, not the least of which was because they (like the turkey) were all-natural. Instead of fillers or sweeteners, there were cranberries. I&#8217;m certain the casings weren&#8217;t edible plastic, either.<br />
Having completely ruined my diet for about a month, Erin and I set up to head back to Calgary. Both of us had things to do, and while sticking around was a good thought, we readied to roll. But not without trucking back enough food for a small battalion.<br />
I love leftovers. Especially when it&#8217;s turkey.</p>

		<p>This weekend, I visited southern Ontario. Even though I&#8217;ve only just left, it almost feels like I was never even there.<br />
A few weeks back, Critical Mass announced (to the employees) that it was in the process of pitching a very large client (see [[Friends: Visiting and moving away]]). And no, I still can&#8217;t tell you who it is.<br />
Anyway, at the time, there was the great expectation that I&#8217;d be coming out to Toronto to help interview people and (ultimately) help set up the team in the Toronto office &#8212; assuming that we won the work.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass is growing. We&#8217;re preparing for a (hoped) massive expansion, but also have organic growth to contend with.<br />
This is what led Critical Mass to have to hire a new Project Analyst. And luckily for me, it&#8217;s my friend Graham.<br />
You might remember Graham from a couple train chases, specifically my last hunt of 6060 (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]) and from the Inaugural Run of the CPR Empress (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It&#8217;s because of Graham&#8217;s ex-girlfriend that I met Graham while chasing 2816, because I looked a little lost. Since them, Graham and I have forged an interesting friendship, based mostly around trains.<br />
This means, of course, that I&#8217;m no longer the only train guy in the office. And some people here already know this. When Graham came for his first interview, Claude asked him about his hobbies, which included (of course) chasing trains. They asked if Graham knew me.<br />
Now this is where I got screwed. You see, Graham didn&#8217;t apply for this job because of me. I didn&#8217;t even know about it. Graham applied knowing that I work for Critical Mass. Because he wanted to get in on his own merit, he feined ignorance of me. If I&#8217;d had the chance to recommend him (and I would have), I could have received a $1,000 referral bonus.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Either way, it&#8217;s all good. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see Graham more than I have in the past (which isn&#8217;t that much), but with him on the fourth floor and me on the second, it&#8217;s hard to say how much our paths will cross.<br />
And we have to be a little cautious. If both of us ever called in sick at once, the immediate assumption would be that we&#8217;re chasing trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I did the one thing that most guys dread when they get into a relationship.<br />
I met the parents.<br />
This was something Erin and I had discussed several times over the last week or so. It sounds like a huge deal, I&#8217;m sure. It means I&#8217;m getting serious &#8212; why would I meet her parents otherwise, right?<br />
Things aren&#8217;t quite *that* serious. In fact, the primary reason I&#8217;m meeting her parents isn&#8217;t because I need to start calling them &#8220;Mom and Dad&#8221;, but because they&#8217;re an important part of Erin&#8217;s life. She sees them almost every weekend, and talks to them almost every day. It&#8217;s the same as introducing Erin to Scott when he was in town.<br />
So, with that in mind, we took off from Calgary late this morning for Nanton, a small town about 45 minutes south of the city. It&#8217;s an easy drive &#8212; Highway 2 runs right through the middle of town, and Erin and I rarely stop talking.<br />
Erin was trying to psyche me out. Although this was important to her, she was trying to have as much fun with it as possible. But despite trying as hard as she could, Erin was more nervous about me meeting her parents than I was. (Of course, it helps to have gone through this before, but on a bigger scale &#8212; see [[Visiting Friends in Calgary, Deciding to Leave Vancouver]].)<br />
Erin&#8217;s parents met us at the door. I presented Erin&#8217;s mom with a bouquet of flowers in thanks for hosting us for the day. (My mother drilled into me the need to make sure that I don&#8217;t show up empty-handed.) Erin&#8217;s dad was quick with a handshake. Within minutes, I had a &#8220;slush&#8221; in hand &#8212; basically, a home-made bellini. (If you don&#8217;t know what a bellini is, just think of it as an alcoholic Slurpee.)<br />
Now this is when you&#8217;d expect 20 Questions. In fact, we ended up starting down a path quite humourous. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Make Fun of Erin&#8221;.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; this is risky business. This is the sort of thing that gets me in big trouble with the significant other. For the record, I didn&#8217;t start this &#8212; Erin&#8217;s dad did. Erin and her father have an odd relationship of constantly badgering each other. I just jumped on the bandwagon when I had the opportunity to get a couple of jabs in. I caught a few &#8220;oooooh, you&#8217;ll get yours&#8221; glares from Erin, but haven&#8217;t (as of yet) received anything in return.<br />
Erin&#8217;s an only child, so is close to her parents. But make no mistakes, Erin is not the spoiled brat one might expect. Erin&#8217;s upbringing was controlled (which led Erin&#8217;s mother at one point to declare &#8220;there&#8217;s only one thing we didn&#8217;t let you do&#8221;, which of course took on the wrong connotation and nearly left me in convulsions). Erin doesn&#8217;t get away with much, especially with her father on her case. (I just tagged along for the ride.)<br />
We had loosely planned to visit for a while and then go look at all the antique stores in Nanton. But soon we were into the Las Vegas photo albums, and Erin&#8217;s dad hauled out their rather impressive collection of Canadian Mint coins. Before we knew it, it was dinner time.<br />
Beef tenderloin, cabbage salad (from which the mushrooms were withheld because someone had told Erin&#8217;s parents that mushrooms and I don&#8217;t get along), cheese bread, baked potatoes, and beans. Far more than I&#8217;d ever expected, and all delicious. We talked almost the entire dinner.<br />
And did I mention the bundt cake? Erin&#8217;s mom made a cake based on her aunt&#8217;s recipe. It comes with a white chocolate glaze that just about sent my blood sugar count through the ceiling. And worth every vibrated tooth.<br />
But before long, it was just past 20:00, and we had to head back to the city. It&#8217;s a 45 minute drive to Erin&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s another 20-30 minutes to my house. I need to make sure I hit the gym tomorrow to try and work some of the dinner off.<br />
We&#8217;ll be back. I&#8217;ve been invited for Thanksgiving. The question is who&#8217;ll be the bigger turkey: me, or the bird.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just when you think it&#8217;s safe not to worry about having to put out any additional funds for home improvement, the proverbial crap hits the fan.<br />
Or in this case, the sewer line.<br />
For the record, it wasn&#8217;t *my* sewer line. It&#8217;s my neighbours&#8217;. As you might recall from a previous note about my house (see [[Strange Things that Happen while Buying a House]]), the house next door to mine is a mirror image. They were built at the same time, using the same (but reversed) floor plan, and similar construction. In fact, when built, the houses were so similar they even put in the sewer lines at the same time, a scant six inches from each other as they go out to the road.<br />
Yes, you are correct: &#8220;Uh oh&#8221;.<br />
Now to really get things into perspective, you need to understand two things: 1) The sewer lines are original, meaning they were put in place 91 years ago, using materials common to construction 91 years ago. 2) There were a number of trees planted and removed over the last 91 years.<br />
What&#8217;s this mean? Allow me to explain&#8230;<br />
About three weeks ago, I sat on my couch (okay, I was sprawled all over it&#8230;) watching either TV or a movie (can&#8217;t remember which). I noticed a City of Calgary Waterworks Emergency truck pull up in front on my home. The passenger shone his flashlight at the street numbers, hard to see in the late evening light. I became worried when they stopped in front of my home. I suddenly was worried that there was something up with my sewer that I didn&#8217;t know about.<br />
They went to my neighbours&#8217; place. They came back the next day, followed soon after by Roto-Rooter. Finally talking to Neil, I got the scoop: a section of their sewer line, outside of City property (hence, responsibility) was so blocked that Roto-Rooter couldn&#8217;t get through it with their gizmos. Near as the technicians could figure, the pipe had collapsed.<br />
What had caused the pipe to collapse? Well, we&#8217;re not entirely sure about that, but we&#8217;re pretty certain it was the aforementioned trees. Whether it was that blasted poplar that&#8217;s been wreaking havoc, or it was the tree that (until recently) sat above the pipes is anyone&#8217;s guess. But age combined with root taps had done in the wonder of the modern age, and it was time for it to be replaced.<br />
This meant digging. This is when I find out that our two sewer lines are a scant six inches apart, right in the same area as our water lines.<br />
Oh yeah, I was just *loving* this.<br />
I&#8217;m not about to be the kind of assoholic neighbour that&#8217;ll stand up and say: &#8220;Sure, you want to replace the sewer? Go nuts. You can pay for mine while you&#8217;re at it.&#8221; Why? Well, aside knowing that I was likely in the same boat, there&#8217;s a neat little book floating around that has a good piece of advice in it: Love thy neighbour. (I might not be a religious person, but books of faith often have some good common-sense thoughts in them.)<br />
So last Wednesday, bolted home to get started on the dirty work. The lines ran underneath a section of grass shared by the two properties, divided by a fence and a tree. Because this section would be completely dug out, the fence had to go, and the tree had to come down. By the time I got home, Neil and Daryl were already at work.<br />
The front fence at Neil and Daryl&#8217;s place had to come down completely. The section of fence from the property line to my front gate had to come out (thankfully, not the rest). And, of course, the fence down the property line. Above the ground, the fence looked pretty good. But as we dug it out, we realized that the people who&#8217;d put it there had not used treated wood. A few more years, and it would have had to have been replaced, anyway.<br />
The tree was the fun part. None of us had power tools suited to the job. All we did have were handsaws and a length of rope. (The rope was tied off to branches to keep the houses from being hit.) At first, the job was pretty easy. But as we started getting to the larger branches, it became a much harder problem. We sawed and hacked (with a hatchet) through thick branches, and then would all get on the end of the rope to try and pull the branch down.<br />
Across the road, the superintendant of one of the apartment buildings had been watching our progress. He sauntered (slowly) across the road to see how we were doing.<br />
Him: So. (Pause) Looks like you&#8217;re cutting down a tree.<br />
Us: Really? We thought we were putting up a monument to Che Guevara&#8230;<br />
Him: You&#8217;re going about it the wrong way.<br />
Us: Actually, we felt we needed to get back to our Amish roots.<br />
Him: Let me go get you my chainsaw.<br />
Us: You kind, generous, thoughtful man! We are forever in your debt!<br />
So the superintendant sauntered (slowly) back across the road, returning (slowly) with his electric chainsaw. After giving Neil a demonstration of how to use it, we set down to the task of cutting down (and chopping up) the remainder of the tree. Neil and Daryl hauled off the remains to &#8230; well, somewhere, but I never did find out.<br />
Yesterday, the digging started. Roto-Rooter brought in a backhoe, and began the task of uncovering the pipes. Neil was there at the beginning to oversee the work (though he ended up staying the entire day), and called me with updates as things happened.<br />
Teak and I had planned to get together for lunch, but I ended up having to ask him to drive me home so I could see what was going on. The trench was unreal &#8212; roots sprouted out everywhere. It was amazing the sewer pipes were intact at all.<br />
They&#8217;d dug all the way back between the houses. (We&#8217;ll have to replace the concrete pathways next spring.) Neil and Daryl&#8217;s cast-iron house pipe was exposed, but my pipe was still clay. The houses might be identical, but things were definitely not equal under the surface. (An additional five feet of digging still didn&#8217;t find the pipe, but they did find an excellent quality clay pipe to use for a connection.)<br />
While my sewer line hadn&#8217;t yet collapsed, it was just a matter of time. Roots had grown in a tight mass inside my line, and had actually started to grow up the pipes into the house. Before connecting the new sewer pipe (something called &#8220;Schedule 40&#8221; PVC), Roto-Rooter cleaned out all the roots they could. (We did a flush test when Tamara got home, to make sure water was flowing freely.)<br />
By the time I got home, just after 20:40, the work was done. The pipes were in place, the dirt filled back in. It was far from perfect &#8212; the torn-up ground was nothing to look at, and the walkways were a disaster. I&#8217;m actually hoping it snows soon so I don&#8217;t have to look at it. Looks like I&#8217;ve already got some home improvement projects set up for next year&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s another cost I hadn&#8217;t planned (or expected). It&#8217;s another one of those joys of owning a home. (The next owner is gonna have it soooo easy.) On the bright side, it&#8217;s something else I won&#8217;t have to worry about.<br />
As the saying goes, shit happens. But now, it&#8217;ll flow a lot more freely.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in early August, I learned the awful truth that Therese and Stuart were moving to Montreal, ne&#8217;er to return. (Okay, that&#8217;s an assumption. They might, but I ain&#8217;t holding my breath.)<br />
Needless to say, I suddenly ran into the problem of living in the big city of Calgary without any close friends. (Okay, that&#8217;s an exaggeration. I do have a fabulous roommate &#8212; say &#8220;hi&#8221;, Tamara!) Faced with a prolonged period of time (mostly) alone, I felt I needed something a little more.<br />
Now, my experience in this city has been one of dichotomy. While it appears to be full of young, single people, none of them appear to be women and even fewer seem to be interested in me. Given, I wasn&#8217;t trolling bars or clubs. That&#8217;s because the pickings in those places is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that when you&#8217;re looking for Dom Perignon, y&#8217;ain&#8217;t about to settle for Baby Duck.<br />
This is what led me to (drum roll, please) the Internet.<br />
You: And here I thought you were going to say &#8220;train station&#8221;.<br />
Me: Ha ha&#8230;<br />
You: Though I suppose we shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised about the Internet, either.<br />
Me: Remember who you&#8217;re talking to.<br />
As was once quoted in the movie &#8220;American Pie&#8221;, God bless the Internet. You can find *anything* there. I mean it &#8212; look long enough, and you&#8217;ll eventually come across something that pretty much fits exactly what you need.<br />
This is how I found Erin.<br />
A couple years ago, I&#8217;d heard of a site called &#8220;Lavalife&#8221;. It&#8217;s a pseudo-dating site. I say &#8220;pseudo&#8221; because the site itself does nothing to set you up with anyone else. It&#8217;s solely for providing a place for people find each other. It&#8217;s up to the individual to contact someone else. What happens from there is up to you and your ability not to come across as a schmuck.<br />
And yes, somehow, I managed to do just that. (Or Erin is kind enough to overlook and not mention it.)<br />
We met online, under aliases, and exchanged email. (It shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising as a result that email constitutes the majority of our communication.) That led to online chatting (through MSN) and eventually to the (*gasp*) phone number exchange. It was still a while after that before we actually met for the first time.<br />
This is the great thing about using the Internet for dating, particularly on dating sites such as Lavalife: quality. (Okay, not entirely true. Erin&#8217;s told me a few horror stories of some of the guys she met online.) Generally-speaking, people who come to Lavalife have a similar goal: to meet someone else. You&#8217;re not dealing with pounding music, a smoky room, or people so fake that it&#8217;s actually painful. There&#8217;s no commitment, and there&#8217;s no requirement. It&#8217;s just you, a keyboard, and a digital photo of yourself (technically optional, but you&#8217;ll want one anyway).<br />
Somehow, all that managed to get me introduced to Erin, though I honestly can&#8217;t remember who made first contact. (Not that it really matters now.)<br />
So, what do you want to know about Erin? Well, she&#8217;s a little younger than I (if you think I&#8217;m giving out age, you&#8217;re definitely mistaken), a little shorter than me (which is not a big deal), but is big on conversation, movies, having a good time, and above all, getting to know people. We clicked on the first date, which either says a lot for me, or for Erin&#8217;s ability to see past all that freakishness that seems to scare everyone else away.<br />
One of the weirdest things, which we learned very early on in one of our phone calls, is that we work barely over a block from each other. Were it not for the Ribtor building, we&#8217;d probably be able to see each other&#8217;s workplace. Unfortunately, despite proximity, having mutual lunches is exceedingly difficult due to Erin&#8217;s schedule. Perhaps one day&#8230;<br />
So you could say that I have a new girlfriend. Well, sorta, anyway. For now, we&#8217;re sticking to just &#8220;seeing each other&#8221;. It&#8217;s not for a want of using something more definite, but just because we don&#8217;t want to rush things too much (we&#8217;re still firmly in &#8220;Discovery&#8221; mode). But I see no reason why I wouldn&#8217;t be calling Erin my girlfriend before too long.<br />
And this time, she&#8217;s not a 637,540 pound steam locomotive. (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]] for an explanation of that little joke.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is nothing harder in life than saying goodbye to a loved one. This evening, I had to make the hardest choice of my life. This evening, I had to put my beloved Siamese cat to sleep. A year and a half and one day ago, my father passed away. Tonight, Spaz goes to join him, together again. They were inseparable while Dad was alive. It seems only fitting that they are now reunited.<br />
It is particularly hard to accept this, especially coming after yesterday&#8217;s high, remembering the first anniversary of the CBC 50th Anniversary Train. To come from a high to a low in such a period certainly does not help one&#8217;s happiness quotia. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for one night, in a vain attempt to kill the pain.<br />
Spaz was born in either 1989 or 1991, depending on who you ask. I believe it is the former, but her medical records suggest the latter. She was a gift from my Aunt Ruth to my grandmother, who named her Yum-Yum, after one of the characters in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;Mikado&#8221;. My grandmother wasn&#8217;t one for names, though, and soon was calling her &#8220;Puss&#8221;, as she had every other cat. I was the only one who called her &#8220;Spaz&#8221;, referring to her spastic behaviour as a kitten.<br />
Over the years, Spaz became an absolutely personable cat. She would immediately warm up to whomever was in the room, usually beelining for the person most allergic to her. She rarely bit anyone, and if she did it was because they weren&#8217;t giving her enough seafood. After Grandma moved into a retirement apartment, Dad took in Spaz, where they became fast friends. Spaz saw much of North America travelling with my parents. When Dad died last year, I took Spaz into my home, as Mom has never really been a huge fan of pets. Spaz and I enjoyed over a year together, sleeping in the same bed, often under the same covers.<br />
(I should note that when I spoke with Mom earlier this evening, she was almost as upset as I was. Mom might have not been a big fan of pets, but Spaz was such a great cat that she grew on everyone around her.)<br />
Over the last two months, I saw a change in Spaz, though I wasn&#8217;t fully willing to accept it. Mom was the one to finally bring it to light when she was out visiting. Spaz was underweight. She was not as responsive as in her glory. I think I refused to believe that perhaps the end was in sight.<br />
Yesterday, as Tamara and I returned from a matinee, I found Spaz coughing in a way I&#8217;d never seen her before, and spitting up material I&#8217;d never seen. Fearing the worst, I immediately took her to the Calgary North Animal Hospital (on a recommendation from Scott and Tara, whose cats have visited probably more times than they care to wish). Spaz was immediately admitted and almost immediately transferred to an oxygen tent. Blue at admitting, she was soon able to breathe.<br />
I waited in Exam Room 1 for the doctor, reading the poster for anatomy on ferrets. Outside, I could hear a boy, no more than five years old, crying desperately to his mother about never seeing his pet again. Inside, I felt like that five year old. Somehow, I knew that Spaz would never be coming home again.<br />
Over the next 18 hours, Spaz was checked, prodded, poked, and tested. At about 16:45, I received a call from Dr. Henderson, who began to explain to me the seriousness of Spaz&#8217;s condition. Although she didn&#8217;t say it outright, I knew what she was telling me. Spaz&#8217;s life was at an end, and there was likely little veterinary science could do to save her. I had known Spaz for almost half my life, and while I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her go, I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her suffer for my own selfish needs.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what exactly Spaz was suffering from, neither did Dr. Henderson. But suffering, she was. Blood tests were inconclusive, but Dr. Henderson was confident that the problems weren&#8217;t from asthma, which Spaz had dealt with for many years. This was far more serious. My conversation with the vet only seemed to conclude that tests would only show what would ultimately kill Spaz, not what could cure her.<br />
It was raining when Tamara and I drove up to the hospital. Spaz was in an incubator &#8212; the kind used for premature babies. She was warm, as I&#8217;d always hoped she&#8217;d be at the end. But she was unresponsive. She seemed to only vaguely know that we were there. There was no purring. Although she was lying upright (not on her side), she didn&#8217;t really respond the way she had less than two days before.<br />
We left the hospital, passing by the front clerk. She asked if we were sure that we didn&#8217;t want to be there with her. I barely choked out a &#8220;no, thanks&#8221; as we passed by. I nearly lost control twice on my way out the door. I couldn&#8217;t be there, although it broke my heart not to be with her at the end.<br />
It helped having Tamara with me as we drove home. Without her, I would not have been able to focus on the road. I was numb. When Dad passed away, I was saddened, but knew that his end was coming. Spaz&#8217;s death I was not prepared for, though I knew that by bringing her to Alberta, I might have only extended her life by a year. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for it.<br />
The best part about driving in the rain is that no-one can see you crying.<br />
Farewell, dear Spaz. May you, Dad, and Grandma be reunited again.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that it&#8217;s only been a year since the day the CBC Television 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train departed Vancouver on its epic 33-day trip across Canada. It seems like it&#8217;s been a lot longer.<br />
I suppose part of that is because I live in Calgary, isolated from nearly everyone else on the trip. (Enza&#8217;s very close to me, living in Banff, but I don&#8217;t have the luxury of working in the same building, as most of the Toronto folk do.) I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to see a couple of people &#8212; Angela and Tracy when they stopped through on a documentary tour (see [[CBC documentaries at the Glenbow Museum]]), and Julie and Enza when Julie came out on a conference (we met in Banff). Beyond that, the only contact I&#8217;ve had is through email.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate saying goodbye to close friends. Early this morning, Therese and Stuart boarded their WestJet flight with a trunkful of luggage and two cats. They&#8217;re moving to Montreal. By about this time, they&#8217;re over Ontario, about an hour from landing in Ottawa.<br />
For the last three and a half years, I&#8217;ve had the luxury of living in a city with three of my closest friends. Chris lived with me for two of those years. But Chris moved to Japan, and while we do keep regular communication through email and ICQ, it&#8217;s just not the same as having him here. I didn&#8217;t see Stuart and Therese nearly as much as I would have liked, but having them in the same city was just somehow comforting.<br />
Now I feel almost alone. I have friends here, yes, but none like them. None with whom I have a great history. None where even just a simple hug can convey more words than a 100-page treatise on friendship. They&#8217;re more family than friend. I&#8217;ll see them again, of that there is no doubt, but it won&#8217;t be for at least a couple of weeks. (Both need to come back over the next two months, Stuart to get their belongings moved, and Therese for her dissertation.) After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess.<br />
On Saturday, I went to a small get-together for Stuart and Therese at Stephanie&#8217;s home. (Stephanie is Therese&#8217;s classmate and friend.) There were only about 10 people in attendance. I know them all, but hadn&#8217;t seen some in well over a year. We talked, ate, and played with Pepper, Stephanie and Ian&#8217;s Westhighland Terrier. Yet despite all the laughter and good humour, there was an underlying tension. Two people were leaving.<br />
I spent most of Sunday cleaning up around the house. I haven&#8217;t cleaned much this summer, owing to a busy schedule. Things are almost back to normal. It was a way for me to kill time until Therese and Stuart called. I had offered to take them out to dinner, but as with every major move I&#8217;ve ever seen, packing was still going on right until they called me at about 18:30, to help clean out Therese&#8217;s office.<br />
I felt strangely in the way as I helped move boxes of papers and books into the Jetta and the Mini. (If you think a Mini is small, just see what you can pack in one!) It took a couple of hours, but we made off with everything inside. Stuart and I would return later, having accidentally forgotten a poster in the computer lab (which led to a fairly tense time trying to remember the door code) and needing to drop off a guitar and a glass vase.<br />
Dropping Stuart off, I drove off into the night, with a single thought in my mind:<br />
Movement is life. Be it physical or existential, it is nonetheless important and necessary. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are moving from one city to the next, or from one state of mind to the next, just so long as you move. You will only feel true pain if you stop moving.<br />
Good luck, and best hopes and wishes, my friends! Never stop moving.</p>

		<p>Last weekend was the first weekend in a while where a) I wasn&#8217;t busy with work or family, and b) wasn&#8217;t trying to paint the house. (No, I&#8217;m not done painting. I&#8217;m just sick of it.) So I opted to relax a little bit.<br />
It was raining when I awoke Saturday. This is something we&#8217;ve been dying to happen for a while now, if for nothing else than to hopefully take some of the smoke out of the air. We&#8217;ve been plagued by smoke from forest fires in the Crowsnest Pass for days now, and it&#8217;s long since past that point where campfire smoke actually smells good. So began my lazy Saturday. It felt sooooo good.<br />
I spent most of the day watching TV and movies, and fidding around with my computer. (It was cool enough that I could have the computer on for long periods without fear of overheating.) In the late afternoon, Stuart called to see what I was up to. Having no specific plans (outside of expecting my friend Greg to appear at some point during the day), we loosely planned for a movie that evening.<br />
We then talked about Stuart and Therese&#8217;s big move. Therese has accepted a post-doctorate at the University of Montreal. This led Stuart to fly out to Montreal and find a new job. Which took about 20 seconds. Stuart has far too much talent and experience for his own good, it seems, and pretty much could walk into almost any agency and get snapped up right away. A better job, a better town, and a lot more than I&#8217;m being paid. [Insert sound of swallowed pride here.]<br />
But it means they have to move at the beginning of September. Although I don&#8217;t get to see Therese and Stuart as much as I&#8217;d like, I&#8217;m about to see them even less. I haven&#8217;t seen some of my friends in well over five years. It won&#8217;t be easy having them half-way across the country.<br />
However, I might end up following them out. Critical Mass is currently engaged in the single largest pitch we&#8217;ve ever engaged in. The potential is massive, and could totally change the way Critical Mass operates. It&#8217;s exciting and terrifying at the same time, and no-one here really knows what will happen if we do win the work. (We&#8217;ve got stiff competition, so we honestly don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;ll fare.)<br />
One thing we do know is that we&#8217;ll have to reopen the Toronto office, for a variety of reasons. First, it&#8217;s closer to the client than Calgary. Second, we&#8217;ll have an easier time finding suitable people in the Toronto market &#8212; we&#8217;ve pretty much depleted Calgary&#8217;s. Third, we&#8217;ll need to keep the team separate from the one in Calgary, partly because we don&#8217;t want conflict with existing teams.<br />
The obvious question you know have is: Am I moving to Toronto? Maybe. And that&#8217;s about the best answer I can currently offer. I knew about this plan weeks ago when we were working on the pitch document (see 5 August 2003), and my name was on the list for the Toronto office. This is for a number of reasons, but mostly because Di (who&#8217;s leading this project) knows that when the going gets tough, I don&#8217;t leave the office.<br />
There&#8217;s another reason other than my workaholism. I&#8217;ve been personally unable to choose between staying here in Calgary or going to Toronto. I&#8217;ve done the southern Ontario thing, so that in itself isn&#8217;t a draw for me. But the opportunities that might present themselves might be work the risk (if there is in fact any risk). So I decided that I needed the company&#8217;s opinion on where they wanted me most. Since Monday, I&#8217;ve heard answers all across the board, and no clear direction. They definitely ain&#8217;t making this easy for me.<br />
That other reason? When I talked with Cory, he mentioned that we&#8217;re going to have a hard time getting our team up to speed as quickly as possible. He wanted to see someone with experience that he could throw to the wolves and know that they&#8217;d have them tamed in due course. Jude and Colin have either not expressed an interest to go, or have said flat out that they don&#8217;t want to go. That leaves me as the only other Web Development Manager. And since my name is on the list already, that&#8217;s just an added benefit.<br />
Cory doesn&#8217;t want to see me go there for two years, though (the desired contracted time for anyone transferring to Toronto). Frankly, neither do I. Somehow, I&#8217;ve become oddly useful to a number of people and projects here, which is why I was having problems decide. (Allard, my boss, had expressed his opinion that I should stay.) Cory and I are already thinking that a shorter term, say six months, might be more appropriate. Sort of like the infamous Dilbert Bungee Boss.<br />
We found out today that the client is delaying their decision a month, so the earliest I&#8217;d be going is late October. (Although I will be in Toronto Sept. 18-20 for a job fair to find candidates for the job. Anyone interested in a job at Critical Mass?) There&#8217;s no guarantees of anything, so we&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.<br />
I spent most of the weekend thinking about how to handle this decision, and most of this week trying to figure out what the company wants. (But given the sheer chaos going on around here this week &#8212; several other clients have asked for the world by next week &#8212; I can totally understand getting mixed messages.)<br />
Back to Saturday, though. Greg eventually did call, having arrived in Calgary later than planned owing to heavier traffic than expected and far too many people at the McDonald&#8217;s and Tim Horton&#8217;s along the way. I felt pretty bad, because we&#8217;d loosely planned to do something when he got there, but with Stuart and Therese leaving, I wanted to see them as much as possible. (I didn&#8217;t get to see Therese that night, since she had to continue writing her PhD dissertation.) Greg, it seemed, was pretty keen on seeing a movie.<br />
Stuart, Greg, and I shared a pre-movie beverage at Eau Claire before heading in. The movie (S.W.A.T.) wasn&#8217;t exactly Oscar material, but I&#8217;ve seen worse this year. Stuart headed out after the movie, leaving Greg and I to continue our chat at the Barley Mill. It&#8217;s been a long time since Greg and I last had a good talk &#8212; in fact, it was almost a year ago (see 1 September 2002).<br />
The following morning was my first run with dim sum in about two months. Scheduling&#8217;s been a pain, and my weekends have been so busy that it just hasn&#8217;t been possible. But this could have been my last with Stuart and Therese, so I wanted to make the most of it.<br />
Greg and I hooked up later that afternoon, and opted for a drive out of town. (Mostly because Greg wanted to see what the Mini was like.) After grabbing coffee (for Greg) at Tim Horton&#8217;s, we headed west out to Bragg Creek, and then down to Elbow Falls. I had kind of expected it to be like the last time I was there (see 3 July 2001, Part 1) &#8212; a few people, and quiet. Instead, the entire area was full of people picnicing and jumping off the cliffs into the splash pool below.<br />
We wandered around a bit, discussing jobs, politics, cars, families, girlfriends (well, his anyway), and pretty much anything else that came to mind. Then it was back to the road. But this time, Greg drove. Greg wanted to see what a Mini was like on the road, and I trust Greg implicitly. (Although he does drive a little faster than I do&#8230;)<br />
As we bombed down Highway 22 towards Calgary, something floated into Greg&#8217;s head: Fubar. No, not that he was about to total my car, but the movie. (It&#8217;s an independant cult-level movie filmed in Alberta. It&#8217;s on Greg&#8217;s &#8220;Top 10 Movies That Changed My Life&#8221; list, next to &#8220;Scarface&#8221;.) Part of the movie takes place in a little town called High River. When I told Greg it was maybe 50 kms south of Calgary, he nearly lost control of the car:<br />
Greg: (Excitedly) [Censored] it! We&#8217;re goin&#8217;! (More calmly) Uh, do you mind?<br />
Me: (Not really caring, or fully understanding the desire.) Uh, okay&#8230;<br />
Greg: (Excitedly) [Censored] it! We&#8217;re goin&#8217;!<br />
Before long, we were in High River, searching for a building with a mural of buffalo being chased off a cliff. (Don&#8217;t ask. If you haven&#8217;t seen the movie, it doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense. I know because I haven&#8217;t seen the movie, either.) Greg was beside himself when we finally found it (didn&#8217;t take long &#8212; High River&#8217;s not that big). One day I will finally understand was the excitement was all about.<br />
Buying what I can only constitute as a &#8220;ceremonial&#8221; cube of Pilsner (a &#8220;cube&#8221; is the Albertan equivalent of an Ontario 2-4), we returned to Calgary and a late dinner, with what I can only describe as the best roast beef I think I&#8217;ve ever had. My father would have loved it.<br />
We parted ways later that night, not having run out of conversation topics or energy, but time. I had work the following day (I missed going to the gym due to lack of energy and sleep) and Greg had to drive to Edmonton the following day.<br />
I went to bed that night with many things floating around in my mind, most of them about what I would do without old friends. Makes me wonder what the next few weeks are going to bring.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite the plethora of forest fires plaguing the B.C. interior, my family decided it was a good weekend to dive into the (mostly) green forests of Banff National Park.<br />
Now you&#8217;re probably wondering why on Earth I noted forest fires in B.C. when Banff National Park is clearly in Alberta. Simply put: smoke travels. Calgary has had many hazy days as a result of all the fires, and my eyes have itched a fair amount due to airborne particulates. As we left the city, you couldn&#8217;t see the Rockies in the distance. It will be like this until the forest fires end.<br />
I started off my morning slapping another coat of paint around the windows. I came inside to prepare for the excursion only to find Miao-Yin had decided to lay waste to my couch with the former contents of her stomach. After vigourously repressing the urge to use her as a furry soccer ball (I banned her to the basement for the next 24 hours instead), I cleaned up the mess, then cleaned myself and gathered my photography equipment, finishing just as my family arrived to pick me up.<br />
Uncle Mike drove with Nana riding shotgun. I sat behind Mike; Mom behind Nana. Aunt Brenda, Maggie, and Jen took up the rear of the minivan. With the A/C on full blast (or so it felt), we took off for the trip into the mountains.<br />
Our first stop (not counting the raid of Robin&#8217;s Donuts to get a snack for the ride out) was at the Three Sisters Mountain Village. This is a new development project up the mountain slopes on the south-eastern edge of Canmore. This is a massive project &#8212; the Three Sisters bought up 1,800 acres of land, and portioned them out into lots for fairly expensive homes (condos starting at $250,000 and homes starting at around $400,000) to homes starting at 4,500 square feet (I don&#8217;t want to know the price). Naturally, the area is pockmarked with golf courses.<br />
The development is mostly to cater to those who want to live the Banff lifestyle, but can&#8217;t move into Banff (which has a limitation on development). While Canmore doesn&#8217;t lie within the boundaries of Banff National Park, the city council seems to have kept the general ideas in place. Canmore has yet to acquire a real &#8220;mall&#8221; of any kind.<br />
Sighing off the prices that none of us can (or will ever) afford, we proceeded to Banff. Or more specifically, to the line-up for Banff. Despite the haze brought on by forest fire smoke, a large number of Albertans and tourists alike were gathered at the park entrance to acquire their day passes. So naturally, we ended up in the slowest line.<br />
Mike and Brenda decided to renew their annual pass, and made quick work of the purchase. About a half hour after entering the line, we were pulling off for the Minnewanka Loop. The Minnewanka Loop is a road on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway, across from Banff Townsite. The road is a several-kilometre loop up to Lake Minnewanka, across the retention dam, and eventually back around to the road you went up in the first place. It&#8217;s a nice ride, albeit curvy.<br />
Our first stop was at Lake Minnewanka, where we took a few moments to make use of facilities and take a look around. It&#8217;s a gorgeous little area &#8212; you can even take power and sailboats up there for a cruise around the lake. It&#8217;s a fairly large lake, too, so there&#8217;s a lot to see on water that you would have some trouble getting to on land.<br />
Some of the surrounding hills showed sign of forest fire. To keep Banff National Park (and other surrounding areas), conservationists started controlled fires to burn out some of the material most likely to burn. It&#8217;s a little unsightly, but helps with the forest life cycle and promotes new, healthy growth.<br />
One thing that&#8217;s been discovered in recent years is that, despite the obvious damage, forest fires are a necessary part of life in the forest. New growth can&#8217;t start in old growth forests. Although environmentalists cry out at the thought of burning an old forest (can&#8217;t say I blame &#8217;em, either), the canopies are often too dense to let light in to spur new trees. When the forests burn, the canopies are destroyed and nutrients (in the form of ash) are returned to the soil. Though it takes a few years, the resulting forest is just as strong and healthy as the previous one.<br />
As an additional note: logging does not appear to have the same benefits as burning.<br />
Anyway, we didn&#8217;t stick around too long at Minnewanka, as there was a severe lack of picnic tables. So we decided to head on down to Johnson Lake, in hopes of something there. The road was mostly empty, save for the odd car. Normally, the area would be full of campers. An influx of grizzly bears has put a stop to that for now.<br />
Johnson Lake was slowly beginning to fill up. We arrived early enough, however, to acquire a picnic table in the shade. Considering that it was quite warm outside, this was a definite benefit &#8230; the breeze that blew in off the lake also helped.<br />
The portable propane barbecue was set up (open fires are pretty much verboten throughout Western Canada at the moment) and lunch started while Jen and I went for a little wander around the area. The next time I go back, I&#8217;ll have to make sure to wear shoes (I was wearing sandals) and return when all the trails are reopened (closed either for safety reasons, specifically bears, or for environmental protection).<br />
The six of us sat under the trees, fending off the odd bee and trying to keep Maggie from barking at everyone or eating out of our hands. Aside from the nigh-indestructable table, the experience was pretty much prototypical picnic.<br />
Following our lunch (the table was open for all of 10 seconds before another family swooped in on it), we headed out for Banff Townsite. Like the picnic area we had just left, Banff (Bamf!) was full of people and cars. (Although we managed to get a parking spot on Banff Ave.) Such was to begin our afternoon of shopping.<br />
There&#8217;s only one thing that will truly keep me from shopping: other people. And I&#8217;m not referring to too many other people &#8212; shopping in crowded malls (especially during Christmas) has always been a fun thing to do. The problem wasn&#8217;t mine, so much as it was Nana&#8217;s and Mom&#8217;s. They&#8217;re not exactly the Andretti brothers when it comes to walking down crowded sidewalks. And with the heat, Mom&#8217;s mobility wasn&#8217;t exactly stellar.<br />
Much to Jen&#8217;s dismay, we made it only down one side of the street before calling off the shopping spree. Nana was the only purchaser. We had debated on going to the Banff Springs for a drink on the patio. Then it was the Rose and Crown in Canmore, as there would be far less tourists there. But as we approached Canmore, we decided it was better to have drinks in Calgary.<br />
I fell asleep on the way home. I guess I&#8217;d had too much mountain air for one day. (And I had woken early to tackle some house painting.) I snapped out of my slumber at the Calgary city limits.<br />
That night, my family feasted on Thai from the King and I. What amazed me, at first anyway, was that Mom was keen on trying it. But somehow, it hadn&#8217;t registered with her that &#8220;Thai&#8221; was Asian. And Mom&#8217;s not a big fan of Asian foods. She did eat some of it, though.<br />
That was my Saturday. I can sum up Sunday in one word: Painting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The weekend past was the August long weekend. Well, it was the long weekend for most people. For me, it was one of three things: painting the house, spending time with family, or being at work.<br />
Four things, if you count sleeping.<br />
Mom arrived in town Wednesday afternoon. Her arrival was what had fuelled my desire to paint the house. The idea was to have the whole thing painted in time for her arrival. Yeah, my ambition&#8217;s pretty sizeable. I figure: Go big, or go home. I might have made it, had it not been for a couple of work-related things that came up and threw me off-target for time.<br />
Wednesday night I spent with Mom, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jen. Thursday night was here at the office, dealing with project work. For the first time since I started doing overtime at Critical Mass (on my second day on the job &#8212; see [[My First Entry from Critical Mass]]), I wasn&#8217;t programming. I was doing the things I used to do before I came to Critical Mass: document editing and formatting (and a little writing and editing).<br />
What was I working on? We&#8217;re doing the single largest pitch in the history of Critical Mass. And I can&#8217;t tell you who it&#8217;s for, so don&#8217;t ask. All I can tell you is that if we do win it, the contract will fundamentally change Critical Mass. It&#8217;s that big.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Aren&#8217;t I Mercedes-Benz Boy? I&#8217;m still working on our single largest account, no worries about that. But it&#8217;s been a slow year for us, and I had the opportunity to contribute. I also offered to assist with the document construction.<br />
Why did I do that? Well, for those of you who know what I used to do, it&#8217;s probably a bit of a surprise. For those of you who don&#8217;t, allow me to tell you why I&#8217;m a web developer. After graduating university, I became a Technical Writer (something I&#8217;d started doing on co-op work terms). I did technical writing for six years in total. Towards the end, I hated it so much I sometimes felt like a coyote caught in a trap, and wanted to gnaw my own hands off.<br />
While at Radical Entertainment, I started pushing myself more towards web development. I&#8217;d already been doing it for a number of years, so it wasn&#8217;t that big a stretch. Owing to a need to leave Vancouver, I came here. Based on a recommendation from my friend Scott, I applied at Critical Mass and the rest is history. But what isn&#8217;t commonly known is that while I was waiting for word from Critical Mass about my position, I was actively avoiding several technical writing positions.<br />
That&#8217;s how much this pitch means to Critical Mass. That&#8217;s how much I was driven to go back to doing what I used to do. That&#8217;s how I ended up in the office on Thursday night, most of Saturday, and all of Monday (8:00 to well after 22:00).<br />
That&#8217;s how I remembered how much I hate Microsoft Word.<br />
Friday night was the first of what will likely be many family dinners while Mom is out visiting. (Not that I&#8217;m complaining in any way.) But it was Saturday that was the big event &#8212; the birthday party for my Aunt Brenda. I won&#8217;t tell you how old she is, but it&#8217;s the one that causes people to put 50 pink flamingos on your front lawn.<br />
It was supposed to be a surprise party. It was supposed to be a grand little affair where we get her to scream in delight, etc. But I seem the only living person in my family able to organize these things without the guests of honour finding out. Aunt Brenda almost planned her entire party. Were it not for me being a royal pain-the-ass, she would have spent a good portion of it in the kitchen preparing food. I started banning her from the kitchen.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t easy, either. Aunt Brenda&#8217;s kitchen is a magnet for her. Every time I turned my back, she was back in there. I actually uttered: &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me come in there!&#8221;<br />
She did.<br />
I ended up finally kicking her out and handling the things she would have done, like making the best darn corn bread on the planet. It&#8217;s a heart attack in a pan, but it&#8217;s worth the potential coronary. I have *got* to get that recipe one of these days.<br />
The next day, I woke up a little early (for a weekend) to resume painting. It&#8217;s finally cooled off a bit, and it allowed me to tackle painting the front of the house &#8212; the only side I wanted to do before Mom saw the house. (I still have to do the west wall, but you can&#8217;t see it unless you&#8217;re in my neighbour&#8217;s yard.) I even got several of the windows finished up.<br />
Painting a house can be a bit of a Zen thing. (&#8220;Zen and the Art of Decorative Trim&#8221;?) I&#8217;ve had several people tell me that it might be great to have tunes blaring while slapping down a coat of paint. I have yet to have a radio turned on. And when I&#8217;m using the paint sprayer, I can&#8217;t hear anything else.<br />
House painting, in some ways, returns you to your youth. Especially when you use latex paints. It doesn&#8217;t stick to glass, plastic, or skin. It makes you feel like that creepy kid in second grade who put Elmer&#8217;s Glue all over their hands so they could peel it off like a layer of skin. It&#8217;s especially fun in the shower. Doesn&#8217;t matter how dried the paint is &#8212; a little warm water and soap, and *poof* there&#8217;s a clump of sloughed-off paint skin on the shower floor.<br />
Mom, Aunt Brenda, and Jen appeared around 14:00. Mom was being dropped off while the other two checked out &#8220;Johnny English&#8221;. Mom, Tamara and I chatted in the backyard for a while, listening to some jerk across the alley scream his head off at another tenant about unpaid bills and broken windows. It was an argument I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in listening to, but had little choice.<br />
Mom half-guilted me into cleaning up the yard a bit while we sat out back. Mostly cutting back all the suckers growing from two trees and the lilac bush. Admittedly, though, it did look better. Then it was back to painting.<br />
As Sunday was Aunt Brenda&#8217;s actual birthday, we all went out for dinner at a nice homey Italian restaurant along 17th Ave., Buon Giorno. Definitely not the swankiest restaurant in Calgary, but they make a good meal. Try the scallops &#8212; their chef cooks them to absolute perfection.<br />
My cell phone rang at 7:33 Monday morning. It was Chicago. Although I&#8217;d been on call all weekend, this was *the* call I&#8217;d been expecting. I was in the office 10 minutes later and editing. I had hoped to paint that morning. No matter. The worst that would happen was I&#8217;d be editing until 16:00, at which time the documents were off to Kinko&#8217;s for copying.<br />
Or at least that&#8217;s what I thought.<br />
The morning was sheer chaos and panic, especially when I saw the state of the appendix. It would take a phone call with Heather to put my mind at ease, especially when I realized that not everything in the appendix was supposed to be formatted.<br />
More problems with Word trying to do things I didn&#8217;t want it to do. These are problems that Microsoft has never removed. And before you go saying: &#8220;Must be a problem with the user&#8221;, when I first detected them with Word 97, I stumped the tech support guys in Redmond, WA who were unable to solve the problem. You&#8217;d think after six years, they&#8217;d fix the damn thing.<br />
Final call came sometime after 22:00 last night. I was tired. I hadn&#8217;t felt that tired as a result of office work in a very long time. But the pitch is off to the hopeful client-to-be. Now we just have to wait a half a month to find out if they want to take us to the second round or not. I hope there&#8217;s not as much pressure as the first round.<br />
My idea of pressure on the second round is the kind sealed by bottle cap.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I need a weekend from my weekend. &#8216;Course, it&#8217;s my fault for trying to do so much at once.<br />
For the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been preparing to paint my house. (The outside, that is.) I should have painted it last year, as my home inspector suggested (see [[Meeting with the Home Inspector]]), but I had a few things that kinda got in the way ([[Moving into my New (Old) House|moving into the house]], [[My Housewarming Party|my housewarming party]], [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding|a wedding]], and the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC 50th Anniversary train</a>). By the time I could have done it, the weather was too cold.<br />
Once the roof was reshingled (an expensive but necessary repair), I set down to start painting. I didn&#8217;t have to strip all the paint off, but I did have to remove paint from around the windows and the front door. Most of it had disintegrated and really needed to be replaced. The rest I can paint over.<br />
Weather and a few too many activities last week delayed my start, which I pegged as Saturday. However, I had forgotten about one little detail: I&#8217;d already promised to help my friends Fritz and Jin move into their new condo.<br />
This, I might add, I was more than happy to do. Fritz had helped me move last year ([[Moving into my New (Old) House]]), so this was my turn. Luckily, Fritz didn&#8217;t have anything truly awkward (except maybe the futon), so it was just a matter of hauling things around. There were five of us actually moving things: Fritz, Doug, Adrian, Godfrey, and myself. Jin was still frantically packing when I arrived just after 9:00.<br />
Fritz appeared minutes after me, carrying breakfast. (Had I known, I wouldn&#8217;t have hit Tim Horton&#8217;s before coming over.) Scarfing down a sausage McMuffin and a hashbrown, we proceeded to cart down boxes, tables, cabinets, beds (in pieces, of course), sheets of glass (from the tables), chairs, bags of who-knows-what, candlesticks (big ones), lights, paintings &#8230; we wouldn&#8217;t taken the doors, the toilet, and the kitchen sink if we could have gotten away with them.<br />
The hardest part of moving is going out. Because everything is spread out, it&#8217;s hard to gauge how much room they&#8217;ll take in the truck. Although Fritz had rented a medium-sized U-Haul, it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear how well everything would fit. Having moved too many times for my own good, I was confident that we&#8217;d get everything there in one trip.<br />
Slowly, but sure, the truck began to fill up. Godfrey had brought his pick-up truck, which would end up carrying a spare bed and a bicycle. Adrian&#8217;s Golf carried the TV and the computer. My Mini carried the glass from the tables. The truck was filled quite well, but far from capacity. We could have quite easily packed in many more things, but ultimately there was no need for such efficiency. Besides, Fritz and Jin don&#8217;t have that much stuff.<br />
(In fact, that ended up being a debate: who had more stuff in their move? Tamara and myself, or Fritz and Jin? We couldn&#8217;t decide.)<br />
The new condo is quite literally that &#8212; new. In fact, it&#8217;s still being finished. The condo was supposed to be ready last year. An accident set off one of the largest fires seen in Calgary, destroying most of the complex, and damaging a few units that had been finished years earlier. (Critical Mass&#8217; HR director fled home when she found out to save her cat. Luckily, her unit was spared damage.)<br />
The smell of fresh paint, carpet adhesive, and fresh-cut wood permeated the air. Banging could be heard from nearly every direction. (The crews have been working non-stop to finish the condos.) Our first obstacle was finding a place to park &#8212; the streets around Fritz and Jin&#8217;s condo were littered with construction vehicles. We ended up in a no-park zone.<br />
Next obstacle: stairs. There were no ramps, no direct access to the lobby. The architects weren&#8217;t particularly bright on that point, in my opinion. Lucky, nothing was particularly heavy. All we had to do was reverse the process (significantly easier) and move everything into the condo.<br />
Unpacking the trucks and cars would have taken less time than packing, were it not for the stairs and an elevator that were &#8220;in the way&#8221;. But even with that and Godfrey&#8217;s early departure, we still finished the move in about four hours. There was only one causality, a floor lamp that appeared to have had the threads stripped from one of its joints. (The lamp still works.)<br />
The move over, Fritz returned the U-Haul, and we headed over to Fujiyama for a post-move meal. Adrian, Doug, Fritz and Jin would return to the condo to sort out the contents. I, however, had a house to paint. Or more specifically, needed to get supplies with which to paint.<br />
Luckily, I knew what I wanted. Basic white paint, a can of green for accents, a couple of brushes, and a paint gun. Yeah, I know &#8212; what do I really need a paint gun for? Why not use brushes, right? Well, considering the amount of painting that I&#8217;ll need to do on a (semi-)regular basis, I think the cost of the paint gun will far outweigh the time I&#8217;d have to spend painting by hand. And it&#8217;ll save wrist strain.<br />
One other thing that I needed to get, which I determined after an inability to borrow one from someone, was a power washer. Every single site I read and every person I talked to said that I had to wash my house before applying the paint, otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t stick as well. Trips to Wal-Mart and Canadian Tire revealed models running from $129 to over $800. I settled for a little 1200 PSI Karcher.<br />
Rent? Oh yeah, I could have definitely rented both. But I&#8217;d have paid for it in the long run. The paint gun would have run me up quickly, to the point where I&#8217;d have paid more for renting than for owning. As for the power washer, the only rentals were gas-powered monsters that could strip not only the paint but probably some of the wood. (For the record, 1200 PSI is *plenty* for washing dirt, etc. from a house.)<br />
Changing into my painting clothes, I set about to wash down the house and prepare to start painting the next day. For the next three or so hours, I proceeded to get very wet and very dirty. I had paint chips, dirt, insect carcases, water (of course), and Heaven-knows-what-else rain down on me as I removed all the gunk the house has been collecting since the last time someone took the time to do the job. I&#8217;m reasonably certain it wasn&#8217;t the last owner.<br />
With the house dripping wet, there was nothing I could do until the next morning. Tired from a day of moving and cleaning, I opted for a steak dinner. On my way to the store, I felt the need to obtain a cold beverage with which to relax. Imagine my shock and delight when, wedged next to Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown, I found the long-missed lime-green packaging of Steam Whistle Pilsner. Life was definitely getting better.<br />
Originally planning to rise at 8:00, I evicted myself from bed around 9:00, opting for an extra hour of rest. Saturday still had me worn out, and I had a long day ahead of me.<br />
Task #1: Read the instructions for the paint gun. The last thing I want to do is screw the thing up. With the early morning, it was an ideal time to try and paint a portion of the house not easily seen &#8212; the north cupola (containing the bathroom) wall. This requires me to climb onto the roof on my fancy-schmancy ladder. (It bends in three places to help me do just what I was trying to do.)<br />
This is when I found out just how steep my roof is, and how there was no way I would have been able to reshingle the roof on my own. In fact, the roof is so steep that I couldn&#8217;t even climb off the ladder (which bent onto the roof) and climb up on my own. The shingles don&#8217;t help &#8212; they&#8217;re flat so there&#8217;s no grit on which to gain a foothold. I only managed to paint part of the small wall. As it was more a test than a task, I didn&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
As a result of my resounding non-success, I realized that I needed a paint roller to reach the more inaccessible areas. Either that, or mountaineering gear so I could climb up the side of my roof. Either, I resolved to paint the rest later.<br />
The rising sun prevented me from tackling the rear or east walls. (I&#8217;m leaving the west wall for sometime later, when there&#8217;s less pressure. You can&#8217;t see it unless you go into my neighbour&#8217;s yard, anyway.) I wasn&#8217;t too keen on doing the front of the house until I had a little more practice with the gun. I decided to give the stripped windows their first shot of green paint.<br />
About 11:30, I broke for a shower. Nana had invited me to the grand opening of her condo complex in the north end of town, and I wasn&#8217;t about to show up looking like I&#8217;d just done battle against a flock of birds with the runs.<br />
Nana lives in a retirement complex. Basically, an apartment building for people with not as much mobility as they once had. The amenities include a cafeteria (with pretty decent food, I&#8217;m told), nice views of a small man-made lake, exercise room, library, theatre (and a darn nice one, at that), and a wonderful little courtyard. The complex is next to a new strip-mall that has an IGA, various little shops, and 17 food service establishments.<br />
Nana fed me lunch. It was supposed to be a BLT, but I don&#8217;t like raw T. In fact, I can&#8217;t stand &#8217;em. I can eat T any other way, just not raw. So I had a BLC (cheese). It was still yummy.<br />
The party started around 13:00, and we hung around for about 45 minutes. It seemed to be little more than just a gathering. There seemed to be no official announcements, or greetings, or ceremony of any kind. Nana opted to give me the guided tour of the facilities in lieu of waiting around for something that didn&#8217;t seem to be happening.<br />
We ended up at the balcony at the end of her hallway, just down from her apartment. The balcony looks north across the lake. It&#8217;s a wonderful view, even if it is towards another complex being built on the north side of the lake. We sat and talked for almost an hour before I took my leave to resume my house painting.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t go right home &#8212; I made a stop by Revy to pick up the paint roller, tray, and an extension so I could reach those hard-to-reach places. I didn&#8217;t even get in the main entrance when my cell phone rang. It was my friend (and realtor) Robyn. Robyn has taken it upon herself (bless the woman) to be a matchmaker, and I&#8217;m her latest project.<br />
It was a set-up. I knew it was. Just like Thursday night, when we&#8217;d met for drinks down at the Barley Mill. Unlike that time, however, plans were fairly definite: a movie at 19:05 where I&#8217;d meet Robyn&#8217;s mysterious woman. (We have talked on the phone &#8212; an impromptu Robyn set-up, when we were at the pub.) Although it was a movie I&#8217;d already seen, I figured that I&#8217;d like to meet this woman, I could stand to get out for a while, and besides &#8212; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; is actually a pretty good movie.<br />
Back at the ranch, I unpacked my newly-gotten booty, and got on with the show. The east wall was now in the shade, leaving me to start painting. I opted for the middle third of the wall, which is the section the cupola runs off of. The rollers helped me get the very top, which even my rather-long step ladder can&#8217;t reach. Of course, I got almost as much paint on me as I did on the wall and overhang.<br />
Reaching the level, it was time for me to change and prepare for the movie. (Note: I do not use the word &#8220;date&#8221;. It was a group event, as to remove any pressure.) Just as I was about to walk out the door for the trip up, my phone rang. It was Robyn. It appeared that my mystery woman had developed car trouble, and had decided not to go. This pretty much eliminated my desire to go out, since I could finish more painting.<br />
When I explained to Robyn that I&#8217;d rather paint, she was disappointed. But when I mentioned that I&#8217;d already seen the movie, she squealed in delight. I was willing to go see a movie I&#8217;d already seen just so I could meet a girl! I suddenly felt like I was in high school again. (Of course, this sort of thing *never* happened to me in high school.)<br />
Back into my painting gear, I tackled the rest of the east wall, and slid around to the east side of the south wall. I shut down the paint gun for the night after that. Although very fast, it&#8217;s quiet noisy and would probably bother my neighbours. I opted to give the windows a second coat of green, and apply a first coat to the window sills on the east wall.<br />
The sunlight gone along with the remainder of my energy, I went for a late dinner. I already knew that today was going to be rough. My arms are sore (from holding a fully-extended paint roller at a distance), my feet are killing me (standing on ladders), and I&#8217;ve got paint edged under every fingernail.<br />
And I&#8217;ve still got about 3/4 of a house to paint.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve often heard it said that there&#8217;s nothing like the sound of pitter-pattering around your home. This weekend, I found that sometimes this sound isn&#8217;t so nice. Like when your hot water heater is leaking.<br />
I noticed it in the early afternoon on Saturday, shortly after the third load of laundry had finished in the washer. There was a hissing noise emanating from the basement. I assumed at first that this was from the heater reheating. But the noise didn&#8217;t stop.<br />
Further inspection &#8212; actually *looking* at the heater &#8212; revealed hot water leaking from the relief valve. This was the first time I actually had a mild panic as a homeowner. How the hell could I stop/fix this? I knew a little of hot water heaters, but not enough to fix one. Luckily for me, my sister married an original Mr. Fix-It.<br />
A phone call to Ontario found my sister and brother-in-law in the glow of having just finished the installation of their kitchen skylight. Cathy was a tad surprised to hear me ask for Craig. (Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around.) Craig gave me a few ideas as what to do, and some ideas of maintenance. The first step: hook up a garden hose and purge the tank. While purging, open the valve a couple of times and clean it out.<br />
The relief valve on a hot water tank is a very simple (but very vital) piece of equipment. A hot water tank runs at about 150 psi. While that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, if a hot water tank were to explode at that pressure, you could say good-bye to your house and everything in it. That&#8217;s what the relief valve is for. It&#8217;s set to open at 150 psi and bleed off excess pressure before something nasty happens.<br />
Except mine was just open. After purging the tank, the leak was even worse. Another call to Ontario. This time, I removed the valve from the tank. That&#8217;s when I found the culprit of all my problems. Although I can&#8217;t tell for sure, the inside of my tank seems to be lined with about a half inch of calcium deposits. If ever there was an advertisment for water softeners, this is it. The temperature probe on the valve was so encrusted, and I had to pull quite hard to get it out.<br />
Thus began my repair project: immersing in a glass full of CLR and trying to get the thing to work properly. My grandiose plans for hitting the gym and getting in a little exercise before events in the evening were rapidly going to pot. By 19:00, the best I&#8217;d been able to do is a slight (but still noticeable) leak. And that was with a lower temperature. At least I could have a shower.<br />
I left for a party hosted by Chrissie, a fellow co-worker, around 21:00 &#8212; the valve returned to its CLR bath for the next 15 hours.<br />
While we wait for the valve to soak, let me tell you about this party. Chrissie, a long-standing CM employee, wanted to throw a &#8220;nothing to do with Stampede&#8221; party. For those of you not in the know, we&#8217;re currently immersed in the Calgary Stampede, which means the invasion of this city by every cowboy wannabe in the world for two weeks of &#8230; well, probably the best explanation is drunken stupidity. I&#8217;m really glad I no longer live right downtown.<br />
Held in the southeast quadrant of town, Chrissie is in an area that I had previously thought I wouldn&#8217;t want to live in. But her house was gorgeous &#8212; owned and renovated over a few months by Capri and Jason (other co-workers). They&#8217;d done it mostly for fun. (Yes, they&#8217;re both crazy.) It made for a great party venue.<br />
The soiree had a fairly healthy cross-section of the company, new to veteran, programmer to artist. And three DJs (two of whom are on my WebDev team) who kept the tunes running for the next few hours. There were about 60 people there, though it was hard to get an accurate count &#8212; people kept coming and going all night.<br />
One of the key reasons was to jointly celebrate Cory and Laura&#8217;s birthdays (both on Sunday). And hey, like we really need a good excuse to get together and have fun. The trick is just to avoid talking about work.<br />
Shawn came out, too. It was good to see him again. Shawn&#8217;s been on leave for a couple of months, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to his return at the end of the month. It&#8217;s just been too quiet without him around.<br />
I value Shawn&#8217;s opinion, mostly because he&#8217;s about as genuine as they come. Towards the end of the evening, Shawn and I were talking on the couch, when he mentioned that it was good to see &#8220;the Old Sowrey&#8221; again. I was a tad confused at first. I know I&#8217;m among the older folk in the WebDev group, but I didn&#8217;t realize I&#8217;d become the &#8220;Old Sowrey&#8221;. But Shawn qualified this by adding that the &#8220;New Sowrey&#8221; had worried him.<br />
Basically, Shawn had remembered what I was like in my first year and a half here. I was loud, obnoxious, and apparently a lot more fun. In the last year, I&#8217;ve become much more business-oriented, more focussed, and apparently a lot less fun. The thing is &#8212; I agreed with Shawn&#8217;s assessment. My ambition to rise in the ranks had led me to reforming myself to be more &#8220;appealing&#8221; to those who would promote me. I succeeded (far more than I thought possible) in that aspect, but inadvertantly led me to failing in another.<br />
The team dynamic is everything. No-one gets into the WebDev group unless they&#8217;ve got the attitude to go along with the skill. It was that attitude that I&#8217;d slowly been killing over the last year. I&#8217;ve actually become *too* professional.<br />
Before you start objection with this analysis, I&#8217;ll point out that this was not some snap decision. This was a bit of a revelation (even if it was someone pointing out the obvious), and I did spend some time truly thinking about it. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m going to have to keep an eye on. I want to be a professional, but the last thing I want to do is have that get in the way of having fun with my teammates.<br />
We left the party around 04:00. We knew we were ready when Cory just upped and walked out the front door. I&#8217;d stopped drinking about two hours earlier, knowing that I&#8217;d be driving people home. Originally it was just Shawn. But Candace abandoned Cory at the party, meaning he&#8217;d need a lift home. And Reid, who&#8217;d somehow managed to hang out that long, asked for a ride since he wasn&#8217;t far from Cory&#8217;s place.<br />
The ride back to Cory&#8217;s was fairly quick, though he lives at the south-west edge of town. At four in the morning, most of the intersection lights are blinking (amber on the main thoroughfare, red on the minor ones) &#8212; only major intersections have their lights still in normal operation. Which was good for Cory.<br />
We hit our only red light when we got to Southland and MacLeod. Cory, sitting in the front passenger seat, nonchalantly turned and opened the door. At first, I thought he was going to get out. (Cory was still quite loaded at this point, and I&#8217;ve seen drunks do weird things at early hours of the morning.) Cory leaned over, but not to get out of the car. He cursed me later for taking so long to stop at a light.<br />
As Shawn and I returned to downtown (Shawn lives not too far from my house), we noted that the sun was taking an awfully long time to set. It was then we realized that it was so late that it was early. Already, I knew that my sleeping schedule was going to be really screwed up for the next couple of days.<br />
Meanwhile, back at the hot water heater&#8230;<br />
Awaking around 13:00 (having gone back to bed after Jim called me at 10:15 to play disc golf, which I sleepily refused), I returned to the hot water tank problem. The valve had sat in CLR all night, and was glistening clean &#8212; no more rust or calcium. Figuring this was good, I taped it up and slapped it back in. A couple small drips.<br />
Fixed, right? Wrong. There shouldn&#8217;t be any drips. So it was off to Revy to get a new valve, and some piping for a drain pipe (the previous owner didn&#8217;t have one). Luckily, this stuff is so standard it was almost ridiculous how fast I picked up the valve, a 3/4&#8243; adapter (for the pipe), a connector, a three-foot section of copper tubing, and a plumbing soldering kit (I didn&#8217;t have one yet, and it was as good an excuse as any to get one).<br />
Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t purchase the valve with the intent to replace it right away. Actually, I had hoped the dripping would stop while I was gone. I might have been able to deal with a periodic drip, but when I raised the temperature to its normal setting, gushing water sealed the fate of the valve. It had to go.<br />
Luckily, my father had taught me how to install plumbing when I was a kid. I&#8217;m no expert, but I can handle most of the simple stuff. Probably couldn&#8217;t do a home improvement show, but as far as a pressure relief valves go, I&#8217;m good as gold. All I have to do now is sit back and wait to see what will go wrong next.<br />
My bet&#8217;s on the furnace&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Canada Day, most people take the time to go do something special, like visit events in their local community or town, possibly visit one of Canada&#8217;s majestic national parks (which are free today), or visit the local taverns and have one of Canada&#8217;s national beverages with friends.<br />
Me? I hang around with trains.<br />
Okay, before everyone gets all over me for doing &#8220;the train thing&#8221; again, I have to say that this is for the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, not me. Given the choice, I&#8217;d probably have hung out in and around the just-reopened Prince&#8217;s Island Park for the day. I probably would have avoided the killer sunburn I managed to get on my face. (You&#8217;d think that since I planned ahead and brought sunblock that I&#8217;d use it. Shows how much you know!)<br />
Every year on Canada Day, the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (I&#8217;m going to write &#8220;RMRS&#8221; from herein &#8212; it&#8217;s a long name to type) puts on a &#8220;show&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a show, but a chance for us to connect with some of the local enthusiasts, show off some of our equipment (the &#8220;Eagle Springs&#8221; combine car &#8212; no, not the farm type, a beautiful 1930&#8217;s passenger car, and our Alco S-3 diesel. This stuff usually just sits in Calgary because we can&#8217;t normally do anything with it. But on Canada Day, not only do people get to see this stuff, but they get to ride it, too.<br />
Starting last year, Don managed to get us into the old CP Ogden Shops (now the Alstom Shops) to hold our show. It&#8217;s very handy, since that&#8217;s where our equipment is being stored here in Calgary. It&#8217;s also convenient, since there&#8217;s a plethora of rail equipment from multiple owners all over the massive complex.<br />
We&#8217;d been out twice before Canada Day, getting things ready. Last Wednesday, it was vacuuming the cars and general clean-up. Yesterday, it was preparing the display and getting things roughly set up. And making a few repairs to CP&#8217;s display cars (graciously donated for the day so there was more than just our stuff around) &#8212; during switching, someone had flattened the railing needed to hook the stairs to get in. Nothing a blowtorch, sledgehammer, and prybar won&#8217;t fix.<br />
Don&#8217;t try this at home, kids, we&#8217;re experienced professionals. (We do this to 6060 all the time.)<br />
This morning was gorgeous. Which was great for me, since I had to spend the first 45 minutes awake in the gym. Arthur (friend, co-worker, and workout buddy) has put me on a new torture regimen. He claims my butt&#8217;s going to be in severe pain tomorrow. I truly hope not. Especially with all the walking and standing I did today&#8230;<br />
A massive volunteer crew &#8212; the largest I&#8217;ve ever seen for the RMRS &#8212; was beginning to assemble when I arrived at Ogden just after 11:00 (ironically enough, I was delayed by a freight train). Thus began an hour of hurried unpacking, setting up, moving of heavy objects, taping off areas verboten, and making sure everything was ready after the various cars were switched into their locations. CP loaned us the use of a SW 900 diesel-electric switcher (#6711), their historic mail car (#3266), and towed the train down the south side of the Ogden yard for about 2200 yards before returning, to give people a little ride.<br />
The crowd we got was a lot larger than I thought it would be. We don&#8217;t publicize this (for a variety of reasons), so we don&#8217;t get a lot of people. Still, most of our chairs were filled. It was pretty impressive, I think. We had the deputy mayor, the head of CP&#8217;s Heritage division, and representatives from the RCMP out to represent not only rail history, but of course, Canada&#8217;s history. It is Canada Day, after all.<br />
The afternoon shot by. Before I knew it, the clock read 16:00, and everyone was gone. We packed up, shunted the cars, and were ready to go home just after 17:00. Which was great, because my head was killing me.<br />
That&#8217;s when I realized I&#8217;d had too much sun. Tomorrow&#8217;s gonna hurt.</p>
