	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept fitfully. I don&#8217;t really know why. But when I awoke Christmas morning, there was a slight sense of excitement. Perhaps I&#8217;d been depressed the day before and not taken notice. (The reason why, of course, still remains a mystery.) It&#8217;s just as easy to believe that there was nothing special about this day, nothing more than the same dull drudgery I feel that I face more often than I care to admit to.<br />
I showered, shaved, and dressed for the day. I would not return until after Christmas dinner, so the objective was to look as presentable as possible, without being uncomfortable all day long. Fed the cat, and hopped in my car for Brenda and Mike&#8217;s. I was to be there for 9:00, so we could begin Christmas morning.<br />
Mom and Nana were running a little late, but not so much that the entire day was thrown out of whack. They arrived not long after me, and with mimosas and/or coffee in hand, we proceeded to the living room. There were six of us, and more than enough presents all around. We even had stockings, despite protests that we didn&#8217;t really need them.<br />
Inside, the slight excitement grew. Unfortunately, the feeling was a little sickening, becase it felt materialistic. I didn&#8217;t want to receive gifts so much as I wanted to give them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I like receiving gifts as much as the next person, but the acquisition of materials goods just isn&#8217;t the driving force for me that used to rule my early childhood. The anticipation, however &#8212; that I will never miss.<br />
Jen got a digital camera, one she has to share with Brenda. The key reason is that so Jen will have it when she goes to Japan with me in late March. It will be an experience of a lifetime, and she needs to record every event. Mike and Jen played with it most of the morning &#8230; no, I take that back &#8212; most of the day. Mom received a personal chef service from the family, and a foot massager from Cathy, Craig, and myself. Brenda received some nice clothes, as did Nana. Mike made off with a Belgian beer selection.<br />
As for me, I got a good book on the Canadian Pacific Railway (&#8220;Stand Fast, Craigellachie!&#8221;), a pocket watch with an engraved train, funds for landscaping the house, movies, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and a cuckoo clock. The clock, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a Mini-brand product. Every hour, instead of a little bird, a little red car pops out of its little doors, revs its engine, and beeps its horn. Cathy couldn&#8217;t resist getting it for me. I could barely stop giggling.<br />
The video game (&#8220;Grand Theft Auto&#8221;) came from Tamara, my roommate. This had been a trying year for us. Tamara was laid off from Critical Mass in June. In lieu of her having to move out, I just didn&#8217;t ask for rent. Until she was contracted back (for five months!), Tamara didn&#8217;t pay rent. I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; why would I do that? Simple: It&#8217;s far harder to find a perfect roommate than it is to lose money. Considering how well we get along, the last thing I needed was for her to have to move out. With her contract now expired, that is a possibility, but one I hope won&#8217;t come soon. Tamara and I both know the situation, and how it makes the other person feel. Tamara&#8217;s card, despite being aimed at young children, made me cry.<br />
Breakfast followed, as did my traditional butt-whipping at video games. (Jen usually creams me on the game of choice.) By 15:00, it was time to head up to Nana&#8217;s. We had to prepare for dinner.<br />
When Nana had moved into her complex, she had immediately made arrangements for us to use the Family Dining Room for our great family feast. While all fine and dandy, this did pose a couple of logistical problems, most notably the cooking of the turkey. (In fact, this simple thing created what I can only describe as the first great family feud in my memory. In the end, Uncle David took over turkey preparation, while Mom and Brenda just fumed about the whole situation.) Seating arrangements weren&#8217;t too difficult to sort out.<br />
The feud did not continue when everyone arrived. Instead, we prepared dinner, with everyone chipping in for details (moving furniture, making parts of the meals, grabbing things from Nana&#8217;s room). By 17:45, we were all seated around the massive table, eating. It was the earliest I can ever remember having Christmas dinner.<br />
Following the meal, and before we all partook of dessert, Uncle David presented a slide show. They were old photos of the family from the 1940s and 1950s, when the &#8220;children&#8221; (namely, Mom, David, and Brenda) were still young. Some of the slides were creepy &#8212; there were two where we were all convinced the subject was Cathy, not Mom.<br />
By 21:00, the Family Dining Room looked like we hadn&#8217;t even been there. Everything was cleaned, packed up, and on its way back out to the cars. We grouped together in a room just off the lobby, overlooking the complex&#8217;s dining room, for a family photo. Darren, Jen, and I all took ones with our digital cameras. I wish I&#8217;d brought my larger one &#8212; it can handle the zoom a lot better than my small one.<br />
I was back at the gym bright and early the next morning. I had a very high calorie dinner to try and burn off. I didn&#8217;t get through a lot of it, because I had to be at Pam&#8217;s for 10:30 for brunch. It was the collection of families that had been at the Hovey&#8217;s two nights earlier (see [[It Just Doesn&#8217;t Feel Like Christmas Eve]]), just a different venue. Pam and crew had been preparing breakfast for some time. We mingled until the breakfast bell was rung, and it was time to eat. I have gotta get the recipe for Pam&#8217;s mediterranean breakfast dish. Very tasty.<br />
During breakfast, an idea crept through my little head. It&#8217;s Friday, and I want to go see a matinee. Specifically, &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221;. It dawned on me that Jen had probably not seen it. Sure enough, she hadn&#8217;t. I proposed a plan to relieve Mike and Brenda of their daughter for the afternoon, doing some shopping down at A&amp;B Sound (the two of us had gift certificates to take care of), and then see the movie. All parties were in favour.<br />
A&amp;B Sound was far from packed, but we&#8217;d also long-missed the door crasher specials they&#8217;d had when the doors opened at 7:00 that morning. Fortunately, the discounts on white- and red-tagged prices were still in effect. It also meant we could get through the store without constantly bumping into people, and not spend forever in the checkout line.<br />
Dumping our new-gotten goods in the car, we headed over to Eau Claire Market for the movie. Having a little time before the movie, we endulged in some games in the adjacent arcade. Either Jen was having an off day, or was being merciful. I won all three games of air hockey, a fighting game (Marvel vs. Capcom, if memory serves me right) that I had no idea how to play or what was going on, and a racing game that really wasn&#8217;t that good anyway. Jen still served me my heiny on a platter in Soul Caliber 2, though.<br />
Popcorn and pop in hand, we sat down for the movie. A long one, too. But an interesting one. Not everyone is a fan of Tom Cruise, but he does a very good job in this movie. The short explanation is that it&#8217;s about a civil war veteran who ends up in Japan during the Meiji Reformation to train Japan&#8217;s new army in modern weapons. He&#8217;s captured by the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a group of samurai) and learns about the way of the warrior &#8212; something he&#8217;d lost while fighting in America. Knowing something of Japanese history, it was quite interesting to see, and I wonder how accurate it might really be.<br />
Returning to the Znack&#8217;s, we had leftovers from last night&#8217;s dinner. Just not quite so much. I didn&#8217;t stay too late, though, as I had laundry to tackle &#8212; I&#8217;m running out of clean clothes.<br />
Besides, it gave me a great excuse to watch the movies I got for Christmas.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Tis the night before Christmas,<br />
and all through the house,<br />
the cat is sound sleeping,<br />
as I sit here with my mouse.<br />
No stockings are hung<br />
by a chimney with care,<br />
just thrown in the laundry bin<br />
&#8216;cuz I have more to wear<br />
No children are nestled<br />
all snug in their beds,<br />
The only visions I see<br />
are of oncoming dread.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already noticed, I&#8217;m a little down this Christmas. I mean, it&#8217;s Christmas Eve, and I&#8217;m sitting in front of my computer, wondering what all the hulabaloo is about. When I was a kid &#8212; heck, even two years ago (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]) &#8212; Christmas meant something. It was an occasion. As I sit here in front of my computer, it&#8217;s just a day, no different than any other.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas. Maybe because there was no lead-in, no real build-up. It&#8217;s just &#8220;here&#8221;. Sure, I went to the malls &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t have missed the Christmas decorations if you were Helen Keller. But that&#8217;s not Christmas to me. My mother is here, as is a large portion of my family. Cathy and Craig are back in Oakville, and my Aunt Ruth and cousins Erica and Lauren are in the Toronto area. But is it their presence I miss?<br />
Last year was my first Christmas in Calgary. I have family here &#8212; I didn&#8217;t really miss anything. But is it that? Is that what I am missing? Not just my family here &#8212; but *all* of my family? I don&#8217;t know. Sure, it&#8217;s the second Christmas in a row without Cathy. Without my immediate family. It&#8217;s also the second Christmas without Dad. No loud Christmas music, no massive amounts of decorations, none of the usual triggers one would expect for this season.<br />
At least, none for me. There are plenty of other people looking forward to tomorrow. But not me. It&#8217;s just another day, just one where I don&#8217;t have to work. I think, if anything, I&#8217;m a little depressed. It&#8217;s too easy to lose touch with the things you need or want. It&#8217;s not about possessions &#8212; it&#8217;s about feeling. And maybe this year, I&#8217;m not feeling up to snuff.<br />
Earlier this year, I started dating someone for the first time since arriving in Calgary. While we are no longer together (we are friends), that experience awoke a number of things within me that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. I suppose it&#8217;s wholly possible that some of these feelings are contributing to the problems I&#8217;m having. It could be that I&#8217;m incapable of enjoying Christmas this year because of that.<br />
But admittedly, I don&#8217;t really know. All I do know is that it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas to me. And I can only hope that the feeling is short-lived. I don&#8217;t want to go through the rest of my life feeling like this every December 25th.<br />
But don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t spend my time at home this evening. Tonight, we went out to visit with Aunt Alaine&#8217;s family, who are holding court out in Chestermere, about 20 kms east of Calgary along Hwy 16 (aka Trans Canada Highway). It&#8217;s a short drive, not far from my Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike&#8217;s &#8230; or would be, if we had proper directions.<br />
Getting to Chestermere is easy, don&#8217;t get me wrong. What&#8217;s not so easy? Finding the right house. Why is this so difficult? Because we neglected to get the address, or directions once inside Chestermere before we left the house. This left us circling the endless labyrinth of streets in a vain search for the Hovey residence.<br />
Jen and I got frustrated. While everyone else seemed content to say &#8220;Oh! *This* is the right street!&#8221;, we were content to grab the cell phone, call the house, and announce that we were lost and needed directions. (I was a bit snarky about it, too &#8212; probably a result of the aforementioned frustration.)<br />
Unlike previous excursions to the Hovey&#8217;s (at Easter &#8212; see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]], my family would not be the only ones in attendance. The Tisdales were already in attendance, as were the various relatives on Alaine&#8217;s side of the yard. Several &#8220;kids&#8221; (namely, those a lot younger than I). Luckily, I get along well with the rest of the adults.<br />
We left shortly after 22:00, returning to Calgary. After a brief stop at Brenda and Mike&#8217;s, I drove Mom and Nana to Nana&#8217;s complex, where I swapped the van for my car (left at the complex when we&#8217;d done a run up earlier in the day). In a few short hours, I will be back at Chez Znack for Christmas Day.<br />
Something that, for what seems to be the first time in my life, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>
