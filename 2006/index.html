		<p>Alex took a pregnancy test this morning.<br />
Positive.<br />
We&#8217;re in shock. Alex more than me. I&#8217;m so much in shock in even in a bit of denial. And I want another test. But not because I don&#8217;t want to be a father &#8212; I want to be certain. No disappointment. No false positives. I want no wiggle room for doubt.<br />
Fatherhood. Parent. Dad.<br />
Am I ready for this? Am I prepared to take on the responsibility of caring for a child &#8212; my child &#8212; bringing them into this world and raising them in the best way possible?<br />
Without question, my life is about to change again. I used to say that I was &#8220;18 years old with 16 years experience&#8221;. But maybe I really am 34 and should start acting my age. But doesn&#8217;t a child bring out the child in all of us?<br />
I hope this is the one. I hope that this my offspring. I hope&#8230;<br />
I look forward to meeting you in a few months. I can only begin to dream of the things you&#8217;ll teach me, of the wonders we&#8217;ll discover.</p>

		<p>Alex slept better in a king-size hotel bed. Not so much for myself. I was tired. Grumpy. Irritable.<br />
That&#8217;s why I was particularly annoyed with the complete and utter disappearance of my deodorant (which I <em>know</em> I had with me) and two T-shirts. They&#8217;ve totally disappeared. I have no idea what the heck has happened to them.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I&#8217;m taking VIA from London to Oakville, saving Alex from another four hours of driving on Ontario&#8217;s highways. I&#8217;m sitting here with my trusty laptop trying to do some work, using the &#8220;Wi-Fi&#8221; service on-board.<br />
Except it doesn&#8217;t work.<br />
I can connect to the onboard gateway, no problem. It recognizes me and that I&#8217;ve been desperately trying to send and/or receive something. Anything in fact. It has my byte counts. What it doesn&#8217;t do is actually let me receive any data. So far, I&#8217;ve not even been able to pull up a Google search.<br />
I call false advertising! It doesn&#8217;t work, VIA &#8212; don&#8217;t tell me that it&#8217;s there if it doesn&#8217;t work. And it isn&#8217;t my laptop, as I know I can connect to virtually any wireless network I&#8217;ve ever seen. I can see yours but you won&#8217;t let me see anything else!<br />
Mind you, could be someone else on this train using up all the bandwidth for porn&#8230;<br />
(And if you&#8217;re wondering how on Earth I posted this despite not having any connectivity, I offer the simplistic Notepad + Copy &amp; Paste method.)<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: When we got past Brantford, it actually seemed to work, albeit not very well. I wouldn&#8217;t rely on VIA&#8217;s WiFi service for anything mission-critical, though it was still better than the next-to-nothing access I had with the CBC.]</em></p>

		<p>We arrived last night, around 20:00 local time. A quick run through the airport, and we were tracking through the back country out to Janice&#8217;s place in Kintore.<br />
The house was cool (old farm houses tend to lack a lot of insulation or it mostly needs to be replaced) so Alex was a little chilly most of the time. We watched <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0479647/">Bon Cop Bad Cop</a></em> until around midnight or so (22:00 our time) before we were tired enough to go to sleep. I&#8217;d picked it up during what will be my last bout of Boxing Day sales. They&#8217;re hardly sales, since most of the prices (for the things I wanted) were still steep.<br />

		<p>The saga of Alex&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s passing continues.<br />
The funeral arrangements changed from when I booked my flight out and return. The funeral is now on the Friday (instead of the Thursday), which sadly doesn&#8217;t work for me. Because of work, I really need to make the effort to be in Calgary to keep things afloat. I&#8217;ll be there for visitation, but not for the funeral itself.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s as it currently stands. I just realized what the times actually are, and this might not work as originally planned&#8230; Ugh. The debate will continue.<br />
Dinner at Brenda and Mike&#8217;s was very filling. (I expect no less, of course.) It was a variation on the traditional turkey. This one was prepared with chilies, yams, green beans, and a spicy gravy. It was very good, but not what one would expect for Christmas dinner. But that&#8217;s why I like Aunt Brenda&#8217;s cooking &#8212; she rarely sticks with the norm.<br />
We got a preview of Jen&#8217;s work since starting university. It&#8217;s creepy how fast she&#8217;s progressing now. I knew she had talent. It&#8217;s something else to see how far she&#8217;s come in mere months of instruction. She has a long future ahead of her in art &#8212; that much I&#8217;m sure of.<br />
We came back to dive into the hot tub only to realize that yes, in fact, the fucking thing is still broken. There&#8217;s a leak in an area I can&#8217;t get to easily. I&#8217;m going to have to take part of the side off to find out what&#8217;s actually wrong and plug the leak. For now, the cold weather is working to our advantage and is freezing to prevent too much drippage. I&#8217;ve dropped the temperature to keep it from melting.<br />
Still, a pain in the arse.<br />
We fly out tomorrow around 14:30. Before then, I hope to get in some Boxing Day sales. Gonna have to get up early, though.<br />
A strange Christmas, indeed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>After yesterday&#8217;s marathon church-o-rama, I wasn&#8217;t able to stay up watching <em>A Christmas Story</em> for long without falling asleep.<br />
But I was up shortly after 8:00 to make breakfast: pancakes and a ham, cheese, potato, and onion &#8220;mom saver&#8221; (Alex says I should call it a &#8220;husband saver&#8221;, since I made it). I buggered up the cheese sauce, though. Next year, cheese only. No liquids.<br />
Just as we were starting to unpack our stockings, the phone rang. It was Janice, Alex&#8217;s mom. Alex&#8217;s grandfather had died only 30 minutes earlier. It wasn&#8217;t unexpected &#8212; he&#8217;d had a stroke only a week or two earlier and the prognosis hadn&#8217;t been good. The funeral was even planned in the expectation.<br />
All things considered, this is the best thing that could happen. Alzheimer&#8217;s is an evil disease that robs a person of everything. He didn&#8217;t recognize his own children, and couldn&#8217;t understand why his wife was never around (she died two years ago). It&#8217;s been hard on Janice&#8217;s family, and it&#8217;s a burden that they can finally shed.<br />
Still, it makes for a bittersweet day.<br />
Alex and I took a moment to remember before getting into the presents under the tree. Asia got hers first &#8212; her catnip mouse literally bathed in fresh catnip. She was our entertainment while we ate.<br />
Alex did her best to get even with me for last year&#8217;s book bonanza. (Alex loves books, but I gave her a couple too many.) She found a really interesting one called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Sign-Qin-Outlaws-Moonshadow-Marsh/dp/0786819189/sr=8-1/qid=1167079740/ref=sr_1_1/701-7636550-3170709?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Sign of the Qin</a></em>, which I&#8217;d never heard of before but sounds interesting.

<p>If I get a chance to do Boxing Day shopping remains to be seen. Sadly, with the passing of Alex&#8217;s grandfather, this week is almost a write-off for us. Only time will see.<br />
We&#8217;re gearing up for dinner tonight at Mike and Brenda&#8217;s. That should prepare us for tomorrow&#8217;s excursion to Ontario. It&#8217;ll be good to see family for Christmas. I just wish it were under happier circumstances.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Christmas is almost here again, and I&#8217;m only now really getting into the groove. Until a couple of days ago, I was far too focused on work.<br />
In my defense, it&#8217;s not for a wanting to focus too much on work, it was purely out of necessity. We&#8217;re working on a huge project with a lot of challenges and expectations. In order to make sure we deliver well in time for our deadlines with the right level of quality, I need to spend a lot of time ensuring that the team has done their due diligence in getting it all ready, and helping them out as much as I can so they can focus on the need and not on the other requests circling above.<br />
That&#8217;s been my last two months or so.<br />
Somewhere in all that, I managed to buy Christmas presents for Alex. And that was about the only person I spent a lot of concerted effort on. Again, don&#8217;t get me wrong, it wasn&#8217;t for a lack of wanting to spend effort on others. It was time &#8212; specifically, the lack thereof. Were it not for Alex and her dedication, the rest of my family wouldn&#8217;t be receiving much more than a phone call.<br />
In fact, most of what we have this year is due to Alex. The decorations, the cards we mailed out, the food, the Christmas tree (I might have lugged it home &#8212; see [[Decorating for Christmas]] &#8212; but Alex make it look all pretty).<br />
Last week, I finally started backing off in work a bit. I need to, as did the rest of my team. (I practically had to threaten them to take a break and relax for a few days. Pressure doesn&#8217;t help, and if they don&#8217;t slack off a bit, the quality of work will definitely start suffering.)<br />
Friday night, I started to relax. Yesterday, Alex and I did a bit of running around for various things, notably a hard drive to reload our aging Dell computer. You can only load and unload so much software in Windows XP before you just have to bite the bullet and reload from scratch. Having a faster hard drive (and a secondary in the event of a catastrophic failure) is always a good thing.<br />
Today we&#8217;re doing the church thing. This morning was the Sunday service. You&#8217;ll note the omission of words such as &#8220;regular&#8221; or &#8220;normal&#8221;. The fourth Advent that happens to fall right on Christmas Eve seems to get a lot more attention than normal.<br />
Knox Presbyterian also hosts a Korean congregation that added considerably to the service. The Korean Pastor did a few parts of the service (Murdo did most of it), with the Korean Youth group performing a 30-minute multimedia pageant about how Jesus (never referred to by name, oddly enough) changed the world.<br />
I was a little uncomfortable at first &#8212; I usually am at such things, and I don&#8217;t know why &#8212; but I eventually got into it. It wasn&#8217;t hard to convince myself that I was watching a cultural show of sorts. It was the Korean perspective on Christianity. Different than what we see in Western Christianity, but the roots are the same.<br />
I still find it strange that Christianity has such a following with Eastern cultures. I always associate Buddhism with the East. I think there needs to be a Buddhmas, personally.<br />
Following the lengthy service was a potluck that Alex and I hadn&#8217;t even been aware of. We tried to get tea only to find it hadn&#8217;t been made yet. So while I boiled water, Alex got food. Complete with a healthy dose of Korean. The more traditional aspect of the Knox congregation obviously had some difficulty with some of the food (kimchee and nori, to be specific). Alex commented that she should have given me all the things she didn&#8217;t recognize.<br />
We&#8217;ve spent the afternoon at home lazing around. I reinstalled the toilet downstairs and finished enough reconfiguration of the the computer that Alex can at least check her email again reliably.<br />
We&#8217;re preparing for the second two (yes, <em>two</em>) services tonight. The first is the pageant for Knox at 18:00, then the carols at 22:00. Somewhere in all this, Alex and I will find time to eat and be merry, I presume.<br />
Oh, crap&#8230; I just remembered that I need to make the mom saver for tomorrow morning. I should get on that&#8230;</p>

		<p>Ah, Christmas! That time of the year when the happy cries of children resound through the neighbourhood, gingerbread wafts in the air mingled with the scent of pine, and angry shoppers wield heavy weaponry to acquire the hot toy of the year for their spoiled and ignored kids.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m still bitter about the over-commercialization of Christmas. Decorations should not be seen until late November. Christmas music not until December. Same with all the adverts on TV and radio &#8212; please restrict those to the appropriate <em>month</em>? Half a year is a little much in some cases. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like Christmas &#8212; I love almost everything about it. What I want is for it to remain <em>special</em>. If we have Christmas for most of the year, it becomes as common as Wednesdays, and we know how much fun your average Wednesday is.<br />
But I digress&#8230;<br />
My tasks were much simpler: clean, arrange (and purchase extra) lights, move some furniture, and carry a tree about a half kilometre (easier than it sounds, trust me).<br />
Everything began on the Saturday. We were having guests over on Sunday and wanted to have something ready for all to see and experience. Now I freely admit that I&#8217;ve not been putting in my part for Christmas preparations this year. Work has kept me very busy and trying to do all the home-related stuff has been &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that if I weren&#8217;t married, nothing would be done.<br />
Cleaning is always the hard part. We&#8217;ve both been so busy (me at work, Alex covering for me) that the house has slid into a state of minor disarray. And by minor, something just less than New Orleans after Katrina. Just without the flooding.<br />
Space had to be made for the tree as well. We wanted it in the window this year (like in <em>A Christmas Story</em>, but without the lamp), which meant the couch had to be moved. The entire thing was spun about 90 degrees clockwise and shoved a few metres north. The dining room table had to be rotated 90 degrees to make for easy walking around.<br />
We got the tree at the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market after breakfast on Saturday. A lovely Fraser Fir that not only looks great but has the most definitive &#8220;Christmas tree smell&#8221; that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. Can&#8217;t go wrong with that.<br />
While the branches dropped, we dealt with lights. Alex went through a few variations inside while I wrestled with the outside lights. I was previously a purist &#8212; if the light wasn&#8217;t incandescent, it wasn&#8217;t alight. I didn&#8217;t like the LED lights. They seemed &#8230; odd. But after wrestling with a mini-light set for 45 minutes to find the three burned out bulbs, I&#8217;ve converted. LEDs don&#8217;t burn out (easily). And they use <em>way</em> less electricity.<br />
I&#8217;m almost in Christmas mode now. If I can concentrate less on work, I might actually have a good time this year.<br />
Merry Ho Ho. I hope&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Wow.<br />
I&#8217;ve seen some pretty swanky parties, but this one definitely ranks high up there. And as more of a stunner, it was a Critical Mass party, too!<br />
Okay, clarification needed. Critical Mass&#8217; parties tend to be like this: Beer.<br />
It&#8217;s that simple. We tend not to do anything fancy because we&#8217;re a pretty down-to-earth kind of company. You don&#8217;t need much to make people happy. It&#8217;s a formula that&#8217;s worked well.<br />
Add spouses/significant others to the mix, and you really do need to dial things up. And boy-oh-boy, did the organizers do one hell of a job at that!<br />
Our party took place in the Big Four Building, Hall A. When I read that, the first thing that came to mind was the casino that&#8217;s there. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me to be in a casino (see [[The 2004 Critical Mass New Year Party]]), but somehow it didn&#8217;t seem right. (And I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;right&#8221; as in &#8220;right to do&#8221;; it just didn&#8217;t seem like we&#8217;d do it.) As it turns out, Hall A is a space I&#8217;ve noted before, but perennially forgotten about.<br />
The theme, as you&#8217;ve noticed, was about New York City. Why, I&#8217;m not sure. But it didn&#8217;t matter. The inside featured skylines (in projection), display cases from Bloomingdales and Macy&#8217;s, fake street signs. Christmas trees were everywhere. Not green ones &#8212; white and silver with wonderfully sparkly ornaments. A lone saxophone player jazzed along as we entered, his sound echoing through the massive room. A stage dominated the south wall, where Dewi (our Sound Producer) and his band would play some serious funk later on. The north wall was the bar (this is a <em>Critical Mass</em> party, don&#8217;t forget). The centre of the room were the tables.<br />
Alex was impressed. Thoroughly. Stunned, actually. She was envious that Critical Mass&#8217; party was better than her department&#8217;s. That made me feel pretty good, actually.<br />
We acquired a couple of drinks, toured the facilities, chatted with those who wandered in (I must have introduced Alex to about a hundred people &#8212; I&#8217;ll be surprised if she remembers <em>any</em> of them; I wouldn&#8217;t). Eventually we took a table with Torin, Danny, Pavel and their significant others to await dinner.<br />
For a place that&#8217;s renowned for their corn dogs, I do have to say that Stampede Catering makes a fine roast beef. The food was outstanding. The desserts were <em>deadly</em>. The conversation outstanding, even if we did have to try overpower the band.<br />
Although most took off early (only a small contingent ended up a Ducky&#8217;s; I was not one of them this time), it was not for lack of entertainment or a good time. It was, by many respects, one of Critical Mass&#8217; best soirees I think. The only thing I would have changed is the volume of music.<br />
Either that or I&#8217;m getting old&#8230;<br />

		<p>Yeah, I know &#8212; you&#8217;ve heard it before, and you&#8217;re gonna hear it again.<br />
I hate seeing good people leave.<br />
Can&#8217;t say I blame Scott Morgan, though. He did get a sweet deal. Especially for a Flash guy. It&#8217;s not every day that Yahoo! calls to say they need you. (Something I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll never hear.) And he would be a fool not to take a chance to try something big.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say we didn&#8217;t have something big here. But we&#8217;re talking orders of magnitude. Critical Mass is at best 500 people. Yahoo!&#8217;s a few times larger. Like 10. Ish. Redesigning Rolex.com is one thing. Overhauling Yahoo!&#8217;s Flash use, that&#8217;s something else.<br />
Scott&#8217;s only been here for just over a year, and his impact is pretty big. He took over the Flash group and really ran with it, getting things organized. He&#8217;s leaving behind <strong>big</strong> shoes to fill. I know who&#8217;s going to fill them, but that&#8217;s not really my place to say right now.<br />
On Friday, a bunch of us drifted down to the Ship and Anchor (&#8220;Where Critical Mass sets sail&#8230;&#8221;) for a last beverage with our now ex-comrade in arms. Scott, despite being officially out of the company at this point (his last day was yesterday) arrived late. There was a certain amount of irony in that.<br />
There were only two ways this would go: long and hard, or fast and easy. It ended up the latter, which I didn&#8217;t mind as I wasn&#8217;t keen on a hangover. (Though I did threaten to give Scott one.) It ended up just being the two of us, which lasted only until we were out of beer.<br />
Scott says he might be back some day. I&#8217;m not so sure. He&#8217;s got family to deal with, and moving them around is not always easy. That said, finding Flash people isn&#8217;t easy, either. So who knows &#8212; maybe if I&#8217;m still here two years from now, paths might cross again.<br />
&#8216;Cuz I doubt it&#8217;ll ever happen at Yahoo!</p>

		<p>There is little that I hate more than dishonesty. Especially when it&#8217;s a veil for incompetence.<br />
Take the vendor we&#8217;ve been working with lately (please). We&#8217;ve been asking them for what I think is a fairly simple set of assets. Nothing fancy, just a copy of the files on a server, a correct database backup, and configuration files.<br />
What we get are hums and hahs, deference, indifference, no answers to requests, near belligerency when we do get a response, incomplete information, missing information, or an outright disregarding of recommended instructions to make the path easier.<br />
Ultimately, we will have to save the day. Like it or not, the inability for the vendor to support our needs doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re off the hook. It still has to happen. We have no choice in that matter. I just hate always having to be on the end of doing the near-impossible. (Okay, <em>I&#8217;m</em> not doing the actual work, but people on my team are getting stuck with it. It&#8217;s the principle of the matter.)<br />
It&#8217;s funny how often we run into this sort of thing in marketing. I suppose that&#8217;s part-and-parcel of the job, right? I&#8217;d like to think that I&#8217;m not dishonest, and that if put in the opposite situation, that as a vendor I&#8217;d be completely cooperative and helpful.<br />
But maybe that&#8217;s just me&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Alex and I started off the morning with omelettes and <em>The Vinyl Cafe</em> on CBC Radio 2.<br />
We had decided to venture out to Banff for the day to do some Christmas shopping (well, mostly me &#8212; Alex is done and I simply haven&#8217;t had the time to start, and I&#8217;ve got family out east to contend with). The weather was a little chillier than we might prefer, but it was hardly a reason for us to stop.<br />
As we were doing up our shoes to head out, the radio still playing Stuart McLean, we heard him speak of what people did during the Christmas season in various cities across Canada. In Vancouver, it was Van Dusen&#8217;s gardens. In Toronto it was to see the displays in the Bay department store. In Calgary &#8230; you go to Banff.<br />
We just about died.<br />
The headwind out ruined any chance at fuel efficiency. But this was more about the venture out of town than anything else. Although there was the decided goal to ensure that we walked away with gifts, I was just content to get my butt out of the city and get away from my computer for a day.<br />
I felt rather guilty about this, I should add. I&#8217;ve got a team at the office breaking their necks to get us to a deadline for next Friday. I&#8217;ve done little actual work on the project thus far, as all of my input has been through guidance, adherence to standards, redirecting efforts, and coordinating items. Managerial crap, in other words. I feel bad because I&#8217;ve asked the world of the team, and they&#8217;ve delivered. The bane of no longer being a developer, I suppose&#8230;<br />
But I needed a day off. I&#8217;ve worked all but one day in November. One day off. I needed time out of the city to relax, even it was to do one of the more high-pressure things: Christmas shop. But shopping is something I like doing anyway, so I didn&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
After a quick bite at a cafe (a rather nice croquet of brie and ham), we ventured up and down Banff Ave. to find things for the family, near and far. Surprisingly enough, there wasn&#8217;t a tonne of people about, so it wasn&#8217;t really that bad a choice to drive out to Banff. Despite the 2.5 hour drive there and back, I think it was well worth the effort, since there were so few people about!<br />
Even better, the sales in Banff were better than in Calgary. Roots, for example, had a sale on fleece that was hard to pass up on. I even happened to run into Bill, Eryn, Scott, and Scott&#8217;s wife who were out for the day. It was the last place I expected to run into Critical Mass folk.<br />
Actually, not true &#8212; Ekaterinburg would be the last place. But then most of them have never heard of it anyway&#8230;<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay as long as I would have liked, though. Alex and Erin are going out for a concert tonight, so we had to leave around 16:30 to get back in time for Alex to get ready.<br />
We missed out on the hot springs (a near-tradition), and we didn&#8217;t get to laze around as much as we normally do. But it was good anyway. Something other than the house and the office was good for a change.<br />
&#8216;Cuz the week coming up is gonna be a tough one.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For the last week or so, my computer hasn&#8217;t been cooperating completely. Internet Explorer would suddenly cause the hard drive to chew away as it tried to start a JavaScript method of some kind. Then it wouldn&#8217;t run at all, crashing almost as soon as I tried to start it. Even loading email was difficult.<br />
Thankfully I know a few things about computers (especially the piece of garbage known as &#8220;Windows&#8221;) so was able to poke around and figure out what was going on. Well, <em>try</em> and figure out what was going on.<br />
A low-level disk scan revealed a number of bad clusters. They happen from time to time, usually as a result of shutting down a computer in the middle of an I/O write. One or two is not unexpected. Ten or more is a problem. Which is exactly what I found &#8212; about 15 of them. That struck me as being &#8220;bad&#8221;.<br />
It struck me as being more than just software at issue. It sounded like hardware. It sounded like a drive failure.<br />
I dislike jumping to the worst-case scenario when it comes to strange things on computer. I know there are a million things that could potentially go wrong before things go <em>really</em> wrong. But I seem to have almost a sixth sense for stuff like this.<br />
I first noticed it when I worked at Ark Computers back in high school. Back then, I was installing and supporting RLL and MFM hard drives. 30 megabytes. Big stuff for that time. Loud, too. Installing them meant using an obscure debug command to open the low-level formatter before you could even think about using fdisk to set up the drive. (I screwed up one of the original IDE drives because I low-level formatted it by accident.)<br />
Customers would bring their computers in thinking they weren&#8217;t behaving correctly, and I could tell just by listening that something was wrong. Generally, I was right, too. I could hear sounds that just &#8220;didn&#8217;t sound right&#8221;. It freaked out Rob, my boss. He couldn&#8217;t figure out how I did it. But I was right every time. Backed up the hard drive. Turned the computer off. Boom. Dead drive.<br />
I thought that years of not longer doing hardware support would dull and eventually kill the experience. Little did I know that it would remain. I was validated when just afternoon, I got the call: the hard drive needed to be replaced. It&#8217;s amazing how happy I was about the fact that my hard drive was dying. (Thankfully, not dead.)<br />
The bad part: It took me almost four hours to restore my files and settings from the old hard drive to the new. I&#8217;m going to be configuring this lousy thing for weeks to come&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It seems a lot of people (especially those at Microsoft) are constantly extolling all the virtues of the next Microsoft operating system to-be, Windows Vista.<br />
Am I really the only person who sees it as a dinosaur?<br />
Admittedly, I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of Microsoft software. I&#8217;ve dealt with Microsoft for far too long to trust pretty much anything they release. I have struggled with each and every piece of software they have ever released.<br />
Well, save for one: DOS.<br />
Mind you, operating systems were a lot simpler back then. They didn&#8217;t need to do much. They just needed to provide an environment in which things would work. But the problems with Vista started even back then. Remember the 640k barrier? The workarounds to use the higher memory?<br />
I&#8217;ll wager that the roots of DOS are still there. Sure, they rewrote the whole thing for Windows NT. But have you ever wondered why the requirements for the operating system keep getting larger and larger? Why you need more and more disk space to run it all? Windows XP is supposedly based on Windows NT (as was Server 2003), and I wonder how well all the changes are managed.<br />
It&#8217;s an operating system. It&#8217;s supposed to support everything else, not set an initial barrier to entry! There have been press releases about how powerful hardware needs to be in order to get the best experience out of Windows Vista. Any system bought within the last year is likely outta luck &#8212; you don&#8217;t have the juice. That just strikes me either as gloriously poor support for the user, or collusion with hardware vendors. Since when do you need a graphics accelerator to view a Word document?<br />
Okay, I exaggerate &#8212; it will run sans 64 MB of RAM on your video card &#8212; but the statement still seems to baffle the mind. Does Microsoft not think that perhaps there is need to rewrite from the ground up?<br />
Take the most successful operating system in recent years: UNIX. Not just Linux, but also Mac OSX. The kernel is small. No graphics. It runs. Add on only what you need to make things work. It runs nicely. There are releases of Linux out there that at a glance look like Microsoft Windows. Mac OSX is based (loosely) on the Mach kernel from the vaunted (and lamented) NeXTStep operating system. There&#8217;s a reason Macs run sooooo nicely, and it ain&#8217;t just the hardware.<br />
C&#8217;mon, Microsoft, if you hope to compete on the desktop space, you need to think much more carefully about your foundation. Crappy foundations lead to crappy experiences.</p>

		<p>[[All work and no play make Geoff something something|I used to drive.]]<br />
Then I realized that I should switch to something more environmentally friendly, and I could use the exercise to tone my otherwise sedentary ass. So I started biking.<br />
Biking was great. Fifteen minutes to work (mostly downhill), about 25 coming home (mostly uphill and in rush hour). Generally good. Except for the increase in leg mass that is causing issues with wearing pants (legs don&#8217;t fit anymore).<br />
It started getting darker (and colder). After a couple of near-misses with cars, I felt it was too dark to ride safely. So I switched to the bus.<br />
Makes sense &#8212; the #7 passes about a block from my house. Dumps me off about two blocks from the office. Runs every 15 minutes. You&#8217;d think that it would work well.<br />
Except that [[Calgary Transit Sucks]].<br />
And it kept getting worse. To the point where I was spending nearly two hours commuting. Driving takes 30 minutes.<br />
So I&#8217;m back to driving. There just seems no alternative.<br />
Damn.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the many joys of homeownership is the clogged kitchen sink. This is not my first clogged kitchen sink, [[Visit to Ontario, Clogged up Kitchen Sink Drain|having worked through such an experience with my father a number of years ago]].<br />
I should point out that the event did not make me an expert, just made me aware of what not to do.<br />
First thing not to do: pour sulphuric acid down the pipes, and hope that it somehow dissolves the gunk that&#8217;s down there. Even moreso: not to blow into the pipe in hopes of forcing it down, only to have it come back up to splash on your pants and dissolve the fabric while you&#8217;re still in them.<br />
Still, about two litres of Draino didn&#8217;t help. It poured in, but the drain didn&#8217;t really unclog. Finally, desperate measures were needed. Not a plumber &#8212; a snake.<br />
The snake is a long metal &#8230; um &#8230; well &#8230; thing. If you&#8217;ve seen one, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. If you haven&#8217;t, then I suggest a short trip to your nearest rental store to ask about one. It&#8217;s about the easiest thing I can think of.<br />
The snake was a 25 footer, which I hoped would be enough to find it&#8217;s way to the clog. I figured that the clog had to be at the drain stack, where the drain would ultimately head vertically into the sewer.<br />
A note about using a snake: Use gloves. Preferably ones you don&#8217;t care about. Because those snakes have been <em>everywhere</em> and they are <em>disgusting</em>. My hands were turned a greasy brown. I chose to believe it was actually grease, and not something else that you normally find down a drain. (At least it didn&#8217;t smell.)<br />
With a bit of help from Alex, we managed to get the sucker down the drain, find the clog, and poke a hole in its formerly impenetrable defenses to allow the drain to &#8230; well, drain.<br />
And I still have my pants!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in August, Alex and I celebrated our paper anniversary, the first. We&#8217;d celebrated by going to Banff and spending the night at the Banff Springs hotel, having a wonderful dinner (note: chocolate fondue is wonderful, but uncomfortably filling), and attending the Mozart on the Mountain concert in Canmore.<br />
As part of our paper anniversary, I gave Alex tickets (paper) to the next Cirque du Soliel show, called Delirium.<br />
We&#8217;ve seen Cirque before in Calgary, earlier when we were dating (see [[Stampede Breakfast, Topmade Barbecue, and Quidam]]). I&#8217;ve also seen Cirque in Vegas (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]) and a couple of other minor times (and off-shoot troupes) in and around Ontario. In short, there was no reason not to get good tickets the moment they went on sale.<br />
The kicker was that Alex knew that Cirque was coming, and kept bugging me to get tickets. I stalled repeatedly and played stupid (I do it rather well, admittedly; comes from being naturally idiotic) and managed to keep her unaware that the tickets were, in fact, already purchased. So when the time came, it was a wonderful little surprise.<br />
We had good seats. Not floor, but really darn close. Close enough that we could almost hear people on the stage (I thought I could, but given the clarity of the sound system it was sometimes hard to tell).<br />
It was a weird show, unlike any previous Cirque show I&#8217;ve seen. This could largely be due to Franco Dragoni having left to do his own thing, and his protégés having taken over. The stage was long and thin, with &#8220;backstages&#8221; on either end. The entire stage couldn&#8217;t have been more than about six metres wide. Each side could be &#8220;draped&#8221; with a long curtain, which was translucent. You could see through the curtains to the other side. This gave a more ethereal look and allowed for projection onto the stage environment.<br />
The show was far more musical than previous shows, and made even less sense than Cirque shows usually make. (Yes, it&#8217;s about the power of dream and imagination, a common theme, but I was still scratching my head to make out some sort of overall plot device.)<br />
The first act was a solo singer who performed with members of the Cirque troupe. It&#8217;s hard to pin down the style (other than being Cirque-like) using Gaelic and Arabic lyrics, by the sounds of it. Active, invigorating, and sold us on a CD during the intermission.<br />
The main show started shortly thereafter. Lots of acrobatics, drums, strange instruments, people hanging from the rafters and a weirdo on stilts (again, typically Cirque). The neat thing was all the video that is shown on the screens that drift across the stagefront every so often.<br />
But no clowns.<br />
Overall, totally worth the price of admission. I love Cirque du Soliel. They&#8217;re always worth watching, even if it&#8217;s not one of their big, extravagant Vegas shows.<br />
Hmm. Which reminds me. I do need to revisit Vegas sometime to catch the other shows I haven&#8217;t seen&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve used video conferencing before. It was a novelty. Nothing fancy. There, but didn&#8217;t think much of it.<br />
Until today.<br />
Critical Mass recently got a Polycom video conferencing unit in the Calgary office. (There are matching units in Chicago and Toronto.) We&#8217;ve started using it with my current client for the weekly status meetings.<br />
The client is in Geneva. The video conference makes them seem like they&#8217;re in the same room.<br />
It&#8217;s trippy. It&#8217;s not the best quality and the lag is a little weird, but you get to see everything. Every facial movement (well, that the resolution lets you see, anyway), the mannerisms, everything. And because you can see yourself, it&#8217;s also makes you very self-conscious. Also trippy.<br />
Our client is eight time zones and over 12 hours of flying away. And our one hour of overlap a day keeps us somehow connected over a simple IP-based video connection.<br />
Technology really does make a difference at times.</p>

		<p>I had a quick jaunt out to Ruskin (a section of Maple Ridge, BC) for the Thanksgiving weekend. It was a trip I wasn&#8217;t sure I was going to be able to take at first. Reason: Too much work, and too tight deadlines to allow it.<br />
Deadlines changed. Whether they changed for the better remains to be seen&#8230;<br />

		<p>Space. The Final Frontier.<br />
Forty years ago today, a little under six years before I was born, Star Trek took to the air for it&#8217;s original three-year run before being cancelled. It would spawn off an animated series, comic book series, toys, four spin-off television series, 10 movies, and more parodies than you could shake a tribble at.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t know the first time I watched Star Trek in any form, though I&#8217;m relatively sure it was TOS (The Original Series). I know I was an addict for the entire run of TNG (The Next Generation). From there, I progressed to DS9 (Deep Space 9), Voyager, and finally the too-short-lived Enterprise series. Following TNG, my addition tempered and waned, especially as many of the episodes seemed to have lacklustre writing and stints of not-so-great acting. (Yes, it can be argued that none of the series had great acting as a whole. Particularly when it comes to asking what &#8230; have you done &#8230; with &#8230; Spock&#8217;s brain?!)<br />
&#8220;Trekkie.&#8221; The word evokes four possible responses: Laughter, ignorance, revulsion, acceptance. Some know what a trekkie is and merely laugh at the idea. There are those who have no idea what a trekkie is. There are those who do know and thoroughly object to being considered a &#8220;trekkie&#8221;, staunchly preferring &#8220;trekker&#8221;. And there are those who like the idea (and the connotations) that come with the epithet.<br />
I was a trekkie. (Note the past-tense.) I considered those who wanted to be called &#8220;trekkers&#8221; to be far too pretentious for their own good. I was all for the campiness, the humour, the perceived silliness that comes out. I went to Star Trek conventions (two, to be exact &#8212; one in Toronto and another in Buffalo). I had the pins, knew most of the characters, all the TNG episodes, could recite most of The Wrath of Khan by heart. And I wasn&#8217;t ashamed about it, either.<br />
Somewhere along the line &#8212; once I&#8217;d graduated university, it seems &#8212; I&#8217;d began a long, slow decline in my trekkiness. Today, I&#8217;d consider myself having turned my card back, no longer allowed to consider myself one amongst the crowd. &#8220;Reformed&#8221;, &#8220;ex&#8221;, &#8220;former&#8221; &#8212; pick a euphimism. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still love Star Trek in its various forms (although Voyager&#8217;s &#8220;reset button&#8221; habit still ticks me off), I just don&#8217;t devote a significant portion of my brain to it anymore. I&#8217;ve got a variety of other things to cram in there.<br />
Like generally useless trivia. It&#8217;s part of being a know-it-all.<br />
But you have to give Star Trek something. Despite all the wacky behaviour with fanatics, the show has done a surprising amount of good. Well, maybe &#8220;good&#8221; is subjective. It breathed life into the entire nearly-dead science fiction genre and gave rise to Star Wars, among other things. It also kindled new interest in science itself, creating several generations of scientists, physicists, explorers, and astronomers.<br />
The creator is gone. Gene Roddenbury died when I was in university. DeForrest &#8220;Bones&#8221; Kelly followed a few years later. James &#8220;Scotty&#8221; Doohan passed into the final frontier last year. Forty years takes its toll. They may be gone, but the legacy will live on. Maybe even to the 23rd century.<br />
Live long, and prosper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A year ago, I got married. Something that until a couple of years ago, I never thought I&#8217;d do. I&#8217;d been bitten hard, and I couldn&#8217;t do it. Couldn&#8217;t even imagine it. It takes the right person, and the right situation, to make something like marriage seem feasible, even exciting. And until a couple of years ago, I don&#8217;t think I was even mentally ready for it. It&#8217;s a big commitment, one that many people don&#8217;t really appreciate. It&#8217;s just a &#8220;thing to do&#8221;. Witness the divorce rate&#8230;<br />
Today is the first anniversary. We&#8217;ll be going to Mozart in the Mountain, the first concert of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s season. (Obviously, I&#8217;m writing this entry in advance.) I&#8217;m also arranging a night at the Banff Springs Hotel as a sort of celebration. Hopefully it all goes well. But this entry isn&#8217;t about this year&#8217;s anniversary. I want to tell you a story about my wedding, and how things don&#8217;t always go as planned. To set the stage, I give you two words:<br />
Food poisoning.<br />
This all started on the Tuesday before, 23 August 2005. Exactly how, I can&#8217;t tell you. Not because I don&#8217;t want to, but because I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve talked about this endlessly trying to figure out exactly what happened. All I do know is that I ingested <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter">Campylobacter jejuni</a></em>, a rather nasty gut bug that takes a few days to incubate and do its thing. There are a couple of possibilities, but nothing that I would consider conclusive. When when you&#8217;re &#8220;best friend&#8221; happens to be Murphy, you know that it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; you were going to get it anyway.<br />
Skip ahead to Friday, the 26th. My friends Stuart and Therese were in town for the wedding with their daughter, and we&#8217;d all gone out to Chilliwack to have dinner with my family at a cabin they&#8217;d rented. Clams, mussels, and steak. At the time, we were waiting for news of Teak picking Chris up from the airport (having flown in from Japan) and we would all meet at the Mission Best Western, where Therese and Stuart were staying.<br />
It took a while for Chris and Teak to get back. Teak took a few wrong turns in Vancouver (which is very easy if you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going) and they ended up having to stop for dinner along the way. Stuart and I ended up waiting in the hotel&#8217;s restaurant/bar (Therese baby-sat, under the intention of swapping with Stuart once Chris arrived).<br />
Around 23:15, I decided it might be necessary to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;d only had 1/2 of a bottle of beer, though plenty other liquids (I had a bit of a headache, but nothing I&#8217;d consider bad). When I stood up, I knew something was wrong. There was that twinge of nausea that suggested something was amiss, and I <em>really</em> needed to go to the bathroom.<br />
When Chris and Teak finally arrived just after midnight, my head was swimming. I couldn&#8217;t see straight without a lot of effort. There was no way I was going back to Chilliwack that evening (I was supposed to stay with my family). I begged Teak and Chris to crash in their hotel room. I managed to (somehow) drive back to their place in Maple Ridge (about 20 minutes) without causing an accident. I pulled out my sleeping back, curled up on the floor, and proceeded to suffer a tired, awkward, sweaty, and painful half-sleep until my alarm went off at 7:00 the next morning.<br />
By that point, I&#8217;d made a few trips to the bathroom. None of them were to vomit, thankfully, but every trip just reinforced that something was wrong. Teak&#8217;s Advil didn&#8217;t bring much relief. The pressure of the things that needed to be done before 13:00 however, allowed me to concentrate on other things. That, and a stop to the 7-11 along the way to pick up Gatorade seemed to help a bit.<br />
While Alex was getting her hair done (I hadn&#8217;t seen her since early-afternoon the day before), I ran around setting up tables, arranging placements, getting chairs into their locations. Teak and Chris had graciously loaned me their time to help decorating, though we didn&#8217;t really need a lot of it. Mostly just to hide the rather unattractive corners of the tent.<br />
An early-morning call to the bakery had discovered that our order for cupcakes would be ready for 15:00 &#8230; two hours <em>after</em> when we actually needed them. My head still swimming, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to hear that, and strongly suggested that they recheck their schedule, as I was to pick them up around 11:00, and I could only afford the trip into Abbotsford once. After a few minutes of discussion, they assured me it would be ready on time.<br />
My gut started to feel a little like a saltwater taffy puller. Things were moving, and it wasn&#8217;t comfortable. I hadn&#8217;t eaten much to speak of, but hunger was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted was to have the day go off without a hitch. While Chris and Teak toiled away with their decorating, I headed to the bakery to get our cupcakes.<br />
By the time I&#8217;d arrived back, guests were already in attendance. I was in grubby clothes, unwashed hair and unshaven. Not to mention feeling wholly gross from the exploding infection in my bowels. And to top it all off, the two wait staff that we&#8217;d hired promptly asked where they could find the ice.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten the ice.<br />
After the fastest trip yet seen from the house to the corner store and back, I retreated to the basement to try and get ready. I figured a hot shower would help. All it did was call out to the dull ache in my lower back. The shave was like scraping nerve endings. I looked like I hadn&#8217;t slept in a week. I suited up nonetheless, determined not to let some lousy, stupid illness put an end to something that we&#8217;d been planning for months. Ache or no ache, the show had to go on.<br />
Everyone seemed to notice immediately that I wasn&#8217;t feeling up to scratch. But most people &#8212; including my lovely wife-to-be &#8212; were convinced that it was only &#8220;nerves&#8221;. I humoured them and went along with it, but knowing full well the difference between nerves and illness. For the most part, it wasn&#8217;t too bad, I was able to work with what we had, mingling and wandering around, before we actually went into wedding mode. Tie and jacket added, we started the service.<br />
Like most things in our wedding, it was largely unplanned. We had an approximate idea of what we needed, but we didn&#8217;t rehearse (no need to) and didn&#8217;t know how long it would take Paul to go through the speeches. In reality, I have no idea how long the service actually went. All I do know is that the shoes (new) combined with a lot of standing and the seemingly full-on assault to my inner abdomen was wreaking havoc with my back. Spasms periodically shook through my spine and it was everything to bite my tongue and tell Paul to move it along a bit quicker.<br />
To this day, Alex still says I didn&#8217;t enjoy my day. It wasn&#8217;t that I hated it, far from it &#8212; weddings are meant to be wonderful days, and we&#8217;d planned ours in that way on purpose. But I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as her. I couldn&#8217;t eat. I couldn&#8217;t drink. I couldn&#8217;t think clearly. I didn&#8217;t get to partake of all the mingling that I&#8217;d wanted to. Taking the photographs afterwards was almost torture. I looked for every opportunity to sit down. In fact, one of my favourite pictures of us was when we were seated, and I was resting my head on Alex&#8217;s shoulder from sheer exhaustion. It looks angelic in print, even if it belies the torture going on underneath.<br />
The lack of clarity of thought really cut out a few things that I would have liked to do, namely get pictures of myself with those in attendance. As such, we have very little with those who came from afar. It&#8217;s my only regret of the day. The event wrapped up around 18:00 with people heading out into the evening. When most people had left, I headed back downstairs to get myself out of my suit and into something that felt less restrictive. The bed in the room I was changing in looked so inviting that I just couldn&#8217;t resist laying down for a moment.<br />
Alex found me there, passed out. When I awoke, the room spun in wild circles, like a midway ride gone wrong. I had to shut them almost immediately to prevent nausea. Alex let me rest another 30 minutes before we left for our hotel room in Langley. The trip there was hell. Every bump in the road sent pains up my body. Even the cool breeze didn&#8217;t help to clear anything. A card that Chris gave me sent me bawling from emotional overload. Though only a 30-minute trip, even 30 seconds was too long to get there.<br />
The running joke of the wedding night is this: hot and sweaty, without a lot of sleep. And that was just me.<br />
Despite a hot bath and almost having to call the biohazard disposal team from what had escaped from me (again, no vomiting), I still fired up the furnace of illness, actually forcing Alex to sleep at the far edge of the bed from me. It was too hot, even for her. The opposing chills that came were equally intolerable.<br />
The next morning I actually felt marginally better. I ate for the first time in almost a day and a half &#8212; a carrot muffin &#8212; before we headed out for our honeymoon. The idea had originally been to drive to Fairmont, a drive of about nine hours. But that had been scrapped even before my illness, when we realized that it was just unrealistic. Revelstoke seemed much better for our first leg. But even though I felt good enough to drive, we didn&#8217;t even make it as far as the Coquihalla Toll Booth. My system was going down again. Thirty minutes from Kamloops, my hips felt like they were imploding, my legs wouldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
They say married men live longer than single men. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re married, it&#8217;s because single men don&#8217;t have someone to force them to go to hospital when something&#8217;s wrong.<br />
For the record, the Royal Inland Hospital is a very nice facility that offers some really decent healthcare. They triaged me right away, including a bracelet and a urine test. I had to wait only a few minutes to get a bed, my own heart monitor (and blood oxygen monitor), and a nurse that checked in on me to get more information about how I was feeling. Alex was more distracted by all the gadgets in the curtained area than about me at this point &#8212; the problems with marrying someone in the health care industry&#8230;<br />
The trouble really came when the doctor came in. A decent fellow, he thought maybe the shellfish could be culprit, but he seemed doubtful. He carried out a conversation fairly nonchalantly, repeating most of the same topics the nurse had covered not long before. He was so smooth about it that he almost managed to get me to miss the blood test and IV he wanted to put me on.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already heard, I don&#8217;t like needles. I hate them. Loathe them. Despise them. And now he wanted to put something in me not for a few moments, but a few <em>hours</em> to &#8230; do something (I didn&#8217;t ask what). I immediately started reacting by suggesting that there must be some other way. The doctor, wisely, looked at my new wife for support. She just looked at me, smiled, and softly said: &#8220;Suck it up, buttercup!&#8221;<br />
For the record, it was the best thing that could happen. Blood tests ain&#8217;t my thing, and while I didn&#8217;t dig the IV (having to take it down the hall to the toilet to deliver the ol&#8217; poop-in-a-hat test was something I never thought I&#8217;d have to do one day), I felt immeasurably better for having taken the two litres of saline. The majority of my issues were due to dehydration, and this was the best way to get me back on track.<br />
The doctor also informed us that the bacterial infection could potentially spread through body fluids, so we had to keep our respective distance for a few days. On our honeymoon, no less. The ultimate torture for newlyweds. But at least the cramping was gone and I didn&#8217;t have any relapses. It wasn&#8217;t until I got back to Calgary that I found out what I&#8217;d actually had (not the shellfish, that much was certain). Source unknown, but culprit found.<br />
One day, down the road, we&#8217;ll probably get remarried. Something fun, simple, and easy. And hopefully free of nasty bacteria.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Sigh.</em><br />
Just when I thought <a href="http://www.decloak.com/Dev/CSSTables/CSS_Tables_01.aspx">this topic was in the past</a>, to be revisited in the same manner as when historians look at how the Black Plague ravaged Europe. But no, it&#8217;s back. I&#8217;ve had to don my somewhat dusty Web Practice Lead hat at Critical Mass to once again defend the faith from tyranny and the inequities of evil men. (Sorry, sudden <em>Pulp Fiction</em> flashback.) That should read to defend against ignorance. But I digress&#8230;<br />
There has been a slight push in the industry over the last few months to return to using tables for web page layouts, rather than the industry standard CSS presentation. Keeping our finger on the pulse of the industry, many of us at Critical Mass have seen the arguments. Some even begin to question our own direction.<br />
This is a good thing, by the way. I want those questions. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> once said, the most dangerous phrase in the language is: &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it this way.&#8221; Bring the arguments. Bring the discussion. Just come armed and educated.<br />
The movement back to tables is an uneducated position. Despite all the arguments for the movement, the one thing it seems to be ignoring is why the W3C standards exist. They&#8217;re not there because a few people thought it was a good idea. They&#8217;re there because a group of people far more educated than I spent the time to figure out what the best method would be.<br />
Yes, CSS is complicated. I will completely agree that in many ways, CSS is far too cumbersome for most developers. I will be among the first to stand up and say that support is not complete and correct. I&#8217;ll gladly point fingers at Microsoft&#8217;s regular aberrant behaviour. CSS is not perfect, and anyone who uses it with any depth will come to realize that there are issues with CSS&#8217;s specification (never mind the often haphazard way the browsers implement the specification).<br />
BUT<br />
Critical Mass does not represent most developers. We have gone beyond what most developers contend with. Our interfaces are richer and more engaging than the majority of designs out there. We deal with clients who expect results better than middle-of-the-road, and that&#8217;s what will drive us to use the right technology for the right reasons.<br />
As strange as it sounds, we work towards segregation: separation of content, presentation, functionality, and structure. This isn&#8217;t just the W3C standard &#8212; this is common sense. Anyone striving to do proper development, in <em>any</em> language, should be doing this. If you tie the structure to presentation, you&#8217;re going to have a fun time making edits when that presentation changes. I&#8217;ve seen this happen hundreds of times before. Veterans in this industry can tell you horror stories of having to change the structure of a website across a thousand files, a tedious task that took weeks. Yes, this can be automated, but the connection is the point &#8212; it should <strong>never</strong> occur.<br />
In this article, they split CSS into CSS and CSS-P. This is an interesting, albeit incorrect direction. Critical Mass (as well as most decent developers) adhere to CSS 2.1, which doesn&#8217;t break down into two parts. It&#8217;s <strong>one</strong> standard that happens to cover the appearance of fonts and colours, and handle the layout of a page. And that&#8217;s what people need to understand.<br />
This requires an understanding of CSS beyond how to use CSS for fonts. From a hiring perspective, we do require that all new hires have an understanding of CSS. While we do not require skills along the lines of Jason Santa Maria, Dave Shea, or Dan Cederholm, although it&#8217;s very cool when someone comes in the door who writes great CSS. We do want to see people laying out pages in CSS, even if it&#8217;s rudimentary and potentially awkward. Only with that understanding can people learn.<br />
When people cry that &#8220;tables are the only way to go&#8221; for websites, they have given up on the standards and all the benefits that come along with them. They have opted to cut themselves short on skills and knowledge and allow the site to suffer long-term. I cannot accept that anyone would willingly throw in the towel to lose out on the flexibility of using CSS over the rigidity of tables.<br />
Arguments such as speed, ROI, tables already being in databases, and standards that are too heavy are grossly uninformed. Speed is pointless because any sufficiently complicated design will necessarily have a sufficiently complicated table &#8212; and that&#8217;s easily larger than using CSS because you have to download the table on every single page. CSS downloads once. ROI is self-defeating because most people only look at the development phase and neglect the far more costly maintenance phase. Well-developed CSS will always allow for faster (hence, cheaper) maintenance. Yes, tables are in a database &#8230; and if that&#8217;s your argument, you&#8217;ve completely misunderstood the need to separate systems. And that&#8217;s not a discussion I&#8217;m getting into now.<br />
It&#8217;s the flexibility that we want. CSS can change quickly (assuming you&#8217;ve architected your CSS appropriately) and the same structure can be reformatted with many CSS files. I challenge anyone to show me how to do CSS Zen Garden in tables. And remember, any sufficiently powerful tool is by its own nature more complicated &#8212; simple isn&#8217;t always better.<br />
All of that said, I do have a concession&#8230;<br />
Despite the need to follow standards (knowing why we use them), there is an overriding condition that we must be aware of at all times: We have to follow budgets. And if something is too difficult to do in CSS, we will build it with tables.<br />
Though I will immediately point out (should this condition arise) that if you are going to tables because it won&#8217;t work with CSS, that I would question the reasons why. If it&#8217;s an infamiliarity with the technology, then more practice might be required. Or that the CSS is already too complex, and there&#8217;s a cascade problem. Specificity is important, and the key is to know when to use global settings and when to use specific references.<br />
And of course, we should ALWAYS use tables for tabular data. But you already know that.<br />
So why is this coming up? Why is there the movement back? In a word: AJAX (oh, how I hate that acronym). The last time we had a major buzzword in the Web Development field, it was DHTML. It&#8217;s equally as annoying as AJAX because it caused everyone to think a new technology existed. (In both cases, it&#8217;s just promoting something that already exists in a novel way.) The buzz has had a positive spin, forcing a lot of previously less-skilled developers to need to learn the standards to implement AJAX correctly. The speed at which people have had to learn is a concern, and those having trouble with CSS are running back to tables.<br />
To those people: slow down. Don&#8217;t panic. The solution is there, you just need to spend some time and play a bit with CSS. Maybe you need to do it at home. If you think CSS isn&#8217;t worth the time and effort, you really need to think about how you&#8217;re approaching your project. I know from my own experience that tables are a dead-end. And if you talk to the best developers in the field, tables are <em>only</em> good for presenting tabular data. Long live CSS.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a tough person. I don&#8217;t settle for mediocrity in my own work, or in the work of those who work with me. There are the minimum height bars, and then there are the ones I set. Knee-capping height, some even high enough to deliver serious abdominal or even cranial damage if you&#8217;re not careful. Normally, I subject only myself to these standards, and beat myself up when I don&#8217;t achieve them. But as I&#8217;m also a manager, they do creep into others&#8217; reviews.<br />
In 2005, I think many people thought I was an outright ass for marking people as hard as I did. I gave &#8220;average&#8221; marks to otherwise outstanding people who made one or two mistakes. I considered them serious mistakes. Not ones that would get people fired, but ones that I really felt needed direct attention. There were repercussions to myself though, and I was brought to task for those marks. Not for the marks themselves, but for the way it was communicated. How are people to know what they&#8217;re being evaluated against?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Chris arrived on Sunday afternoon. The surprise went down on Sunday night. While over dinner, someone wondered if we were going to have a game night.<br />
Dummy me, I&#8217;d never thought of that.<br />
Years ago, when Chris and I used to live downtown, we used to have game nights. We bought a Sega Dreamcast and a Sony Playstation 2. We don&#8217;t have a lot of games, but the ones we do have were good for getting people together and playing against each other. Most of the games we have are Japanese &#8212; ones you can&#8217;t get in North America. (You can&#8217;t get them at all now, but even when they were on the market, they weren&#8217;t sold in North America.) Games such as Rival Schools and Powerstone 2. Then there&#8217;s the heavy duty fighting games like Soul Calibur.<br />
None of these I particularly like. I&#8217;m not a fighting game sort of person. I&#8217;ve generally prefered single-player games. (Yes, you can joke about this all you want.) Gimme the old-school games like Doom and Quake, and more recent ones like Grand Theft Auto. Mano-a-mano scenarios never really appeal to me too much. MMORGs like World of Warcraft are ones I tend to avoid.<br />
The nights were almost legendary. Fifteen, maybe twenty people all crammed into our living room, jostling each other, taking turns in the trash talk and game play. We&#8217;d start after work on Fridays, and the action would go on until early in the morning. We were loud. Very loud. I&#8217;m amazed to this day that we never once got a noise complaint &#8212; or the cops showing up at our door.<br />
Thankfully, a basement in a detached house is a lot more soundproof than even a concrete apartment. Even if the room is a lot smaller.<br />
For a brief moment, it was like old times. Different place, but the old same faces, the old same habits. Most of the skills had gone rusty over the years, and indeed different people won than could have won four and a quarter years ago. It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s actually been that long, that long since the Asian Brother Crew got together in such merriment. A reminder that things change and time passes. It&#8217;s saddening and happy at the same time.<br />
Pizza. Fresh-baked oatmeal and butterscotch-chip cookies. Potato chip flavours we would never normally think of eating. Round robin matches, with much victory and loss. Some games that would no longer load (ages defeats us all, it seems).<br />
Virgil left shortly after dinner. The others held out for much longer, but it was a school night, and people were due to leave before too long. The gaming slowed, and the waves of departure began. Two people here, three people there. Soon, it was just Chris, Kaz, Alex, and myself.<br />
I slept poorly. It was over. As I had thought would happen &#8212; I blinked, and the time passed.<br />
This morning, I gathered myself to go to work. Chris and Kaz met me at the door as I prepared to leave. I hate saying goodbye. But I had to go to work, I had a scheduled client call at the time I would normally have taken them to the airport. Ironically, the call was cancelled.<br />
Chris is on his way back to Japan. With luck, our paths might cross again next year. But it will be increasingly more difficult for this to happen. Though I really want to go back to Japan, I&#8217;m not sure when that might happen again.<br />
But it will happen. That I am sure of.<br />

		<p>I was having a discussion with Doug down in the Bistro this morning, and I came to a rather interesting realization: Calgary Transit sucks.<br />
Let&#8217;s have a realistic view, here. Calgary is the third or fourth largest city in Canada. We&#8217;re over a million people (we recently had our one millionth baby, but I suspect we&#8217;re actually well over that number in population). We have a massive city by area because Calgary hasn&#8217;t quite figured out that we should be building up, not out.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Two major things happened this weekend. My friend Chris came to town for a visit! But more on that in a moment&#8230;<br />
Gary and I had grandiose plans about setting up a dragon boat team at the office. But the plans never materialized (we simply forgot) and due to a reshuffling within the Topmade Dragon Boat Club, the team I was on last year was not rostered this year. I was left teamless, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on signing onto a new one. So no dragon boating for me this year. That didn&#8217;t stop Alex and I from biking down to the North Glenmore Park to drop in on the festival this weekend and see how it was going.<br />
We arrived just after noon, and immediately noticed something. We were spectators. Amazingly obvious, I know, but there&#8217;s an important point to that: no adrenaline. It was almost boring. There was nothing to keep us truly interested. We chatted with Colette, who was revelling in her team&#8217;s 2:06 time (one of the fastest that day); we watched a couple of races (and watched Arnold, our former coach, guide a team whose boat capsized back to shore), and wandered through the thin array of shops before heading out.<br />
[photopress:_mg_4509.jpg,thumb,pp_image][photopress:_mg_4510.jpg,thumb,pp_image][photopress:_mg_4515.jpg,thumb,pp_image][photopress:_mg_4521.jpg,thumb,pp_image][photopress:_mg_4526.jpg,thumb,pp_image]<br />
Our primary goal was actually the Glenmore Reservoir. Or more importantly, biking around it. I had always thought that the reservoir was a joke &#8212; it&#8217;s a small lake, and something that one could do in about 20 minutes. Not worth the time. Or so I thought.<br />
You have to go west from North Glenmore Park over to the Weaselhead Flats, where the trail goes right through the nature preserve there, crossing the Elbow River. Then around the south side of the lake through stands of birch and tamarack trees, skirting the edge of the Tsuu T&#8217;ina nation, which occupies the southwest corner of Calgary.<br />
The whole time, we were trying to avoid getting rained on. As is typical of Calgary, the formerly sunny day had shifted very quickly to cold and rainy. We got to the Good Earth Cafe in Glenmore Landing before we got too wet, thankfully. Emerging as the rain passed, we continued through Heritage Park and up to Rockyview Hospital. There we could see the dragon boat races from a distance. We arrived in time to see the 1,000 mixed race. I shuddered at the thought of having to run that long. Sang and Mark had joked that we should join them for the race.<br />
The next day was marked by a breakfast at the Calgary Farmers Market, a glorious five-minute walk from our home. We stocked up on food in preparation for our houseguests, arriving that afternoon. After a quick wipedown at home, we headed up to Marda Gras, a nearby street festival. We stayed long enough for a pass up and down before running to the car and off to the airport.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t hard to find Chris, despite all the people waiting for AC 173&#8217;s bags to appear on the barrage carousel. (Calgary Airport is getting slower and slower every day, I swear.) He&#8217;s the only black man in Calgary at the moment, I think. Kaz was a bit harder to spot &#8212; she blends in better, but Chris managed to point her out to us.<br />
Chris and Kaz&#8217;s arrival was a secret. Only Teak, Jordon, Alex, and I knew that they were here. Chris wanted to surprise the Asian Brother Crew, the group that used to all hang out in our apartment downtown. The plan was to have everyone gather at Silver Dragon. Teak had been egging the group on all week about an &#8220;important announcement&#8221;, which everyone wanted to hear. (The speculation, which I helped fuel, was that Teak was getting married, or even more of a shocker, had gotten a girl pregnant.) It was all part of the fun.<br />
We arrived very late &#8212; 30 minutes after the prescribed time. Alex and I took our seats at the table, and Teak went into a prepared speech. Chris and Kaz waited two minutes downstairs before making their appearance. Teak went through his schtick too quickly, and had to adlib until Chris and Kaz appeared. Half the table shrieked. The other half feined surprise. Tamara cried. It was a great reaction.<br />
And we ate way too much.<br />
Chris isn&#8217;t here long, just until Thursday morning. Three and a half days. And I&#8217;m not going to see him much because I have to work. I&#8217;m going to blink and he&#8217;ll be gone again. It&#8217;s hard seeing your friends for such a short time, especially when they&#8217;re coming from such a distance. We&#8217;ve managed to see each other every year for the last four years. I don&#8217;t know what next year will bring, but I suspect it&#8217;ll be a long while before I see him again.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been using PC-based computers for 25 years. A quarter-century. And things have come such a long distance since I first sat in front of that IBM in Mom&#8217;s office. This has all come to light as a result of an article I came across in <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,1-c,systems/article.html">PC World about the 25 Top PC Computers</a>, as a way of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first IBM PC.<br />
I had been introduced to computers at an early age &#8212; the Commodore PET and the Apple II in the late 1970s. Several friends had Commodore VIC-20s and 64s. The concept of computers was hardly unfamiliar, but the matte beige and grey box before me was &#8230; unusual.<br />
First off, it was big. Really big. Most of the computers I&#8217;d seen at that point (save for the PET) were little more than keyboards, visually-speaking. This had a keyboard, a monitor, and a big, strange box that you had to turn on and off. By today&#8217;s standards, it was little more than a glorified calculator:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM Personal Computer, Model 5150</li>
<li>4.77 MHz Intel 8088 Microprocessor</li>
<li>Green monochrome monitor, text-only</li>
<li>128k RAM</li>
<li>2 x 360k single-sided 5.25&#8243; disk drives</li>
<li>Wide carriage Epson 9-pin dot matrix printer</li>
</ul>
<p>For the record, it wasn&#8217;t <em>my</em> computer. It was owned by my mom&#8217;s employer, who wanted her to use it for bookkeeping. But the PeachTree software she had to use was so cumbersome and difficult that the computer gathered dust for the longest time until I got around to using it. It wasn&#8217;t the easiest computer to use, either. You had to boot off of floppy disks, and regularly had to change disks to load software. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to flip the disks over, as some systems required back then.<br />
I taught myself DOS 1.1, which was the only operating system I had. BASICA (BASIC Advanced) was also provided in a separate manual (though the program was on the DOS disk). I read the manual, looked at the sample programs, and taught myself BASIC. I wrote a number of programs, including what could technically qualify as a database (long before I knew what a database was). It stored all the statistics of my Transformers.<br />
I used the system for years, writing my essays on an early version of WordStar, but I couldn&#8217;t really do a whole lot. Without any graphics to speak of, I was always behind my friends who were playing &#8220;Impossible Mission&#8221;.<br />
Curiousity, a common thread through my life, got the better of me and I pulled the cover off one day. Inside was a mess of stuff that made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. I didn&#8217;t know what a single thing was in there, except the obvious stuff (power supply and disk drives).<br />
One summer, my dad got me a job working as a general labourer in the shop at his company. In the office was a IBM PS/2. It had a 30 MB hard drive, which I&#8217;d never encountered before. Despite some mocking by the other guys in the shop (they&#8217;d mash on the keyboards and claim they were &#8220;computer experts&#8221;), I learned how to create and manage directories. Which prepared me for my next computer.<br />
Convincing my parents to do this wasn&#8217;t easy, but they eventually gave in and bought me my high school computer science teacher&#8217;s old IBM-compatible XT computer. Faster than the IBM, and had four different colours to use! Most importantly, it had a hard drive. A huge one, by the standards of the day, and I was able to start doing more advanced things, playing actual games, and seeing pictures (sort of).<br />
Before too long, the lack of colour got to me and I really needed to get something better. A new video card, with a whopping 256 colours! So I went downtown to a place called Ark Computer Systems and bought myself a handy video card which I was told &#8220;should work&#8221;. It would seem that the trusty XT was too old. The card wouldn&#8217;t work. Admittedly, my computer diagnostic skills were fairly weak at the time, so I was hardly an expert at fixing it. I went back to the store to see if they could help. Ultimately, I needed a more expensive card because it overrode the computer&#8217;s BIOS with its own to provide the video. I had more colour!<br />
And little did I know, I also had a reputation. When I entered the co-operative education program in Grade 12, the school arranged an interview for me with a local computer company. Ark Computer Systems. When I walked into the store for my job interview, I was told: &#8220;Take the tie off, the job&#8217;s yours.&#8221; That day I was installing an RLL hard drive using the low-level formatter built into the hard drive controller, accessible using a little-known debug command. (IDE drives, which came a couple of years later, took all the fun out of having to do the grunt work to set up hard drives.)<br />
Over the next couple of years, I came to be the primary tech, fixing virtually everything and anything that came into the store. I got so good at one point that I could tell when a hard drive was about to fail just by listening to it. I couldn&#8217;t sell computers worth a damn, but fixing them wasn&#8217;t a problem.<br />
I ended up with a 386SX from there &#8212; a prototype that we&#8217;d gotten in to try and win a large contract with an agency of some kind. 16-bit colour, an 80 MB hard drive, and a whopping 8 MB of RAM. (Hey, it was the late 1980s &#8212; I was pushing boundaries with that!)<br />
All that experience landed me a co-op job with Digital Equipment Corporation (formerly the #2 computer company after IBM, now a forgotten memory bought up by Compaq and pretty much disassembled), doing user support. The money paid for university and my next computer: a 486 tower. My first CD-ROM drive. A 100 MB Seagate Barracuda SCSI hard drive (which failed a few years later, much to my chagrin).<br />
I worked at a computer store in my last year of university, earning enough to pay rent and food. I worked there a bit too much though, burning out in my final months. Another computer here, a first-generation Penitum. More RAM, more disk space.<br />
My first job in Toronto put me working a lot of hours, partly because I didn&#8217;t know any better and was determined to prove myself. To whom, I don&#8217;t know, but it still made me work a lot. And it led me to the worst computer purchase I&#8217;ve ever made: a Gateway Solo 2100. Boat anchor. I spent almost as much time talking with Gateway tech support to get the stupid thing fixed as I did using it. Ironically enough, I still have the thing (a 66 MHz Pentium). I have no idea why.<br />
Radical Entertainment was a great place for hardware. One advantage of being a videogame company: you get all the latest hardware to play around with. My actual work computer was okay (a Dell, as I recall), but the latest AMD systems were on a test bench. My job: get the latest and greatest for the developers to play with. We drooled over AMD K7 chip. We could literally feel the power when we turned it on.<br />
I&#8217;ve gone through a number of computers since then: one at home and three at the office. My current system is a Dell Lattitude D620. If this sucker existed 25 years ago, I&#8217;m sure it would have put my friends on their fancy Commodore 64s into apopelptic shock. Dual core Penitum 2.4 GHz with 2 GB of RAM and a 80 GB hard drive, full 32-bit colour with dual monitor support, wireless internet connectivity, and a DVD-RW drive.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how much computers have changed over the last 25 years. And Moore&#8217;s Law is still holding out, despite a lot of belief that eventually it&#8217;ll have to finally give out. Given that 25 years ago we couldn&#8217;t imagine the computers we&#8217;d have today, it&#8217;s hard to imagine what we&#8217;ll see 25 years from now.</p>

		<p>When did society become responsible for the stupidity of individuals?<br />
Over the last few years, there&#8217;s been a disturbing trend where corporations (and governments, through the courts) have had to start protecting the stupid. Not the mentally disabled &#8212; the stupid. Seemingly ordinary people that, on the surface, you&#8217;d probably never suspect of being a moron. And yet, these people are the ones who end up affecting the rest of us because they feel they were specifically picked upon and justified in their retribution.<br />
What am I referring to? Cold coffee. Quiet iPods. Notices of the blatantly obvious.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The flight left Charles du Gaulle at 11:30. That meant, of course, that I had to be there in sufficient time to check in, get through security, find the flight, and so forth.<br />
Thankfully, I&#8217;d gone through the trouble last night of finding the RER station at Chatelet-les-Halles. As is turns out, it&#8217;s a weird sort of situation. Chatelet is the Metro station. Les Halles is an ex-market area. Chatelet-les-Halles is a station almost mid-way, pretty much right under my hotel, actually. So there was a fair bit of walking to get there and back. Which was fine, no biggie. It was still cheaper than taking a cab.<br />
Albeit a lot more packed. While my trip in on Monday was blissfully free of people, the train was nearly full leaving Chatelet-les-Halles. When we left Gare du Nord, it was standing room in some places. The only stop after that was the airport. It&#8217;s effective public transportation, I&#8217;ll give you that! (Canadian airports and cities, please take note!)<br />
No elevators this time to slow me down. Just a really long lineup for Lufthansa. It took nearly 45 minutes to weave my way down to a clerk. I had a bit of a terrific thought as I waited. Technically, my flight is Air Canada. What if I had to go to the Air Canada counter? They&#8217;re not even in the same terminal. My only consolation was when I&#8217;d verified my flight this morning, the Lufthansa website told me my seat assignment. I could only hope that it also covered my Air Canada seat from Frankfurt to Calgary.<br />
Fears bubbled away as the rather cheery clerk (given the insane volume of people) jokingly suggested that my flight was cancelled and that I had to stay in Paris indefinitely. Admittedly, I was briefly tempted to believe him. But the rest of me quickly kicked in &#8212; I wanted to go home. I spent about 1/10th the time at the counter as the previous couple. Bag checked, boarding passes for both flights in-hand, I headed for Satellite 6.<br />
That&#8217;s the way Terminal 1 is broken up: a central hub with seven satellite areas for boarding planes. And sadly, that&#8217;s about literally all there is at Terminal 1. It&#8217;s devoid of almost everything else. It&#8217;s probably the dullest terminal I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of waiting around in for an hour and a half. (I prefer to wait in airport terminals, rather than rushing. Too many variables that could lead to a missed flight.)<br />
I had planned my Euro spending carefully, having only barely enough to pay for a muffin at a small cafe in the waiting lounge. That was fine with me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t want to go home with extra change. Still, I would have liked a ham and cheese baguette.<br />
Like the train out, the flight out was also full. Although I had an exit row, I was seated next to a woman who clearly did not fit in her chair (or really give her late-teenage son any credit for anything). I think this is partly what led to a rearrangement of seats. She was moved to the front of the plane, and the couple across the aisle were bumped a row up. The staff didn&#8217;t say why, but since I was allowed to remain and thinner people were placed in the now-vacant aisle seats next to me, I can only assume it was to ensure that the exit aisles could be cleared quickly.<br />
I passed out from exhaustion moments after the plane left the ground. I awoke only when the attendant happened to rather loudly plunk ice in a plastic cup. I was thankful for this &#8212; I got my cheese sandwich on dense German bread and a Coke. That would keep me going until I got my meal on the trans-atlantic flight.<br />
Virtually retracing my steps through Frankfurt to find my next flight (including the 700 metre-long tunnel), I rushed along just in case there was a lot of people at security. Given how heavy the airport traffic was, I didn&#8217;t want to risk holding things up. As it stands, I didn&#8217;t have to pass through security this time &#8212; just passport control. While not the speediest passing through, I was asked no questions. Stamp, done.<br />
Just past passport control was my gate, so I suddenly found myself with almost an hour to kill. Boarding would start soon, but my seat row meant I would be among the last called. Not a big deal, and far more comfortable as I wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to a jet engine the entire flight.<br />
My rowmate (I love the outside row &#8212; only two seats) was an oil driller from Oman, travelling back to his home around Great Slave Lake or something to visit family. He&#8217;d been flying already for about 20 hours. I couldn&#8217;t believe that level of stamina. I think I&#8217;d lose it after that long, personally. (I want to go to Australia someday, but the flight worries me a little.) He started chatting with me almost barely five minutes after sitting down. So much for a quiet flight.<br />
Actually, that&#8217;s not fair. He was an interesting person, having seen a great deal more than I have. And made me feel pretty damned petty about my mere 35 degree woes. Where he worked, it was 55 Celsius, not counting the blowing sand. He slept most of the flight, too, likely due to exhaustion.<br />
The flight was mostly uneventful. Some bouncing around (though we had a nasty approach to Calgary due to strong winds), the movies were there and the food was decent. I plugged away at getting these blog entries caught up. And I slept, even if just a little. While I hadn&#8217;t been flying for 20 hours before this one, I was still wiped.<br />
My bag was #155 coming off the carousel at the airport. Typical. Pass through customs, and waited to be picked up. Surprisingly not tired, I fully expect to pass out tonight.</p>
