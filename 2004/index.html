		<p>I had hoped to go some place warm for the Christmas holidays this year. I wanted to put Christmas lights on a palm tree. I wanted to make sandmen. I wanted nothing more to worry about than getting a sunburn on Boxing day.<br />
So naturally, I ended up arriving at Pearson International Airport at 6:30 on the morning of 23 December, catching the end of a nasty two-day snowstorm. There&#8217;s poetic justice in this, somewhere.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think Alex and I need to stop packing so much into a single weekend. It&#8217;s gonna kill us.<br />
Friday night was Light Night. Being fairly warm (thanks to a chinook), we went out in search of Christmas lights around town, camera in hand. There&#8217;s a lot to choose from, but one thing Alex and I noticed about Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people with too much money, and too cheap to put up lights. Something I think Alex and I will definitely work against next Christmas with our home.<br />
We went around Glamorgan, Altadore, Garrison Woods, through another section of the city I can&#8217;t remember the name of, all the way out to Discovery Ridge, and then finally into Springbank. There were only a few places that had anything of consequence. One was a string of houses in Glamorgan on a cul-de-sac that took the whole idea of Christmas lighting very seriously. That was our first stop. Ironically, it wasn&#8217;t until our last (Springbank) that we really saw something noteworthy. First were two houses on the hill (we saw them from Discovery Ridge) that had a lot of lights in the rear. Then we saw a couple houses with &#8220;ME&#8221; and &#8220;IS&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t until we took a wider look that several houses had similar letters: ME, RR, YC, HR, IS, TM, and AS. (Although the &#8220;RR&#8221; was out that night.)<br />
But one house took the biscuit. You couldn&#8217;t see their front lawn for all the lights, toys, balloons, cutouts, and whatnot erected all over it. The light was enough to be almost blinding. No music, though, so at least the sounds wouldn&#8217;t drive neighbours crazy, but the whole setup was just &#8230; well, either amazing or ridiculous. Take your choice.<br />
Saturday was a busy day, right from the start. Alex was working, having volunteered (one of four) to help out with a laboratory exercise, to help surgeons learn a new spine operation method. (Paid, of course.) This meant a (relatively) early start, and a long day in front of an x-ray machine.<br />
We went to Denny&#8217;s on 16th Ave, just east of Crowchild, for breakfast with her co-workers Andy and Fred. (Andy is an x-ray tech, like Alex; Fred leads the Quality Control (QC) effort, whom Alex works with every Wednesday.) All three (there were four in total) were working in the lab. I was just along for the big breakfast. It was my first chance to meet Fred &#8212; I finally have a face for all the stories I hear from Alex.<br />
Following breakfast, the three of them vanished off to Foothills (the hospital, not the mountains) and I headed up to Crowfoot Centre, to pick up my car. (Mini Canada had called in my car for a voluntary recall to upgrade my emissions.) This is about where my rather tiring day began.<br />
First off, I somehow managed to arrive at the Banff Trail C-Train station with a mere dollar in change. (You need two for the ticket to ride.) Don&#8217;t you just hate being in that really uncomfortably position of needing an extra bit of change, and all you have is a dollar? Luckily, one of the other patrons there offered to change my $5 bill, and then gave me a dollar after realizing he didn&#8217;t have enough for the change.<br />
I love Calgarians.<br />
It was a bit windy at the station, but the Weather Network had said that we&#8217;d have a reasonably nice day. By the time I got to Dalhousie station, it was much windier, with snow pellets. I boarded a bus to take me to Crowfoot &#8212; the #147. When I got off at the Burger King there, I was staring into a wall of white. When I walked into the Chapter&#8217;s there about five minutes after getting off the bus, the front of my body looked like someone had taken a white paint roller to me.<br />
My car was clean and shiny when I arrived, and was soon on the road. (The salt and sand from Calgary&#8217;s ongoing efforts to beat back winter were soon on my car, rather than the street.) I stopped at Chinook for the purpose of finding a particularly difficult to find present. I&#8217;d seen it there during a shopping spree Alex and I had engaged in to find her a dress, but couldn&#8217;t remember what store. Despite visiting every retailer in the building, I was unable to discover its location.<br />
Thinking that perhaps I had the wrong mall in mind, I whipped down to South Centre. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t seem to matter which mall I was in, the success was the same &#8212; nil. The frustration, not to mention my headache, was building.<br />
But it was time for me to head home. Alex and I were going to the Diagnostic Imagining (Alex&#8217;s department) Christmas party, and I had to get ready. This is when I noticed that my door wasn&#8217;t opening. Again. (See 22 November 2004.) This meant I had to climb in the passenger side to be able to drive. I&#8217;m seriously going to tear someone a new hole for this at the dealership (I had asked them *specifically* to look at this problem.)<br />
I stopped by Alex&#8217;s to get my gym clothes bag that I&#8217;d left there the night before. In doing so, I found yet another suprise. Either the Mini dealership had given me a very nice Christmas present, or some schmuck in the service department had left a battery charger in my trunk. Despite the drive, the door still wouldn&#8217;t open.<br />
I popped home just long enough to grab a memory card with a photo I was printing for someone (a woman wanted a copy for her boyfriend for Christmas). Up to London Drugs. Three hours before I could get it back. By that time, I&#8217;d be at the party, and with the events tomorrow, there was no way I&#8217;d be able to meet up and deliver the photo the next day. I&#8217;d need to find an alternative (I emailed the original and apologized for the delay).<br />
Door was still not working. People were giving me strange looks as I hopped across my front seat.<br />
Alex called not long after I got home. She&#8217;d finished early, and was heading home. I grabbed my things and headed to her place. She needed a massage after a day of moving around the x-ray machine, and with the night ahead, she didn&#8217;t want to be sore.<br />
We arrived at Canada Olympic Park just after 18:15, in plenty of time for the 18:30 dinner start. Mark and Sang had saved us seats (thankfully) at Table 22. (There were a LOT of tables. The DI department is quite large.) People in attendance had dressed in a fairly wide range, from not-quite-casual almost all the way to near-formal ball gowns. I knew a handful of people (folks that I&#8217;d been introduced to at the hospital, or those who&#8217;d also been on the dragon boat team), but the majority were strangers.<br />
Colette was the ring leader, and made most of the announcements. She also called tables, the numbers drawn at random, to go for dinner. Last year, Alex&#8217;s table had been called last. We were fifth or sixth in the list. Roast beef, chicken, lots of sides to choose from &#8212; all very tasty. While we ate, the door prizes were handed out.<br />
This is where my luck truly showed through &#8230; or the complete and utter lack of it. We&#8217;d all put our names in the hat, so to speak, which were drawn at random. You were then given a random prize. I had made the mistake, however, of trusting my table-mates not to dupe me. I went to the bathroom when Colette started collecting the names. When I got back, Alex handed me two pieces of paper, telling me that she&#8217;d missed Colette when she&#8217;d passed by. Colette told me: &#8220;Only once, Geoff!&#8221;<br />
I was confused. What was wrong with missing her? Easy &#8230; Alex and Mark decided to stuff the ballots with MY NAME. So if I got called more than once, *I&#8217;d* be the one who got in trouble. Gee, thanks, guys&#8230;<br />
As it turns out, I shouldn&#8217;t have worried. My luck is that bad. In a 100 ticket lottery, I&#8217;d lose even if I&#8217;d bought 99 tickets. Alex and Mark were dumbfounded. I challenged Alex to draw my name out of the bag within 20 tries. She couldn&#8217;t.<br />
We left not long after 22:30, having both run out of steam. It had been a long day.<br />
Allowing a bit of a chance to sleep in, we ended up rushing to make it to Grace Presbyterian on time. (Yep, another Advent Sunday means another church.) This particular event wasn&#8217;t so much for the service, but for the cantata (a musical composition for voices and orchestra based on a religious text). At Grace, this would be a great event, as it is one of Calgary&#8217;s oldest churches (it turns 100 near year). There&#8217;s a big pipe organ, and a large orchestra was assembled for the performance.<br />
The senior minister, Rev. Victor Kim, performed what he described as his &#8220;shortest sermon of the year&#8221; (received by much laughter), followed by the longest sermon of the year &#8212; the cantata. The choir came down from their perch in front of the organ, to a series of risers in front of the podium. The orchestra geared up, and the cantata began.<br />
It was a 15-song concert (including the closing hymn of &#8220;Joyful and Triumphant&#8221;), with most of the song sung by the main choir. (The children sang two of the songs.) The entire choir participated, although several of the songs had solos. I&#8217;m not sure if the soloists were part of the regular congregation &#8212; if the are, then Grace has some seriously gifted singers in their midst.<br />
The service started at 11:00, and we left just after 13:00. The air was cold and brisk, though not nearly as bad as the nasty cold snap we&#8217;d had a few days earlier (minus 20 is not pleasant, I don&#8217;t care who you are). We were going to go for tea at Steeps, but ended up hitting Janice Beaton (for lavender shortbread and some really nice cheese), then ended up stopping at a few stores and restaurants before getting to Fiore&#8217;s for a late lunch. Stops at several more stores (including Gravity Pope and Reid&#8217;s) took up enough time that getting tea wasn&#8217;t really an option anymore. We were wiped.<br />
We rested a while at Alex&#8217;s before I went out again to go pickup Jen. Jen turned 16, and I had not yet got her a birthday present (yes, I know, I&#8217;m a lousy cousin). So I took Jen out for dinner, a couple games, and ultimately (which was the original reason) to see &#8220;Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence&#8221;, a Japanese anime film about &#8230; hmm, actually, I&#8217;m not going to describe it. That&#8217;s an entire email onto its own.<br />
Alex, sadly, was not able to come out, which would have been good. I could have used her skill to help defeat Jen at air hockey. Mind you, that could have been retribution for the embarassment of letting Peter (at Sumo) know it was her birthday. There&#8217;s nothing like a bunch of Japanese wait staff singing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; and &#8220;I Just Called (To Say I Love You)&#8221; &#8212; loudly &#8212; to make you feel like the centre of attention.<br />
The movie was long, but good. I think I need to see it again to really wrap my head around it, though. The basic plot line was easy enough to follow, but some of the more intricate details were &#8230; well, reading subtitles and follow action with deep dialogue isn&#8217;t easy.<br />
It was late when I finally got home. I was tired. Really tired. It&#8217;s been a long weekend. And it&#8217;s going to be a long week.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a while, hasn&#8217;t it? No, I&#8217;m not dead. I wasn&#8217;t abducted by aliens. I wasn&#8217;t held hostage. I took a bit of a break. I had to.<br />
In mid-September, I suffered a bit of a breakdown. Too much stress that I&#8217;d allowed to work into my life caught up with me and brought the Geoff Sowrey Machine to a grinding halt. Thankfully, that didn&#8217;t last too long, and was able to get back up and running not long afterwards. So why did I take such a long break before writing again?<br />
Well, one thing that bucket o&#8217; stress did was really hamper my ability to write and edit properly. I was afraid that such a thing was happening, but didn&#8217;t really think it was harming me. Sadly, after one particular entry about my cousin Pam&#8217;s wedding, it became all-too-clear that my ability to write was in jeopardy. I unintentionally insulted my family &#8212; a grievous error for which I am deeply regretful. That brought an end to my writing, at least until I felt competant enough to write again.<br />
Which brings me to this weekend&#8230; (relax, events of weeks, er, months past will be brought to the web as soon as I can edit them all together)<br />
The weekend couldn&#8217;t have started soon enough for me &#8212; last week was almost nothing except planning, strategy, writing, and a lot of stress (long story, which I&#8217;m not really going to get into, suffice to say that the issues were resolved). Friday night was nice: a couple of beers starting at 16:30 (we celebrated a &#8220;No-one Got Fired&#8221; day), followed by a brief stop to wish my friend Angie a happy birthday. Then it was off home to wash off the smell of &#8220;Fuel&#8221; (where the start of Angie&#8217;s party was) and wait for Alex to come home.<br />
We woke up earlier on Saturday than we had in previous weeks, and immediately got to the task of the morning: breakfast. But we opted for breakfast at Nellie&#8217;s In The Loop; one of the Nellie&#8217;s restaurants, based in Marda Loop. We had thought of going to the Belvedere Diner (across the road), but the lineups pretty much settled that deal. Food in our bellies, we aimed for stop #2: Chinook Centre.<br />
As you already know, it&#8217;s December. It&#8217;s Christmas season. So not only were we looking for presents for others (I&#8217;m not quite done yet), we were looking for outfits for the various Christmas parties that are coming up, most notably the MRT party next Saturday. Alex needed a dress. For those of you who&#8217;ve never shopped for a dress before, you&#8217;d be surprised how hard it is to not only find one that looks good, but doesn&#8217;t scratch your skin (Alex found one that seemed to be made ENTIRELY of sparkles), but also comes in your size. Despite a mall-wide search, we ended up finding one in Sears, of all places. I settled for a new dress shirt and a tie, in colours that would compliment Alex&#8217;s navy-blue and silver outfit.<br />
Although December, Chinook wasn&#8217;t wall-to-wall people when we arrived. However, as we began to head towards the Sears (where we ultimatlely found the dress), we noticed that the population was growing exponentially. Having completed our transactions in Sears, we headed towards the car, and abandoned the mall with all due haste.<br />
Destination? Heritage Park, for their 12 Days of Christmas weekend. (It&#8217;s actually several weekends.) Basically, it&#8217;s the same as the park usually, except the amusement park is closed, the trains aren&#8217;t running, and the theme around most of the buildings is decidedly Christmas. It&#8217;s quite nice, actually, and with a bit of planning, could be something that Alex and I make a tradition. Especially when we have kids.<br />
Yes, we talk extensively about having kids. Prepare for it, folks.<br />
We found some particularly nice things in one store, especially drink mixes (powders for hot apple and cranberry ciders, hot chocolates of various varieties), candies, and fudge (we&#8217;re fudge-o-holics). In an adjoining building, we found a group of calligraphers, who whipped off pretty much anything you needed or wanted. That&#8217;s where we ran into Rebecca&#8217;s mom (who travels in the calligraphy circles in Calgary).<br />
The Wainwright Hotel was open, but the forecast for food was a little bleak. Hot dogs in one room, and an apparent lineup for the other. So we aborted and looked elsewhere, such as the bakery (basically, nothing but cookies), the Club Cafe (didn&#8217;t really hit us), and Gunn&#8217;s Dairy Farm (closed by the time we got there). The roundhouse was also open, though didn&#8217;t have any food &#8212; instead, had a wide range of gift ideas. Most were arranged in international themes, so one would see Christmas from various parts of the world, with little descriptions about that area.<br />
One thing that stood out for me was the description of the true meaning of the &#8220;Twelve Days of Christmas&#8221;. Most people think this is about one person giving presents to another. In reality, it was a song created to help teach the core of Catholicism to children during a period in English history when being a Catholic was considered bad. Like, lock you away for a very long time kind of bad. The practice went on from 1558 to 1829, when Catholics were finally emancipated. Here&#8217;s how the numbers actually break down (text borrowed from Appleseeds.org, &#8216;cuz I&#8217;m too damn lazy to type it all out):</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Day: The partridge in a pear tree is Christ Jesus upon the Cross. In the song, Christ is symbolically presented as a mother partridge because she would feign injury to decoy a predator away from her nestlings. She was even willing to die for them. The tree is the symbol of the fall of the human race through the sin of Adam and Eve. It is also the symbol of its redemption by Jesus Christ on the tree of the Cross.</li>
<li>2nd Day:The &#8220;two turtle doves&#8221; refers to the Old and New Testaments.</li>
<li>3rd Day:The &#8220;three French hens&#8221; stand for faith, hope and love &#8212; the three gifts of the Spirit that abide (1 Corinthians 13).</li>
<li>4th Day:The &#8220;four calling birds&#8221; refers to the four evangelists who wrote the Gospels &#8212; Matthew, Mark, Luke and John &#8212; which sing the song of salvation through Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>5th Day:The &#8220;five golden rings&#8221; represents the first five books of the Bible, also called the Jewish Torah: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.</li>
<li>6th Day:The &#8220;six geese a-laying&#8221; is the six days of creation.</li>
<li>7th Day:The &#8220;seven swans a-swimming&#8221; refers to the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.</li>
<li>8th Day:The &#8220;eight maids a milking &#8221; reminded children of the eight beatitudes listed in the Sermon on the Mount.</li>
<li>9th Day:The &#8220;nine ladies dancing&#8221; were the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit found in Galatians 5:22-23: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control.</li>
<li>10th Day:The &#8220;ten lords a-leaping&#8221; represents the Ten Commandments</li>
<li>11th Day:The &#8220;eleven pipers piping&#8221; refers to the eleven faithful apostles.</li>
<li>12th Day:The Ã¯ ¿ ½twelve drummers drumming&#8221; were the twelve points of belief expressed in the ApostlesÃ¯ ¿ ½ Creed: belief in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, made man, crucified, died and arose on the third day, that he sits at the right hand of the father and will come again, the resurrection of the dead and life everlasting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn something new every day, eh?<br />
Afterwards, we headed out in search of food. Alex was starting to gnaw on my arm, and I felt it important to keep my limbs intact. As we headed back to the Hotel, we could hear the carolers on the stage belting out song after song. But one of them caught our attention. They were singing &#8220;Linus and Lucy&#8221;, the single-most recognizable tune from &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;.<br />
Yes, singing.<br />
As there are no words to the song, they were singing &#8220;do do do do do do do&#8221;, broken into women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s parts. There&#8217;s a bit after the first two stanzas where all of them sang &#8220;DA DA DA DA!&#8221; and followed the sound of the piano. Alex and I about fell over laughing, it sounded so ridiculous.<br />
All we got at the Hotel was a warm dog (not quite hot), two bags of chips, and a couple of drinks. Unsatisfied, we tried for gingerbread cookies at the bakery. You could have used them to armour-plate a tank. The sheer horrors of food having set it, and our interest waning, we headed off in search of the car, and new shopping experiences &#8230; at South Centre Mall.<br />
South Centre was far less busy than Chinook had been, though we didn&#8217;t make any huge scores (although Alex did find a shawl-like thing (it&#8217;s hard to describe, needless to say) for her outfit next Saturday. Following the mall, we headed over to the adjacent Safeway for dinner fixin&#8217;s and for eggs, to make better gingerbread than the armour plating we&#8217;d had earlier.<br />
Dinner eaten and gingerbread dough cooling, we went to return one movie (&#8220;Bad Santa&#8221;) and rent a new one (&#8220;Monster&#8221;). This became partial entertainment. It&#8217;s been snowing this weekend, and the temperature on Saturday was enough to turn the Edmonton Trail hill into a bit of an ice rink. And that seems to attract every idiot in town to prove that you can, in fact, get up an icy hill merely by putting your foot to the floor and smoking your tires beyond repair. Morons.<br />
We were a little late arriving at church the next morning, owing to the aforementioned cold and snow. (The roads were a little treacherous, and it really doesn&#8217;t help matters when the Calgary Police Service decides to pull someone on Memorial over right at a curve in the road. They caused more accidents than they were trying to stop.)<br />
Why did we go to church? Alex wanted to, for one, but also because I&#8217;ve never seen a Christmas service before. It&#8217;s something new for me, and it&#8217;s a part of Alex&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s fun to share experiences, don&#8217;t you think? Following church, we headed to Market Mall for lunch and, yes, more shopping. (We stopped along the way to drop off a small batch of gingerbread cookies to the X-Ray staff in Emergency at the Foot.)<br />
A bag of clothes (I needed new shirts) and two digesting ice cream cones (from the Marble Slab Creamery) later, we returned to my place via Safeway to make dinner: pizza. Something quick. We were heading out to the Knox Choir Festival at Knox United downtown, and were meeting up with Rebecca at the Tim Horton&#8217;s a block away. Which was good, because it was about -20 tonight. Brrr.<br />
The three of us arrived at the church about 15 minutes before the show started. It was packed, wall-to-wall, including the balconies. We barely managed to find seats in the upper back. The show was recorded by CBC radio for rebroadcast in the Calgary area. It was interesting to watch the various choirs come in and play carols I&#8217;d never even heard of before. Two particular choirs were the Korean Presbyterian Choir (which sang traditional English carols in Korean, and sounded amazing) and the Chinook Show Choir, a collection of older women who sang just beautifully. We, as the audience, sang in between the choirs with the Knox Choir and a really loud organ.<br />
Dad would have loved it.<br />
Oh, and one of those choirs decided to do &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;. Yep, how often do you hear people singing &#8220;Linus and Lucy&#8221; twice in one weekend? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever gonna get it out of my head.<br />
Christmas is definitely here. This is going to be a great Christmas season.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Someone had the brilliant idea to go hiking in Kananaskis. Apparently this person didn&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s almost winter. (And around here, that means it <em>is</em> winter.)<br />
We all started off at Phil&#8217;s on 16th Ave. Alex and I were meeting up with a couple of Alex&#8217;s co-workers for a bite to eat before heading off. Originally, Alex and I weren&#8217;t going hiking. It&#8217;s cold, and that means hiking is &#8230; well &#8230; uncomfortable. Alex had other ideas, and though I didn&#8217;t know what they were, they pretty much excluded hiking.<br />
Breakfast changed those plans. So after finishing, we drove at a break-neck pace to Alex&#8217;s for warmer clothes, then bolted out to Upper Lake in Kananaskis park. Despite the cool weather (about -6), there were a surprising number of people there already. We tried to catch up with the rest of the group, but they were already quite a ways along. (I drive fast, but Andy apparently drives faster.) Alex and I were left to ourselves.<br />
We started from the boat launch and walked all the way around until the sluice gate on the far side near to where we&#8217;d camped in the summer (see [[Birthday Camping in Kananaskis]]). We passed a few people as we walked along, but most of the time it was just us, the breeze, and the cold silence of the mountains. It&#8217;s breath-taking.<br />
It&#8217;s also freezing. I wasn&#8217;t too affected, but Alex&#8217;s chattering could probably be heard for miles. (Kidding, honey &#8212; honest!)<br />
We met up with Andy just before we got to the sluice gate, where we headed to the road. We took the road back to the boat launch, managing to catch up with Andy on his return trip. But instead of continuing to follow Andy back to Calgary, we headed towards Canmore. It was time for another surprise&#8230;<br />
We got a cabin. A small one, nothing fancy. Well, the first one was small and nothing fancy until we&#8217;d realized that he hadn&#8217;t cleaned it yet. We were moved to a more rustic one next door that was slightly more than chilly. The gas fireplace would have to be turned way up to make it bearable.<br />
There was a party going on in Banff (Bamf!). We had no idea that there was one. We didn&#8217;t even know what it was called until we found someone who explained: WinterStart. Something to make people feel excited about the lack of sunshine (the sun effectively sets about 15:30 due to the mountains) and the cold (even though Banff is often warmer than Calgary).<br />
First up: Fudge. It&#8217;s a tradition.<br />
Then it was winter hats for Alex. This at times feels almost like beating one&#8217;s head against a wall. We&#8217;ll find one for her eventually, I&#8217;m sure. But it&#8217;s gonna take a lot of hats before she&#8217;s happy.<br />
Dinner at Old Spaghetti Factory. It ain&#8217;t what it used to be, and the food did a number on Alex. We ended up abandoning the rest of our meal and headed back to the cabin where I spent my time trying to keep Alex warm.<br />
It was pure irony then that the shower ran out of hot water as I was finishing the next morning. (Ouch.) Back to Banff (Bamf!) for breakfast at Phil&#8217;s, then up to the hot springs to really warm up. More fudge. Dinner was in Canmore &#8212; Boston Pizza.<br />
Extremes of such cold and heat should give one the flu. So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days! </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Shrub is back for another four years. Oh. Joy.<br />
Did no-one realize what kind of moron is at the head of the US Government? I can only guess not, as the United States again voted in one of the most dangerous men on the planet. The guy freaks me out. Arrogant, ignorant, and brash. A bad combination for a politician.<br />
The problem is the Democrats. They need to find someone with more personality than a telephone pole. Kerry, in case you haven&#8217;t noticed, is rather dull. Actually, nix that. Gore was rather dull. Kerry is Xanax incarnate. If you have any hope against charisma (no matter how evil it seems), you need to put in someone who can at least look and sound more than a mere talking head!<br />
Bush had my favourite line-to-hate from politicians: &#8220;America has spoken&#8221;. Spoken. With 51% of the vote. That&#8217;s not really saying much when you consider that <em>every second person voted against you</em>! If that&#8217;s what you call speaking up in a crowd, it&#8217;s no wonder you&#8217;re not listening to your constituents.<br />
Oh, right, you are listening. Corporate America and ill-gotten influence. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Let&#8217;s recap on Bush&#8217;s first term: After 9/11 (and his reputed 40% vacation time), he drums up the support to go after Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Makes a complete mess by forcing out the Taliban and is unable to find the person he&#8217;s looking for. Yells at Canada for not helping. (Take a guess who&#8217;s going to spend decades keeping the peace after you&#8217;re gone, ya yutz?)<br />
Unable to stop Bin Laden, but still needing a victory, goes after Iraq and Saddam Hussein, the &#8220;most dangerous man alive&#8221;.<br />
Hussein. In the Iraqi economic wasteland. Dangerous to whom? Even Israel says he&#8217;s more of a minor irritation externally. He&#8217;s more dangerous to himself with his paranoia and germophobia.<br />
Oh, right. Corporate America. Oil. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Claims of weapons of mass destruction are realized to be mere words: weapons of mass <em>distraction</em> to give Bush the &#8220;right&#8221; to wreak havoc and kill a lot of innocent people. And you think Hussein is dangerous? Boy, look in the mirror sometime.<br />
Yet again, the US has to go in en masse to clean up a puppet they set up before and let run amok. (Witness Noriega and Castro.) Some regimes never learn.<br />
Interestingly enough, the world (courtesy of globalvote.org) voted for Kerry. We hoped that Kerry would be a tad more honest and wouldn&#8217;t be so keen to wage war on another country somewhere. Sadly, given his waffling, the US ended up with a &#8220;devil you don&#8217;t know&#8221; problem. What would Kerry actually do?<br />
So welcome to another four years of hollow rhetoric, shallow lies, and more fodder for late night talk show hosts and documentary filmmakers. Let&#8217;s just hope this doesn&#8217;t go anymore to his head than it already has.<br />
Oh, and I have to ask, what&#8217;s with Americans turning so homophobic &#8212; what&#8217;s the big deal, eh?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another busy weekend at hand. Where oh where to start?<br />
I guess first off, I&#8217;ve finally had to give up my old Nokia brick cell phone. My faithful and antique companion has served me well since arriving in Calgary so many years ago. But the battery has a finite lifespan and has finally tanked. I can keep a charge for about a half-day now. Kind of makes it not worth my while.<br />
So while Alex and I were wandering about Market Mall, we stopped into the Telus store to see if I could get a replacement battery. Quelle surprise, none to be had. I had to buck down, pay the $50 and get a new one. But while we were discussing this, Alex started ogling a nice blue LG phone.<br />
Until today, Alex didn&#8217;t carry a cell phone. Her only cell phone (a duplicate of mine) ended up with Allen (her father), who still uses it. But with couples always trying to stay in contact, it seemed useful. Alex wasn&#8217;t sure, but ultimate caved when we realized the advantages. I think she&#8217;ll use it, but only time will tell.<br />
I had to work a bit this weekend &#8212; MB is a fun client that never seems to keep me bored. It wasn&#8217;t a lot of work, so it still allowed me to do some grocery shopping (including a pumpkin) and make dinner for Alex. Notably because last night was Hallowe&#8217;en!<br />
Beef stew is a new &#8220;specialty&#8221; of mine, I think. Considering it&#8217;s my first, I think it&#8217;s pretty good. Alex inhaled hers. The fact that it was served in a bread bowl probably has nothing to do with that, though&#8230; (inside joke, trust me).<br />
Not many kids disturbed our dinner. We watched TV with the lights out so it was easier to see out the window for incoming rug rats. This continued until I got a phone call from Tamara who apparently had fainted on the C-Train. I raced down to the station at Stampede to pick her up from the ambulance where she was waiting. She looked a little shaken but otherwise fine. Low blood sugar it seemed. A bit of food and all would be well.<br />
I hope the week coming up ain&#8217;t this busy!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We had 2005 planning meetings this week, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. They can be quite painful, if for no reason other than for going over projects all day. It really wears on the brain, and the body. Well, my body, anyway. I have to drink Coke to focus well, since these meetings have a tendency to cause my brain to tune out. At the end of Wednesday, I was exhausted. It also didn&#8217;t help that I was having to stay late to catch up on work I was unable to do during the day.<br />
But as is typical with these annual meetings, we usually have an annual team building event. There were no green alligators or long-necked geese this year (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]), which I&#8217;m partially thankful for. (That had been a lot of fun, but I felt quite hungover the next day &#8230; not that today is going all that swimmingly, I might add.)<br />
Following the end of our work day, those of us on the Mercedes-Benz USA account high-tailed it over to Eau Claire Market and the Cinescape, an arcade/lounge attached to the Cineplex Odeon theatre. We didn&#8217;t know exactly what was in store for us, especially since Scott, Torin, and I were the first to arrive.<br />
Somehow, though, we stuck out like a giraffe in a penguin parade, and a very helpful server by the name of Nigel came to our rescue. We had two pool tables, a series of tables, and an unlimited bar tab at our disposal, with food coming along shortly thereafter.<br />
Let the party begin.<br />
By 18:00, most of those who would be attending had arrived. Although the team numbers about 60, maybe only 2/3 of them showed up. While we waited for dinner, we played pool (I got smoked by Torin and Casey, who are both pool sharks) and chatted amongst ourselves. Some of the designers played darts (which, after Luke&#8217;s going away party &#8212; see [[Luke leaves Critical Mass]] &#8212; I had decided I was going to avoid).<br />
Dinner was quite good &#8212; much better than I had expected. Salads, buns, mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and chicken or salmon (or both, if you prefered). It tasted great, even standing up. While we ate, the rules of the game were explained&#8230;<br />
Each of us were given $1,000 in Monopoly money (photocopied, mind you) and 40 game tokens. The idea was to bet each other on games and try win as much money as possible. We were divided into teams, and the team with the most money at the end won the bragging rights. (As it stands, it&#8217;s up for debate which team ultimately ended up winning, no doubt in part to the quantities of alcohol consumed.)<br />
Not being a betting man, myself (I follow the wise words of Jack Burton: When the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake, just look that big old storm right in the eye and say, &#8220;Give me your best shot. I can take it!&#8221; &#8230; no wait, wrong quote &#8230; I never bet my money, only my life). I pocketed the whole wad in my back pocket and played dumb the rest of the evening.<br />
For those of you who know me, I can play dumb real well.<br />
I finally beat Adrian in a game of air hockey. It&#8217;s taken a while. It was a hard-fought game, with both of us sending the puck in multiple directions off the table. The score came down to 7-6. It would be the last time I choose to challenge Adrian last night. (I would take Scott later on, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly who won &#8230; it was probably him.) I jumped in and out of games throughout the night, until all my tokens (including a healthy refill from Dan) were depleted. My trigger finger hurt.<br />
Talking and boasting continued until the lounge closed, and we all headed over to the Barley Mill to continue. Now, true believers, this is where things get a tad hazy, because I&#8217;m not entirely sure how long we were there for. I do remember one beer and playing a game where you try to guess what three words have in common (quite a good game, I might add). But that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t think we were there very long before we all upped and headed for Chinese.<br />
We lost two along the way, but Dan was still leading the charge. We ended up at Me and U, on the corner of 3rd Ave. and Centre Street. I&#8217;d never been there before, but it seemed like fun. Or would have. You see, as soon as I sat down and had my first cup of tea, my body started to rebel. I went to the bathroom and stood over the sink for about 10 minutes before Dan came to find me. I&#8217;d officially had the buscuit, and headed home.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what happened. I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d had that much. Maybe I did, and just don&#8217;t remember. Either way, though, the walk home wasn&#8217;t pleasant. I wasn&#8217;t sick, just really dizzy. It wasn&#8217;t like any enbriated state I&#8217;d experienced. Mind you, my memory was a little off, so it wasn&#8217;t easy to tell.<br />
Speaking of memory, mine was so shot that I didn&#8217;t wake up until 8:30, thanks to Tamara making noise in the bathroom. Crap. I hauled ass and was out of the house in less than 10 minutes, arriving at work just over an hour late. I depleted the Bistro&#8217;s supply of ginger ale. Ate several slices of banana bread. But it wasn&#8217;t until the greasy A&amp;W lunch that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Thank god we only do this once a year&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept horribly. I&#8217;m not sure if it was from the hiking we&#8217;d done yesterday, or the troubling thoughts running through my mind as a result of last night. I&#8217;d felt like Alex and I had been abandoned for breakfast, as well, with everyone but us having done up to Uncle David and Aunt Alaine&#8217;s suite for muffins, coffee, and juice. I suddenly felt like we&#8217;d been completely excluded. It left a very hollow feeling with me.<br />
Alex and I headed up to the restaurant, which was where we&#8217;d agreed to go with everyone else for brunch. We sat there for a while, wondering where everyone was. The feeling that we were being shunned as a result of last night wasn&#8217;t going away. It wasn&#8217;t until they (Cathy, Craig, Mom, Brenda, Mike, and Nana &#8212; Jen slept in) appeared from Dave and Alaine&#8217;s suite that I started to feel a little more normal.<br />
We gorged ourselves on breakfast. I started to feel better, and put off the negative thoughts as nothing more than paranoia. When brunch finally rolled to a close, Alex and I headed up to Dave and Alaine&#8217;s suite to bid a good morning, and farewell. I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be seeing them before they headed back to Kelowna, so it was the best possible chance. (As it turns out, we saw them again that evening.) Pam and Sean were there, still wired from the events of yesterday, despite barely four hours of sleep. The large room (which contained a sitting area and small kitchen-like space) was littered with fruit and muffins, juice, and chocolate milk (for, guess who?).<br />
Hanging around for a little while (and being joined by the others) to chat a bit, we then returned to our rooms to pack up. It took a bit of effort to get everyone put away (a few trips were needed for Mike and Brenda&#8217;s room alone). Once our stuff was away, we helped pack up the remainders from last night &#8212; plates and leftover liquor, wine, and beer. All of it went into Mike&#8217;s truck (borrowed for the purposes of transportation).<br />
Packing complete, Alex and I departed to do some shopping. The only thing on our list? Jeans, for Alex. We hit several stores before tag-teaming almost the entire selection at The Bay (yes, believe it or not, there is a Bay in Banff). Jeans in hand, we stopped next at the Old Spaghetti Factory for a late lunch.<br />
&#8220;Late&#8221; being the operative word. I didn&#8217;t realize what time it was until we left. We needed to be at Mike and Brenda&#8217;s house for 17:00 to help move a couch. We didn&#8217;t even depart Banff (Bamf!) until almost 15:45, having needed to take a sidetrip to take a photo of the Banff Springs from Surprise Corner. It was still snowing when we finally left the protection of the mountains. Calgary would be under a blanket of snow.<br />
The couch had been moved by the time we got there. The group of us, joined soon after Alex and I arrived by Dave and Alaine, returning the truck, moved into the living room for pizza and a slideshow of the photos we&#8217;d taken. Craig, Mom, Mike, and I ran through our collective sets, describing them as needed.<br />
It got to be late. I want to be up early tomorrow to hit the gym &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a weekend of overeating to work off. So we prepared to leave. That&#8217;s when I found out that Cathy and Craig are staying at a hotel tonight. I felt a little cheated, having found out at that point. I understood their reason (without having to ask), but suddenly felt like they were avoiding me. Yeah, there&#8217;s that paranoia again.<br />
No biggie, though. I&#8217;ll see them tomorrow for lunch. Assuming, of course, that all hell doesn&#8217;t break loose.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The schedule had been for breakfast at 9:00. Cathy and Craig weren&#8217;t terribly happy about that (it is early, after all, especially after being out drinking most of the night), but were up and running before Alex and I. We barely pulled ourselves out of bed in time. Jen, of course, slept right through breakfast.<br />
Melissa&#8217;s is a Banff (Bamf!) landmark, and right across the street from the Banff Park Lodge. It&#8217;s a small restaurant, but had been in Banff (Bamf!) for ages. The owners, as a result, also own some of the other local properties. Melissa&#8217;s also hosts an annual road race.<br />
Packed full of food, we returned to the hotel to figure out our day&#8217;s activities. Last night, Mike and Craig declared that they were going to hike Sulphur Mountain. Having already done that this year (see [[Jazz Up Your Weekend at the Banff Centre]]), Alex and I were content to do differently. Based on a suggestion, we headed off in search of Johnston Canyon.<br />
Johnston Canyon is a little, out of the way hike about 20 minutes west of Banff, along Highway 1A (note, it&#8217;s NOT off the Trans Canada). I love driving down Highway 1A, as it&#8217;s not only a nice trip, but the road is all twisty and windy. In a small car, say a Mini, it&#8217;s a lot of fun.<br />
When you&#8217;re driving around in most national parks, you&#8217;ll periodically see cars parked at the side of the road, for no apparent reason. Take the opportunity to slow down and look around. Chances are, there&#8217;s a good wildlife opportunity. In our case, it was a bull elk, grazing not 10 metres away from the highway. Although he didn&#8217;t cooperate (staying behind bushes), I did manage to snap a couple of interesting pictures before we headed on.<br />
The parking lot at the foot of the Johnston Canyon hiking trail was nearly empty. Despite being almost 11:00, it seemed few were out for the morning hike. Being a bit chilly (the temperature was reading about 4 degree Celsius in the car), we made sure we were adequately bundled up before heading off.<br />
The Canyon trail is quite interesting. Unlike most of the trails that I&#8217;ve been on, especially within Banff National Park, this one was paved. It wasn&#8217;t smooth pavement, to be sure (so don&#8217;t think that a regular wheelchair would make the journey easily &#8230; though you could probably take one quite some distance before you hit the stairs), but it was easier than compacted gravel.<br />
Once you get into the canyon, the pavement stops and starts. In places where there is no pavement, there are extensive steel and concrete catwalks that run along the canyon walls. Never in my life would have I expected to see such a thing. There is one thing about building walkways and bridges over creeks and rivers, but to build a catwalk system into the depths of the canyon, sinking pylons into the canyons walls and floor, just so people could go look was just incredulous. It seems, to me at least, to be completely AGAINST the policies of Parks Canada, which I had always viewed as &#8220;minimal impact&#8221;.<br />
In fact, there was even a work crew there adding a new catwalk section.<br />
Rants about the impact on the environment aside, the Canyon is gorgeous. Despite clouds pretty much having obscured the sky, and some of the higher hills around the canyon, the inside seemed immune to the lack of sunshine. After a couple of turns in the canyon, it was clear why Parks Canada was installing the catwalk &#8212; there is no better way to see such beauty. The water there is clear; it looks almost like thick, turbulent air. If there is no glare from the sky, you can see every feature to the bottom, and sometimes it&#8217;s hard to tell that water&#8217;s even there.<br />
Johnston Canyon is home to several waterfalls of various heights. There are two of particular note: the Lower and Upper falls. The Lower Falls features a large, deep bowl carved out of the rocky walls. Erosion over the eons has also carved out a small tunnel on the east side of Johnston Creek, though which you can see the falls much more closely. The Upper Falls, which marked the turning point for us on our hike, is the highest in the Canyon. There are higher ones in the Banff/Yoho/Jasper park system (Takakkaw Falls &#8212; see [[BC Vacation: Three Valley Gap to Calgary]]), but these you can get really close to, thanks to a catwalk that extends right out over the creek, facing the falls.<br />
As we began our trek back to the car, it began to snow. It&#8217;s October in the mountains, which means winter. Last year, Calgary got its first snowfall on 29 October (see [[Calgary&#8217;s first heavy snowfall of the season]]). I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s snowing there now, but it&#8217;s certainly snowing here in Banff (Bamf!). The snow wasn&#8217;t the soft, fluffy stuff, either. It was those hard little pellets that bounce off your face. They sting a bit.<br />
There was barely anything on the ground by the time we got to the car, but on the drive back it was clear that the snow would be staying around a while. So was that elk we saw earlier, except now he was just lying down at the side of the road, about 8 metres from where he&#8217;d been eating, out in clear view. He was staring at something &#8212; presumably his harem &#8212; but we couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was.<br />
Arriving back in Banff (Bamf!), we went out in search of three things: food, fudge, and a navel ring (for Alex, not me). Food was at Bruno&#8217;s, because you simply can&#8217;t get better sweet potato fries anywhere else. We split a hamburger. As for fudge, we were thwarted at Rocky Mountain, which had mysteriously closed. We had to default to the Fudgery, which we think we&#8217;re going to stop patroning. Their slices are too large, and often quite dry. The ring was from the rock and gem store.<br />
Showered, shaved, dressed, we left for the wedding ceremony at about 15:45. There were two possible locations for the wedding, one at the gazebo next to the Bow River, and inside the Whyte Museum in the event of inclement weather. Given that it was snowing fairly hard, and below the magic temperature threshold of 14 degrees, we were to be inside.<br />
Incidentally, there was no irony lost that it should snow on Pam&#8217;s wedding day. Pam, who like her father (Uncle David), does not like the cold. Actually, that&#8217;s putting it mildly. To say simple say that would be to imply that Florida had only a few minor rain showers this year. Pam throws on fleece sweaters in the middle of summer when the sun goes down.<br />
The ceremony was in a small room at the back of the museum, about 30 feet by 30 feet, part of which was taken up with a stairwell. Most of the guests were crammed into the room, waiting to see what would happen. A small podium on the west side, next to the window, would be the focus of attention. We gathered ourselves around it.<br />
Before long, a man in his 40s spoke up. I thought it was the justice of the peace. It turned out to be Rod, Sean&#8217;s brother. It was then explained that Rod and Darren (Pam&#8217;s brother) were sharing the duties of officiating the wedding. (The story goes that they managed to squeak in through changes in Alberta&#8217;s officiating process. They had the ability to marry only Pam and Sean, and only today. Talk about specificity.)<br />
It was a civil affair, so there wasn&#8217;t the same level of spirituality one would get in a church. Rod was an eloquent speaker, and had little difficulty with his part of the ceremony. Darren, not being quite the public speaker, had a bit of a waver in the voice, and stumbled at a couple of parts. For the record, so did Sean and Pam as they recited their vows. The vows, incidentally, contained the typical requirements: love, devotion, commitment through thick &#8216;n thin, and so forth. They also contained a couple of unique items: Sean had to keep Pam warm, and Pam had to make sure to find healthy chocolate milk for Sean.<br />
With the ceremony over, the photographs began immediately. The photographer, who had been running around during the ceremony, now took control. First in order was a group photograph of the 90-odd people in attendance. It took a bit of organization, trying to fit everyone into the photo so that all could be seen. It wasn&#8217;t an easy shot, especially considering the small size of the room, but she managed to get all the guests into the shot. With that, the next round of photos with friends started. The family, which included Alex and I, retreated to a room downstairs to sip champagne and eat chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for our turn.<br />
The family photos were done in two rounds: Tisdales and Wades. The photographer had us all line up very specifically, and posed us all for the scene. It was quite interesting, and I dared not move, lest ruin the picture. It didn&#8217;t take long, and the photos were over for us. The Wade clan came next, and the pictures were over.<br />
Calling upon Darren and Ginny for a moment, Alex and I had our picture taken on one of the several rooms of the museum, against a backdrop reminiscent of the cliffs you see along the Trans Canada highway, just east of the east entrance to the Banff (Bamf!) townsite.<br />
With that, we headed back to the hotel in the still-falling snow. After a quick stop at the hotel room (Alex wanted to change, and I wanted to ditch some of things I was carrying), we headed up to the Glacier Salon, site of the reception party. Although officially to start at 17:30, we were a little early. That ended up being a bit fortuitous, since Mike needed an experiment couple to practice on for the photos. Mike was taking pictures of every person who came to the reception.<br />
The photos were at the fireplace that dominated half of the north wall. (The other half was a frosted glass wall, cut and etched to represent the surrounding mountains. It barely went up a quarter of the height of the massive vaulted ceiling.) Windows ran down the length of the east wall, to a dance area at the southern end. The bar also ran along the south wall, but jutting well into the room (separating the dance floor from everything else). The west wall was windowed (with blinds) and had the doors to the rest of the hotel.<br />
Ten tables filled the room, one head table and nine guest tables. Each had eight seats. Cathy, Craig, Alex, and I were relegated to table #9 &#8212; the last one. It was probably the single safest move to make.<br />
Guests were arriving, mingling, drinking, eating hors d&#8217;ouevres, and generally being merry. Not long after, Sean and Pam arrived, having had their photos taken at the Gazebo. I can only imagine how cold Pam must&#8217;ve been. With that, we were directed to our tables for the meal to begin.<br />
The rules came out almost immediately. Like with most of the other weddings I&#8217;d been to in recent years, clinking of glasses was poo-poo&#8217;d. Instead, each table was given an envelope. In the envelope was a question about Pam or Sean, that had to be answered by the table. The table then had to present the answers (up to five options) to either Pam or Sean (whomever the question wasn&#8217;t about) to guess correctly. If they were stumped, they had to kiss. Otherwise, the table had to kiss. There were two wildcards.<br />
As consolation for being the last table, we got the wildcard for Pam. Cathy and I immediately dived into a wealth of childhood trivia that we could use to stump Sean. The problem was that we had too much stuff, most of which was vague even for us. Everyone else at the table (who knew Pam, anyway) plugged away at the question, desperate to not have to kiss amongst ourselves. We finally came across one&#8230;<br />
The story went like this: Many years ago, Pam had gone travelling in Europe. She had misjudged her budgetary needs, and ended up having to call home for help. What country was she in when this happened? The answers we gave were England, Germany, France, Italy, and the kicker: It never happened. Now I had to check with Darren because I wanted to make sure that we had the right country. Problem? Well, it was option #5 &#8212; it never happened. Leave it to my family to embellish. This is why we put on the fifth option. As it turns out, this stumped Sean, too. We were quite happy to have found a good one.<br />
Dinner was wonderful &#8212; filet mignon or chicken, depending on which you wanted. (I have to say that the chicken was really tasty, although I had gone for the beef.) A cream of asparagus soup started us off, followed by a salad that I can&#8217;t quite describe. Dessert was a deadly-rich slice of chocolate cake&#8230;<br />
&#8230;along with some entertainment. Sean wasn&#8217;t about to make it through this reception alive, not if his family had anything to say about it. Which, of coure, they did. So they launched into a skit, putting Sean on a mock trial, where his family (led by his father as judge) set about to embarrass Sean, and flog him senseless with pool toys. A little jerky at times, it had the desired effect, and proved that in fact, the Tisdales weren&#8217;t the weirdest family in attendance.<br />
Pam and Sean&#8217;s friends then conducted the Albertan equivalent to the Newfie induction ceremony. (To become an honourary Newfoundlander, you have to drink a shot of screech and kiss a cod.) To be an Albertan, it seems, you have to down a bloody caesar (celery was apparently optional), wear a red clown nose and proclaim that &#8220;I vote PC&#8221;, whack a rubber rat with a baseball bat while chanting &#8220;rat-free province&#8221;, and kiss a pack of raw beef (covered in cellophane, of course). I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten past the caesar (I hate tomato juice).<br />
Dancing began shortly thereafter. Alex had asked if I would dance with her this time (having completely stood her up at Jon and Pearl&#8217;s wedding &#8212; see [[Jon and Pearl&#8217;s Wedding]]), and was determined to do so. Sadly, the one song that I thought would be good &#8212; &#8220;What a Wonderful World&#8221;, by Louis Armstrong. Sadly, Alex wasn&#8217;t in the room at the time. So I requested something more appropriate (so I thought): &#8220;Lost Together&#8221; by Blue Rodeo.<br />
Due to song planning, &#8220;Lost Together&#8221; came up at a non-dancing time (namely, the cake-cutting). It also didn&#8217;t help that Alex wouldn&#8217;t have danced to it, anyway. That left me feeling quite hollow, having finally worked up the gumption to do something about it. I hate, loathe, and despite dancing, and have done so since I was a kid. I have no idea why. So needless to say, it takes quite a lot of effort to ask someone to dance.<br />
We ended up leaving early, before almost everyone else in my family, at 23:45. (The party went on until almost 3:00.) I felt bad for leaving early. This is my family. Leaving so soon just seemed &#8230; wrong. But I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly great &#8212; the whole dancing issue had hit me harder than I thought (the only song we&#8217;d danced to was &#8220;Home for a Rest&#8221;, and it far from compensated). Going to bed, I honestly wondered what others would think. I worried what they&#8217;d say. Something didn&#8217;t seem right. But I didn&#8217;t want to mention it &#8212; just in case I was imagining things.<br />
