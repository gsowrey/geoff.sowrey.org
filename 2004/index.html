		<p>I had hoped to go some place warm for the Christmas holidays this year. I wanted to put Christmas lights on a palm tree. I wanted to make sandmen. I wanted nothing more to worry about than getting a sunburn on Boxing day.<br />
So naturally, I ended up arriving at Pearson International Airport at 6:30 on the morning of 23 December, catching the end of a nasty two-day snowstorm. There&#8217;s poetic justice in this, somewhere.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think Alex and I need to stop packing so much into a single weekend. It&#8217;s gonna kill us.<br />
Friday night was Light Night. Being fairly warm (thanks to a chinook), we went out in search of Christmas lights around town, camera in hand. There&#8217;s a lot to choose from, but one thing Alex and I noticed about Calgary &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people with too much money, and too cheap to put up lights. Something I think Alex and I will definitely work against next Christmas with our home.<br />
We went around Glamorgan, Altadore, Garrison Woods, through another section of the city I can&#8217;t remember the name of, all the way out to Discovery Ridge, and then finally into Springbank. There were only a few places that had anything of consequence. One was a string of houses in Glamorgan on a cul-de-sac that took the whole idea of Christmas lighting very seriously. That was our first stop. Ironically, it wasn&#8217;t until our last (Springbank) that we really saw something noteworthy. First were two houses on the hill (we saw them from Discovery Ridge) that had a lot of lights in the rear. Then we saw a couple houses with &#8220;ME&#8221; and &#8220;IS&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t until we took a wider look that several houses had similar letters: ME, RR, YC, HR, IS, TM, and AS. (Although the &#8220;RR&#8221; was out that night.)<br />
But one house took the biscuit. You couldn&#8217;t see their front lawn for all the lights, toys, balloons, cutouts, and whatnot erected all over it. The light was enough to be almost blinding. No music, though, so at least the sounds wouldn&#8217;t drive neighbours crazy, but the whole setup was just &#8230; well, either amazing or ridiculous. Take your choice.<br />
Saturday was a busy day, right from the start. Alex was working, having volunteered (one of four) to help out with a laboratory exercise, to help surgeons learn a new spine operation method. (Paid, of course.) This meant a (relatively) early start, and a long day in front of an x-ray machine.<br />
We went to Denny&#8217;s on 16th Ave, just east of Crowchild, for breakfast with her co-workers Andy and Fred. (Andy is an x-ray tech, like Alex; Fred leads the Quality Control (QC) effort, whom Alex works with every Wednesday.) All three (there were four in total) were working in the lab. I was just along for the big breakfast. It was my first chance to meet Fred &#8212; I finally have a face for all the stories I hear from Alex.<br />
Following breakfast, the three of them vanished off to Foothills (the hospital, not the mountains) and I headed up to Crowfoot Centre, to pick up my car. (Mini Canada had called in my car for a voluntary recall to upgrade my emissions.) This is about where my rather tiring day began.<br />
First off, I somehow managed to arrive at the Banff Trail C-Train station with a mere dollar in change. (You need two for the ticket to ride.) Don&#8217;t you just hate being in that really uncomfortably position of needing an extra bit of change, and all you have is a dollar? Luckily, one of the other patrons there offered to change my $5 bill, and then gave me a dollar after realizing he didn&#8217;t have enough for the change.<br />
I love Calgarians.<br />
It was a bit windy at the station, but the Weather Network had said that we&#8217;d have a reasonably nice day. By the time I got to Dalhousie station, it was much windier, with snow pellets. I boarded a bus to take me to Crowfoot &#8212; the #147. When I got off at the Burger King there, I was staring into a wall of white. When I walked into the Chapter&#8217;s there about five minutes after getting off the bus, the front of my body looked like someone had taken a white paint roller to me.<br />
My car was clean and shiny when I arrived, and was soon on the road. (The salt and sand from Calgary&#8217;s ongoing efforts to beat back winter were soon on my car, rather than the street.) I stopped at Chinook for the purpose of finding a particularly difficult to find present. I&#8217;d seen it there during a shopping spree Alex and I had engaged in to find her a dress, but couldn&#8217;t remember what store. Despite visiting every retailer in the building, I was unable to discover its location.<br />
Thinking that perhaps I had the wrong mall in mind, I whipped down to South Centre. Unfortunately, it didn&#8217;t seem to matter which mall I was in, the success was the same &#8212; nil. The frustration, not to mention my headache, was building.<br />
But it was time for me to head home. Alex and I were going to the Diagnostic Imagining (Alex&#8217;s department) Christmas party, and I had to get ready. This is when I noticed that my door wasn&#8217;t opening. Again. (See 22 November 2004.) This meant I had to climb in the passenger side to be able to drive. I&#8217;m seriously going to tear someone a new hole for this at the dealership (I had asked them *specifically* to look at this problem.)<br />
I stopped by Alex&#8217;s to get my gym clothes bag that I&#8217;d left there the night before. In doing so, I found yet another suprise. Either the Mini dealership had given me a very nice Christmas present, or some schmuck in the service department had left a battery charger in my trunk. Despite the drive, the door still wouldn&#8217;t open.<br />
I popped home just long enough to grab a memory card with a photo I was printing for someone (a woman wanted a copy for her boyfriend for Christmas). Up to London Drugs. Three hours before I could get it back. By that time, I&#8217;d be at the party, and with the events tomorrow, there was no way I&#8217;d be able to meet up and deliver the photo the next day. I&#8217;d need to find an alternative (I emailed the original and apologized for the delay).<br />
Door was still not working. People were giving me strange looks as I hopped across my front seat.<br />
Alex called not long after I got home. She&#8217;d finished early, and was heading home. I grabbed my things and headed to her place. She needed a massage after a day of moving around the x-ray machine, and with the night ahead, she didn&#8217;t want to be sore.<br />
We arrived at Canada Olympic Park just after 18:15, in plenty of time for the 18:30 dinner start. Mark and Sang had saved us seats (thankfully) at Table 22. (There were a LOT of tables. The DI department is quite large.) People in attendance had dressed in a fairly wide range, from not-quite-casual almost all the way to near-formal ball gowns. I knew a handful of people (folks that I&#8217;d been introduced to at the hospital, or those who&#8217;d also been on the dragon boat team), but the majority were strangers.<br />
Colette was the ring leader, and made most of the announcements. She also called tables, the numbers drawn at random, to go for dinner. Last year, Alex&#8217;s table had been called last. We were fifth or sixth in the list. Roast beef, chicken, lots of sides to choose from &#8212; all very tasty. While we ate, the door prizes were handed out.<br />
This is where my luck truly showed through &#8230; or the complete and utter lack of it. We&#8217;d all put our names in the hat, so to speak, which were drawn at random. You were then given a random prize. I had made the mistake, however, of trusting my table-mates not to dupe me. I went to the bathroom when Colette started collecting the names. When I got back, Alex handed me two pieces of paper, telling me that she&#8217;d missed Colette when she&#8217;d passed by. Colette told me: &#8220;Only once, Geoff!&#8221;<br />
I was confused. What was wrong with missing her? Easy &#8230; Alex and Mark decided to stuff the ballots with MY NAME. So if I got called more than once, *I&#8217;d* be the one who got in trouble. Gee, thanks, guys&#8230;<br />
As it turns out, I shouldn&#8217;t have worried. My luck is that bad. In a 100 ticket lottery, I&#8217;d lose even if I&#8217;d bought 99 tickets. Alex and Mark were dumbfounded. I challenged Alex to draw my name out of the bag within 20 tries. She couldn&#8217;t.<br />
We left not long after 22:30, having both run out of steam. It had been a long day.<br />
Allowing a bit of a chance to sleep in, we ended up rushing to make it to Grace Presbyterian on time. (Yep, another Advent Sunday means another church.) This particular event wasn&#8217;t so much for the service, but for the cantata (a musical composition for voices and orchestra based on a religious text). At Grace, this would be a great event, as it is one of Calgary&#8217;s oldest churches (it turns 100 near year). There&#8217;s a big pipe organ, and a large orchestra was assembled for the performance.<br />
The senior minister, Rev. Victor Kim, performed what he described as his &#8220;shortest sermon of the year&#8221; (received by much laughter), followed by the longest sermon of the year &#8212; the cantata. The choir came down from their perch in front of the organ, to a series of risers in front of the podium. The orchestra geared up, and the cantata began.<br />
It was a 15-song concert (including the closing hymn of &#8220;Joyful and Triumphant&#8221;), with most of the song sung by the main choir. (The children sang two of the songs.) The entire choir participated, although several of the songs had solos. I&#8217;m not sure if the soloists were part of the regular congregation &#8212; if the are, then Grace has some seriously gifted singers in their midst.<br />
The service started at 11:00, and we left just after 13:00. The air was cold and brisk, though not nearly as bad as the nasty cold snap we&#8217;d had a few days earlier (minus 20 is not pleasant, I don&#8217;t care who you are). We were going to go for tea at Steeps, but ended up hitting Janice Beaton (for lavender shortbread and some really nice cheese), then ended up stopping at a few stores and restaurants before getting to Fiore&#8217;s for a late lunch. Stops at several more stores (including Gravity Pope and Reid&#8217;s) took up enough time that getting tea wasn&#8217;t really an option anymore. We were wiped.<br />
We rested a while at Alex&#8217;s before I went out again to go pickup Jen. Jen turned 16, and I had not yet got her a birthday present (yes, I know, I&#8217;m a lousy cousin). So I took Jen out for dinner, a couple games, and ultimately (which was the original reason) to see &#8220;Ghost In The Shell 2: Innocence&#8221;, a Japanese anime film about &#8230; hmm, actually, I&#8217;m not going to describe it. That&#8217;s an entire email onto its own.<br />
Alex, sadly, was not able to come out, which would have been good. I could have used her skill to help defeat Jen at air hockey. Mind you, that could have been retribution for the embarassment of letting Peter (at Sumo) know it was her birthday. There&#8217;s nothing like a bunch of Japanese wait staff singing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; and &#8220;I Just Called (To Say I Love You)&#8221; &#8212; loudly &#8212; to make you feel like the centre of attention.<br />
The movie was long, but good. I think I need to see it again to really wrap my head around it, though. The basic plot line was easy enough to follow, but some of the more intricate details were &#8230; well, reading subtitles and follow action with deep dialogue isn&#8217;t easy.<br />
It was late when I finally got home. I was tired. Really tired. It&#8217;s been a long weekend. And it&#8217;s going to be a long week.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a while, hasn&#8217;t it? No, I&#8217;m not dead. I wasn&#8217;t abducted by aliens. I wasn&#8217;t held hostage. I took a bit of a break. I had to.<br />
In mid-September, I suffered a bit of a breakdown. Too much stress that I&#8217;d allowed to work into my life caught up with me and brought the Geoff Sowrey Machine to a grinding halt. Thankfully, that didn&#8217;t last too long, and was able to get back up and running not long afterwards. So why did I take such a long break before writing again?<br />
Well, one thing that bucket o&#8217; stress did was really hamper my ability to write and edit properly. I was afraid that such a thing was happening, but didn&#8217;t really think it was harming me. Sadly, after one particular entry about my cousin Pam&#8217;s wedding, it became all-too-clear that my ability to write was in jeopardy. I unintentionally insulted my family &#8212; a grievous error for which I am deeply regretful. That brought an end to my writing, at least until I felt competant enough to write again.<br />
Which brings me to this weekend&#8230; (relax, events of weeks, er, months past will be brought to the web as soon as I can edit them all together)<br />
The weekend couldn&#8217;t have started soon enough for me &#8212; last week was almost nothing except planning, strategy, writing, and a lot of stress (long story, which I&#8217;m not really going to get into, suffice to say that the issues were resolved). Friday night was nice: a couple of beers starting at 16:30 (we celebrated a &#8220;No-one Got Fired&#8221; day), followed by a brief stop to wish my friend Angie a happy birthday. Then it was off home to wash off the smell of &#8220;Fuel&#8221; (where the start of Angie&#8217;s party was) and wait for Alex to come home.<br />
We woke up earlier on Saturday than we had in previous weeks, and immediately got to the task of the morning: breakfast. But we opted for breakfast at Nellie&#8217;s In The Loop; one of the Nellie&#8217;s restaurants, based in Marda Loop. We had thought of going to the Belvedere Diner (across the road), but the lineups pretty much settled that deal. Food in our bellies, we aimed for stop #2: Chinook Centre.<br />
As you already know, it&#8217;s December. It&#8217;s Christmas season. So not only were we looking for presents for others (I&#8217;m not quite done yet), we were looking for outfits for the various Christmas parties that are coming up, most notably the MRT party next Saturday. Alex needed a dress. For those of you who&#8217;ve never shopped for a dress before, you&#8217;d be surprised how hard it is to not only find one that looks good, but doesn&#8217;t scratch your skin (Alex found one that seemed to be made ENTIRELY of sparkles), but also comes in your size. Despite a mall-wide search, we ended up finding one in Sears, of all places. I settled for a new dress shirt and a tie, in colours that would compliment Alex&#8217;s navy-blue and silver outfit.<br />
Although December, Chinook wasn&#8217;t wall-to-wall people when we arrived. However, as we began to head towards the Sears (where we ultimatlely found the dress), we noticed that the population was growing exponentially. Having completed our transactions in Sears, we headed towards the car, and abandoned the mall with all due haste.<br />
Destination? Heritage Park, for their 12 Days of Christmas weekend. (It&#8217;s actually several weekends.) Basically, it&#8217;s the same as the park usually, except the amusement park is closed, the trains aren&#8217;t running, and the theme around most of the buildings is decidedly Christmas. It&#8217;s quite nice, actually, and with a bit of planning, could be something that Alex and I make a tradition. Especially when we have kids.<br />
Yes, we talk extensively about having kids. Prepare for it, folks.<br />
We found some particularly nice things in one store, especially drink mixes (powders for hot apple and cranberry ciders, hot chocolates of various varieties), candies, and fudge (we&#8217;re fudge-o-holics). In an adjoining building, we found a group of calligraphers, who whipped off pretty much anything you needed or wanted. That&#8217;s where we ran into Rebecca&#8217;s mom (who travels in the calligraphy circles in Calgary).<br />
The Wainwright Hotel was open, but the forecast for food was a little bleak. Hot dogs in one room, and an apparent lineup for the other. So we aborted and looked elsewhere, such as the bakery (basically, nothing but cookies), the Club Cafe (didn&#8217;t really hit us), and Gunn&#8217;s Dairy Farm (closed by the time we got there). The roundhouse was also open, though didn&#8217;t have any food &#8212; instead, had a wide range of gift ideas. Most were arranged in international themes, so one would see Christmas from various parts of the world, with little descriptions about that area.<br />
One thing that stood out for me was the description of the true meaning of the &#8220;Twelve Days of Christmas&#8221;. Most people think this is about one person giving presents to another. In reality, it was a song created to help teach the core of Catholicism to children during a period in English history when being a Catholic was considered bad. Like, lock you away for a very long time kind of bad. The practice went on from 1558 to 1829, when Catholics were finally emancipated. Here&#8217;s how the numbers actually break down (text borrowed from Appleseeds.org, &#8216;cuz I&#8217;m too damn lazy to type it all out):</p>
<ul>
<li>1st Day: The partridge in a pear tree is Christ Jesus upon the Cross. In the song, Christ is symbolically presented as a mother partridge because she would feign injury to decoy a predator away from her nestlings. She was even willing to die for them. The tree is the symbol of the fall of the human race through the sin of Adam and Eve. It is also the symbol of its redemption by Jesus Christ on the tree of the Cross.</li>
<li>2nd Day:The &#8220;two turtle doves&#8221; refers to the Old and New Testaments.</li>
<li>3rd Day:The &#8220;three French hens&#8221; stand for faith, hope and love &#8212; the three gifts of the Spirit that abide (1 Corinthians 13).</li>
<li>4th Day:The &#8220;four calling birds&#8221; refers to the four evangelists who wrote the Gospels &#8212; Matthew, Mark, Luke and John &#8212; which sing the song of salvation through Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>5th Day:The &#8220;five golden rings&#8221; represents the first five books of the Bible, also called the Jewish Torah: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.</li>
<li>6th Day:The &#8220;six geese a-laying&#8221; is the six days of creation.</li>
<li>7th Day:The &#8220;seven swans a-swimming&#8221; refers to the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.</li>
<li>8th Day:The &#8220;eight maids a milking &#8221; reminded children of the eight beatitudes listed in the Sermon on the Mount.</li>
<li>9th Day:The &#8220;nine ladies dancing&#8221; were the nine fruits of the Holy Spirit found in Galatians 5:22-23: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control.</li>
<li>10th Day:The &#8220;ten lords a-leaping&#8221; represents the Ten Commandments</li>
<li>11th Day:The &#8220;eleven pipers piping&#8221; refers to the eleven faithful apostles.</li>
<li>12th Day:The Ã¯ ¿ ½twelve drummers drumming&#8221; were the twelve points of belief expressed in the ApostlesÃ¯ ¿ ½ Creed: belief in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, that Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary, made man, crucified, died and arose on the third day, that he sits at the right hand of the father and will come again, the resurrection of the dead and life everlasting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learn something new every day, eh?<br />
Afterwards, we headed out in search of food. Alex was starting to gnaw on my arm, and I felt it important to keep my limbs intact. As we headed back to the Hotel, we could hear the carolers on the stage belting out song after song. But one of them caught our attention. They were singing &#8220;Linus and Lucy&#8221;, the single-most recognizable tune from &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;.<br />
Yes, singing.<br />
As there are no words to the song, they were singing &#8220;do do do do do do do&#8221;, broken into women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s parts. There&#8217;s a bit after the first two stanzas where all of them sang &#8220;DA DA DA DA!&#8221; and followed the sound of the piano. Alex and I about fell over laughing, it sounded so ridiculous.<br />
All we got at the Hotel was a warm dog (not quite hot), two bags of chips, and a couple of drinks. Unsatisfied, we tried for gingerbread cookies at the bakery. You could have used them to armour-plate a tank. The sheer horrors of food having set it, and our interest waning, we headed off in search of the car, and new shopping experiences &#8230; at South Centre Mall.<br />
South Centre was far less busy than Chinook had been, though we didn&#8217;t make any huge scores (although Alex did find a shawl-like thing (it&#8217;s hard to describe, needless to say) for her outfit next Saturday. Following the mall, we headed over to the adjacent Safeway for dinner fixin&#8217;s and for eggs, to make better gingerbread than the armour plating we&#8217;d had earlier.<br />
Dinner eaten and gingerbread dough cooling, we went to return one movie (&#8220;Bad Santa&#8221;) and rent a new one (&#8220;Monster&#8221;). This became partial entertainment. It&#8217;s been snowing this weekend, and the temperature on Saturday was enough to turn the Edmonton Trail hill into a bit of an ice rink. And that seems to attract every idiot in town to prove that you can, in fact, get up an icy hill merely by putting your foot to the floor and smoking your tires beyond repair. Morons.<br />
We were a little late arriving at church the next morning, owing to the aforementioned cold and snow. (The roads were a little treacherous, and it really doesn&#8217;t help matters when the Calgary Police Service decides to pull someone on Memorial over right at a curve in the road. They caused more accidents than they were trying to stop.)<br />
Why did we go to church? Alex wanted to, for one, but also because I&#8217;ve never seen a Christmas service before. It&#8217;s something new for me, and it&#8217;s a part of Alex&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s fun to share experiences, don&#8217;t you think? Following church, we headed to Market Mall for lunch and, yes, more shopping. (We stopped along the way to drop off a small batch of gingerbread cookies to the X-Ray staff in Emergency at the Foot.)<br />
A bag of clothes (I needed new shirts) and two digesting ice cream cones (from the Marble Slab Creamery) later, we returned to my place via Safeway to make dinner: pizza. Something quick. We were heading out to the Knox Choir Festival at Knox United downtown, and were meeting up with Rebecca at the Tim Horton&#8217;s a block away. Which was good, because it was about -20 tonight. Brrr.<br />
The three of us arrived at the church about 15 minutes before the show started. It was packed, wall-to-wall, including the balconies. We barely managed to find seats in the upper back. The show was recorded by CBC radio for rebroadcast in the Calgary area. It was interesting to watch the various choirs come in and play carols I&#8217;d never even heard of before. Two particular choirs were the Korean Presbyterian Choir (which sang traditional English carols in Korean, and sounded amazing) and the Chinook Show Choir, a collection of older women who sang just beautifully. We, as the audience, sang in between the choirs with the Knox Choir and a really loud organ.<br />
Dad would have loved it.<br />
Oh, and one of those choirs decided to do &#8220;A Charlie Brown Christmas&#8221;. Yep, how often do you hear people singing &#8220;Linus and Lucy&#8221; twice in one weekend? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever gonna get it out of my head.<br />
Christmas is definitely here. This is going to be a great Christmas season.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Someone had the brilliant idea to go hiking in Kananaskis. Apparently this person didn&#8217;t realize that it&#8217;s almost winter. (And around here, that means it <em>is</em> winter.)<br />
We all started off at Phil&#8217;s on 16th Ave. Alex and I were meeting up with a couple of Alex&#8217;s co-workers for a bite to eat before heading off. Originally, Alex and I weren&#8217;t going hiking. It&#8217;s cold, and that means hiking is &#8230; well &#8230; uncomfortable. Alex had other ideas, and though I didn&#8217;t know what they were, they pretty much excluded hiking.<br />
Breakfast changed those plans. So after finishing, we drove at a break-neck pace to Alex&#8217;s for warmer clothes, then bolted out to Upper Lake in Kananaskis park. Despite the cool weather (about -6), there were a surprising number of people there already. We tried to catch up with the rest of the group, but they were already quite a ways along. (I drive fast, but Andy apparently drives faster.) Alex and I were left to ourselves.<br />
We started from the boat launch and walked all the way around until the sluice gate on the far side near to where we&#8217;d camped in the summer (see [[Birthday Camping in Kananaskis]]). We passed a few people as we walked along, but most of the time it was just us, the breeze, and the cold silence of the mountains. It&#8217;s breath-taking.<br />
It&#8217;s also freezing. I wasn&#8217;t too affected, but Alex&#8217;s chattering could probably be heard for miles. (Kidding, honey &#8212; honest!)<br />
We met up with Andy just before we got to the sluice gate, where we headed to the road. We took the road back to the boat launch, managing to catch up with Andy on his return trip. But instead of continuing to follow Andy back to Calgary, we headed towards Canmore. It was time for another surprise&#8230;<br />
We got a cabin. A small one, nothing fancy. Well, the first one was small and nothing fancy until we&#8217;d realized that he hadn&#8217;t cleaned it yet. We were moved to a more rustic one next door that was slightly more than chilly. The gas fireplace would have to be turned way up to make it bearable.<br />
There was a party going on in Banff (Bamf!). We had no idea that there was one. We didn&#8217;t even know what it was called until we found someone who explained: WinterStart. Something to make people feel excited about the lack of sunshine (the sun effectively sets about 15:30 due to the mountains) and the cold (even though Banff is often warmer than Calgary).<br />
First up: Fudge. It&#8217;s a tradition.<br />
Then it was winter hats for Alex. This at times feels almost like beating one&#8217;s head against a wall. We&#8217;ll find one for her eventually, I&#8217;m sure. But it&#8217;s gonna take a lot of hats before she&#8217;s happy.<br />
Dinner at Old Spaghetti Factory. It ain&#8217;t what it used to be, and the food did a number on Alex. We ended up abandoning the rest of our meal and headed back to the cabin where I spent my time trying to keep Alex warm.<br />
It was pure irony then that the shower ran out of hot water as I was finishing the next morning. (Ouch.) Back to Banff (Bamf!) for breakfast at Phil&#8217;s, then up to the hot springs to really warm up. More fudge. Dinner was in Canmore &#8212; Boston Pizza.<br />
Extremes of such cold and heat should give one the flu. So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days! </p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Shrub is back for another four years. Oh. Joy.<br />
Did no-one realize what kind of moron is at the head of the US Government? I can only guess not, as the United States again voted in one of the most dangerous men on the planet. The guy freaks me out. Arrogant, ignorant, and brash. A bad combination for a politician.<br />
The problem is the Democrats. They need to find someone with more personality than a telephone pole. Kerry, in case you haven&#8217;t noticed, is rather dull. Actually, nix that. Gore was rather dull. Kerry is Xanax incarnate. If you have any hope against charisma (no matter how evil it seems), you need to put in someone who can at least look and sound more than a mere talking head!<br />
Bush had my favourite line-to-hate from politicians: &#8220;America has spoken&#8221;. Spoken. With 51% of the vote. That&#8217;s not really saying much when you consider that <em>every second person voted against you</em>! If that&#8217;s what you call speaking up in a crowd, it&#8217;s no wonder you&#8217;re not listening to your constituents.<br />
Oh, right, you are listening. Corporate America and ill-gotten influence. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Let&#8217;s recap on Bush&#8217;s first term: After 9/11 (and his reputed 40% vacation time), he drums up the support to go after Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Makes a complete mess by forcing out the Taliban and is unable to find the person he&#8217;s looking for. Yells at Canada for not helping. (Take a guess who&#8217;s going to spend decades keeping the peace after you&#8217;re gone, ya yutz?)<br />
Unable to stop Bin Laden, but still needing a victory, goes after Iraq and Saddam Hussein, the &#8220;most dangerous man alive&#8221;.<br />
Hussein. In the Iraqi economic wasteland. Dangerous to whom? Even Israel says he&#8217;s more of a minor irritation externally. He&#8217;s more dangerous to himself with his paranoia and germophobia.<br />
Oh, right. Corporate America. Oil. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Claims of weapons of mass destruction are realized to be mere words: weapons of mass <em>distraction</em> to give Bush the &#8220;right&#8221; to wreak havoc and kill a lot of innocent people. And you think Hussein is dangerous? Boy, look in the mirror sometime.<br />
Yet again, the US has to go in en masse to clean up a puppet they set up before and let run amok. (Witness Noriega and Castro.) Some regimes never learn.<br />
Interestingly enough, the world (courtesy of globalvote.org) voted for Kerry. We hoped that Kerry would be a tad more honest and wouldn&#8217;t be so keen to wage war on another country somewhere. Sadly, given his waffling, the US ended up with a &#8220;devil you don&#8217;t know&#8221; problem. What would Kerry actually do?<br />
So welcome to another four years of hollow rhetoric, shallow lies, and more fodder for late night talk show hosts and documentary filmmakers. Let&#8217;s just hope this doesn&#8217;t go anymore to his head than it already has.<br />
Oh, and I have to ask, what&#8217;s with Americans turning so homophobic &#8212; what&#8217;s the big deal, eh?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another busy weekend at hand. Where oh where to start?<br />
I guess first off, I&#8217;ve finally had to give up my old Nokia brick cell phone. My faithful and antique companion has served me well since arriving in Calgary so many years ago. But the battery has a finite lifespan and has finally tanked. I can keep a charge for about a half-day now. Kind of makes it not worth my while.<br />
So while Alex and I were wandering about Market Mall, we stopped into the Telus store to see if I could get a replacement battery. Quelle surprise, none to be had. I had to buck down, pay the $50 and get a new one. But while we were discussing this, Alex started ogling a nice blue LG phone.<br />
Until today, Alex didn&#8217;t carry a cell phone. Her only cell phone (a duplicate of mine) ended up with Allen (her father), who still uses it. But with couples always trying to stay in contact, it seemed useful. Alex wasn&#8217;t sure, but ultimate caved when we realized the advantages. I think she&#8217;ll use it, but only time will tell.<br />
I had to work a bit this weekend &#8212; MB is a fun client that never seems to keep me bored. It wasn&#8217;t a lot of work, so it still allowed me to do some grocery shopping (including a pumpkin) and make dinner for Alex. Notably because last night was Hallowe&#8217;en!<br />
Beef stew is a new &#8220;specialty&#8221; of mine, I think. Considering it&#8217;s my first, I think it&#8217;s pretty good. Alex inhaled hers. The fact that it was served in a bread bowl probably has nothing to do with that, though&#8230; (inside joke, trust me).<br />
Not many kids disturbed our dinner. We watched TV with the lights out so it was easier to see out the window for incoming rug rats. This continued until I got a phone call from Tamara who apparently had fainted on the C-Train. I raced down to the station at Stampede to pick her up from the ambulance where she was waiting. She looked a little shaken but otherwise fine. Low blood sugar it seemed. A bit of food and all would be well.<br />
I hope the week coming up ain&#8217;t this busy!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We had 2005 planning meetings this week, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. They can be quite painful, if for no reason other than for going over projects all day. It really wears on the brain, and the body. Well, my body, anyway. I have to drink Coke to focus well, since these meetings have a tendency to cause my brain to tune out. At the end of Wednesday, I was exhausted. It also didn&#8217;t help that I was having to stay late to catch up on work I was unable to do during the day.<br />
But as is typical with these annual meetings, we usually have an annual team building event. There were no green alligators or long-necked geese this year (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]), which I&#8217;m partially thankful for. (That had been a lot of fun, but I felt quite hungover the next day &#8230; not that today is going all that swimmingly, I might add.)<br />
Following the end of our work day, those of us on the Mercedes-Benz USA account high-tailed it over to Eau Claire Market and the Cinescape, an arcade/lounge attached to the Cineplex Odeon theatre. We didn&#8217;t know exactly what was in store for us, especially since Scott, Torin, and I were the first to arrive.<br />
Somehow, though, we stuck out like a giraffe in a penguin parade, and a very helpful server by the name of Nigel came to our rescue. We had two pool tables, a series of tables, and an unlimited bar tab at our disposal, with food coming along shortly thereafter.<br />
Let the party begin.<br />
By 18:00, most of those who would be attending had arrived. Although the team numbers about 60, maybe only 2/3 of them showed up. While we waited for dinner, we played pool (I got smoked by Torin and Casey, who are both pool sharks) and chatted amongst ourselves. Some of the designers played darts (which, after Luke&#8217;s going away party &#8212; see [[Luke leaves Critical Mass]] &#8212; I had decided I was going to avoid).<br />
Dinner was quite good &#8212; much better than I had expected. Salads, buns, mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and chicken or salmon (or both, if you prefered). It tasted great, even standing up. While we ate, the rules of the game were explained&#8230;<br />
Each of us were given $1,000 in Monopoly money (photocopied, mind you) and 40 game tokens. The idea was to bet each other on games and try win as much money as possible. We were divided into teams, and the team with the most money at the end won the bragging rights. (As it stands, it&#8217;s up for debate which team ultimately ended up winning, no doubt in part to the quantities of alcohol consumed.)<br />
Not being a betting man, myself (I follow the wise words of Jack Burton: When the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake, just look that big old storm right in the eye and say, &#8220;Give me your best shot. I can take it!&#8221; &#8230; no wait, wrong quote &#8230; I never bet my money, only my life). I pocketed the whole wad in my back pocket and played dumb the rest of the evening.<br />
For those of you who know me, I can play dumb real well.<br />
I finally beat Adrian in a game of air hockey. It&#8217;s taken a while. It was a hard-fought game, with both of us sending the puck in multiple directions off the table. The score came down to 7-6. It would be the last time I choose to challenge Adrian last night. (I would take Scott later on, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly who won &#8230; it was probably him.) I jumped in and out of games throughout the night, until all my tokens (including a healthy refill from Dan) were depleted. My trigger finger hurt.<br />
Talking and boasting continued until the lounge closed, and we all headed over to the Barley Mill to continue. Now, true believers, this is where things get a tad hazy, because I&#8217;m not entirely sure how long we were there for. I do remember one beer and playing a game where you try to guess what three words have in common (quite a good game, I might add). But that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t think we were there very long before we all upped and headed for Chinese.<br />
We lost two along the way, but Dan was still leading the charge. We ended up at Me and U, on the corner of 3rd Ave. and Centre Street. I&#8217;d never been there before, but it seemed like fun. Or would have. You see, as soon as I sat down and had my first cup of tea, my body started to rebel. I went to the bathroom and stood over the sink for about 10 minutes before Dan came to find me. I&#8217;d officially had the buscuit, and headed home.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what happened. I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d had that much. Maybe I did, and just don&#8217;t remember. Either way, though, the walk home wasn&#8217;t pleasant. I wasn&#8217;t sick, just really dizzy. It wasn&#8217;t like any enbriated state I&#8217;d experienced. Mind you, my memory was a little off, so it wasn&#8217;t easy to tell.<br />
Speaking of memory, mine was so shot that I didn&#8217;t wake up until 8:30, thanks to Tamara making noise in the bathroom. Crap. I hauled ass and was out of the house in less than 10 minutes, arriving at work just over an hour late. I depleted the Bistro&#8217;s supply of ginger ale. Ate several slices of banana bread. But it wasn&#8217;t until the greasy A&amp;W lunch that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Thank god we only do this once a year&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept horribly. I&#8217;m not sure if it was from the hiking we&#8217;d done yesterday, or the troubling thoughts running through my mind as a result of last night. I&#8217;d felt like Alex and I had been abandoned for breakfast, as well, with everyone but us having done up to Uncle David and Aunt Alaine&#8217;s suite for muffins, coffee, and juice. I suddenly felt like we&#8217;d been completely excluded. It left a very hollow feeling with me.<br />
Alex and I headed up to the restaurant, which was where we&#8217;d agreed to go with everyone else for brunch. We sat there for a while, wondering where everyone was. The feeling that we were being shunned as a result of last night wasn&#8217;t going away. It wasn&#8217;t until they (Cathy, Craig, Mom, Brenda, Mike, and Nana &#8212; Jen slept in) appeared from Dave and Alaine&#8217;s suite that I started to feel a little more normal.<br />
We gorged ourselves on breakfast. I started to feel better, and put off the negative thoughts as nothing more than paranoia. When brunch finally rolled to a close, Alex and I headed up to Dave and Alaine&#8217;s suite to bid a good morning, and farewell. I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be seeing them before they headed back to Kelowna, so it was the best possible chance. (As it turns out, we saw them again that evening.) Pam and Sean were there, still wired from the events of yesterday, despite barely four hours of sleep. The large room (which contained a sitting area and small kitchen-like space) was littered with fruit and muffins, juice, and chocolate milk (for, guess who?).<br />
Hanging around for a little while (and being joined by the others) to chat a bit, we then returned to our rooms to pack up. It took a bit of effort to get everyone put away (a few trips were needed for Mike and Brenda&#8217;s room alone). Once our stuff was away, we helped pack up the remainders from last night &#8212; plates and leftover liquor, wine, and beer. All of it went into Mike&#8217;s truck (borrowed for the purposes of transportation).<br />
Packing complete, Alex and I departed to do some shopping. The only thing on our list? Jeans, for Alex. We hit several stores before tag-teaming almost the entire selection at The Bay (yes, believe it or not, there is a Bay in Banff). Jeans in hand, we stopped next at the Old Spaghetti Factory for a late lunch.<br />
&#8220;Late&#8221; being the operative word. I didn&#8217;t realize what time it was until we left. We needed to be at Mike and Brenda&#8217;s house for 17:00 to help move a couch. We didn&#8217;t even depart Banff (Bamf!) until almost 15:45, having needed to take a sidetrip to take a photo of the Banff Springs from Surprise Corner. It was still snowing when we finally left the protection of the mountains. Calgary would be under a blanket of snow.<br />
The couch had been moved by the time we got there. The group of us, joined soon after Alex and I arrived by Dave and Alaine, returning the truck, moved into the living room for pizza and a slideshow of the photos we&#8217;d taken. Craig, Mom, Mike, and I ran through our collective sets, describing them as needed.<br />
It got to be late. I want to be up early tomorrow to hit the gym &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a weekend of overeating to work off. So we prepared to leave. That&#8217;s when I found out that Cathy and Craig are staying at a hotel tonight. I felt a little cheated, having found out at that point. I understood their reason (without having to ask), but suddenly felt like they were avoiding me. Yeah, there&#8217;s that paranoia again.<br />
No biggie, though. I&#8217;ll see them tomorrow for lunch. Assuming, of course, that all hell doesn&#8217;t break loose.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The schedule had been for breakfast at 9:00. Cathy and Craig weren&#8217;t terribly happy about that (it is early, after all, especially after being out drinking most of the night), but were up and running before Alex and I. We barely pulled ourselves out of bed in time. Jen, of course, slept right through breakfast.<br />
Melissa&#8217;s is a Banff (Bamf!) landmark, and right across the street from the Banff Park Lodge. It&#8217;s a small restaurant, but had been in Banff (Bamf!) for ages. The owners, as a result, also own some of the other local properties. Melissa&#8217;s also hosts an annual road race.<br />
Packed full of food, we returned to the hotel to figure out our day&#8217;s activities. Last night, Mike and Craig declared that they were going to hike Sulphur Mountain. Having already done that this year (see [[Jazz Up Your Weekend at the Banff Centre]]), Alex and I were content to do differently. Based on a suggestion, we headed off in search of Johnston Canyon.<br />
Johnston Canyon is a little, out of the way hike about 20 minutes west of Banff, along Highway 1A (note, it&#8217;s NOT off the Trans Canada). I love driving down Highway 1A, as it&#8217;s not only a nice trip, but the road is all twisty and windy. In a small car, say a Mini, it&#8217;s a lot of fun.<br />
When you&#8217;re driving around in most national parks, you&#8217;ll periodically see cars parked at the side of the road, for no apparent reason. Take the opportunity to slow down and look around. Chances are, there&#8217;s a good wildlife opportunity. In our case, it was a bull elk, grazing not 10 metres away from the highway. Although he didn&#8217;t cooperate (staying behind bushes), I did manage to snap a couple of interesting pictures before we headed on.<br />
The parking lot at the foot of the Johnston Canyon hiking trail was nearly empty. Despite being almost 11:00, it seemed few were out for the morning hike. Being a bit chilly (the temperature was reading about 4 degree Celsius in the car), we made sure we were adequately bundled up before heading off.<br />
The Canyon trail is quite interesting. Unlike most of the trails that I&#8217;ve been on, especially within Banff National Park, this one was paved. It wasn&#8217;t smooth pavement, to be sure (so don&#8217;t think that a regular wheelchair would make the journey easily &#8230; though you could probably take one quite some distance before you hit the stairs), but it was easier than compacted gravel.<br />
Once you get into the canyon, the pavement stops and starts. In places where there is no pavement, there are extensive steel and concrete catwalks that run along the canyon walls. Never in my life would have I expected to see such a thing. There is one thing about building walkways and bridges over creeks and rivers, but to build a catwalk system into the depths of the canyon, sinking pylons into the canyons walls and floor, just so people could go look was just incredulous. It seems, to me at least, to be completely AGAINST the policies of Parks Canada, which I had always viewed as &#8220;minimal impact&#8221;.<br />
In fact, there was even a work crew there adding a new catwalk section.<br />
Rants about the impact on the environment aside, the Canyon is gorgeous. Despite clouds pretty much having obscured the sky, and some of the higher hills around the canyon, the inside seemed immune to the lack of sunshine. After a couple of turns in the canyon, it was clear why Parks Canada was installing the catwalk &#8212; there is no better way to see such beauty. The water there is clear; it looks almost like thick, turbulent air. If there is no glare from the sky, you can see every feature to the bottom, and sometimes it&#8217;s hard to tell that water&#8217;s even there.<br />
Johnston Canyon is home to several waterfalls of various heights. There are two of particular note: the Lower and Upper falls. The Lower Falls features a large, deep bowl carved out of the rocky walls. Erosion over the eons has also carved out a small tunnel on the east side of Johnston Creek, though which you can see the falls much more closely. The Upper Falls, which marked the turning point for us on our hike, is the highest in the Canyon. There are higher ones in the Banff/Yoho/Jasper park system (Takakkaw Falls &#8212; see [[BC Vacation: Three Valley Gap to Calgary]]), but these you can get really close to, thanks to a catwalk that extends right out over the creek, facing the falls.<br />
As we began our trek back to the car, it began to snow. It&#8217;s October in the mountains, which means winter. Last year, Calgary got its first snowfall on 29 October (see [[Calgary&#8217;s first heavy snowfall of the season]]). I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s snowing there now, but it&#8217;s certainly snowing here in Banff (Bamf!). The snow wasn&#8217;t the soft, fluffy stuff, either. It was those hard little pellets that bounce off your face. They sting a bit.<br />
There was barely anything on the ground by the time we got to the car, but on the drive back it was clear that the snow would be staying around a while. So was that elk we saw earlier, except now he was just lying down at the side of the road, about 8 metres from where he&#8217;d been eating, out in clear view. He was staring at something &#8212; presumably his harem &#8212; but we couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was.<br />
Arriving back in Banff (Bamf!), we went out in search of three things: food, fudge, and a navel ring (for Alex, not me). Food was at Bruno&#8217;s, because you simply can&#8217;t get better sweet potato fries anywhere else. We split a hamburger. As for fudge, we were thwarted at Rocky Mountain, which had mysteriously closed. We had to default to the Fudgery, which we think we&#8217;re going to stop patroning. Their slices are too large, and often quite dry. The ring was from the rock and gem store.<br />
Showered, shaved, dressed, we left for the wedding ceremony at about 15:45. There were two possible locations for the wedding, one at the gazebo next to the Bow River, and inside the Whyte Museum in the event of inclement weather. Given that it was snowing fairly hard, and below the magic temperature threshold of 14 degrees, we were to be inside.<br />
Incidentally, there was no irony lost that it should snow on Pam&#8217;s wedding day. Pam, who like her father (Uncle David), does not like the cold. Actually, that&#8217;s putting it mildly. To say simple say that would be to imply that Florida had only a few minor rain showers this year. Pam throws on fleece sweaters in the middle of summer when the sun goes down.<br />
The ceremony was in a small room at the back of the museum, about 30 feet by 30 feet, part of which was taken up with a stairwell. Most of the guests were crammed into the room, waiting to see what would happen. A small podium on the west side, next to the window, would be the focus of attention. We gathered ourselves around it.<br />
Before long, a man in his 40s spoke up. I thought it was the justice of the peace. It turned out to be Rod, Sean&#8217;s brother. It was then explained that Rod and Darren (Pam&#8217;s brother) were sharing the duties of officiating the wedding. (The story goes that they managed to squeak in through changes in Alberta&#8217;s officiating process. They had the ability to marry only Pam and Sean, and only today. Talk about specificity.)<br />
It was a civil affair, so there wasn&#8217;t the same level of spirituality one would get in a church. Rod was an eloquent speaker, and had little difficulty with his part of the ceremony. Darren, not being quite the public speaker, had a bit of a waver in the voice, and stumbled at a couple of parts. For the record, so did Sean and Pam as they recited their vows. The vows, incidentally, contained the typical requirements: love, devotion, commitment through thick &#8216;n thin, and so forth. They also contained a couple of unique items: Sean had to keep Pam warm, and Pam had to make sure to find healthy chocolate milk for Sean.<br />
With the ceremony over, the photographs began immediately. The photographer, who had been running around during the ceremony, now took control. First in order was a group photograph of the 90-odd people in attendance. It took a bit of organization, trying to fit everyone into the photo so that all could be seen. It wasn&#8217;t an easy shot, especially considering the small size of the room, but she managed to get all the guests into the shot. With that, the next round of photos with friends started. The family, which included Alex and I, retreated to a room downstairs to sip champagne and eat chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for our turn.<br />
The family photos were done in two rounds: Tisdales and Wades. The photographer had us all line up very specifically, and posed us all for the scene. It was quite interesting, and I dared not move, lest ruin the picture. It didn&#8217;t take long, and the photos were over for us. The Wade clan came next, and the pictures were over.<br />
Calling upon Darren and Ginny for a moment, Alex and I had our picture taken on one of the several rooms of the museum, against a backdrop reminiscent of the cliffs you see along the Trans Canada highway, just east of the east entrance to the Banff (Bamf!) townsite.<br />
With that, we headed back to the hotel in the still-falling snow. After a quick stop at the hotel room (Alex wanted to change, and I wanted to ditch some of things I was carrying), we headed up to the Glacier Salon, site of the reception party. Although officially to start at 17:30, we were a little early. That ended up being a bit fortuitous, since Mike needed an experiment couple to practice on for the photos. Mike was taking pictures of every person who came to the reception.<br />
The photos were at the fireplace that dominated half of the north wall. (The other half was a frosted glass wall, cut and etched to represent the surrounding mountains. It barely went up a quarter of the height of the massive vaulted ceiling.) Windows ran down the length of the east wall, to a dance area at the southern end. The bar also ran along the south wall, but jutting well into the room (separating the dance floor from everything else). The west wall was windowed (with blinds) and had the doors to the rest of the hotel.<br />
Ten tables filled the room, one head table and nine guest tables. Each had eight seats. Cathy, Craig, Alex, and I were relegated to table #9 &#8212; the last one. It was probably the single safest move to make.<br />
Guests were arriving, mingling, drinking, eating hors d&#8217;ouevres, and generally being merry. Not long after, Sean and Pam arrived, having had their photos taken at the Gazebo. I can only imagine how cold Pam must&#8217;ve been. With that, we were directed to our tables for the meal to begin.<br />
The rules came out almost immediately. Like with most of the other weddings I&#8217;d been to in recent years, clinking of glasses was poo-poo&#8217;d. Instead, each table was given an envelope. In the envelope was a question about Pam or Sean, that had to be answered by the table. The table then had to present the answers (up to five options) to either Pam or Sean (whomever the question wasn&#8217;t about) to guess correctly. If they were stumped, they had to kiss. Otherwise, the table had to kiss. There were two wildcards.<br />
As consolation for being the last table, we got the wildcard for Pam. Cathy and I immediately dived into a wealth of childhood trivia that we could use to stump Sean. The problem was that we had too much stuff, most of which was vague even for us. Everyone else at the table (who knew Pam, anyway) plugged away at the question, desperate to not have to kiss amongst ourselves. We finally came across one&#8230;<br />
The story went like this: Many years ago, Pam had gone travelling in Europe. She had misjudged her budgetary needs, and ended up having to call home for help. What country was she in when this happened? The answers we gave were England, Germany, France, Italy, and the kicker: It never happened. Now I had to check with Darren because I wanted to make sure that we had the right country. Problem? Well, it was option #5 &#8212; it never happened. Leave it to my family to embellish. This is why we put on the fifth option. As it turns out, this stumped Sean, too. We were quite happy to have found a good one.<br />
Dinner was wonderful &#8212; filet mignon or chicken, depending on which you wanted. (I have to say that the chicken was really tasty, although I had gone for the beef.) A cream of asparagus soup started us off, followed by a salad that I can&#8217;t quite describe. Dessert was a deadly-rich slice of chocolate cake&#8230;<br />
&#8230;along with some entertainment. Sean wasn&#8217;t about to make it through this reception alive, not if his family had anything to say about it. Which, of coure, they did. So they launched into a skit, putting Sean on a mock trial, where his family (led by his father as judge) set about to embarrass Sean, and flog him senseless with pool toys. A little jerky at times, it had the desired effect, and proved that in fact, the Tisdales weren&#8217;t the weirdest family in attendance.<br />
Pam and Sean&#8217;s friends then conducted the Albertan equivalent to the Newfie induction ceremony. (To become an honourary Newfoundlander, you have to drink a shot of screech and kiss a cod.) To be an Albertan, it seems, you have to down a bloody caesar (celery was apparently optional), wear a red clown nose and proclaim that &#8220;I vote PC&#8221;, whack a rubber rat with a baseball bat while chanting &#8220;rat-free province&#8221;, and kiss a pack of raw beef (covered in cellophane, of course). I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten past the caesar (I hate tomato juice).<br />
Dancing began shortly thereafter. Alex had asked if I would dance with her this time (having completely stood her up at Jon and Pearl&#8217;s wedding &#8212; see [[Jon and Pearl&#8217;s Wedding]]), and was determined to do so. Sadly, the one song that I thought would be good &#8212; &#8220;What a Wonderful World&#8221;, by Louis Armstrong. Sadly, Alex wasn&#8217;t in the room at the time. So I requested something more appropriate (so I thought): &#8220;Lost Together&#8221; by Blue Rodeo.<br />
Due to song planning, &#8220;Lost Together&#8221; came up at a non-dancing time (namely, the cake-cutting). It also didn&#8217;t help that Alex wouldn&#8217;t have danced to it, anyway. That left me feeling quite hollow, having finally worked up the gumption to do something about it. I hate, loathe, and despite dancing, and have done so since I was a kid. I have no idea why. So needless to say, it takes quite a lot of effort to ask someone to dance.<br />
We ended up leaving early, before almost everyone else in my family, at 23:45. (The party went on until almost 3:00.) I felt bad for leaving early. This is my family. Leaving so soon just seemed &#8230; wrong. But I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly great &#8212; the whole dancing issue had hit me harder than I thought (the only song we&#8217;d danced to was &#8220;Home for a Rest&#8221;, and it far from compensated). Going to bed, I honestly wondered what others would think. I worried what they&#8217;d say. Something didn&#8217;t seem right. But I didn&#8217;t want to mention it &#8212; just in case I was imagining things.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple of weeks ago, we received a note in our inboxes that Thelton McMillan, the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) had left Critical Mass. Needless to say, this had come as a bit of a shock to the staff, who had not expected something like this to happen.<br />
The reasons for the departure were a bit nebulous, since we weren&#8217;t entirely sure what was truth and what was made up to soften the blow. The official story was that Thelton had done what he was hired to do (restructure Critical Mass into a professionally-managed organization; we were previously more fly by the seat of our pants), and had run out of challenges. Not able to extend himself further, he felt it was time to move on.<br />
To a large extend, Thelton will be missed. Good leadership is hard to find, and that he was, despite his initial introduction to Critical Mass.<br />
When I returned to Critical Mass after my stint with the CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train (see [[Home for a rest]]), Thelton had come on to replace Di during her maternity leave. The Friday of that week, I got my first formal introduction &#8230; when he went on a massive rant about Critical Mass&#8217;s value system, respect, and responsibilities.<br />
He almost instigated a mass exodus. In the span of a few minutes, Thelton pretty much managed to piss of the department with the worst morale in the company. He never apologized for what he said, nor should he have. There was a new wind blowing at Critical Mass, and we were just figuring out what it was.<br />
Over the course of a few months, Thelton turned that relationship around. It took a lot of trust (and to be sure, there were those who never did fully trust him), but the results that came around as a result of his initiatives were undeniable. Politics within the departments aside, the transition went pretty well. (As some of you know, I had pretty major issues with how the transition went within Technology.)<br />
So tonight, many of us came out to bid Thelton a proper farewell. (Especially those of us who have benefitted greatly at his generousity when buying rounds of drinks at various Critical Mass events.)<br />
Departing from Critical Mass shortly after 17:00, Scott and I drove down to 15th Ave. and 5th St. SW, about a block from Bungalow (the lounge formally known as Pongo, since redesigned and reopened), which was our destination. There, we found John, one of our DBAs, trying to find the bar.<br />
Only a handful of people had arrived. The group had doubled 20 minutes later, and double again 20 minutes after that. Thelton and Christy arrived about 15 minutes after we did. Scott had to leave about 18:00; I had to leave before 18:30. It could have easily ended up being a major bender (had I not had existing plans, no doubt I would have hung around to the bitter end). Instead, I had a chat with Thelton and Garth, getting a feel for Thelton&#8217;s plans.<br />
I bid adieu to Thelton as I headed out to my car. I don&#8217;t know when our paths will cross again. I only hope that they will.<br />
Picking up Alex from home, we headed out to Banff (Bamf!). The entire Tisdale clan (extended or otherwise) along with friends were gathering. Tomorrow is Pam&#8217;s wedding.<br />
The drive out was filled with conversation, but after a long day, I was happy to get there and get ourselves squared away. Too bad that ended up being more difficult than it should have been.<br />
It appears the staff at the Banff Park Lodge are a little on the dense side. Aunt Brenda had booked four rooms: one for Brenda, Mike, and Jen; one for Cathy and Craig; one for Mom and Nana; and one for Alex and myself. We were the last to arrive, but there were no rooms left under Brenda&#8217;s name. Two were gone, and the remaining two had been switched to Cathy and Mom.<br />
I piled back into the car to run out and find Cathy and Craig at the St. James Gate, an Irish pub about two blocks away, where everyone was meeting starting at 20:00. We had passed C&amp;C on the way over, so I knew they&#8217;d be there.<br />
Alex&#8217;s introduction to C&amp;C was on the sidewalk outside the pub in the cold weather. Not exactly an ideal situation, but you can&#8217;t always control everything. Cathy was certain that we were in room 105.<br />
The four of us returned to the hotel, Cathy going to retrieve Aunt Brenda. As the story boiled out, Uncle Mike (who had arrived earlier) checked in at the front desk, and was assigned to #105, despite his wife being in #104. He&#8217;d even dumped his things in the room.<br />
Keys in hand, bags in room, car parked underground, and introductions more or less complete, Cathy, Craig, Alex, Mom, Brenda, and I all headed over to the pub. The room in the back was already fairly full, but we managed to squish into a table.<br />
We had a couple of drinks, chatted a while (Mom and Brenda left after about a half an hour), until just after 22:00, when Alex and I decided to head off in the direction of the Hot Springs. (There was another minor reason that was the initiator, but it&#8217;s not particularly relevant.) Jen came with us. It was raining a bit as we drove up, chatting with one another. I dropped Jen and Alex off at the building and went to park the car. They were waiting for me when we arrived. Despite Jen being a couple inches taller than me, she still qualifies as a child.<br />
I was the first out of the change room. The pool was empty. For a moment, I thought it might be closed. But it turns out, on what seems to be an uber-rare event, there was no-one else in the pool. The springs didn&#8217;t close until 23:00, and it being only about 22:25 or so, the pool was all mine.<br />
Well, for about two minutes, which is when Alex joined me, followed a couple minutes later by Jen. For about 10 minutes, the pool was all ours. We were then joined by a pair of women, who stayed primarily at the cooler end of the pool. We went from the hotter section to laying in the &#8220;children&#8217;s&#8221; area and back. I finally bailed about 23:50, when nausea began to set in. Top sign you&#8217;ve been in too long&#8230;<br />
The evening was much more comfortable with the benefits that come from relaxing in that pool. I almost wish I lived in Banff so I could buy and annual pass, and go to the pool whenever I liked. Such as it is, I can&#8217;t.<br />
Maybe this means I need a hottub&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, my family arrived in Calgary. It&#8217;s time for another family wedding (no, not mine), which means the relatives from far-flung reaches of the universe come together.<br />
Pam&#8217;s getting married on Saturday. She and Sean (aka Muck) have been together for about five years (since before I moved to Calgary, anyway), and finally decided to get engaged in late January. On Saturday, this all comes to fruition, and Darren and I get off the hook with Nana for a while longer. (Potentially longer still, if Cathy manages to get pregnant any time soon.)<br />
Cathy, Craig, and Mom arrived on an Air Canada flight earlier today, picked up at the airport by Aunt Brenda. From there, they spent part of the day resting, and the rest shopping. (Cathy, it seems, was on a mission and dragged Mom all over Market Mall in search of jeans.) Craig slept off and on in the car. He&#8217;s a napper.<br />
I had yoga (this being a Tuesday), so I wasn&#8217;t able to bolt over right after work. I had hoped to bring Alex with me and get her introduced to Cathy and Craig a little earlier (rather than Friday, which I fully expect to be a bit of a shock), but she had a meditation class tonight.<br />
Despite a nasty traffic situation (namely, slow drivers in the northeast), I arrived just after 19:00, just in time for dinner. Ham and scalloped potatoes. Jen was absent, being engaged in a volleyball game. Apparently, yoga combined with a harried drive out to Whitehorn put me in a slightly hyper mood (probably also combined with seeing my family for the first time in eight months). Cathy thought I was a tad strung out.<br />
Dinner barely finished, Uncle David and Aunt Alaine appeared at the front door. They were running solo from Darren and Ginny, and Pam and Sean (undoubtedly up to their arse in getting things ready for Saturday). This was ideal timing for the group of us to move into the living room and chat for a while. It was probably our last chance to chat as a loose family until after the wedding. I suspect Uncle Dave and Aunt Alaine will be more than a little busy for the near future.<br />
At about 21:30, Cathy, Craig, and I packed up to go to my place. They&#8217;re staying with me tonight before they go off to Jasper tomorrow. The squeeze into my car was a little tight, but we got everything in. Once at my place, we piled their things into the house, cracked open the case of Moosehead that Craig had brought along, and started chatting. Basic topics were houses, Christmas, Alex, things to see and do in Jasper, and the highways from here to there.<br />
It&#8217;s late, and I need my beauty sleep. Tomorrow will be another long day.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If I had a list of top ten bands that would never play Calgary, KMFDM would have been on list.<br />
But more on that in a minute or two.<br />
Today began fairly normally for a Sunday: Alex and I rose, ate, showered, and prepared for the various tasks of the day. Then we went to church.<br />
Yes, church. Specifically, the Knox Presbyterian just off 33rd Avenue. Naturally, you&#8217;re asking why we went. I mean, this is *me* after all. Church-going isn&#8217;t exactly my thing. In fact, until today, the only reasons I&#8217;d been to a church, aside from tourism, was for weddings, funerals, and one Easter mass when I was a kid. Aside from that, I&#8217;m more likely to sleep in on a Sunday morning.<br />
We went for two reasons. First, it was Thanksgiving, which (admittedly), was more of excuse to go than a reason. Alex wanted to go, having not been for quite some time. This was her first chance to bring me. It&#8217;s signficant because this church was where Alex&#8217;s father used to be a minister from 1978 to 1988. Many of the congregation still know Alex, even though she hasn&#8217;t really been there very much.<br />
The church is a modern design, due to a fire that destroyed the previous building when Alex was a child. The new one is an average size, holding about 250 parishoners (a bit of a guess). The main hall is contained in a 70 to 90 degree arc, with the altar, choir space, and organ at the apex. The outer curve opens into the atrium through two doors (there is no central aisle, which Alex thought was a poor design &#8212; no central way to walk down the aisle for weddings).<br />
The new minister, a man named Murdo, is quite a pleasant person. I met him just before going in for the service, having spotted Alex and I in the Nantex (the atrium space). He wore white robes with a brightly coloured stoal, representing the Christian Creation myth.<br />
The service was nothing particularly fancy, going fairly quickly (about an hour). There were four hymns (none of which I sang, as I can&#8217;t remember how to read music; and my voice is listed as a weapon of mass destruction), a couple of passages from the Bible, a few songs from the band (which many of the longer standing congregation seem to barely tolerate through gritted teeth), and a simple skit that Rev. Murdo guided many of the younger people through.<br />
The parable was one about how 10 lepers (or to be more PC, people afflicted with a skin disease) asked Jesus for mercy, which was how they begged in the time. Jesus instead told them to go see the priests (which, in lieu of doctors, declared whether or not someone was fit to rejoin society). All were cured, but only one &#8212; a Samaritan &#8212; returned to Jesus to give thanks.<br />
That was the Reverend&#8217;s point &#8212; that we don&#8217;t really give thanks enough. Some of us certainly not to each other, but most of us not to Jesus and God. (This is why, of course, that many say Grace at dinner.) This brought a group confessional asking for forgiveness for not giving thanks.<br />
The formality of such a thing was a little awkward. Such are the joys of being an Christian agnostic. I suppose it would have been much worse had I been in a Roman Catholic mass.<br />
The service over, we stuck around for a bit so Alex could talk to some of the people she knows (and to listen to an upcoming child prodigy, who could play one of Mozart&#8217;s more complicated piano pieces having only played a couple of months; Alex loves Mozart). Having met up with just about everyone we needed to, we headed off in search of lunch.<br />
So am I going to make a regular habit of attending services? Not likely. I&#8217;ve never been much for organized religion. I&#8217;m more of a tourist.<br />
We didn&#8217;t end up eating until we got back to Alex&#8217;s condo, but we did stop at Wal-mart to pick up yarn and a couple of patterns. (Yes, Alex has taught me to knit. Now I just need practice.)<br />
Being Thanksgiving, we were invited to Mike and Brenda&#8217;s for dinner. We came armed with dessert &#8212; a four-layer pumpkin cake that Alex and I had made the night before. (Well, Alex made most of it, I contributed by cutting the cake layers and toasting the pecans.)<br />
Dinner was the usual turkey (not that I would ever complain about having turkey), mashed potatoes, creamed onions (a Tisdale favourite), stuffing (of course), and steamed vegetables. Under a small ocean of gravy, naturally.<br />
The cake pretty much all went down, save for one piece. (Nine people, ten slices.) Alex and I declared that the recipe is a success, but needs modification.<br />
We left not long after 20:00, mostly due to Alex&#8217;s allergies (Maggie and Alex don&#8217;t really get along, and Alex forgot her inhaler). This worked out well for me, since I had a concert to attend.<br />
Yes, you knew I was getting to this eventually.<br />
Dropping Alex off at her place, I stopped off at home only long enough to change (crappier pants and a black t-shirt) before heading over to the warehouse. It was about eight degrees, which I felt warm enough to go without a jacket. (Mind you, I drove to the adjacent block, rather than walk the whole way.)<br />
The line was &#8230; interesting. There were two lines, one which seemed to have a lot of goths (wannabe and actual), and the line filled with fans old and new. It was interesting, since I was half-expecting to be one of an extremely small number of &#8220;preppily&#8221; dressed folk. But it seemed I wasn&#8217;t alone, and several others, much more snappily-attired.<br />
I should probably describe why I was wondering about attire. KMFDM is not a mainstream band. They&#8217;re a little more fringe (though not too far from mainstream), which naturally means that those who dwell more on the fringe are likely to come out. Hence, more leather, dark clothing, large boots, piercings of all varieties (and visibilities), and various states of mental abilities (some, sadly, lacking much more than others).<br />
It took nearly 45 minutes to get in the door. The staff at the Warehouse are notoriously slow. Tamara, Todd, and Andrea arrived at 19:30 to avoid the line. When I finally got in, it only took about five minutes to find them. The Warehouse is small &#8212; only about 100 feet by 30 feet &#8212; so there&#8217;s not a lot of room to hide in.<br />
That space filled to the point of illegality. If the Calgary Fire Department had shown up, no doubt they would have shut everthing down for having violated the maximum allowable number of people.<br />
The opening act for KMFDM was DJ Acucrack, a duo from Chicago. Two guys, two Apple PowerBooks, and a mess of samples. The bass was enough to vibrate the hair on my arms. The treble was nigh-deafening (I knew almost immediately that I had made a fatal mistake not having brought ear plugs). But the beat was excellent. They played three sets (or songs, if you like) over the course of about 45 minutes to an hour.<br />
We had about another 45 minute wait until KMFDM came on. Which was a blessing, since the sounds coming out of the speaker system during the wait were slightly more than irritating. Almost as irritating as the idiots who felt it necessary to force their way through the crowd without asking for people to move a little. They knocked Tamara almost completely over once.<br />
KMFDM entered the stage without any fanfare or lead-in. There were five: two guitarists (who played pretty much the same chords for the hour and a half set), a drummer (with about 18 cymbals), Sascha Konietzko (the lead singer; En Esch doesn&#8217;t seem to be with the band anymore), and Lucia Cifarelli (backing and quasi-lead singer). They began almost immediately into a tune I didn&#8217;t know.<br />
Officially, KMFDM seems to stand for &#8220;Kein Mitleid fÃ«r die Mehrheit&#8221;, which translates to &#8220;no pity for the majority&#8221;. (Due to the fact that they&#8217;re German, there has been confusion in the past about what KMFDM actually means, leading to a rumour that it stands for &#8220;Kill MotherF*cking Depeche Mode&#8221;.) Their lyrics typically discuss the rejection of and resistance against incompetent rule in capitalist society, and are often laced with self-deprecation (one of their songs, &#8220;Sucks&#8221;, features the lyrics: &#8220;Our music is sampled / Totally fake / It&#8217;s made by machines / &#8216;cuz they don&#8217;t make mistakes&#8221;).<br />
They didn&#8217;t engage in banter with the audience, pausing only to take quick drinks of water before diving into the next song. Of the entire set, I only recognized a few songs: &#8220;A Drug Against War&#8221; and &#8220;Light&#8221;. Otherwise, most of it was newer than when I&#8217;d last listened to KMFDM. They were good, but after 90 minutes, my hearing was shot (I&#8217;m officially too old to go to these sorts of concerts in tiny venues without earplugs), and was happy to leave. It was worth my time, and is now something I won&#8217;t feel the need to relive again.<br />
Quite a spectrum for a single day, eh?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About five years ago (see [[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Geoff Sowrey]]), I sent out a survey that I got from a friend of mine. The results of that survey were not only enlightening, but also quite humourous in many cases.<br />
Inspired by a quiz I got from Alex, I thought I&#8217;d do the same thing again, but this time, include a lot of other people that hadn&#8217;t been on the list the first time around. The idea, of course, is to see how the responses might change.<br />
The quiz, incidentally, is about me. The idea is to see how much people know about me, and also what they think of me. (The about portion is rather revealing, since all of that information is now on my website.) The rest of it is interesting from a certain perspective. Interviewees include close friends, old friends, new friends, family, and co-workers. The hope is to get a broad spectrum.<br />
Is this egotistical and self-centered? Of course it is &#8212; if you think for a second that it&#8217;s not, you&#8217;ve got a much higher opinion of me! I don&#8217;t engage in this sort of thing very often, but I couldn&#8217;t resist. That said, though, I think I&#8217;m going to leave this as the last survey I do. For now, anyway.<br />
Some of you are a little *too* honest.<br />
So I started off the quiz with the following quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I woke up in a soho doorway<br />
A policeman knew my name<br />
He said &#8216;you can go sleep at home tonight<br />
If you can get up and walk away&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>A few people got this. In my last survey (see [[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Geoff Sowrey]]), I&#8217;d quoted Sting&#8217;s &#8220;Nothing About Me&#8221;. This time, I tried to stay in the same vein of questioning someone. I think the quote I chose was a little too vague, though, as I was trying to keep it a little more difficult. It&#8217;s &#8220;Who Are You?&#8221;, by The Who. The song is also the theme for &#8220;CSI: Crime Scene Investigation&#8221;.<br />
And onto the questions! (Anything appearing in <em>[]</em> brackets are my comments.)</p>
<ol>
<li>My name?</li>
<p>Okay, if you don&#8217;t know who the hell I am by now, something&#8217;s wrong. The correct answer, of course, is &#8220;Geoff Sowrey&#8221;. Some of you, for whatever reason, put only &#8220;Geoff&#8221;. On Jeopardy, Alex Trebek would be giving you trouble for not being specific enough. (Well, that, and not supplying your response in the form of a question.) A few others even put my full name: &#8220;Geoffrey Benton Sowrey&#8221;, something I only ever heard when I was about to get in a lot of trouble from my parents.<br />
Some of the other answers included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Son of Worf (it&#8217;s true you know) <em>[Not according to my birth certificate]</em></li>
<li>Geoff Sowrey..Esquire <em>[Ain&#8217;t got the fancy watch, and I don&#8217;t look like <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0096928/combined">Alex Winter</a>]</em></li>
<li>Geoff Sowrey (not Jeff Sowery) <em>[Damn straight!]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Where did we meet?</li>
<p>No correct answer for this, obviously. I met a lot of people in a lot of places. Most of you were in university or Critical Mass.</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical Mass</li>
<li>Scott Elliott&#8217;s dorm room University of Waterloo</li>
<li>South A, University of Waterloo</li>
<li>Sometime during Frosh Week</li>
<li>At the old Critical Mass office.</li>
<li>On a road in the middle of summer before the last year of high school</li>
<li>Criticalmass..6th floor</li>
<li>Sometime during Frosh Week &#8211; can&#8217;t remember, I was drunk, everything was a blur for a few years</li>
<li>Mr. Getzinger&#8217;s math class</li>
<li>The dungeon of Critical Mass</li>
<li>University of Waterloo</li>
<li>2076 Gatestone <em>[This was the family home I grew up in]</em></li>
<li>U of W, Village 2, Frosh Week, Sept &#8217;91</li>
<li>Math class. Grade 10</li>
<li>SES San Jose <em>[Search Engine Strategies conference in San Jose]</em></li>
<li>Officially? Probably at some CM drinking event <em>[Sad, but likely true]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Take a stab at my middle name&#8230;</li>
<ul>
<li>no idea</li>
<li>Benton ( I cheated, I&#8217;ve been to your website) <em>[A lot of people could have aced this quiz by going to my website.]</em></li>
<li>Not a clue</li>
<li>Tiberius or Luc?</li>
<li>Bob</li>
<li>Clive?</li>
<li>Tiberius 🙂 maybe Norman? <em>[I&#8217;m sensing a Star Trek theme here&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>Oh crap&#8230;I know this one I really do&#8230;unfortunately my mind fails me at the moment.</li>
<li>Robert 😉 (I have no real clue, so that was really just a stab.)</li>
<li>Andrew</li>
<li>can&#8217;t recall if I ever knew it but  &#8211; Robert</li>
<li>Benton (I think&#8230;) <em>[This from a guy I&#8217;ve known for 17 years&#8230;]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>How long have you known me?</li>
<p>I threw in a long list of people who know me for various lengths of time. Why? Because people change over time, and it helps to have people who&#8217;ve seen me at different periods over that time.</p>
<ul>
<li>few months <em>[about two, actually]</em></li>
<li>A little over three years</li>
<li>About 15,329 freezees ago&#8230; <em>[I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ever going to live this damn freezee thing down.]</em></li>
<li>about 4 years</li>
<li>About 17-18 years</li>
<li>13 years and change (holy crap!)</li>
<li>Far far far too long (15 years)</li>
<li>I would say a little over 4 years now.</li>
<li>Since July of 2000, so that&#8217;s makes it 4 glorious years now 🙂</li>
<li>Since 1991 &#8211; so that would make it 13 years almost exactly.</li>
<li>I think it was English 251A. Which was winter semester of my second year. So January 1994. I guess that means a little more than 10 years, but on and off.</li>
<li>Well, Sept 91 to Sept 04 &#8211;&gt; 13 years?</li>
<li>3+ years</li>
<li>Since grade 10. I prefer not to think about the time.</li>
<li>about 5 years</li>
<li>2 years, more or less</li>
<li>30+ years</li>
<li>Long enough to be around when you didn&#8217;t drink. :))</li>
</ul>
<li>How well do you know me?</li>
<p>How well can you really know anyone? It&#8217;s a loaded question. There&#8217;s no way to know someone so well that you can predict them 100% of the time. (There are those who claim they can do that of me, but I&#8217;ve got more than enough examples to bring that down to, say, 98%&#8230;)</p>
<ul>
<li>Probably fairly well I think</li>
<li>Well, thirteen years ago I though I knew you pretty well, and I&#8217;m betting you haven&#8217;t changed that much&#8230;</li>
<li>well, from your online journal I&#8217;ll occasionally peek at.</li>
<li>I would say pretty well&#8230; but I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of things I would be surprised about.</li>
<li>Only familiar with about the first 3 layers..</li>
<li>Fairly well, however, I&#8217;ve wanted to know you way better for a long  time now&#8230;&#8230; but I digress</li>
<li>Well, I think.</li>
<li>Sorry to say, not very well anymore&#8230;</li>
<li>Better then most not as well as all&#8230;for God&#8217;s sake I can&#8217;t even remember your middle name at the moment.</li>
<li>Honestly, not very well. We see each other once in a blue moon and email infrequently. I like what I know though.</li>
<li>Not sure <em>[Yeah, not a good sign, as this is my sister&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>So-so&#8230; we did room together for about a year though.</li>
<li>pretty well considering we&#8217;ve lived together for over 2 years <em>[my roommate]</em></li>
<li>too well</li>
<li>not as well as I used to</li>
<li>I&#8217;d say pretty damn well.</li>
<li>Far far far too well. <em>[I should note that this particular person has a PhD in Psychology&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>Man, I don&#8217;t know if I ever knew you &#8212; hell, I don&#8217;t think you know who you are&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<li>Do I smoke?</li>
<p>Not on your freaking life. Those of you who know me well know that I&#8217;m violently opposed to it. Thoughts of detonating every cigarette manufacturing plant and burning all the tobacco fields in one fell swoop help me out on those days when I&#8217;m feeling really low.<br />
It seems that in most cases, that view has come across pretty well.</p>
<ul>
<li>HA HA HA&#8230;that&#8217;s a good one&#8230;.</li>
<li>Hell no</li>
<li>Absolutely not</li>
<li>No</li>
<li>Not when I knew you, and I seriously doubt that you&#8217;ve started in the meantime</li>
<li>Nope</li>
<li>Not a chance</li>
<li>I think NOT. But am not 100% certain what bad habbits (sic) you may or may not have picked up.</li>
<li>God no.</li>
<li>Nope, only when thinking.</li>
<li>Only the good stuff I hope, but otherwise no.</li>
<li>Only when lit on fire&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<li>Do I believe in God?</li>
<p>Another loaded question, and a touchy one at that. Last time, I was a little hesitant to say whether I did or did not. Perhaps it is time for the official word.<br />
There are a lot of religions and faiths in the world, centering on deities and figures of all kinds. With so many different views in the world, and the fact that I&#8217;ve been (thankfully) exposed to several of them, it&#8217;s awfully hard to point at one specific deity and say: &#8220;That one is the right one&#8221;. Wars have started over that, as we all know.<br />
Obviously, the god in question here is the Christian God. There is significant amount of evidence of God&#8217;s work, at least as told by the Bible. (Naturally, the same can apply to the work of multiple other gods and omnipotent beings.) Direct proof of God, such as Him appearing on street corner, hasn&#8217;t really happened since Moses had a chat with a burning bush (in private, I might add), so some of this might be purely hearsay. So while I might have trouble in the existence of God, I certainly believe in the idea. And aren&#8217;t ideas often the most key thing?<br />
To put it all in perspective, though, I keep an open mind. There&#8217;s a lot of belief in the world, and it&#8217;s all different for a reason. It&#8217;s entirely possible that none of it is right. But if any of it gives people a sense of meaning, then it can&#8217;t be all wrong.<br />
Of course, none of this stopped any of you from trying to guess:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uhhhh, I dunno.  I think so, but perhaps not in organized religion.</li>
<li>Which one?</li>
<li>That depends on whether The Force could be described as God.</li>
<li>I *think* you&#8217;re a believer..but agnostic..</li>
<li>Nope</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t think so</li>
<li>I&#8217;d guess that you believe at least in principle, you certainly have an uncanny ability to make yourself look like Jesus Christ, but you&#8217;re not a churchgoer or anything.</li>
<li>I think so, but not sure&#8230;</li>
<li>Not so much.</li>
<li>Isn&#8217;t that between you and God? Or not.</li>
<li>Some form of deity I think.</li>
<li>I think so, but aren&#8217;t a devote follower.</li>
<li>dunno</li>
<li>not as far as I know</li>
<li>I think so.</li>
<li>Kahless is a god right? <em>[Kahless was the first Warrior King of the Klingon Empire and legendary mytho-historical Klingon figure. Yeah, it&#8217;s a Star Trek thing.]</em></li>
<p>Perhaps the best answer I&#8217;ve received, though not this time around, says it best:</p>
<li>Someone has to be responsible for creating you.</li>
</ul>
<li>What was your first impression when you first saw me?</li>
<p>First impressions are everything. Some of them are good, some of them are &#8230; different.</p>
<ul>
<li>Geek</li>
<li>Hyper, funny and a little bit on the qwerky(sic) side.</li>
<li>Cool, at least I&#8217;m sharing my room with another computer geek &#8230; wait, is that a 386? NOOOOOOOOOOO! He has a better PC than me!</li>
<li>I though (sic) you were a little intense&#8230;</li>
<li>John Ritter-esque</li>
<li>you made such an impression i don&#8217;t remember haaha <em>[That was at the Kelowna party (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]] &#8212; just about everyone was drunk]</em></li>
<li>Who is this star trek geek?</li>
<li>Um&#8230;too long ago to remember</li>
<li>He&#8217;s cute</li>
<li>A little nerdy but really nice.</li>
<li>Finally, a cure for Dave&#8230;</li>
<li>Too long ago to remember.</li>
<li>Freak!</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t remember, before 10 <em>[Uh, minor thought &#8212; you were a BABY at the time, sis! Even my memory ain&#8217;t *that* good.]</em></li>
<li>complicated individual <em>[This person interviewed me for my job at Critical Mass, so that&#8217;s saying something. Not sure what, though.]</em></li>
<li>Oh man, since I was probably drunk, I don&#8217;t really remember.</li>
<li>&#8220;Caffeine..this guy has ingested a lot of caffeine&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<li>My age?</li>
<p>Officially, I&#8217;m currently 32 years, two months, and 14 days. If you look at it from my behavioural aspect, I&#8217;m 18 years old, with 14 years experience. But for laughs, here are some of the other ages some of you thought I might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>33 I think</li>
<li>31</li>
<li>About 21,654 freezees&#8230;<em>[Again with the freezee thing! Let it go, already!]</em></li>
<li>You were born on July 16, 1972, so you are 32, which means next year you will be as they say here &#8220;Christ&#8217;s age&#8221; &#8230; the age he was when he died. <em>[Yeah, if this ain&#8217;t a foreboding sign, I dunno what is.]</em></li>
<li>33? Age is just a number, what really matter&#8217;s is how old you are at heart.</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s see&#8230;just a wild guess but&#8230;.32??? <em>[For the record, this guy has the EXACT same birthday as me.]</em></li>
<li>31 or 32&#8230;I know you just had bday in July.</li>
<li>I am 30, which probably makes you 31 or 32. My powers of deduction say 32. <em>[Good deduction!]</em></li>
<li>30&#8217;s?</li>
</ul>
<li>Birthday?</li>
<p>Although I tend to post this on my website every year (or so), I in no way expect *anyone* to remember it. (Heck, I even forgot my birthday one year.) I&#8217;m lousy at remembering some birthdays, so don&#8217;t worry at all if you can&#8217;t remember what it is.</p>
<ul>
<li>July 16 <em>[Obviously, the correct answer.]</em></li>
<li>Some time in the summer. I could look it up, but I&#8217;m too lazy right now.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m sure you have one &#8211; most humans do</li>
<li>June</li>
<li>early fall?  is it today?</li>
<li>No idea&#8230; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve been invite out for your b-day and now that I think about it, I&#8217;m a little hurt.</li>
<li>July 16th or 17th.</li>
<li>hhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeelp! Do you know mine? <em>[Uh&#8230; nope.]</em></li>
<li>Late summer, early fall.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t know &#8211; I am sorry. As soon as Stefan gets me a new palm I will document all these details!</li>
<li>omg i always forget july 16th? <em>[&#8220;OMG&#8221;, in case you&#8217;re wondering, means &#8220;Oh My God&#8221;]</em></li>
<li>February?</li>
<li>can&#8217;t recall</li>
<li>Another stab in the dark&#8230;July 16th????? <em>[See note about same birthday above.]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Colour hair?</li>
<p>Just so you know, naturally, it is brown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dirty Blondish <em>[Haven&#8217;t had any blonde on my head since I was a kid.]</em></li>
<li>Brown, but it&#8217;s thinning. <em>[Yeah, great, thanks &#8230; I appreciate that &#8230;]</em></li>
<li>Dull brown <em>[I&#8217;ve since changed my conditioner, so hopefully not so dull anymore]</em></li>
<li>Dark blonde</li>
<li>Probably at least once a month (Grecian Formula), what&#8217;s left of it anyway <em>[Yeah, thanks, great. I don&#8217;t dye my hair, as much you want to believe that I do.]</em></li>
<li>Brown.  Definitely brown.  Ish. <em>[Definitely-ish? Is that like &#8220;sort of exactly&#8221;?]</em></li>
<li>Brown</li>
<li>brown like <em>[As opposed to &#8220;exactly brown&#8221;?]</em></li>
<li>Light brown</li>
<li>chipmunk brown <em>[Is that Alvin, Simon, or Theodore?]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Colour eyes?</li>
<p>A bit of a tougher one. A previous girlfriend once told me that they changed from blue to green to grey on any given day. I suspect that it might be lighting. I think they&#8217;re normally blue, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Blue-ish Grey</li>
<li>Bluish I think</li>
<li>I certainly hope not.</li>
<li>Guessing &#8212; green-grey?</li>
<li>Fuck. Um. Brown?</li>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Brown</li>
<li>I think blue or greenish</li>
<li>Hazel</li>
<li>I want to say brown or hazel, but am not sure.</li>
<li>hm good question. brown?</li>
<li>blue-ish grey I think</li>
<li>Blue/green?</li>
<li>umm &#8211; Brown</li>
<li>muskrat brown <em>[Muskrat?!]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Tall / average / short / fat / average / thin?</li>
<p>Height: 5&#8242; 10.5&#8243;. Weight: About 180 lbs (up from about 172 earlier this summer, due to a heavier workout at the gym). Need to lose a little more blubber in a couple places, but I&#8217;d say &#8220;average&#8221; all-round.</p>
<ul>
<li>average. average (was on the verge of more than average there for a while) <em>[Ain&#8217;t that the sad truth? Having your metabolism slow down really sucks.]</em></li>
<li>On the shorter side, average build.</li>
<li>Thin&#8230; But there&#8217;s still plenty of time.</li>
<li>Average-to-tall.  Hell, you&#8217;re all short to me 🙂</li>
<li>That depends on the decade. Mostly average average</li>
<li>Thin</li>
<li>Average Height, Average body type.</li>
<li>Average</li>
<li>Average height, and lookin&#8217; smokin&#8217;!</li>
<li>Average height&#8230;around 6 feetish, come on&#8230;you&#8217;re all buff now from the gym! YAY!!!</li>
<li>I think average height and average weight, maybe a tad on the thin side the last I saw you. But that was about 4 years ago!</li>
<li>Shorter than me and thinner that me.  But average, I guess.</li>
<li>never one to judge</li>
<li>you were average build when I last saw you</li>
<li>no longer fat..thanks to..you know who. <em>[This is the guy who kicked my arse for over a year in the gym. Thanks, dude!]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Do I have any siblings?</li>
<p>One biological sibling, Cathy (my sister). She&#8217;s now married, so I do have a marital sibling, Craig (brother-in-law).</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes</li>
<li>One sister and one brother in law</li>
<li>Younger sister, Cathy.</li>
<li>Yes. Your sister.</li>
<li>1 sister</li>
<li>You have a sister, who&#8217;s an accountant or something along those lines.</li>
<li>Yes, Cathy</li>
<li>Uh huh a sister.</li>
<li>I believe a sister. ::looks sheepish::</li>
<li>Yes. Sister. Cathy</li>
<li>sister?</li>
<li>Sure do, best sister in the whole wide world <em>[Can&#8217;t argue with that &#8230; if I do, she&#8217;ll kill me]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>(If opposite sex) Have you ever had a crush on me?</li>
<p><em>[I screwed this question up. There was supposed to be a second part that reads: </em>(If same sex) Have you ever been jealous of me? <em>Oh well, such is what happens when you don&#8217;t proof-read.]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No. <em>[Don&#8217;t get much more blunt than that, does it?]</em></li>
<li>No, but I do think you are cute!</li>
<li>Definately &#8230;. wink wink</li>
<li>Sorry, I can&#8217;t say I have. <em>[Thankfully &#8230; that was a straight guy.]</em></li>
<li>I feel left out. Why Geoffy, why? Do you not care about me anymore???</li>
<li>No comment</li>
<li>Nope. But I like you anyway. ::smiles winningly::</li>
<p><!--li&gt;Abso-fuckin-lutely&lt;/li--></p>
<li>you&#8217;re a very fetching man. <em>[Says another happily committed straight guy.]</em></li>
<li>Dear god no.</li>
<li>I never crush and tell</li>
<li>N/A, but if I did have a crush on a boy&#8230; Nah. It&#8217;d never happen.</li>
<li>If I oppose sex? Oh, Opposite&#8230; never mind.</li>
</ul>
<li>Whats one of my favorite thing to do?</li>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I really have a favourite thing. Most of you seem think it&#8217;s trains (just because I talk about them a little too much, I guess). A lot of you hit on writing, which ain&#8217;t far from accurate, I&#8217;d have to say. Surprisingly enough, none of you mentioned Alex&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Send really long messages too all the people that have ever lived in your area code &#8212; we love you anyway 🙂</li>
<li>Go to movies</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Watch Movies, chase trains, eat sushi, hang with friends.</li>
<li>Trains, Trains and more Trains oh yeah and you&#8217;re male so masterbate (sic)&#8230;.. <em>[Old university roommate. Suddenly, I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t live with him anymore.]</em></li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Watch movies, and chase trains</li>
<li>Talk incessantly about steam locomotives <em>[Am I really that bad? Wait, don&#8217;t answer that.]</em></li>
<li>watch movies <em>[Could have said trains, but he didn&#8217;t!]</em></li>
<li>Sit in the dark before bed, and meditate to music. <em>[I used to do this in first year at university.]</em></li>
<li>Watch movies, travel, play with trains. <em>[Hard to play with the life-size versions, and I haven&#8217;t had a trainset for years.]</em></li>
<li>I know you love driving your mini. I would bet reading is pretty high on the list. And I know smart-ass comments are up there too. <em>[Insert smart-ass comment here.]</em></li>
<li>Watch movies and listen to music. And blogging.</li>
<li>anything with trains</li>
<li>Chase trains across the prairies. <em>[Actually, I prefer the mountains.]</em></li>
<li>write in your journal?</li>
<li>Follow trains, drink beer, eat sushi, watch movies. <em>[That almost sums it up pretty well, actually.]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Do you remember one of the first things I said to you?</li>
<p>Ask the same question of me, and in many cases, I&#8217;ll probably give you a blank stare.</p>
<ul>
<li>No&#8230;</li>
<li>Nope.</li>
<li>Hi! I&#8217;m Geoff! <em>[Hey, I never said I was an original thinker.]</em></li>
<li>I am not sure what you said, but you were laughing.</li>
<li>a joke about being a selfish american? <em>[Am I really that uncouth?]</em></li>
<li>No, again before 10 <em>[It was probably &#8220;Keep outta my stuff!&#8221;]</em></li>
<li>I am in the neutral zone!!!! <em>[Also long after I met this person, conveniently also one of the instigators of the penny fight]</em></li>
<li>Prolly &#8220;so tell me about dynablow er&#8230;. dynamo shit?&#8221; <em>[Techie stuff. Don&#8217;t ask.]</em></li>
<li>Probably had to do with star trek <em>[Probably not, actually, the whole Trek thing really didn&#8217;t kick in until a few years later]</em></li>
<li>Something about a party</li>
<li>&#8220;Can I grab you some breakfast?&#8221; Said to me while I was sitting at my desk with a severly (sic) sprained ankle.</li>
<li>ummmm. Uh. Nope. It was all in class in the beginning and I am still trying to block out that particular class!</li>
<li>Penny Fight&#8230; Or was that Angry Romanian, Angry Romanian&#8230; <em>[I was the *victim* of the penny fight, and it was *Mad* Romanian. Both events were well after I met him.]</em></li>
<li>Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudddddddeeeee</li>
<li>&#8220;I LOVE FUCKING CHEESESTICKS!&#8221; <em>[See [[Critical Mass Town Hall]] ]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>What&#8217;s my favorite type of music?</li>
<p>If you&#8217;ve seen my CD collection, you know I don&#8217;t have one. I go through phases, though. I have no idea what my current phase is, however. I think I&#8217;m still in my jazz mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rock</li>
<li>Rock, I suppose.</li>
<li>Sting, Kim Mitchell, Anything Chris likes. <em>[Not entirely true. Kim Mitchell gets lumped in with rock, and Chris likes some stuff that I don&#8217;t (and vice versa).]</em></li>
<li>The sound of dropped frozen Kit-Kat bars on our kitchen floor. Or was it Rock? It&#8217;s been a while &#8212; you might be into Britney Spears nowadays&#8230; Oops I did it again&#8230;</li>
<li>Not sure, your tastes vary as much as mine.</li>
<li>hmmmm&#8230;.. Pink Floyd <em>[I do like them, but Mike was the one who *really* liked them.]</em></li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have one favorite type of music. <em>[The correct answer.]</em></li>
<li>Hmm good question..I know nothing about my own musical tastes so attempting to identify yours is virtually impossible for me.</li>
<li>&#8230;. oh boy. ::starts drowning::</li>
<li>Not sure, but you wake up to The Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; <em>[Got tired of that. Now it&#8217;s Jack FM.]</em></li>
<li>Don&#8217;t have a *favourite* <em>[Cathy should know &#8230; she&#8217;s got quite a few of my CDs]</em></li>
<li>Just about anything on CD. <em>[Don&#8217;t forget the 8 track!]</em></li>
<li>i think you like everything except country <em>[I used to hate country, but I&#8217;m finding the new stuff ain&#8217;t so bad &#8230; must be from living in Alberta]</em></li>
<li>tough one..very eclectic tastes..i would say..new age jazz..</li>
<li>dunno</li>
<li>I think you were fairly diverse in this area</li>
<li>Hmm. Not sure.</li>
<li>whatever genre David Bowie is this week. <em>[Ha ha ha&#8230;]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>What is my best feature?</li>
<ul>
<li>Eyes&#8230; something else, but too embarrassed to say</li>
<li>your laugh <em>[Some people might debate this one, calling my most irritating]</em></li>
<li>Smile</li>
<li>The Observer&#8217;s Log.  🙂  <em>[*Sniff* &#8230; thanks, man!]</em></li>
<li>Computer knowledge</li>
<li>Loyalty. I guess.</li>
<li>Your passion for things.</li>
<li>Your ass&#8230;.. hahahahaha <em>[For the record, this is one of my aforementioned university roommates.]</em></li>
<li>Your sense of humor&#8230;.or is it your loyalty&#8230;.pick one.</li>
<li>A great heart.</li>
<li>Humour. Definitely your humour.</li>
<li>Computer smarts.</li>
<li>your personality</li>
<li>loyalty <em>[No-one&#8217;s ever mentioned loyalty before, and it&#8217;s shown up three times. Being part dog probably helps.]</em></li>
<li>Your ass&#8230;.. I have to agree with Brian on this one.</li>
<li>loyalty</li>
<li>sarcastic humor</li>
<li>Odd sense of humor and strangely innappropriate (sic) wisdom. <em>[I asked about this one. Apparently, it&#8217;s about having wisdom beyond my years.]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Am I shy or outgoing?</li>
<p>I used to be shy. Painfully so. I used to totally overcompensate and come across as a raging freak of nature. Only though coaching from my friends Chris, Stuart, and Therese did things slowly turn around. That&#8217;s not to say that I&#8217;m completely outgoing now. Probably more in the middle than anything else.<br />
Of course, the level of outgoing tends to vary depending on level of alcohol consumed.</p>
<ul>
<li>You pretend to be outgoing. But you&#8217;re really shy. <em>[Painfully so&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>I would actually say that you are shy but have a strong physical presence, is that contradictory?</li>
<li>You work really hard at being outgoing</li>
<li>Always seemed outgoing to me. But often that is a cover for shyness. <em>[Isn&#8217;t it always that case?]</em></li>
<li>More on the shy side, I think.</li>
<li>Both.</li>
<li>Outgoing</li>
<li>I would say a little more on the outgoing side.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d say a bit gregarious.</li>
<li>An odd combination of both, but it works</li>
<li>More outgoing &#8211; depends on the situation</li>
<li>OUTgoing</li>
<li>Pretty outgoing. <em>[Thankfully, not ugly outgoing. That would be awkward.]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Would you say I am funny?</li>
<p>At least I&#8217;m not a boring ol&#8217; fuddy-duddy. (Yet. I&#8217;m planning on being a curmudgeon when I&#8217;m old.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Smelling, yes! At least you were way back when. But then again I think all four of us had bathing issues. Except for Roger&#8230; When Sandra would show up. He smelled as fresh as a daisy&#8230; <em>[Old university roommate. Perhaps a little overtold.]</em></li>
<li>Absolutely</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>When you relax and don&#8217;t try too hard.</li>
<li>Often.</li>
<li>very funny..sometimes not on purpose</li>
<li>I would say you are loud  hahahaha</li>
<li>Sometimes</li>
<li>Son of Worf.  Need I say more? <em>[Apparently. &#8216;Cuz that ain&#8217;t funny &#8220;ha ha&#8221;, more funny &#8220;strange&#8221;. &#8216;Course, that might be what you had in mind&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>Yes, very.</li>
<li>Definitely!!!</li>
<li>Can be</li>
<li>sometimes</li>
<li>But of course</li>
<li>Does funny-looking count?  You&#8217;re not laugh out-loud, tell a million jokes, but you definitely have a sense of humour. <em>[I only wish I had the story list this guy has, or the ability to tell them as well.]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Am I a rebel or do I follow all the rules?</li>
<p>*Sigh*<br />
I guess I want to be a rebel, for the romance of the idea alone. But as EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU pointed out, I&#8217;m a rule-follower. I guess I like order, I like the way things are supposed to work, and get annoyed when they don&#8217;t. So much for allusions&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>You drive 99 when the limit is 100. Duh&#8211; rule follower. <em>[Yeah&#8230; you should see me drive out here. I think I only do under 100 on city streets.]</em></li>
<li>I think you are a strong rule follower.  You may try to be subversive in small ways.</li>
<li>Rules all the way.</li>
<li>A little of both.  (Safe answer, huh?)</li>
<li>Follow the rules</li>
<li>rules</li>
<li>Mostly follow the rules but sometimes they need to be broken.</li>
<li>I think you normally follow the rules.  You&#8217;re level headed.</li>
<li>you&#8217;re a rules guy</li>
<li>audio: &#8220;look Geoff a cop!&#8221;; Video: car slows down to 10 below the limit. <em>[*Sigh* Old perceptions that I doubt I will ever out-live&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>Both.</li>
<li>Mostly a play by the rules, though if we get some drinks in you it&#8217;s a whole other story.</li>
<li>Okay, this question is NOT fair. I knew you most at university. I would have said rebel then.</li>
<li>You follow the rules, but complain about the stupid ones. <em>[And by God, complain I do!]</em></li>
<li>Rules, hall monitor, if you will&#8230; <em>[And this is from a person who&#8217;s known me for only two months!]</em></li>
<li>you&#8217;re a healthy mix</li>
<li>You follow your own rules, whether or not they conform to the &#8216;establishment&#8217;. <em>[Oh, this one I like!]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Any special talents?</li>
<ul>
<li>You have a beautiful eye for detail, both in your writing and pictures.</li>
<li>You could remove Dave from your room single-handedly. Really appreciated that in you. You could also recite all the Star Trek spaceships in alphabetical order. <em>[Actually, I never could. And I&#8217;m very happy to have moved beyond that point of my life.]</em></li>
<li>You can make your eyes quiver (ick).</li>
<li>Dickensian style writing.</li>
<li>Bet you laugh the ladies into bed? <em>[Uh, no&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>An inane memory for movies and music triva. You also like to write, and are a photo dude. <em>[Sadly, my music trivia blows when compared to some of my other friends.]</em></li>
<li>penny throwing&#8230;</li>
<li>You take some amazing pictures.</li>
<li>not unless you do that thing with your elbow &#8211; lol &#8211; disregard that one</li>
<li>you know trains like no other person  i&#8217;ve met</li>
<li>Well&#8230; none that I&#8217;ve experienced first hand&#8230; again, I digress</li>
<li>Define &#8220;talent&#8221; heheheheheh.</li>
<li>A talent to pick up conversation with a person and not be awkward even after months or years of not having communications.</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>you have mad jeopardy skillz (sic), if only you&#8217;d use them for good!</li>
<li>that weird eye shaking thing</li>
<li>You mean apart from the Christ thing?  How about the lack of nerve endings on the top of your skull, does that count?</li>
</ul>
<li>Would you consider me a friend?</li>
<p>I&#8217;ll assume that those of you who didn&#8217;t reply don&#8217;t think of me as a friend. (Just kidding!!)</p>
<ul>
<li>I hope so. I just spent the last 10 minutes of my life coming up with ridiculous answers for you &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t do that just for any tom, dick or harry (who are those three guys anyway?)&#8230;</li>
<li>God no. (just kidding)</li>
<li>Of course I do</li>
<li>I would.</li>
<li>Absolutely.</li>
<li>A distant one, yes.</li>
<li>Yup</li>
<li>My Canuck friend</li>
<li>always</li>
<li>Is that supposed to be a joke? <em>[We&#8217;re so close, we&#8217;re basically the same person in two different bodies.]</em></li>
<li>Definitely!!!</li>
<li>Yes. But because of your spirit, not because we have spent loads of time together or have a great big history together.</li>
<li>hell ya!</li>
<li>Of course you moron. <em>[*Sniff* Only a true friend would say that to me&#8230;]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Would you call me preppy, slutty, a homie, average, sporty, punk, hippie, glam, nerdy, snobby, or something else?</li>
<p>Now this is a marked change from the last time I ran this survey. Means I must be doing something right! Now I just gotta figure out what the heck that is&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Definitely a slut&#8230;HAHHAHAHA, I&#8217;d say friendly, with a touch of nerdyness thrown in for good measure.</li>
<li>Honey, for the right amount of money, I&#8217;d call you anything you want 😉</li>
<li>You are you.  You are unique.</li>
<li>Outdoorsy, almost yuppish</li>
<li>Yup</li>
<li>i don&#8217;t believe in labels</li>
<li>None of the above. Maybe a hint nerdy/geeky (but then there are not any of my friends who don&#8217;t claim that), funny, intelligent, witty. aring. Passionate about what you believe in (I am thinking of the two of us email bombarding Kim with reasons to ditch a guy).</li>
<li>I&#8217;m all of the above, so I won&#8217;t hold it against you.</li>
<li>Glam. Totally glam. or maybe you&#8217;re getting to be average. We&#8217;re all very proud. <em>[Huh? What? Me? Okay, people, you need to tell me these things! Remember, I&#8217;m not fashion-savvy.]</em></li>
<li>I would call you Geoff. A little geeky, but then aren&#8217;t we all. <em>[Not quite. I&#8217;m sure there are a few who&#8217;ll see this who&#8217;ll disagree.]</em></li>
<li>something else</li>
<li>Average to prudish. <em>[Prudish? Never been called that before.]</em></li>
<li>geeky</li>
<li>partially reformed computer geek <em>[Well, it&#8217;s a start&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>you&#8217;re a geek like the rest of us poor souls in this industry</li>
<li>Pretty normal. <em>[Thankfully, not ugly normal.]</em></li>
<li>Urban geek. <em>[Woo hoo! You heard it here first, folks!]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>Have you ever seen me cry?</li>
<p>Some of you have, but most of you haven&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t cry very often, and when I do (which is rare), it&#8217;s usually in private. Or a really touching scene in a Julia Roberts movie.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does laughing till you cry count?</li>
<li>I seem to remember that yes, but I can&#8217;t remember when.  Oh well.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t believe I have.</li>
<li>Somehow I think I should answer &#8220;yes&#8221; but I don&#8217;t remember when&#8230;</li>
<li>No. But I have witnessed you upset over email. <em>[Who hasn&#8217;t?]</em></li>
<li>Not in person. Have read about it.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m sure I saw a tear in your eye, when one of us hit you in the family jewels with that stupid foam brick.</li>
</ul>
<li>If there were one good nickname for me, what would it be?</li>
<ul>
<li>MacGyver <em>[This was a nickname I got from coworkers eons ago that my dad latched onto]</em></li>
<li>Runaway Bride&#8230; Sorry mate couldn&#8217;t resist. I mean Big Strong Hairy Hulking&#8230; No, that won&#8217;t work either. You will always be Geoffy to me. G-off does come a close second though.</li>
<li>&#8220;mr. angry&#8221; <em>[Long story.]</em></li>
<li>Dickens. Dick for short. <em>[Uh. Yeah. How should I take that?]</em></li>
<li>Booty-licious ha ha</li>

</ul>
<li>If I were an animal, what kind of animal would I be?</li>
<p>This was a question I threw in, because it offered a lot of possibility for good answers. Thankfully, I wasn&#8217;t let down. But no-one mentioned &#8220;giraffe&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<li>a kangaroo</li>
<li>A Baboon: Wild. Unpredictable. And Loud. Really, really loud. Mind you they are pretty fearless and have one of the strongest social (family) bonds in nature, but in the end, it really all comes down to your ass. 🙂 See Question 19 above 🙂</li>
</ul>
<li>What city (or place) on Earth would be most suitable for me to live in?</li>
<p>Some of you gave me some great ideas, even if I choose to stay in Calgary!</p>
<ul>
<li>After touring most of North America, I actually think that you fit into Calgary beautifully.</li>
<li>Inside a steam train</li>
<li>Calgary.</li>
<li>Somewhere in Japan, lots of Techie gadgets, lots of sushi what more can a guy ask for.</li>
<li>Dunno, wherever the biggest train museum is, I guess. <em>[That would be in Scranton, PA. I guess that means I&#8217;ll have to open one here in Calgary.]</em></li>
<li>Oakville <em>[Written by a guy who lives there]</em></li>
<li>you&#8217;re there</li>
<li>Metropolis&#8230; Oh, you did say Earth. Probably Moscow.</li>
<li>Probably somewhere in Japan.</li>
<li>I think you are likely there now. If it wasn&#8217;t suitable, you would likely leave.</li>
<li>Nowhere but Canuck-land <em>[Never heard of the place &#8212; anyone else know where this is?]</em></li>
<li>Nepal</li>
<li>Japan!!!!  (hint hint) <em>[Three guesses where this guy lives&#8230;]</em></li>
<li>Timbuktu. <em>[Some would argue that I&#8217;m already there.]</em></li>
<li>If we&#8217;re getting along Calgary is good; if I&#8217;m mad at you, Pluto <em>[I love my sister, really I do&#8230;]</em></li>
</ul>
<li>What&#8217;s my favourite word or catch-phrase?</li>
<p>Changes all the time, folks. But glad to see you&#8217;re paying attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>A nervous giggle. High-pitched.</li>
<li>Say cheese?</li>
<li>Neutral zone&#8230; However there&#8217;s a new word that is threatening to beat it: Alex. Alex this, Alex that, Alex here, Alex everywhere. 🙂</li>
<li>De nada. <em>[Spanish for &#8220;you&#8217;re welcome&#8221;]</em></li>
<li>Dude.</li>
<li>F*ck me gently with a chainsaw.  Probably you don&#8217;t use it much anymore&#8230; <em>[This is from a movie called &#8220;<a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0097493/combined">Heathers</a>&#8220;</em></li>
<li>It&#8217;s called shrinkage dammit!!! <em>[Yeah, I don&#8217;t get this one, either.]</em></li>
<li>I think you might say &#8220;brutal&#8221; on occasion, but I might be wrong on that one.</li>
<li>Not sure.</li>
<li>Jesus&#8230;I don&#8217;t have that sort of time&#8230;.</li>
<li>Again with the difficult questions&#8230; 🙁</li>
<li>&#8220;I LOVE FUCKING CHEESESTICKS!&#8221; <em>[Sadly, I never did document this particular evening well enough.]</em></li>
<li>Come on fat boy. I&#8217;ll spork your ass.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t know this, but I do know you emphasize the last words of a sentence emphatically!  😉</li>
<li>Duuuuuuuu[&#8230;]uuuuuuuddddddeeee 🙂</li>
<li>Just one? I don&#8217;t think you have just one.</li>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I went for a walk at lunch today. I do this every so often, sometimes to get some fresh air, sometimes to avoid the sheer insanity of the office, or sometimes to get lunch outside of the Bistro. Today&#8217;s little jaunt took me past Olympic Plaza and Jack Singer Hall.<br />
Now this location is of importance, not because it&#8217;s a nice place to walk, but because of something horrifying that I happened to see as I walked westward.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a murder, though I would almost consider it on the same level of offensiveness. It wasn&#8217;t a massive pile of horse manure, though it stinks just as badly. And to be certain, it wasn&#8217;t a giant pimple, though the sight was just as repulsive.<br />
It was fake fir, copied conifer, fabricated flora, hoaxed herbology, swindled shrub, trick trees. It was in the process of being wrapped around poles, unwrapped from huge roles; it was hung across wires, strung above busy noon buyers. It was spackled with bells and balls; it looked like it was right out of shopping malls!<br />
&#8220;Excuse me&#8230; are these Christmas decorations?&#8221; I asked, nervously.<br />
&#8220;Uh, yeah&#8230;&#8221; said the woman tying off a bunch of evergreen, worried what my reaction might be.<br />
Uh, did we suddenly get stuck in a time warp? Is it already mid-November? Hmm&#8230; let&#8217;s check the calendar, shall we? Oh, look at that. It&#8217;s not even close to December&#8230;<br />
That&#8217;s because IT&#8217;S STILL FREAKING SEPTEMBER! SUMMER&#8217;S NOT EVEN OVER YET!<br />
I really want to know what set off some idiot&#8217;s grand scheme to hang Christmas decorations this early in the year. It&#8217;s bad enough that we haven&#8217;t even seen Thanksgiving or Hallowe&#8217;en yet! It&#8217;s still over a week until the end of *this* month, let alone two more entire months before December.<br />
Now I realize that it&#8217;s entirely possible that said decorations might be for a movie or television shoot. It wouldn&#8217;t be unheard of. But it didn&#8217;t really look like a set of any kind. There were no directors, no assistant directors, no lackeys running about with radios looking like they&#8217;re important when they&#8217;re actually running for coffee &#8230; it looked like the City was actually getting ready for Christmas.<br />
This worries me (if you haven&#8217;t already noticed). How on Earth can we expect to have a decent Christmas if we are bombarded with it for over a quarter of the year? It&#8217;s not special then! It&#8217;s just annoying. It&#8217;s a season onto itself, bereft of any special meaning whatsoever. There are so many people who worry about the lack of spiritualism in our Christian holidays &#8230; gee, I wonder why? They&#8217;ve all be commercialized, marketized, oversized, popularized, televised, aerobicized, and menialized.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
I really hope Christmas hasn&#8217;t come yet. It&#8217;s too warm, it&#8217;s too early, all the leaves are still on the trees. I&#8217;m not ready to see some fat white guy in a bad red suit. I can&#8217;t bear to hear &#8220;The Twelve Days of Christmas&#8221; when I&#8217;m still listening to summer music.<br />
But most of all, I&#8217;ve got no idea what to get Alex for Christmas.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: As it turns out, the decorations were in fact being put up by a filming crew. Hopefully, they won&#8217;t last long.]</em></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> <em>The following entry contains language that might not be appropriate to some. If you are offended easily by some words, I recommend skipping this entry. If you continue to read it, and are offended, your damn funeral!</em><br />
I&#8217;ve listened to George Carlin since I was a beginning teenager. Back then, he was the funniest thing I&#8217;d ever heard. Guess what? He still is.<br />
Tonight, George Carlin came to Calgary, and played the Jack Singer Hall. He certainly has a way of attracting a large crowd. There were exceedingly few empty seats, which just shows his drawing power.<br />
George started out in comedy in the 1950s as a clean cut, well-dressed comedian. He had a show that played well, and was attended by the well to-do of the time. After a while, however, that didn&#8217;t really sit with him. It wasn&#8217;t his thing. He was playing to his parents, not his generation.<br />
This is how he came up with the Seven Words You Can&#8217;t Say On Television: shit, piss, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.<br />
(Offended yet?)<br />
This is what sent George down a significantly different road than most comics at the time. In some ways, he could be thought of as an original &#8220;bad guy&#8221; of comedy. He forever stepped away from the good side, and made sure that the boat would never stop rocking.<br />
George is an observationalist. That&#8217;s what makes him so funny. He doesn&#8217;t invent stories, he doesn&#8217;t create one-liners. He tells you the things you already know, but maybe just haven&#8217;t thought of it that way before.<br />
Take enemas, for example. Not the most pleasant of topics, are they? Well, consider this: you know what they are, you might even know someone who&#8217;s had one. But someone, probably a guy (according to Carlin), thought of it first. Imagine that moment.<br />
George started off his session with a rapid-fire monologue of what he is. I can&#8217;t even begin to describe it, let alone repeat it, and do it any remote point of justice. It was, however, amazing.<br />
He then commented on how he was preparing for his 13th HBO special, and had a few things that he needed to rearrange to make the show be zippy. It was almost like hearing your grandfather (Carlin is 67, by the way) natter away about something very trivial. I was worried. I was thinking that this might end up being a really lousy show&#8230;<br />
&#8220;You know what people don&#8217;t talk about in public anymore? Pussy farts!&#8221;<br />
George Carlin had officially entered the room. So began about a 90 minute barrage of swearing, unusual musings, several slanders against every race, sex, creed, religion, and belief (because, like I said, George loves rocking that boat), with barely a pause. He didn&#8217;t waste time, and despite a couple of low points, he got a lot of laughs.<br />
There were no encores, no curtain calls. He&#8217;s a simple guy who loves to turn the world on its ear for 90 minutes at a time. And that&#8217;s why people love to listen to George Carlin rant. Before there was Dennis Leary, before Eddie Murphy, before Father Guido Sarducci, there was Carlin.<br />
So to you George, thank you. Thank you for coming to Calgary and bringing us a live rendition of your views for us to hear. Thank you for being so blunt about the way things are, good or bad.<br />
And of course, thank you for fucking me up 20 years ago.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I haven&#8217;t been to too many weddings this year. After last year&#8217;s complete lack of nuptuals, I&#8217;m up to my second. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to go any further than a couple of kilometres. After my jaunt to Japan, having to only go a few kilometres was a nice change.<br />
This wedding was for my friends Jon and Pearl. Jon is an ex-Critical Masser, and oft-visitor of the game nights Chris and I used to hold at our place. We haven&#8217;t seen much of Jon since Chris left, but that would be mostly due to not having the gathering we used to.<br />
Needless to say, this was a chance for the lot of us to gather again. It started just before 13:00 this afternoon. Alex and I arrived at the Sheraton Cavalier and found our way over to the McKnight West room, just past the Starbucks.<br />
Isn&#8217;t there always a Starbucks?<br />
Jon was waiting outside the room with his groomsmen and family. He looked nervous. He sounded nervous. He *was* nervous. He uttered to me:<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ever get married!&#8221;<br />
We took a seat on the groom&#8217;s side. Although I knew Pearl just as well, I felt that I needed to sit on Jon&#8217;s side. We were among the first on Jon&#8217;s side to arrive.<br />
By a little after 13:00, both sides had filled in. Virgil and his girlfriend had sat behind us, Doug taking a seat next to them. Fritz and Jin sat behind them. (Sadly, Adrian was a little slow that morning, and missed the wedding. We made sure to give him grief for the transgression.)<br />
The ceremony was a civil one, run by a justice of the peace. I was surprised at the lack of any cultural aspect to the spectacle, since both Jon and Pearl are of Chinese descent. It was simple and brief. It was something that Pearl had been wanting almost since I first met her.<br />
Ceremony over, we went through the receiving line. Pearl&#8217;s parents were nearly ecstatic that people had come to the festivities. Jon&#8217;s parents were decidedly more reserved. Jon was looking a little more relieved, but only a little. Pearl was bubbling, she was so happy.<br />
Virgil and crew were headed over to Joey Tomato&#8217;s to kill a few hours (the reception wasn&#8217;t until 18:00). Alex and I had a few errands to run, so would meet up with the rest later.<br />
Our first stop was at London Drugs. More pictures from our trip to BC (see [[BC Vacation: Calgary to Fairmont Hot Springs]]), plus some wrapping paper and a card. (I hadn&#8217;t a chance to wrap the present yet.) We followed up with lunch at Pizza Hut.<br />
Our errands over, we went over to Aunt Brenda&#8217;s to while away the rest of the time we had. This included wrapping presents and helping Brenda and Mom with their literary works. They&#8217;re going to Pam&#8217;s bridal shower tonight, and need something to go along with the presents. Alex spun the best limerick of the bunch of us. (So yes, there will be yet another wedding before the end of this year.)<br />
We got back to the hotel just before 18:00. Virgil and his date were already there, the others still to follow. Pearl and chanced into a pearlescent (get it?) Chinese-style dress, still as bubbly as several hours earlier. We talked briefly, and chatted amongst ourselves as the guests returned. We were in the same room as before, but with the dividers removed to give us all enough room to sit.<br />
The group of us were at table 14: Fritz, Jin, Doug, Adrian (who we wondered was going to show up on time), Alex, myself, and Virgil and his date (whose name, sadly, I can&#8217;t remember).<br />
Dinner was simple, yet tasty: salad with mango and papaya, steak with vegetables and mashed potatoes, followed with a three-layer chocolate mousse. Lively conversation made for an easy evening.<br />
I schmucked out, though, when it came to the dancing later on. I&#8217;m not a dancer, I never have been. I hate it, I always have. When Van Morrison&#8217;s &#8220;Brown Eyed Girl&#8221; started playing, Alex wanted to go dance. I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it. I just hate dancing that much. I wish I knew why.<br />
So Alex, I know you can&#8217;t fully understand, but you accepted me as it was. I&#8217;m sorry I let you down. It was unfair and selfish of me, and thoroughly heartless. I feel quite bad about it. You are my Brown Eyed Girl, and always will be. I&#8217;ll try my best to make it up to you. I might not be able to dance, but at the very least, I&#8217;ll make an effort to sweep you off your feet.<br />
We left not long afterwards &#8212; many of the guests had already left. Alex and I were the first of our table. Tonight was a reminder of what our group had once been like, long ago. It&#8217;s almost sad that it&#8217;s become like this, but as with all things, change is inevitable.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s something about driving like a maniac that makes for an interesting afternoon.<br />
I&#8217;ve been working on the Mercedes-Benz USA account for over four years now. In all that time, the closest I&#8217;ve ever come to a Benz are the ones I see driving down the street, or the ones we caught in the 2004 Calgary Auto Show.<br />
That is, until today.<br />
Exactly how this was worked out, I&#8217;m not sure, and I&#8217;m not one to pry. All I know is that it was not only well worth my time, but it was a heap of fun. Through an announcement we received from Thelton (likely arranged through Dan, who was on vacation until today), we found that Critical Mass had arranged to attend one of Mercedes-Benz Canada&#8217;s Ride and Drive events. This would give us first-hand exposure to the products we market.<br />
First, though, we had to go through a product seminar. Or at least that&#8217;s what we were told it would be. As it turned out, the presentation had become an episode of &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221;. The team was broken into five teams, each with a speaker. The speaker was to answer the question (or question the answer, in this particular case).<br />
In some cases, the questions were correct, and points awarded. In my team&#8217;s case, represented by Jason, they were not. Christine was kind enough to tally our final score at about -$10,000.<br />
Immediately following the &#8220;seminar&#8221;, we headed to our own personal vehicles (or other&#8217;s if we were getting a lift, which I was), and headed towards the southeast to Race City Speedway.<br />
The event was to start at 14:00, at least according to the website. It was already underway when we arrived around 13:30, although you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of people there.<br />
Race City Speedway is on the bare outskirts of Calgary. It&#8217;s been there for decades, and it shows. It&#8217;s not the most glamourous place: the main parking lot is ratty gravel, the dirt oval looks like it hadn&#8217;t seen a spot of paint in at least 10 years, the timing tower&#8217;s seen a couple of improvements probably in recent times, though iffy, and the bleachers &#8230; well, you won&#8217;t catch me sitting on them any time soon.<br />
That said, the Speedway has a quarter-mile track for drag racing, and a small course for road racing. It was where the quarter mile track starts that Mercedes had set up the entry tent. There we received our tags, denoting us as participants in the event. Exiting the tent, we found the collected inventories of the Hyatt and Lonestar Mercedes-Benz dealerships neatly lined up for viewing. (One of the salesmen would later tell me that Murphy arranged to have their dealerships swamped with customers on the two days the cars weren&#8217;t there).<br />
We were ferried down from the cars to the first of the three event pieces. We were either driven in an ML350 or an S500. I opted for the S500, since I have no interest in the M-Class. The S-Class is a nice line, though I know I have no hope of ever affording one.<br />
The Ride and Drive event is put on by Mercedes-Benz Canada as a sales gimmick. The idea is to go beyond the ordinary test drive, to get a chance to push the car to do the things you wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to do in a normal test drive. The event is actually run by a completely different company, though.<br />
There are three activities at the Ride and Drive: the slalom, the C55 challenge, and braking and handling. This was the order I did them in, too, though I initially had no peticular desire to go near the C55. Details on that in a moment&#8230;<br />
The slalom is a fairly simple thing. The course is a loop, about 250 metres long, and about 15 metres wide. You drive down one side, at a fairly brisk pace, getting to know what the car is like in sharp corners. The course then turns around to return the way you came, with a jog to the left, then back to the right, and a stop sign just before the start/finish line.<br />
Jen, our Product Specialist (she ran the &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; game), and I piled into a C230 Kompressor for the slalom. Jen took the first run, whipping in and out of the pylons that marked the edges of the curves, before whipping around the end, and bursting to the stop sign. We reached the end quite quickly, and we swapped. I don&#8217;t know how fast Jen did the course, but I think I ran it at about 50 km/h. I only hit one pylon. Others in our team were not quite so lucky, both Mabel and Jeff got lectures from the officials about their driving.<br />
I have to say that I have changed my opinion of the C230 Kompressor. I built the microsite for the Mercedes-Benz USA launch a few years ago. I came to loathe and despise the vehicle. I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it. I actually tried to avoid driving it, opting for the C230 Sport Sedan instead. But somehow, it worked out that I got a chance to experience a car that, until today, I hated. Funny how things happen.<br />
As we watched others running the course, Robb finished his run in the C55, proclaiming:<br />
&#8220;You guys have gotta try this!&#8221;<br />
The C55 activity wasn&#8217;t really &#8220;active&#8221;. The C55 is the top of the line in the C-Class line, running about CDN$75,000 base. It&#8217;s an AMG, which is Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s custom sport line. It&#8217;s powerful, about 360 horsepower. It&#8217;s not the sort of thing that Mercedes-Benz is going to willingly let us drive. So they brought in a professional race car driver.<br />
Jen, Marcie, and I donned crash helmets and piled into the C55, Marcie in the front passenger seat, myself behind Marcie, and Jen next to me. The driver smirked through his visor, and the car took off, probably due to the massive ACME rockets strapped to the sides. (Well, okay, it felt like it.)<br />
The course isn&#8217;t long, maybe a kilometre in total length. Of course, pulling corners at 160 kilometres an hour eats up track very quickly. The locks on the seatbelts kicked in almost immediately, and stayed engaged until we got to the end.<br />
The driver didn&#8217;t hit the brake once. Marcie cried: &#8220;Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod&#8221; as we rounded the corners, hanging on to whatever would keep us in our seats. The driver asked if we wanted to slow down. There was a doubly-defiant &#8220;NO!&#8221; from the backseat. Marcie was relieved when the ride was finally over.<br />
The next activity, just down the way from the C55 was hands-on: braking and handling. The task is fairly simple: drive as fast as possible towards a tight, short s-curve to the right, taking the turn while braking. Then come around for a straight-away run back in the direction we came in, running at full speed towards a stop sign, braking to the point where the ABS has to kick in. The idea, of course, is to find out what the cars handle like under the conditions.<br />
We had the choice of a C230 Sports Sedan, the S600, an ML350, and an E500. When I found out that the C230 had a manual transmission, I couldn&#8217;t resist the chance to give it a whirl. Scott (from our Research and Analytics group) hopped in the passenger seat.<br />
The clutch and the shift was a bit &#8220;squishy&#8221; (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that), but I got up to about 100 km/h before reaching the corner. It wasn&#8217;t easy to see (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that, either), and the car handled the braking and turning quite well &#8212; far better than I had expected.<br />
The return run was almost too much fun. Having (more or less) figured out the clutch&#8217;s sweet spot, I accelerated to over 120 km/h before I got to the stop. I popped the gear to neutral, and tried to put the brake through the floorboard. Nary a squeal from the tires, and the car came to a very quick halt.<br />
I would do the run again in an E500, but only as a passenger. It was a noticeable difference, mostly in that the E500 doesn&#8217;t handle as well. It is a bigger engine, but it&#8217;s also a bigger car.<br />
The smell of burning rubber was everywhere. If it wasn&#8217;t us smoking the tires on the slalom course (we regularly did &#8230; though I don&#8217;t believe *I* did), it was us squealing on the braking and handling course. Naturally, the C55 did have a bit of residual afterburn from the hard driving.<br />
We even managed to set off the brake overheat alarm on the E500.<br />
I have to say, I was duly impressed by the Mercedes-Benz lineup that we got to try. I somehow doubt that I&#8217;ll ever own one, mostly because I simply don&#8217;t get paid enough for one. (Besides, I do like my Mini.) What did I get out of all this today, then? A better appreciation for them, which is something you simply can&#8217;t get looking at pictures.<br />
Afterwards, we all headed over to one of the local pubs (Duck and Firkin, Fox and Gherkin, Bob and Merklin &#8230; something like that) for a few rounds. It gave us all a chance to recount our specific tales of automotive achievement, and ridicule each other about the dumb things we did.<br />
&#8216;Cuz hey, if you can&#8217;t mock your co-workers, what other reason do you have for working?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A busy weekend this most certainly was. But it was a fun, productive one.<br />
The first major thing was on Saturday. Mom&#8217;s in town to help out with Nana&#8217;s recovery from surgery (she had her knee replaced at the beginning of the month), so it was only fitting that Mom and Alex finally meet. Unlike my introduction to Alex&#8217;s dad and stepmom (see [[Troubles trying to get home]]), Alex knew about this long in advance, and I prepared her for it. Not that there&#8217;s much to prepare for &#8230; Mom isn&#8217;t an intimidating person.<br />
Cathy and Craig, on the other hand, that&#8217;s going to be an interesting introduction.<br />
The meeting was over lunch, at the Cactus Club Cafe up on Barlow Trail. I hadn&#8217;t been to a Cactus Club since I lived in Vancouver &#8212; so at least four and a half years ago, bordering probably on five. It seems that they&#8217;ve gone a little more upscale than I remembered, coming somewhere in between an upscale casual restaurant and a low-key nightclub. At lunch, it wasn&#8217;t loud or obnoxious, so it was at least pleasant. The decor was pretty chic, too.<br />
Mom had actually dressed for the part, as did Alex. I wore just whatever I felt like &#8212; woefully underdressed again. Mom and I spent most of our time catching up on things. I found out that Cathy and Craig have mostly finished their kitchen, and completed the new bathroom. (Cathy &#8212; care to update me every now and then?) A couple of deaths and a few new shake-ups. Overall, the usual.<br />
Alex and Mom didn&#8217;t talk too much. This was not even remotely surprising. Mom&#8217;s not the in-your-face inquisitive type (that&#8217;s Cathy), and Alex is a little shy. Fortunately, Mom knows a bit about Alex through me; Alex knows a bit of Mom through me. One day, I won&#8217;t have to be the middle man.<br />
Following lunch, I got down to a bit of work, most of which was getting my journals posted from my vacation in BC with Alex. I&#8217;ve got some actual work to do, which I hope to get off my chest before I go to bed tonight. (Alex went to lie down, victim of a nasty headache.)<br />
Tamara&#8217;s birthday is today (happy birthday, Tamara!), and last night was her birthday party, held at Booker&#8217;s Crab Shack. We&#8217;ve been there a couple of times, and it&#8217;s a great place for Louisiana-style food. Alex was to come, but her head just didn&#8217;t let her up. I stopped by briefly before joining Tamara, Dan, and Doug at Bookers. We were later joined by Todd, Andrea, and Cailey. Dinner was a nice fillet of tuna, for me, anyway.<br />
I returned to Alex&#8217;s after dinner, an Orange Crush Froster (Mac&#8217;s version of the Slurpee) in hand. I thought the coolness might help her head a bit. As it stands, she was already feeling better when I arrived, so it became a bit of a bonus. We watched &#8220;True Lies&#8221; on Access before going to bed.<br />
We tried not to sleep in this morning, as the big event of the day was going out to Canmore. Today was the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s production of &#8220;Mozart on the Mountain&#8221;. It&#8217;s a show that features Mozart, held on one of the greens of the Stewart Creek golf course, in the shadow of the Three Sisters. In theory, outdoor concerts shouldn&#8217;t get any better.<br />
To be certain, I&#8217;d have my doubts that it could get worse.<br />
First off, I have to say this much: the concert was excellent. The music was wonderful, the soloists (Nikki Einfeld, soprano; and Paul Grindlay, bass) were excellent (although showtunes from plays and movies don&#8217;t sound as good when sung by opera-trained singers). The weather was even decent (although it did get cooler as the day wore on), despite the garbage we&#8217;ve been having all summer (if you can in fact call it &#8220;summer&#8221;). I was a bit surprised at the lack of Mozart (we had only selections from &#8220;The Magic Flute&#8221; and Symphony #41), though they renditions of &#8220;Colonel Bogey March&#8221; and &#8220;Blue Danube Waltz&#8221; made up for it, in my ears, anyway. The volunteers were also quite nice, those we dealt with anyway.<br />
Now, here&#8217;s where my bitching starts. Just getting tickets was an ordeal. Alex has a huge gripe with this, having wasted over an hour trying to purchase them, and then spending two hours trying to (unsucessfully) pick them up. She even wandered into the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s offices without a single person actually being there. What&#8217;s up with that?<br />
That&#8217;s annoying. What was really frustrating was the organization (or complete lack thereof) at the event site. We were not permitted to drive to the Stewart Creek Golf Course. Why not? Try finding parking for 7,500 patrons in the area. We ended up having to park in fields and empty lots around Canmore, and were bussed to the site. That, at least, was intelligent. The busses came onto the grounds, went into a bus loop (newly-constructed for the event, and didn&#8217;t look big enough), and empty people out to walk up to the green, a distance of about 400-500 metres.<br />
We had to walk through a tent that contained sponsors, vendors, food, and the CPO&#8217;s merchandise store. The ground was soggy from all the rain. We walked on bark mulch, which wasn&#8217;t much better. It took a while before we got to the asphalt trail used for the golf carts. It wasn&#8217;t a hard walk, but it was a slow one &#8212; the trails are narrow, and people weren&#8217;t walking fast.<br />
Finding a seat wasn&#8217;t too hard, but we were quite a ways back. (The concert didn&#8217;t start until 14:00. We arrived at about 12:45. People were apparently lined up for the busses at 8:00 that morning.) The tricky part was finding seating where we weren&#8217;t surrounded by chairs. This annoyed the both of us.<br />
According to the sheets we were given, the ONLY kind of seating that was supposed to be allowed were &#8220;festival chairs&#8221; &#8212; folding chairs with legs less than half the length. This is so people without chairs can still see over and around you. I can count on my fingers and toes the number of actual festival chairs I saw. The rest were the full-sized chairs. There was absolutely no control on them whatsoever.<br />
Just a thought to the event planning team at the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra: the next time you say &#8220;festival seating&#8221;, make sure you either enforce it, or don&#8217;t mention it at all. People will abuse it to no end, and all it does is create friction between patrons. Why? Because, simply put, people are jerks and look out only for themselves. They have no qualms about putting up chairs in front of people who came on blankets (which were allowed, and dare I say encouraged by your instructions). If you do allow full-sized seats, how about designating blanket and festival seating in front of the full chair seating, or put the full chairs off to the sides and allow blankets in the middle?<br />
Luckily, Alex and I managed to keep some space to ourselves.<br />
The concert ran long. Originally supposed to finish at 16:00, it didn&#8217;t end until 16:45, completing with an unscheduled rendition of the Can-Can. Many people kicked up their heels to that &#8212; those who hadn&#8217;t already tried to leave.<br />
This is where it got really ugly.<br />
You can&#8217;t send 7,500 people down the golf cart paths at once. It takes a bit of effort. So the line moved very slowly. Also, you can&#8217;t put 7,500 people onto busses the way the organizers had envisioned. Their idea? Load up 4-5 busses at a time on the bus loop, send them up the hill and off to the parking lots, and bring in 4-5 more busses to be filled. On paper, it seemed like a good idea. Here&#8217;s the problem: on paper, everyone behaves.<br />
Rule #1 in event planning: people will never behave on their own if you don&#8217;t try to control them.<br />
The line moved painfully slow around the vendor tent at the bus loop. When we finally reached the other side, we saw, quite literally, a sea of people. There were no lines, and since all the volunteers were watching the crowd go down up on the paths, there were hardly any down at the loop to control the crowds. So what happened was a mess: people standing where they wanted to, trying to force their way onto the busses as they came by, and getting on where they could. Busses were sometimes half-full (or worse, completely full) starting from the far side of the loop (these selfish folk walked around the crowd, circumventing the honour system completely), preventing people at the front of the line from being able to get on.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t until people started to vocally complain that something was done. By that point, however, control had completely laspsed, and the system was mere moments from breaking down. Busses couldn&#8217;t be filled fast enough, and many had become so impatient that they were virtually standing on the road, blocking the busses. It all came to a head when one of the busses got too close to the inside of the loop, and almost rolled over onto its side. (Luckily, it didn&#8217;t, and no-one was injured.)<br />
Almost immediately, people started walking up the hill in droves. Patience had totally worn out, and we were ready to walk back to the car rather than wait for the busses to finally get their acts sorted out. When Alex and I reached the top of the hill, we found dozens of busses waiting, as if we should have all just come up there in the first place.<br />
I was amazed, even dumbfounded at the sheer idiocy of how poorly this had been handled. Don&#8217;t think you can control 7,500 people trying to get onto busses? Of course you can, but you have to run it like Disneyworld: forcibly put people in lines, and let only so many people through at a time. Let everyone know, right to the back of the line, how long the line is, and how long you&#8217;ll have to wait to get out. When you fill the bus, make people go right to the back and fill to the front. When people sit down at the front, they block everyone&#8217;s ability to get in. Remove constrained loading/unloading areas (like the loop), and go to the road. Load 10 busses at a time, and count off EXACTLY the number of people per bus, so there&#8217;s no question of too many or two few.<br />
It was that level of totalitarianism that was missing.<br />
We didn&#8217;t get on a bus until after 18:15. We didn&#8217;t get back to the car until after 18:30. We didn&#8217;t get home until after 20:00. This from a concert that ended three hours earlier. It&#8217;s an hour drive to Canmore, if you take your time.<br />
A question to the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra: you want to know why you&#8217;re losing patronage? Take a wild guess. I&#8217;ll give you a hint: if you&#8217;re running your business the same way you run that festival, you&#8217;d better start shopping out your resumes.<br />
&#8216;Cuz I ain&#8217;t the only one who noticed the problems today.<br />

The Chateau&#8217;s name is a little misleading. One is brought to think of the Canadian Pacific (now Fairmont) hotels, with the old world grandeur and luxury. Make no mistake, folks, this ain&#8217;t the Banff Springs. It&#8217;s a 1950&#8217;s motor lodge with a fancy roof. But it&#8217;s comfortable, and the grounds a nicely kitchy. Besides, it&#8217;s a family business, and run very well.<br />

		<p>We awoke about an hour earlier than we have in mornings past, but for no real reason. We didn&#8217;t even hear the rooster!<br />
The porridge was followed, almost as soon as we could get ready, by a cat hunt. Allen has plans for his farm, which includes a new barn (of some kind). The problem, of course, is that you can&#8217;t have a barn without having mice and rats &#8212; that&#8217;s just a side effect. They can be controlled, however, with cats.<br />

		<p>That stupid rooster woke us up again. We&#8217;ve taken to mocking it. If it crowed normally, we probably wouldn&#8217;t mind so much. I fell back asleep, though, and Alex went into the house. She came back to wake me up for breakfast.<br />
Fog was hugging the ground all down the river valley. (Not exactly unheard of in the Lower Mainland.) Naturally, this set me off on a photography expedition. You have to move quickly with fog &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t last long once the sun starts coming up. I got some wonderful pictures, especially of a space amongst the trees near the tent.<br />

		<p>There&#8217;s a rooster not far from Allen&#8217;s farm. (Well, &#8220;farm&#8221; is using the term a bit loosely. It was a farm before he bought it, and it will be one again. But it&#8217;s going to take a bit of work.) This rooster isn&#8217;t particularly normal. We&#8217;ve been speculating why it doesn&#8217;t sound normal. Most roosters gain their sound by listening and mimicing the sound of other roosters. This rooster doesn&#8217;t seem to have rooster peers, so it lacks the stereotypical cockle-doodle-doo one would expect at 5:30 in the morning.<br />
This one sounds like a cross between a coyote and a freight locomotive horn.<br />

		<p>Cory had called me yesterday. I didn&#8217;t know until this morning because I hadn&#8217;t checked my cell phone. I&#8217;d had a dream that things had gone horribly awry at the office, and for some reason, that had made me want to check my cell phone. Good or bad, something was up. Sure enough, our newest star hire had backed out &#8212; an extremely disappointing turn of events. I wouldn&#8217;t talk to Cory about it until late in the afternoon.<br />
We were gone before 8:00. (We were to have left at 6:00, then 7:00, but last night&#8217;s arrival in Fairmont pushed us even later.) Allen was in Jean&#8217;s Honda Civic, Alex and I in Alex&#8217;s car. I drove while Alex read &#8220;Why I Hate Canadians&#8221;. Today&#8217;s lesson? Canada&#8217;s cast system, more formally known as how poorly we treat Indians. It&#8217;s a hard thing for a Canadian to admit that we don&#8217;t treat everyone fairly and equally. For a country known as being &#8220;nice&#8221;, we treat our aboriginal peoples very poorly. We&#8217;ve marginalized, forcibly contained, abducted and tried to convert them, even poisoned them with disease. And yet after 400 years, they&#8217;re still who they are.<br />

Allen (Alex&#8217;s father) took Jean (Alex&#8217;s stepmom) down to Cranbrook so she could catch a flight out to southern Ontario for a wedding. This meant the condo was quiet for a number of hours. That meant we didn&#8217;t get up until late. I love sleeping in.<br />

		<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like waking up to the sound of lawnmowers. Rousing, yet entirely annoying.<br />
We started the day off with a mom saver. This is generally a breakfast meal, though I suppose you could just as easily use a version of one for any meal of the day. The breakfast one we had consists of eggs, cubed bread, cream cheese (cubed, or something similar), some spices, and thrown in the oven to cook for 45 minutes. Throw on some maple syrup on top, and it&#8217;s pretty tasty. There&#8217;s also a ham and cheese version that I&#8217;m dying to try some time.<br />

		<p>I so wanted to get my butt out of the office, almost from the moment that I was alerted to the problem on MBUSA.com&#8217;s live server. There&#8217;s nothing like trying to diagnose the cause of a homepage failure when you&#8217;re not really sure what happened.<br />
Most of my day was like this. Going from one hot spot to another, barely getting enough time to wolf down some lunch. By the end of the day, I had to make sure that I wrapped up dialogue on three separate projects, ensure that the process was moving on two more, finish a proposal to Danny Sullivan for presentation topics for the next Search Engine Strategies conference, and write a rather lengthy email to about a dozen people to make sure they have some inkling about what the heck I&#8217;ve been doing for the last couple of weeks.<br />
Care to take bets that things will still go to hell in a handbasket tomorrow?<br />

		<p>It&#8217;s been a while since our last surprise weekend (see [[Surprise Visit to Drumheller]]), but not for a lack of wanting. We&#8217;ve been that busy. Either Alex has had to work (the joys of working in the medical community) or we&#8217;ve both been traveling. This weekend was the first one we&#8217;d had to get away.<br />
It was a bit of a special one, but for no other reason than we&#8217;d barely seen each other in almost three weeks. I was away in San Jose for a conference (see [[Search Engine Strategies Conference 2004 San Jose, Calgary to San Jose]]), followed immediately by the Calgary Dragon Boat Festival (see [[2004 Calgary Dragon Boat Festival]]), and then Alex was off in Ontario for a week and a half. So I had to plan this weekend&#8217;s getaway so we&#8217;d have some time to ourselves.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, My Favourite Giant left Critical Mass. And we are lessened by his departure.<br />
Luke Puxley started at Critical Mass not quite two years ago. He was a daunting figure, mostly due to his sheer size. Luke is not a small man, though he never played the &#8220;big man&#8221; role. He was simply a larger version of EveryMan. He was kind, funny, helpful, thoughtful, intelligent, and hard-working.<br />
And he liked to goof off just as much as the rest of us. Maybe moreso.<br />
Luke was &#8220;My Favourite Giant&#8221; to some of us, &#8220;The Giant&#8221; to others, &#8220;Sir Bonks-A-Lot&#8221; to a precious few, but was as much a Critical Masser as the rest of us. He will be forever immortalized in a sketch prepared for our summer Town Hall (see [[Critical Mass Summer Town Hall and Kananaskis Cowpunch]]), most notably for his portrayal of a hard-working, sweat, big guy. (Come to think of it, some of us are still haunted by those images&#8230;)<br />
So it was simply natural that we have to make a final burst for Luke as he heads his way to an MBA. Yesterday, Mark arranged for a lunch at the Drum and Monkey, which I couldn&#8217;t attend due to an interview I had to conduct. (For the record, I don&#8217;t much like the Drum and Monkey for lunch, anyway. Too much food, and the service is lousy.) We would make a go of the usual run of things: Vicious Circle and sushi afterwards.<br />
Late because of a long-running conference call, I arrived at VC shortly after 17:40. Festivities were already well underway. Although we didn&#8217;t have a massive gathering, there were at least 25 people in attendance. Not shabby for someone who&#8217;d been mired on the Mercedes account for three-quarters of his employ.<br />
Friday afternoon was sunny and warm, and sitting on the patio of VC was something we all could enjoy. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Critical Mass team dominated the east side of the patio. We could have packed in more people, but were snubbed by Steve and Jana, and later by Thelton and Christie (though they had a better excuse &#8212; anniversaries do tend to take precendence).<br />
As afternoon turned into early evening, attendees started to drop off. The call for sushi went out, but acquired only a handful of takers: Scott, Linday, Luke, Reid, and yours truly. When minimal mass (the opposite of critical mass &#8212; when a sufficiently small number requires the dissolution of a particular state) was finally attained, the five of us headed over to the Sumo Lounge in Eau Claire Market (convenient for Luke, Lindsay, and myself, since we all live within walking distance).<br />
We had a booth to ourselves, thankfully away from everyone else. Why thankfully? Because we were loud.<br />
Okay, <em>I</em> was loud.<br />
One litre of sake between the five of us. Luke eventually cut himself off (it was a bit much for him). Peter Kinjo, the owner and Chief Troublemaker, made a point to come around and spread his unique brand of cheer. No dancing for Luke in a rubber wig and kimono, though &#8212; I suspect they wouldn&#8217;t have fit him, anyway.<br />
Departing Sumo, all of us but Reid (he was heading out to join up with Jim) headed upstairs to the Cineplex to play some air hockey. Luke went down in the first round, but it wasn&#8217;t an easy one. (Sake really destroys hand-eye coordination.) He&#8217;d get his revenge later on. We went around to various video games before deciding to give pool a shot. Somehow, we ended up playing darts instead. That took a while, since none of the four of us were any good.<br />
Oh, and that round of bottle caps (drinks, not the candy) didn&#8217;t really help, either.<br />
Scott and I finished a round of pool while waiting for Luke and Linday to finish their darts game. Despite having a near total lack of coordination at this point, I was able to aim surprisingly well. The lack of coordination finally showed through when Luke took me down in a final game of air hockey.<br />
With that, we all headed out into the unusually warm Calgary evening, Luke and Linday heading up to Crescent Heights, Scott and I heading over to my place in Sunnyside. I offered to give Scott a ride home, but needed to sit down a while and rest before getting behind a wheel. (Just because I&#8217;m inebriated doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m irresponsible.)<br />
We watched The Simpsons on DVD before I was inspired to put on The Great Escape. I fell asleep barely into the movie (I was exhausted), waking up about an hour or so in. By this point, it was almost 3:00. I took Scott home, hitting the sack almost as soon as I got back.<br />
The office will certainly be a quieter place without Luke around anymore. But we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see him from time to time.<br />
After all, he&#8217;s gonna miss us at the breakfast table.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, we went for a little paddle. Five hundred metres in about two minutes and five seconds, to be precise.<br />
This weekend was the 13th annual Calgary Dragon Boat Festival, or the Alberta Dragon Boat Racing Festival, depending on who you ask. It&#8217;s the largest in Alberta and attracts teams from as far away as Edmonton and Lethbridge (or so I gather). Most teams seem to be local.<br />
The races take place on the Glenmore Reservoir, the only body of water in Calgary large enough to handle something like this. It&#8217;s big enough for a 500 metre course, with more than enough room to spare for the various sail boats and Heritage Park&#8217;s paddle wheeler, without causing trouble.<br />
Alex and I arrived (still very sleepy) at 7:00 Saturday morning, to try and find the Topmade tent. Easier said than done, since there is almost no decoration at that hour of the morning of the first day. Fortunately, the club had been busy, already having hung the banner and brought in the trailer with the equipment (specifically, paddles and life jackets). There were three tables, some with food, and a huge pile of water bottles (over 2,000 at last estimate) to help us out.<br />
The tents were set up in a block &#8220;U&#8221; shape, with Topmade in the southeast corner. Each tent was about 10 feet by 10 feet square, with a high pointy roof. Some tents were subdivided to handle the size of the teams. Some had only half a tent. There were even rumours of quartered tents.<br />
Topmade had three entire tents.<br />
There are eight teams in Topmade: Dragoneers (the competitive team), Dynasty (the semi-competitive team), DI-Hard Dragons (where I started, a recreational team), Water Dragons (another rec team), Spirit Dragons (rec), Trico Select Dragons (rec), Red Dragons, (men&#8217;s team), and Phoenix (women&#8217;s team). The latter two (men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s) aren&#8217;t dedicated teams, and are comprised of members from the other teams.<br />
By 8:00, we were all assembled and DI-Hard started its warm-up. That was a bit difficult, as the weather outside was not exactly cooperative. It was cold and raining. None of us were particularly happy about that. Warm-up not really having lived up to its name (but our muscles sufficiently loosened), we were called down to the marshalling area to prepare for our first race.<br />
The festival was set up with the tents quite a ways from the docks. Why, I don&#8217;t know. It meant all the teams had to go up and down a set of stairs that was simply not big enough for all the traffic. The marshalling area was at the Calgary Canoe Club&#8217;s docks (which is where we sailed from). In between the tents and the stairs was the stage and beer tent, ideally set up to prevent the easy flow of competitors from their tents to the boats. (Seeing a theme of planning here?)<br />
We arrived at the marshalling area, shivering in the cold, and told to wait in the rain while the opening ceremonies took place. We didn&#8217;t get to really see or hear them (we were just far enough way to miss it), nor did we really care at that moment &#8212; all we knew was that we were cold and wet, and it wasn&#8217;t even 9:00 yet.<br />
Finally, the first batch of racers went out and the festival got underway. We took our place under the marshalling canopy until it was our turn to go out. There were 12 dragon boats, used in rotations of six &#8212; half out on the race, the other half loading for the next one. Ideally, not a problem. However, the weather conspired against us, and it was exceedingly difficult to stage the boats without them drifting in the wind. So the process was a little slow.<br />
When our boat was called, we marched down to the docks and lined ourselves up for our boat. We were up against one of our own in the first race &#8212; Water Dragons (I think), which Arnold (our coach and drummer) also drummed for. For what reason, we&#8217;re not sure, but Arnold left us for the other boat, bringing in Christine from Dynasty to drum in his place. Thankfully, Topmade&#8217;s drummers are all top-notch.<br />
Here&#8217;s the trick to dragon boating: Focus. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all there is. Don&#8217;t listen to anything but your drummer and your steerer. I mean any *thing*. Not the birds, the wind, the PA systems, the crowd, you name it. All you should hear are instructions. That&#8217;s how you get through a race without killing yourself (or the rest of your team) wondering how other teams are doing, etc.<br />
Christine took us down to the staging area, which is two buoys (about 20 metres) behind the start line. It took a while to get the boats sorted out, but we finally got ourselves lined up. Then the six boats slowly started forward. These were rolling starts, meaning you didn&#8217;t totally stop before &#8220;Go!&#8221; was called.<br />
Normally, in race conditions, I get severe nerves. When I was on the swim team back in high school, I used to get so nervous my bladder would shrink to the size of a pea (yes, pun intended) right before a race. That&#8217;s what focus gives you &#8212; no nervousness. You pay attention to the drummer and steerer. You focus on their words, and you can actually forget what else is going on around. It&#8217;s very zen.<br />
From the moment the first start was called until we heard &#8220;let it ride!&#8221;, I can&#8217;t really tell you what happened. We weren&#8217;t perfect, we weren&#8217;t ideal. But we won the race, one of two heats we&#8217;d run on Saturday. (A bit of a misnomer, since the festival organizers later discounted all the first heats for some unknown reason.) Our time? About 2:21.<br />
Bonnie (our steerer) just about broke down when we got back to the docks. The wind and water currents had given her an extremely hard time. Added to the stress of the first race, she wasn&#8217;t exactly in the best of conditions, and understandably so. She, like most of the rest of us, would pile into sleeping bags and blankets to try and warm up when we got back to the tents.<br />
So began the day of keeping an ear out for which team was being marshalled, having to run back to the tents for equipment, running back and forth from the portable toilets, and generally trying to stay warm. Just before lunch, after we&#8217;d all been in the rain and the cold far too much for one day, DI-Hard was called down again. Only to be sent away after a while because the officials were cold.<br />
Apparently, they didn&#8217;t notice the runny noses, blue lips, and shivering bodies of the competitors.<br />
DI-Hard&#8217;s second race was considerably better than our first, coming through with a time of 2:16, knocking five seconds off our previous time. It was good to have Arnold at the drum again. But it wasn&#8217;t good enough to win &#8212; we came second. We were beat out by last year&#8217;s grand champions. We weren&#8217;t too upset about that.<br />
I also race for the Red Dragons, who came up later that afternoon. This was a small race, as there were only four men&#8217;s teams. (By comparison, there were over 12 women&#8217;s teams, three of whom were from the same club.) This was a race I was looking forward to. Arnold guided us through a visualization (as most of the teams did before a race) and a stretch.<br />
We entered the lane, lined up, rolled to a start, and 2:05 later, were flying past the finish line. The next nearest boat was over a boat length behind (so I&#8217;m told).<br />
Races ended for the day with what&#8217;s called the Beer Run. This is when a group of teams (the competitive teams, I think) race for, well, beer. A keg of it, so I&#8217;m told. Dragoneers (who had done exceptionally well all day) didn&#8217;t win, unfortunately.<br />
Alex and I took off for home. That night, we went over to her family&#8217;s friend&#8217;s house, not far from the University. This was the family of her best friend, Rebecca, and where her father and stepmother were staying while in town. It was a chance to meet Rebecca&#8217;s parents (Rebecca is still in Costa Rica) and mutual friends visiting from Rocky Mountain House.<br />
Dinner was awkward, but not because I was the &#8220;new guy&#8221;. It was because of a freakish little event that only seems to happen in movies and coming-of-age TV shows, where the new boy thorough screws up in front of the parents. In my case, it wasn&#8217;t because of anything that I did myself. It was because of the chair I was sitting on.<br />
Now, I&#8217;m not overweight. In fact, I&#8217;m pretty much in line with what I should weigh for my height. But that didn&#8217;t stop the chair under me from creaking, cracking, bending, and finally breaking. It happened over a couple of seconds, so in theory I could have reacted more quickly. But I didn&#8217;t. Before I knew it, I was sitting on the floor, amidst a mass of shattered wood. There was no laughter, just stunned silence.<br />
This definitely ranked high in my list of Uncomfortable Moments.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long, leaving just after 20:00. Alex and I were both exhausted from the day, and Alex wasn&#8217;t feeling very well, either. When we parted ways that night, Alex commented that she might not be able to make it out the next morning.<br />
The phone rang at 6:01. Alex&#8217;s condition hadn&#8217;t improved much. We talked about it for a while and decided that she should stay home at least until she felt well enough to come down. Yes, there is the issue of letting the team down. Somewhere, you have to draw that line. I knew that, somehow, we&#8217;d make it without her, even if just for a while.<br />
Sunday was cold and wet, though it (thankfully) never really rained. Running into Bonnie and Chris upon my arrival, I dropped the bomb that Alex wasn&#8217;t coming. Bonnie immediately freaked &#8212; how do we balance a boat with one less person? We couldn&#8217;t register a new person easily (though it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered &#8212; the officials never checked) and we&#8217;d be out one person&#8217;s weight on one side.<br />
DI-Hard was one of the first teams up again, and we were down at the docks ready to run. It was calm, the wind having died overnight. The reservoir was glass. This was going to be a good race. Arnold lined us up, and we shifted Carrie to the other side to balance things out (how that worked, I&#8217;ll never understand).<br />
Despite all the preparation and focus, the heart just wasn&#8217;t there. We didn&#8217;t paddle well, we didn&#8217;t have the timing, and the results showed it. We were not happy at all with our first race. Arnold tried to bolster our spirits, but it just wasn&#8217;t working.<br />
Good news hit us not long after we got back to the tent &#8212; Alex was going to make it after all. Things had settled and she was ready to roll. She found us down at the docks as we were watching other teams display their muster.<br />
DI-Hard&#8217;s fourth race was the one we were meant to run. It was timed, it was solid. We didn&#8217;t win, but we didn&#8217;t care, either. We knew it was good, and our time showed it &#8212; 2:15. Not much better than the previous day, but Alex wasn&#8217;t the only one feeling a bit down &#8212; Graham was also well under the weather, so probably hadn&#8217;t been able to put in his all (he has the longest reach on the team, and can use it well).<br />
The Men&#8217;s Final came up soon after. Mark and I were already quite high from the DI-Hard&#8217;s run, so were looking forward to this one. The Red Dragons had met before the race, and discussed that we were not only going for the gold, we were going to try and break the two minute mark. It was something we all thought was possible.<br />
I thought Arnold might actually force his larynx out from the way he was yelling. The boat moved in surges like I&#8217;d never felt before. It was so bad that my outside foot slipped three times off the support, causing us to lose time and momentum. It was probably because of me that we didn&#8217;t break the two minute mark.<br />
Towards the finish line, we were all grunting in unison, powering our way through the strokes. All I could hear was the screaming onshore as teams cheered the racers on. When we finished, we all looked at Arnold for the results. All he did was smile and hold up one finger.<br />
The high continued right up until the finals were announced. At that point, the proverbial crap hit the fan.<br />
The festival breaks everyone into divisions: A, B, and C. Generally, the better you are, the higher you rank. Dragoneers are always A. Last year, DI-Hard was the C champion, and we were looking to be the B champion. Imagine our surprise to learn that we were in Division A&#8230;<br />
&#8230;and our total dismay to find out we were in the Consolation race. No medals.<br />
This sparked a huge furor in the team. How the hell could this have happened? What the hell was a &#8220;consolation race&#8221;? Hey, you did well! You did so well that we&#8217;ll let you race again just for the heck of it! To say that we were ticked off is putting it mildly. Even more so when we saw that slower teams had gotten into the medal round of Division A, and faster teams were in the medal round of Division C.<br />
Somehow, we&#8217;d ended up being too good for Division B, but not good enough for Division A.<br />
This is when Arnold straightened us out. According to the system, it&#8217;s luck of the draw. You race who you race against &#8212; there&#8217;s no planning aside from names drawn from a hat. If you win, you get three points; second gets two points; third gets one. Points are tallied and that&#8217;s how you end up in the race you end up in. By that measure, we were the seventh best team out of 45 teams. By last year&#8217;s rankings, we would have been the Division B winners.<br />
No, we weren&#8217;t racing for a medal. We were now racing for ourselves. Screw the official nature of everything, we were out to prove a point: You want to come up with a completely moronic way of organizing a series of races, that&#8217;s your problem. We&#8217;re not about to be shown the door that easily. We were determined to win that race, and post a better time than some of the teams in the Division A finals.<br />
Two teams didn&#8217;t show up for the Division C consolation. Couldn&#8217;t really blame them, either. Spirit Dragons came in second. Dynasty, a better team than DI-Hard, won the Division C finals. No Topmade teams made Division B (go figure), so we cheered on whoever we could.<br />
Division A consolation came up, and we were back in the boat again. Arnold was there, telling us that we had already done better than last year&#8217;s festival, medal or no medal. He looked us square in the eyes and said that he&#8217;d waited for five years to get a first in the Calgary festival, which we did with the men&#8217;s team. It didn&#8217;t matter if there was a medal at the end, it was the progress that mattered. It was how we showed our mettle then that would prove how we would perform in the future.<br />
The team had never been that focused. We ran the best race that DI-Hard probably has ever done. We were barely a second slower than the previous run, but it didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we&#8217;d won. For that, we were happy. All of Topmade (except Arnold and the Dragoneers, already out to their final) waited for us at the top of the dock, to shake our hands. Nah, we didn&#8217;t win a medal. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that really would have made a difference.<br />
The Dragoneers were against the two toughest teams: Crew Yahoo and the Edmonton Dragon Boat Club. (Trico Select was also in the race, but &#8230; well, to put it as succinctly as possible, there were never in it to begin with.) For the first 250 meters, we had no idea where the various boats were (out of the three, anyway). But by the 400 metre mark, the Dragoneers were pulling away. And they poured it on.<br />
I think we all went deaf when they crossed the line first. This was turning into a banner year for Topmade.<br />
The Women&#8217;s final was last, but certainly not least. Sang (DI-Hard&#8217;s captain) and not quite half of the Dragoneers went for the Phoenix boat. They were up against several strong competitors, including the Magic Spindles, who had defeated Phoenix before.<br />
There is a reason the women&#8217;s team is named &#8220;Phoenix&#8221;.<br />
We could hear Arnold at the 250 metre mark. Although he was steering, he was yelling so loudly that it was possible to hear him over the crowd. Spindles were pouring it on, but Phoenix&#8217;s form was almost perfect. They crossed the line to a tremendous cheer. I think Alex had her ears plugged from the cacophony.<br />
Trouble started not long afterwards. One of the boats (originally thought to be Phoenix) protested. Something wasn&#8217;t right. We couldn&#8217;t figure out why the heck we&#8217;d protest our own win. *That* wasn&#8217;t right. As it turned out, it was the Spindles &#8212; they&#8217;d smacked the starting gate on the way out and hadn&#8217;t had the run they wanted. They would have to race again.<br />
Topmade jeered the announcement so loudly that you couldn&#8217;t hear the PA over the club. This was just ridiculous. These people had just poured out everything in a hard race, and because of one steerer&#8217;s mistake, all would suffer? Several of the Phoenix women were downing whole bottles of water &#8212; the ones on the Dragoneers probably felt like giving up, even if just for a moment.<br />
The six teams went back to the start line, over 500 metres away, and prepared for the second race. (Incidentally, dragon boats always move under their own power when loaded with rowers &#8212; they are never towed.) Most of us felt for our poor clubmates &#8212; we knew what it was like to finish a hard race. But to then jump into a second one? That was torture.<br />
The PA system cracked with the radio chatter echoing the instructions from the start line: various boats being jockeyed into position. Hangs were clasped, stomachs tightened, foreheads knotted, and breaths held. Even when the start tone sounded, there wasn&#8217;t much sound from the crowd.<br />
There was no way to tell how the teams were doing. We could almost feel the exhaustion from the team. We all looked expectantly, hopefully, as they all crossed the 250 metre mark, almost dead-tied. The cheers started around the 300 metre mark, and rose steadily as the boats closed in on the finish line. If we could have heard Arnold&#8217;s voice over the din, it would have probably been like listening to a lion&#8217;s roar.<br />
Somehow, all the hopes of every member of Topmade must&#8217;ve made it out to the Phoenix boat. It started to pull ahead, probably as a result of a power 10. From the 400 metre line to the finish, the gap just got larger and larger. On the first run, they had paddled with 154 strokes (yes, someone counted). On the second, 186. Despite the extra run, the extra exertion, and the sheer power required to pull off two wins in a row, the cheer from Phoenix nearly brought tears to the eyes of everyone on shore. It was a well-deserved win.<br />
The Topmade club stood at the top of the dock, welcoming back every single paddler from the final race, handing them bottles of water (we barely made a dent in our supply). The women were happy, but exhausted. Some had to be helped away. Even Phoenix, despite their win, showed their fatigue. Even then, happiness was obvious.<br />
Topmade cheered our victories back at the tent, and took the time for presentations of our own. Arnold, possibly the hardest-working guy in the club, and Nick, who keeps everything working (though no-one really knows how), were given carbon fibre paddles after a collection from the teams. Then all of us posed for pictures.<br />
The awards ceremony took place at the beer tent, after the band finally took a break. It was something else to go up with the men&#8217;s team for our gold medal. There&#8217;s something to be said for having that chunk of metal around your neck that just shows you&#8217;ve done something. Mark and I both lamented that the rest of DI-Hard wouldn&#8217;t get that experience.<br />
After the awards, the festival effectively ended. It was late &#8212; about 19:30, and most of us were tired. The women in the finals had been quite giddy with what was left of their adrenaline, but even they were passing out. It was time to go home.<br />
Despite the complaints about festival organization (poor tent locations, bad timing on the first day, and an utterly ridiculous ranking system), it was a good time. And I look forward to next year.<br />
Especially after I modify my workout routine a bit.<br />
