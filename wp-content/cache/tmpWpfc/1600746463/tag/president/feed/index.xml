										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love American politics. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wwe.com/">my form of WWE</a> &#8212; all the cheers and jeers with all the spectacle to go along with it. One day, I think the American presidency will go the way of the <a href="http://hhgproject.org/entries/president.html">President of the Galaxy</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy"><em>Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</em></a> and be little more than a distraction from the real power.<br />
Heck, it could be like that already, for all we know.<br />
Today, it was announced that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/03/election.democrats/index.html">Hillary Clinton would be willing to consider a Vice-Presidency</a> with Barak Obama as top billing. But here&#8217;s a thought: Are Americans ready for this?<br />
<span id="more-983"></span>Let&#8217;s review the American presidential history, shall we?<br />
43 Presidents. Every single one of them a white male. The closest the United States has ever gotten to breaking that mould was with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Ferraro">Geraldine Ferraro</a> in 1984 &#8212; an election I remember well, notably due to her Presidental candidate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mondale">Robert Mondale</a>. (Refer to a previous post featuring [[The Shrub is back|lack-lustre Democratic nominees]].) It was a risky time to attempt such a running mate. Abortion was a hot topic of the day, and the United States was a lot more conservative back then.<br />
A black man (or African-American male, if you prefer)? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Jackson">Rev. Jesse Jackson</a> tried twice, in 1984 (defeated mostly as a result of himself) and 1988 (defeated by, of all people, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a>). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:African_American_United_States_presidential_candidates">He wasn&#8217;t the first African American to try</a>, but he&#8217;s been the only one until Obama. And by far the most successful. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Powell">Colin Powell</a> declined not to run, though he might have done well.)<br />
But the question remains: Given the history of the last two elections (one being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2000">near-travesty of democracy</a>), will this work? I think that both Obama and Clinton could stand on their own. They&#8217;ve broken through the problem of charisma (they&#8217;ve both got it in spades, which accounts for the delay in getting the nomination pinned down), and could stand well against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_mccain">John McCain</a>.<br />
But together on the same ballot?<br />
It almost seems too liberal to me. Personally, I&#8217;d love to see it, but I have my doubts that even after eight years of Bush&#8217;s rather dubious leadership that they would turn to an idea that radical. (Remember the United States&#8217; tendency for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states">Red vs. Blue states</a>, and a number of states that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6383353/">voted out gay marriage</a> in pure terror of change.)<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m being too cynical. Maybe I&#8217;m not giving enough credit.<br />
I know this much, though: McCain had better watch himself. The mere second he even thinks of using race or sex as part of his stance, he&#8217;ll immediately alienate a huge section of voters. If nothing else, this will be the most politically-correct election you&#8217;ve ever seen. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, yes, everyone&#8217;s heard about <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/">Stephen Colbert</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.stephencolbert08.com/">run for the presidency</a>. Those of you who watch his show regularly (sadly, I do not; though Alex is becoming a massive fan) know what Colbert is like. Perhaps not the most serious &#8212; or informed &#8212; person to be on the ballot.<br />
And let&#8217;s be sure we&#8217;re talking here &#8212; he was aiming to be on the ballot in South Carolina. But <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1573288/20071101/id_0.jhtml">the Democrats down there decided to throw him off</a>.<br />
Big mistake.<br />
<span id="more-855"></span>The Democrats have had some serious issues getting the right people in front of the American public for President. The last two have gone down in infamy, having lost due to a legal decision, and the second time because &#8230; well, we&#8217;re not really sure why. But I&#8217;ve got my own thought on that.<br />
Simply put, they were boring.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore">Al Gore</a> wasn&#8217;t exactly noted for being rambunctious, flamboyant, or extraverted. More alone the lines of &#8220;dull as a rock&#8221;. Smart, yes. Became a <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">wonderful defender of the environment</a>. But that was <em>after</em> losing to someone who shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to run with scissors, let alone a country.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry">John Kerry</a> became famous for changing direction like the wind. That, and he didn&#8217;t seem physically capable of being interesting. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean">Howard Dean</a>, by comparison, was great until he shoved his foot so far in his mouth he could stand on his own colon.<br />
The key here is that boring doesn&#8217;t win. If you think it&#8217;s about putting in the right person, you&#8217;re missing the point. It&#8217;s about who has more charisma. (Throw in whatever conspiracy theory you want, the reality is that government is done largely by committee, no matter country and/or political system.) Subconsciously, everyone wants a President who represents the spirit of the United States. Dubya didn&#8217;t win because he was the right one (he&#8217;s proved that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_to_impeach_George_W._Bush#Rationales_for_impeachment">several times over</a>) &#8212; it&#8217;s because he at least had some form of presence.<br />
I know this because I look at Canadian politics. If we had to elect our own Prime Minister, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_humour">we&#8217;d be screwed</a>. Most of them have no more excitement than a stick. So thankfully, we just vote for the party we think is right. They sort the rest of that crap out for us. Doesn&#8217;t always work, but then we just vote them back out again the next time.<br />
Colbert would have been a great candidate. He would have won the Presidency, too. Tell me that he wouldn&#8217;t have buried every other candidate by throwing them oddball questions that they wouldn&#8217;t know how to answer. No script in the world could account for someone who talks on his feet. Think <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0483726/">Man of the Year</a> is pure fiction? I&#8217;m willing to bet Colbert could have taken South Carolina without trying.<br />
<a href="http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9805080-2.html">A million people already support him.</a>  That&#8217;s grass roots support. Sure, <a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/group/BarackObamaOneMillionStrongforBarack">Obama&#8217;s got that, too</a>, but it took him several times longer to get it.<br />
After eight years of Bush, the world needs someone to laugh at for a while. If nothing else, it would make for the most interesting (if not funny) election ever seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh, I&#8217;m gonna get in some hot water for this one&#8230;<br />
So the other day, I heard a comment that the Loonie was the highest it&#8217;s been since the early 1970s. About the time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Tricky Dicky</a> was in the Oval Office.<br />
That made me wonder a little&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-847"></span>Thanks to the internet, there&#8217;s a lot of information that&#8217;s now readily available. Like historical data on the Canadian dollar vs. the American dollar. And finding dates of offices for seated US Presidents isn&#8217;t exactly something that requires a PhD.<br />
So, using a graph acquired from the <a href="http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/">Pacific Exchange Rate Service</a> and dates from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> itself, I&#8217;ve come up with this:<br />
[photopress:dollar_president.jpg,thumb,pp_image]<br />
So I ask you, because I&#8217;m a little hesitant to read into this too deeply, does having a perceived ill-performing President directly lead to a low US dollar? We all know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Nixon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford">Ford</a> didn&#8217;t really do much, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter">Carter</a> didn&#8217;t rock the boat (he is a peaceful person), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan">Reagan</a> brought about &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics">Reaganomics</a>&#8221; which then led to controversy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush">G. H. W. Bush</a> brought about the first Iraq War, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">Clinton</a>&#8216;s biggest problem was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal">his libido</a>, and I&#8217;m curious to see how history writes up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">Dubya</a>.<br />
Things that make you go &#8220;hmm&#8221;&#8230;</p>
