		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890709.20</strong><br />
<em>Day 10</em><br />
Today, almost everyone (except Jason <!--the Wonder Drunk-->) was in higher spirits. Jason felt as if he were dead and spent the entire day in bed. Lisa and Greg disappeared for the whole day, which left the rest of us in suspense as to what was happening. Unfortunately, nothing &#8220;hot and lusty&#8221;, as Toni would say.This morning, most of us (those who didn&#8217;t sleep in) went to the Botanical Gardens. It was, to say the least, f&#8211;king&#8217; hot!! Then we (Toni, Derek, Pete, Shaun and Myself) went to the beach to swim and catch some rays. I almost caught too many as I now have an acute sunburn. Others (i.e. Jeremy) were not so lucky. Then came lunch and an hour boat ride (which saw Mr. Phillips as the helmsman for most of the trip). Upon returning, most went back to the beach, some crashed. As for me, I forgot what I did.Tonight, there is to be another dance (except this time, Greg wants to crash the Heinekin Bar) but I have chosen not to go as I need a hell of a lot of sleep, something I haven&#8217;t been getting lately.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That morning was one I had wanted to wake up to since the trip started. It was bright and sunny, few clouds in the sky. It was also quite warm, bordering on hot. To put it mildly, a perfect day in the Soviet Union. The day did not start without problems though. My roomie, Jason, was sick. He didn&#8217;t have a cold or anything, he just looked like he was about to do a lot of worshiping at the porcelain altar. I never really found out why he was sick, but we traced it to the glass of wine he had the night before. Either that or something in the water got to him.<br />
I then ventured downstairs alone for breakfast. It seemed however, that I was not alone. Several other people had their roommates abandon them too, if they even came down at all. The breakfast population was quite small to say the very least.<br />
Again, news of that morning&#8217;s tour came up. A trip to the Botanical Gardens didn&#8217;t seem all that exciting, but it was better than doing nothing at all. So as soon as I finished my breakfast, I ran up to my room, grabbed my camera, checked on Jason to see if he wanted to come (he didn&#8217;t even move) and shot back down via the stairs.<br />
Those of us who were awake then piled on a bus and proceeded along the one way road to the Gardens. We didn&#8217;t get onto the highway though, we stopped just short of it. We filed off the bus and walked over to a three story concrete tower. It was a cable car tower. The cable cars were suspended from wires, unlike the ones in San Francisco which run along the ground. The car was fairly large too, we all managed to get on (which shows you both the size of the car and the lack of people who showed up).<br />
The ten minutes ride to the top of the hill was fairly uneventful, besides the initial rocking that was so bad, I though the cable might snap, and the docking at the other end which I thought was going to punch a hole in the side. One thing should be noted, the botanical gardens aren&#8217;t that large, but the cable car was most likely designed by the same engineers who designed the elevators.<br />
The tower at the top was much higher than the lower one, but this also had an observation level on it. That&#8217;s where most of us went. From up there, we got some spectacular shots of the area in which we were staying, even though it was a little too bright. When the time came and we all hustled down to the ground. Mr. Findlay managed to beat us all down. I guess he didn&#8217;t like heights much. My mother didn&#8217;t even like the pictures I took that looked right down the side of the tower. She hates heights.<br />
Walking down the hill was no easy task. The path was on a fairly steep incline and for those of us who didn&#8217;t let gravity jog us down to an area where it leveled out, we had to take our time. It was hard to keep slow. Jeremy was one of those people. He completely disappeared for a couple of minutes, but then his voice (sounding much like Jackie Gleason in the Honeymooners) boomed out from where he had been. He walked towards us claiming that:<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s ferocious! It&#8217;s a man eater! Don&#8217;t get near it! It&#8217;ll peck your eyes out!&#8221;<br />
Peck your eyes out? I had to see this. So did several others. We headed back in the same direction Jeremy had come from but couldn&#8217;t see anything that dangerous. Then, through the trees, we saw Jeremy&#8217;s monster. It was a male peacock. I should have known better, Jeremy was a bit weird. Okay, he was a lot weird!<br />
The Gardens was split up into sections that were made to look like the countries where one could find the plants that grew there. We found the peacock in the Japanese area. A little further down we found the Mexican area. Just before we reached that however, we found a small fountain around which were a couple hundred tourists. That&#8217;s when Derek, Shaun and Greg got it in their heads to act a bit unusual &#8230; they dunked their heads in the fountain. I have never seen so many dirty looks from so many Soviets all at the same time!<br />
Of course, I couldn&#8217;t really blame them, I wish I had done the same. The temperature in the Gardens was almost unbearable. At least the Black Sea kept the beach a little cooler. This was a bit much. Although I didn&#8217;t have a thermometer, I guessed that the temperature was somewhere in the vicinity of 102 degrees &#8230; in the shade (providing that you add on the humidex).<br />
A couple of minutes later, we were at the bottom of the hill. But the tour wasn&#8217;t over yet. We then went through an underpass to another section of the Gardens on the other side of the highway. The first thing we saw was a very thick and very tall growth of bamboo. Someone commented that we were in Vietnam. That was a little dull, but we quickly reached a small building with green windows.<br />
The windows were actually clear, but at a distance, I didn&#8217;t realize that it was a fish tank. The water was a dark green, but it wasn&#8217;t cloudy. You couldn&#8217;t quite see to the other side, but you could pick out most of the fish in the tank. We stayed for about five to ten minutes before our guide said it was time to go. As far as I was concerned, any place cooler was better than that.<br />
When we got to the place our bus was supposed to be waiting for us, it wasn&#8217;t there. While our guide took off to find it, the rest of us looked at the small market that was assembled near by. One of the small tents sold cold drinks. To the average person, it looked like cold Palmolive dish washing soap. A small glass cost 33 kopecks and several of us got a glass. A few even got two. It was very sweet and had an aftertaste reminiscent of dishwater. But when one is hot and thirsty, you don&#8217;t give a damn.<br />
When we got back, we realized that we still had most of the morning to go. Pete, Toni (who had missed the Garden trip), Derek, Shaun and myself decided to make a break for the beach, while it was still a little on the empty side. We ran into Mr. Phillips (by now we called him John, his first name but for respect, I&#8217;ll leave it as Mr. Phillips) and asked him to join us. He accepted and we began the labourious task of finding a place to lie down.<br />
To make lying down on the beach easier, the hotel made up several hundred little wooden beds, which you put on top of the stones (not especially for us, some of the benches looked about ten years old). They were quite comfortable, considerably more than the stones that we would have had to lie down on if we hadn&#8217;t been able to snitch any beds.<br />
But we did snitch enough for our group. The towels went down (the beds were painted and got quite hot, but not as hot as the stones) and the suntan lotion came out. Everyone, except me, coated themselves with it. I can&#8217;t stand the smell, it makes me quite ill &#8230; I put up with the burns (after so many years, it doesn&#8217;t seem to matter much anymore). Of course, we took turns splashing around in the sea to cool off from time to time. We had to take turns, or chances were we would loose our beds, not to mention the stuff we had come down with.<br />
Pretty soon, we had accumulated quite a large number from our group. As some of them were more intent on a dark tan, that meant more of us could splash around in the water longer. This led to something else. Anita had begun not long before to get me a bit worried. Either she was making passes at me (which I seriously doubt) or she was doing what I like to do others from time to time &#8230; making a pain of herself. To put in layman&#8217;s terms, she was following me around a lot and was determined to catch me in the water. This is when my three years on the school swim team and my ability to swim long distances underwater came in handy.<br />
Suzanna came up with a good idea at lunch time how we could spend our afternoon. I didn&#8217;t care what it was, spending all that time of the beach got to me after a while and I would have gone parachuting from the fifteenth floor if it were more interesting. She made mention to a boat about a half a kilometre from our hotel that sail four or five times a day on an hour boat trip. To most of us, it sounded like a good idea.<br />
So following lunch, we grouped in the lobby (after we had made hasty retreats to our rooms and back) and then headed out for the boat. Incidentally, Jason was still in bed, sick. Neither Derek, Pete or myself could get him to budge. When we arrived at the ticket booth, Mr. Phillips informed us that he would be paying for all our tickets. It seemed he had brought too many rubles and was intent on getting rid of a few. What he didn&#8217;t know was that many of us collected the fifty kopeck fees and put them in his camera bag. I wonder if he ever found them?<br />
The boat looked circa World War Two with about a good solid inch of paint on it. In the Black Sea, it bobbed like a cork, but it didn&#8217;t flip over. I quickly glanced at the name, I almost thought it said &#8220;S.S. Minnow&#8221;. I couldn&#8217;t help but mention it to John. Soon, we were underway. Several of the girls had come in their bathing suits and were now tanning themselves in the strong sun. A few others were indulging themselves with a chorus of &#8220;The Ballad of Gilligan&#8217;s Isle&#8221;. KB was of course, filming with that stupid camera of his. I felt a bit like Sean Penn after a while.<br />
True to my promise to Suzanna, I finally nailed her (in film, not Jason&#8217;s way, although I must admit I wouldn&#8217;t have minded). It wasn&#8217;t too hard, I just had to time it when she wasn&#8217;t looking directly at me.<br />
Somewhere about halfway through the ride, I ventured to the leeward side of the boat where it wasn&#8217;t quite so sunny. There I found Suzanna talking to whom I assumed was the captain. Except she was talking in English, and I doubted the captain spoke anything but Russian.<br />
I was right, she was talking to Mr. Phillips. I wondered where he had disappeared to, he was piloting the ship. As first I screamed (which caught his attention) and then I took I picture of him. About ten minutes before we finally returned to the dock, I went to the bow where I found Pete and Derek. It was surprisingly windy up and the front, and a lot cooler. Shortly after me, Toni arrived. The lot of us chatted and I noticed something which Pete told me about just after we got off. Toni was standing next to me, not him.<br />
When we got off, I saw the full implications of Toni and Pete&#8217;s split. When Toni had got on the ship, she still had her bags from the BS shop. She hadn&#8217;t had the time to got back to her room to drop them off. Toni wasn&#8217;t carrying them when we got off. Derek was. Of this, Derek and I have a small dispute )he argues that Toni hadn&#8217;t brought any bags on). But this was engraved in my brain. I tend to remember things like that and if KB had video taped it (I&#8217;m surprised he didn&#8217;t), you would have seen Derek carrying her bags.<br />
Previous experience had taught me that went such a thing happens, relationships become extremely strained and often snapped. I could see the same thing coming with Derek and Pete. I was assured about six months later, that despite events that supported my theory, their friendship had not deteriorated. Of this, I was very much relieved.<br />
Once we got back to the hotel, everyone split up again. Some returned to their spots on the beach while others went to their rooms and crashed out. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s what I did, although I&#8217;m not 100% sure. The only reason I think I took a nap was because I remember being waken by Derek and Toni during their search for Pete.<br />
There was also a bit of controversy that afternoon. It seemed that Greg and Lisa V disappeared, and none of us knew where. Toni speculated something &#8220;Hot and Lusty&#8221;, but much to her dismay, nothing happened at all. At least not with them. There were a few others who avoided the trip on the boat and just laid in the sun. Jeremy fell asleep. When he woke up, his back was practically blistered from the sun. That&#8217;s what I was told. Believe me, if you had felt that sun, you would have believed it too.<br />
Dinner was uneventful, Jason was still sick. By now, just about everyone was aware of it, and everyone kept asking me what was wrong with him. The best I could reply was that he was sick to his stomach and puking every five minutes. So I stretched the truth a bit. Who cared?<br />
No longer feeling tired, I made a trip upstairs to the Observation Level. From here, you could see miles on any night. When no-one else was around, you felt quite peaceful up there by yourself. I could hear the bandshell that was near our hotel and the people in our group way down on the balcony of the Heinekin bar. I could see them, partially hear them. I didn&#8217;t bother to try and get their attention though, they were too far down.<br />
On my way down to sign in for Jason and myself, I ran into Shaun. He was giggling his ass off about something. But instead of telling me, he dragged me back to his room to show me. The inner door, which separated the bathroom from the main room, was closed. I was about to open it when Shaun stopped me. He closed the outer door first and then led me into the room, cautiously. I couldn&#8217;t figure out what all the care was for.<br />
Then I spotted it, standing on the TV. It was a pigeon. Shaun and Jamie had trapped a pigeon in their room. The bird had taken revenge for its entrapment by relieving itself all over everything. The counter, the floor, the TV, they were all dotted with bird excrement.<br />
I laughed and left, making sure that I didn&#8217;t let the bird into the hall. That would have caused a lot of trouble. The last thing we needed was to have hotel security going through the rooms. When I returned to my room, Jason was asleep. Whatever ailed him seemed to make him sleep like my cat, which is constantly. I took my Walkman and went out on the porch, where I listened to some tunes before going to bed.</p>

		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890708.16</strong><br />
<em>Day 9</em><br />
Today, we had a very wet tour of Sochi. This city of 130,000+ has only been here for about 150 years and does not have any significant history except for its Sanatoria, which are large health spas. They thrive on special mineral waters found in this area (they smell heavily of sulphur).<br />
After we got back, Jason, Derek and Kelly B. went scuba diving and I went to track down others in our group. I soon managed to find Greg, Pete, Toni and Lisa Van E. We went swimming, talked a bit and then went for lunch. There, Toni and Lisa were showing some &#8220;suggestive&#8221; moves (they had been doing it since this morning) to Mr. Phillips, who took it all in stride.<br />
At this point, Lisa realized (she actually declared it to the rest of us) that she was &#8220;The most covered up person on the beach.&#8221; This I heavily disagree with because there were several whales out there with bedsheets for bathing suits.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To say the very least, the weather we got that morning thoroughly pissed me off. This was weather I hoped we had escaped coming this far south. But much to my dismay, and Jason&#8217;s, it was raining. What was worse was that a week before, in every city that we had already visited, they had a record setting heat wave. This was unfair to say the very least. But seeing as we hadn&#8217;t yet developed the power to change the weather, we decided to venture down to the hotel&#8217;s restaurant for breakfast. As usual cheese, cold meats, eggs and bread were there.<br />
Then we were let in on the morning&#8217;s tour. It had to come, we were expecting it. But the only parts of Sochi we were going to look at were in Metropolitan Sochi, the northern end. All but one place actually, which was less than ten minutes from our hotel.<br />
Our bus returned to the road that had originally brought us down into the valley. As it was a one way street, we had to continue up the other side and back to the main highway, which was like Yonge Street (for those of you who know of it).<br />
We headed in a southerly direction, in a heading that would take us back to the airport. But we were going only as far at the outer limits of Metropolitan Sochi. Along the way, our guides pointed out the other Intourist hotels (they always looked better than the ones we stayed in too &#8212; why would we have stayed there after all? We don&#8217;t need that kind of opulence, we were only students). We also spotted a stage being set up for a concertNorth American style.<br />
Soon, we reached &#8220;Sulphur Valley&#8221;. If you&#8217;re wondering why I called it that, you would understand when you got a whiff of the air. It&#8217;s the sulphur that turns the Black Sea black and makes Sochi a major Soviet resort. In Sochi, there are countless Sanatoria. They aren&#8217;t insane asylums as the name might conjure up, but are actually health spas that exploit the sulphur rich waters to cure just about anything you can think of.<br />
We reached one of the more famous Sanatoria, which was large to boot. We never learned the name however, our tour guide seemed to be constantly on Valium, and was by far the worst tour guide we had during the trip. Despite the rain, most of us unloaded to take a look around. The guide took us over to the main building, to a corner thereof. Here we found a fountain pouring out the precious waters.<br />
A couple of the adults (Mr. McClelland and Mr. Findlay to be exact) went so far as to douse their balding heads. One of them exclaimed that their hair was growing back. But I doubted that was even possible. Just as things were beginning to look exceptionally dull, Mother Nature decided to spruce things up and let loose a downpour. You never saw thirty people move so fast to get back to a bus. I was running so fast, I accidentally ran right through the middle of a large puddle, completely soaking myself.<br />
The bus then worked its way back up the road we had come down on to return to the highway, and reentered Metro Sochi. But instead of getting off for our hotel, we went right by towards the centre of town. We eventually stopped at one of the city&#8217;s several gardens. But by the time we had gotten there, the rain had stopped (which was good timing on Mother Nature&#8217;s part if you ask me!). We unloaded and entered the main gates.<br />
It was a kind of Friendship Garden, every tree was planted through joint efforts from the citizens of Sochi and a sister city in the United States. In front of each tree was a clover shaped sign that read the names of people who planted them. One bore the name of Yuri Gagarin (this time I read it before we were told about it even though it was in Cyrillic) and another sign bore the name &#8220;ApolloSoyuz&#8221;.<br />
After our short jaunt through the &#8220;Garden of Delight&#8221;, we hopped back on our bus to return to our hotel, not far away. The weather had already reached awesome proportions. The sky was now clear and it was rapidly getting much warmer. As nothing else had been planned, it was beach time! Several people made a beeline for it, after making a quick side trip to their rooms to get changed. These people included Pete, Toni, Lisa V and Greg. Derek, Jason, Kelly and I took our time, and probably for the better.<br />
Undoubtedly, a few of us had to be caught completely off guard by the beach. Unlike the sandy beaches that we saw the day before, this beach lacked sand. It was made up primarily of fist sized stones. And hot ones at that. I was beginning to dislike this hotel more and more every minute. Derek, Jason, Kelly and I desperately tried to find the others. But there were simply too many people to look through and we had no idea where any of them were.<br />
Near the only entrance to the beach (which was run by the hotel), there were a few concessions that sold food and water equipment. One of these places offered scuba diving lessons, which before Perestroika were reserved for the military only. I guess they must have liked the idea because Derek, Jason and Kelly signed up for lessons, which began immediately. I on the other hand, chickened out. I&#8217;m not afraid of the water, I love it. It&#8217;s the mouthpieces I can&#8217;t use. I choke on them, anything that goes in my mouth I try to eat. My dentist calls me &#8220;Captain Choke&#8221;.<br />
Anyway, I resumed to the original task of finding my comrades before lunch rolled around. I left the main beach, thinking that they might have gone to another. Above most of the beach is a walkway for people who don&#8217;t want to go right into the beach area itself. This was a great help as it was much higher than the beach and gave me a good vantage point. But I still didn&#8217;t know what to look for.<br />
Then my eyes caught something. A small, neon green and black Body Glove bikini. Toni. And I knew that where I could find Toni, it was almost certain that Pete, Lisa and Greg could also be found. I was down there in a matter of seconds. It&#8217;s a bit unnerving to be walking along the beach and suddenly notice a topless sunbather. Normally this would have sent my hormones directly to my abdomen, but this time, nothing happened. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why. I didn&#8217;t think it was humanly possible to mature that quickly. So I dismissed that theory.<br />
I have to admit, I never did figure out how Toni could wear some of the things she did without feeling (or at least looking like) she was being ogled. And believe me, that was one of the smallest bathing suits on the beach (the only ones that were smaller came from the topless Italian women). I&#8217;m still kicking myself for not taking a picture. Of course, one of the reasons of going to any beach is to go swimming (another reason is to go &#8230; sightseeing). And we did. The Black Sea take a bit getting used to, but it&#8217;s reasonable warm for such a large body of water that far north.<br />
The swimming would have normally been rather dull if it weren&#8217;t for a breakwater that sat a scant 100 metres out in the water. It wasn&#8217;t a true breakwater as it didn&#8217;t stop the waves, but sat just below the water. The tricky part was getting on it without getting washed off. But that was also the problem, getting on. The waves caused quite a suction near the wall, which was studded with thousands of barnacles. My leg still bears the scars I received from bad timing.<br />
Lunch rolled around not long after. We were in for a bit of a surprise that day though. We had borscht for soup, but with a twist. We had, as we might call it &#8220;Weinies and Borscht&#8221;. It was actually quite good. I guess that the wieners canceled out the strong taste of the beets. You could still taste them, but they just weren&#8217;t as strong.<br />
We sat at one of the tables with Mr. Phillips, who had used his time to take a quick trip into town, where he managed to pick up some nectarines. But the growers had picked them a little early. They were under ripe and a bit on the hard side. Lisa V began to complain about her bathing suit, comparing it to Toni&#8217;s. I had no idea why she would even think of that. Toni&#8217;s had maybe one fifth the material that Lisa&#8217;s did. Then Lisa claimed to be, and I quite, &#8220;the most covered up person on the beach&#8221;. Although I didn&#8217;t mention it aloud, I did make a point to myself that there were several Soviet women out there that made blue whales look like ants. I didn&#8217;t even want to guess how much fabric their fifties style bathing suits used.<br />
About an hour later, Jason and I were back in our room, contemplating on the afternoon&#8217;s activities, as none had been planned for us. Then came a knock at the door. We had no idea who it was initially, but we assumed it would be someone from our group. It turned out to be a dude we met in the elevator on our way up there the first night. He was from Armenia, and spoke no English. We figured out where he was from when he shook his hands, indicating an earthquake.<br />
He did actually speak enough English to get his point across. He assumed we were American (the fool!) and wanted to see if he could exchange some of his money for an American dollar. He explained that he collected money and did not have one. And if you believe that one, I&#8217;m Josef Stalin. I only had a few American dollars left and did not want to give them away just then. We had been told of a dance that night (planned by none other than Derek and Greg) but we couldn&#8217;t get any tickets. As a result, we would have to try and bribe our way in.<br />
We chatted for a little while, finally convincing him that we were Canadians (he already had Canadian money) and that our American was to precious to give up. American cash incidentally, is quite valuable over there. Despite the official exchange rate at the time (approximately $2 CAN to 1 ruble), we could get 10 rubles for a buck!<br />
At this point in time, the devils in us began to break loose. They actually started the night before during our game of Asshole. After Jason and put some water in my extra strong concoction, everyone but me began to get a bit tipsy. This led to Shaun. His brain shorted out. It got so bad, he tried to use a bottle opener to open a bottle that had a screw top. When it didn&#8217;t work, he tossed it out the window in disgust.<br />
Well, it must&#8217;ve caught on, because a lot more things began to fly from other balconies. Someone on the thirteenth floor (probably the same one who lost the bottle opener) tossed a few water balloons into the parking below. That&#8217;s when the cops showed up. The next thing was paper airplanes. Many us got into the act on that one. But someone did the coup de grace that night. The overabundance of alcohol caused them to toss their cookies (in other words, they puked) &#8230; on a taxi.<br />
Eventually, dinner rolled around. I asked a few people if anyone had seen either Greg or Derek. I was curious as to where they had been all afternoon. But no-one had any idea at all. After dinner, I went up to the dance hall, and tried to get in. But I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to doing so. I don&#8217;t know why. Totally giving up, I retreated to the observation lounge on the fifteenth floor, and gazed down at the terrace around the dance hall. I could see everyone down there, but they couldn&#8217;t hear me.<br />
I was feeling sorry for myself, something which I now realize was utterly stupid. I did manage to force myself back downstairs and into the dance hall, along with several others. It cost us three rubles, but we got in. That&#8217;s when I found out about Greg and Derek&#8217;s problem. Their entire afternoon of planning went down the drain when the managers of the hall decided that the music that they planned was better than Derek and Greg&#8217;s. Given, Greg and Derek&#8217;s music was about six months ahead of the manager&#8217;s selection, so they would naturally be apprehensive. Greg made a constant vigil with the DJs trying to get them to play just one of their songs. Most of the stuff they played I recognized, but did not dance to.<br />
I&#8217;m scared to death of dancing, one might call it waltzaphobia. I explain it as having two left feet. I just don&#8217;t want to dance. Maybe it&#8217;s from a previous life. All I know is I can never venture out on a working dance floor and have good time. John Braniff was much the same way. Both he and I stayed outside, guarding our table which had just about everyone&#8217;s junk on it. Jason was also there, he didn&#8217;t dance either. However, if sixties music had come on, he would have gone too.<br />
Greg came bouncing out of the hall into the cool night air, sweatin&#8217; like a hog. Not only was it hot in there, but this dude was a heavy dancer. I asked him when they were going to play one of his songs. Almost as if in response, the beginning to &#8220;She Drives Me Crazy&#8221; thumped over the speakers. Almost instantly, everyone in our group who danced rushed in through the doors into the hall. I think there were three of us left outside. Five, tops!<br />
The ironic part of the whole thing was that the managers had said no-one would dance to the music that Derek and Greg had chosen. Most of the people on the dance floor were Russian. Even Radar, the sexual party-pooper of the group got into the act. He gave us a bit of a scare, as he was already married, and he seemed to be making passes at Marina (who was good looking too, for a Soviet woman), but we knew that his own family came first. He had the lot of us cheering (and jeering) at him.<br />
When I noticed this, I went over to Pete and Toni to tell them. They were standing away from the rest of the group and couldn&#8217;t see in the doors. Toni was quite pleased to hear it, she wanted revenge I suppose. I didn&#8217;t find out until the next day what Toni and Pete had been discussing. But according to Pete, their relationship was falling apart. At least one didn&#8217;t dump the other. At first Toni said they could work things out, but by the next morning, they had separated.<br />
Once again, the abundance of fresh air brought Mr. Sandman on. And this time he dumped the whole Sahara Desert on me. But I didn&#8217;t want to leave for bed. I wanted to stay. Jamie took off to find me a sugar cube, which I hoped would get me hyper, countering my sleepiness. Much to the delight of John, who really didn&#8217;t like Jamie getting me the cube, I didn&#8217;t get at all excited. I was simply too tired. It pissed me off, I was always getting tired just as things were getting interesting.<br />
Jason and Pete were at our table, discussing something over cheap wine. I bid them a good night, and made for the door. Ten minutes later, I was gazing out onto Sochi, listening to my music once again.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
It was a very solemn night for me and a few others. I had only Radar&#8217;s antics to help cheer me up. They weren&#8217;t enough. For the fifth or sixth time in my life, the one person I thought I might have had a chance with ended up clear out of my reach. The worst part is, she was the best one to date &#8230; I doubt I will every find anyone better. Part of the problem might be me, I just couldn&#8217;t ask Lisa to dance, even after I tried so hard to get in. I wish this trip was over.

		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890707.10</strong><br />
<em>Day 8</em><br />
Today, almost all of us &#8220;men&#8221; leave for Sochi, about 4 hours before any of the girls. Most of us are just laying around while the girls are at the beach (some have to do our collective study which Greg finally handed out). Lisa Van E. was either scared about being left alone or she was just fooling around. But with all the problems the girls have been having, I would be scared too. I just hope the weather in Sochi is good.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next morning was a fast one for some of us. Upon rising that sunny morning (only the second one so far), the three of us in our room began another hurried morning. Showers were first on tap to wake us up, then we had to restore the room to a semi ordered condition and pack our bags. Breakfast was next. It was here that we were filled in on our traveling status for the day. Odessa was moreorless a day stopover for us on our way to Sochi, a Black Sea resort. But instead of a train, it was an hour and a half flight.<br />
The part that we didn&#8217;t like was the segregation: boys went in the morning, girls in the afternoon. This was not of our choosing either. According to KB, this was Intourist&#8217;s work. I would have loved to hear the logic behind that one. Pete made a very verbal protest to the matter before we left, when we were all grouped in the lobby with our luggage. As you may recall, several of the girls, if not all, were being harassed by the Russian men. He wasn&#8217;t trying to be chauvinistic, he was being protective. After all, he and Toni were a thing at the time. But I think that most of us guys felt the same way.<br />
Some of us began to exchange ideas for the rationale to sending us first. One idea was that it was a dangerous place, and we were to make sure things were okay (yeah, right). Another was that a bunch of Russian men bribed officials at Intourist, but we didn&#8217;t like that one at all. Next thing we knew, we were on the bus saying goodbye to the others as we began our short journey to the airport. It seemed very odd, having the bus that empty and no girls aside from Marina.<br />
When we got to the airport, our luggage disappeared at the hands of porters again. We often wondered what happened to our bags. We then followed Marina to the Intourist desk, where she rattled something off in Russian to the clerk. A couple of minutes later, we were whipping through what I thought was security. I couldn&#8217;t believe how laxed it was. I could have smuggled anything onto that flight if I wanted. I could have gone so far as to blow it up! Anyway, we were then taken to a lobby of sorts where the group of us grabbed any seat we wanted, no-one else was there. Here we either played cards, talked, listened to music or crashed out all together.<br />
As I mentioned in the above paragraph, there was a small group of Jamie, John, Jason, Radar, Derek and Marina who played cards. The card game was none other than that cafeteria favorite, Asshole. It&#8217;s similar to another game that my parents call Hearts. I&#8217;ve never heard of it, but my knowledge of cards extends to crazy eights, solitaire and gambling games.<br />
Soon, we were dragging our butts outside to walk our way out to our plane. As we exited our way out to the runway, Konrad happened to notice something a little disturbing, our luggage &#8230; with tags marked &#8220;Turkey&#8221;. Well, that&#8217;s Konrad for you.<br />
We made the short climb into our Aeroflot plane, not much different than the one that had brought us into the Soviet Union to begin with. As in all small Soviet jets, they had very low set landing gear so boarding was not hard at all. Again, the cabin was pressurized with the aide of misty air. But this time, there was a twist to the moist air. The vents began to drip. The water wasn&#8217;t clear either, it was rusty. It doesn&#8217;t do your clothes good when it drips on them.<br />
During our flight, Radar made an examination of my journal to date. Marina read it too. I still wonder what she thought of me when she read my crack at Aeroflot. Then he wrote the following in my journal:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very interesting to this point. Excellent observations. I was glad to hear how much you appreciate the independent geography tour from the train window as we approached Odessa. (He would, after all, he was the Geography teacher.) I am very sorry that I did not wake you any earlier, perhaps next time.<br />
Thanks for sharing, &#8220;Radar&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>After about an hour and a half, our plane finally began to descend into Sochi. After being stuck next to a rather large Russian man, who was the most untalkative person I had ever seen, for almost two hours, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get outside.<br />
We had a wild pilot, a bit more off the air than our previous bus driver, Alexsi. Now Alexsi might have lost his license, but our pilot tried to parallel park the plane while landing! Our plane came to its parking spot and we unloaded as fast as we could. However, it would have been a better idea to stay inside. The outside was very muggy and extremely warm in comparison to all the other places we had already visited. Then we loaded up on a shuttle bus that whisked us over to the terminal. It was probably for the better, the tarmac was hot and the noise from all the planes was deafening. I&#8217;ll say one thing for Russian planes, they&#8217;re loud.<br />
The heat got to us very quickly. Every one of us grabbed at least one bottle of Pepsi, the only commercially available soft drink we recognized. I myself am a Coke drinker, but the Pepsi was a welcome sight. A few minutes, we were on another bus, exactly the same as all the others we had been in so far. All of the older Intourist buses are the same, red on the outside with 45 seats inside. All recline, but only if they work. The tape decks also stink.<br />
We then had another 45 minute trip to our hotel, all the while we were still in Sochi. The city is quite thin, less than four miles in width. But it&#8217;s 90 miles long. The airport&#8217;s at one end, the downtown core is at the other, along with our hotel. It was during the trip to our hotel that we were formally introduced to the Caucuses. It&#8217;s a very beautiful place, high mountains covered in trees with yawning abysses between them. The sea on our opposite side was dark, but inviting and the sandy beaches were almost a Godsend.<br />
Soon, we found ourselves turning off the highway to our hotel. It sat in a shallow valley at the area one would normally see an emerging river, but there was none. Just the Zhemchuzina, our hotel. We all piled off the bus from our seats and back into the warm, sticky air. After such cool cities, it was nice to be back in the warm air. The rest of our bags, except our large luggage also came off with us.<br />
This was easily the largest hotel we had been in to date. It was fifteen stories high (the fifteenth was an Observation Deck) and about forty to fifty rooms wide. As we entered the doors, the doorman (yes, there was a doorman) mistook us for Americans. Many Soviets did. But Jason corrected them &#8230;<br />
&#8220;CANADIANS! Get it right! We aren&#8217;t Americans, we are Canadians dammit!&#8221; he screamed.<br />
&#8220;Calm down Jason.&#8221; I said, pulling him along. I could imagine what the doorman was thinking: &#8220;Crazy Yankees!&#8221;<br />
A truck pulled up not long after us. It carried our luggage from the plane. It hadn&#8217;t gone to Turkey after all. Jason and I had already turned in our passports, so we grabbed our stuff to haul up to our room. Fourteenth floor. It was elevator time! Just before we left to go upstairs, we heard someone start yelling from our group. I never found out who it was but I soon found out what they were yelling about. Much to their delight, they found out that there was a Heinekin Bar on the C level.<br />
Ten minutes later, (I&#8217;m not kidding, the elevator took that long) we were looking out our window facing towards the north, towards the downtown core of Sochi, with a wicked view of the main door below and just to the right. Our next door neighbors turned out to be Pete and Derek. I had to admit that the next four days were going to be an interesting four days. The first of many strange incidents was to come later that night.<br />
But first, we had to endure dinner. We got another shock when we arrived. Something was missing: the fish. There was no fish at all. Either this was the fish&#8217;s night off or they forgot it. But we didn&#8217;t care. At least we didn&#8217;t have to eat fish! (I can&#8217;t emphasize fish enoughFISHFISHFISHFISH!) Afterwards Pete, Derek, Shaun, Jason and myself retreated to Pete and Derek&#8217;s room. Within a few seconds Jason, Shaun and Derek were playing Asshole. Pete was catching up on his journal writing but needed my journal to do so. Pete made the mistake of not keeping up, I was one of a small handful who had kept up.<br />
Then I realized my error. For several years before the trip, I was infamous amongst my friends for my antisocial habits, I was a Vulcan at heart if you will. I have no idea what really happened but something, or someone sent me into emotional turmoil. Next thing I knew, I wrote the following journal entry:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
It&#8217;s only 13:35 (1:35 in the afternoon for those of you who can&#8217;t read 24 hour time) and I already miss the girls. Why exactly I don&#8217;t know because I&#8217;m not normally an emotional person. Probably the person I miss the most is Lisa Van E<!--gmond-->. This is most likely because she has the same values and interests I do. She also writes long journals.</p></blockquote>
<p>I had totally forgotten this entry, I was too wrapped up in the events of the day. When I did realize, I decided that maybe it was the time to own up to myself. I did nothing. But then Pete mentioned it. At first I was a bit caught off guard, I didn&#8217;t think that he would say anything. The last crush I had on anyone was four years before. Since then, I had been completely inactive socially. But I did not bother to hide the fact, I admitted it without regret. It may have been one of the most intelligent moves I had ever made. Pete then mentioned that it took a man of great integrity to say something like that. Either that, or he was completely off his rocker. I like to think it was both.<br />
Soon, both Pete and I were actively watching the trio play Asshole, having a riot while doing so. They thought it was a blast. Pete however, knew something even funnier &#8230; playing it while you were slightly sloshed.<br />
Almost instantly, Jason recalled the bottle of vodka he had purchased in Zagorsk. Some was gone, but not all of it. I myself had brought Tang crystals for adding a little flavour to the water. Jason put one and one to get &#8230; Vodka and orange juice! However, they made the mistake of trusting the mixing of a potentially disastrous drink to someone who dislikes alcohol. No matter, I thought I could do it, I mixed drinks for my parents all the time.<br />
That hotel didn&#8217;t supply any pitchers, but I still needed something to mix the concoction in. The best I could do was an empty flower vase. I emptied the remainder of the vodka into the bottle and mixed in the other necessary ingredients. As for mixing, the hotel didn&#8217;t provide swizzle sticks either, a Papermate pen had to suffice.<br />
Proudly, I brought the vase and it&#8217;s contents back into the other room. I plopped the vase in the middle of the table and Shaun pounced on it like a hungry panther, taking a huge mouthful from it. Almost instantly, his face turned to pure shock. He exploded from his chair, raced out to the balcony and spewed the contents of his mouth into the cool night air, and onto the heads of passersby below. Then he wheeled around to glare at me.<br />
&#8220;What the hell&#8217;s in there?!?&#8221; he yelled.<br />
&#8220;Vodka and Tang crystals,&#8221; I replied.<br />
&#8220;Where the f&#8211;k is the water?!?&#8221; he screamed.<br />
&#8220;What water?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t realize that water was one of the requirements. Somehow, the thought had completely slipped my mind. Silly me!<br />
At this point, they all burst out laughing, simultaneously screaming &#8220;YOU ASSHOLE!&#8221; at me. This prompted me to break out laughing as well. So the five of us laughed ourselves silly. Don&#8217;t ask me why, it probably sounds strange as hell to you, but that&#8217;s what happened! After what seemed an eternity, we finally gained control of our funny bones. That night still plagues me, and I have to bite my tongue to keep from laughing in the middle of classes.<br />
After a little while, the guys got quite pissed. Not completely drunk, but a bit tipsy. We ventured out into the hall for some reason (I can&#8217;t remember what) and ran into some guy from California. The four of them then managed to scare the living shit out of him. But it wasn&#8217;t intentional. I think.<br />
A little while after that most hysterical incident, the females arrived from their journey. While most of us declined to come down, Pete and I decided that we would be the welcome wagon for the remainder of our group. By the time we got down there (we happened to be lucky enough to catch the elevator, reducing the time to five minutes to get down), everything had been unloaded and they were getting their rooms. Pete and I instantly went into welcome mode.<br />
While I was chatting away with Lisa V, Greg appeared. He was rooming with Andrew, who had come with us in the morning. Greg had already taken his junk upstairs and was now dancing around to the tunes from his Walkman, constantly babbling something about an English dance hall. I hadn&#8217;t a clue what he meant then, and even after a year, I still don&#8217;t know.<br />
Then Pete and I &#8220;escorted&#8221;, if you will, Toni and Lisa V to their respectful room. Then we signed in for the night, as the arrival of the girls signified the end of an otherwise semi-inactive night (providing you exclude our antics up until that point). But neither Jason or I went directly to bed. Instead we went out on our balcony, plopped tapes into our Walkmans (Jason borrowed Pete&#8217;s), set our feet on the ledge and gazed into the city. The bright lights made it look more like a typical North American city than a Communist one. I almost felt at home.</p>
<blockquote><p> <strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplemental</strong><br />
Tonight, Derek, Jason, Pete, Shaun and myself got together in Pete and Derek&#8217;s room (actually, Denmark&#8217;s, which is Derek&#8217;s nickname, courtesy of Toni &#8220;Sven&#8221; Nixon) to play a card game called Asshole. While playing (I was watching, Pete was writing his journal) the question of ever playing the game when you were drunk. Jason recalled his vodka and my juice crystals. So he sent me to mix up some drinks. Little did I know that you are to add water to the concoction. The end result was a super-powerful drink which no-one could touch (I don&#8217;t drink so it doesn&#8217;t matter to me).</p></blockquote>
