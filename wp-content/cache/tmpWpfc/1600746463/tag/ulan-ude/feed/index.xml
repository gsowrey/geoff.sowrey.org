										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03526.JPG" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" width="300" /></a><br />
Our British Airways 747 to London:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03527.JPG" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" width="300" /></a><br />
The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03533.JPG" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a><br />

And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a><br />
We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a><br />
A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a><br />
Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a><br />
I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03674.JPG" alt="Get on the train!" width="300" /></a><br />
Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03675.JPG" alt="No Flowing Back" width="300" /></a><br />
One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />

Ferry traffic!<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03703.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a><br />

Jackie Chan apparently heavily sponsors California Fitness. He&#8217;s probably an owner.<br />

Inside our favourite dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong:<br />

We had this at a sushi restaurant in Chiba. We thought it was some weird pickled eel. It was eggplant:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve reached the end of our time here in Russia. Tomorrow morning, early, we&#8217;re off to Mongolia. And a 10+ hour border-crossing, so we&#8217;re told. It&#8217;s simultaneously a horror story and a quest of patience, so it seems.<br />
After we arrived last night, literally 10 minutes into being in our new hotel room, the phone rang. It was &#8220;Helga from St. Petersburg&#8221;. Being more than just a little out of it, I assumed Helga was our tour operator, and was arranging our tour for tomorrow. She said she would be in the hotel, and we could meet her in the &#8220;cafeteria&#8221; (more like a bar with food). This was great since she had our train tickets to Ulaan Baatar, and would give us the details for our tour to the Datsun &#8212; the Buddhist template near Ulan Ude.<br />
<span id="more-546"></span>We walked into the cafe (as it&#8217;s referred to) about 20 minutes later only to find, much to our deep surprise, Helga &#8212; the woman we&#8217;d met in St. Petersburg whom we&#8217;d tried very desperately to avoid. (Helga had originally asked for all the details of our trip so she could tag along with us, not wanting to do the trip alone. We weren&#8217;t particularly happy about that, since we&#8217;d spent so much time and effort planning to this as a duo &#8212; not a trio.) This was not the surprise I&#8217;d wanted.<br />
Since Helga had some of the information we needed, we opted to talk with her until she left for her homestay, some distance from the Hotel Geser. Why did she have all this information? She ran into the tour guide we were using, and had signed up for the same tour to the Datsun.<br />
The trip out today was quite nice, actually. Ulan Ude is in a steppe valley, which is wide, expansive, and fairly flat. It&#8217;s dominated more by <em>dacha</em> (small cottages). Otherwise, short grasses and free-roaming animals (cows, goats, horses) which are &#8220;owned&#8221; by the local buryat inhabitants. The region we&#8217;re in is named for them: Buryatia. They&#8217;re an offshoot of Mongolian society, who&#8217;ve decided not to be nomadic and settle permanently.<br />
The result of the Mongolian influence in this area brings the Buddhism, which is what we&#8217;d planned to see today. <a href="http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/russia.htm">Ivolginsky Datsun</a> dates back only to 1947, when Stalin (of all people!) allowed limited religious practices for recognized minorities, such as the buryats.<br />
On the 30 km drive out to the Datsun, our guide Ilyena (I believe that was her name) attempted to explain the history of Ulan Ude, the general environment around us, and the basics of Buddhism. All of which Helga continually interrupted with questions &#8212; some decent, but mostly inane. And annoying, since Ilyena was continually put off her speech, and found it difficult to continue. Thankfully, Amy and I have a good understanding of Buddhism, and had read much about the area through our guidebooks.<br />
The Datsun itself is quite interesting. Because it was built only a little over a half century ago (and even then, the main temple burned down just before it initially was to open), most of the buildings are reminiscent of Soviet construction: big and stolid. Yet there is still a blending with Buddhist stylings, with all the statuary and stupas one would expect to find. Though here, they&#8217;re made of concrete and not wood or stone. The insides of the temples, though still Buddhist, borrow concepts from Russian churches (such as windows and high ceilings), a result of Russian influences on the Buryats when they tried to settle in the area.<br />
There were few other tourists there than ourselves, so we had a fairly easy time getting around. Although Ivolginsky Datsun is the centre for Russian buddhism, it&#8217;s not heavily visited at all times. There are strong ties here with both Mongolia (which is a very powerful buddhist centre, so I&#8217;ve learned) and, of course, Tibet.<br />
On the way back, we got to ask Ilyena a few questions. Well, to be most specific, Amy and I got to ask a few questions &#8212; Helga wouldn&#8217;t let up. To the point where she was outright challenging Ilyena about the differences between hardships under Soviet rule versus Helga&#8217;s post-war upbringing in the late 1940s &#8211; early 1950s. It was enough for me to bite my tongue &#8212; hard &#8212; and not suggest that Helga put a cork in it. It&#8217;s enough to ask questions, but an entirely different thing to disrespect your hosts by suggesting their troubles in life are trivial.<br />
We finally ditched Helga, and picked up our train tickets for tomorrow, and went off to explore the rest of Ulan Ude. Admittedly, there isn&#8217;t much else to see in this city, save for two museums that aren&#8217;t easy to get to. Across the road from our end-point was a nice opera theatre that looked almost like it had been plucked out from Spain. Next door to that was the Mongolian Embassy.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03587.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude and the opera house" width="300" /></a><br />
Down the road (to the south) was the GUM department store and market &#8212; of which there wasn&#8217;t much. However, there were <strong>delectable</strong> blinni &#8212; which are crepe-like packages filled with (in our case) cheese and ham. The pedestrian mall took us down to a recently-renovated church, before we walked back towards our hotel, and the world&#8217;s largest Lenin head.<br />

Why is the world&#8217;s largest Lenin head in Ulan Ude? Got me. I can see it from this computer. It&#8217;s <em>HUGE</em>. It&#8217;s at least two storeys tall. The body, if there were one, would tower over Ulan Ude. Vlad-zilla!<br />
We&#8217;re preparing for tomorrow&#8217;s trip. Not just with supplies (food and water), but also mentally. Mongolians like to smuggle things across the border, and we need to be prepared for the possibility that they might try to muscle their way into our compartment &#8212; which we bought all the seats in to prevent us getting caught with smugglers.<br />
Either way, the next time you hear from us, we&#8217;ll be in another country.</p>

It&#8217;s a nice little city of about a half million &#8230; and no birch trees!!! <em>Finally.</em><br />
We&#8217;ll be here until <strong>early</strong> tomorrow morning, when we leave for Mongolia. I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to such an early morning, I&#8217;ll tell you.<br />
Slept mostly on the train, which was about the only way to pass through the pain. It&#8217;s a six and a half hour trip from Irkutsk to Ulan Ude, a distance of no more than 300 km (straight-line, that is). The train needs to take a few bendy twists going through the mountains, pass through a couple of tunnels, and then plods along at an agonizingly slow 50 km/h (estimated). I think we topped out at a few places around 80.<br />
The eastern shore of Lake Baikal was frozen &#8212; ice as far as you could see. The exact opposite of what we&#8217;d seen in Listvyanka two days ago. It looks like it&#8217;s thawing quickly, though, so it shouldn&#8217;t be long before the clear waters show through.<br />
Two of our housemates in Irkutsk (a pair of Aussies) told us two things: 1) that we&#8217;d love Mongolia (something we&#8217;d both strongly suspected), and 2) China would wear us down fast. It&#8217;s chaotic, the toilets are disaster areas (that actually scares us), the &#8220;queues&#8221; aren&#8217;t, and pretty much everything we&#8217;d wanted to see is buried under scaffolding. It seems everyone is upgrading this year.<br />
We&#8217;re just waiting for our tour to start today &#8212; we actually got a guide for here &#8212; and will be back later with more. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
