								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, the wedding&#8217;s done, Tamara and Dan are wed, and pretty much everyone is pooped. The bridal party was out late the night before, the groom&#8217;s group was fairly tired, and I&#8217;m just beat from all the running around. My feet are killing me.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t the shortest wedding I&#8217;ve been to, but it was definitely more expedient than most of the ones I&#8217;ve seen. That said, it was still a lovely ceremony.<br />
<span id="more-910"></span>I followed Tamara most of the day, her unofficial tied-to-the-hip photographer. Hair, make-up, nails, ceremony preparation, and post-professional pictures, before all heading off to dinner. I was fortunate enough to be treated almost like the wedding party without actually being one of them. It was nice to be considered in such a way, especially when it wasn&#8217;t really place.<br />
Yes, Tamara cried. So did I. (I cry at every wedding.) It&#8217;s hard not to when things turn out that well. The wedding chapel at the Mandalay Bay might be a bit &#8220;assembly line&#8221;-ish, but it&#8217;s really a nice way to have weddings. It&#8217;s definitely not your stereotypical Vegas chapel. Not an Elvis to be seen.<br />
Following the ceremony and the post-professional pictures, we all went to Chinois at the Forum Shops. It&#8217;s a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. Very tasty. Our &#8220;private room&#8221; was a great balcony overlooking the mall itself. It wasn&#8217;t loud at all, and much rejoicing was had.<br />
But now I stand in Maccaran International, awaiting my flight home at 2:10. Yes, that&#8217;s 02:10, as in AM, after midnight. I land in Calgary just before 6, then head right into work. Yes, I&#8217;m insane. But you already knew that.<br />
So to the newly-minted couple, I offer only my best hopes and wishes for life, love, and happiness. The minister was right &#8212; there is no gambling in love. There are no &#8220;ifs&#8221; or &#8220;in case of fires&#8221;. There is compromise and understanding, but love has a way of making that almost easy. May your remaining days in Las Vegas be full of fun and rest (you guys need it), and we all look forward to seeing you in Calgary.<br />
Congratulations my friends. And thank you for letting me be a part of your day in the sun.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/wedding/kathryn-and-andreas-wedding/">My friend Kathryn got married this weekend.</a> A truly wonderful event that forced my hand to leave the comfort of my familiar Cowtown (and miss the opening of the Calgary Stampede) to visit rural Ontario and experience the joyous event.<br />
I gotta say, probably the most relaxful weekend I&#8217;ve had in &#8230; well, a really long time.<br />
<span id="more-766"></span>It started with a fairly hectic departure on Thursday afternoon. Alex drove me to the airport, I had to run out to a flight, which although I made with a bit of time to spare, ended up being late no thanks to the caterers. (In other words, less food on the plane than there should have been.)<br />
And although I flew Air Canada &#8212; [[Air Canada sucks|perhaps my least favourite airline]] &#8212; I had a really good experience. I was pleasantly surprised. Still, I&#8217;ll fly WestJet because I like it. Arrived in Toronto, checked into the airport Sheraton, and had a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
The following day, I picked up my rental car, and proceeded to drive out to Beaverton. The Ford Focus has been a decent car, though I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d run out and buy one. It&#8217;s okay, but far from perfect.<br />
The drive took my through stomping grounds not trampled in many years. I turned north in Whitby (having accidentally gone as far as Oshawa) up Highway 12.<br />
As soon as I felt I was out of the urban area, I turned off the air conditioning, rolled down the windows, and turned my iPod to play nothing but <em>The Tragically Hip</em>. It&#8217;s been years since I did this. I&#8217;d been thinking of it for a couple of weeks, and it was a thoroughly liberating experience to blare over 15 years&#8217; of music as I blasted through the plains of rural Ontario. How I missed the experience.<br />
Along the way, I found a few abandoned rail lines (I need to figure out which they were), back roads, and small towns I&#8217;d never been to (or through). <a href="http://www.beavertononlakesimcoe.com/">Beaverton </a>itself is a rather interesting little place, and the sort of place you would buy a small cottage for weekend (or summer) escapes. This is where Andrea&#8217;s parents have retired to, though they&#8217;re not even in Beaverton proper, prefering more remote locations.<br />
I actually got lost finding the place. Well, not lost per se, but I definitely overshot  where I needed to be by 15 clicks or so. Rather embarrassing for someone  who would normally pride themselves on knowing where they were and where they were going. (See, hon, I&#8217;m saying I was wrong. Take note of this!)<br />
Imaging driving up a corduroy road. Weeds standing shoulder high. No ferris wheel rusting off in the distance, but there&#8217;s not much else. Suddenly, there&#8217;s a break in the bush at the side of the road. The path is full of stones turned white from age and abuse. It looks like danger to go down it. At the end is a clearing with a gorgeous brick farmhouse, manicured lawns, and enough clear cut grass to park cars.<br />
This is where all the fun took place. And it was only as I came into the  yard that I realised something I had not thought of before:<br />
Would I know anyone there?<br />
It dawned on me that aside from Kathryn&#8217;s family &#8212; who barely recognised me in the 12-odd years since I last saw them &#8212; I didn&#8217;t know anyone. I was one of the oldest friends Kathryn had there. If not the oldest. I feel old just <em>thinking </em>about it! But as I talked with Maureen &#8212; Kathryn&#8217;s mom &#8212; I spied the names of Gerry and Sam, mutual friends whom I&#8217;d met through Chris years ago. (Gerry and I had done a trans-Canada trip back in 1997, and I went their <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/wedding/gerry-and-sam/">wedding in 2001</a>.)<br />
At least I wasn&#8217;t alone.<br />
Although I was uncomfortable in the heat (not as bad as [[Je suis en Paris, Jour Trois!|Paris last summer]]), the ceremony was wonderful, the food excellent, and I had a great time catching up with my old friends. It had been a very long time since I&#8217;d had a good chat with Gerry and Sam. Just made me remember why I like them so much.<br />
The night carried on and soon dinner was over, the dancing begun, and the mosquitoes were out in swarms. We lathered up with repellent to prevent severe blood loss, but even that wasn&#8217;t enough for some.<br />
I met up with Marika, Kathryn&#8217;s friend for many years [[Kathryn comes for a visit|whom had stayed at Chris&#8217; and my apartment back in 2001]]. She in turn pointed out Bryce, whom I&#8217;d met the night of the Camelot show.<br />
Insert singing dolls here.<br />
I had to leave around 22:00, as I still had 90 minutes to drive. I wasn&#8217;t going back towards the airport, but up to Huntsville to hang out with my family for the rest of the weekend. (I figured I had to make the most of the time.)<br />
I said goodbye to Gerry and Sam, which seemed such a shame &#8212; I rarely get to see or chat to them and leaving so soon just seemed so wrong. I was sorry to say goodbye to Kathryn as well, since I&#8217;d barely had a chance to talk to her. I wasn&#8217;t the furthest away to come (Marika beat me &#8212; she came from Vancouver), but it&#8217;s still hard to see someone only a short while.<br />
The drive up to Huntsville was punctuated by road signs I could barely read, drivers who seemed to not know where they were going, and the need for high beams so I could see in the intense black of the northern Ontario night. At the end, Craig was waiting for me with a beer.<br />
In a weird way, it was sort of home. In a very confused, fast-paced, intense, and long-distance way, that is.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year ago, I got married. Something that until a couple of years ago, I never thought I&#8217;d do. I&#8217;d been bitten hard, and I couldn&#8217;t do it. Couldn&#8217;t even imagine it. It takes the right person, and the right situation, to make something like marriage seem feasible, even exciting. And until a couple of years ago, I don&#8217;t think I was even mentally ready for it. It&#8217;s a big commitment, one that many people don&#8217;t really appreciate. It&#8217;s just a &#8220;thing to do&#8221;. Witness the divorce rate&#8230;<br />
Today is the first anniversary. We&#8217;ll be going to Mozart in the Mountain, the first concert of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s season. (Obviously, I&#8217;m writing this entry in advance.) I&#8217;m also arranging a night at the Banff Springs Hotel as a sort of celebration. Hopefully it all goes well. But this entry isn&#8217;t about this year&#8217;s anniversary. I want to tell you a story about my wedding, and how things don&#8217;t always go as planned. To set the stage, I give you two words:<br />
Food poisoning.<br />
This all started on the Tuesday before, 23 August 2005. Exactly how, I can&#8217;t tell you. Not because I don&#8217;t want to, but because I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve talked about this endlessly trying to figure out exactly what happened. All I do know is that I ingested <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter">Campylobacter jejuni</a></em>, a rather nasty gut bug that takes a few days to incubate and do its thing. There are a couple of possibilities, but nothing that I would consider conclusive. When when you&#8217;re &#8220;best friend&#8221; happens to be Murphy, you know that it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; you were going to get it anyway.<br />
Skip ahead to Friday, the 26th. My friends Stuart and Therese were in town for the wedding with their daughter, and we&#8217;d all gone out to Chilliwack to have dinner with my family at a cabin they&#8217;d rented. Clams, mussels, and steak. At the time, we were waiting for news of Teak picking Chris up from the airport (having flown in from Japan) and we would all meet at the Mission Best Western, where Therese and Stuart were staying.<br />
It took a while for Chris and Teak to get back. Teak took a few wrong turns in Vancouver (which is very easy if you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going) and they ended up having to stop for dinner along the way. Stuart and I ended up waiting in the hotel&#8217;s restaurant/bar (Therese baby-sat, under the intention of swapping with Stuart once Chris arrived).<br />
Around 23:15, I decided it might be necessary to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;d only had 1/2 of a bottle of beer, though plenty other liquids (I had a bit of a headache, but nothing I&#8217;d consider bad). When I stood up, I knew something was wrong. There was that twinge of nausea that suggested something was amiss, and I <em>really</em> needed to go to the bathroom.<br />
When Chris and Teak finally arrived just after midnight, my head was swimming. I couldn&#8217;t see straight without a lot of effort. There was no way I was going back to Chilliwack that evening (I was supposed to stay with my family). I begged Teak and Chris to crash in their hotel room. I managed to (somehow) drive back to their place in Maple Ridge (about 20 minutes) without causing an accident. I pulled out my sleeping back, curled up on the floor, and proceeded to suffer a tired, awkward, sweaty, and painful half-sleep until my alarm went off at 7:00 the next morning.<br />
By that point, I&#8217;d made a few trips to the bathroom. None of them were to vomit, thankfully, but every trip just reinforced that something was wrong. Teak&#8217;s Advil didn&#8217;t bring much relief. The pressure of the things that needed to be done before 13:00 however, allowed me to concentrate on other things. That, and a stop to the 7-11 along the way to pick up Gatorade seemed to help a bit.<br />
While Alex was getting her hair done (I hadn&#8217;t seen her since early-afternoon the day before), I ran around setting up tables, arranging placements, getting chairs into their locations. Teak and Chris had graciously loaned me their time to help decorating, though we didn&#8217;t really need a lot of it. Mostly just to hide the rather unattractive corners of the tent.<br />
An early-morning call to the bakery had discovered that our order for cupcakes would be ready for 15:00 &#8230; two hours <em>after</em> when we actually needed them. My head still swimming, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to hear that, and strongly suggested that they recheck their schedule, as I was to pick them up around 11:00, and I could only afford the trip into Abbotsford once. After a few minutes of discussion, they assured me it would be ready on time.<br />
My gut started to feel a little like a saltwater taffy puller. Things were moving, and it wasn&#8217;t comfortable. I hadn&#8217;t eaten much to speak of, but hunger was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted was to have the day go off without a hitch. While Chris and Teak toiled away with their decorating, I headed to the bakery to get our cupcakes.<br />
By the time I&#8217;d arrived back, guests were already in attendance. I was in grubby clothes, unwashed hair and unshaven. Not to mention feeling wholly gross from the exploding infection in my bowels. And to top it all off, the two wait staff that we&#8217;d hired promptly asked where they could find the ice.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten the ice.<br />
After the fastest trip yet seen from the house to the corner store and back, I retreated to the basement to try and get ready. I figured a hot shower would help. All it did was call out to the dull ache in my lower back. The shave was like scraping nerve endings. I looked like I hadn&#8217;t slept in a week. I suited up nonetheless, determined not to let some lousy, stupid illness put an end to something that we&#8217;d been planning for months. Ache or no ache, the show had to go on.<br />
Everyone seemed to notice immediately that I wasn&#8217;t feeling up to scratch. But most people &#8212; including my lovely wife-to-be &#8212; were convinced that it was only &#8220;nerves&#8221;. I humoured them and went along with it, but knowing full well the difference between nerves and illness. For the most part, it wasn&#8217;t too bad, I was able to work with what we had, mingling and wandering around, before we actually went into wedding mode. Tie and jacket added, we started the service.<br />
Like most things in our wedding, it was largely unplanned. We had an approximate idea of what we needed, but we didn&#8217;t rehearse (no need to) and didn&#8217;t know how long it would take Paul to go through the speeches. In reality, I have no idea how long the service actually went. All I do know is that the shoes (new) combined with a lot of standing and the seemingly full-on assault to my inner abdomen was wreaking havoc with my back. Spasms periodically shook through my spine and it was everything to bite my tongue and tell Paul to move it along a bit quicker.<br />
To this day, Alex still says I didn&#8217;t enjoy my day. It wasn&#8217;t that I hated it, far from it &#8212; weddings are meant to be wonderful days, and we&#8217;d planned ours in that way on purpose. But I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as her. I couldn&#8217;t eat. I couldn&#8217;t drink. I couldn&#8217;t think clearly. I didn&#8217;t get to partake of all the mingling that I&#8217;d wanted to. Taking the photographs afterwards was almost torture. I looked for every opportunity to sit down. In fact, one of my favourite pictures of us was when we were seated, and I was resting my head on Alex&#8217;s shoulder from sheer exhaustion. It looks angelic in print, even if it belies the torture going on underneath.<br />
The lack of clarity of thought really cut out a few things that I would have liked to do, namely get pictures of myself with those in attendance. As such, we have very little with those who came from afar. It&#8217;s my only regret of the day. The event wrapped up around 18:00 with people heading out into the evening. When most people had left, I headed back downstairs to get myself out of my suit and into something that felt less restrictive. The bed in the room I was changing in looked so inviting that I just couldn&#8217;t resist laying down for a moment.<br />
Alex found me there, passed out. When I awoke, the room spun in wild circles, like a midway ride gone wrong. I had to shut them almost immediately to prevent nausea. Alex let me rest another 30 minutes before we left for our hotel room in Langley. The trip there was hell. Every bump in the road sent pains up my body. Even the cool breeze didn&#8217;t help to clear anything. A card that Chris gave me sent me bawling from emotional overload. Though only a 30-minute trip, even 30 seconds was too long to get there.<br />
The running joke of the wedding night is this: hot and sweaty, without a lot of sleep. And that was just me.<br />
Despite a hot bath and almost having to call the biohazard disposal team from what had escaped from me (again, no vomiting), I still fired up the furnace of illness, actually forcing Alex to sleep at the far edge of the bed from me. It was too hot, even for her. The opposing chills that came were equally intolerable.<br />
The next morning I actually felt marginally better. I ate for the first time in almost a day and a half &#8212; a carrot muffin &#8212; before we headed out for our honeymoon. The idea had originally been to drive to Fairmont, a drive of about nine hours. But that had been scrapped even before my illness, when we realized that it was just unrealistic. Revelstoke seemed much better for our first leg. But even though I felt good enough to drive, we didn&#8217;t even make it as far as the Coquihalla Toll Booth. My system was going down again. Thirty minutes from Kamloops, my hips felt like they were imploding, my legs wouldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
They say married men live longer than single men. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re married, it&#8217;s because single men don&#8217;t have someone to force them to go to hospital when something&#8217;s wrong.<br />
For the record, the Royal Inland Hospital is a very nice facility that offers some really decent healthcare. They triaged me right away, including a bracelet and a urine test. I had to wait only a few minutes to get a bed, my own heart monitor (and blood oxygen monitor), and a nurse that checked in on me to get more information about how I was feeling. Alex was more distracted by all the gadgets in the curtained area than about me at this point &#8212; the problems with marrying someone in the health care industry&#8230;<br />
The trouble really came when the doctor came in. A decent fellow, he thought maybe the shellfish could be culprit, but he seemed doubtful. He carried out a conversation fairly nonchalantly, repeating most of the same topics the nurse had covered not long before. He was so smooth about it that he almost managed to get me to miss the blood test and IV he wanted to put me on.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already heard, I don&#8217;t like needles. I hate them. Loathe them. Despise them. And now he wanted to put something in me not for a few moments, but a few <em>hours</em> to &#8230; do something (I didn&#8217;t ask what). I immediately started reacting by suggesting that there must be some other way. The doctor, wisely, looked at my new wife for support. She just looked at me, smiled, and softly said: &#8220;Suck it up, buttercup!&#8221;<br />
For the record, it was the best thing that could happen. Blood tests ain&#8217;t my thing, and while I didn&#8217;t dig the IV (having to take it down the hall to the toilet to deliver the ol&#8217; poop-in-a-hat test was something I never thought I&#8217;d have to do one day), I felt immeasurably better for having taken the two litres of saline. The majority of my issues were due to dehydration, and this was the best way to get me back on track.<br />
The doctor also informed us that the bacterial infection could potentially spread through body fluids, so we had to keep our respective distance for a few days. On our honeymoon, no less. The ultimate torture for newlyweds. But at least the cramping was gone and I didn&#8217;t have any relapses. It wasn&#8217;t until I got back to Calgary that I found out what I&#8217;d actually had (not the shellfish, that much was certain). Source unknown, but culprit found.<br />
One day, down the road, we&#8217;ll probably get remarried. Something fun, simple, and easy. And hopefully free of nasty bacteria.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I woke just before sunrise. I probably should have gotten up to look around, but decided that I&#8217;d rather sleep a bit more. I had a sneaky suspicion that it was going to be a long day.<br />
I woke again around 7:00, when my alarm went off. Jen sounded like she was still asleep (though she claims she wasn&#8217;t), so I opted not to disturb her and went to go see what the area looked like with the rising sun.<br />
<span id="more-335"></span>Back up to the roof and the observation deck, I took in the morning glory of Irako, and the mouth of the bay beyond the tip of the peninsula. Smog lined the shores on the other side, it&#8217;s thick, brown haze unmistakable. (By noon, the brown would be replaced by a thick, white haze, obscuring the other shore.)<br />
We headed down for breakfast around 8:00. The buffet was a little different than the night before. Still offering miso soup and soba noodles, the selection also offered fruit, eggs, and a variety of Japanese and western choices. Chris convinced Garth, Jen, and I to try a Japanese plum, which is sour and salty. Garth liked it, but Jen and I found it less palatable.<br />
Mind you, the same division in tastes exists among the Japanese. Like with several things (like natto), they either love it or hate it. Few just accept or tolerate.<br />
Shinichiro and Riko appeared soon after Mr. and Mrs. May appeared. Tony would straggle down a little later, not looking much different than he had the night before. (As Tony put several times, life on Saipan is slow, so as a result, he&#8217;s slow. Take that for what it&#8217;s worth&#8230;)<br />
Jen and I had come prepared for a little excursion down to the beach following breakfast, and took our leave of the others before they had finished. We took a steep set of stairs from an exit on the west side of the hotel down to a service road of some kind, which took us to the hotel&#8217;s driveway, and down to the main road that runs along the coast. Along one side is a cycling path, which guided us down and around the windy coastline.<br />
It took a while to find a break in the dense tropical vegetation that would show us a path down to the beach. The time wasn&#8217;t poorly spent, however, since the walk was warm, and the sounds of songbirds were an absolute delight. But as we came closer to the surf, the rushing of the waves would become the dominant music.<br />
The trail down to the beach was not maintained, formed over years of people trying to get down to the beach from the road. It&#8217;s about 100 feet in elevation, and you need to be a bit of a mountain goat to do it easily. Fortunately, both Jen and I do a lot of hiking, so the trail wasn&#8217;t an issue.<br />
The beach is long &#8212; a couple of kilometres in total length, following the curve from the point to the bulge that the hotel sits on. The beach mostly disappears there, before reforming on the eastern side of the bulge. The section we were on is littered with tetrapods &#8212; concrete forms with four &#8220;legs&#8221; sticking out at 120 angles to each other. They form an interlocking pattern that creates a barrier against beach erosion.<br />
We wandered the beach a little while, taking pictures and enjoying the sound of the waves on the shore. Jen played chicken with the incoming surf, looking for unique shells, while I walked around taking pictures. But we couldn&#8217;t stay long, and soon had to head back to get ready for the wedding.<br />
I ironed out the wrinkles formed from packing my suit (thankfully minimized), showered, and shaved. Jen showered and dressed, then packed up our collective collection o&#8217; crap and headed back down to the lobby. We had to check out prior to the wedding, and put our bags in a holding room for the day.<br />
Tony and I had been drafted to greet incoming guests, having them sign their names, presenting them with drink tickets, and showing them to a waiting area until they were ready for us at the chapel.<br />
Tony and I had a good laugh at this. Here were two gaijin white guys (one of whom knows enough Japanese to be dangerous, the other can say &#8220;hello&#8221;, &#8220;please&#8221;, and &#8220;sushi&#8221;) greeting people who know a couple words of English and telling them what to do. As Tony said several times: &#8220;Better to laugh, &#8216;cuz crying ain&#8217;t gonna do anything for you.&#8221;<br />
At a little after noon, we were directed towards the second floor (one floor below the lobby), and out to the chapel. The chapel is a small building with a tall spire, just slightly separated from the hotel building. (The Irako View Hotel must do a lot of weddings.) The inside was nice, if perhaps a little austere. But it was small, so it didn&#8217;t seem too awkward.<br />
We entered through a door on the north side of the building, and entered the octagonal chapel room. The western three sides had massive windows that overlooked the water and across the bay. (It would make taking pictures a little difficult.) Chris&#8217; family and friends (totalling eight, including Shinichiro, who was doubling as photographer) sat on the left side of the room, while Kaz&#8217;s family and friends (totalling about 30) sat on the right side of the room.<br />
The emcee was one of the hotel&#8217;s employees, who regularly performs this duty (it&#8217;s not hard to tell). She&#8217;s quite good, although her English is a little forced. While a very nice service overall, I was a little perturbed by the woman&#8217;s need to inject a bit of a sales pitch for wedding services at the hotel. Probably normal, though I couldn&#8217;t imagine anyone of us single, English-speaking folk really interested in getting married there.<br />
With Enya playing over the speakers, the doors to the chapel on the east wall opened, and Mrs. May walked in her son to be married. They bowed at the door and entered. It&#8217;s not easy to take pictures when you can&#8217;t see for the tears in your eyes. They walked to the west side of the room, where they faced the audience over a white-draped table. A moment later, Kazumi and her father followed, bowing, and taking their positions next to Chris and his mom. The two parents then left the soon-to-be-newlyweds behind. The last ones through the doors were Kaz&#8217;s nephews (both about three years old), who brought in a small teddy bear with their rings. (As far as I know, the same rings they bought two years ago &#8212; see [[A Surprise Engagement]].)<br />
No-one stood for Chris and Kaz. This is a bit of an odd service, at least by western standards. The emcee guided the audience through the ritual, which went as follows. First, the register was signed by Chris, Kaz, their parents, and then everyone in attendance. This is, I assume, to prove that the civil service was approved by everyone in attendance. Jen was a little confused at first, not sure what she was supposed to do. I just told her to follow what everyone else was doing.<br />
It was a little odd signing the register. I&#8217;ve never signed one before. At the time I was signing it, it was just me putting my name down. But as I rose to leave, Chris said: &#8220;Thanks, Geoff&#8221; That&#8217;s when it hit me. This wasn&#8217;t just a signature. This was an affirmation of the marriage, of Chris&#8217; love for Kaz, and my love for him.<br />
Following the registry signing, they exchanged rings, and exchanged vows, Chris reading in Japanese and Kaz reading in English. The ceremony was short, but simple. The married couple then walked down the aisle. I took pictures that I could not see.<br />
I always seem to cry at weddings.<br />
Once outside, we all engaged in attempts to take pictures of Chris and Kaz, before being directed to a pair of benches so we could take a large group photo. This was nigh-excrutiating, as we were not only looking directly into the sun, but were also subjected with a bright flash. My eyes felt like they were burning out of my head. I hope that my eyes don&#8217;t look too screwed up from trying to keep them open.<br />
After all this, Chris can actually say that I&#8217;ve gone to the ends of the Earth for him.<br />
After the group shots were more photos, done with Shinichiro. We took a barrage of rather confusing instructions and eventually figured out where we were supposed to stand. Finally, we followed Chris and Kaz back into the hotel, and over to the wedding reception room for the family meal (Jen, Tony, Shinichiro, Riko, and I were considered extended family).<br />
The reception was a little odd, being a little more dramatic than I thought it would be. Once we were all seated around the long table, the drapes were drawn over the windows looking out onto the bay, the lights dimmed, and a spotlight put on Chris and Kaz as they entered the room to their place at the head of the table. Then champagne was poured for everyone, and the two fathers read out speeches (Chris translated his father&#8217;s speech for Kaz&#8217;s family).<br />
The drapes were reopened, and the meal began. And what a meal it was! Three dishes awaited us right away: a salad of seaweed and fish egg sacks, a lettuce-based salad, and one other thing I can&#8217;t remember now. Why can&#8217;t I remember? Because that was the first of about 10 rounds of food,including smoked salmon, lobster mousse, lobster with a chili sauce served in a lobster shell cut in half length-wise, sushi, clear soup, noodles, and two or three desserts, including the wedding cake. Garth, Jen, and I couldn&#8217;t believe that the food just kept coming.<br />
Mind you, there really wasn&#8217;t a lot of food, all told. In total, it would have amounted to maybe four large courses at a regular wedding. Still, it was a lot more food than any of us were expecting.<br />
And of course, there was drink. In addition to the champagne, there was beer. Tradition holds that everyone offers to fill the groom&#8217;s glass at least once. After a while, people start going around, filling other&#8217;s glasses. It&#8217;s impossible to tell how much beer one consumes over the course of the meal, but I think it safe to assume that Garth<!--, Jen,--> and I consumed far too much, mostly thanks to Shinichiro.<br />
During a break between rounds, Mrs. May and I talked a bit about the wedding, and she suddenly announced that I was next. Stuart and Therese got married in 2002, and now Chris. That means I&#8217;m the last one. Maybe in 2006&#8230;<br />
After the meal finally ended around 16:00, we headed out to collect our bags (some changed into more comfortable clothes), gathered our bags, and boarded the bus for Toyohashi. We were changing to the Associa Hotel, and then going to a reception party in the city.<br />
The bus ride back took a different route than the one going out, and though a little more direct, seemed to take longer. Tony and Shinichiro slept, and I swear Jen dozed once or twice. But it was a lot quieter on the way back than it had been on the way out.<br />
Back at the hotel, we checked in, hauled our stuff up to our rooms, and then prepared to head out. Jen and I were down first, followed shortly by Garth. Tony was a few minutes behind, wearing the infamous monkey suit.<br />
Yes, Tony has a monkey suit. It&#8217;s a costume he picked up a couple of years ago for a party. He has no qualms about wearing it, even to a large dinner party. He&#8217;s worn it on the plane from Saipan to Narita, and almost wore it on the shinkansen to Toyohashi. Garth convinced him to wear it for the dinner.<br />
A little late leaving (Kaz wanted to hear her wedding dress), we arrived a little late at the Bali-Hai restaurant. Inside waited about 80 or 90 people, only one of whom I knew &#8212; Alex, a friend of ours from Calgary, who&#8217;s teaching English in Nagoya (about 20 minutes by shinkansen).<br />
The dinner was a strange one, featuring several asian dishes I&#8217;d never had before. All quite tasty. We all played bingo, for some reason, which offered prizes to anyone who managed to get five in a row. The closest I got was four. Jen won a shampoo/body wash set, for which she was extremely happy.<br />
And yes, there was drink. Quite a bit of it. Beer, mostly, though Shinichiro had me try so-ju, which Tony described as &#8220;watered-down vodka&#8221;. It tastes a little like mildly alcoholic oolong tea. And of course, there was beer. Lots of beer. Jen couldn&#8217;t stop laughing or giggling.<br />
We had to leave before 21:00, as there was another reservation coming in. We all headed back to the hotel to dump off a few things, dress down a bit, and head out for an izakaya to have a little more fun. We had to wait a while, unfortunately, as Chris and Kaz lost track of time for a while.<br />
This gave Tony and I a bit of time to try to sort out tomorrow&#8217;s shinkansen schedule. Jen and I are heading to Hiroshima, and we need to be in the city by noon. Shinkansen run fairly often, but the trick is to catch the right ones so we don&#8217;t waste too much time. Luckily, the hotel provided paper schedules that we&#8217;ll take with us.<br />
Finally, around 23:00, Tony, Jen, Garth, Chris, Kaz, Shinichiro, Riko, and I gathered to go to the izakaya. An izakaya is a Japanese public house, where people get together for a lot of loud talking, heavy drinking, and a little bit of food. The place, called Fuku, was already full when we arrived, but they managed to clear some space for us.<br />
And yes, more drinking. Garth and I split warm sake, but the real surprise was Jen. Cold sake. A full bottle, all to herself. And about half of the second warm bottle, too. Her parents are gonna kill me. Surprisingly enough, she wasn&#8217;t too bad off, something I&#8217;ll attribute to body mass and metabolism.<br />
Although we were not privy to most conversations (Chris is quite capable of holding his own when talking with others; Garth, Jen, and I talked amongst ourselves or with Shinichiro and Riku), we were periodically brought in by Chris when something interesting was raised. Such was the case when he suddenly told Jen and I to stand up. We did. (We assumed, correctly, that this was to compare heights.) Chris then asked those sitting near him how old they thought Jen was.<br />
One said 28, another 27, and another would only go so far as &#8220;late-20s&#8221;. Chris then asked Jen to tell them how old she really is. She privately asked Chris first how to say her age in Japanese, which she then repeated to the three men. Their jaws dropped when they found out she&#8217;s only 15.<br />
Last call came, and we all headed out into the cool night air to return to the hotel. Jen had a new souvenir, a &#8220;gift&#8221; from Shinichiro &#8212; one of the two warm sake serving bottles. Doesn&#8217;t matter what country you&#8217;re in, people like to take stuff from restaurants.<br />
Jen and I need sleep. Tomorrow is going to be another longish day.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fourteen days, and counting.<br />
Two weeks from today, I&#8217;m off to Japan. Again. Relax, this isn&#8217;t going to turn into a yearly thing. If I&#8217;d had a choice, I&#8217;d probably be going to Australia this year, maybe New Zealand. But I&#8217;ve got a good reason for going back to Japan.<br />
<span id="more-332"></span>Chris is getting married. Of course, you already knew that (see [[A Surprise Engagement]]). It was just a question of when and where. I&#8217;d been suggesting Hawaii, partly because it was (roughly) half-way between Japan and North America, but also because I&#8217;d never been there.<br />
But it ain&#8217;t my wedding. It&#8217;s going to be held in Toyohashi (about two hours south-west of Tokyo by shinkansen). So Down Under will have to wait for another time. For my closest friends, I&#8217;ll gladly travel halfway around the world.<br />
Last time I was in Japan (see [[My Trip to Japan, Calgary to Yotsukaido]]), I spent most of my time in the Tokyo area. This time, I want to see more of the country. The furthest away I got was Shizoika, which was in an effort to see Mount Fuji (see [[My Trip to Japan, Shinkansen to Mount Fuji]]). This time, I&#8217;m going all the way down to Hiroshima, then working my way back up to Tokyo, and even north to Nikko.<br />
But I won&#8217;t be travelling alone. Back in October, I gained a travel partner. This came about from a discussion we were having over dinner at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s, celebrating Nana&#8217;s six-month anniversary at being in Calgary. Most of my family knows Chris quite well, and were asking about Chris&#8217; then-recently-announced wedding. What was the date? What were the plans? Was I going?<br />
When I replied that I was going back (wouldn&#8217;t pass it up for anything), a voice suddenly chirped up: &#8220;Can I come?&#8221; It was Jen, my cousin (Uncle Mike and Aunt Brenda&#8217;s sole child). She had a giant, hopeful smile. For a brief moment, I thought against her coming along &#8212; I kind of wanted to travel solo. But then I realized that having a person to travel with would be a lot more fun.<br />
&#8220;Sure! Why not?&#8221;<br />
The look on Mike and Brenda&#8217;s faces was priceless.<br />
Needless to say, there were monetary issues to resolve before Jen could actually be allowed to go. My family is, if nothing else, very supportive. Nana chipped in for a sizable portion of Jen&#8217;s costs, her parents covering the rest. But by the time Jen&#8217;s 15th birthday rolled around in November, it was a done deal. Jen was going to Japan.<br />
We leave 25 March, going through Vancouver. Jen and I will be seated side-by-side the whole way out and back. (Heck, for over two weeks, we&#8217;ll be tied at the hip.) We arrive 26 March (owing to the International Date Line) and begin our little adventure.<br />
This adventure, unlike my previous one, needs a little planning. For example, we had to get Jen familiar with Japanese food. She&#8217;s going to be eating nothing but for two weeks. Then there&#8217;s the need for footwear. My shoes would not survive two weeks&#8217; of walking about.<br />
This is what I did last Saturday. I hadn&#8217;t really even thought about until I almost absent-mindedly walked into the R &#8216;n R store next to Sumo Sushi in Eau Claire Market. The odd little squeak emanating from my old shoes was enough to irk me into new shoes. The need for walking shoes, combined with a desire for something I can hike in, led me to a long afternoon of shoe shopping.<br />
Hey, when you&#8217;re going to spend $120 on a pair of shoes, you make sure you&#8217;re buying something that meets your needs.<br />
The next step of planning is the list of destinations and activities. I tasked Jen to pick out all the places she wanted to see in Japan, with the caveat that we wouldn&#8217;t likely be able to see it all. Far easier to whittle things down than it is to find more things to see and do. Her list was lengthy, but well thought out.<br />
I started looking at the lists on Sunday night. The list was long and organized by prefecture (the Japanese equivalent of a province or state), so while it wasn&#8217;t too hard to figure out where approximately Jen wanted to go, it wasn&#8217;t particularly obvious how easy it would be.<br />
Using a rather nice map from japanrailpass.net, I plotted out the key areas in the list on Monday night. Much to my delight, about 80% of them were on the shinkansen lines. This made them easy to get to. (There were a few that were quite some distance away, on what I can only assume are the much slower local lines.)<br />
Tuesday ended up being a complete waste of a day at the office. There was no work to be had at all. Luckily, this gave me a chance to sit down with the lists and the map, and try to figure out how the heck we were going to spending all of our time in Japan.<br />
I was delighted yet again to find that a first run-through of an itinerary produced something that not only covered a lot of ground but allowed us to attend the major events without difficulty. It&#8217;s a little tight in a couple of places (we&#8217;re spending only one day in Kyoto, for example), but has some flexibility if we want to play with things a bit.<br />
Well, at least that&#8217;s what I want myself to believe. This morning, Chris called me on the draft itinerary, saying: &#8220;You are out of your fucking tree.&#8221; While I had been fairly proud of the itinerary, there was a reason I&#8217;d CC&#8217;d Chris when I sent it out to Jen and Aunt Brenda. I needed a sanity check.<br />
Reality: Two weeks to experience a slice of Japan. Now, it&#8217;s possible to do the itinerary in two weeks. That doesn&#8217;t make it a good idea. We&#8217;d literally be spending hours in some places before going onto the next. As Chris so wisely pointed out, there&#8217;s no time to experience anything. Jen and I will be in parts of Japan even Chris hasn&#8217;t been to (some he hasn&#8217;t even heard of). If we&#8217;re going to actually *experience* something, then perhaps we need to slow down.<br />
Two weeks. I haven&#8217;t been looking this forward to a trip in a long time. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting one, to be sure. I just hope there&#8217;s enough time to finish planning before we leave.<br />
&#8216;Cuz there won&#8217;t be any time once we get there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere, in a long-forgotten book in some dusty corner of a decrepit building in a burned out city, there is a sentence that says vacations are supposed to be restful. And someone is going to a lot of trouble to make sure I can&#8217;t find that sentence.<br />
Last week, starting very early on 3 August, I flew to Ontario. As luck would have it, I was on the same red-eye flight with my cousin Pam and her beau, Sean. Normally, this would be reason for celebration, but flying red-eye basically means you sleep the whole way. And believe me, sleeping is far easier with leather seats.<br />
Yes, leather. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten into WestJet, but at least one of their planes has leather seats. Not just one. Not just a few. All of the seats. The only downer: The ones backing onto the emergency exit rows don&#8217;t recline. (I found out the hard way.)<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering what I was doing on a red-eye flight given my dislike for them (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), but it came down to an issue of price. Red-eyes are cheap. And with leather seats, I might be doing more red-eyes in the future.<br />
This was the first time I flew into Pearson on WestJet, and I reminded myself yet again why I hate that airport. It&#8217;s too slow. Cathy was circling for over 20 minutes before hearing from me. I told her to park &#8212; I was going to be a while longer.<br />
Bags in hand, Cathy and I headed to Oakville. Pam and Sean disappeared to Stratford. We wouldn&#8217;t see them again until the following Friday. Arriving home, my mother welcomed me at the door, and I made a beeline for the bed.<br />
Leather seats or not, I didn&#8217;t get enough sleep.<br />
The Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were filled with various wedding-related tasks, not the least of which was picking things up, dropping things off, and getting things organized. (Yeah, real vague, I know, but I&#8217;d be writing an entire log entry just on that stuff alone.)<br />
Oh, whose wedding, you ask? I&#8217;ll give you a hint: Not mine.<br />
After a long wait, my sister&#8217;s beau, Craig, finally proposed to her on Christmas morning (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), making not only Cathy very happy, but the rest of my family as well. And after almost eight long months of waiting, it was time for the happy day to arrive.<br />
I had originally come out to Ontario a week in advance to help out with all the little last-minute details that I expected would crop up. But unbeknownst to me, events would transpire that would change the course of my week.<br />
Details on that in a following log, of course.<br />
Suffice to say, come Tuesday, I was no longer in Oakville. Instead, I spent a lot of time at the CBC head office on Front Street (see [[Working at CBC Headquarters in Toronto]]), working for my friend Brenda. That sucked up pretty much every spare second I had for four days, although I did manage to leave at a somewhat &#8220;respectable&#8221; hour on Thursday to return home for dinner (the family invasion formally began that evening) and early on Friday (for obvious reasons).<br />
But even on Saturday morning, we didn&#8217;t get a chance to slow down. It was go-go-go from the moment my alarm went off at 8:00am. The first task for me was to get Craig and Dave (Craig&#8217;s best man) over to the barber so we could get our haircut. (Mine was looking something like a floor mop.)<br />
Craig and Dave were the first ones up, disposing of their excess locks. Completed, they disappeared off to Craig and Cathy&#8217;s house to await orders. My turn. So in addition to looking respectable again (yeah, tough as that might sound), I also had a shave. A real one. With a straight razor. Luckily, Sandy is one of the best barbers in Ontario; certainly the best I&#8217;ve ever had. I had complete faith in him not to slice something off.<br />
I should point out that I&#8217;ve never had a shave with anything but an electric razor. So my skin is quite sensitive. Sandy had to shave me twice to prevent slicing me open. But he did a good job &#8212; even by 11pm, I hadn&#8217;t grown much of a beard back, and I grow fast.<br />
Following the shave was some chores around the house &#8212; mostly moving things. (Aunt Ruth was madly preparing flowers, which needed placing; Aunt Karen brought a light trellis that needed assembling; and flowers all over the place needed watering.) And somewhere in all that, I ran to the grocery store to stock up on almost $80 in Clamato and orange juice.<br />
After a quick bolt through the shower, I rode over to pick up Craig and Dave. They were dressed in their finest, ready for the show. I piled them into the minivan, and hauled them back to the Sowrey homestead. People had started to arrive, though it was mostly family. But you could hear the Great Engine beginning to turn over&#8230;<br />
Inside, people were officially going crazy. Mom was getting dressed, Cathy was talking with everyone, the caterers were running around &#8230; I almost felt like I was in a Keystone Cops short. But it was time for myself to get dressed. Unlike Craig and Dave, though, I would not be wearing a tux. Cathy had made one request: Wear Dad&#8217;s kilt.<br />
When Dad had been diagnosed with brain cancer, he had been told he had a year to live. All he wanted to know was if he would live to see his daughter&#8217;s wedding. When he passed away in March, there was a hole that needed filling.<br />
Instead of Dad, it would be I who would walk Cathy down the aisle. And she was only walking down it if there was someone next to her wearing Dad&#8217;s kilt. Luckily for me, it fit, albeit a little tight and very warm in that mid-August heat.<br />
Oh, and in case you&#8217;re wondering, I did not wear it regimental style. (That means sans undergarments.) Why? Well, originally I was, but then I remembered all the troublemakers C&amp;C had invited to the party, and suddenly I wasn&#8217;t really filled with a great deal of confidence about their abilities to remain mature. (I was right, too. Cathy&#8217;s boss shoved one of the disposable cameras under my kilt while we were engaged in group photos.)<br />
The minister arrived and gave the &#8220;pep&#8221; talks with Craig and Cathy (independently &#8212; Cathy forbade Craig to see her prior to the ceremony). There was no practice ceremony &#8212; C&amp;C (as we in the family refer to them) like flying by the seat of their pants.<br />
After running around for about 20 minutes, Cathy finally pronounced she was ready. The minister pronounced he was ready. (I don&#8217;t think Craig had a choice.) It was time. The music was cued, and Cathy went out the front door.<br />
The guests waited in the backyard. Cathy, Julie, and I walked to the side. Julie took a deep breath, and then walked through the gate to the snapping of shutters. We&#8217;d been told to give Julie lots of room before coming in. Dramatic pause, dawdling, psychological torture, call it what you will. Right up until we started walking in, arm in arm, Cathy had been cool and collected. The second we rounded that corner, she couldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
I felt a little guilty. This was Cathy&#8217;s big day, and I was sharing the limelight with her. At first, I was just walking my sister. But after a few moments, it suddenly became real. Like someone had wiped the fog from the bathroom mirror. To say the feeling was overwhelming is like suggesting a hurricane is a light breeze. It took everything I had not to cry.<br />
Once Cathy was next to Craig, the ceremony started to take shape, and things went quickly. True to their word, it lasted only 20 minutes before the legalities were over, and the new Mr. and Mrs. were presented to the assembly. Many pictures ensued.<br />
After they ceremoniously walked out as husband and wife (returning after a few photos on the front lawn), came the toast to the couple. Huntsville Dave would be the speaker, a neighbour of C&amp;C at their cottage. He, like the rest of the ceremony, spoke without a script, and without a clue about what he was going to say before it was said.<br />
(A note on Daves. C&amp;C seem to know a lot of them. Too many, as a matter of fact. So many, that they all have qualifiers, usually denoting where they live: Huntsville, Scarborough, Ainsville, Oakville, and so forth.)<br />
As the speech finished, I quickly ducked inside to take off the jacket to the kilt. Although I would later learn that it is customary to keep your jacket on until the groom removes his, I was wearing something designed for winter conditions. With all due deference to my new brother-in-law, I was dying in that thing.<br />
Shortly after, we gathered the families, and went for the photographs. Cameras were everywhere. We were lucky that it was bright enough that most didn&#8217;t use flashes. I can only imagine the bright spots I would have seen.<br />
While this was going on, the catering staff had opened the bar, and people not taking pictures (or being in them) had started to mingle. Hors d&#8217;oeurves were shortly followed, and quickly eaten. There was laughter, music, food, and drink. No-one, as far as I can tell, had a bad time.<br />
The finger foods soon gave way to more &#8220;formal&#8221; foods: seafood (raw oysters, lox, shrimp), sushi, and roast beef on a bun. Yeah, doesn&#8217;t sound too fancy, but then the food should fit the couple. (I&#8217;m not saying C&amp;C aren&#8217;t fancy, but they&#8217;re not pretentious.) And for the record, I&#8217;ve never had buffet-style roast beef that good before.<br />
After a while, the speeches started. Cathy had hit upon the idea of using an old family gong to get people&#8217;s attention when words were to be said, and people to expect a kiss from the bride and groom. The first few were tame (even with a rather emotional speech from Cathy&#8217;s boss), but they got more interesting as the evening wore on.<br />
The one that really surprised us was Julie&#8217;s husband, Dave. He&#8217;s a great guy, just not usually talkative. We were floored when he got up in front of 90-odd people to extol the virtues of his friends. (We were even more floored with his impassioned interpretation of the Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; later on.)<br />
And somewhere in there, was my speech. But this wasn&#8217;t to C&amp;C, it was on behalf of the family to everyone else. It was thanks for the effort and trouble people had to go through to come, some from as far as Anguilla and Vancouver. (Even Gerry and Sam dropped in for a while, who live in Bermuda. Although they were in the area for other reasons.) When it came time to end my speech, I needed a something interesting, funny, and appropriate. So naturally, I drew a blank.<br />
I think that&#8217;s when Dad stepped in. Before I knew it, this is what I&#8217;d said:<br />
&#8220;And if you should find that something is missing here tonight, please do not hesitate to let us know. We&#8217;ll make sure that you get so drunk that you won&#8217;t remember.&#8221;<br />
Dad had definitely made it to the wedding.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before it was time for the first dance. Craig used to teach dance at Arthur Murray, so we all expected quite a show. Unfortunately, he hadn&#8217;t had a chance to teach Cathy yet. But it was still something out of a fairy tale to watch.<br />
Following the dance, it was time to dance with the parents. I was to fill in for Dad. However, we had a slight change in plans, when Don stepped instead. Don is virtually a surrogate father for Cathy and I &#8212; we&#8217;ve known him that long. I think Cathy was a little concerned that I felt pushed out in favour of Don, but I think there was no better person for the job.<br />
Besides, I can&#8217;t dance.<br />
Admittedly, the rest of the evening gets a little hazy from there. About 11:00 or so, I made the mistake of switching from beer to wine, although I don&#8217;t know why. So come about 2:00am, I was apparently incapable of independent vertical alignment, nor could annunciate baby gibberish, let alone a coherent sentence. And I would pay dearly for it the next morning.<br />
Which began at about 10:00am. We had to get ready for the lunch with family, as many of them would be taking off for home again. This also gave C&amp;C time to unwrap the presents they received the night before.<br />
The barbecue billowed smoke from all the hamburgers, the pot boiled corn, and we ate to our hearts&#8217; content. It was a good day, following a great night. And the hilarity around the presents made it even better.<br />
The single best one, in my opinion, was from the Navis family, an old family friend. They gave C&amp;C a poem, on which was a series of instructions on how to build a fence. Each step corresponded to a numbered envelope, which contained a series of gift certificates representative of that step (e.g. coffee, wood, beer, and dinner). And to top it off, his and her hammers and pint beer mugs.<br />
That night, we sat in the back yard, and listened to the crickets, the wind through the trees, and the complete lack of any semblance of traffic or other noises. As Don, another old family friend remarked, it was the end of an era. His era was the end of comfortable backyards. Mine was different. It was the end of the neighbourhood as I knew it. It would be the last night for me next to the pool. The last meal was Chinese. The last swim had been with my cousin, Jen. It would be the last night I slept in the house that I was raised in.<br />
But no amount of sombreness would diminish the happiness of the previous days&#8217; events. The wedding had been more than Cathy could have dreamed for. She and Craig were now readying for a week at their cottage to spend some much needed time relaxing. We would all be happy with the way things went, and with the way things would go.<br />
Even with the killer hangover that I think I&#8217;ve still got.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I left Vancouver nearly six months ago. At once, it feels like a lifetime ago, and it feels like yesterday. During the past six months, I have sat at my desk, on my couch, or laid in bed wondering what might have been had I not left. Today, the answer is clear.<br />
Today, had I not run for, and away from my life, I would be a married man. Today was my wedding day.<br />
I can stand (were I not at my desk working) and say with confidence that I made the right decision &#8230; for me, that is. You might wonder if I feel any regret or remorse for what I did six months ago. To a degree, yes, I do. I ruined the hopes and dreams of a human being, regardless of what she did to me. Today, she is thinking about what might have been. But I am not thinking of her.<br />
I am thinking of me. I am thinking that I haven&#8217;t been this free and happy in over two and a half years. I have been responsible for my own choices, my own decisions, and my own mistakes. I am happy with who I have become, and with who I am.<br />
Weddings are supposed to be one of the happiest days in someone&#8217;s life. Many of my friends (nearly all of my university friends) are now married. I think I am one of a very small handful who are not. I have only been to two weddings so far &#8212; that of a co-worker, and I was dragged to the other. I missed two weddings I was invited to because of financial reasons. I missed seeing these happy days.<br />
Yet as I sit here and type, I cannot imagine a happier day for myself. I wake up each and every day and am thankful for what I did. Yes, these past couple of weeks have been very difficult on myself, with tight deadlines and a heavy workload, but even though I might gripe about my workload, I am truly happy. I would hope everyone can feel at least as much joy as I do, for it is truly exhilarating.<br />
Today is also the wedding day of one of my former colleagues at Radical Entertainment &#8230; of one of my friends. Right now, she is probably in Quebec, saying her vows to her long-time partner. (This is more speculation, as plans change and I haven&#8217;t spoken to her since I left. Not to mention that I don&#8217;t know what time the ceremony is supposed to be.) For them, I raise my cup in toast. (I hope you don&#8217;t mind warm, stale Coke &#8212; it&#8217;s all I have at the moment.)<br />
Today used to be a date I dreaded would one day come. But it came without fanfare, and it would have come without notice, had I chosen not to say something. It is an ordinary day, like any other. And I will revel in it, just as I have every other ordinary day, because there is nothing more special than happiness.</p>
