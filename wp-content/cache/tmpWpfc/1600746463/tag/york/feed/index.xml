										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently out in the United Kingdom on vacation. If you know <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/category/travel/">my travel habits</a>, you know I rarely stay in one place for long &#8212; I like to move around. (Yes, this often fuels or is fueled by <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/category/trains/">my mild obsession with trains</a>.) It means that I often pay close attention to public transit, and how it operates.<br />
While we were in York, a thought suddenly hit me. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d seen this elsewhere, but it hadn&#8217;t really registered. The buses weren&#8217;t run by York Transit, or Transit Yorkshire, or anything directly related to the city/region government. The buses were privatized through <a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/">FirstGroup PLC</a>.<br />
And suddenly I thought: Why couldn&#8217;t Calgary do the same?<br />
<span id="more-962"></span>Let&#8217;s do a quick comparison, though. (To be fair.)</p>

</table>
<p>* I&#8217;m not taking exchange rates into account, since CDN$1 in Canada has about the same buying power of  Â£1 in the UK.<br />
Now, to prevent myself getting into a really deep hole, let me preface the next part of my argument with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not know what subsidies, if any, <a href="http://www.firstgroup.com/ukbus/yorkhumber/york/home/">First York</a> (the division of FirstGroup PLC that runs the bus system in York) receives</li>
<li>Differences between Calgary and York do not scale consistently (e.g. ~5 times for population, ~3 times for area, ~8 times for bus routes)</li>
<li>York thrives off of tourism, whereas oil rules here in Calgary, which places public transit as a bigger priority in York</li>
<li>York has a large and busy train station; Calgary has long since forgotten what a train is</li>
<li>Privatized public transit is virtually unknown in North America (most are government-owned, or heavily government-subsidized)</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be also pointed out that while York is a much smaller city with smaller problems, Hong Kong has multiple competing privatized systems. Those tend to work very well.<br />
Alright, all that said&#8230;<br />
The cost of running a transportation system &#8212; including public transit &#8212; is rarely straight-forward. Equipment (airplanes, trains, buses, ferries, taxis, support vehicles ad nauseum) and its upkeep, facilities (stations, maintenance buildings), ticketing and billing, training, administrative support, and so forth adds up. It ain&#8217;t cheap. And in most cases, run by the wrong institutions &#8212; governments.<br />
Everyone likes to point out that governments are wasteful. They&#8217;re bureaucratic, slow to adapt (and often do not receive pressure to adapt), and as a result become very insulative such that those who can make the decisions never really get feedback from the users (e.g. passengers) to make a significant difference.<br />
Don&#8217;t believe me? Allow me to quote some particularly stellar examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swissair">Swissair</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitalia#Financial_situation">Alitalia</a> (not gone yet, but just wait&#8230;)</li>
<li>Air Canada (multiple <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2003/03/31/aircanaid030331.html">bailouts</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak#Controversy">Amtrak</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Given, these are mostly airlines, and the ones that have tended to make headlines in one way or another. All of them suffer from the same problem &#8212; governments can&#8217;t run businesses. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway#Privatization">CN Rail</a>, as a near-perfect example, has been a very profitable company since it went private. (Given, it&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Railway#Recent_controversies">safety record has been abysmal</a> in the last few years. That&#8217;s another post.)<br />
Calgary Transit is on a much smaller scale &#8212; it has but one city to contend with. But the administration of Calgary Transit bubbles up to the same person responsible for roads. That, my friends, is a conflict of interest. (Or at least, conflicting priorities.) You can imagine that he gets more people yelling at him about the state of the roads than he does about bus schedules.<br />
So move Calgary Transit away from the <a href="http://www.calgary.ca/">City</a>. Tender out the operation to another company. Sell off the assets (think of the taxes the city might earn from this), and let them negotiate with the city for things like bus lanes, dedicated spaces, etc. Remove the employment from the City and put it under private ownership, where it would hopefully be dealt with in a more business-like manner than the current &#8220;whenever&#8221; approach that there seems to be now.<br />
Yes, there are a thousand reasons this might not work. There are also a thousand reasons that it might. And frankly, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2006/08/15/calgary-transit-sucks/">I&#8217;m not convinced</a> that the City of Calgary is putting in the effort to run a public transportation network properly or efficiently &#8212; and <a href="http://www.screwcalgarytransit.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=27&amp;func=view&amp;id=41&amp;catid=4">I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks that</a>, either.<br />
So who could run this? How about <a href="http://www.firstgroupamerica.com/">FirstGroup America</a>? Yep, they&#8217;re already here. Laidlaw buses? That&#8217;s them. They also own one of the largest bus lines in North America &#8212; <a href="http://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound</a>. So it&#8217;s not like they don&#8217;t have any knowledge and/or experience. But wait, it gets better! Under their <a href="http://www.firsttransit.com/">FirstTransit</a> moniker, they run <a href="http://www.firsttransit.com/services_fixedTMC.php">routes all over the 50 States</a>. That&#8217;s street cred, in my book.<br />
With the constant rise (and likely to keep rising) of oil prices, it will become more prohibitive to drive personal automobiles. We need effective public transit in Calgary now, and we need it effective before we have a meltdown (and I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re far off).<br />
Privatize. Before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the few minutes I have before I dive back into another conference session, figured I&#8217;d cover some of the items of our last vacation. This was a 2.5 week excursion mostly to Scotland, with a few days in England. Alex planned most of the trip, with me handling things like the transportation and hotels to stay along the way. Overall, about a 50/50 split on the events et al.<br />
Sadly, at the end, it wasn&#8217;t a usual vacation. Until now, it&#8217;s always been either just me, or myself and Alex. Now there&#8217;s three of us, and the Wee One doesn&#8217;t have our stamina for travel and has a pseudo-schedule that needs to be followed from time-to-time.<br />
<span id="more-928"></span></p>
<h4>British Airways</h4>
<p>We flew BA from Calgary to London (via Heathrow). Air Canada &#8212; are you listening? These are the guys you should be looking to for level of service. Wow. Allow me to describe: We arrive at the plane along the jetway, with stroller (and babe) in hand. They tell us that they might not be able to bring the stroller on-board, but they&#8217;d let us know. They didn&#8217;t ask for seat or name &#8212; they figured it out on their own, checked the stroller, and gave us the claim ticket. They presented us with a small toy bag for the Wee One with a small stuffed plane for playtime. Free wine. Good (read: real) food. A feeling like people actually cared about the passengers&#8217; well-being. Excellent in-flight entertainment for that 8-9 flight. Sure, it costs a bit extra. But not so much that I wouldn&#8217;t even think twice about flying with them again &#8212; that&#8217;s a definite.</p>
<h4>Travelling with the Wee One</h4>
<p>Most people thought we were nuts for hauling our offspring to Europe. A seven hour time difference, air travel, trains, ferries, lots of packing and moving, and add an infant to all of that?<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2007/11/24/we-have-a-travel-safe-baby/">I said it before</a>, but our kid rocks. Sleep on the flight out (sadly, not so much on the way back), adjustment to the timezone in two nights (by the third day, all was well), played a lot on the trains (although she did have trouble sleeping due to lack of space), and she didn&#8217;t keep us up at night even though we were all in the same room. It didn&#8217;t matter how many places we went or how many people wanted to hold her (the Wee One apparently is the cutest thing many Brits have ever seen, judging by the near-endless stream of comments we got).<br />
And hey, I got to spend 2.5 of constant time with my child! What on Earth could be wrong with that?<br />
About the only bad thing (if you could call it that) was one bad habit picked up by a three-week older infant, and now the raspberry has entered the vocabulary.</p>
<h4>Iona and the Iona Community</h4>
<p>This was our first stop. Iona is a small island off the coast of the Isle of Mull, which is in turn off the western coast of Scotland. (The nearest major port is Oban, in case you&#8217;re looking for a geographical reference.) The day we arrived, there was a viciously strong and cold north wind. We immediately regretted having arrived, but pressed on. The Community itself runs mostly out of the Iona Abbey, which is owned and operated by Historical Scotland. For a week, we were guests, and basically had free run of the place.<br />
That said, a week at a Christian commune (even an ecumenical one) takes a bit of a toll on the less- (or non-)devout. Although the people were wonderful &#8212; and I have to say that while I lamented the absence of meat in our meals, the things they can do with vegetables are stunning &#8212; I was happy to be on the road again for the mainland.<br />
It&#8217;s a very small island, so it&#8217;s (relatively) easy to get around on it. Though parts of it are very boggy, you can cross the island in about 30 minutes, and go the length in about three times that. Even the highest point on the island &#8212; Dun I &#8212; takes about 15 minutes to climb, if you take your time.<br />
It&#8217;s quiet, and it&#8217;s very dark at night &#8212; there are almost no street lights. It&#8217;s so quiet that doors mostly don&#8217;t have locks. The Abbey (technically-speaking) is open all the time.</p>
<h4>Oban</h4>
<p>I heard a few people trash Oban before I went there. But I have to say it&#8217;s a nice little town. It&#8217;s a good base for day trips, and there&#8217;s a lot to see in the area. You could easily stay there a week and not be bored. Given, the hotel we stayed at (Oban Caledonian) had some trouble &#8212; when you have to name the springs in your mattress due to the intimacy you&#8217;re getting with them, it&#8217;s time to replace the mattress. But I&#8217;ve stayed in far, far worse for much more money.</p>
<h4>Train Travel</h4>
<p>I love trains. Duh. You know that. So travelling all over the place on trains is generally not a problem. But I gotta say, someone has to change the rules that puts an end to the drunken football hooligans from spreading out all over the car, singing their songs and disturbing the crap out of everyone else, stinking the place up with their booze, and generally being belligerent. No, asshole, I&#8217;m not student. Unlike you, I have the good sense to travel responsibly, but there&#8217;s not enough luggage racks in the car for my backpack. That doesn&#8217;t give you the right to use it as a pillow or a reason to tell me off. (I also have the good sense to not say anything, since I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re looking for a reason to get into a fight.)</p>
<h4>Inverness</h4>
<p>I also had people tell me not to go to Inverness. Why, I have no idea. It&#8217;s a beautiful little city. The trip there north of Perth is gorgeous, with all the rolling hills. It&#8217;s the highlands there, and it&#8217;s the best way to see it all. Anyway, the city of Inverness is amazing. The River Ness seems almost Disney-esque in the way it cleanly cuts through town, with banks of green grass and the sprouting daffodils. Add to that the lovely old buildings, winding little roads, and the general hospitality of people (drunken football hooligans notwithstanding), you just can&#8217;t go wrong.</p>
<h4>Ramada Inverness</h4>
<p>Except for the Ramada Inverness. For the record, the location is excellent. But overall, I found their staff to be bordering on incompetent. There were a couple of shining stars, no question, but I kept running into people who couldn&#8217;t answer the most basic questions, such as telling me why I can&#8217;t make a long distance phone call. It drove me CRAZY. So sorry, Mom, I couldn&#8217;t call you on your birthday. I tried, really.</p>
<h4>High Tea at the Edinburgh Hilton Caledonian</h4>
<p>Just as good as we had the last time we were there. Outstanding service. Great food. Great tea. Just wish we could have been there longer. Such is life.</p>
<h4>York</h4>
<p>I finally got to spend some actual time in York. The last time we were there barely 5 hours, so didn&#8217;t see much of it. That said, I didn&#8217;t really understand the road map until well into the second day (I kept getting turned around) and even then still took wrong turns. Confusing, but I still love the place. I could easily do month-long stints there to do some photo essays: York at Night, York Minster&#8217;s Hidden Places, Up Close with the National Rail Museum, etc. Love it.</p>
<h4>York to St. Albans without going to London</h4>
<p>Big mistake. Too many switches, we missed a connection, and it&#8217;s too much movement. Going through London is out of the way, but it&#8217;s a lot easier.</p>
<h4>St. Albans</h4>
<p>I still love this little place. The last time, we swore we&#8217;d spend more time there the next time. But we ended up with not even 1 day again, sadly. One day, we will spend more time there. It&#8217;s a very nice place.</p>
<h4>Pictures</h4>
<p>Some are already <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/tags/scotland2008/">posted on Flickr</a>, and others will come once I get them all done.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I love travelling &#8212; I honestly believe that I don&#8217;t do enough of it.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love travelling &#8212; I honestly believe that I don&#8217;t do enough of it. Always makes me feel more energised, and sitting on my duff all day long really makes me pine for it.<br />
So I&#8217;m lucky to be getting around a bit in the next few months.<br />
<span id="more-894"></span>First, the family is off to Scotland again. This time, more Scotland than England. And no Ireland. Allen and Alex want to visit Iona. A week on a small rural island with ancient churches. I can&#8217;t think of a better place for a photo essay, myself. Then off to the Inverness area (hello, Nessie!), through York for a couple of days (a <em>whole day</em> in the National Railway Museum!), then home again. That&#8217;ll be early April.<br />
And, yes, El Bebe is coming with us. Not sure how this is going to work &#8212; both Alex and I are a bit apprehensive about the time difference. Alex has trouble with the shift &#8212; I can only imagine how the wee one will handle it. We&#8217;ve heard that this is the best time to travel with children, so they (kind of) get used to it. But it does mean we can&#8217;t move at my preferred break-neck pace. Instead of going right to Iona, it&#8217;s going to take two days from the time we land. I can hack that, though.<br />
Next up is a business trip to Chicago, which is actually first in the list, coming up in the second week of February. The Technology Department leadership (which includes me) will be trying to figure out our long-term plans and aspirations. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting session.<br />
Finally &#8212; at least currently on the radar &#8212; is a weekend in Las Vegas. I&#8217;m going down for Tamara&#8217;s wedding. That&#8217;s the second weekend in March. I haven&#8217;t been there in 12 years, so this should make for an interesting experience.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to get back on the road again!</p>
