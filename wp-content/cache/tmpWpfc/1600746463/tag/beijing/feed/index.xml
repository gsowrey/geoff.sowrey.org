										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was skipping through my various feeds this morning, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2518676/Beijing-Olympics-George-Bush-calls-on-China-to-improve-human-rights-record.html">I came across the following quote</a> from Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said the Games would &#8220;help the world to understand China, and it will also help China to understand the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we need to send a team into the IOC&#8217;s fantasy world and extract them, because they&#8217;ve clearly (and totally) misunderstood the situation.<br />
<span id="more-1029"></span>I have two fundamental issues with that quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>The world will not understand China</li>
<li>China has no interest in understanding the world</li>
</ol>
<p>Why won&#8217;t the world understand China? Because the world doesn&#8217;t want to. China is the world&#8217;s   (current) longest-standing culture. Over 5,000 years of history &#8230; a lot of it engaged in conflicts. Not so much war with others, but mostly with themselves. That&#8217;s 5,000 years of political instability, dictatorships (the Emperors weren&#8217;t exactly the nicest of people), insurrections, and various foreign invasions (Mongols, British, and Japanese, to name but a few).<br />
In a country with 1.3 billion people (70% of whom are rural farmers) and a very long history of political upheaval, you can&#8217;t really blame the so-called Communist Party (by textbook definition, China isn&#8217;t communist, nor has there ever been a truly communist government) for being so strong-armed. It could be even viewed (on an optimistic level) that this is more about ensuring the stability of China as a nation than it is about political power.<br />
If you were being optimistic. I could go pessimistic, but that&#8217;s another post&#8230;<br />
Here&#8217;s the problem, though: The world wishes to impose its political views on China. The world wants China to be democratic. The world wants China to end its human rights abuses. <em>The world wants China to change.</em> This isn&#8217;t an act of understanding. This is the world pointing it&#8217;s finger at China.<br />
China, on the other hand, is sort of like a bull. It&#8217;s a big, heavy animal that pretty much does what it wants, when it wants. Everyone needs that bull for various things (bulls are handy things to have on the global ranch), but if you ask that bull to do something it doesn&#8217;t want to do, it&#8217;s not going to do it. It doesn&#8217;t need to, and it&#8217;s quite content to stay the way it is.<br />
More importantly, China doesn&#8217;t want to take direction from outsiders. It has its own view of what it needs to survive, and the views of the rest of the world don&#8217;t really matter. Why? Because even with everything &#8220;bad&#8221; that China does, everyone still buys &#8220;Made In China&#8221; because it&#8217;s cheaper than buying it elsewhere. The money keeps coming, so China has no need to change. (Ain&#8217;t greed grand?)<br />
Hence, there is no need for China to understand the world. Ergo, it won&#8217;t.<br />
So, a note to the IOC: I dunno where the heck you people have been for the last decade, but you really shouldn&#8217;t be surprised with the situation you&#8217;re walking into. China is effectively third-world in terms of its industrialisation, political system, environmental controls, and judicial process. Their economy makes them damn near the most powerful country on Earth (they own a seriously large chunk of the United States&#8217; debt). Hence all the pollution, lack of access to free information, and all their reasons to crack down on perceived freedoms.<br />
Expect protests and expect problems. The Olympics in Beijing have only just started, but you should expect that you&#8217;ll be hearing about these for years to come.<br />
(Incidentally, if my blog isn&#8217;t already blocked in China, this should pretty much prevent it from ever being seen there. Oh well.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have to say, I was a little uncertain of what to expect in China. Mostly because we&#8217;d been told by several Brits and Aussies that we could expect a plethora of unsanitary toilets, pushy and obnoxious people, and horrible trains.<br />
I really have to wonder what on Earth these people saw that was so bad?<br />
So far, we&#8217;ve had excellent experiences, even walking into alleyways that are likely more local than tourist. The bathrooms have been clean (mostly, some do have a fairly powerful odour), the food has been mostly outstanding, the people very friendly (&#8220;art students&#8221; aside, we&#8217;ve had a number of people who do just want to talk, even if Amy doesn&#8217;t dig the whole &#8220;practise my English&#8221; thing), and the pushy lines are no worse than trying to get into Future Shop on Boxing Day.<br />
Mind you, we&#8217;ve only just started China, but so far, I have little to complain about. Beijing is also a fairly modern city, which is a nice thing to see amidst all the old buildings, hutongs, and styles that make this metropolis up. I&#8217;ll be very interested to see how Shanghai is&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chalk up another notch on the Dead Communist Leader Tour.<br />
Today, Amy and I decided to keep things light, since our train leaves tonight for Shanghai. On the list of things to hit: Mao Ze Dong&#8217;s Mausoleum, and the Lama Temple. But first, the House of Mao&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-561"></span>When Mao finally kicked the bucket in the 70s, he was well into this 90s, something the Chinese are quite proud of (and probably cigarette companies, too, since he chain-smoked something fierce). When Mao died, they couldn&#8217;t simply bury him. He was (and still is) a driving force in Chinese life. So they built him a mausoleum. A big one. Nay, a gigantic one. One that rivals the size of small office buildings. All to house the not-really-decaying body of Mao.<br />
To keep this in perspective, I&#8217;ve also been to Lenin&#8217;s Mausoleum. (That was 16 years ago.) It&#8217;s very small, by comparison &#8212; maybe 10&#215;10 metres. This place is easy 100&#215;100 metres. And four or so stories tall. There&#8217;s considerably more security around it than at Lenin&#8217;s tomb, even during the Soviet era.<br />
<a><br />
<img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03645.JPG" alt="Mao's Mausoleum" width="300" /><br />
</a><br />
Because of all the shady people about, and because we couldn&#8217;t find lockers to stow our stuff so we could go inside, Amy and I took turns. Amy went first, because I&#8217;d already seen a dead commie. When I asked her how she felt when she got back, her immediate response was &#8220;respectful&#8221;.<br />
My turn. I had to stand in a line for about 10 minutes before they took a batch of about 40 people around the corner and inside the perimeter to see Mao. You pass by a small booth that sells fresh flowers to lay within the mausoleum building (though it&#8217;s interesting to note that the flowers are &#8220;laid&#8221; in a different room than Mao himself). Then up a set of stairs and into doors that wouldn&#8217;t be any different than an office building&#8217;s. Complete with revolving doors that can&#8217;t really be used all that often.<br />
The atrium features a larger-than-life white marble sculpture of Mao, seated facing north. This is where some kind of trough exists for placing the newly-purchased flowers. (A cynic might suggest that the flowers are collected and taken to the booth for resale.) The line winds around the atrium to the left (east), down the side of the building, then back to the centre to enter the mausoleum chamber. In the centre of the chamber is the Big Guy himself. There&#8217;s a glass wall that separates you from him, and several soldiers standing on guard. Mao is contained within a glass sarcophagus, his body draped in what looks to be a Soviet flag. (The hammer and sickle are a symbol of the people, though it would seem more appropriate to use the Chinese flag &#8230; that&#8217;s just me.)<br />
After being hustled through the Room of Mao, you enter into &#8230; a souvenir shop. No, I&#8217;m not kidding. I wish I were making that up. In fact, from the inside of the building all the way until you reach the perimeter again, it&#8217;s all Mao kitch. It&#8217;s tackiness on a level I can&#8217;t even begin to understand. The Soviets were never like this &#8212; Lenin&#8217;s tomb was a simple thing &#8212; even now, the Russians treat it with respect. (Although it&#8217;s said Lenin will be buried in St. Petersburg before too long.)<br />
Seeing Mao was interesting, but not so much as all the grandeur surrounding it. People still worship the man (inasmuch as the officially Communist state allows worship), gathering in lines readily, half of whom buy flowers, for a man most never met and even more whom weren&#8217;t even alive during his tenure as Chairman. The legacy lives on&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About the only thing Amy and I had on tap today was the Summer Palace. For this, we took three subways and a (decent) taxi to the location. Total cost: about 30 yuan, and about 30 minutes. The palace entrance was crowed with about half the population of Beijing, it seemed. High for a weekday, but we soon realized why&#8230;<br />
There&#8217;ve been storms here the last few days. Big ones. I haven&#8217;t heard a good thunderstorm in a long time. The rains, it seems, have washed away the all the haze and pollution that&#8217;s been hovering around the area for the last few days. (We should have gone to the Wall today, but c&#8217;est la vie.) This made The Summer Palace near perfect for visiting today. It wasn&#8217;t too hot, there was a great breeze (almost to the point of calling it &#8220;windy&#8221;) and the sky was actually blue (instead of the usual white with a blue tinge).<br />
<span id="more-559"></span>The Summer Palace was meant as a place for the royal family to escape the heat of the Forbidden City. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine why &#8212; all the walls there must prevent a good airflow. Out at the Summer Palace &#8212; easily three or four times the overall size &#8212; wind blows very easily. I&#8217;m almost surprised that the Forbidden City wasn&#8217;t just abandoned in favour of the Summer Palace. But that&#8217;s royalty for you&#8230;<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03641.JPG" alt="Protect the railings!" width="300" /></a><br />
We wandered all the way around the main lake, a distance of about five kilometres or so. The willow trees drifted in the wind, the clouds scattered the shadows about. Children played at the water&#8217;s edge while countless tourists and locals tried to escape the inevitable heat of the day. It&#8217;s a park now, with a bit of museum thrown in for flavour. It&#8217;s 35 yuan (about CDN$6) and worth every penny of admission.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03642.JPG" alt="The Summer Palace in Beijing" width="300" /></a><br />
After our ripoff cab ride, we went in search of dinner. The goal: Peking (Beijing) Duck. I&#8217;d had it before at Silver Dragon in Calgary, but Amy had never tried it before. We ended up at the same restaurant where we&#8217;d ate lunch about eight hours before, having ordered two places of potstickers that were easily three times the size of any I&#8217;d ever seen before (and boy, oh boy, were they good!). The place is down a back alley, on the second floor of an area that sells pretty much any food you can think of. The restaurant looks like an old community hall from Small Town Canada, and is sparsely decorated. That&#8217;s because the attention is put into the food.<br />
The kung pow chicken was spicy, but tasty. The boiling wok of whatnot (mostly chicken, chilies, and celery) was yummy. The duck, which arrived 45 minutes after ordering, was great. You know you&#8217;re in a good place to order Peking Duck when it meets the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s not advertised outside the restaurant.</li>
<li>The restaurant doesn&#8217;t have the word &#8220;duck&#8221; written anywhere in it&#8217;s name, especially in English.</li>
<li>You see the locals ordering it.</li>
</ol>
<p><a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03643.JPG" alt="Peking Duck ... mmmmmm" width="300" /></a><br />
I currently bear the battle scars of grease on my shorts. It&#8217;s a sign that the meal was good. My stomach might forgive me tomorrow. I doubt I&#8217;ll eat for a day or so, though&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Amy and I decided to take a taxi back from the Summer Palace to our hotel. Partly because the walk around the Palace grounds (which are huge) wore us out, and partly because we couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get back to the subway station we&#8217;d taken the taxi from in the first place.<br />
A warning, which will likely be universally understood by many travellers, some taxi drivers in Beijing are con artists. Well, more like would-be con artists, as to be a proper artist, you have to be accepted for your ability. The a-hole who decided to dupe us really didn&#8217;t come off that way.<br />
<span id="more-558"></span>As we&#8217;d exited the Summer Palace, this guy ran up to us with a card, said &#8220;meter!&#8221; (usually a good thing) and offered us his car. The card said &#8220;1.20&#8221;, which is supposed to be the rate per kilometre. At first, all was well. But by the time we hit the highway, I happened to notice that the fare was already 36 yuan, rather than a much lower (expected) rate. This set off my bullshit alarm, and I started to watch the meter earnestly, commenting to Amy that we were getting hosed.<br />
When we got to the hotel, the fare was 95 yuan for what shouldn&#8217;t have been more than about 60. We knew that by rough calculation. The driver tried to drop us off across the street from the hotel, but we directed him in (though he did try to avoid it). I guess he knew the jig was up when Amy called over one of the attendants who spoke English. (One advantage of a very nice hotel &#8212; staff who speak English quite well.) The driver offered 70. Given that he did get us there quickly, we agreed.<br />
How do you tell if you&#8217;re about to be ripped off? Glance at the meter. It should be in clear view. There will likely be three numbers: the rate (1.20, 1.60, or 1.80), the kilometres driven (which we think was also rigged, so check with your guides), and the time spent waiting (this doesn&#8217;t seem to affect the fare much). Watch the rate &#8212; ours changed from 1.20 to 1.80 pretty much whenever the driver pushed down on the accelerator.<br />
How to avoid? Peg the fare in advance before you leave, and write it down. Or use a taxi from a good hotel &#8212; they might cost a bit more, but they won&#8217;t pull silly buggers (as my dad used to say) with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My calf muscles are killing me. I don&#8217;t know how many stairs Noah, Justin, and I climbed yesterday, but I swear my calves have never received such a workout in their existences. And now they&#8217;re taking their revenge on me. Even small stairs hurt &#8230; a lot. They&#8217;re rocks attached to the backs of my legs. They don&#8217;t flex, they pulse. Forget the Stairmaster, folks! If you want a great workout, spend the money on a trip to China, then visit three different sections and walk as much of it as you can. Your legs will be cut out of stone in days.<br />
<span id="more-557"></span>The first thing we had to do this morning was change hotels. Due to a change in plans (namely, deciding we needed more time in Beijing, and no availability in the New World Beijing Courtyard), we had to madly scramble for a new hotel that wouldn&#8217;t put us out by the airport. The best we could end up with &#8212; and I do mean this figuratively &#8212; was <a href="http://beijing.peninsula.com/index.shtml">The Peninsula Palace</a>. For the record, I would like to state that I originally thought this to be a fancy name for a half-ways decent hotel in Beijing. I didn&#8217;t realize that this is also one of the top hotels in the country. I&#8217;m very thankful that the dollar goes <em>much</em> further here than it does at home. This hotel is not much more expensive than a decent place in Calgary. I still feel uncomfortable staying here.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03639.JPG" alt="The Peninsula Palace Hotel in Beijing" width="300" /></a><br />
Checked in, we headed out in search of a quick bite for lunch (we were actually hungry for a change). Pork dumplings packed away, we headed towards the Forbidden City.<br />
For the record, this place is big. Really big. Insanely big. It&#8217;s hard to imagine how big it is until you&#8217;re inside and walking up the middle of it. I&#8217;ve never seen anything so big. It&#8217;s a seemingly endless stream of courtyards, halls of Harmony (most of them were &#8220;bla bla of Harmony&#8221;), and scaffolding. Yes, scaffolding. We knew about this back in St. Petersburg. Beijing, in preparations for 2008, is dusting off the old China and polishing up the silverwear. Where there were probably at least 103 items on the audio tour menu, there are now a mere 17. Only the middle sections of the City are open &#8212; the wings and sides are all closed, undergoing a massive overhaul in preparation for a flood of tourists.<br />
Oh, as a side note, there are a number of people who warned us about the bathrooms here. And the chaotic lines, and the spitting &#8230; the list was quite lengthy, I assure you. While I can&#8217;t speak for Amy, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll agree that so far, we can&#8217;t understand what all the problems are. Bathrooms are mostly clean (the squat ones, anyway &#8212; I haven&#8217;t been in the western side to know for sure), the crowds are more than manageable, and spitting has been minimal. We still have a few cities to go, mind you, so that might yet change.<br />
We picked up the audio tour. The English version is voiced by none other than Roger Moore. Assumedly, the recording is a few years old, now, but 007 still sounds as cool now as he did in <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071807/combined">The Man With the Golden Gun</a></em> &#8212; my favourite Bond film with Moore. Even if you&#8217;re here before the palace completely reopens, I highly recommend the audio tour. Although there are nice signs put up by American Express and some audio explanations piped over speakers, there&#8217;s nothing quite like velvet pouring into your ear as you walk around (although bring your own headphones &#8212; the ear piece they supply is a tad painful).<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03637.JPG" alt="Inside the Forbidden City in Beijing" width="300" /></a><br />
Barely halfway into the tour, thunder rumbled. We&#8217;d had a thunderstorm last night, and it looked like we hadn&#8217;t seen the end of it. Sure enough, just as we reached the end of the tour, the smattering of rain we had been receiving turned into a deluge. When it finally let up a bit, Amy and I darted out from our shelter under one of the many covered patios and made a break for the exit and a taxi. Not wanting to get stuck with some schmuck trying to rip us off, we decided to walk down the block a bit. We had vendor after vendor offer us umbrellas and carts and bicycle-rickshaws try to pick us up and get us out of the rain. We pressed on. It started to hail, but we pressed on.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03638.JPG" alt="Some strange signs" width="300" /></a><br />
Finally taking shelter under an eaves down a road on the east side of the City, we contemplated the fact that we were soaked. Our bags, thankfully, are built well enough to prevent leakage. Our clothes, not so much. When the rain finally let up, we headed back to the hotel to rest up a bit. A dip in the pool, a shower, and we went in search of the nearby mall for dinner. We found a bakery and the illusive BBQ pork buns. It took us until today to find these tasty little morsels. But when we tried to leave to go home &#8212; more rain. Torrents of us. We holed up in the Grand Hyatt&#8217;s lobby lounge (the hotel is attached to the mall) until it passed.<br />
Tomorrow, we&#8217;re going to check out Dead Mao, and possibly the Summer Palace. One more full day, and then we&#8217;re off to Shanghai!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lonely Planet recommends going to Tianjin, especially to see the antique market there. It is said that a lot of the materials there were confiscated during the Cultural Revolution, and are now being sold to the dealers, who in turn sell it at the market. Theoretically, neat stuff, right?<br />
This brought Amy and I to hop on the first Beijing &#8211; Tianjen express train this morning. A jaunty 90-minute trip on a fairly zippy (and comfy) train that deposited us at a rather chaotic train station. We walked from there roughly south-west (&#8220;roughly&#8221; because the street grid is slightly skewed, and got us turned around more than once) when we stumbled across a rather large and bustling pedestrian mall.<br />
As Amy so aptly put it, this distracted us a while.<br />
<span id="more-554"></span>Also as Amy so aptly put it, the heat and humidity took their toll. On me, it&#8217;s my right hip. It&#8217;s been bugging me for a few years, but only when it&#8217;s hot and humid &#8212; it rather is an issue in Calgary. It was almost throbbing last night; today it was just a nuisance. Enough to make me want to sit down for a little while, at any rate. This led us to the RBT restaurant in one of the large malls along the road. We went there on our first night in Beijing for a bite to eat. The food is great, the drinks are amazing (a kumquat and honey smoothie, which I sadly did not have), and the view was pretty neat, too.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03630.JPG" alt="The view from the RBT restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy&#8217;s feet, however, put her out of commission, so she encouraged me to continue the search for the antiques market. Given the state of road signs in Tianjen (which is mostly non-existent along the pedestrian streets), it wasn&#8217;t the easiest find. But sure enough, right where #7 lies on the Lonely Planet Map B of Tianjin, there was the market.<br />
Not exactly a let-down, but let&#8217;s just say that my expectations were a <em>tad</em> higher.<br />
There are essentially two streets that intersect. Fairly quiet, with stores along one road, some along on the other mixed in with blankets on the side of the road. There were a few Mao bits of memorabilia, but if this stuff was antique, I&#8217;ve got a nice acre patch of land in downtown Toronto for sale&#8230; There were some nice-looking lamps, some old records (nothing you&#8217;d find interesting, Schill), more &#8220;jade&#8221; than you could use to tile your house, an so forth. A few stalls had some legit stuff, pocket watches for example, but the pickings were slim.<br />
If you&#8217;re going to China, and you have your heart set on hitting the antiques market, think hard about it. Tianjin is a nice little city, but if you&#8217;re going out of the way just for the market, you might be disappointed.<br />
As we&#8217;d had a 14:00 regroup time at the Starbucks, I went searching around for other things in the area. I found a little park, a nice little shopping arcade, an outdoor cafeteria so full of wood smoke (from the meat skewers) it was actually hard to see, and countless little alleyways. Amy was resting with her mango drink. I acquired a vanilla frappuccino (not sure if that&#8217;s spelled right, but I ain&#8217;t gonna check). It was too hot to even think.<br />
I have to wholly agree with Amy &#8212; the dumplings were great, the beer was below sub-standard (sorry Greg, but Bud sucks), and the girl making the dumplings was a blur. It was like watching kung fu movies where the action is sped up.<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/MOV03632.MPG"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03631.JPG" alt="Dumpling Fists of Lightning!" width="300" /></a><br />
We&#8217;re relaxing tonight. Hopefully, Amy&#8217;s feet can handle the Wall tomorrow. We&#8217;d made arrangements with Noah and Justin, and I&#8217;d hate to put them out. Our plans can change &#8212; theirs can&#8217;t. We shall see&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was errand day. Today, we decided to get our train tickets sorted out, and make plans for an excursion to the Great Wall. Inadvertantly, some things happened along the way&#8230;<br />
First off, we hopped the subway down to Qianmen station (which is Tiananmen Square, but we weren&#8217;t headed there) to search through the hutong neighbourhoods. After a little dive in, we were diverted due to biological reasons (namely self-preservation having not to use the toilets in the back alleys). Out back on the main street, the decision was made to skip ahead to the Grand Hyatt Hotel for two reasons: exchange traveller&#8217;s cheques and see if they can handle tour bookings a little more easily.<br />
<span id="more-553"></span>(Just as a side note: if you&#8217;re travelling to parts distant, such as Russia, England, China, Hong Kong, Japan, and so forth, don&#8217;t bother with travellers cheques. Yes, they&#8217;re safe. Yes, they can be replaced. But they are <strong>not</strong> accepted everywhere. It&#8217;s (pardon ma français) fucking annoying. Everywhere we&#8217;ve been, it&#8217;s been &#8220;sorry, we don&#8217;t accept those&#8221;. I&#8217;ve exchanged them successfully <strong>once</strong>. If you&#8217;re going, just bring a bank card and a VISA card. That&#8217;s all you need. Trust me on this. Even in Mongolia, you can use them &#8212; they have no ATMs, but banks will do the withdrawal for you.)<br />
We scooted up the sidewalk on the east side of the road of Tiananmen Square, in the hopes of an expedient passage. We were almost immediately hit with the Art Exhibit people.<br />
The Art Exhibit people, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a bit of a scam. The idea is to entice tourists (generally English-speaking, as they don&#8217;t seem to speak other languages) to see an &#8220;art exhibit&#8221; that will close &#8220;in five minutes&#8221;, and encourage you to purchase something. It&#8217;s all quite nice, starting with &#8220;hello&#8221;, then going to &#8220;where are you from&#8221; to &#8220;is this your first or second time&#8221;, to the shpeal about the art exhibition. We&#8217;d been warned about this not only from Lonely Planet (thanks, guys!) but also by others who&#8217;ve been here before. In the span of about seven minutes we were hit four times. The last time, we resorted to speaking French to throw them off.<br />
About 10 seconds after that, we ran into Noah and Justin, two brothers originally from Montreal who were touring China. We immediately hit it off with them, recounting our mutual experiences with trying to shake the sharks after the tourists. (Noah has a particularly novel way of getting rid of them. He looks them in the face, and tells them &#8220;I don&#8217;t speak English&#8221; as clearly as if he were telling you his phone number. Noah seems to follow the philosophy that visiting China is almost a game. We like these guys.)<br />
The four of us pretty much hit it off (partly because Amy and I have been dying for some home-grown company, and both of them had great senses of humour), and hung out for most of the afternoon. We all headed down to the Grand Hyatt where I failed (yet again) to change all my damned travellers cheques for renminbi. (I&#8217;m so <em>never</em> taking these things again!) Then we tried to book a tour to the Great Wall.<br />
We&#8217;ve been told that going to the Great Wall might not be fun. It all depends. For starters, you don&#8217;t go to Badaling if you&#8217;re actually looking for the Wall. Badaling is a restored section of the Great Wall, done in the grand ol&#8217; Disney style. We&#8217;re thinking of Simitai, which is a little more authentic (at least according to Lonely Planet). But getting there is a bit more difficult. The conceirge at the Grand Hyatt (exceedingly nice, and outstanding English) suggested a taxi, which should cost about 800 renminbi (a little over $120, divided amongst four people) &#8212; considerably cheaper than any of the tour prices.<br />
Justin and Noah then went to purchase tickets for their trip back to Shanghai (they&#8217;re flying in and out of there through Air Canada, and have yet to take the train here), and Amy finally found replacement books (she&#8217;s been suffering through Dostoyevsky for weeks). A trip through the rather nice mall nearby followed.<br />
One thing about Beijing that all of us noticed. They&#8217;ve got the whole communist thing sorted out (mostly, aside from the odd overzealous crackdown, anyway). The mall was <em>better</em> than almost any that I&#8217;ve seen in North America. There were even BMW, Audi, and Volkswagon dealerships! And a store that sold a whack of Star Wars and Astroboy shirts.<br />
Our ultimate destination, though, was Silk Street. This is the ultimate in (potential) bargains. It&#8217;s a massive four-floor store where you can find all sorts of brand-name clothing (whether or not it&#8217;s real depends on how good you are at mind-reading), and all of it for sale at a price you can attempt to get, if you&#8217;re good. This is where the good haggler comes into effect. So far, this isn&#8217;t me. You don&#8217;t get to browse here. You need to know what you&#8217;re looking for. You need to know what it is you want, and you need to be ready to wheel and deal. I figured this out after casually looking at a North Face jacket and deciding that it wasn&#8217;t anything I was interested in. I could have picked it up for about $10. Amy went after a Gap shirt (definitely fake) and a pair of zip-off pants. We&#8217;re thinking of going back to see if we can get some other bargoons.<br />
Noah and Justin tried to get $25 Armani suits. They didn&#8217;t succeed &#8230; this time.<br />
Walking through the place is hard. Not because it&#8217;s crowded, but because some of the vendors are fairly aggressive. (Noah swears that a couple of other places, such as Hong Kong, are worse.) You hear greetings shouted out often starting with &#8220;Mister&#8221; and &#8220;Lady&#8221;. One tried to tell my that my beloved Critical Mass sling pack is dirty. (A mark of pride, thank you very much!) Trying to leave the place through the somewhat-unmentionables area, we were treated to &#8220;Hello, underwear!&#8221;and &#8220;Hello, socks!&#8221;. Very surreal.<br />
Dinner was an interesting experience, with Amy and I (we&#8217;ll hook up with Justin and Noah for the Great Wall on Monday) walking into a restaurant near our hotel. I love the Chinese way of naming foods. It&#8217;s like trying to decipher the title of a Led Zeppelin tune to figure what it&#8217;s about. Such items included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The asparagus fries the shelled shrimp (shrimp with asparagus)</li>
<li>The exquisite article livings purely (beer)</li>
<li>The thou is more the dragon mountain</li>
<li>Wrap the male fish (fish with vegetables, near as we can figure)</li>
<li>The parsley mixs the hair belly (I don&#8217;t think I wanna know)</li>
<p>And my personal favourite, although we didn&#8217;t order it:</p>
<li>An article steams the big cabbage</li>
</ul>
<p>The food, however, was pretty darn good, even if the start of one section read:<br />

That was for the seafood section. Go fig.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I woke up at the Datong station. I&#8217;d slept about seven hours, but decided that I wasn&#8217;t going to miss crossing this part of China. I was in a new country, and be darned if I&#8217;m not going to witness this!<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03621.JPG" alt="Datong station" width="300" /></a><br />
<span id="more-552"></span>I could&#8217;ve slept longer &#8212; it was pretty dull until we got close to the mountains near Beijing. These are natural barriers over which a somewhat fairly redundant Great Wall was erected. As of yet, Chinese engineers haven&#8217;t made a massive tunnel to speed trains through to the capital. To get there, you need a second engine for the operation. The grade runs to about 4% in a few places, but that&#8217;s not the whole reason. The train actually has to reverse direction like a switchback to make it down the mountain. I&#8217;m not entirely sure why. The second engine then becomes the lead all the way to Beijing.<br />
Finding our hotel usually ends up being a bit of a misadventure. Except in Moscow (where it was hard to miss) and Ulaan Baatar (where we were picked up), we&#8217;ve always had some difficulty finding where we were staying. Sometimes signs aren&#8217;t visible or the map isn&#8217;t clear. In this case, a whole new language, an unclear map, and no signs pretty much conspired to lead us to a nearby Novotel where the French concierge was kind enough to give us specific directions.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03623.JPG" alt="One of the massive roads near our hotel" width="300" /></a><br />
The area is nice &#8212; we&#8217;re even near a rather large mall. We partook of an early dinner of noodles (and beer), which ran about Y80, or about CDN$14. I think it was a bit pricey, but Amy contends it was suitable. Having some time, we scooted over to Tiananmen Square to check it out in the setting sun.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03624.JPG" alt="Amy thoroughly enjoying her first meal in China" width="300" /></a><br />
We hadn&#8217;t even gotten out of the subway when we bumped into the two folks we talked with at length during our 10 hour crossing of the Russia &#8211; Mongolia border (the girl and I recognized each other in passing; she has a distinctive nose ring). Apparently, we were on the same train, but hadn&#8217;t crossed paths this time. (Instead, we ran into two guys from University of Western Ontario&#8217;s Ivy Business School, who&#8217;d been teaching for three months in Irkutsk.)<br />
Until now, we&#8217;ve been afforded the luxury of being the foreign tourist to completely ignore. Not here. My Canadian shirt (there&#8217;s a maple leaf emblazoned on my left shoulder) attracts a lot of attention. Within moments of trying to take a picture of one of the massive gates (huge buildings, not at all like the one in your chain like fence), a young Chinese couple came up and asked if I was Canadian. He was an English teacher, and wanted to talk to someone who spoke English, I guess. They were wonderful people, even giving us directions to an excellent dumpling restaurant that Amy and I will likely track down tomorrow. (They also told us to avoid the Peking Duck restaurant on our map; it&#8217;s well-known, but a poor value.)<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03625.JPG" alt="Flag lowering at Tiananmen Square" width="300" /></a><br />
Later, as we tried to watch the daily flag lowering, a young girl asked Amy and I to pose for a photo with her and a friend. Why do I suddenly feel like Brad Pitt?? About 30 minutes after that, as Amy and I tried to walk back to the subway, <em>another</em> couple asked if we were Europeans (we corrected them) and got into a conversation on how to get to Europe from China by train, and information about the buildings at Tiananmen Square.<br />
We&#8217;re here. We&#8217;re tired, but we&#8217;re here. Now we just need to figure out what to do next.</p>
