								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03526.JPG" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" width="300" /></a><br />
Our British Airways 747 to London:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03527.JPG" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" width="300" /></a><br />
The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03533.JPG" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03567.JPG" alt="A small, nameless Siberian village" width="300" /></a><br />
And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a><br />
We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a><br />
A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a><br />
Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a><br />
I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />

Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />

One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cold seems to be slowly moving away. It hit me a little harder than it did Amy, so while she dealt mostly with the sniffles, I&#8217;ve been dealt the ol&#8217; phlegm-attack. Mostly throat clearing, so it ain&#8217;t all nasty.<br />
Until today, I had yet to cash any of my traveller&#8217;s cheques. Useful things these are not. Major problem: very few places in Russia care to honour them. You have search high and low to find places that will handle them, and not for an obscene rate of conversion. It&#8217;s silly, really. In future, I&#8217;m sticking to my usual system: bring a bank card. It&#8217;s accepted at most ATMs world-wide, though you do sometimes have to hunt for the right ones.<br />
<span id="more-544"></span>After that, we got our visas registered for Irkutsk. It&#8217;s a leftover from the Soviet era, so far as I can understand. Basically, any place you stay overnight, you should have your visa registered by your hotel or by the registration office. What ultimate purpose this serves, I have no idea. All I do know is that if your visa isn&#8217;t suitably registered, and you don&#8217;t have all the paperwork, you&#8217;re likely to be buying out the border guard as you try to exit. Most importantly, as in our case, if travelling by train.<br />
Jack had double-booked himself for today, and had to take a group out of town on a three-day excursion (to where, I have no idea). He was supposed to take us to Listvyanka, a small town on the shore of Lake Baikal, about 60 kms away. Instead, he made arrangements with his friend Leonid (yes, like the meteor shower) to take us out.<br />
When I&#8217;d talked with Leonid last night, I had wondered what lay in store for us. Was he just a &#8220;friend&#8221;, or was there more of a professional association to him? (As Amy has pointed out, Leonid has his own company for this very thing. Normally, he does long-term fishing excursions, but made an exception for us.) He rolled up to Jack&#8217;s homestay almost exactly at noon &#8212; when he&#8217;d promised to be there.<br />
Leonid has a nice car &#8212; nice by Russian standards, definitely; nice by North American standards, pretty much. It&#8217;s a Toyota Mark II &#8212; Japanese model, so far as I can tell. (It was right-side drive.) The sound system was aftermarket, though, and was regularly playing Ivan Kupala &#8212; an artist reminiscent of Enigma and Delerium, except that he used the songs of old Russian women (singing old Russian songs) as the main part. Amy and I will be hunting for this CD, without question.<br />
After a short stop at the local DHL (despite packing light, this is the second batch of things Amy has sent home &#8212; keep in mind, however, that she did buy 10 balls of yarn in Kazan), we headed out on the sole road from Irkutsk to Listvyanka. It&#8217;s a rolling road, curving sometimes within sight of the Angara River, lined with birch, larch, and various coniferous trees.<br />
Our first stop, however, was not Listvyanka &#8212; it was the Museum of Wooden Architecture. Sounds kinda silly, I know, but museum is just like Heritage Park (in Calgary) or any other pioneer-esque recreation village showing the way life used to be here. But it&#8217;s not all about the stereotypical exiled-Russian-living-in-Siberia thing. This was about the Cossaks, the first Europeans to move to this region. How they built their forts to survive against the weather. And about the Buryats, decendents of the Mongols who settled here in permanent wooden gers.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03579.JPG" alt="The Museum of Wooden Arcitecture near Irkutsk" width="300" /></a><br />
The entire village is made of various buildings, most of which were brought to the museum before their original village locations (often many kilometres away) were flooded out with the damming of the Angara back in the 50s. The reconstruction is mostly complete, and gives a pretty clear idea of what life was like in this region of the world, 300 years ago.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03580.JPG" alt="Inside one of the buildings at the museum" width="300" /></a><br />
That&#8217;s the key difference between what we see at home and what&#8217;s here. The stuff we have in Calgary is rarely older than 150 years. This is twice that. The buildings are solid wood &#8212; mostly log houses (in various forms). Some are intricate, having several rooms, and separate buildings (for storage of grains and animals). There was a certain flow to everything.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03584.JPG" alt="Me, at the Museum of Wooden Architecture near Irkutsk (I gotta try to keep up with Amy!)" width="300" /></a><br />
Each building also had what Leonid called a &#8220;red corner&#8221;, which is supposed to be on the right side of the main room when seen from the door. This is what most would call a shrine. It depicts the Russian orthodox religion, and is a personal place of worship outside of the church. Leonid didn&#8217;t know why it was a &#8220;red&#8221; corner, though. I think it&#8217;s because the Russian word &#8220;Ã ºÃ‘â‚¬Ã °Ã‘ Ã ½Ã‘ &#8221; originally meant &#8220;beautiful&#8221; in English. Only today does it mean &#8220;red&#8221; &#8212; and the original meaning is lost in translation.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03581.JPG" alt="An example of a Red Corner; the museum screwed up and put it on the left side by accident" width="300" /></a><br />
From the museum, we continued down to Listvyanka. When we reached the mouth of the river, Leonid pulled his car over and told us a story about a rock that you can see in the mouth. The legend says that Lake Baikal has 340 sons, but only one daughter &#8212; the Angara River, the sole outlet of the world largest freshwater lake (by volume). The Angara flows into the Yenisey, and it&#8217;s said that the Angara wished to leave Lake Baikal to be with her lover. Lake Baikal refused and threw a stone to keep her from getting away. Today, it&#8217;s called the &#8220;shaman&#8217;s stone&#8221;. Angara got away, however, and Lake Baikal grew bitter and cold. It&#8217;s known for freezing over entirely, and for very nasty storms.<br />
Listvyanka is a town that was forgotten by the Soviet regime &#8212; or the town chose simply to ignore it. The entire village is wooden; the original part, anyway. Because of its proximity to Lake Baikal, many of the nouveau riche have bought up land and erected the most gaudy monstrosities you&#8217;ve ever seen. They look like someone tried to replicate a fairy tale castle, but used cheap bricks and garish pink paint.<br />
Ew.<br />
Lonely Planet (among various sources) recommended Listvyanka as a place to visit because it is reflective of an old Russian fishing village. It&#8217;s harder to see now, with the newer buildings (and a hotel under construction) that effectively ruin the charm. It was neat to see, but I imagine that within two years, Listvyanka won&#8217;t have the same appeal it did even a year ago.<br />
As we drove down the waterfront, we spotted ice washing up on shore. Leonid had told us that as little as three days ago (!), there was still ice on Lake Baikal in this area. Indeed, if you go further north, you can still drive across the lake &#8212; the ice will remain until well into June. The ice, combined with Lake Baikal&#8217;s ferocity, turned a wooden breakwater into near toothpicks a week ago.<br />
The pier was full of vendors. Some selling cheap (but expensive) souveniers, and lots of fish. The lake is full of fish and tends to be quite bountiful. And clear, so the fish likely taste quite good. We weren&#8217;t too keen on anything fishy today, though.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03586.JPG" alt="Me (with suitably dopey grin) at Lake Baikal" width="300" /></a><br />
We returned to Irkutsk, stopping only a couple of times for a last look at the lake, and for a nice photo op we noticed on the way back. It was a six-hour excursion, and both Amy and I would highly recommend calling Leonid if you&#8217;re in the area and need an excellent guide.<br />
Tomorrow, we head off for Ulan Ude. We&#8217;re nearly out of Russia and into Mongolia. Time is passing too slowly for me, though, as I want to get moving back towards home. As much as I love travelling, I really miss Alex.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that feeling you get, when you&#8217;re finding yourself walking down a street in a dream, and you&#8217;re not sure if you know where you are, but you keep going anyway? That&#8217;s what Amy and I have been feeling like the last few hours. We&#8217;ve been speculating to guess why (I attributed part of it to being sick and drugged up on Contac-C; Amy&#8217;s blaming the fish she had for dinner last night), but we&#8217;re not entirely sure.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03574.JPG" width="300" alt="The Irkutsk railway station" /></a><br />
<span id="more-543"></span>We figure part of it is due to not knowing exactly where we were staying. Amy&#8217;d emailed Jack &#8212; our homestay host &#8212; only to receive not that he was out of town. Turns out he&#8217;s not, and it was an old notice. Before we&#8217;d found that out, though, we&#8217;d indulged ourselves in a little comfort food.<br />
Sushi. (We love the stuff.)<br />
It was the first time I&#8217;d ever been in a Japanese restaurant that didn&#8217;t have a single Japanese person working there. Bit of a switch, I have to say. The food was pretty good, even if I could only barely taste the pickled ginger (I hate being sick <em>(cough)</em>).<br />
We wandered around a bit, still in a daze, before we finally found a pay phone that took coins. Weird thing &#8212; almost none of the phones in Russia take coins. Almost all of them take phone cards. Which we don&#8217;t have, and aren&#8217;t even sure how to buy. The connection was lousy (it was an old phone &#8212; you dialed the number, inserted the coin, and then pressed a little button to make the coin drop when you finally connected with the other person), but we got enough information to find the building.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03575.JPG" width="300" alt="Yes, it's a camel. No, I don't know what it's doing in Irkutsk." /></a><br />
Just not the door. We had to call back from the internet cafe we were at this morning. That was much better, and we met Elena in the alley. Figured that it was the one door we didn&#8217;t try because we didn&#8217;t see the buzzer. Now we know better&#8230;<br />
I feel a whole lot better having finally found the place we&#8217;re staying for two nights. It&#8217;s going to be relaxful because there is no rush, no need to run to the next place. And no flotilla of security to prevent us from going wherever we want.<br />
We&#8217;ve been on the go, more or less, since we left Moscow. (Which, incidentally, was the last time I showered properly. I&#8217;m amazed Amy hasn&#8217;t passed out from the smell. I&#8217;m sure my pants are fully capable of sentience at this point.)  You have no idea how good it feels just to stop moving, even if just for a day.<br />
The place is nice, though you wouldn&#8217;t know from the stairwell. It&#8217;s even sketchier than Nord Hostel in St. Petersburg. The inside of the apartment is quite nice, and there&#8217;s a little cat (Fyodor, apparently after the writer) to entertain us.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03576.JPG" width="300" alt="Fyodor the cat" /></a><br />
Tomorrow, we&#8217;re off to Listyvanka, which is a small village on Lake Baikal, which is &#8220;traditional Siberian&#8221;, which means all wooden buildings. There&#8217;s a number of those here in downtown Irkutsk (pop. ~600k), but I imagine kept in better conditions.<br />
Until then&#8230; to rest, to sleep &#8212; perchance to dream&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, sitting in the only internet connection in all of Krasnoyarsk (or seemingly so), Amy dove into one of the sites she used extensively for planning this trip: <a href="http://www.poezda.net">poezda.net</a>. There, she found that there was a train hitting Krasnoyarsk (roughly translated as &#8220;ass end of Russia&#8221;) in about an hour and a half from then, which could whisk us away from the cultural wasteland that is Krasnoyarsk.<br />
(As a note, someone actually told us that Krasnoyarsk is the cultural centre of Siberia. This leads me to conclude that the person is lying or vastly misinformed, or Siberia has no culture whatsoever. Personally, I find the latter very hard to believe.)<br />
<span id="more-541"></span>Arriving at the train station, we bolted upstairs to the ticket office and tried to figure out which ticket booth to go to. It took a moment to realize that the four displays showing the lists of trains were for different days. We lined up for the booth selling tickets for &#8230; well, yesterday, now.<br />
Actually, not entirely true. Amy stood in line. I went to get the bags we&#8217;d put in storage for our 18-ish hour foray into town.<br />
Thus began Amy&#8217;s Herculean task: trying to buy train tickets without speaking Russian. Krasnoyarsk is the first place we&#8217;ve been where English is more-or-less unknown. The major catch here was to make sure that Amy and I were in the same compartment. (Neither one of us really wants to get stuck in a room with three drunk Russian men, Amy least of all.)<br />
Try and explain the need for that when you don&#8217;t know Russian, the clerk doesn&#8217;t know English, and our handy phrasebooks don&#8217;t cover that scenario.<br />
But Amy did it. A small notebook became a place for certain keywords (written in Russian) and drawings showing the four bunks in a room. The clerk caught on fairly quickly that we didn&#8217;t speak Russian, so did her best to try and tell us that there weren&#8217;t two bunks in second class &#8212; at least not in the same room. (If you&#8217;ve ever played charades, you&#8217;d probably have done well to decipher what went on.)<br />
I really should have video taped this. Though not nearly as funny as Amy&#8217;s experience trying to buy yarn in Kazan, it was an amazingly frustrating thing to watch &#8212; I still don&#8217;t know how Amy did it. (I doubt I could have taped it, though, since I doubt Russians like having cameras in their ticket areas.)<br />
Finally, after about 10 minutes, we learned that two berths in the same compartment were available &#8212; but in <strong>First Class</strong>. Certainly more money than we would have cared to spend before we left North America. However, the pain we felt in Moscow still lingering, we didn&#8217;t want to rot away in a city neither of us had taken a liking to, and the prospect of moving on earlier to Irkutsk just seemed like a far better solution.<br />
Besides, we&#8217;ve been keeping it pretty lean with expenditures.<br />
The #10 train is quite nice, and the First Class great if for only one reason: no-one else for us to bother, or to bother us. It&#8217;s much more relaxing.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03568.JPG" alt="Birch trees -- there are a *lot* of these in Siberia" width="300" /></a><br />
So Amy comes to the rescue again, and we&#8217;re now safely in Irkutsk. All we need to do is hook up with our homestay guide. This should be interesting, since his email automatically replied saying he was out of town&#8230;</p>
