										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, okay, not so much &#8220;blogging&#8221; as journaling, but most of them are now online for everyone to ignore.<br />
Twenty years ago, I got to do something that (comparatively) very few westerners got to do, and will never get to do again: <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/1989/07/behind-iron-curtain-moscow-flight/">I went behind the Iron Curtain</a>. I visited the (former) Soviet Union. Believe it or not, the journey was a field trip, organised by one of the teachers in my school board. We had to do prerequisite classwork and had to write two length reports, all of which added up to academic credits.<br />
And we had to write a journal.<br />
<span id="more-1429"></span>My journal, as originally written, was short. I didn&#8217;t go for depth of content. (Yes, you can all insert &#8220;unbelievable shock&#8221; here.) I wasn&#8217;t a writer &#8230; yet. I was a kid in a foreign country (my first foray outside of North America) experiencing a part of the world few people had any desire to see at all, and was largely misunderstood except for what mainstream media portrayed.<br />
At the time I wrote it, there wasn&#8217;t a lot of understanding about what the journal was for, except maybe as source material for our reports that we would write afterwards. Little did we know that when we got back, we had to hand in our journals for grading.<br />
If you&#8217;ve ever seen my handwriting, you know this is a Bad Thing.<br />
So I did what any smart kid (who wanted a really good grade) would do: I typed it all out. Except the more I typed, the more I inserted because I remembered other things. Before long, my 10 or so pages of journal entries had turned into over 100 pages. Single spaced. (I got an A+, by the way.)<br />
That was the moment I started to become a writer. I look back at that journal now and &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say I&#8217;ve had many years to improve my writing ability. But that was the start.<br />
Twenty years is a long time to be writing. I&#8217;m having real trouble believing it&#8217;s been that long. Come January 2010, it&#8217;ll have been 10 years since I started writing internet-based journals (that eventually became the blogging we all know and love).<br />
And with this post, at least according to my WordPress post count, is number 1,000. (That includes a couple of drafts that are coming shortly, and posts you can&#8217;t see.) That might not seem like a lot, but when each post is over 1,000 words &#8230; well, you do the math.<br />
So, in a way, this is an anniversary: the birth of The Observer, my (former) self-assigned moniker for my journaling habits. A birthday.<br />
Happy birthday, Me!</p>

Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />

And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />

The forests often get thicker, too:<br />

Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />

This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />

Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />

Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />

We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />

A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />

Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />

We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />

This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />

It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />

Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />

We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />

I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />

At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />

Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />

One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We knew this was going to be rough. We knew this was going to be long. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as we thought it might be, but it was still <strong>long</strong>.<br />
We took Train 364 (formerly 264) from Ulan Ude to Ulaan Baatar. (The train itself runs Irkutsk to UB.) As we would find out, the whole train doesn&#8217;t go to Mongolia &#8212; only the cars that contain passengers going to Mongolia. We found this out when we got to the Naushki station, on the Russian/Mongolian border.<br />
<span id="more-548"></span>The Russians started shunting our car around. I think this was mostly to kill time. Why else would they continually back up, go forward, back up, go forward, and so forth for about an <em>hour</em>? Incidentally, Russian cars (as Amy and I decided) are not built for the harsh conditions of operation in Russia. They&#8217;re built to withstand the abuse from the engineers. I thought they were going to shake the whole car apart!<br />
We finally ended up, alone, completely separate from the rest of the train:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03590.JPG" alt="All alone, sitting out in the open" width="300" /></a><br />
As we would also decide later, this was because our car was the only one going to Mongolia. The other cars were part of the train that terminated at Naushki, and would return to Irkutsk with new passengers.<br />
And so began our wait. And wait we did. It would be a few hours before we saw anyone official-like board our train. At first, it was just someone to check our passports and make sure they were in order. That was a quick check. It was easily two more hours past that before the real officials came out. (When they did, soliders closed down the platform &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t go out there until you were supposed to be out there.) While we waited, we amused ourselves by watching a pile driver:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03591.JPG" alt="How do these things work, anyway?" width="300" /></a><br />
Yes, we were that bored.<br />
With the final forms filled out (the exit customs form) and our passports, stamped, we resumed our waiting.<br />
Six hours after we got there, we finally left, a single car towed by a lonely diesel locomotive out to Sukhbaatar, 21 kilometres inside the Mongolian border.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03592.JPG" alt="The station at Sukhbaatar" width="300" /></a><br />
To wait some more.<br />
After a couple of hours, the Mongolians started to let us in. This involved three forms (entry/exit form, health form, and customs form). After the health form was signed, we got scammed into US$10 health insurance. I&#8217;ve heard this is bogus, but we were too tired to care at that point. In between the official stamping of passports, we received a barrage of people who wanted to exchange our rubles for togrogs &#8212; which we&#8217;d already done in Naushki. They kept at is, the same people asking many times, despite us saying (more and more loudly every time) that we have none!<br />
Finally, passports stamped (using their hands as the table for stamping, despite one being in the cabin), we finally left Sukhbaatar for Ulaan Baatar.<br />
Total crossing time: 10 hours. Ish.<br />
Luckily, mostly done during the day. The other way, I gather it&#8217;s mostly at night. Ugh!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve reached the end of our time here in Russia. Tomorrow morning, early, we&#8217;re off to Mongolia. And a 10+ hour border-crossing, so we&#8217;re told. It&#8217;s simultaneously a horror story and a quest of patience, so it seems.<br />
After we arrived last night, literally 10 minutes into being in our new hotel room, the phone rang. It was &#8220;Helga from St. Petersburg&#8221;. Being more than just a little out of it, I assumed Helga was our tour operator, and was arranging our tour for tomorrow. She said she would be in the hotel, and we could meet her in the &#8220;cafeteria&#8221; (more like a bar with food). This was great since she had our train tickets to Ulaan Baatar, and would give us the details for our tour to the Datsun &#8212; the Buddhist template near Ulan Ude.<br />
<span id="more-546"></span>We walked into the cafe (as it&#8217;s referred to) about 20 minutes later only to find, much to our deep surprise, Helga &#8212; the woman we&#8217;d met in St. Petersburg whom we&#8217;d tried very desperately to avoid. (Helga had originally asked for all the details of our trip so she could tag along with us, not wanting to do the trip alone. We weren&#8217;t particularly happy about that, since we&#8217;d spent so much time and effort planning to this as a duo &#8212; not a trio.) This was not the surprise I&#8217;d wanted.<br />
Since Helga had some of the information we needed, we opted to talk with her until she left for her homestay, some distance from the Hotel Geser. Why did she have all this information? She ran into the tour guide we were using, and had signed up for the same tour to the Datsun.<br />
The trip out today was quite nice, actually. Ulan Ude is in a steppe valley, which is wide, expansive, and fairly flat. It&#8217;s dominated more by <em>dacha</em> (small cottages). Otherwise, short grasses and free-roaming animals (cows, goats, horses) which are &#8220;owned&#8221; by the local buryat inhabitants. The region we&#8217;re in is named for them: Buryatia. They&#8217;re an offshoot of Mongolian society, who&#8217;ve decided not to be nomadic and settle permanently.<br />
The result of the Mongolian influence in this area brings the Buddhism, which is what we&#8217;d planned to see today. <a href="http://www.stupa.org.nz/stupa/russia.htm">Ivolginsky Datsun</a> dates back only to 1947, when Stalin (of all people!) allowed limited religious practices for recognized minorities, such as the buryats.<br />
On the 30 km drive out to the Datsun, our guide Ilyena (I believe that was her name) attempted to explain the history of Ulan Ude, the general environment around us, and the basics of Buddhism. All of which Helga continually interrupted with questions &#8212; some decent, but mostly inane. And annoying, since Ilyena was continually put off her speech, and found it difficult to continue. Thankfully, Amy and I have a good understanding of Buddhism, and had read much about the area through our guidebooks.<br />
The Datsun itself is quite interesting. Because it was built only a little over a half century ago (and even then, the main temple burned down just before it initially was to open), most of the buildings are reminiscent of Soviet construction: big and stolid. Yet there is still a blending with Buddhist stylings, with all the statuary and stupas one would expect to find. Though here, they&#8217;re made of concrete and not wood or stone. The insides of the temples, though still Buddhist, borrow concepts from Russian churches (such as windows and high ceilings), a result of Russian influences on the Buryats when they tried to settle in the area.<br />
There were few other tourists there than ourselves, so we had a fairly easy time getting around. Although Ivolginsky Datsun is the centre for Russian buddhism, it&#8217;s not heavily visited at all times. There are strong ties here with both Mongolia (which is a very powerful buddhist centre, so I&#8217;ve learned) and, of course, Tibet.<br />
On the way back, we got to ask Ilyena a few questions. Well, to be most specific, Amy and I got to ask a few questions &#8212; Helga wouldn&#8217;t let up. To the point where she was outright challenging Ilyena about the differences between hardships under Soviet rule versus Helga&#8217;s post-war upbringing in the late 1940s &#8211; early 1950s. It was enough for me to bite my tongue &#8212; hard &#8212; and not suggest that Helga put a cork in it. It&#8217;s enough to ask questions, but an entirely different thing to disrespect your hosts by suggesting their troubles in life are trivial.<br />
We finally ditched Helga, and picked up our train tickets for tomorrow, and went off to explore the rest of Ulan Ude. Admittedly, there isn&#8217;t much else to see in this city, save for two museums that aren&#8217;t easy to get to. Across the road from our end-point was a nice opera theatre that looked almost like it had been plucked out from Spain. Next door to that was the Mongolian Embassy.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03587.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude and the opera house" width="300" /></a><br />
Down the road (to the south) was the GUM department store and market &#8212; of which there wasn&#8217;t much. However, there were <strong>delectable</strong> blinni &#8212; which are crepe-like packages filled with (in our case) cheese and ham. The pedestrian mall took us down to a recently-renovated church, before we walked back towards our hotel, and the world&#8217;s largest Lenin head.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03589.JPG" alt="Big dead Lenin and head and I" width="300" /></a><br />
Why is the world&#8217;s largest Lenin head in Ulan Ude? Got me. I can see it from this computer. It&#8217;s <em>HUGE</em>. It&#8217;s at least two storeys tall. The body, if there were one, would tower over Ulan Ude. Vlad-zilla!<br />
We&#8217;re preparing for tomorrow&#8217;s trip. Not just with supplies (food and water), but also mentally. Mongolians like to smuggle things across the border, and we need to be prepared for the possibility that they might try to muscle their way into our compartment &#8212; which we bought all the seats in to prevent us getting caught with smugglers.<br />
Either way, the next time you hear from us, we&#8217;ll be in another country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re in Ulan Ude now, having arrived a bit later last night than scheduled. (Mind you, it took a half hour to walk from the train to the hotel.)<br />
It&#8217;s a nice little city of about a half million &#8230; and no birch trees!!! <em>Finally.</em><br />
We&#8217;ll be here until <strong>early</strong> tomorrow morning, when we leave for Mongolia. I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to such an early morning, I&#8217;ll tell you.<br />
Slept mostly on the train, which was about the only way to pass through the pain. It&#8217;s a six and a half hour trip from Irkutsk to Ulan Ude, a distance of no more than 300 km (straight-line, that is). The train needs to take a few bendy twists going through the mountains, pass through a couple of tunnels, and then plods along at an agonizingly slow 50 km/h (estimated). I think we topped out at a few places around 80.<br />
The eastern shore of Lake Baikal was frozen &#8212; ice as far as you could see. The exact opposite of what we&#8217;d seen in Listvyanka two days ago. It looks like it&#8217;s thawing quickly, though, so it shouldn&#8217;t be long before the clear waters show through.<br />
Two of our housemates in Irkutsk (a pair of Aussies) told us two things: 1) that we&#8217;d love Mongolia (something we&#8217;d both strongly suspected), and 2) China would wear us down fast. It&#8217;s chaotic, the toilets are disaster areas (that actually scares us), the &#8220;queues&#8221; aren&#8217;t, and pretty much everything we&#8217;d wanted to see is buried under scaffolding. It seems everyone is upgrading this year.<br />
We&#8217;re just waiting for our tour to start today &#8212; we actually got a guide for here &#8212; and will be back later with more. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cold seems to be slowly moving away. It hit me a little harder than it did Amy, so while she dealt mostly with the sniffles, I&#8217;ve been dealt the ol&#8217; phlegm-attack. Mostly throat clearing, so it ain&#8217;t all nasty.<br />
Until today, I had yet to cash any of my traveller&#8217;s cheques. Useful things these are not. Major problem: very few places in Russia care to honour them. You have search high and low to find places that will handle them, and not for an obscene rate of conversion. It&#8217;s silly, really. In future, I&#8217;m sticking to my usual system: bring a bank card. It&#8217;s accepted at most ATMs world-wide, though you do sometimes have to hunt for the right ones.<br />
<span id="more-544"></span>After that, we got our visas registered for Irkutsk. It&#8217;s a leftover from the Soviet era, so far as I can understand. Basically, any place you stay overnight, you should have your visa registered by your hotel or by the registration office. What ultimate purpose this serves, I have no idea. All I do know is that if your visa isn&#8217;t suitably registered, and you don&#8217;t have all the paperwork, you&#8217;re likely to be buying out the border guard as you try to exit. Most importantly, as in our case, if travelling by train.<br />
Jack had double-booked himself for today, and had to take a group out of town on a three-day excursion (to where, I have no idea). He was supposed to take us to Listvyanka, a small town on the shore of Lake Baikal, about 60 kms away. Instead, he made arrangements with his friend Leonid (yes, like the meteor shower) to take us out.<br />
When I&#8217;d talked with Leonid last night, I had wondered what lay in store for us. Was he just a &#8220;friend&#8221;, or was there more of a professional association to him? (As Amy has pointed out, Leonid has his own company for this very thing. Normally, he does long-term fishing excursions, but made an exception for us.) He rolled up to Jack&#8217;s homestay almost exactly at noon &#8212; when he&#8217;d promised to be there.<br />
Leonid has a nice car &#8212; nice by Russian standards, definitely; nice by North American standards, pretty much. It&#8217;s a Toyota Mark II &#8212; Japanese model, so far as I can tell. (It was right-side drive.) The sound system was aftermarket, though, and was regularly playing Ivan Kupala &#8212; an artist reminiscent of Enigma and Delerium, except that he used the songs of old Russian women (singing old Russian songs) as the main part. Amy and I will be hunting for this CD, without question.<br />
After a short stop at the local DHL (despite packing light, this is the second batch of things Amy has sent home &#8212; keep in mind, however, that she did buy 10 balls of yarn in Kazan), we headed out on the sole road from Irkutsk to Listvyanka. It&#8217;s a rolling road, curving sometimes within sight of the Angara River, lined with birch, larch, and various coniferous trees.<br />
Our first stop, however, was not Listvyanka &#8212; it was the Museum of Wooden Architecture. Sounds kinda silly, I know, but museum is just like Heritage Park (in Calgary) or any other pioneer-esque recreation village showing the way life used to be here. But it&#8217;s not all about the stereotypical exiled-Russian-living-in-Siberia thing. This was about the Cossaks, the first Europeans to move to this region. How they built their forts to survive against the weather. And about the Buryats, decendents of the Mongols who settled here in permanent wooden gers.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03579.JPG" alt="The Museum of Wooden Arcitecture near Irkutsk" width="300" /></a><br />
The entire village is made of various buildings, most of which were brought to the museum before their original village locations (often many kilometres away) were flooded out with the damming of the Angara back in the 50s. The reconstruction is mostly complete, and gives a pretty clear idea of what life was like in this region of the world, 300 years ago.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03580.JPG" alt="Inside one of the buildings at the museum" width="300" /></a><br />
That&#8217;s the key difference between what we see at home and what&#8217;s here. The stuff we have in Calgary is rarely older than 150 years. This is twice that. The buildings are solid wood &#8212; mostly log houses (in various forms). Some are intricate, having several rooms, and separate buildings (for storage of grains and animals). There was a certain flow to everything.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03584.JPG" alt="Me, at the Museum of Wooden Architecture near Irkutsk (I gotta try to keep up with Amy!)" width="300" /></a><br />
Each building also had what Leonid called a &#8220;red corner&#8221;, which is supposed to be on the right side of the main room when seen from the door. This is what most would call a shrine. It depicts the Russian orthodox religion, and is a personal place of worship outside of the church. Leonid didn&#8217;t know why it was a &#8220;red&#8221; corner, though. I think it&#8217;s because the Russian word &#8220;Ã ºÃ‘â‚¬Ã °Ã‘ Ã ½Ã‘ &#8221; originally meant &#8220;beautiful&#8221; in English. Only today does it mean &#8220;red&#8221; &#8212; and the original meaning is lost in translation.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03581.JPG" alt="An example of a Red Corner; the museum screwed up and put it on the left side by accident" width="300" /></a><br />
From the museum, we continued down to Listvyanka. When we reached the mouth of the river, Leonid pulled his car over and told us a story about a rock that you can see in the mouth. The legend says that Lake Baikal has 340 sons, but only one daughter &#8212; the Angara River, the sole outlet of the world largest freshwater lake (by volume). The Angara flows into the Yenisey, and it&#8217;s said that the Angara wished to leave Lake Baikal to be with her lover. Lake Baikal refused and threw a stone to keep her from getting away. Today, it&#8217;s called the &#8220;shaman&#8217;s stone&#8221;. Angara got away, however, and Lake Baikal grew bitter and cold. It&#8217;s known for freezing over entirely, and for very nasty storms.<br />
Listvyanka is a town that was forgotten by the Soviet regime &#8212; or the town chose simply to ignore it. The entire village is wooden; the original part, anyway. Because of its proximity to Lake Baikal, many of the nouveau riche have bought up land and erected the most gaudy monstrosities you&#8217;ve ever seen. They look like someone tried to replicate a fairy tale castle, but used cheap bricks and garish pink paint.<br />
Ew.<br />
Lonely Planet (among various sources) recommended Listvyanka as a place to visit because it is reflective of an old Russian fishing village. It&#8217;s harder to see now, with the newer buildings (and a hotel under construction) that effectively ruin the charm. It was neat to see, but I imagine that within two years, Listvyanka won&#8217;t have the same appeal it did even a year ago.<br />
As we drove down the waterfront, we spotted ice washing up on shore. Leonid had told us that as little as three days ago (!), there was still ice on Lake Baikal in this area. Indeed, if you go further north, you can still drive across the lake &#8212; the ice will remain until well into June. The ice, combined with Lake Baikal&#8217;s ferocity, turned a wooden breakwater into near toothpicks a week ago.<br />
The pier was full of vendors. Some selling cheap (but expensive) souveniers, and lots of fish. The lake is full of fish and tends to be quite bountiful. And clear, so the fish likely taste quite good. We weren&#8217;t too keen on anything fishy today, though.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03586.JPG" alt="Me (with suitably dopey grin) at Lake Baikal" width="300" /></a><br />
We returned to Irkutsk, stopping only a couple of times for a last look at the lake, and for a nice photo op we noticed on the way back. It was a six-hour excursion, and both Amy and I would highly recommend calling Leonid if you&#8217;re in the area and need an excellent guide.<br />
Tomorrow, we head off for Ulan Ude. We&#8217;re nearly out of Russia and into Mongolia. Time is passing too slowly for me, though, as I want to get moving back towards home. As much as I love travelling, I really miss Alex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that feeling you get, when you&#8217;re finding yourself walking down a street in a dream, and you&#8217;re not sure if you know where you are, but you keep going anyway? That&#8217;s what Amy and I have been feeling like the last few hours. We&#8217;ve been speculating to guess why (I attributed part of it to being sick and drugged up on Contac-C; Amy&#8217;s blaming the fish she had for dinner last night), but we&#8217;re not entirely sure.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03574.JPG" width="300" alt="The Irkutsk railway station" /></a><br />
<span id="more-543"></span>We figure part of it is due to not knowing exactly where we were staying. Amy&#8217;d emailed Jack &#8212; our homestay host &#8212; only to receive not that he was out of town. Turns out he&#8217;s not, and it was an old notice. Before we&#8217;d found that out, though, we&#8217;d indulged ourselves in a little comfort food.<br />
Sushi. (We love the stuff.)<br />
It was the first time I&#8217;d ever been in a Japanese restaurant that didn&#8217;t have a single Japanese person working there. Bit of a switch, I have to say. The food was pretty good, even if I could only barely taste the pickled ginger (I hate being sick <em>(cough)</em>).<br />
We wandered around a bit, still in a daze, before we finally found a pay phone that took coins. Weird thing &#8212; almost none of the phones in Russia take coins. Almost all of them take phone cards. Which we don&#8217;t have, and aren&#8217;t even sure how to buy. The connection was lousy (it was an old phone &#8212; you dialed the number, inserted the coin, and then pressed a little button to make the coin drop when you finally connected with the other person), but we got enough information to find the building.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03575.JPG" width="300" alt="Yes, it's a camel. No, I don't know what it's doing in Irkutsk." /></a><br />
Just not the door. We had to call back from the internet cafe we were at this morning. That was much better, and we met Elena in the alley. Figured that it was the one door we didn&#8217;t try because we didn&#8217;t see the buzzer. Now we know better&#8230;<br />
I feel a whole lot better having finally found the place we&#8217;re staying for two nights. It&#8217;s going to be relaxful because there is no rush, no need to run to the next place. And no flotilla of security to prevent us from going wherever we want.<br />
We&#8217;ve been on the go, more or less, since we left Moscow. (Which, incidentally, was the last time I showered properly. I&#8217;m amazed Amy hasn&#8217;t passed out from the smell. I&#8217;m sure my pants are fully capable of sentience at this point.)  You have no idea how good it feels just to stop moving, even if just for a day.<br />
The place is nice, though you wouldn&#8217;t know from the stairwell. It&#8217;s even sketchier than Nord Hostel in St. Petersburg. The inside of the apartment is quite nice, and there&#8217;s a little cat (Fyodor, apparently after the writer) to entertain us.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03576.JPG" width="300" alt="Fyodor the cat" /></a><br />
Tomorrow, we&#8217;re off to Listyvanka, which is a small village on Lake Baikal, which is &#8220;traditional Siberian&#8221;, which means all wooden buildings. There&#8217;s a number of those here in downtown Irkutsk (pop. ~600k), but I imagine kept in better conditions.<br />
Until then&#8230; to rest, to sleep &#8212; perchance to dream&#8230;</p>
