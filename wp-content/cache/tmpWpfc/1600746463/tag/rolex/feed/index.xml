								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I arrived back in Costa Rica with my family in tow. Little did I know that my &#8220;other&#8221; family &#8212; my friends and colleagues back in Calgary, were facing quite the tragedy. I found out no sooner than I turned on my computer to send a quick note to my partners here in Costa Rica (remember, I have no phone with which to call them), and I got an IM request from Dave. All he said was: &#8220;Call me. Urgent.&#8221;<br />
It would appear that my friend, colleague, and fellow watch geek (though I could never ascribe to the level he attained) Sean Lineham passed away last night.<br />
<span id="more-1023"></span>Needless to say, I was shocked. It&#8217;s never easy to hear that a friend has died. It&#8217;s even harder when there seemed to be no warning. No chance to say anything, no opportunity to change the outcome.<br />
I can&#8217;t imagine how hard it must be for my old team back up in Calgary. Sean was a core part of the Rolex team, and was the heart of knowing all there was to know about watches. And since his switch to I&amp;P, he was the guy we bugged to figure out our next directions with technology. His enthusiasm and joy about the things we did were tangible at every moment. It is a terribly sad loss to lose that kind of energy.<br />
Farewell, Sean. May you find peace, and with luck our paths may cross again in this strange little universe.<br />
Here&#8217;s to you Sean!<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve been around a bit. You&#8217;ve been to Costa Rica, Honduras, Belize, Hawaii. You&#8217;ve seen a lot, but are finding the same problem again and again and again &#8212; everyone else has already been there. They&#8217;ve done it, so every time you want to go somewhere, your friends are blasé about the whole thing.<br />
I&#8217;m gonna let you in on a little secret. There&#8217;s a small country near the equator that an exceedingly small number of people go to for tourism. Business, yes. One city as part of a cruise, maybe. But visit? Hardly.<br />
<span id="more-1016"></span>I&#8217;ll lay hard cash that when you hear &#8220;Panama&#8221;, you think &#8220;Canal&#8221;. It&#8217;s hard to get away from that. It&#8217;s the single most famous part of Panama, and their single largest source of income (between $150k and $200k for each ship, and over 13,000 ships pass through annually). It&#8217;s an association they will never be able to break, nor are they even interested in trying. It would be like trying to disassociate the Eiffel Tower from Paris.<br />
An interesting fact: only 20% of all visitors to Panama actually come as tourists. The rest are all business travellers, who spend almost no money outside of their activities. (And most of those travellers&#8217; expenses are paid for by their <em>Panamanian</em> companies, meaning no additional money comes into the country.) Very few people venture beyond Cuidad de PanamÃ¡ (Panama City) or ColÃ³n (the Caribbean end of the Panama Canal, which has a large free trade zone and is quite popular for shopping). The rest of the country goes ignored.<br />
Which is a shame, really. There are nine indigenous tribes still in Panama, who still live by their traditional ways. They&#8217;re all fully aware of the modern world outside, and most even have some form of homestay, hostel, or room you can stay at. The rainforest here has barely shrunk as no-one usually bothers to log a forest (there is a rainforest within minutes drive of Panama City). There are almost 1,000 bird species.<br />
And how can you resist a hotel that looks like this:<br />
<a href="http://www.puntacaracol.com/"><a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2008/07/where-you-should-go-on-your-next-vacation/punta-caracol/' title='Punta Caracol'><img width="300" height="225" src="https://new.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/Punta-Caracol-300x225.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignleft wp-image-3249" alt="Punta Caracol" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alejandrotovar/2447863308/">Alex Tovar</a><br />
</a><br />
Guess how much a night? About $150/person (based on double occupancy). For a kick-ass cottage over the waters of the Caribbean. Can you go wrong?<br />
That&#8217;s the thing with Panama &#8212; it&#8217;s still cheap. Because so few people go there, it&#8217;s inexpensive. And it&#8217;s growing. Most of Panama is still pristine (eco-tourism is probably better &#8212; more &#8220;raw&#8221; &#8212; than even Costa Rica&#8217;s), and hotels are only now slowly being built.<br />
That&#8217;s part of the emphasis, too: &#8220;slowly&#8221;. Something we learned from talking with Rubén Blades (who is the Minister of Tourism) &#8212; Panama isn&#8217;t looking to grow overnight. They know what happened to Costa Rica. They don&#8217;t want such rapid growth that the infrastructure ends up being a disaster. Panama also knows that you can&#8217;t build with the expectation of people arriving all at once &#8212; you need slow, controlled growth.<br />
The growth is coming, but for now it&#8217;s all small numbers. Boutique-style hotels, hidden places that no-one&#8217;s seen probably for a thousand years. We joked that the only thing Panama doesn&#8217;t seem to have is a pyramid. (Sr. Blades joked that he tried to get one, but his counterpart in Belize said only if Panama would trade for the Canal.)<br />
And then there&#8217;s the shopping. One of the weird things of Panama is that it has excellent shopping. You can find deals virtually everywhere, and can get almost anything. For example, are you looking for a Rolex Daytona? You can get them here, easily. Even in stainless steel. Saw one myself. Five year waiting list? Not if you go here, first, my friend.<br />
We went to a mall that might as well have been from Las Vegas, for all the big name brands we saw. And I don&#8217;t mean box stores &#8212; there are no Wal-Marts, Costcos, or Home Depots here. I mean Armani, Cartier, FCUK, and Lacoste (which seems really popular here) to name but a few. And if you take the train out to ColÃ³n (a route I recommend only because the view is (probably) spectacular, and you don&#8217;t have to drive yourself), you can go to the largest free trade zone after Hong Kong. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s a shopper&#8217;s heaven.<br />
Want to find a super-cool place to live in an old part of an old city, but can&#8217;t seem to afford the rates in other places? Check out the Old Quarter of Panama. It&#8217;s screaming for gentrification. It&#8217;s started already, but the prices are still very low compared to other similar places in the world, and you just can&#8217;t beat that Spanish Colonial style. Besides, you&#8217;ll not only Sr. Blades as a neighbour, but also the President of Panama.<br />
There is no doubt in my mind that I&#8217;m going back. I want to see more of Panama. Not Panama City, but the rest of the country. And I&#8217;m staying at a hotel on the water.<br />
Depends who gets there first. You, or the rest of the world.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For all intents and purposes, I&#8217;m off the Rolex team. I&#8217;m still on their resource sheet, but the reality is that I haven&#8217;t done sqwat with the Rolex account for over a couple of weeks now. It&#8217;s all been transferred to Torin, who&#8217;s the new Tech Lead. I went into self-imposed exile at the fringes of the team&#8217;s seating space, soon to be a long-distant memory.<br />
But before I left, I had a debt to settle. Many months ago now, I had to institute what we called the &#8220;Jugo Juice Rule&#8221;. It was an effort to get everyone to calm down a bit (we were all under a lot of pressure, and mistakes were becoming more frequent) and concentrate on what they were doing. Short version: If you made a mistake, you owed the entire team Juge Juice (a fruit smoothie).<br />
<span id="more-999"></span>It was pretty simple. Until Tim called me out:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we don&#8217;t make any mistakes, do you owe us Jugo Juice?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, hell, why not? If I&#8217;m willing to institute a penalty, I&#8217;d better damn well be ready to ante up with a reward, right? It&#8217;s only fair, and incentive is always a good thing.<br />
We came close &#8212; once &#8212; to having the rule violated. In the end, however, no more mistakes were made (peace was restored to the valley) and we moved on. Except that I owed the team Jugo Juices. I even got their orders. But I could never get myself organised well enough to get them purchased and brought in. Add to that the logistical issue of the smoothies all melting before I got them to the office &#8230; and well the idea needed a bit of reevaluation.<br />
(Maybe in the future I&#8217;ll suggest they go for a Froster rule, since there&#8217;s a Macs about four blocks down, which is a perfect distance for the team to go on a break.)<br />
I refuse to leave this team with an unpaid debt. Instead of Jugo Juice, I offered lunch at the nearby Vietnamese place (although I had to buy Phil lunch in the Bistro due to food allergies; still, thanks for coming out anyway, Phil!). Not exactly on-par with cost, but I figured I owed them interest on the unpaid debt, and this was my last chance to have lunch with my old team. The next time I have lunch with a team, it&#8217;ll be over tamales, I think.<br />
It&#8217;s been a blast working with you folks. Try not to forget me too quickly, okay?<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the hard parts about leaving any group is passing your legacy off to someone else. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a short-term thing (e.g. vacation) or a long-term thing (e.g. leaving the company). It still has to happen &#8212; unless you&#8217;re a total jerk and want to leave people hanging, that is. It&#8217;s just how you carry it out.<br />
I&#8217;m on my second round of brain transfer in two months. The first time was when I was getting ready to go on vacation. I had to pass off my daily tasks to someone else so they&#8217;d get done. But you can&#8217;t easily toss one person&#8217;s work onto just one other person. Especially when you know there&#8217;s a lot to be done. A month ago, I used four people.<br />
This time, it&#8217;s just one. My replacement.<br />
<span id="more-964"></span>I&#8217;m still having issues with that word: replacement. I&#8217;m leaving the Rolex team here at Critical Mass. It&#8217;s hard. Really hard. Yes, I&#8217;m going to Costa Rica, and yes, it&#8217;s a pretty cool thing. But this team (the whole team, not just the developers whom I direct) has worked miracles over the last 2.5 years. They&#8217;re stars &#8212; all of them. I&#8217;ve seen the most amazing things done with the most insane requirements. I should know &#8212; I made some of those requirements. The team brought them to life.<br />
Anyone who thinks it was easy for me to decide to go to Costa Rica doesn&#8217;t understand what it&#8217;s like to be on this team. It&#8217;s almost a family within a family. You bond through adversity, and the challenges that we&#8217;ve put ourselves up to have done a hell of a bonding job. That, and the client is BAR NONE the best I&#8217;ve ever worked for.<br />
That&#8217;s hard to walk away from. It&#8217;s also hard to teach.<br />
Torin&#8217;s taking over. He&#8217;s getting his (long-overdue) promotion and starting his tenure at the Technology helm. I envy him in many ways. Notably that after over a year of working with RedDot, we&#8217;ve finally realised what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and the team has come up with a killer solution that delivers what we really need to make the site run the way we wanted it to run. It&#8217;s the start of another era, and I&#8217;m going to miss all of it.<br />
I&#8217;m a fan of setting people up for success, so my job now is to train Torin. I have to teach him 2.5 years of history, politics, technology, patterns, strategies, successes, failures, vendors, partners, and people so that he can walk in and not feel totally left out to dry. It&#8217;s daunting. I&#8217;ve seen his head spin a couple of times already as I empty my brainpan onto the table.<br />
It&#8217;s scary, actually. I can&#8217;t believe how much I&#8217;ve learned over the last 2.5 years. I worry if I can do Torin justice by teaching him enough. But it&#8217;s do or die time &#8212; either I succeed, or he won&#8217;t (as easily, anyway).<br />
There are times when I wish I had an assistant who did nothing but write down what I know. Man, would that ever make life easier&#8230;</p>

				<description><![CDATA[The flight left Charles du Gaulle at 11:30.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The flight left Charles du Gaulle at 11:30. That meant, of course, that I had to be there in sufficient time to check in, get through security, find the flight, and so forth.<br />
Thankfully, I&#8217;d gone through the trouble last night of finding the RER station at Chatelet-les-Halles. As is turns out, it&#8217;s a weird sort of situation. Chatelet is the Metro station. Les Halles is an ex-market area. Chatelet-les-Halles is a station almost mid-way, pretty much right under my hotel, actually. So there was a fair bit of walking to get there and back. Which was fine, no biggie. It was still cheaper than taking a cab.<br />
Albeit a lot more packed. While my trip in on Monday was blissfully free of people, the train was nearly full leaving Chatelet-les-Halles. When we left Gare du Nord, it was standing room in some places. The only stop after that was the airport. It&#8217;s effective public transportation, I&#8217;ll give you that! (Canadian airports and cities, please take note!)<br />
No elevators this time to slow me down. Just a really long lineup for Lufthansa. It took nearly 45 minutes to weave my way down to a clerk. I had a bit of a terrific thought as I waited. Technically, my flight is Air Canada. What if I had to go to the Air Canada counter? They&#8217;re not even in the same terminal. My only consolation was when I&#8217;d verified my flight this morning, the Lufthansa website told me my seat assignment. I could only hope that it also covered my Air Canada seat from Frankfurt to Calgary.<br />
Fears bubbled away as the rather cheery clerk (given the insane volume of people) jokingly suggested that my flight was cancelled and that I had to stay in Paris indefinitely. Admittedly, I was briefly tempted to believe him. But the rest of me quickly kicked in &#8212; I wanted to go home. I spent about 1/10th the time at the counter as the previous couple. Bag checked, boarding passes for both flights in-hand, I headed for Satellite 6.<br />
That&#8217;s the way Terminal 1 is broken up: a central hub with seven satellite areas for boarding planes. And sadly, that&#8217;s about literally all there is at Terminal 1. It&#8217;s devoid of almost everything else. It&#8217;s probably the dullest terminal I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of waiting around in for an hour and a half. (I prefer to wait in airport terminals, rather than rushing. Too many variables that could lead to a missed flight.)<br />
I had planned my Euro spending carefully, having only barely enough to pay for a muffin at a small cafe in the waiting lounge. That was fine with me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t want to go home with extra change. Still, I would have liked a ham and cheese baguette.<br />
Like the train out, the flight out was also full. Although I had an exit row, I was seated next to a woman who clearly did not fit in her chair (or really give her late-teenage son any credit for anything). I think this is partly what led to a rearrangement of seats. She was moved to the front of the plane, and the couple across the aisle were bumped a row up. The staff didn&#8217;t say why, but since I was allowed to remain and thinner people were placed in the now-vacant aisle seats next to me, I can only assume it was to ensure that the exit aisles could be cleared quickly.<br />
I passed out from exhaustion moments after the plane left the ground. I awoke only when the attendant happened to rather loudly plunk ice in a plastic cup. I was thankful for this &#8212; I got my cheese sandwich on dense German bread and a Coke. That would keep me going until I got my meal on the trans-atlantic flight.<br />
Virtually retracing my steps through Frankfurt to find my next flight (including the 700 metre-long tunnel), I rushed along just in case there was a lot of people at security. Given how heavy the airport traffic was, I didn&#8217;t want to risk holding things up. As it stands, I didn&#8217;t have to pass through security this time &#8212; just passport control. While not the speediest passing through, I was asked no questions. Stamp, done.<br />
Just past passport control was my gate, so I suddenly found myself with almost an hour to kill. Boarding would start soon, but my seat row meant I would be among the last called. Not a big deal, and far more comfortable as I wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to a jet engine the entire flight.<br />
My rowmate (I love the outside row &#8212; only two seats) was an oil driller from Oman, travelling back to his home around Great Slave Lake or something to visit family. He&#8217;d been flying already for about 20 hours. I couldn&#8217;t believe that level of stamina. I think I&#8217;d lose it after that long, personally. (I want to go to Australia someday, but the flight worries me a little.) He started chatting with me almost barely five minutes after sitting down. So much for a quiet flight.<br />
Actually, that&#8217;s not fair. He was an interesting person, having seen a great deal more than I have. And made me feel pretty damned petty about my mere 35 degree woes. Where he worked, it was 55 Celsius, not counting the blowing sand. He slept most of the flight, too, likely due to exhaustion.<br />
The flight was mostly uneventful. Some bouncing around (though we had a nasty approach to Calgary due to strong winds), the movies were there and the food was decent. I plugged away at getting these blog entries caught up. And I slept, even if just a little. While I hadn&#8217;t been flying for 20 hours before this one, I was still wiped.<br />
My bag was #155 coming off the carousel at the airport. Typical. Pass through customs, and waited to be picked up. Surprisingly not tired, I fully expect to pass out tonight.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No crepes for me this morning. As I&#8217;m beginning to discover, the French don&#8217;t consider crepes a breakfast thing. At least at the shops near the hotel. But hunger knows no bounds and I was forced to hunt out an alternative. The hotel clerk misdirected me to a boulangerie (that wasn&#8217;t there), but I managed to find a small grocery store on the way back to the hotel. A warm baguette and a chunk of a somewhat smelly cheese made for a pretty decent breakfast. The leftovers should cover me for tomorrow as well.<br />
<span id="more-445"></span>At 9:15, Adam and I wandered over to the Eurosites building (at 55 rue du Rivoli) to meet up with Stan. Thankfully, Stan was already there &#8212; the walk took barely four minutes from the hotel door. Stan works at Datasia and has been hugely instrumental in getting the training set up. He organized the training centre, made sure all the hardware was in place, got the manuals printed, and coordinated pretty much everything I couldn&#8217;t. For some reason, I thought he&#8217;d be completely different from how I met him. Much younger, extremely well-spoken, and a snazzy dresser to boot! We talked briefly before I headed back to the hotel, leaving Adam to configure the computers for the training tomorrow.<br />
Eurosites supplies meeting rooms. This is mostly because some companies don&#8217;t have meeting rooms (Critical Mass has well over 20 of them in the Calgary office alone) and many of the hotels are without conference rooms. They also supply computers, projectors, and drinks and snacks to get through those all-days slogs.<br />
Adam needs to install RedDot on all the computers. I had thought installing on one computer and sharing that would be better, but Adam believes it&#8217;s possible. They&#8217;re all Windows XP systems though, and I remember the grief we had trying to install RedDot on our systems. Still, Adam is confident, and I&#8217;ll have to put my faith into his abilities. He&#8217;s said something about using VMware, so maybe that&#8217;ll solve the problem.<br />
I finished a batch of email at the hotel before meeting up with the crew around 11:00 in the lobby. Joanne and Erica arrived yesterday (and it sounds like Joanne&#8217;s flight wasn&#8217;t as much fun as mine); Mark arrived late this afternoon and missed all the fun. Jaime came in and the four of us adjourned to the cafe next door for coffee (and tea, for me) to go over the workflow that Adam and I came up with yesterday. We know it&#8217;s not final, but we&#8217;ve got meetings with Datasia this afternoon, and we need this so it&#8217;s easier to discuss with Datasia.<br />
We had a lunch meeting with Didier at Cafe Marly at 12:45 sharp, so we broke at 12:30 to get there in time. We assumed it was in walking distance. I also wanted to check in on Adam to see how he was doing. Stan, it seemed, as joining us, and told us that it was in the Louvre. Suddenly, I realized that I&#8217;d seen Cafe Marly last night when walking through the Louvre&#8217;s courtyards. I also realized that Jaime, Erica, and Joanne were wandering Rue du Rivoli not having a clue where this place was. It seems that the street numbers don&#8217;t necessarily match up, for whatever reason.<br />
Running into them along the way, the five us hustled over to the Louvre. We passed into through the eastern gate into the Cour Carree. Supposedly, this is one of Stan&#8217;s favourite places in Paris. I can certainly see why. We walked quickly into the Cour Napoleon and walked to the Richelieu Wing where we found Cafe Marly. Loic, one of the translation managers, met us on the steps. I recognized Didier&#8217;s voice before I actually saw him. Much younger than I had thought (he&#8217;s probably younger than me). The Datasia team is really impressing me, and I&#8217;m only just really meeting them.<br />
Cafe Marly is very nice &#8212; a wonderful view over the courtyard and the Louvre Pyramid. And the food is very French &#8230; even if there is the near-ubiquitous hamburger on the menu. Even in the shade, it was still hot. Sweat dripped down my back almost the entire time we were there. (Thankfully, I&#8217;d had the foresight to wear an undershirt.) But despite the heat, it was still an excellent place to be for lunch.<br />
It was our first official meeting with Datasia, and I felt a bit of an idiot. I quickly realized that I was the only one at the table who couldn&#8217;t speak serviceable French. Erica is fluent (or at least awfully darn close to fluent). While Jaime isn&#8217;t fluent yet, she&#8217;s many kilometres ahead of me, and can carry on a conversation.<br />
We returned to Eurosites after lunch for the business end of the meeting. It was our first chance to discuss the translation workflow. I won&#8217;t bore anyone with the details, but there is something to be said for having these meetings face-to-face. You can have conversations over a phone or even over email and IM. But you can&#8217;t see someone&#8217;s reaction to an idea, you can&#8217;t judge someone&#8217;s thoughts if you can&#8217;t see their face. And yes, you could do this over video conferencing, but admittedly there is still a separation. I&#8217;m not saying that all meetings should be face-to-face, but if they&#8217;re important it definitely helps to fly 9.5 hours.<br />
After the meeting, we all returned to the hotel to get some work done. Mark arrived not long afterwards, but we had to wait for him to get to his place in downtown Paris. (The poor guy had flown from Ireland to Calgary, then turned around after a day &#8212; two at most &#8212; to fly all the way back across the Atlantic to Paris.)<br />
We met up with Mark outside of La Fumoir, a cafe across the street from the Louvre. (Didier had recommended it earlier in the day.) Despite the name (&#8220;the smoker&#8221;), it wasn&#8217;t actually that bad inside. One of the things I&#8217;m learning about Paris is that a lot of people smoke. It&#8217;s taking some getting used to. Which is to say I won&#8217;t get used to it. Problems with being a near-militant anti-smoker.<br />
Dinner in Paris is slow. There is no rush or pressure to eat. Dinner is a social activity and something that takes time. Food comes almost when the kitchen feels like serving it. And generally, people don&#8217;t inhale their meals, preferring to draw a simple appetizer out for as long as possible.<br />
While inside, massive thunderstorms rolled over Paris. Flashes from outside periodically brightened the dim interior for a brief moment. The temperature even seemed to drop a little inside the cafe, as the cooler outside air began to mingle. When we finally emerged around 23:30 (which was still early, at least by Parisian schedules), it was much cooler outside and a nice breeze made walking very comfortable. Even if the humidity was several points higher.<br />
I just finished wrestling with the uber-crappy wireless connection at the hotel. While free, which is nice, the wretched thing cuts out constantly. And there are times you can&#8217;t connect. I need to send emails back to Calgary to cover off things that I&#8217;m responsible for. Ain&#8217;t easy when you can&#8217;t get online.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m beginning to understand why people hate business trips. You can&#8217;t pack what you want (you have to pack for meetings with clients) and you don&#8217;t travel necessarily when you want. But at least the locations can be interesting&#8230;<br />
The account I work on now is European. They&#8217;ve got a massive global presence and are very good to work with. They tend not to hesitate on monetary decisions (unlike most clients), perferring to get the image just right (and understandably so). So when they said that I needed to be present when they were trained with the new RedDot Content Management System, I wasn&#8217;t the least bit surprised when they said I had to fly to Paris.<br />
Yes, that Paris. France.<br />
<span id="more-443"></span>Clothes were going to be a bit of a dicey issue. First, Paris is extremely hot right now, thanks to a Europe-wide heat wave. According to the Weather Network forecast, it will be over 37 degrees Celsius on Wednesday (that&#8217;s 100 degrees Fahrenheit for you non-Metric types). And I have to be in a suit. I&#8217;m not looking forward to that. Thankfully Jaime (my account manager) suggested that golf shirts would be suitable as well. Alex was very kind in selecting some for me that should hopefully do the trick.<br />
The trick part of packing for client meetings is the length of the visit. I&#8217;m in Paris almost a week. A couple of days will be mostly on my own (or with the RedDot instructor), so I&#8217;m not too worried about dress on those days. When I&#8217;m with the client, however, that&#8217;s another issue. I need to make sure that I&#8217;m dressed appropriately, and that I&#8217;ve given myself enough variation to adjust to the dress code of the day. I had to haul out a suitcase I haven&#8217;t used in years &#8212; the only one I have for packing suits.<br />
That distraction did cause a few problems. First, I forgot my power adapter for European sockets. I wasn&#8217;t too happy about that. I was even less happy when I realized (sitting in the waiting lounge for the flight) that I&#8217;d also forgotten my iPod headphones. Just before a 9.5 hour flight. Colour me unhappy. Thankfully, the Duty Free shop sold power adapters (which I needed) and I picked a really cheap (in price and quality, sadly) headphones to get me through the flights there and back.<br />
Boarding, I sat in the wrong seat. Why, I don&#8217;t know. First time for me. And of course, when I had a plethora of things that I had to put away. The seat I was assigned to (an aisle) was occupied. Three girls were travelling together and one asked if I could take her seat so she could sit with her friends. I had immediate images of being wedged in the middle seat of a centre row next to a screaming baby. Thankfully, it was a two-seat row window seat, next to a cryobiologist from Edmonton. How&#8217;s that for a cool profession? (Yeah, I know, dumb joke.) I don&#8217;t think there was a single baby on the plane, actually. I didn&#8217;t hear one, anyway.<br />
I worked for the next few hours, in between the meagre meals. I find writing emails, especially to one&#8217;s boss, is much easier after a couple of beers. And at high altitude. Helped me sleep for about an hour, too. That helped, since the flight left at 18:30 and didn&#8217;t arrive until 03:30 or so (Calgary time, that is).<br />
We flew northish, crossing over the southern end of Greenland. I saw my first iceberg from about 37,000 feet up. The sun never set, due partly to the time of year and partly to the altitude &#8212; it remained reasonably bright right through the flight. At least until everyone closed their blinds for a couple of hours of rest. I had to sit back and rest then, too, as the entire cabin went dark. Overall, a much better flight than the one to England back in April &#8212; this gave us more than enough time to sleep, even if just a little.<br />
At Frankfurt Airport, I had just under 40 minutes to find my connecting flight. First, Frankfurt Airport is <em>huge</em>. Second, it&#8217;s really poorly labelled. I had to find Gate A36. In most airports that I&#8217;ve been to, it&#8217;s not a problem. In this one, it was a problem. I was told &#8220;upstairs and follow the signs&#8221;.<br />
Allow me to give you more specific instructions. Up the stairs, 300 metres down the corridor, down a short hall to your left, then turn around right and get in the Non-EU Resident line for customs. (Yes, I cleared in Germany. No French stamp for me.) The customs was a joke. The guard looked actually bored. Two questions: Where are you going? Business or pleasure? That was it. Literally. Nothing else, even when I said I was going on business! That elicits a half-hour interview with armed soliders when you try to go to the States! Once through there, down the stairs, following signs that say &#8220;Gates A1 &#8211; 19&#8221;, despite previous signs that said &#8220;A1 &#8211; 54&#8221;. Then through security.<br />
Once through security, turn right and walk past the customs lines for the &#8220;B&#8221; gates. This arcs around until you get to elevators that go down to the underground tunnel between the two terminal buildings. You can also take the stairs, which are far faster. Then you walk down a 600 metre long tunnel (with moving sidewalks and nicely lit, I must add) before reaching elevators on the other side. Then up (I took the stairs again) to the hallway, hang a left, and walk down another 400-500 metres of airway until you find your gate.<br />
Thankfully, the flight was delayed 30 minutes.<br />
Lufthansa runs a nice flight. It was barely a third full. And despite the relatively short flight (about 90 minutes), I got a drink, sandwich (cheese on dense German bread), and a little chocolate bar. Air Canada &#8212; take note of how your alliance partner treats their guests on short-haul flights! You could learn a lot from these guys!<br />
Charles du Galle Airport is huge. One of Europe&#8217;s largest. It took a fair bit of walking to get to the baggage carousel. It took even longer to find the way out. For reasons I don&#8217;t fully understand, Terminal 1 isn&#8217;t connected to the rail system. So everyone shuffles to Terminal 3 via shuttle bus. And the rail connection isn&#8217;t easy to navigate unless you&#8217;ve done your research a bit. And you stand in line for over a half hour waiting to get a ticket because the ticket dispensing machines need European Visa cards &#8212; North American ones don&#8217;t work. (Go figure.)<br />
The RER trains are regular, and the trip takes about 45 minutes to downtown Paris. Sadly, the trains are not well-kept. I would put them as the poorest condition of any train I&#8217;ve ridden anywhere in the world. The stench of stale urine didn&#8217;t help any, either. I&#8217;ve heard this happens, but was still amazed. The trip was punctuated by people begging for spare change.<br />
Chatelet-des-Halles (the stop after Gare du Nord) is the second-largest train station in the world after Shinjuku, Tokyo. On the surface, you&#8217;d never know. But underground, it&#8217;s a connection between several train and Metro lines. And it&#8217;s a zoo. Carrying my rather awkward bag all that distance was no fun at all, and I&#8217;m not looking forward to leaving that way (I have little choice, and given it&#8217;s proximity to my hotel, I&#8217;d be stupid to go elsewhere). It took 15 minutes just to get out of the station, it&#8217;s that big.<br />
Thankfully, that left me with a 30 second walk to my hotel. I was in my air-conditioned room mere minutes later, revelling in the fact that I was no longer melting in the 33-degree heat of the city. My shirt was soaked.<br />
I immediately had to call Jaime to make plans for the evening. Which meant calling international to her cell phone, despite the fact that she lives 10 minutes from my hotel. (I love technology!) I had until 19:30, when she&#8217;d be more free, so I went for a wander. After all, I&#8217;ve never been to Paris before!<br />
The HÃ´tel des Ducs d&#8217;Anjou is a five minute walk to the Seine and the Louvre, about 10 minutes to Notre-Dame, and mired in the middle of a lot of cafes. I can hardly complain about its location. I decided to walk to the Seine and decide where it would take me from there. It wasn&#8217;t long before I was facing the west facade of Notre Dame Cathedral. The square in front of it was full of people, most just sitting around, talking, and viewing the sites. I passed by, taking a closer look at the facade before moving around the south side towards the east end. Crossing the bridge, I came back across the bridge, returning to Place Notre-Dame. There I waited until the cloud that had been sitting in front of the sun finally cleared so I could get a nice picture in the sunshine.<br />
Returning to the south side (the Left Bank, I believe), I walked down the river, past the countless booksellers with their dark green display boxes until I reached Pont Neuf. I returned to the north side again and headed back to the hotel.<br />
Jaime was a bit late arriving due to her meetings and a non-exact idea of where exactly the hotel was. We were soon weaving our way through the many narrow roads that make up this area of Paris, trying to find the ideal cafe to sit and have our meeting. The first place was hardly what I&#8217;d had in mind (the menu listed &#8220;pork meat&#8221;, which even in French didn&#8217;t strike me as great). The second was much better.<br />
Sadly, our meeting didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. Namely that I nearly face-planted my dinner from exhaustion. A bed never felt so good before.<br />
