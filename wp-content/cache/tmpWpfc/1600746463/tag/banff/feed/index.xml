										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Monkey, you&#8217;re seven.<br />
Like, <em>seven.</em> I&#8217;m having trouble really saying that. It&#8217;s just weird that you&#8217;re so much older than I always feel like you should be. You&#8217;re growing up a little more every day, and flit between my little girl and &#8230; well, kind of an evil genius, really.<br />
And truly, both are awesome.<br />
<span id="more-3424"></span><br />
Okay, so let&#8217;s start with the obvious: Your birthday was two days ago, not today. We were all in Banff, enjoying ourselves. And by &#8220;we&#8221;, I am, of course, referring to the entire troupe: Mommy, you, Choo Choo, and myself, plus Auntie Cathy and Uncle Craig and your cousins, plus Nana and Auntie B. That was Auntie Cathy&#8217;s idea. Going up a mountain? That was Uncle Craig&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
So let me throw you my little perspective on this one.<br />
First off, neither you nor Choo Choo nor your cousins objected. Only Mommy did, and that was largely because Mommy wasn&#8217;t feeling terribly well. That left the rest of us (save for Nana and Auntie B, of course) to tackle the mountain. Sulphur Mountain, to be exact.<br />
That hike, by the way, is 5.5 km straight-line distance, running about 700 m straight-up. It&#8217;s not a tough climb, per se, but let&#8217;s remember that you young&#8217;uns are topping out at eight years old, and Choo Choo&#8217;s barely four and a half. (Never mind Uncle Craig, Auntie Cathy, and I, who are far from being spring chickens, with the latter two of us having office jobs and not being in very good shape.)<br />
Following a hearty (and filling) breakfast at Melissa&#8217;s across from our hotel, we drove up to the main parking lot, unloaded, and proceeded to start our climb. (Well, after Choo Choo <em>had </em>to stop to pick up a rock. She loves rocks. I don&#8217;t know why. But she wanted to carry a rock.)<br />
I will give you all massive amounts of credit for the fact that none of you said a thing for the first few switchbacks. (If anything, it was the grown-ups telling you to slow down and pace yourselves.) You were having fun, even enjoying it. I was worried we&#8217;d hear &#8220;can we go back now?&#8221; after only a few bends.<br />
In fact, I don&#8217;t recall any of you suggesting we head back. Of course, it could be that you were all pre-empted by us saying where we were on the trail, looking at how far you&#8217;ve come, keeping you moving, and so forth. But you did have your moments &#8212; you especially, Monkey &#8212; where you were pretty much done, and didn&#8217;t want to go another step. But, of course, we gave you no real option, either: you were almost at the top, and going back down was rather pointless.<br />
Still, at just over 90 minutes from starting, we all arrived at the top of a mountain. Which hugely impresses me. That&#8217;s not a quick hike for adults, let alone kids, and yet you did it pretty darned fast! And on your birthday!<br />
So, no, I&#8217;m not going to make you climb a mountain on your birthdays, though cool this was. With luck, however, this will end up being the start of a better trail habit for all of us. And maybe &#8212; just <em>maybe</em> &#8212; you&#8217;ll like hiking a bit better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me, 2012 was a bad year. Between a host of medical issues (brutal chest cough that led to pulled muscles, to appendicitis, to strep throat, a couple nasty colds-cum-killer flus, and a minor outpatient surgery), ridiculous amounts of stress, the ever-present struggle of being a parent to young children, a general malaise, and an unfulfilled burning need to travel, it&#8217;s truly a wonder I got out of bed in the morning.<br />
So it wasn&#8217;t with any reservation that 2012 walked out of my life on Monday night, yet it still managed to leave me rather depressed. Sadly, 2013 woke me up looking already a lot like 2012, so I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m able to look at this new year with much hope yet. Instead, I suppose I shall have to try harder to make things work more my way.<br />
This not to say that I &#8220;didn&#8217;t like&#8221; 2012. It&#8217;s hard not to like an entire year in one&#8217;s life, especially one that brings so many new things to learn and experience. I just wish it hadn&#8217;t been so darned painful&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-3208"></span><br />
Like I said, 2012 was a busy, busy year. So there&#8217;s no way to know if I&#8217;m going to miss anything, because I did a pretty lousy job of documenting it. I can only hope that through extracting details from Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, and my blog, that I can stir enough memories to get this all straight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Experienced our first New Year&#8217;s Tea not at the Banff Springs</li>
<li>Learned that my youngest, Choo Choo (no more than 2), was a lot smarter than I thought she was &#8230; and she only got smarter (and more defiant)</li>
<li>Saw far too few friends for far too short a time</li>
<li>Worked a lot, but not painfully so &#8212; I still had a (family) life outside of it. YAY FOR BALANCE!</li>
<li>Developed a vicious cold that led to &#8212; no word of a lie &#8212; pulled rib muscles. Owie.
<ul>
<li>Had my first chest x-ray, taken by &#8212; drum roll, please &#8212; my wife, Alex!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discovered that Monkey loves shrimp, especially at dim sum</li>
<li>Didn&#8217;t go to dim sum nearly enough</li>
<li>Had some fairly steep automobile expenses (block heater for the Jetta, and a new car for Alex)</li>
<li>Renewed a mortgage for the first time ever (instead of selling the house)</li>
<li>Continued hating, loathing, and despising having to deal with the Facebook API</li>
<li>Went through the agony, grief, despair, anger, bargaining, and acceptance of a major home renovation, as we redid our kitchen (and subsequently, floors and bathrooms)
<ul>
<li>I do so love our kitchen, though&#8230;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Found my cooking skills steadily improving
<ul>
<li>Need to watch more cooking shows, and figure out some different techniques</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Broke my little toe. Why do the little bones always hurt more?</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time ranting about how badly our Federal Government seems to want to drive Canadians to be not Canadian (specifically through bills C-11 and C-30, the ever-present Big Telco lobbies, revisiting the abortion laws, and Rob Anders)</li>
<li>Disposed of my giant water jug container of coins (6,400+ of &#8217;em)</li>
<li>Realized that building a &#8220;mobile&#8221; site is a pointless exercise, and that the design needs to adapt for all devices &lt;&#8211; my professional epiphany of the year</li>
<li>Lived (very basically) out of my contractor&#8217;s rental home for a month while our home was being torn apart</li>
<li>Celebrated Choo Choo&#8217;s 2nd Birthday</li>
<li>Cancelled TV at home, and went to internet-only for video content (still a work-in-progress)</li>
<li>Saw the original cast of <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> on stage</li>
<li>Had my first ambulance ride, my first shot of morphine, and my first (and thankfully last) bout of appendicitis
<ul>
<li>Also had a sponge bath; nowhere near as much fun as it sounds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Saw <em>Avenue Q</em>. Hurt myself laughing.</li>
<li>Tried not to laugh when Monkey decided to cut Choo Choo&#8217;s hair. I failed.</li>
<li>Learned that I cannot work from home, without breaking my children&#8217;s hearts</li>
<li>Showed my children the &#8220;hole in the sun&#8221; as Venus transited our star &#8212; I think Monkey started to understand heliocentrism&#8230;</li>
<li>Exited the year wondering how RIM/Blackberry is still a going concern, and why Microsoft hadn&#8217;t fired Ballmer</li>
<li>Went to Fairmont Hot Springs</li>
<li>Went to Oakville</li>
<li>Went to Banff</li>
<li>Aaaaand that&#8217;s it, folks. Depressingly boring year for travel.</li>
<li>Turned 40. Or as I like to call it, &#8220;4, with an extraneous zero&#8221;.</li>
<li>Watched in real-time (delayed by 7 minutes) as Curiosity landed on the surface of Mars using the single most insane landing procedure ever conceived</li>
<li>Monkey became a 5 year old. I&#8217;ve been a parent for over <em>five years</em> now. And the world has not fallen apart (entirely). Who knew?</li>
<li>Tried to stop drinking coffee. Boy that was dumb.</li>
<li>Reminisced about being with the CBC TV 50th Anniversary project 10 years ago</li>
<li>Took Monkey to her first day of kindergarten; oddly, I didn&#8217;t cry</li>
<li>Accepted the reality that our family cannot operate without a second car</li>
<li>Made jam for the first time, and I shall do it again!</li>
<li>Made tomato sauce and tomato paste from scratch; there&#8217;s a reason they&#8217;re cheaper to buy in cans, sadly.</li>
<li>Made a &#8220;perfect&#8221; prime rib. Now I need to make it again.</li>
<li>Figured out how to make gluten-free stuffing for turkey (just need to tone down the spices a bit, as I discovered at Christmas)</li>
<li>Used a roto-tiller for the first time. Sadly, it had very dull blades, so using it hurt. A lot.</li>
<li>Felt my gut in my stomach as a man stood on the edge of the stratosphere. Then he jumped.</li>
<li>Somehow acquired strep</li>
<li>Got taken down, not by the strep, but by the stupid antibiotics I took to get rid of the strep. Go figure.</li>
<li>Had a very long night of trying to get my frozen, snow-bound car out of the airport parking lot.</li>
<li>Had a vicious cold knock me down for two days (minor flu?)</li>
<li>Got a re-learning of high school physics when I tried to vacuum up a box of baking soda. (Try it yourself, if you dare.)</li>
<li>Rode the new West LRT on the first day! Love that I take a train to work, now.</li>
<li>I saw <em>The Hobbit</em>. Yes, I liked it.</li>
<li>Had a minor outpatient surgery that didn&#8217;t exactly jingle my bells; made for an uncomfortable Christmas</li>
<li>Got an iPad mini for Christmas from my company. Had to admit that the Mini is actually a good idea.</li>
<li>Got (and installed) a Nest thermostat. I can&#8217;t stop fiddling with it.</li>
<li>Finally went sledding for the first time in two years.</li>
</ul>
<p>That brings me to the end of the year. So: busy, interesting, painful, trying, educational, somewhat wistful, and definitely productive. We&#8217;ll see what 2013 brings.<br />
I just hope it means no more trips to hospitals&#8230;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2013/01/new-years-tea-2013/gingerbread-banff-springs/' title='Gingerbread Banff Springs'><img width="300" height="224" src="https://new.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/Gingerbread-Banff-Springs-300x224.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignleft wp-image-3375" alt="Gingerbread Banff Springs" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/8334219425/">Geoff S.</a><br />
Every year, so far able to be said to be &#8220;like clockwork&#8221;, we have Afternoon Tea on New Year&#8217;s Day. So far, every time has been at a Fairmont hotel (three times at the Banff Springs, once at the Hotel Vancouver), and I don&#8217;t suppose that tradition is likely to change any time soon. Though we&#8217;re definitely needing to branch out to other Fairmonts, and my sights are definitely set on the Empress in Victoria.<br />
This year&#8217;s event was quieter, being just the four of us. Whereas last year we had more guests than the combined attendance of all previous NYTs, we intentionally kept it light and simple.<br />
In fact, this year&#8217;s annual Tea almost didn&#8217;t happen.<br />
<span id="more-3207"></span>Monkey is now 5, and she&#8217;s doing what five year-old kids usually do: test their parents, find the holes in their armour, and attack mercilessly until they collapse in a pile of weeping sorrow. (Honestly, it&#8217;s a wonder that the human race has survived, given children&#8217;s propensity to drive their parents nearly to genocide&#8230;)<br />
Add this developmental stage to the delirium brought on by the new toys at Christmas and &#8230; well, &#8220;fire and gasoline&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really bring out the volatile situation, but you can get an idea. Adjustments have come in various forms (and is still on-going); one of them was a proposed cancellation of the annual Tea. We were more than a little concerned about behaviour not just in a restaurant, but in a High Tea environment.<br />
I didn&#8217;t want to cancel it, even though I was the one who proposed it. I love New Year&#8217;s Tea. I love Afternoon (or High) Tea, and have had the luxury of having in several different countries, now. I was not looking forward to <em>not</em> going, and it actually hurt to suggest that we shouldn&#8217;t go.<br />
Nevertheless, Monkey availed herself to recant (some of) her behaviour, which gave us enough faith to believe that we could make this work. (Choo Choo, not yet 3, has some education before her as well, but being young and painfully cute, has a way of getting away with things more readily.) So, we hurriedly packed up, and pressed out for Banff late this morning.<br />
The first day of the New Year was bright and sunny, with the temp just below zero. Snow was still covering everything, and while the sun had melted the snow from the pine trees in most areas, there were still the stereotypically winter-white patches on the fringes once we got into the Rockies, in places the sun could not reach.<br />
Banff was busy, busier than I can recall for any previous trip, but busy in a way that lent a wonderful energy. I would have loved to have gotten out of the car and walked up and down Banff Ave. a bit, if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that we were in a hurry. Despite leaving early enough, we somehow managed to arrive with only minutes to spare for our reservation.<br />
Sadly, we were not near a window &#8212; a first for us, and I think affected the kids a bit; they were a bit antsy to eat. The waitstaff was typically wonderful, and we were quickly set up with our teas, and confirmed the trays that were to come out.<br />
The egg salad croissants didn&#8217;t sit well with either of the kids, nor did the watercress (though that didn&#8217;t surprise me in the slightest). Peanut butter and jam were gone in seconds. Monkey loved the (absolutely delectable) creme brulée, but Choo Choo couldn&#8217;t really get into it. In fact, Choo Choo didn&#8217;t really eat much of the stacks, except for the scone (lathered in strawberry jam). Monkey ate, or at least tried, everything, and even had a second scone.<br />
But the antsiness continued, and it was clear before long that Choo Choo wasn&#8217;t going to sit still for much longer. Monkey, for her part, did exceptionally well.<br />
We headed out, and then up Sulphur Mountain to the Upper Hot Springs for a dip in the pool. It was, like the rest of Banff, quite busy, but not uncomfortably so. The water, however, was very comfortable, and lovely to rest in. We stayed no more than 15 minutes, mostly due to Choo Choo making a rather sudden dash across the shallow kiddie portion of the pool, aiming for a ladder into the deeper section. (One mother near me commented: &#8220;Wow, she&#8217;s fast!&#8221;) The swim was over.<br />
Choo Choo, the Great Fighter of Nap Time,  was asleep before we got back on the highway for home.<br />
I think this year will be the closest we ever come to not having New Year&#8217;s Tea, barring an emergency of some kind, as this will be the last year that I have wavering faith in my children&#8217;s behaviour. Next year, Monkey will be 6, and a perfect angel (right, Monkey??), and Choo Choo, though 3, will be learning much from her sister on how to behave well (right, Choo Choo??).<br />
I needed today. I honestly did. The drive out of Calgary alone was worth it, as was the time in the mountains, however short it was. I ain&#8217;t saying I&#8217;m ready for this year to begin yet &#8212; I&#8217;ll be writing &#8220;2012&#8221; for a while, I&#8217;m sure &#8212; but we at least got it off to a good start.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sit here at my kitchen table, rubbing the weariness from my eyes. Not the things you&#8217;d normally hear from me, mind you &#8212; I haven&#8217;t been working too hard as of late (as you know, my big project is done). No, this is from something much better &#8212; spending time with my family, and notably you, Monkey.<br />
The last four days have been a lot of fun. Maybe even too much fun. Both of us are pretty pooped. You went to bed and for the first time in a long while, there wasn&#8217;t hours of chatter from your room. I think you pretty much passed out. I won&#8217;t be too far behind you, I think, but I do wish to describe the fun that we&#8217;ve shared.<br />
&#8216;Cuz, frankly, I&#8217;m not sure how the heck I survived it all&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-2688"></span>First off was Canada Day. This year, Mommy and I decided to try a visit at Heritage Park. If you got there early enough, you got a free pancake breakfast. It seemed like a fun thing to do. And it probably would have been more fun if it had been a few degrees warmer &#8212; it was rather chilly for the first day of July.<br />
Still, you had a lot of fun. Once we&#8217;d gobbled down the pancakes, we went and got ride tickets. You swung on a vintage ship-styled swing, rode the big steam train around the park, went on the paddlewheeler out in Glenmore Reservoir (although you barely stopped moving the entire time, necessitating me following you around the entire time), and went on the merry-go-round (you demanded to ride the white horse).<br />
You ate a pretzel, and drank some frozen lemonade with me. We saw the farm animals (you mooed at the cows, and nearly had your bright red Crocs eaten by a misguided horse). Then we went through Gasoline Alley. By this point, you were tired and got fairly cranky, so we all opted to go home.<br />

Mommy wanted to go visit with Grandpa for a week, and had to take Choo Choo with her. (Choo Choo&#8217;s still nursing, so she goes wherever Mommy goes.) But &#8230; well, Monkey, all me to be rather honest for a moment &#8212; travelling with you lately requires a lot of high-test drugs to keep people calm. Either you or us, it doesn&#8217;t matter. But Mommy travelling with you and Choo Choo wasn&#8217;t even discussed as an option, and Mommy really wanted to go without all of us in tow. (You&#8217;ll understand this years from now, when you have a near-3 year old.)<br />
Of course, what all that means is, it was just you and me, kid. And we got off to it before Mommy and Choo Choo&#8217;s plane had taken off.<br />
Our first stop was the Galaxie Diner on 11th St., not far from Grandma&#8217;s house. There we enjoyed a filling breakfast, because we had a long day of chasing trains ahead of you. I hadn&#8217;t chased a train since before you were born, and I was itching to go out and take pictures. I figured you might like to see a big train in motion, and when my friend Graham told me CP 2816 was going out to Banff on 2 July, I couldn&#8217;t resist.<br />
After breakfast, we went home just long enough to get a few things together (like my camera), and then we went searching for our first place to wait. I originally thought of a place known as Keith, which is roughly where Stoney Trail crosses the Bow River. But as we came down Sarcee Trail towards the highway, I spied an even better location: where the train tracks cross 32nd Ave NW. It would give me an easy access for photography, a decent backdrop, and not far from the highway to get back out again.<br />
We ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked. One thing you&#8217;ll learn, kiddo, is that when you chase trains, you have to be patient and wait. A lot. Even though Graham was sending me text messages on the train&#8217;s status, it didn&#8217;t come quickly. We saw a freight train have to wait for CP 2816, too. But eventually, we got the note that she was heading west. Before long, we could hear its whistle echo through the valley. It came towards us, barrelling along as fast as it could, belching out black smoke.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762469809(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4763109230(square)[/flickr]<br />
For a moment, I saw myself in you. When I was your age (maybe a little older), your granddad (my daddy) used to take my family (Nana, Auntie Cathy, and me) to the train tracks near our house, to watch another steam locomotive &#8212; CN 6060 &#8212; come racing by, huge clouds of black smoke filling up the sky. It used to scare the hell out of me. Of course, I look back at that now and I feel really glad that I did see that &#8212; it&#8217;s a fond memory. I hope maybe one day, it is for you, too.<br />
We hit the road and headed out to a place out towards the mountains called Ozada. You were asleep before we were outside city limits, and slept all the way there. Ozada is on the Stoney Indian reserve, and is one of Canadian Pacific&#8217;s old stations for servicing steam locomotives. (The concrete pylons for the coaling and water towers are still visible.) Today, it&#8217;s little more than a siding in the middle of nowhere, just off the highway. And we waited there because Graham had told me CP 2816 would be stopping there for servicing as well.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762477071(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762477937(square)[/flickr]<br />
We were not disappointed. We saw the train come in slowly, pass by, and stop in the siding. After it had passed, we drove to the other end of the siding, and watched it race westward. (The train was about two hours late, so they had a reason to move quickly.) We drove out to the highway, and saw the train&#8217;s smoke as we drove by it on the highway. We saw some other people we&#8217;d seen back in Calgary stop at the side of the highway to take more pictures.<br />
Finally, we stopped in Banff, and waited about halfway between the station and Bankhead. We had to wait a long, long time before we saw CP 2816&#8217;s lights. As CP 2816 was going on show at the station, the train stopped again not far from us for one last servicing before going in. This gave us a fantastic view, although the whistles did give you a bit of a scare &#8212; they were quite loud.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762480609(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4763119200(square)[/flickr]<br />
After meeting up with Graham at the station (it seemed only fair to thank him in person for the information), we had lunch at Bruno&#8217;s, and then headed back to Calgary. You slept from Canmore all the way home.<br />
On Saturday, you and I went to the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market, mostly so you could go to the jumping castle &#8212; probably your most favourite thing in town (after me, of course). You ate your mixed berry crepe almost as fast as I could eat my ham and cheese crepe. I swear it&#8217;s the only thing you eat quickly &#8212; everything else requires a pry bar and a shovel&#8230;<br />
When I asked what you wanted to do next, you said: &#8220;I want [to see the] giraffes!&#8221; So off we went to the zoo. We went though the dinosaurs, then over to the giraffes, zipped by the gorillas, and spent a lot of time at the playground (you love the playground, there). Then it was into the Australian  pavilion  (I was devastated to find that the nocturnal animal area is permanently closed), through the monkey house, and then over to the elephants (where we had hot dogs), zipped over to the carousel (just opened), before going through the Canadian Wilds (where you were completely obsessed with the prairie dogs).<br />
[flickr]photo:4763125998(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762491661(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762511327(square)[/flickr]<br />
For dinner, I took you to a Japanese restaurant. I found that your chopstick skills had degraded quite a lot &#8212; we&#8217;ll have to work on that. But you ate half of the edamame, a couple of avocado rolls, and even a piece of hamachi sashimi (well, it was nigiri sushi, but it was just plain easier to give you just the fish). You wouldn&#8217;t touch the miso soup (I&#8217;ll work on that, too). For your first shot, I was very proud of you.<br />
The next morning, we walked over to the #2 bus stop. You were ecstatic about riding the bus. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s from singing <em>The Wheels On The Bus</em> so much.   We went to the Silver Dragon restaurant, where we met up with my friend Tamara and her husband, Dan. There we ate dim sum (Mommy was rather annoyed that we went without her). It was so good. You ate buns, and pork dumplings, and quite a lot of deep fried squid. Yes, you ate squid. I kid you not. Mind you, as I&#8217;ve said to others, the squid tastes a lot like scrambled eggs. So I told you it was scrambled eggs. You couldn&#8217;t get enough.<br />
Following dim sum, you and I walked along the river over to Eau Claire Market (which really isn&#8217;t a market anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s mostly businesses and empty store space &#8212; nothing like it used to be), where you and I saw Toy Story 3. I cried a bit. You seemed to like it a lot, though. Especially anything with Woody.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762516489(square)[/flickr]<br />
In fact, you like Woody and Jesse (the Yodelling Cowgirl) so much, and because the Calgary Stampede is just around the corner, we walked over to Stephen Avenue afterwards to try and get you a cowgirl outfit. You&#8217;ve got the boots and jeans, but you need a hat and a shirt. Sadly, we were less than successful &#8212; no-one seemed to have a cowgirl shirt in your size.<br />
On the way home, much to our luck, we ran into Grandma on the bus (she was coming to our house, anyway &#8212; we just had really good timing). You had some fun with Grandma while I went off to get something for us to eat for dinner.<br />
In fact, I&#8217;m so tired from all of this excitement that it&#8217;s taken me a while to write all of this. But I hope you had fun, Monkey. I know I did.<br />
And now, I need to go to bed. &#8216;Cuz I&#8217;m really, really, <em>really</em> tired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New Year is always a reason for change. It&#8217;s always a reason to do something differently than you&#8217;ve done before. It&#8217;s a time when people hold to ages-old traditions, and make efforts to start new ones. It&#8217;s a time to look back on the past, and look towards the future.<br />
And frankly, it&#8217;s a darn good reason to make a little trip out to Banff to see old friends.<br />
<span id="more-2498"></span>Internet phenom Twitter really hit it big in 2009. (I would like to say I knew about Twitter from the beginning, but held off on getting account until the Web 2.0 conference in 2008.) Coincidentally, it was a time when many other people joined Twitter, bringing it to the masses and making it the media darling it has become.  It also allowed previously ordinary people and/or small groups to become much more visible on a person-to-person level.<br />
This is how I came across my old friend, <a href="http://sonnyjelinek.posterous.com/">Sonny Jelinek</a>.<br />
Sonny and I go way back. And I mean &#8220;way&#8221; as in &#8220;preschool&#8221;. We both went to St. Cuthbert&#8217;s preschool, back in the mid-1970s. We went to the same kindergarten, elementary, mid, and high-school. We were on the same soccer team (his family&#8217;s company was the sponsor). We were in the same Cub Scout troop. We were even on the same swim team in high school.<br />
And then, like everyone else in high school, we dropped off each other&#8217;s radar for nearly two decades. It was for no other reason than everyone going their own way. Sonny&#8217;s way took him further out of the circles the rest of us migrated into &#8212; I periodically traipsed across others &#8212; taking him as far as southern California.<br />
He now heads up his family&#8217;s business &#8212; <a href="http://www.jelinek.com/">Jelinek Cork</a> &#8212; and is the chair of the Oakville Chamber of Commerce. Considering he&#8217;s (about) the same age as me, that&#8217;s not anything to sneeze at. Compared to him, I have to admin that I do feel a little inadequate.<br />
Through Twitter, Sonny and I exchanged not just greetings, but found out that we were going to be in close proximity to each other. He and his wife Michelle were coming out to Banff for New Year&#8217;s, which seemed an opportunity that we simply couldn&#8217;t pass up.<br />
Instead of the old standby &#8212; drinks at some bar &#8212; I suggested we do something a little different: <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/banffsprings/GuestServices/Restaurants/AfternoonTea.htm">Afternoon Tea at the Banff Springs Hotel</a>.<br />
The Banff Springs, like the other Fairmont hotels, carries on the traditions first held when they were Canadian Pacific hotels, founded by Scotsmen who had the tradition of British high tea. If you&#8217;ve never had high tea, it&#8217;s something I highly recommend. And if you get a chance to do so at a Fairmont hotel, you&#8217;ll be experiencing some of the best in the world. (I can say that, having had tea in a few places outside of North America.)<br />
We arrived in the Rundle Lounge around 13:45, the time Sonny had managed to reserve. It didn&#8217;t matter than we hadn&#8217;t seen each other in over 18 years &#8212; the time seemed to nearly vanish. We looked older, wiser, and (hopefully a lot more mature), but recognition came pretty quickly for both of us. Spouses and The Monkey were introduced.<br />
First question? After graduation, what happened next?<br />
We had our tea for nearly three hours. That&#8217;s how good a time we had. Our servers wafted in and out like the scent of tea from the pots we drank, neither interrupting nor competing for attention. The trays of scrumptious sandwiches and cakes were more than we could eat (I think they&#8217;ve actually gotten better since our last time) &#8212; The Monkey had an entire tray all to herself.<br />
My biggest regret with the event was something that many of you will find shocking: I utterly forgot to take a picture. I only realised it as we drove away from the Banff Springs, headed back to Calgary. Quite the oversight, sadly.<br />
Alex and I remarked as we headed down the Trans Canada that having tea on New Years Day seemed special for a few reasons, not the least of which was having tea with old friends. But it&#8217;s a nice event. It&#8217;s quiet, peaceful (except for having to chase The Monkey all over the place, as she&#8217;s rapidly becoming a poster child for Ritalin), and thoroughly enjoyable way to bring in the new year. (Probably even moreso if you&#8217;re still recovering from the previous night&#8217;s events.)<br />
Alex and I have declared this to be our new tradition: New Year&#8217;s Tea. We&#8217;ll be there, a year from today, enjoying the fantastic view, and having a wonderful time.<br />
Who wants to join us?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This weekend, it was my turn to be surprised. And surprises came in droves.<br />
Sunday was my 34th birthday. I find it a little hard to believe that I&#8217;m actually that old. I always figured when I was in my 30s, I&#8217;d be more &#8230; mature. And yet I find myself being more immature with each passing year. I guess I&#8217;m holding to my pattern &#8212; 18 years old, with a heap of experience. For now, I think that&#8217;s a good thing. Experience helps, and one can&#8217;t get too mature. You lose all the fun, after all!<br />
<span id="more-441"></span>I sprinted home from work. I can bike home now almost as fast as I used to drive. I can&#8217;t quite figure out how I&#8217;ve done that, but I can&#8217;t really complain, either. It&#8217;s a good thing. Except that damned 8th Street hill. It&#8217;s just evil. It&#8217;s not as bad as other hills in town I have to say, but it still sucks the life out of you.<br />
Following a shower, Alex packed me in her car, and off we went. Destination unknown. Quite literally. This weekend was my chance to be surprised. I don&#8217;t ask questions, though &#8212; I prefer to try and guess to myself. The process is usually pretty simple elimination. I can eliminate quite a large number of things without much effort. Alex, of course, knows this. So she makes sure to keep me guessing.<br />
Our first stop was Banff. Dinner. Nothing serious. Kind of an eat-and-run thing. The Wolf Street Grill completely ignored us, so we tried some Japanese place a couple of blocks away. (The sign out front, in Japanese, solicited a great deal of laughter from Japanese tourists. I&#8217;m now dying to know what it says.) We ate quickly before heading back to the car and our exit.<br />
Although we ended up making one side-trip into Abomindable Sports. Sandal-searching. And I found something &#8212; Tevas. My previous pair of leather sandals was Teva, and I rather like them. I wanted something that wasn&#8217;t leather, though, since I wanted to be able to use these in wet conditions (among other things). Tevas ain&#8217;t cheap, though. But they fit, and they don&#8217;t hurt. That&#8217;s a tough thing to overcome sometimes. Tevas it was&#8230;<br />
We continued past Lake Louise and the Icefields Parkway turnoff (much to my relief), then over the Big Hill into Field, BC. Passing Field, we headed into the valley towards Golden. I was trying to figure out where we were going, and constantly drawing a blank. There was a faint hope that it had something to do with 2816, since I knew she was in the neck of the woods during the weekend. But beyond that, I hadn&#8217;t a clue.<br />
It seems that finally someone had the sense to start work on the Trans Canada highway east of Golden. It&#8217;s been a mess there for decades, and is generally difficult to go through. The hills are steep, the road windy, and there are a number of 40 km/h corners. The new section that they&#8217;re building, so it looks, will create a massive fly-over to reduce the cornering and hopefully twin the lanes. It&#8217;ll be a few years until it&#8217;s open though &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of work to do.<br />
Being the master of deception that she&#8217;s becoming, Alex really threw me off with a visit to the 7-11 in Golden before going a mere two blocks to the Travelodge for our motel room for the night. I had no idea what was going on. Thoroughly stumped.<br />
The next morning we were back on the road, following a brief stop at the Humpty&#8217;s for breakfast, we continued west. Why we were going to Revelstoke, I had no idea. We stopped briefly at the railway museum (but didn&#8217;t go in &#8212; next time, I need to actually go in there). I had heard about a trip from Revelstoke to Golden with 2816, and thought that maybe that&#8217;s what we&#8217;d gone there. (Alex had mentioned that we needed to be &#8220;there&#8221; for 13:00.) We hopped back in the car, though, and continued south.<br />
Now I was stumped. I have no idea what&#8217;s south of Revelstoke. As it turned out, not much &#8212; we were on the wrong road. We ended up having to double-back to the Trans Canada and continue west. I was beside myself with confusion. Where the hell were we going?<br />
Three Valley Gap. That&#8217;s when the surprise revealed itself. As we took seats in the restaurant there, there were settings for four, not two. Someone was going to meet us &#8212; but who? I couldn&#8217;t think of anyone who lived in the area. And that&#8217;s when Allen and Jean appeared. The sneaky trio (apparently mostly Jean&#8217;s doing) had completely orchestrated the charade.<br />
The four of us had a lovely (long) lunch, followed by a transfer of inheritances that Allen and Jean had brought from Ruskin. We&#8217;ve now got some of Christena&#8217;s things that she&#8217;d left to Alex. Oddly enough, with no planning at all, they seem to fit with our house.<br />
Naps were next. Well, for three of the four of us. Not yet being tired, I went wandering with my camera. I was lucky enough to catch a west-bound coal train (the Canadian Pacific line runs right past the hotel), though I botched the timing and the train&#8217;s a bit blurry. Things to remember for the next time I try that. Fortunately, the other trains I shot don&#8217;t move.<br />
Three Valley Gap is the oddest place you&#8217;ll ever see. It&#8217;s very much a work in progress and comes complete with a variety of antiques, including five former passenger cars from the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railroads (and technically VIA, but they&#8217;re ex-CN/CP). Included is the Eatonia, Sir William Eaton&#8217;s private railway car. Most are in poor condition, not being maintained at all and restoration seems not to be a consideration. They do make for interesting photography, though.<br />
I found the group in the main garden wandering about. We gathered, piled into Jean&#8217;s car, and drove out to Revelstoke for dinner. Our first stop sounded good on paper. But the rather angry dog and very unassuming appearance of the restaurant suggested we go elsewhere. This led us up a long windy road to the Glacier Lodge, about a stone&#8217;s throw from the Revelstoke Dam on the west side. A massive log hotel built in 1999, and apparently a great place for dinner.<br />
It was an outstanding dinner. Miso-marinated salmon encrusted with sesame and ginger. It was a powerful but tasty meal. Alex had a lamb shank done Moroccan-style, but became more intrigued with the joint she found in the meat than actually eating it. This tortured poor Boulder, one of the wilderness guide&#8217;s two dogs. He wasn&#8217;t allowed on the patio, but the proudly displayed bone was too much for him to handle. When the waitress scolded Boulder, I suggested that she scold my wife instead for being a tease.<br />
Night photography was marginally successful. The biggest success was capturing an east-bound sulphur train, the lights creating glowing lines across the frame and glinting across the water.<br />
I was woken with a &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221;. The goal was to try and chase 2816 from Palliser to Calgary. Alex would be on her first train chase. But first, we had to have breakfast. We met up with Allen and Jean &#8230; and a few presents.<br />
Sometime in the next while, the group of us will go to Washington and ride the dinner train. That was my present from Allen and Jean. Very nice of them. Alex surprised me with a painting of the York Railway station, circa 1930s/1940s. The kicker is that I sort of knew that she&#8217;d bought <em>something</em> when we were there, but had been told I couldn&#8217;t look at it. Never even thought about it after we got back from England and had since forgotten about it. It was a very welcome surprise.<br />
The Empress had left Revelstoke heading east around 8:00. We passed her arriving at the MacDonald tunnel entrance heading into Roger&#8217;s Pass. In theory, we could have started the chase there. But I wanted to get to Palliser before her to set up, and I knew that the construction traffic would slow us down a bit.<br />
We stopped at Tim Horton&#8217;s for a light snack and teas. As expected, the construction did in fact slow us down. I kept a weather ear out for the train, trying to make sure it wouldn&#8217;t get past us. We arrived at Palliser and took up a position and waited. And waited. And waited.<br />
2816 was supposed to leave Golden at 13:00. At first, I believed that she was just behind schedule. Freight trains get priority in most cases, so it was concievable that a delay would put her off. But 90 minutes somehow didn&#8217;t seem right. Before long, I came to believe that, somehow, she&#8217;d gotten in front of us. Perhaps in Golden, when we were at the Tim&#8217;s. Heartbroken at having to give up on what should have been a great chase, we headed east without train pictures in hand.<br />
As it turned out, we were ahead of 2816. The delay was long, and had we stayed for another 10 minutes, we&#8217;d have gotten the picture. My friend Graham was there not long after we&#8217;d left. I missed a train. Me. The Trainstalker. I feel so ashamed. It put a bit of a downer on my birthday. It seems really trivial, I know, but I just hate missing trains! It was my own fault, though, a lack of patience and too much indecision did me in. Otherwise, it was a good 34th birthday.<br />
Another year older. Hopefully a bit wiser. And perhaps a lot richer. Last year, I wasn&#8217;t married. Next year &#8230; who knows?<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Surprise weekends are a good thing. Especially if you have a good place to go.<br />
We have no standing rule that says we have to go anywhere, though. Although the &#8220;rules&#8221; (such as they are) suggest that staying at home is an option, we have yet to actually do that. This weekend was no different.<br />
<span id="more-440"></span>This weekend was grossly delayed, though. This year has been quite busy with a multitude of things to do and see. As such, we&#8217;re several months behind schedule on surprises. To make sure I don&#8217;t follow too far behind, I felt something particularly nice was important. That&#8217;s how we came to Bow Lake in Banff National Park and Simpson&#8217;s Num-Ti-Jah Lodge.<br />
We went up on Saturday, the first weekend of the Calgary Stampede. In fact, because it&#8217;s Stampede time again, it gave us the opportunity to have a hearty Stampede breakfast in our neighbourhood. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s a homeowner&#8217;s group specifically, but someone definitely has their act together. We came across the same breakfast a year or two ago (admittedly I can&#8217;t remember which) and thought that it would be neat to attend. Little did we know that we&#8217;d be living there. The group puts on a mean breakfast.<br />
We then started the long drive out to Bow Lake. Only I knew where we were going, so it did raise the constant question: &#8220;Where are we going?&#8221; That was usually tied with: &#8220;When will we get there?&#8221; The gaps in between were punctuated with &#8220;How far are we going?&#8221;, &#8220;Are we going to [insert place name here]?&#8221;, and &#8220;Would Asia like going to [insert place name here]?&#8221; (That last one is a nod to a previous spoiled Surprise Weekend where I was caught off-guard with the [[Surprise weekend in Edmonton|mention of my oft-misbehaved cat]].)<br />
Thankfully, I&#8217;m very good at not answering questions like this. In order, the answers might sound like this: &#8220;Somewhere&#8221;, &#8220;Before we go to bed&#8221;, &#8220;As far as we need to&#8221;, &#8220;We might be going there&#8221;, and &#8220;Possibly, but I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d enjoy being caged in the car for more than five minutes&#8221;. (Asia hates going to the vet, which only takes 10 minutes.)<br />
Our first stop was Banff. Not for any real reason other than we had to eat lunch. Our favourite place, the Old Spaghetti Factory, has finally lost its charm. A couple of years ago, they changed their recipe for the bread. It&#8217;s not bread anymore, it&#8217;s some conglomeration of bread-like powder. And the Italian salad dressing is &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how to describe it, but it ain&#8217;t the same. The quality has slumped overall, which is probably to recoup some of the costs on their otherwise reasonably-priced meals. It will likely be the last time I eat there. Considering we&#8217;ve already written off Starbucks, who knows how many more places will end up on the banned list&#8230;<br />
We did a little shopping (I can&#8217;t say for what, though) and I searched for sandals. As of yet, I&#8217;ve found nothing. But then I&#8217;m a picky sandal person, so it&#8217;ll probably take a while. Hopefully not too long, though &#8212; I need a second pair, and soon.<br />
Returning to the car, we headed back to the Trans Canada and continued west. This brought a return of questions regarding our destination, and a wad of non-commital responses. About 40 minutes later, we turned up Highway 93 (the Icefields Parkway part of it, of course). This brought about a specific direction of questions. It&#8217;s about three hours to Jasper, and there isn&#8217;t much in between. Alex wasn&#8217;t too keen on being in the car that long. While not giving away anything truly important, I swore that we wouldn&#8217;t be long until we got there. Well, except for one thing:<br />
I&#8217;d totally forgotten the name of the place we were going.<br />
Thankfully, when the sign came into view, it wasn&#8217;t too hard to realize that we&#8217;d arrived. The cat, as it were, was finally out of the bag.<br />
Room 24 overlooks Bow Lake, facing roughly south. The view is spectacular. They key is big and old, tied to a horseshoe so you don&#8217;t lose it. No fancy electronics here. When we entered the room, we had our Romantic Package waiting for us. In all honesty, I&#8217;d totally forgotten about it. A bottle of champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries all served on a flat rock. Decadent, most certainly.<br />
Being late in the afternoon, we wandered around looking at the natural splendour of the area before going to dinner. One downside were all the bugs. Not mosquitoes, but flies of somekind. Mildly annoying. That and the American tourists who wanted to know about Calgary, yet seemed to &#8220;know&#8221; all the answers. Can&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn &#8217;em&#8230;<br />
Num-Ti-Jah is known for an amazing kitchen. The reputation is well-deserved. The food there is outstanding, if a tad over-priced. (I will freely admit that the Lodge as a whole is expensive. This is not your average stay at a Holiday Inn &#8212; this is on the order of a Fairmont, but at a log-cabin appearance. In all honesty, it&#8217;s worth it. Especially if you&#8217;re there for the nature. If you just want a room, you can go many places that are a lot cheaper. But if you want to hit the trails right after an excellent sleep and a killer breakfast, there isn&#8217;t much better.<br />
Which is pretty much what we did the following morning. Following breakfast, we checked out and packed the car. Tying my car keys to a loop in my pants, we headed off on the 4.5 km trail to Bow Glacier Falls. (As a point of note, bear bells or jingling keys do very little. Bears apparently have no better sense of hearing than humans. So if you think you can hear a bear bell past a couple of hundred metres on a flat plain &#8212; let alone in the forest &#8212; you can imagine how easily you&#8217;d run into a bear. The recommendation is to make a lot of noise. Apparently, that&#8217;s what helps most.<br />
The hike took us about an hour, depositing us at a glacial valley. It&#8217;s bleak, cold, wet, and utterly gorgeous. There&#8217;s just something inspiring about the sheer rawness of an area that has barely any vegetation, where snow probably fills the area metres deep during the winter. Where few humans tread (indeed, we saw only two couples in the area) there is much to be seen.<br />
Returning to the car, we found that a storm was brewing at the south end of the Bow Valley. It seemed that there was a massive storm going over the mountains, probably heading right for Calgary. Indeed, a fair amount of rain and golf ball-sized hail wreaked havoc in the north of Calgary (the south seemed to be spared) later that day.<br />
We ate a bag lunch (courtesy of Num-Ti-Jah) before taking a leisurely drive back to Calgary, managing to avoid getting the Mini hailed on a second time.<br />
