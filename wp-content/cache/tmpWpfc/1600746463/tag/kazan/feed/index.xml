										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, a HUGE thumbs up to Kazan. Wow. Such an amazing little city. I&#8217;m sure Kazan itself is quite large, but the &#8220;main&#8221; area is surprisingly compact yet still very revealing. It is simply too bad that we were only there for the day &#8212; two days should be the required minimum for a stay there.<br />
<span id="more-533"></span>After my stupidly short posting, Amy and I went to hang out in a park for a while, just to watch the city from a distance. Then it was down to the Central Market. The intention had been to buy food for the trip to Ekaterinburg. However, Amy found a stall selling (what she believes is) wool yarn. And lots of it. Cheap.<br />
I really wish I&#8217;d captured her exchange on film. She had to find a way to explain the concept of two-ply yarn to the vendor. Eventually, they figured it out and Amy walked away with 10 balls of the stuff. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have to carry that, but she&#8217;s going to need to ship something home before too long&#8230;<br />
The trip to Ekaterinburg was hot. We were in a room with two quiet guys who didn&#8217;t particularly thrill either Amy or myself. Thankfully, not drunkards, though. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been fearing running into. I&#8217;ve been practising saying &#8220;I&#8217;m an alcoholic&#8221; because it&#8217;s apparently the only way to avoid being nagged into doing vodka shots.<br />
Now to explore Ekaterinburg!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We arrived in Kazan early this morning. I awoke with the sunrise, watching it through the train&#8217;s window. It&#8217;s already 20+ degrees here, which is great for sightseeing. Although unlike Amy, I do find it quite hot.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We arrived in Kazan early this morning. I awoke with the sunrise, watching it through the train&#8217;s window. It&#8217;s already 20+ degrees here, which is great for sightseeing. Although unlike Amy, I do find it quite hot.<br />
Kazan&#8217;s the capital of Tatarstan (home of Tartar sauce?), a not-quite-yet breakaway republic of Russia. It&#8217;s about the same size as Calgary, but sits on the banks of a much larger river &#8212; the Volga. It&#8217;s both a very old city (over 1,000 years!) but also new &#8212; they&#8217;re building/rebuilding quite a lot here.<br />
This is truly a wonderful city. It&#8217;s warm, comfortable, and people are far too nice here. Despite not knowing any Russian, we&#8217;ve had next to no trouble at all getting help from everyone around us. A person not knowing the language at all would do well here.<br />
Time&#8217;s running out for me on this post, though &#8212; internet is hard to find here today. More from Ekaterinburg!<br />
(Next time, I get to post before Amy&#8230;)</p>
