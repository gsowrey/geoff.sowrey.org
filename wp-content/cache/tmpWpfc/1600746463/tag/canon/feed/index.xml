										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I went off to Japan to visit my friend Chris. I took along my (at the time) fancy digital camera: a Canon Pro 90 IS. Fancy in that it was big mega-pixels (for the time) and had an image stabiliser built-in (that&#8217;s what the &#8220;IS&#8221; stands for). Like I do now, I used it to document the heck out of my trip.<br />
One thing Canon had on its prosumer cameras at the time that they took out of the DSLR line was the panorama assist mode (I don&#8217;t think it exists in any of their models now &#8212; does it?). A handy feature, it let you create panoramic views by being able to line up your previous shot. Then you used some included software, and BOOM!, you had a panorama.<br />
Or that&#8217;s how it was supposed to work.<br />
<span id="more-1031"></span>It wasn&#8217;t perfect. And if you didn&#8217;t follow good practises, you ended up with somewhat sketchy pictures. Back then, I was still fairly new at all this, and my skills with the lens were sorely lacking. For example, I tried to use the fancy mode to do panoramas in both Akihabara and Shibuya in Japan:<br />

Canon Photostitch &#8212; the software included with my camera &#8212; did a reasonable job on well-aligned photos, but was not able to correct even slight mis-alignments. And if you don&#8217;t travel with a tripod &#8212; which I didn&#8217;t at the time &#8212; you were asking for trouble. Or really weird results.<br />
In truth, I was very upset when I got these pictures. I really wanted the panoramas. I spent hours trying to correct it. But the problem is mathematical, not image. I needed a better tool.<br />
Enter my old friend, Photoshop. (Is there anything Photoshop can&#8217;t do?) The Automate &gt; Photomerge feature is so handy, it&#8217;s almost frightening. Suck in a few pictures, and Photoshop goes to work on them. What do I end up with?<br />
Pictures that are light-years better. (End photos were slightly tweaked through Lightroom.)<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s weird. I&#8217;m not sure what it is. When I was in Panama a few weeks ago, I was out happily snapping pictures when, for reasons I simply don&#8217;t understand, the auto-focus stopped working.<br />
My first thought was condensation. My camera had been inside an air-conditioned room for a day or so, and Panama is warm and humid. Bad combination for cameras, I tell you. I figured enough time to warm up and allow the condensation to leave should be enough.<br />
It&#8217;s been a few weeks. The auto-focus still doesn&#8217;t work. The camera still seems to take decent pictures (manual focus is still available), but I&#8217;ve come to rely on the auto-focus to make sure my pictures are tack sharp.<br />
I&#8217;ve checked the AF regions. I&#8217;ve reset all the settings. I&#8217;ve cleaned the pins and lens contacts (it happens with both my lenses). I&#8217;ve cleaned the mirror, too.<br />
Anyone know what might be wrong? I&#8217;m outta ideas, and sending my camera to the shop to fix here in Costa Rica raises a number of language-based issues.</p>
