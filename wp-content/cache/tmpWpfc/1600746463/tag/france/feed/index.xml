										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The flight left Charles du Gaulle at 11:30. That meant, of course, that I had to be there in sufficient time to check in, get through security, find the flight, and so forth.<br />
Thankfully, I&#8217;d gone through the trouble last night of finding the RER station at Chatelet-les-Halles. As is turns out, it&#8217;s a weird sort of situation. Chatelet is the Metro station. Les Halles is an ex-market area. Chatelet-les-Halles is a station almost mid-way, pretty much right under my hotel, actually. So there was a fair bit of walking to get there and back. Which was fine, no biggie. It was still cheaper than taking a cab.<br />
Albeit a lot more packed. While my trip in on Monday was blissfully free of people, the train was nearly full leaving Chatelet-les-Halles. When we left Gare du Nord, it was standing room in some places. The only stop after that was the airport. It&#8217;s effective public transportation, I&#8217;ll give you that! (Canadian airports and cities, please take note!)<br />
No elevators this time to slow me down. Just a really long lineup for Lufthansa. It took nearly 45 minutes to weave my way down to a clerk. I had a bit of a terrific thought as I waited. Technically, my flight is Air Canada. What if I had to go to the Air Canada counter? They&#8217;re not even in the same terminal. My only consolation was when I&#8217;d verified my flight this morning, the Lufthansa website told me my seat assignment. I could only hope that it also covered my Air Canada seat from Frankfurt to Calgary.<br />
Fears bubbled away as the rather cheery clerk (given the insane volume of people) jokingly suggested that my flight was cancelled and that I had to stay in Paris indefinitely. Admittedly, I was briefly tempted to believe him. But the rest of me quickly kicked in &#8212; I wanted to go home. I spent about 1/10th the time at the counter as the previous couple. Bag checked, boarding passes for both flights in-hand, I headed for Satellite 6.<br />
That&#8217;s the way Terminal 1 is broken up: a central hub with seven satellite areas for boarding planes. And sadly, that&#8217;s about literally all there is at Terminal 1. It&#8217;s devoid of almost everything else. It&#8217;s probably the dullest terminal I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of waiting around in for an hour and a half. (I prefer to wait in airport terminals, rather than rushing. Too many variables that could lead to a missed flight.)<br />
I had planned my Euro spending carefully, having only barely enough to pay for a muffin at a small cafe in the waiting lounge. That was fine with me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t want to go home with extra change. Still, I would have liked a ham and cheese baguette.<br />
Like the train out, the flight out was also full. Although I had an exit row, I was seated next to a woman who clearly did not fit in her chair (or really give her late-teenage son any credit for anything). I think this is partly what led to a rearrangement of seats. She was moved to the front of the plane, and the couple across the aisle were bumped a row up. The staff didn&#8217;t say why, but since I was allowed to remain and thinner people were placed in the now-vacant aisle seats next to me, I can only assume it was to ensure that the exit aisles could be cleared quickly.<br />
I passed out from exhaustion moments after the plane left the ground. I awoke only when the attendant happened to rather loudly plunk ice in a plastic cup. I was thankful for this &#8212; I got my cheese sandwich on dense German bread and a Coke. That would keep me going until I got my meal on the trans-atlantic flight.<br />
Virtually retracing my steps through Frankfurt to find my next flight (including the 700 metre-long tunnel), I rushed along just in case there was a lot of people at security. Given how heavy the airport traffic was, I didn&#8217;t want to risk holding things up. As it stands, I didn&#8217;t have to pass through security this time &#8212; just passport control. While not the speediest passing through, I was asked no questions. Stamp, done.<br />
Just past passport control was my gate, so I suddenly found myself with almost an hour to kill. Boarding would start soon, but my seat row meant I would be among the last called. Not a big deal, and far more comfortable as I wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to a jet engine the entire flight.<br />
My rowmate (I love the outside row &#8212; only two seats) was an oil driller from Oman, travelling back to his home around Great Slave Lake or something to visit family. He&#8217;d been flying already for about 20 hours. I couldn&#8217;t believe that level of stamina. I think I&#8217;d lose it after that long, personally. (I want to go to Australia someday, but the flight worries me a little.) He started chatting with me almost barely five minutes after sitting down. So much for a quiet flight.<br />
Actually, that&#8217;s not fair. He was an interesting person, having seen a great deal more than I have. And made me feel pretty damned petty about my mere 35 degree woes. Where he worked, it was 55 Celsius, not counting the blowing sand. He slept most of the flight, too, likely due to exhaustion.<br />
The flight was mostly uneventful. Some bouncing around (though we had a nasty approach to Calgary due to strong winds), the movies were there and the food was decent. I plugged away at getting these blog entries caught up. And I slept, even if just a little. While I hadn&#8217;t been flying for 20 hours before this one, I was still wiped.<br />
My bag was #155 coming off the carousel at the airport. Typical. Pass through customs, and waited to be picked up. Surprisingly not tired, I fully expect to pass out tonight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Free day. I had some variety of grandiose plans for today. I was going to see so much of Paris that I&#8217;d be actually tired of it.<br />
That had been the plan. What I hadn&#8217;t planned on was how tired I was going to feel when I woke up.<br />
<span id="more-448"></span>That was 9:00. Ninety minutes after I&#8217;d hoped to get up. I was already well behind schedule. I skipped the shower, dressed, grabbed my camera and French-English pocket dictionary (just in case) and ran out the door. I went down a very narrow street a block away from Rue du Rivoli until I got to Rue du l&#8217;Amiral de Coligny. I headed down that road directly to the Louvre, my first stop of the morning. (My first stop was supposed to be Notre Dame, but I figured it would wait until the next time I was in Paris.)<br />
I was supposed to zip in, see the <em>Mona Lisa</em> and a couple of other works, then run off to the Musee d&#8217;Orsay. As it stood, I went in through the Pyramid (and the metal detectors and x-ray machines &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking into an airport) and stepped into the lobby where I would make my purchase and devour the great works of art. I instead chose to go through the massive underground mall that exists, heading west, and emerging at the edge of the Tuilleries. The Louvre would wait for another time.<br />
The Musee d&#8217;Orsay almost got the same treatment. But it had two things going for it. First, it used to be a train station, and you know me and trains. Second, it had a lot of Rodin, and I had spent a fair amount of time writing manuals for a tool called Rodin. The thought of seeing <em>The Thinker</em> was too overwhelming to miss it.<br />
As it turns out, I&#8217;m a bit of twit. <em>The Thinker</em> is at the Rodin Museum, not the Musee d&#8217;Orsay. It wasn&#8217;t a wasted effort though, as I still enjoyed wandering around the gallery. Admittedly, I cut it short due more to exhaustion than anything else.<br />
Back on the road, I headed west (ish), I passed by the Palais Bourbon, which is part of the National Assembly. I didn&#8217;t realize this until later, but it explains all the Gendarmes in the area. My goal was the Hotel les Invalides, a hospital initiated by the Sun King to help all the soldiers who&#8217;d give up limbs (or their vision) in the course of fighting for France. I wanted to see the Short Dead Dude &#8212; Napoleon. The building is gorgeous, the grounds are beautiful, and the entire area oozes with history.<br />
And yet I passed it by. I opted to only go through the building, not really see anything, and continue on my merry little way.<br />
Eiffel Tower. Snap. Walk under. Snap snap. Walk across the Seine and over to get a view the other way. Snap.<br />
Don&#8217;t ask me why I was hurrying. I think part of it was that I hadn&#8217;t the energy to do anything more. I was exhausted. And I was also flirting with doing too much on my own. I hadn&#8217;t really wanted to go to Paris without Alex. But you do what you have to for your client. (I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Ooooh, that&#8217;s so rough, having to travel to Paris. It&#8217;s hard to believe, but business travel ain&#8217;t all fun and games. And it&#8217;s taken me a couple of years to understand that.) So a part of me was driving me to see cursory glances, and not dive deep for now.<br />
I went into the Trocadero Metro station. This would be my first real experience with the Paris Metropolitan system. Le Metro is a handy way to get around, and stations are everywhere. Except at the Eiffel Tower. I have no idea why, since you&#8217;d think that would be a handy way to get tourists from Point A to Point B.<br />
I was going to head to Montmartre to see the Sacre Coeur Basilica. But time was becoming an issue. It was after 13:00, and I still had souvenirs to buy for those back home. Didier had recommended stores for me to review, so off I went in search of les bijoux. My first stop was Avenue de Champs Elysee. Due to a misjudgement, it was a couple of stops away from the stores. But it did give me a chance to have something to eat. It was after 13:30 by this point, and I hadn&#8217;t eaten at all since the night before. Great thing about Paris &#8212; a stall selling ham and gruyere baguettes are never far away.<br />
The Champs Elysee is noted for basically one thing: Shopping. There are a couple of movie theatres, the Disco Queen (a primarily gay club), a rather large HSBC, and a couple of car dealerships, which came as a bit of a surprise. The &#8220;south&#8221; side isn&#8217;t as interesting as the north side, which contains stores like Zara and Cartier. Considering my quarry was of the shiny, sparkly variety, that was where I was headed.<br />
Or at least attempted. Nicely-clothed &#8220;guards&#8221; at Cartier turned me away. (Jerks.) Another store turned away the penniless merely through a withering look from a store clerk. (They must go to school for that.) Other stores just had this air of &#8220;you can&#8217;t afford anything in here, so don&#8217;t even think about it&#8221;.<br />
The other problem I ran into was the requirements I&#8217;d been handed. Certain colours, sizes and shapes. There couldn&#8217;t be any claws. No yellow gold. (Silver was acceptable, of course. It&#8217;s just the colour.) Most of what I could find was bulky, gaudy, yellow, huge, or claw-set. It wasn&#8217;t for a lack of trying, either. Every arcade searched, every store that I could get into was carefully scrutinized. I spent 20 minutes on the south side, and nearly an hour on the north. All to no avail.<br />
Although I was also supposed to check out Place Vendome, I thought I&#8217;d go check out Montmartre first. So back into the Metro. A couple of line changes later, I wearily (and very thirstily) emerged just south of Sacre Coeur. A short walk up an alley and I was looking up the hill towards the landmark church.<br />
It felt kind of neat to be there. One of the scenes in <em>Amelie </em>had been filmed at that location. I had always thought that the carousel had been put there only for the movie. Turns out it&#8217;s there all the time. I raced up the zig-zag sides to the top, following the route Nino had to find his lost book of photographs. At the top, I looked down as Nino had to see Amelie return his book to his motorbike. I&#8217;d almost expected to see Audrey Tautou at the bottom.<br />
I bought a drink from a vending machine when I got back to the Metro. My throat felt like dust, and I couldn&#8217;t justify nearly $3.50 for a small bottle of Coke. (Turns out that it&#8217;s the going rate around Paris. The tourist-infested areas, anyway.) I partially retraced my steps to find myself at the Opera stop.<br />
I&#8217;d seen a cutaway model of the Paris Opera House in the Musee d&#8217;Orsay, near a 1/10th scale model of the Opera neighbourhood area that had been overrun with life-size animals. It was a bit of an odd piece of art, and I&#8217;m sure somewhere that it makes sense to someone. The cutaway had led me to the real thing. That, and a memory of a scene in <em>The Fifth Element</em> that takes place in a recreation of the Paris Opera House. I zipped in for a quick peek of the ornate lobby.<br />
Again the need to get souvenirs took over all sense and I headed back outside and over to Place Vendome, very near to the Opera House. This was when I realized that I&#8217;m not really set up for the Paris elite. When you pass by a store that showcases a 70,000 euro watch as if it were little more than a mere bauble, you know that you&#8217;re way out of your league. I was feeling quite dejected at this point. I wasn&#8217;t finding what I had hoped to find.<br />
I returned to the Opera House to console myself with some inspirational architecture. And it is inspirational. Although the actual theatre area is almost ludicrously tiny, it is gorgeous. (And the opera house in &#8220;<em>The Fifth Element</em>&#8221; was in Covent Garden, London, England.) The reception area is unbelieveable. I can only imagine the glitterati who have haunted the halls since the building was completed.<br />
I found a small souvenir store as I trudged towards the Louvre. A t-shirt, chocolates, and a small scale model of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The rest came from the mall under the Louvre. Essenses from the former French colonies, a bottle of cedar perfume (for spraying on furniture or in rooms to freshen the air &#8212; not for people), and a very unique looking Swatch. Not the shiny bijoux that I had hoped for, but hopefully they&#8217;ll be well-accepted.<br />
I watched most of &#8220;<em>Alien vs. Predator</em>&#8220;, dubbed in French, and relieved my feet of the strain of supporting my bulk. I rested for a while until around 19:00, when I ventured back out again.<br />
I did my first bit of wandering around the area around the hotel on my own. It&#8217;s a nice, albeit loud area. I settled for dinner at Cafe Rive Droit: a beer and a crepe. I tried to practice my French as much as possible, but I really screwed up a couple of times. Most notably when I asked for the bill. Instead of asking for &#8220;l&#8217;addition&#8221;, I apparently asked for intestinal surgery. The waiter had quite a chuckle at my mistake.<br />
Grabbing my camera and tripod from the hotel, I headed to Les Halles to catch a Metro to Trocadero. (Turns out I should have gone to Chatelet &#8212; while you can go in at Les Halles, you walk a long way underground to the Chatelet station.) It wasn&#8217;t a wasted trip, as I at least have an idea of where I&#8217;m going tomorrow morning.<br />
I managed to get a prime location overlooking the pools looking towards the Eiffel Tower. The sun had set, and we were now waiting for the sky to turn dark and the lights to show through. That, and wait for the hourly sparkle show. Despite lots of people coming and going, I managed to hold my ground, keeping my place to take pictures. I avoided putting up my tripod until the last minute, just in case the stories of Gendarmes looking for permits from people with tripods were true. (Tripods, at least in Paris, make you a professional photographer, and subject to permits.) I snapped no less than 30 pictures without a single problem.<br />
Except for a bit of shmutz on my lens, that is.<br />
As I ended my time looking at the Tower, I was joined by two students from Brazil who had just completed their engineering degrees. We chatted about cameras and what would potentially make my pictures better than theirs. I complemented them on their fine English, to which they claimed it was horrible. I merely replied that they spoke three languages, whereas I have trouble with just one.<br />
With that, I headed to a nearby vendor for an ice cream cone, looked at the Tower one last time, and headed back to the Metro to return to my bed and pass out from sheer exhaustion.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ate at the hotel this morning. Not a bad little place, really. And it meant I could sleep in a wee bit. Four hours of sleep just isn&#8217;t enough. But I brought that on myself.<br />
I was a bit late arriving at Eurosites &#8212; about five minutes. This was not due to the aforementioned lack of sleep, though. This was due to the previously mentioned crappy wireless internet connection. I was determined to send out some emails before I left for training, and the connection just wasn&#8217;t offering up what I needed. When I finally got it working, I almost ran out the door to get to training on time. Kayo, Loic, and Adam were already there.<br />
<span id="more-447"></span>I wasn&#8217;t the only one to show up late. Although we&#8217;d planned to start at 9:30, the last stragglers didn&#8217;t show up until after 10:00. Training went relatively easily, and we got into doing examples. I spent the time mostly handling some issues through email.<br />
Lunch was at Chien Qui Fumer again. French onion soup and steak. Smoking. Almost all of us drinking Coke and/or coffee. It was warm. I was thankful to finally leave and go back to training.<br />
We wrapped up by about 15:30, with some meetings going on a bit longer. I help Erica work through finding a router for the Paris office. They have a single network connection, and three people. Hence the need for a router. We went through specs and finally figured out what they need. Hopefully Erica can find one tomorrow without too much difficulty.<br />
When Jaime finally got out of her meeting, we all had another meeting to attend &#8212; a design review. With the Calgary office. Jaime, Erica, Mark, and myself all crammed into my tiny hotel room, using Jaime&#8217;s cell phone (which had a speaker) for the conference, and my laptop for the presentation. We were so drained from the day (and the week) that we were giddy. If Joanne hadn&#8217;t (wisely) retreated to her room, I can only imagine how much concentration we&#8217;d have been able to devote.<br />
Meeting over, the five of us headed for a nearby Moroccan restaurant. Exhausted, we had trouble eating. (And it was a lot of food.) It wasn&#8217;t long before we all headed back to our respective places of rest. I won&#8217;t see Mark or Erica again until the Summer Event in a few weeks. I might see Joanne tomorrow, but there are no plans. Jaime will be back in Calgary on Monday. Thankfully, today is the last business day of the week. I had dreaded additional meetings tomorrow, but it looks like none will occur.<br />
After resting a while, I went back out to take some night pictures of Paris. But my heart was barely in it. I&#8217;m tired. I&#8217;m so glad this week is over.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s official, I am a shmuck. I&#8217;m a unilingual moron.<br />
But more on that later&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-446"></span>I&#8217;ve been getting up at 7:30 to account for the lateness we&#8217;ve been having, but also to ensure I&#8217;ve got enough rest to not tire during the day. Almost immediately, I flipped on BBC World News (one of only two English channels on the TV, in addition to CNN International). I honestly forget how much I love the BBC until I don&#8217;t watch it for a while, then see it again. I fell in love with it last year when I did that little sojourn &#8217;round the planet, and watch it whenever I can. Despite being British, the BBC covers world news, touching only periodically on events &#8220;back home&#8221;.<br />
Lately, the big news has been Israel&#8217;s attack-cum-invasion of Lebanon. In typical BBC form, they cover the situation without fanfare and without a great deal of bias. Whereas CNN seems to place Israel as more of the hero, the BBC largely vilifies the asault as unwarranted in terms of the civilian casualties. They place Israel as the aggressor, and the US is supporting Israel to the detriment of others. This is most notable in the US&#8217; blocking of UN Security Council actions against Israel.<br />
The BBC also shed some light on something I&#8217;ve never truly understood &#8212; why the US is always the first country to stand up for Israel. According to the news report (so take that for what it&#8217;s worth), it&#8217;s a religious reason. People are interpreting parts of the Bible (which parts of which version, I&#8217;m not entirely sure &#8212; I forgot the quoted scripture chapters) that say a good Christian should be giving their worldly wealth to Zion to prepare for the second coming of Christ. And everyone wonders why there is so much strife in the world&#8230;<br />
The client team flew in from Geneva, so we didn&#8217;t start training until 10:30. Overall today went quite well, covering the major introductory topics before Jaime, Didier, and the client lead went off for a meeting in the afternoon. I hope that by the end of tomorrow, we can all walk away with a solid understanding of how this will all work. (Well, <em>I</em> have a solid idea, but I&#8217;ve already been through a week and a half of training.)<br />
Lunch was off-site, at a restaurant called &#8220;Au Chien qui Fumer&#8221; &#8212; the Dog That Smokes. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but Paris seems to have a mild obsession with smoking. In fact, beyond Jaime, Adam, Loic, and myself, I think everyone smokes. It&#8217;s more than just a little uncomfortable at times. But these are the sacrifices that I have to make, I guess. Lunch was quite long, featuring a wonderful chicken fricassee and a tasty, albeit odd creme brulee (unlike the ones I&#8217;m familiar with, a small dish, this was wide but shallow).<br />
I was dying in the heat, my undershirt soaking up the litres of sweat I seemed to be pouring out. I&#8217;m Canadian, and built for winters. I never liked summers. They were always too hot when I was growing up. Paris is warmer (right now, anyway) than it had been back in Oakville all those years. And I can&#8217;t wear shorts &#8212; I need to be adequately dressed, and even though I left my jacket back at Eurosites I was still boiling in my own clothes. The goal was to try not complain about it (which I know I&#8217;m prone to) and put on the best face I could. I hope it came across that way.<br />
But I think the heat got to me anyway &#8212; I nearly passed out in the afternoon session. At first I thought it was just lunch&#8217;s carbohydrates taking their toll on me, but when a wave of near-nausea wafted through my head, I knew there was something else up. I had to excuse myself twice &#8212; the second time for a while to sit in the lounge, drinking a Coke to try and stimulate whatever it was to get out of my noggin. It seemed to help, anyway.<br />
With the Calgary day starting by 16:00 Paris time, the Critical Mass folks had to get down to the business of &#8230; business. No rest for the wicked, as it were. Jaime called up to my room around 19:15 so we could have a discussion over the meeting she&#8217;d had with the client for most of the afternoon. We went over the fundamentals of schedule, technical implementation, and adaptions on delivery. Every day I amaze myself more and more that I can actually speak to these sorts of things, and apparently speak to them well. A part of me always wonders if I really have the slightest idea what I&#8217;m actually doing. I&#8217;m sure I do, but self-doubt always keeps me guessing. I consider that a good thing, though &#8212; I&#8217;d rather always second guess than blindly go forward without a clue.<br />
The other major point was that dinner plans had changed. Originally, we were to go to Georges, a restaurant on the top of the Centre Pompiadieu not far from the hotel. Weather being what it is, Didier opted a move to one of his favourite restaurants, 6 New York, one of the more chic Parisian restaurants.<br />
Adam, Joanne, and I crammed into a cab and flew across the north side of the Seine in mere minutes. A subway ride could have taken four times as long, and we didn&#8217;t have long until we were to meet. There were 14 of us crammed around the table, most of us attempted to space around so it was a mix of Critical Mass, Datasia, and client. Clumping, however, was inevitable.<br />
Now we get back to me being a shmuck. Except for Adam (and possibly Joanne, but admittedly I don&#8217;t know for sure), everyone else at the table could speak French, even if serviceably. I can understand a lot of French (and certain so far this week, I&#8217;ve had my high school French class memories flooding back relentlessly) and I can read French. But I cannot speak it. I can&#8217;t think fast enough on conjugations, correct nouns and verbs, and I never really did get the whole past/future tense thing figured out. Never mind the colloquialisms or slang. I had to continually revert to English, joking only that my favourite French words were &#8220;<a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/appellation-d-origine-contr-l-e">appellation contrÃ´lée</a>&#8220;.<br />
Didier knows the chef. It&#8217;s within clear view of the Eiffel Tower. It has French-Asian fusion cuisine. It&#8217;s &#8230; unlike anything I&#8217;d ever had before. The opener was something I can&#8217;t even describe, other than exceptionally tasty. The appetizer of spring rolls were totally new to me. The main course was a selection of beef unequalled by any steak house in Calgary. And the dessert &#8230; it&#8217;s risqué, but I&#8217;ll just say that the chef somehow figured out how to distill sex. As I exclaimed in my horror, realizing that the dinner was almost over, food is going to taste like sawdust in comparison when I get home!<br />
Following our near-religious experience at dinner, Elena, Loic, and Stan headed home. Adam went back to the hotel to get some work done. The rest of us piled into cabs (Mark and I in Didier&#8217;s car) and headed to a club a block away from Avenue du Champs Elysee. It was the quietest club I&#8217;d ever been in &#8212; I could actually hear myself think! I didn&#8217;t stay long though, as I also had some work to do. Unable to catch a cab, I walked the 45 minutes back to the hotel.<br />
Tomorrow is the last day of training. It&#8217;s almost 3:30 in the morning. I hope I get enough sleep so I don&#8217;t fall asleep tomorrow&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No crepes for me this morning. As I&#8217;m beginning to discover, the French don&#8217;t consider crepes a breakfast thing. At least at the shops near the hotel. But hunger knows no bounds and I was forced to hunt out an alternative. The hotel clerk misdirected me to a boulangerie (that wasn&#8217;t there), but I managed to find a small grocery store on the way back to the hotel. A warm baguette and a chunk of a somewhat smelly cheese made for a pretty decent breakfast. The leftovers should cover me for tomorrow as well.<br />
<span id="more-445"></span>At 9:15, Adam and I wandered over to the Eurosites building (at 55 rue du Rivoli) to meet up with Stan. Thankfully, Stan was already there &#8212; the walk took barely four minutes from the hotel door. Stan works at Datasia and has been hugely instrumental in getting the training set up. He organized the training centre, made sure all the hardware was in place, got the manuals printed, and coordinated pretty much everything I couldn&#8217;t. For some reason, I thought he&#8217;d be completely different from how I met him. Much younger, extremely well-spoken, and a snazzy dresser to boot! We talked briefly before I headed back to the hotel, leaving Adam to configure the computers for the training tomorrow.<br />
Eurosites supplies meeting rooms. This is mostly because some companies don&#8217;t have meeting rooms (Critical Mass has well over 20 of them in the Calgary office alone) and many of the hotels are without conference rooms. They also supply computers, projectors, and drinks and snacks to get through those all-days slogs.<br />
Adam needs to install RedDot on all the computers. I had thought installing on one computer and sharing that would be better, but Adam believes it&#8217;s possible. They&#8217;re all Windows XP systems though, and I remember the grief we had trying to install RedDot on our systems. Still, Adam is confident, and I&#8217;ll have to put my faith into his abilities. He&#8217;s said something about using VMware, so maybe that&#8217;ll solve the problem.<br />
I finished a batch of email at the hotel before meeting up with the crew around 11:00 in the lobby. Joanne and Erica arrived yesterday (and it sounds like Joanne&#8217;s flight wasn&#8217;t as much fun as mine); Mark arrived late this afternoon and missed all the fun. Jaime came in and the four of us adjourned to the cafe next door for coffee (and tea, for me) to go over the workflow that Adam and I came up with yesterday. We know it&#8217;s not final, but we&#8217;ve got meetings with Datasia this afternoon, and we need this so it&#8217;s easier to discuss with Datasia.<br />
We had a lunch meeting with Didier at Cafe Marly at 12:45 sharp, so we broke at 12:30 to get there in time. We assumed it was in walking distance. I also wanted to check in on Adam to see how he was doing. Stan, it seemed, as joining us, and told us that it was in the Louvre. Suddenly, I realized that I&#8217;d seen Cafe Marly last night when walking through the Louvre&#8217;s courtyards. I also realized that Jaime, Erica, and Joanne were wandering Rue du Rivoli not having a clue where this place was. It seems that the street numbers don&#8217;t necessarily match up, for whatever reason.<br />
Running into them along the way, the five us hustled over to the Louvre. We passed into through the eastern gate into the Cour Carree. Supposedly, this is one of Stan&#8217;s favourite places in Paris. I can certainly see why. We walked quickly into the Cour Napoleon and walked to the Richelieu Wing where we found Cafe Marly. Loic, one of the translation managers, met us on the steps. I recognized Didier&#8217;s voice before I actually saw him. Much younger than I had thought (he&#8217;s probably younger than me). The Datasia team is really impressing me, and I&#8217;m only just really meeting them.<br />
Cafe Marly is very nice &#8212; a wonderful view over the courtyard and the Louvre Pyramid. And the food is very French &#8230; even if there is the near-ubiquitous hamburger on the menu. Even in the shade, it was still hot. Sweat dripped down my back almost the entire time we were there. (Thankfully, I&#8217;d had the foresight to wear an undershirt.) But despite the heat, it was still an excellent place to be for lunch.<br />
It was our first official meeting with Datasia, and I felt a bit of an idiot. I quickly realized that I was the only one at the table who couldn&#8217;t speak serviceable French. Erica is fluent (or at least awfully darn close to fluent). While Jaime isn&#8217;t fluent yet, she&#8217;s many kilometres ahead of me, and can carry on a conversation.<br />
We returned to Eurosites after lunch for the business end of the meeting. It was our first chance to discuss the translation workflow. I won&#8217;t bore anyone with the details, but there is something to be said for having these meetings face-to-face. You can have conversations over a phone or even over email and IM. But you can&#8217;t see someone&#8217;s reaction to an idea, you can&#8217;t judge someone&#8217;s thoughts if you can&#8217;t see their face. And yes, you could do this over video conferencing, but admittedly there is still a separation. I&#8217;m not saying that all meetings should be face-to-face, but if they&#8217;re important it definitely helps to fly 9.5 hours.<br />
After the meeting, we all returned to the hotel to get some work done. Mark arrived not long afterwards, but we had to wait for him to get to his place in downtown Paris. (The poor guy had flown from Ireland to Calgary, then turned around after a day &#8212; two at most &#8212; to fly all the way back across the Atlantic to Paris.)<br />
We met up with Mark outside of La Fumoir, a cafe across the street from the Louvre. (Didier had recommended it earlier in the day.) Despite the name (&#8220;the smoker&#8221;), it wasn&#8217;t actually that bad inside. One of the things I&#8217;m learning about Paris is that a lot of people smoke. It&#8217;s taking some getting used to. Which is to say I won&#8217;t get used to it. Problems with being a near-militant anti-smoker.<br />
Dinner in Paris is slow. There is no rush or pressure to eat. Dinner is a social activity and something that takes time. Food comes almost when the kitchen feels like serving it. And generally, people don&#8217;t inhale their meals, preferring to draw a simple appetizer out for as long as possible.<br />
While inside, massive thunderstorms rolled over Paris. Flashes from outside periodically brightened the dim interior for a brief moment. The temperature even seemed to drop a little inside the cafe, as the cooler outside air began to mingle. When we finally emerged around 23:30 (which was still early, at least by Parisian schedules), it was much cooler outside and a nice breeze made walking very comfortable. Even if the humidity was several points higher.<br />
I just finished wrestling with the uber-crappy wireless connection at the hotel. While free, which is nice, the wretched thing cuts out constantly. And there are times you can&#8217;t connect. I need to send emails back to Calgary to cover off things that I&#8217;m responsible for. Ain&#8217;t easy when you can&#8217;t get online.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite wating up at 4:30 thinking it was daylight (in reality, only the hotel&#8217;s light outside my window), I slept pretty well. That didn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;d totally licked jet lag &#8212; I ended up needing a nap in the afternoon. Hopefully, though, that was the last of it and I&#8217;ll be able to carry through without difficulty.<br />
I met Adam in the lobby as I tried to resolve why I couldn&#8217;t connect to the internet. There&#8217;s something with the wireless connection here, and I think they turn the connection off at night. I can connect to the router, but not a single thing beyond that. Purely a guess, but it seems safe enough. Adam was down there for the same reason.<br />
<span id="more-444"></span>Deciding that breakfast was in order while waiting for the internet to come back. So off we went in search of something. Thankfully, a little cafe nearby sold ham and cheese crepes, which happen to be one of my favourite things to eat first thing in the morning. Unlike the ones at the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market, these take a while to eat. They&#8217;re quite heavy, and lasted me pretty much to dinner. Which was good, since I had a lot of work to attend to before then.<br />
Dinner was after 19:30. Adam and I found a cafe down by the river, Au Vieux Chatelet. The waiter, extremely helpful and willing to talk in English if needed, was prompt and courteous. (People have complained about French waiters, but I have yet to see it.) Chicken and fries. It seems almost everything comes with fries in this city. But that&#8217;s fine with me &#8212; easy to get and eat. But I know in a day or two I&#8217;m gonna have vegetable withdrawal.<br />
I went for a walk after dinner. I&#8217;m taking advantage of as much time as I can get to see as much as I can of this very intriguing city. I walked a ways down Rue du Rivoli before heading down to the river, towards the Louvre. Once in the courtyard, I found my way to the Pyramid to see what it was all about. Admittedly, it wasn&#8217;t about much. Beautiful, but still a little bit jarring against the renaissance architecture of the Louvre buildings. And for those of you who have seen &#8220;<em>The Da Vinci Code</em>&#8220;, no, there are no Rose Line markers. I checked.<br />
From there I walked to Le Jardin des Tuileries. It was suggested that I spend time in there, but I decided to speed through (it was already getting dark and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see much there), heading towards the Arc du Triomphe. I didn&#8217;t go the whole way, as I was actually aiming for La Tour Eiffel. Because the city is partly in a grid and partly follows the river, it took me a while to get there. It took well over an hour to walk there from the hotel.<br />
But it was worth the walk. I&#8217;ve seen the Tokyo Tower, which is a (slightly larger) copy of the Eiffel Tower. I think I prefer the Eiffel Tower, especially at night. The square directly under the tower was packed full of tourists looking at the tower and standing in lines to get a ride up to the top. I paused only long enough for some photographs before continuing into Parc due Champ de Mara. You&#8217;d think that a park would be mostly devoid of people at almost 23:00. But the French have a decidedly different approach to nightlife, and the park was full of people watching the tower as if it was a drive-in movie.<br />
As I returned to the Seine about 10 minutes later I learned why they were waiting. At 23:00 (presumably every night), the tower lights up with strobe lights for a few minutes. Thousands of them. It looks like people are placed all over the strucure with their cameras, taking flash pictures at night. It&#8217;s quite the sight. I wish I&#8217;d stuck around to see it up-close, rather than several blocks away.<br />
Along the south side of the Seine almost until just past the Pont d&#8217;Orsay, where I crossed on a footbridge and headed over to the Louvre to take a picture of the Pyramid at night. Then it was back to the Seine and another footbridge that looked towards Ile de la Cite. A few long-exposure pictures there, and I was headed back to the hotel. My feet are killing me.<br />
Tomorrow, the official meetings begin, and my tourism of Paris comes to an end (most likely).<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m beginning to understand why people hate business trips. You can&#8217;t pack what you want (you have to pack for meetings with clients) and you don&#8217;t travel necessarily when you want. But at least the locations can be interesting&#8230;<br />
The account I work on now is European. They&#8217;ve got a massive global presence and are very good to work with. They tend not to hesitate on monetary decisions (unlike most clients), perferring to get the image just right (and understandably so). So when they said that I needed to be present when they were trained with the new RedDot Content Management System, I wasn&#8217;t the least bit surprised when they said I had to fly to Paris.<br />
Yes, that Paris. France.<br />
<span id="more-443"></span>Clothes were going to be a bit of a dicey issue. First, Paris is extremely hot right now, thanks to a Europe-wide heat wave. According to the Weather Network forecast, it will be over 37 degrees Celsius on Wednesday (that&#8217;s 100 degrees Fahrenheit for you non-Metric types). And I have to be in a suit. I&#8217;m not looking forward to that. Thankfully Jaime (my account manager) suggested that golf shirts would be suitable as well. Alex was very kind in selecting some for me that should hopefully do the trick.<br />
The trick part of packing for client meetings is the length of the visit. I&#8217;m in Paris almost a week. A couple of days will be mostly on my own (or with the RedDot instructor), so I&#8217;m not too worried about dress on those days. When I&#8217;m with the client, however, that&#8217;s another issue. I need to make sure that I&#8217;m dressed appropriately, and that I&#8217;ve given myself enough variation to adjust to the dress code of the day. I had to haul out a suitcase I haven&#8217;t used in years &#8212; the only one I have for packing suits.<br />
That distraction did cause a few problems. First, I forgot my power adapter for European sockets. I wasn&#8217;t too happy about that. I was even less happy when I realized (sitting in the waiting lounge for the flight) that I&#8217;d also forgotten my iPod headphones. Just before a 9.5 hour flight. Colour me unhappy. Thankfully, the Duty Free shop sold power adapters (which I needed) and I picked a really cheap (in price and quality, sadly) headphones to get me through the flights there and back.<br />
Boarding, I sat in the wrong seat. Why, I don&#8217;t know. First time for me. And of course, when I had a plethora of things that I had to put away. The seat I was assigned to (an aisle) was occupied. Three girls were travelling together and one asked if I could take her seat so she could sit with her friends. I had immediate images of being wedged in the middle seat of a centre row next to a screaming baby. Thankfully, it was a two-seat row window seat, next to a cryobiologist from Edmonton. How&#8217;s that for a cool profession? (Yeah, I know, dumb joke.) I don&#8217;t think there was a single baby on the plane, actually. I didn&#8217;t hear one, anyway.<br />
I worked for the next few hours, in between the meagre meals. I find writing emails, especially to one&#8217;s boss, is much easier after a couple of beers. And at high altitude. Helped me sleep for about an hour, too. That helped, since the flight left at 18:30 and didn&#8217;t arrive until 03:30 or so (Calgary time, that is).<br />
We flew northish, crossing over the southern end of Greenland. I saw my first iceberg from about 37,000 feet up. The sun never set, due partly to the time of year and partly to the altitude &#8212; it remained reasonably bright right through the flight. At least until everyone closed their blinds for a couple of hours of rest. I had to sit back and rest then, too, as the entire cabin went dark. Overall, a much better flight than the one to England back in April &#8212; this gave us more than enough time to sleep, even if just a little.<br />
At Frankfurt Airport, I had just under 40 minutes to find my connecting flight. First, Frankfurt Airport is <em>huge</em>. Second, it&#8217;s really poorly labelled. I had to find Gate A36. In most airports that I&#8217;ve been to, it&#8217;s not a problem. In this one, it was a problem. I was told &#8220;upstairs and follow the signs&#8221;.<br />
Allow me to give you more specific instructions. Up the stairs, 300 metres down the corridor, down a short hall to your left, then turn around right and get in the Non-EU Resident line for customs. (Yes, I cleared in Germany. No French stamp for me.) The customs was a joke. The guard looked actually bored. Two questions: Where are you going? Business or pleasure? That was it. Literally. Nothing else, even when I said I was going on business! That elicits a half-hour interview with armed soliders when you try to go to the States! Once through there, down the stairs, following signs that say &#8220;Gates A1 &#8211; 19&#8221;, despite previous signs that said &#8220;A1 &#8211; 54&#8221;. Then through security.<br />
Once through security, turn right and walk past the customs lines for the &#8220;B&#8221; gates. This arcs around until you get to elevators that go down to the underground tunnel between the two terminal buildings. You can also take the stairs, which are far faster. Then you walk down a 600 metre long tunnel (with moving sidewalks and nicely lit, I must add) before reaching elevators on the other side. Then up (I took the stairs again) to the hallway, hang a left, and walk down another 400-500 metres of airway until you find your gate.<br />
Thankfully, the flight was delayed 30 minutes.<br />
Lufthansa runs a nice flight. It was barely a third full. And despite the relatively short flight (about 90 minutes), I got a drink, sandwich (cheese on dense German bread), and a little chocolate bar. Air Canada &#8212; take note of how your alliance partner treats their guests on short-haul flights! You could learn a lot from these guys!<br />
Charles du Galle Airport is huge. One of Europe&#8217;s largest. It took a fair bit of walking to get to the baggage carousel. It took even longer to find the way out. For reasons I don&#8217;t fully understand, Terminal 1 isn&#8217;t connected to the rail system. So everyone shuffles to Terminal 3 via shuttle bus. And the rail connection isn&#8217;t easy to navigate unless you&#8217;ve done your research a bit. And you stand in line for over a half hour waiting to get a ticket because the ticket dispensing machines need European Visa cards &#8212; North American ones don&#8217;t work. (Go figure.)<br />
The RER trains are regular, and the trip takes about 45 minutes to downtown Paris. Sadly, the trains are not well-kept. I would put them as the poorest condition of any train I&#8217;ve ridden anywhere in the world. The stench of stale urine didn&#8217;t help any, either. I&#8217;ve heard this happens, but was still amazed. The trip was punctuated by people begging for spare change.<br />
Chatelet-des-Halles (the stop after Gare du Nord) is the second-largest train station in the world after Shinjuku, Tokyo. On the surface, you&#8217;d never know. But underground, it&#8217;s a connection between several train and Metro lines. And it&#8217;s a zoo. Carrying my rather awkward bag all that distance was no fun at all, and I&#8217;m not looking forward to leaving that way (I have little choice, and given it&#8217;s proximity to my hotel, I&#8217;d be stupid to go elsewhere). It took 15 minutes just to get out of the station, it&#8217;s that big.<br />
Thankfully, that left me with a 30 second walk to my hotel. I was in my air-conditioned room mere minutes later, revelling in the fact that I was no longer melting in the 33-degree heat of the city. My shirt was soaked.<br />
I immediately had to call Jaime to make plans for the evening. Which meant calling international to her cell phone, despite the fact that she lives 10 minutes from my hotel. (I love technology!) I had until 19:30, when she&#8217;d be more free, so I went for a wander. After all, I&#8217;ve never been to Paris before!<br />
The HÃ´tel des Ducs d&#8217;Anjou is a five minute walk to the Seine and the Louvre, about 10 minutes to Notre-Dame, and mired in the middle of a lot of cafes. I can hardly complain about its location. I decided to walk to the Seine and decide where it would take me from there. It wasn&#8217;t long before I was facing the west facade of Notre Dame Cathedral. The square in front of it was full of people, most just sitting around, talking, and viewing the sites. I passed by, taking a closer look at the facade before moving around the south side towards the east end. Crossing the bridge, I came back across the bridge, returning to Place Notre-Dame. There I waited until the cloud that had been sitting in front of the sun finally cleared so I could get a nice picture in the sunshine.<br />
Returning to the south side (the Left Bank, I believe), I walked down the river, past the countless booksellers with their dark green display boxes until I reached Pont Neuf. I returned to the north side again and headed back to the hotel.<br />
Jaime was a bit late arriving due to her meetings and a non-exact idea of where exactly the hotel was. We were soon weaving our way through the many narrow roads that make up this area of Paris, trying to find the ideal cafe to sit and have our meeting. The first place was hardly what I&#8217;d had in mind (the menu listed &#8220;pork meat&#8221;, which even in French didn&#8217;t strike me as great). The second was much better.<br />
Sadly, our meeting didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. Namely that I nearly face-planted my dinner from exhaustion. A bed never felt so good before.<br />
