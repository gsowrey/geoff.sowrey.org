								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I&#8217;ve been wrestling with the Calgary Board of Education</strong> for a couple of years, now. And it&#8217;s not for anything complicated. To be honest, all I have is a simple hope: to have my children go to a school where they don&#8217;t have to worry about if they&#8217;re staying in the school, or if there will be a school at all. Note that this is a &#8220;hope&#8221;, not anything more concrete&#8230;<br />
Over the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve come to realize a few nasty things about <strong>how the public education system works in this city</strong>. The internals of the <strong>CBE are highly secretive</strong> (finding out who is actually in charge of certain things is about as easy as learning the inner workings of CSIS), and so intensely political that decisions appear to be made utterly at random, against student interests. None of this seems to go through check-and-balance because &#8230; well, <strong>there&#8217;s no accountability to anyone</strong>, nor does anyone take responsibility.<br />
As a result <strong>the CBE, as a whole, is failing</strong>. And that needs to change.<br />
<span id="more-3432"></span>The system is split into <strong>three basic parts</strong>: <strong>the teachers</strong> (who generally do an exemplary job, given limited resources), the <strong>board administration</strong> (at this point, pretty much the polar opposite of the teachers), and the <strong>Board of Trustees</strong> (elected, but ineffectual).<br />
The teachers are, at the heart of the CBE, the gears that allow the machine to move forward. (I&#8217;m sure the board administration would say it&#8217;s them. It&#8217;s not.) So <strong>we&#8217;re not going to worry too much about the teachers</strong>. Yes, we can delve into the problems of tenure and people past their prime, but those folks have a limited impact.<br />
And while I would love to (figuratively and literally)<strong> throw the administration under a bus</strong>, that&#8217;s a tough challenge. While I see <strong>utterly inept planning</strong> (bordering on outright lying, which I&#8217;ve had happen to my face), <strong>impenetrable organization</strong>, <strong>unavailable communication</strong>, and <strong>top-down decision-making</strong> that gets dictated without input from the bottom, these are not things that we cannot change without pressure from someone else with authority.<br />
And authority, at least with the CBE, seems to necessarily involve the one holding the purse strings.<br />
Every year, the <strong><a href="http://www.cbe.ab.ca/about-us/budget-and-finance/Documents/Budget-Briefing-April-6-2015.pdf" target="_blank">CBE receives about $1.25 <em>billion</em> a year</a></strong> for operating the schools in Calgary. That translates into over $9,000 per student (CBE&#8217;s own numbers). Obviously, each student doesn&#8217;t see that funding, that&#8217;s just an average. Those dollars are broken down into how the CBE operates.<br />
However, <strong>there is considerable concern</strong> (largely from parents) that the Resource Allocation Method (an algorithm that apparently is subject to privacy laws, so parents can&#8217;t actually see it) is funnelling away funds from schools back into the CBE &#8230; for <em>something</em>.<br />
It&#8217;s the vagueness that&#8217;s driving a lot of concerned parents (and yes, I am one) a bit off the edge. <strong>The CBE is protecting their own information for unknown purposes.</strong> They won&#8217;t even disclose the reasons why. It&#8217;s like asking your child why they broke your favourite lamp, and with pieces of said broken lamp in their hands, they respond: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it&#8221;.<br />
<strong>The CBE is not transparent</strong> when it comes to funding. Not even close. They&#8217;re quick to pull the &#8220;privacy&#8221; card and not discuss the details. Details that, ultimately, concern the very they&#8217;re supposedly protecting. (I do have to ask exactly <em>how</em> my child&#8217;s name has been directly attached to operating budgets. That seems a bit <em>wrong</em> to me.)<br />
This all happens for one simple reason: <strong>no-one is telling the CBE they&#8217;re doing it wrong</strong>. Or to be more specific, no-one with <em>authority</em>.<br />
Supposedly, that&#8217;s what the <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/872020/what-does-a-school-board-trustee-actually-do/" target="_blank">CBE&#8217;s Board of Trustees</a> is supposed to do. That&#8217;s why we elect them. Except that over many years,<strong> it&#8217;s become exceptionally hard to actually <em>trust</em> our trustees</strong>. There&#8217;s issues of transparency, <a href="http://metronews.ca/news/calgary/963030/accusations-fly-during-impromptu-calgary-board-of-education-trustee-call-to-metro-reporter/" target="_blank">being belligerent to the media</a>, ignoring parents (this one I&#8217;ve experienced myself), and <a href="https://www.google.ca/webhp?q=cbe+board+trustees+%22closed+door%22+-cbe.ab.ca" target="_blank">controversial &#8220;closed door&#8221; matters</a>. It also doesn&#8217;t help that the Board of Trustees apparently voted out their own authority, putting into the hands of the CBE&#8217;s Chief Superintendent. You know, the head of the very group the Board of Trustees is supposed to monitor?<br />
I think there&#8217;s a better approach: put the very people who have the most vested interest in the CBE&#8217;s operations as oversight. <strong>We, the parents.</strong><br />
Every year, in every single CBE school across the city, we elect a Parent Council. Every Parent Council follows a set of operating rules, which includes the election of a <strong>Chair of the Parent Council</strong>.<br />
<strong>I propose that these Chairs then form a CBE Parent Chair Council</strong>, a group that meets month (or as needed, if matters dictate) to deal with larger issues. They are the ones tasked with broadcasting information from the CBE operations down to the parents of their respective schools. They also help communicate the specific issues from their schools back to the Council.<br />
The Parent Chair Council, in turn, elects from themselves a Board of Governors. The Board of Governors are the replacement for the current Board of Trustees. But this is not a one-for-one swap, as that achieves only a little. In addition to the <strong>establishment of a parent-run Board of Governors</strong>, we bestow upon them the <em>authority</em> to demand information from the CBE, to which the CBE must comply. (This is something the province needs to enact, as the CBE itself will not change without outside influence.)<br />
Already I can hear the complaints: <strong>How is this any different than the mess we currently have?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Parents with children <em>currently </em>in the CBE are in control.</strong> Once children have left the CBE, parents become (necessarily) disengaged.</li>
<li>The election of the Board of Governors is an extension of the election of the Chair of a given school&#8217;s Parent Council: <strong>parents putting trust in one of <em>their own</em></strong> to represent them.</li>
<li><strong>Any member of the Board of Governors can be ousted at any time</strong> by the <em>current</em> rules that elect a Chair of Parent Council: someone who loses the trust in their school&#8217;s parents would be voted out at the school level, thereby removing that Chair from both the Parent Chair Council and the Board of Governors.</li>
<li><strong>Real authority would be given</strong> (again, requiring provincial mandate) that would allow the Board of Governors to truly <em>govern</em> the CBE (see, there&#8217;s a reason for the name!). I know this is a sticky part, but I do not see it as unrealistic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, one major point I know some will raise: <strong>where would people find the time to do all of this?</strong> I mean, being on the Board of Governors is a lot of work, right?<br />
Yes, it is. Two counters to that point, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Board of Trustees already invest a fair bit of time</strong> with the existing situation. So it&#8217;s not unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>There are parents in this city who are more than willing to invest that time</strong> because they <em>believe</em>. Every school has a few of these people, and interestingly, they&#8217;re often ones who put themselves up for election as the Chair of their Parent Council.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other obvious elephant is <strong>the teeth the province needs to bestow upon the Board of Governors</strong>. This is not a trivial aspect, but it is something that can be readily defined. It&#8217;s not like we don&#8217;t see similar constructs for other &#8220;watchdog&#8221; agencies who ultimately can deliver painful judgements against governments and/or industries.<br />
It is time for the <strong>parents to take back their schools</strong>, and require more of an organization that demands more and more, while delivering less and less. Parents get engaged very quickly, and can do a far better job as a collective interest than <strong>long-standing obstacles who march only to their political aspirations</strong>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><em>[It should go without saying that this is an opinion piece: my opinion. It may not be yours. Politically, I&#8217;ve been centre most of my life. Today? I genuinely don&#8217;t know.]</em></p>
<p class="p1">Alberta has entered another provincial election, our fifth since the beginning of the millennium (that’s every <i>three years</i>, on average). And in <strong>Alberta, a province of wealth and entitlement</strong>, that means the old guard fending off competitors who dare lay siege to the castle, <strong>replete with feces-slinging</strong> (we’re well past mere mud), ethically-laden promises, and scare tactics, from all sides.</p>
<p class="p1">Canada is also heading down the road to a <strong>federal election</strong>, which by schedule we will see this fall. We will likely see <strong>the same slinging and fearmongering</strong>, not only because the same mentalities are at play, but because we’ve been witnessing the preamble for several months, now.</p>
<p class="p1">And all of it has shown one thing: that <strong>our politicians have forgotten about Canadians</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span id="more-3428"></span>The squabbling alone is like <strong>listening to the group of neighbourhood kids fight over a favoured toy</strong>. The younger ones are petulant, the older ones use their physical strength and bully to get their way. Some of the other kids in between ages argue logically, but receive neither support nor a sympathetic ear. All I hear, as the parent who wishes them to sort anything out, is crying, fighting, and threats of tattling to parents.</p>
<p class="p1">The same thing happens in our political landscape, just without the benefit of (somewhat) impartial parents to sort out the mess and restore order. The parents we should have — <strong>the Canadian people</strong>, acting through an election — <strong>have become disillusioned, disaffected, and apathetic</strong>. As a whole, we have stopped caring. And as much as I, and others, have tried to blame this on the Canadian people, the reality is that we cannot blame the people. Individual persons, perhaps, but as a collective, the Canadian people have lost faith in government.</p>
<p class="p1">For a person to care, they <strong>need to feel attachment</strong> to something. To get that attachment, we need three things, in order:</p>
<h2 class="p1">Vision</h2>
<p class="p1">Most important of any politician’s toolbelt should be a concept of what they want to achieve, something that they know their constituents need. Sadly, most politicians fall short into short-term or simple goals: lower taxes (which politicians never lower), more jobs (which politicians don’t control), better education (which politicians take neither accountability nor responsibility), and so forth. <strong>We’ve all heard these promises, every single election.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">These are not visions, <strong>these are <em>tactics</em></strong>. Real vision comes from things that are far more intangible, such as understanding the division between the wealthy and the poor, looking to the health and welfare not of today’s children but those who will come in two generations, looking at how we are truly perceived on a global stage and knowing we could be better, preparing for a world with an ever-expanding population with less space.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Our governments do not offer vision. They offer fear.</strong> Ruling parties tell us we are in danger, so take away the freedoms of the many to benefit the extremely few; they tell us we cannot have sustainable incomes from a consistent tax base, to placate business, they tell us that the present is failing and sacrifice our future. Our opposing parties are no better, instead choosing to define themselves only by how they will reverse ruling party’s efforts, or how they will do things different.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Such actions offer no inspiration, no dreams, no hope.</strong> They serve only to oppress and defeat, leaving Canadians with nothing more than apathy. Without vision, we fall into mere name-calling, and petty arguments. We don’t have anything new to believe in, so we fall back on what we already believe, regardless of how flawed it may be. And we’ll fight to the death to protect those beliefs, because <strong>we’re human, and we loathe others telling us what to believe</strong> in the absence of new thought.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Charisma</h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Part of the problem of vision, even when it is available, is an inability to connect with Canadians. While making public appearances, they certainly glad-hand everyone they can find with big, wide smiles … but this is not a connection. After such events, <strong>Canadians will no more relate to a politician as they will to the politician in a sound bite on TV</strong>. We relate better to actors in trashy B-movies than we do the people we’re supposed to trust with our future. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The leader of our nation, Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper, has the <strong>personality of a cardboard cutout</strong>. Hon. Thomas Mulcair, the leader of the official opposition, is <strong>identifiable more by his beard</strong> than anything he has said or done. And our supposed saviour, Hon. Justin Trudeau, scion of Canadian political legend, has somehow managed to turn himself into a bizarre punchline, where lately his <strong>only defining attribute is reverse-parroting</strong> nearly everything the Prime Minister says. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Nevermind our provincial woes: a recently-elected Premier who, starting off with supposedly open eyes, has turned a deaf ear; the official opposition imploded; and <strong>the polls show the province tearing itself down the middle</strong>, with divisions widening daily. There is not a single person who has stepped up within the province to show a new way to think, nothing beyond promises of old that have been broken time and time again. <strong>Not a single party who defines hope</strong>, not a single hope for the change we so desperately need. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Sadly, <strong>our politicians appear to have started to ignore us</strong>. They only truly care when elections are in the wind, for obvious reasons. Otherwise, they&#8217;re more preoccupied with each other, with in-fighting, name-calling, petty one-up-manship, and throwing people under busses (figuratively speaking that is; if that ever turns literal, we&#8217;ll have bigger problems to solve). The net result isn&#8217;t even entertainment, anymore. It&#8217;s irritation.</p>
<p class="p1">Worse still, we <strong>Canadians still end up dividing on ideological lines</strong>, blindly painting ourselves Blue, Red, and Orange because &#8230; well, because that party is how I&#8217;d <em>like</em> to think. But that paint is a two-way street, and <strong>the actions and words of the politicians flows down to the people</strong>, tarnishing the ideal of what that paint was supposed to be, and the Painted People argue about what&#8217;s ideal, despite the reality.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s not like Canada has not seen charismatic, even idiosyncratic politicians before. I&#8217;ll sidestep an obvious one, largely because my province has a ridiculously long memory and a terribly short sight.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Instead, I&#8217;ll look to the late <strong>Hon. Jack Layton, who set a benchmark in Canada</strong> for the very things that Canadians were longing for: helping Canadians, not scaring them. He ignored personal attacks, choosing instead to inspire. He made fun of himself on <i>This Hour Has 22 Minutes</i>, engaged Quebecois in their language, and despite a strange police run-in (an unproven but suspected smear campaign), his trustworthiness amongst those polled topped out at 97%. In the following election, the NDP — the “left wing” party, formerly the butt of many political jokes — became the official opposition for the first time in federal politics. When Layton died in August 2011, the nation mourned the loss of <strong>our last great statesman</strong>.</span></p>
<h2 class="p1">Leadership</h2>
<p class="p1">This leads me to the last major problem with our politicians: their inability to lead. They are defined as leaders of their respective parties certainly — they are elected from within the party for that very purpose. That does not, however, necessarily define them as leaders of Canadians.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine, if you will, a crowd in a large field. A single person steps from the crowd, raises their hand, and promptly marches off in a direction. Some of the crowd will undoubtedly follow, either because they know the person or because they have a like mind. The rest may follow over time, some due to not wishing to remain in the field, some due to the pressure of others leaving. Some will remain, and possibly follow someone else who marches off in a different direction.</p>
<p class="p1">Now imagine that same crowd in a dark tunnel. There are two ways to go, and almost no-one knows the right way. One person, armed with a flashlight, walks ahead to look for dangers: open holes, tripping rocks, unstable walls, and so forth. Nearly all will follow, if just not to be left in the dark.</p>
<p class="p1">These are the <strong>two leadership patterns we see in Canada: follow by choice, or follow by fear</strong>. Both are problematic, though most people, when asked, would prefer the choice. It doesn’t matter whether or not your choice may lead you off a cliff, you just wish to know that you feel right about something. In both cases, <strong>the key missing element is education</strong>. With fear, you’re offering only the downside: follow me, or else. With choice, you’re selling only the benefits: follow me, for I have cookies!</p>
<p class="p1">So what’s best? <strong>Follow by understanding.</strong> Yes, we have cookies, and they are delicious, but some have raisins, and we know they’re not for everyone. Allow people to know what you stand for, why that matters, why you think you’ll make mistakes, where you will draw lines, and how much you’re willing to risk to bring your vision. <strong>A rare politician is one who does not worry immediately about the next election</strong>, but more about the people they represent.</p>
<h2 class="p1">But Where’s the Proof?</h2>
<p class="p1">It took me a long time to realize that we had an example of how it <i>could</i> be done. And, somewhat ironically, it exists in a place we don&#8217;t expect to see greatness: in municipal government. I can look at my own city and see the proof. Calgary is a microcosm of Canada: a right-leaning, multi-cultural, fast-growing city that has, historically, had a lacklustre governing body.</p>
<p class="p1">Until 2012, the general impression of City Council was anything but transparent, ruled largely by old guard red tape, with but a few who fought for real change. Then in 2012, the change happened: a man with a vision of what Calgary could be, that flew in the face of some of that old guard, asked <strong>people to believe not necessarily <em>in</em> him, but <em>with</em> him</strong>. And people could, because he had a personality that was infectious, one that made you <em>want</em> to believe. He followed through, showing people how things could really be done.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Mayor Naheed Nenshi proved to a right-leaning city that had stopped caring, that you <i>could</i> do different.</strong> For his first term, Calgary became a very different place. It felt more energetic, more interesting and vibrant, more passionate. He did so well, that he got reelected. He continues to express his opinions, his vision, his desire for change, and his will to put himself out for public approval.</p>
<p class="p1">Is Mayor Nenshi popular with everyone? Of course he isn’t — he rubs some people badly, and they would love to see him unseated. And, to some degree, Mayor Nenshi doesn’t seem to care. <strong>Opposition is seen as a healthy thing, to foster debate, to find middle grounds, to develop long-lasting solutions.</strong> And despite perceptions of some city councillors working more for corporate interests than their constituents, the City of Calgary functions more like the Canada I knew as a child: with mutual respect, honest debate, and a desire to do Calgarians proud.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>This is what our politicians are missing: pride.</strong> They’ve forgotten how to inspire through vision, engage through charisma, and gain a following through leadership. This Alberta election is a farce, and our next federal election will be like watching poo-flinging monkeys.</p>
<p class="p1">Our only hope is that someone recognizes this, and brings change.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Mr. Trudeau,<br />
First off, thank you for putting yourself on the line for leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. Names notwithstanding, <strong>the act is one that is necessarily of self-sacrifice</strong>, since the job of leading is often thankless, rarely appreciated for what it delivers, and may very well likely make you age before your time. It is the call of duty that is more admirable, that you would take on a responsibility that <strong>most Canadians would prefer to avoid</strong>. It will be refreshing to have a younger perspective on what has become a party bogged down in its past mistakes, real and perceived, and how that party could be transformed into something more relevant.<br />
It is that relevance of which I am concerned. I am currently sitting in <strong>Calgary Centre, awaiting the outcome of a by-election</strong>. It&#8217;s been an interesting contest, and to some degree, has become even a microcosm of what we&#8217;ve seen across Canada. <strong>The same messages, the same tactics, and the same mistakes.</strong> It will be a turning point, of that I have little doubt, even if (regrettably) the &#8220;status quo&#8221; is maintained &#8212; there are lessons to be learned, here, Mr. Trudeau. And a very important one to which you need to pay very close attention:<br />
<strong>Votes do not &#8220;split&#8221;.</strong><br />
<span id="more-3190"></span><br />
This has been heard for decades in Canada &#8212; I remember this from when you and I were children (we are of the same era): people worried that <strong>unless there was some form of unity</strong>, people would split votes in the wrong place, and <strong>the &#8220;wrong&#8221; side would win an election</strong>. Indeed, with the way our electoral system works, association to a &#8220;right&#8221; or &#8220;left&#8221; tends to lead to a &#8220;right&#8221; victory, merely due to lack of options; the &#8220;left&#8221; necessarily loses due to dilution.<br />
And here we arrive at the abhorrent use of &#8220;splitting votes&#8221;, which I&#8217;ve heard far too many times over the last few weeks. And nearly every single one of these utterances seemed to come from the Liberal candidate. He has been using <strong>fear as his tactic</strong>, to convince potential voters in Calgary Centre that if they didn&#8217;t vote for him, that the Converative would win (effectively) by default. <strong>If this is the sign of the Liberal strategy</strong> to come, Mr. Trudeau, then do yourself a favour and <strong>please step down</strong>. The Trudeau name has stood for far greater things than that, and it does not need to be sullied by pedantic schoolyard wailing.<br />
<em>Votes do not split</em>, Mr. Trudeau. You know this to be true. If you fear a split vote, what you are really fearing is that <strong>no-one comprehends your political platform</strong>, that your message is not understood or not liked, and that you are failing to inspire people to listen. The only outcome of such lack of clarity and focus is a lack of support. <strong>Unity does not come from saying that other options are worse</strong> than your own mess of a statement.<br />
Far too often, journalists and politicians alike shoehorn Canadians into either the &#8220;left&#8221; or the &#8220;right&#8221; sides when it comes to politics, to the detriment of reason. Reason &#8212; and history &#8212; state that we <strong>Canadians believe in people and ideas</strong>, that given a strong leader, we will gladly follow. This has happened since the days of Confederation, and has happened ever since. It is when <strong>we <em>lack</em> a strong leader</strong> that we founder, and allow fear to make our decisions for us.<br />
<strong>You remember Mr. Layton.</strong> He may very well be remembered for more than a generation for a single election, a singular point in Canadian political history when he side-stepped fear, and instead did something that no other political has dared attempt in a very long time: <strong>he made us dream</strong>. He made us smile at the thought of hope. And then he made us want it so badly that <em>tens of thousands</em> of Canadians &#8212; myself included &#8212; voted differently than we had before. He went beyond the name-calling and past the mudslinging, and went directly to the people and asked them to think of a Canada that we&#8217;ve <em>all</em> been longing to see again, one we&#8217;ve thought lost. <strong>Losing Mr. Layton has turned out to be a tremendous tragedy for Canada</strong>, for we lost our path to that future, and are again struggling in the dark.<br />
So what say you, Mr. Trudeau? Will you follow the same steps, dancing to the same tune? Or <strong>will you dare to sing of higher standards</strong>? Will you take your party into the future by making Canadians want to believe? Will you inspire them to feel civic duty again, get out of their homes and vote? Will you <strong>restore a belief in our nation</strong> that is not challenged by Federal draconianism, where Canadians come before corporations, and we do not fear for our children&#8217;s future?<br />
So why you? <strong>Why not say this openly to all of our political leaders?</strong> To all the candidates of the Liberal leadership? If they choose to listen, we will all be better for it, but it&#8217;s been clear that few would. <strong>They continue to use fear to isolate</strong>, not encourage. This is why Mr. Layton&#8217;s message was so well-received &#8212; <strong>we&#8217;re tired of the isolation</strong>, and we want to live together as a nation.<br />
I&#8217;ve chosen you because of your background, not just as the son of a former Prime Minister, but one who has experienced the youth programmes, the political and ideological differences (let alone lingua franca), has lived the life of a politician for a few years and still retains <strong>the burning fire to do better</strong>. That&#8217;s the same burning desire we all need to feel. You have presence in parliament, Canadian politics, and &#8212; especially &#8212; of mind. Someone who is recognized by many, and <strong>a voice that can be heard in the dark</strong>.<br />
The Liberal party stands as perhaps the only party than can effectively bridge the &#8220;left&#8221; and &#8220;right&#8221; sides of our country, <strong>avoiding the extremism that comes from both sides</strong>. Conservative elements distrustful of perceived rampant social spending, Progressives terrified of living in a gestapo nation. A message of hope from the centre will succeed, but <strong>the centre needs to have hope</strong>. And all we see right now is the fear of division.<br />
<strong>Hope eradicates fear.</strong> It gives us reason to rise in the morning, helps us look beyond our troubling present to see future solutions, allows us to believe in something that goes beyond ourselves. We need to hope that there is something better, something more meaningful.<br />
You stepped to the podium, Mr. Trudeau. <strong>I hope you have something worth hearing.</strong></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t caught wind of this, Alberta&#8217;s in an election again. It&#8217;s a fairly depressing event, as I&#8217;m realising that I&#8217;m actually having to consider the Less of Two Evils and lean towards the incumbent PC just to avoid the potential idiocy of the upstart Wildrose.<br />
Anyway, one topic that&#8217;s come up a few times is the issue of royalty rates that companies pay to extract oil from the oil sands. The NDP (who&#8217;ll never see office in this province) want to raise the rates, the Liberals waffle, and both the PC and the Wildrose are adamant that the rates not change. It got me to wondering: are our rates even remotely fair?<br />
To paraphrase Adam West&#8217;s Batman: To the internet!<br />
<span id="more-3041"></span>&#8220;Fair&#8221;, as we all know, is highly subjective. But we&#8217;re talking the use of a natural resource, and a reasonable compensation for its acquisition. The best other example of a (current) use of a natural resource is logging in British Columbia. (Yes, mining would be much more comparable, but mining has pretty much all but collapsed in British Columbia.) So I wondered &#8212; is Alberta getting for its oil what BC gets for its trees?<br />
Okay, so this information is a bit tricky to find, and even harder to compare. So let&#8217;s consider the realities first. I&#8217;m going to compare the rates at which BC collects revenue for trees harvested in 2010, and the revenue Alberta collected from extracted bitumen (the oil sands) in 2010. Both will be measured in cubic metres, since there&#8217;s no way to compare them otherwise (trees are in cubic metres, but oil is measured in BBLs, which is some typically archaic measurement &#8212; more on that later).<br />
Let&#8217;s do trees first. They&#8217;re easier.<br />
British Columbia harvests a lot of trees (for better or for worse). Despite the environmental issues surrounding logging, I find harvesting trees to be a (relatively) good industry, in that it&#8217;s an organic product that tends to grow back.<br />
BC charges what it is called a &#8220;stumpage fee&#8221; for cutting down a tree. This not only generates revenue for the province, but likely also keeps entire forests from disappearing due to the inevitable cost. Those fees vary throughout the year due to market influences, as well as where the tree was cut down &#8212; it costs more to cut down a coastal tree than it does an interior tree.<br />
In 2010, British Columbia reported a <a href="http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/ftp/het/external/!publish/web/snapshot/201103.pdf">softwood lumber production of 27 million cubic metres</a>. Fees ranged from $5.34 at the start of 2010 to about $6.87 at the end of year on the coast; the interior ranged from $4.06 down to $3.52 in the interior.<br />
I could go rather insane on the dynamics of cost variations and how to calculate a reasonable average &#8230; but you&#8217;ll find I don&#8217;t need to go to that level of detail. I couldn&#8217;t find a total revenue from felling trees, but apparently in 2010, the Ministry of Forest, Lands and Natural Resources (who collects the stumpage fees) collected merely $433 million.<br />
Okay, now let&#8217;s talk oil.<br />
This one, as I said, is a bit trickier because it&#8217;s not actually easy to find the collective output from Alberta per year. It&#8217;s important because royalties are charged on different rates depending on the investment a given company has made, how long it&#8217;s been there, and even if the rates are grandfathered from much earlier negotiations. And frankly, I&#8217;m not an expert, so me trying to decipher all of this before the election seems really hard.<br />
Anyway&#8230;<br />
According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, the <a href="http://www.capp.ca/aboutUs/mediaCentre/NewsReleases/Pages/2010-Oil-Forecast.aspx">average oil sands production was 1.5 million barrels/day in 2010</a>. (Admittedly, that link is for a forecast, but it was made halfway through 2010, so I imagine it&#8217;s not far off.) That works out to  547.5 million barrels for 2010 (give or take a couple million). Using a standard measurement of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrel_(unit)">158.9873 L per barrel</a>, that gives us 87.04554675 billion litres of oil sands production, or 87.04 million cubic metres.<br />
Revenue from the oil sands (in the way of royalties) was <a href="http://www.energy.alberta.ca/oilsands/791.asp">more than $3.7 billion</a>. That equates to roughly $42.51 per cubic metre in revenues. Nearly ten times what BC gets for its trees. (Minor detail: BC&#8217;s trees grow back. Oil doesn&#8217;t.)<br />
I&#8217;m reticent to draw a conclusion here, mostly because the numbers just somehow feel wrong. I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ve got them calculated right, but &#8230; well, I guess Alberta doesn&#8217;t have that much to complain about, at least comparatively speaking? I&#8217;d still argue for a higher rate (when the oil runs out, Alberta might not be any better off than Dubai, just without the mega malls, insanely tall towers, and uber-opulence), and invest that in our future.<br />
But at least for the present, maybe we&#8217;re doing alright?<br />
(Disclaimer: I had the hypothesis that tree stumpage fees were higher. I honestly felt &#8212; and still feel &#8212; that the royalty rates are too low. So I fully expected oil to come in way under trees &#8230; probably why the numbers don&#8217;t feel right to me. I&#8217;m happy to be corrected!)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll keep this one short folks, I promise.<br />
Do you use the internet (even watching videos on YouTube and Facebook counts)? Do you use an iPod/iPhone/iWhatever? Do you watch downloaded movies? Are you a student (or thinking of going back to school)? Then you&#8217;d better pay very close attention, because your beloved Federal Government under Stephen Harper is about to <strong>pull the rug out from under you</strong>.<br />
If you somehow missed the bruhaha over the United States&#8217; failed SOPA bill, you cannot afford to miss Canada&#8217;s attempt at the same thing. We&#8217;re very close to passing bill C-11, a bill sponsored by big media (notably movie studios, the music industry, and publishing giants) who want to <strong>control the way you access your music, TV, and books</strong>. They want this control because they are unable to cope with the digital economy, and want the Government to create laws that heavily restrict your actions, and impose ridiculous punishment.<br />
Now I am no expert on these things, but I read someone who is: <a href="http://www.commonlaw.uottawa.ca/en/michael-geist.html" target="_blank">Professor Michael Geist of the University of Ottawa, the Canada Research Chair of Internet and E-Commerce Law</a>. (I mean, really, could you possibly get anyone better?) He has written some excellent articles on just how <em>bad</em> C-11 is &#8212; and has been very clear on how it could be improved so it&#8217;s not so terrible. (The Government, to no surprise, is not listening.)<br />
I offer you the following from Geist&#8217;s blog. The intros here are my paraphrased summaries of the articles.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6307/125/" target="_blank">Mr. Geist&#8217;s response to the CRIA (Canadian Recording Industry Association)&#8217;s op-ed saying that C-11 isn&#8217;t that bad (as you can guess, it<em> really is</em> that bad)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6033/125/" target="_blank">The politics behind why Canada is keeping digital lock rules that will greatly hamper fair use of video, music, and books. That means: no more funny YouTube videos, and good luck at quoting books or articles for your research papers.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6287/125/" target="_blank">The Canadian music industry threatens critics of C-11, effectively branding them as criminals. It&#8217;s the moronic &#8220;you&#8217;re either with or, or against us&#8221; stance.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6275/125/" target="_blank">Mr. Geist asks ten key questions of the various copyright agreements. The answers aren&#8217;t pretty.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6257/125/" target="_blank">What&#8217;s going on behind closed doors, and how these bills are ending up in our Legislature.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6264/125/" target="_blank">Could YouTube become illegal in Canada?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/6243/125/" target="_blank">How US lobbyists are pressuring the US Government to exclude Canada from international agreements because we haven&#8217;t bowed to their demands. Worse still, they refuse to allow for any cultural considerations (remember, we are a multicultural nation!)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And he also visited with <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/strombo/technology-1/soapbox-michael-geist-on-bill-c-11.html" target="_blank">Strombo on the CBC to talk about C-11</a>. It&#8217;s less than two minutes, and it explains just about everything. Even if you don&#8217;t read the above articles, <strong>you really should watch this video</strong>.<br />
In short, our beloved Government is refusing to adopt the perspective that they <strong>represent the Canadian people</strong>. They are preferring to listen to corporations and corporate associations, and worse still &#8212; <em>foreign</em> corporations who have <em>no business</em> dictating our laws.<br />
Okay, so what do you do?<br />
First, <a href="http://openmedia.ca/lockdown" target="_blank">sign up with OpenMedia&#8217;s petition</a>. It only takes a moment, and every single little bit helps. (SOPA died in the United States because the vocal backlash was loud enough.)<br />
Then, can I suggest sending the following text to the Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper (<a href="mailto:stephen.harper@parl.gc.ca" target="_blank">stephen.harper@parl.gc.ca</a>), the  Minister of Industry and Minister of State (Agriculture) Hon. Christian Paradis (<a href="mailto:christian.paradis@parl.gc.ca" target="_blank">christian.paradis@parl.gc.ca</a>) (he&#8217;s the Minister putting C-11 forth, and hence is responsible for our impending nightmare), Nycole Turmel (<a href="mailto:nycole.turmel@parl.gc.ca" target="_blank">nycole.turmel@parl.gc.ca</a>) (she&#8217;s our official, albeit interim, Leader of the Opposition), Hon. Bob Rae (<a href="mailto:bob.rae@parl.gc.ca" target="_blank">bob.rae@parl.gc.ca</a>) (our most experienced elder statesman in Parliament), and <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/MemberByPostalCode.aspx?Menu=HOC" target="_blank">your Canadian Member of Parliament</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Gentlemen and Madams,<br />
I am writing to express my deep concern regarding Bill C-11, now put forth in our Parliament.<br />
While I am very much aware of the need to address copyright laws within Canada to ensure that they meet international agreements, the terms and conditions being put forth in C-11 appear to be overlooking the needs of the Canadian people, both in the present and in the future. These terms go far past those required by international agreement, and introduce unnecessary restriction and overly  punitive  damages.<br />
The proposed conditions are being driven primarily by corporations, and are also heavily influenced by foreign governments and foreign corporations who have no right to comment on Canada&#8217;s laws. The Canadian Federal Government is supposed to stand for its people, yet we are being considered last in this process.<br />
Please stop the blind approval of this damaging legislation and reopen it to Canadian legal experts who have offered wise and just opinion on how C-11 could still address the needs of Canadian law while not imposing unnecessary (and unfair) restrictions on law-abiding Canadians.<br />
Most sincerely,<br />
[Your name here. Please use a real one.]</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like long years. Really. Yes, I complain about when things seem to drag out far longer than they should, or if I&#8217;m busting my arse far harder than I think I should. That&#8217;s part of being human, no? In the end, though, I like long years because I get to look back and not worry about how quickly time has flown by. Time should never fly by quickly &#8212; it means I&#8217;ve missed something, and &#8230; well, darn it, I just hate missing things!<br />
This last year was a big one for me in one major way: it was a redefinition of my professional existence. Since the end of 2009, I&#8217;ve transformed from a professional manager to a &#8230; hmm &#8230; well, my title (however formal it needs to be) is &#8220;Solutions Lead&#8221;, but that belies a lot of what I do every day, and just using &#8220;web developer&#8221; or &#8220;programmer&#8221; &#8212; even with a &#8220;Senior&#8221; prefix &#8212; completely understates the reality. This year was really about taking all the skills and knowledge I&#8217;d acquired as a leader, and merging that back into my day-to-day development practices.<br />
And that, as the saying goes, was only the tip of the iceberg&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-2980"></span>I did a LOT of work. I did so much, in fact, that my contracting business is gone. Doors closed, windows shut, lights off. Permanently. I had to make a very painful call to realise that I need to focus on the three most important things in my life: my family. (There&#8217;s three of them, in case you were wondering.) To focus on them means to remove all other distractions inasmuch as is possible, and still earn a paycheque along the way (helping to support said family, of course).<br />
Add to that Alex&#8217;s return to work after nearly four years off as a Professional Mom, working evening shifts. That meant more time as a Professional Dad, whether I liked it or not. (And I like it, really. Except for dinner time. Suddenly, I have nothing but sympathy for my parents when I was a kid.) It&#8217;s adjustment, it&#8217;s growth.<br />
As a result of all of this, many things suffered. My hobbies (what few I have) were shelved &#8212; even my desire to blog waned dramatically, with more than a couple of blogless months. My TV watching fell to an all-time low, and I can count on one hand the number of movies I saw in the theatre (coincidentally, also the number of movies I watched during the Christmas break at home through iTunes). My health has also been &#8230; unattended, with a noticeable increase in girth and an unhealthy increase in my beer consumption (since decreased, thankfully).<br />
But if you were to ask me if I was &#8220;unhappy&#8221;, I&#8217;d have to say &#8220;no&#8221;. Every day, my kids remind me why I&#8217;m proud to be their dad. Every day, I get a challenge in my job. Every day, I enjoy life, even if it&#8217;s only for a few moments. To say I&#8217;m &#8220;unhappy&#8221; would be a disservice (if not an outright insult) to my daily existence, and those around me.<br />
To that end, I can safety state that I&#8217;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Been into Banff National Park on a few occasions &#8212; both warm and cold &#8212; but nowhere near enough for my liking</li>
<li>Picnicked as much as we could, but again nowhere near enough for what we could have done</li>
<li>Enjoyed the first brew from Calgary&#8217;s new Village Brewery</li>
<li>Did some renovation work in the kitchen (and planned more renovation work for this year)</li>
<li>Retaught myself the fundamentals of being a (web) developer, and merged that with the skills and knowledge of a technology director</li>
<li>Lamented as I saw Choo Choo seem to grow by leaps and bounds, going from my little baby girl to a walking, talking toddler</li>
<li>Finally accepted the truth, and got glasses</li>
<li>Came to understand my father in ways I never thought possible, and really wished that he could be here today to see how his son (kinda) grew up</li>
<li>Accepted the reality that I will only ever be a father of two beautiful girls &#8212; there will never be a third offspring</li>
<li>Watched in horror as Canada succumbed to fear mongering and elected a government that refuses to listen to its own people (a terrifyingly global trend in 2011)</li>
<li>Mourned the loss of one of Canada&#8217;s best politicians since Pierre Trudeau, the Honourable Jack Layton</li>
<li>Experienced my first general anesthesia to get my hernia repaired &#8230; boy, I do <em>not</em> want to go through that again!</li>
<li>Drank way too much coffee (yes, folks, that is possible)</li>
<li>Similarly, also drank too much beer (yes, also possible, though admittedly it tasted really good at the time)</li>
<li>Launched more projects in one year than I had launched during my busiest five years (combined) at my previous company</li>
<li>Took Monkey on the SUPER SECRET MONKEY SURPRISE &#8212; a short trip on CP 2816</li>
<li>Took Monkey to the Stampede, and realised to my delight (or possible horror, not sure yet) that she loves rides, especially roller coasters</li>
<li>Also got the Mother of All Headaches while at the Stampede&#8230;</li>
<li>Travelled to Ontario to visit with my family</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time swimming in the lake with Monkey and my nieces</li>
<li>Rode another steam train in Huntsville</li>
<li>Visited with some old and dear friends (especially Stuart and Therese)</li>
<li>Celebrated Monkey&#8217;s 4th birthday, and Choo Choo&#8217;s first birthday</li>
<li>Also rode on the Heritage Park steam train</li>
<li>Travelled to Red Deer to see the Backyardigans live (oh, the things parents must do&#8230;)</li>
<li>Travelled once again to the West Coast for post-Christmas and New Year&#8217;s celebrations</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s other stuff I did, but my blog was so light on content in 2011 that &#8230; well, I&#8217;m not sure. Sure, I can try to read Twitter, but I used that in lieu of my blog, so there&#8217;s a few thousand tweets I&#8217;d need to go over. That&#8217;s a little too much. So if I&#8217;m making any resolution this year, it&#8217;s to write more blog posts.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Federal election time here in Canada. Which means it&#8217;s a fast-and-furious stream of incoherent messaging all tantamount to white noise as the various political figures attempt to sway Canadian passions (which are, at best, as politically frigid as Winnipeg in February).<br />
Adding to all of this are, new to this run, a number of social media-style services all helping to add &#8220;information&#8221; (and likely being more like more noise to the signal) to help people align themselves with the political party of choice. I came across one, recently, and suddenly realised that despite the fact we have five major political parties vying for seats, they&#8217;re really only divided two ways.<br />
Which means you either vote Conservative, or you don&#8217;t.<br />
<span id="more-2925"></span>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not advocating voting Conservative. Frankly, I have serious misgivings of how they&#8217;ve been running things the last few years, and I would very much like them deposed from the throne. The reason I say you either vote one way or the other really boils down to a graphic presented by the <a href="http://csdc-cecd.mcgill.ca/">Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship at McGill University</a>, the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes">CBC</a>/<a href="http://elections.radio-canada.ca/">Radio Canada</a>, and the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~socsci/">Department of Social Sciences at the University of Toronto</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s part of a service they created called <a href="http://federal.votecompass.ca/">Vote Compass</a>, and it strives to help people understand our political parties. It&#8217;s important, because some of the parties are awfully darn hard to differentiate in a meaningful way. With some of the issues, it&#8217;s quite easy to see which party you should look towards. But with others, it&#8217;s more like splitting hairs. That&#8217;s why the service ends up providing 35 questions (30 general ones, 3 regarding the parties&#8217; leaders, and 2 about the parties themselves), which ultimately determine what your best political party would be.<br />
And that&#8217;s really the key thing &#8212; your local candidate, regardless of how awesome they are, ultimately contributes a seat to the overall picture, allowing a party to rule. Your individual candidate, unless they become a Cabinet Minister, is little more than a hand raised during votes and can only hope to offer changes via private member&#8217;s bills. Remember, your party has already chosen its leader, and the one leading the winning party automatically becomes prime minister. (On a cynical note, I also strongly believe that anyone voting Conservative is therefore directly a supporter of Stephen Harper.)<br />
At the end of your questions, Vote Compass produces &#8230; well, a compass, showing you which way you lean, politically-speaking. Mine (currently) looks like this:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Vote-Compass.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2928" title="Vote-Compass" src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Vote-Compass.jpg" alt="" width="471" height="471" /></a><br />
(The checkmark is me, incidentally. Yes, I&#8217;m socialist. I believe very strongly in Canada&#8217;s history of helping others, including ourselves.)<br />
See the split? See how the Conservatives are in one corner, and the other four parties are up in the other? (Given, the Liberals are much more centre, but still&#8230;) This is what I mean by &#8220;you&#8217;re either voting Conservative, or you&#8217;re not&#8221;.<br />
&#8220;But,&#8221; you say, &#8220;that&#8217;s not true! I vote for my non-Conservative party! What&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;<br />
Allow me to rephrase my point slightly, then. You either cast a vote for the Conservatives, or you cast your vote against them into a <em>diluted</em> pool.<br />
This has also been my primary gripe with the &#8220;ABC&#8221; campaign (&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything_But_Conservative">Anyone/Anything But Conservative</a>&#8220;) that has been popular in parts of Canada since the 2008 federal election. Sure, don&#8217;t vote Conservative &#8230; but now you&#8217;re spreading out a vote amongst (up to) four other parties, reducing the potential power of those votes so much that&#8230;<br />
&#8230;drum roll, please&#8230;<br />
&#8230;you end up with <strong>minority governments</strong>. Two of them so far, as a matter of fact, and from what I&#8217;ve seen, we&#8217;re likely looking at a third. Which means another call for a coalition government, which will likely be nearly as useless with all the in-fighting.<br />
This is one of those few times when I look to the American two-party system and admire its simplicity. You go one way or the other. (&#8216;Course, really, they&#8217;re all the same, just one tends to more open and honest about liking guns than the other.)<br />
What I would like is for one of the other four parties to stand out from the others, and really make themselves out to be a strong contender to the Conservatives. Although the NDP seems to be gaining some serious ground this time out, they&#8217;ll have to do something about the Prairies if they hope to make a serious run. Which, really, leaves the Liberals who don&#8217;t look to have recovered from Chrétien&#8217;s era (nor show any signs of such).<br />
Or better still, have organisations/movements like ABC pick a party. Just one. Please. The message should be &#8220;don&#8217;t vote Conservative, vote for &#8230;&#8221; so long as it&#8217;s focused. Lack of focus equals lack of success. That&#8217;s about as simple a rule as it gets, however it gets applied: in school, in business, how my kids clean up their toys. Focus, please.<br />
T minus 9 days. I actually fear for my country.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As little as a hundred years ago, North Americans lived (generally) in towns and (much smaller) cities, where it was possible to know your elected representatives personally, meet with them, and have a person-to-person chat. In the years following, our representatives have been accused more and more of being &#8220;disconnected&#8221; and &#8220;out of touch&#8221; from their constituents, as the towns and cities grow, and the number of people in a given district rise well past the point of &#8220;manageable&#8221; by a single person.<br />
The biggest problem is not really the number of people &#8212; it&#8217;s the time councillors need to connect with them all, while still doing the job for which they were elected. In a physical sense, it&#8217;s nearly impossible. Some have turned to the internet to help bridge the gap, using technology to connect.<br />
Allow me to show you an example, which I experienced today&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-2905"></span>While waiting for one of my software commits to complete, I took a few minutes to read my news feeds. One article, which caught me more than a little off-guard, was a note about <a href="http://enenews.com/recent-radioactivy-testing-vancouver-canada-shows-iodine-131-rainwater-almost-100-times-above-drinking-water-limit">radioactive particles from the Japanese Fukushima reactor appearing in Vancouver&#8217;s water supply</a>. It was surprising as no-one had really expected that to happen, and moreso because the levels were a lot higher than I would have imagined.<br />
My first thought was how that would affect the water supply in Vancouver, especially towards children (it&#8217;s already an issue in parts of Japan, and BC has already had a scare that led to a run on iodine tablets). My second thought was: the rain on this side of the Rocky Mountains often comes in from the Vancouver area.<br />
Now I &#8212; as a regular, ordinary citizen of Canada&#8217;s fourth largest city &#8212; would likely have to spend quite some time to find out where to start to see if that problem had arrived here. But I&#8217;m not &#8220;regular&#8221; &#8212; I&#8217;m highly connected. And not in the &#8220;I know people way&#8221;, I mean by the internet. And I follow my ward&#8217;s alderman, <a href="http://twitter.com/aldjohnmar">John Mar</a>, on Twitter. Who better to find out if Calgary&#8217;s at risk than one of Calgary&#8217;s tooth-and-nail fighters?<br />
I started with the simple question:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-Geoff-Sowrey_-@aldjohnmar-I-know-you_re-....jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2906" title="Twitter _ Geoff Sowrey_ @aldjohnmar I know you_re ..." src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-Geoff-Sowrey_-@aldjohnmar-I-know-you_re-....jpg" alt="" width="617" height="334" /></a><br />
Knowing that John&#8217;s a busy guy (he regularly tweets his activities; which I gotta say, it&#8217;s a very handy way of knowing what your elected representative is up to without having to call them on a regular basis), I didn&#8217;t expect an immediate response. Heck, I&#8217;d have been happy with a simple &#8220;yes/no&#8221; answer. I got John&#8217;s response just a few minutes later:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-I-don_t-know-but-....jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2909" title="Twitter _ John Mar_ @sowrey I don_t know, but ..." src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-I-don_t-know-but-....jpg" alt="" width="617" height="268" /></a><br />
Okay, first off, in any service-based organisation &#8212; public or private &#8212; immediate (or at least near-immediate) response &#8212; even if it&#8217;s &#8220;we&#8217;ll get back to you&#8221; &#8212; is necessary to instill confidence. Lack of response breeds doubt, and especially with government, makes people think things are being done behind closed doors. In an era where we demand transparency, acknowledgement of a request is <em>the</em> killer app.<br />
It took a little while &#8212; still less time than it would have taken me, I&#8217;m sure &#8212; but I got my answer:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-Pleased-to-Report-....jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2911" title="Twitter _ John Mar_ @sowrey Pleased to Report, ..." src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-Pleased-to-Report-....jpg" alt="" width="613" height="303" /></a><br />
There you go &#8212; we were safe. And you feel a lot more secure with an answer from a public figure than you do from a city bureaucrat. But John&#8217;s answer got me to thinking: a) Iodine 131 is probably not regularly tested for in water supplies (why would it be?), and b) that&#8217;s a fairly recent test. Which led me to wonder if it might be an ongoing test for the foreseeable future:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-Geoff-Sowrey_-@aldjohnmar-That_s-a-relie-....jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2907" title="Twitter _ Geoff Sowrey_ @aldjohnmar That_s a relie ..." src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-Geoff-Sowrey_-@aldjohnmar-That_s-a-relie-....jpg" alt="" width="615" height="266" /></a><br />
John&#8217;s response, interestingly enough, I mostly expected:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-As-I-understand-it-....jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2908" title="Twitter _ John Mar_ @sowrey As I understand it ..." src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-As-I-understand-it-....jpg" alt="" width="611" height="266" /></a><br />
Now, it&#8217;s very easy to dismiss that as &#8220;well, that&#8217;s not answer&#8221; &#8230; and you&#8217;d be right, especially if you&#8217;re concerned about this sort of thing (which I am). But, where John does not fail, he followed up (unprompted) with this:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-Just-heard-back-fr-....jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2910" title="Twitter _ John Mar_ @sowrey Just heard back fr ..." src="http://www.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Twitter-_-John-Mar_-@sowrey-Just-heard-back-fr-....jpg" alt="" width="610" height="299" /></a><br />
So, net result, at least so far as Calgary&#8217;s water is concerned: we&#8217;re okay. But that&#8217;s actually the lesser part of the story. The more important, I think, is that I got an answer to a pressing question over Twitter (not waiting on phones), and directly from my elected official.<br />
As an interesting aside, <a href="http://twitter.com/aldjohnmar/status/11837858318913536">John actually left Twitter early last December</a>, after he received a fair amount of abuse from people who didn&#8217;t think he was tweeting enough. It was a loss for us who followed, since he had been a valuable source of information on the regular goings-on in city council.  Thankfully, John returned to Twitter about two months later.<br />
It&#8217;s a tough gig, being a public figure on Twitter. There are a lot of demands from the informed and uninformed alike, and people&#8217;s patience online is about a tenth of what it is in person (and politeness can sink to a hundredth or less). Somehow, people seem to forget that Twitter is an outlet, not a full-time job. John, so far, has done an admirable job of balancing the act, and remains (in my view) the best of Calgary&#8217;s city council in using Twitter is a communications tool.<br />
So go on, ask me if I feel my councillor is out of touch. I dare ya.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re barely a week into the 2011 Canadian Federal election, and it already feels like a month. I suppose if there&#8217;s one good thing about elections up here, it&#8217;s that they&#8217;re short &#8212; none of this near-two year campaigning that goes on south of the border.<br />
Already, the various political parties are &#8230; well, failing. I&#8217;m rather stunned how fast that happened, actually. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d actually try to get out a message first, but they stooped to mud-slinging pretty much out of the gate. Yeah, real positive way to foster respect and attract voters, folks&#8230;<br />
So I feel that, as a Canadian with some significant sense of civic duty (and certainly more than enough know-it-all-ism), I need to offer up some suggestions to our so-called &#8220;leaders&#8221; (read: I choose not to lay insults as they are neither interesting nor constructive) if they have any hope of inspiring Canadians to vote for them &#8230; <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2011/03/dear-canada-grow-a-backbone/">if at all</a>.<br />
<span id="more-2897"></span>Let&#8217;s start with the <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/">New Democratic Party</a>&#8230;<br />
So far, to be honest, I haven&#8217;t heard much out of you. Not here in the west, anyway. Yes, you need to acknowledge that we exist. Hate to break it to you, but if you have any hope of beating out either the Conservatives or the Liberals for a seat, you need to be <em>seen</em>. Guess whose ads I&#8217;ve yet to see plastered all over TV? I had to Google them, Jack. That required action: a <em>vested interest</em>. You want an audience? You&#8217;ll need to go <em>to</em> them. Maybe all the pick-up trucks scare you off? I don&#8217;t know. But I do know this: First basic rule of marketing &#8212; unless you&#8217;re highly visible, you won&#8217;t be remembered.<br />
Checking out your website is kind of informational, but you&#8217;re stooping to attacking your opponents right away. Your message? A little hard to see past the oh-so-thinly veiled attack on Ignatieff. (Look, if you want to question something he may or may not have done, get some facts. Nothing kills off a campaign run like a damn good scandal. A mere question will go unanswered, and will not sway <em>anyone</em>.)<br />
And the bit about more doctors and nurses? Hey, great, that&#8217;s awesome! What about the people who support the doctors and nurses? What about the hospitals for them to work in? And can you provide the details on how you&#8217;re going to prevent new grads from going elsewhere (like the States)? A few details will help prove that these are more than words. Remember, most Canadians will not shlep down to the local candidate to have a discussion. The internet will help, but only if your message is complete enough to convince someone beyond a simple belief.<br />
And for the love of pete, can someone in your IT group make sure that your website works for both &#8220;ndp.ca&#8221; and &#8220;www.ndp.ca&#8221;? That&#8217;s a pretty low bar, and you&#8217;re tripping over it&#8230;<br />
Next up, the <a href="http://www.liberal.ca/">Liberals</a>.<br />
Iggy, can you actually go a day without saying the word &#8220;Harper&#8221;?  I don&#8217;t think you can. I&#8217;m actually beginning to fear that you have no actual message at all, other than to oppose the Conservatives. I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=site%3Awww.liberal.ca+harper">on your website alone, there are over 6,400 mentions of &#8220;Harper&#8221;</a>! Exactly <em>whose</em> side are you on?<br />
You talk about Accountability on your website. How about some examples? Goodness knows that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harper">your BFF</a> has offered you countless examples upon which you can found your statements. But despite being the only party willing to post your policy points &#8212; you skimp over the details like a cheap restaurant that uses watered down tomato sauce and passes it off as pasta al fresco.<br />
Or how about your digital policy? You offer up a mere <em>three paragraphs</em>, and nothing else? Have you not paid a single shred of attention to all the C-32 and UBB nonsense? Might I remind the lauded Liberals that there are many Canadians who have a <strong>very vested interest</strong> in what plans you say you have, and would likely keenly vote if they made sense. <em>Cough, cough.</em> You might also want to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Hicock2010/cprs-part-2-nenshi-campaign">chat with Mr. Nenshi&#8230;</a><br />
Here&#8217;s a free I&#8217;ll throw you: &#8220;a Liberal government will not allow corporations and/or regulatory agencies to restrict Canadians access to critical resources through uninformed and/or falsified statements regarding resource use, either as a result of profit or security&#8221; as a broad statement, backed up by a list of proposed bills you intend to introduce to Parliament in your first 100 days. Just saying.<br />
Oh, and Iggy, if your party is going to hold up Laurier, Pearson, and Trudeau as the models for Liberal leadership, you might want to consider <em>finding your own identity</em> so we can pick you out of the noise.<br />
As for the <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/">Conservatives</a>&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.conservative.ca/multimedia/our_tv_ads/">your ads</a>. They&#8217;re wonderful, truly. They&#8217;re masterful of propagating the fear that right-leaning political groups love to instill in the populace. There&#8217;s nothing quite like creating an identity of evil for you to gain trust. (Hey, it worked in the church &#8212; nothing like the Devil to steer you straight, right?)<br />
Here&#8217;s a thought: you&#8217;ve gone two elections without winning a majority. (With me so far? Good.) See a problem? Here&#8217;s a hint: it&#8217;s not that you didn&#8217;t win a majority. Let me spell it out: your tactics haven&#8217;t changed &#8212; it&#8217;s still about fear. The way I see it, you&#8217;re not going to get much further, as you&#8217;ve scared all you can. It might have worked a couple of years ago when the economy was going through the grinder, but since we&#8217;re on the recovery and things are generally looking decent &#8230; well, you haven&#8217;t really got much, do you? Another problem: highly-educated people tend not to frighten easily. You want the rest of us to vote for you? You&#8217;d better come up with <strong>something more <em>intelligent</em></strong> than mere propaganda.<br />
Speaking of which, I went to your website to look for what you&#8217;re bringing to the table. The only thing under &#8220;Policy&#8221;? The 2011 Budget. That&#8217;s your policy? Nothing about Aboriginal rights? Nothing about the Environment? Not even Corporation support (which, we know, you do so very, very well)? You&#8217;re not really offering much, here. Your tax cuts aren&#8217;t offering much, either, since they don&#8217;t really fit the bill of Canadians&#8217; needs. Yes, we do need more doctors &#8230; but we don&#8217;t need billion-dollar warplanes. <em>Subtle hint.</em><br />
Yes, I know I&#8217;m missing out on the other parties out there: The Bloc Québécois (hint: give a crap about just one person not from Quebec), The Green Party (you need to distance yourself a bit more from the granola crowd), and a retinue of other parties &#8212; all of whom have a ways yet to go. All have a similar problem: appealing to the masses. Canadians, as a whole, are generally accepting, but historically-speaking, generally only vote for Conservative (right) or Liberal (centre). You don&#8217;t fit into those mentalities, you&#8217;re effectively fringe, at least at the federal level.<br />
So, to those who are leading the charge into our electoral fray, can we please dispense with the bull? Can we drop the mud, please, and actually have a real dialogue? It would be nice to know that there is more to our political system than mere bitching.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Canada, we&#8217;re in another pickle. The on-going &#8220;me, too!&#8221; power struggle that has dogged us for <strong>five years</strong> is now going into Round 3, thanks to a non-confidence (read: get enough people to whine the ruling party out of power) vote. In just over a month, we&#8217;re back at the polls, likely to do what we did last time, and the time before that: <strong>Make no decision whatsoever</strong>.<br />
I dunno what it is, but we Canadians seem to really love to not rock the boat. We don&#8217;t want heavy-handed politics, but we also want our cake and eat it, too. We want our health care, dammit, but <strong>we don&#8217;t want to pay for it</strong>. We want to leave our lights on 24/7, but please don&#8217;t raise our energy bills. And above all, we still want to be the &#8220;Nice&#8221; people in North America.<br />
Let&#8217;s face it, folks, <strong>we&#8217;re a bunch of pansies</strong>.<br />
<span id="more-2888"></span>Yes, you. I&#8217;m talking to you, Canada. Yes, you who <strong>hasn&#8217;t voted in several elections</strong>, you who doesn&#8217;t vote because you&#8217;re convinced <strong>your area only ever votes one way</strong>, even you who voted last time (and has done so since eligibility) because it was the right thing to do, but you <strong>didn&#8217;t actually spend any time</strong> to figure out who you should vote for &#8212; you just marked the person in your area whose sign you saw last.<br />
The last previous two elections have created, for all intents and purposes, <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)">a lame duck Parliament</a></strong>. Minority governments, at least in this country, are less effective than a eunuch in a Red Light district. Everything gets argued, <strong>nothing gets done</strong>. Meanwhile, budgets inflate, services break, money gets wasted, and the bitching about it all goes on unabated.<br />
What this country needs is a majority government. Yeah, they&#8217;re usually fraught with some sort of bullshit that&#8217;s common with power &#8212; some idiot who forgets that he&#8217;s <strong>there to service the people</strong> (not the other way around) and makes a few deals that sweetens his pocket. Next thing we know, we&#8217;ve got scandals, Royal Inquiries, and more than a few newspaper headlines about how so-and-so did such-and-such, and boy wasn&#8217;t that a bad thing. And no-one pays any attention to the dozens of other things that the same ruling party managed to accomplish, and suddenly <strong>Canada is itching for that next election</strong> to vote the offending party out so we can have something &#8220;better&#8221;.<br />
Well, &#8220;better&#8221; is our current problem. Right now, you&#8217;ve got (really) three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conservatives: Right wing, business-focused, tax-raising, and money-spending. They&#8217;ve been <strong>bought by American interests</strong> to push through horrible <a href="http://www.speakoutoncopyright.ca/">copyright policies that do not reflect Canadians</a>&#8216; interests, allowed Canadian companies to <a href="http://theubbdeception.ca/">push through billing practices that hurt the majority</a> of us, <a href="http://www.embassymag.ca/page/view/purchase-07-28-2010">want to buy warplanes</a> (and somehow, this is a good thing), and the <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/climate/canadas-lacklustre-environmental-record-causes-stir-20091130">environment is about as important as a rapidly-covered-up pimple</a>.</li>
<li>Liberals: Led by someone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ignatieff#Early_life_and_education">who should know better</a>, all the Liberals have managed to do for the last five years is (effectively) state how bad Stephen Harper is, how much better than Stephen Harper they are, boy isn&#8217;t Stephen Harper a bad example for Canada, <a href="http://www.calgarysun.com/news/Stampede/2010/07/10/14671501.html">Stephen Harper</a> <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/liberal-leader-ignatieff-harper-your-time">Stephen Harper</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=site%3Atwitter.com%2Fm_ignatieff+harper">Stephen Harper</a>. The <strong>Conservatives should really pay the Liberals for all the free advertising</strong> &#8212; it would only be fair. It would be far nicer if the Liberals stopped whining and actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_watch_me">sounded like Pierre Trudeau</a> again. Yeah, Trudeau might have been a pompous ass from time to time, but he still reigns as one of the best and most influential politicians from the last century.</li>
<li>NDP: I&#8217;d love for Jack Layton to be a stronger leader, I really would. I would also love the NDP to <strong>have a fiscal policy that had more of a balance</strong>; they lead almost as far to the left as the Conservatives do to the right. It would also be nice for them to recognise those of us who don&#8217;t have the luxury of working in a union, but are (generally) worked far harder that unions for far less payoff. Support the working person, and not just the few organised groups, and the rest of us would appreciate it immensely.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bloc? Quebec doesn&#8217;t have the population to win Federal control from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Canada">Rest of Canada</a>. (And if, by some freakish miracle, they did manage to get the minority control, you&#8217;d see a Coalition struck up that would make even the most jigsaw Frankenstein reel in sheer horror.) The Green Party is so much more left that the NDP look Liberal; Canada would need a serious slide back into socialism for Green to gain any significant footing.<br />
Guess what? <strong>We&#8217;re looking at another minority government.</strong> Because of what I said above, and you know it. There is no clear choice, and I don&#8217;t care who you are, where you live, or what you do. If you <strong>sit down and <em>truly think</em></strong> out the options (not just rote spit out your default answer), you would see that we&#8217;re basically screwed. You either choose a party who wants Canada to be America (for all intents and purposes), or you choose one of two groups who, frankly, <strong>have no message worth listening to</strong>.<br />
What this means &#8212; I hate to say it &#8212; that we&#8217;re going to vote for status quo. We&#8217;re not going to take a stand in our federal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system">parliamentary democracy</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> notwithstanding) and demand of our elected (or want-to-be-elected) representatives to <strong>stop acting like bickering children</strong>. We won&#8217;t take the responsibility to properly vet out the people we send to Ottawa, ask them the <em>hard questions</em> that prove they&#8217;re capable, and call them out when they do wrong. Because, in the end, <strong>we&#8217;re all spineless</strong> and just want things to be <strong>simple and easy</strong>. We want to have a few people make the real decisions, cast our vote in  acquiescence, and <strong>reserve our right to bitch</strong> about it afterwards.<br />
Want to rant back at me? Leave a nasty comment? <strong>Don&#8217;t waste my time</strong> &#8212; you want to prove me wrong, show up for your MP&#8217;s sessions (elected or nominated) and demand to know where they stand. Hell, record it so when they vote opposite of what you wanted, you can post it on YouTube for the world to see. <strong>I&#8217;m not your audience</strong> &#8212; you are. Your family &#8212; your children and theirs &#8212; depend on you making the right decision. (And no, I&#8217;m not going to tell you who to vote for &#8212; I may generally vote Liberal, but unless Iggy gets his head of out Harper&#8217;s ass, I&#8217;m not going to lining up for a red shirt this year.)<br />
This is going to be a bad election. I&#8217;m hoping &#8212; nay, <em>praying</em> &#8212; for a miracle that something truly significant happens. But I&#8217;m betting it won&#8217;t, and we&#8217;ll be right back where we&#8217;ve been, <strong>slowly rotting away under ineffective leadership</strong> from all sides, who want nothing more than to climb to the top of the dirt pile and claim that they&#8217;re the King of the Castle.<br />
Oh, Canada&#8230;</p>
