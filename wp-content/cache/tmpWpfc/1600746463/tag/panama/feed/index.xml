										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sitting near the edge of the illuminated blue-green pool, laptop burning a hole through my lap (as usual, the laptop is too wam to actually keep on a lap), spending some time outside while Mi Pequeña Niña is sleeping.  <br />
Yes, we leave her in a hotel room to sleep alone. It&#8217;s either that or we go to bed way too early, or we keep her up. Not much wiggle room, there.  <br />
Anyhoo, we&#8217;re sitting down by the pool to relax a bit before going to bed.  <br />
<span id="more-1123"></span>Our first day in Panama was much quieter than I&#8217;d expected. After breakfast, we wanted around the hotel a little bit before we all ended up in bed (MPN long before Alex and I). Arriving at the hotel at nearly 01:00 this morning and getting up at 8:00 after very little sleep (and a very long week) really takes its toll on you.  <br />
After that, it was off to Multiplaza Pacifica for a little shopping (we only ended up buying a book and a pair of water wings for MPN) and lunch. I had hoped we might be able to do Casco Viejo today, but time didn&#8217;t allow.<br />
Dinner was pretty much a let-down as well, as we couldn&#8217;t stay far due to the wee one&#8217;s need to eat. Combine that limitation with a loud, annoying live band, it made for a limiting day. Admittedly, not renting a car added to that, so we can&#8217;t really complain too much. In retrospect, we probably should have rented a car due to the lack of seatbelts in cars here &#8212; national law seems to only mandate them for the front seat. And without a car seat for El Bebe, we need to have them for us to hang onto her.  <br />
Not sure what we&#8217;re going to get up to tomorrow. Alex has hinted she&#8217;d like to see the Canal, but she also wants a pedicure. So we&#8217;ll see what happens.  <br />
Admittedly, I find this an interesting test for the work we&#8217;re doing with Panama Tourism, as this is exactly the situation we want to appeal to &#8212; people here on weekends. Now the question is: how to make it accessible?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve been around a bit. You&#8217;ve been to Costa Rica, Honduras, Belize, Hawaii. You&#8217;ve seen a lot, but are finding the same problem again and again and again &#8212; everyone else has already been there. They&#8217;ve done it, so every time you want to go somewhere, your friends are blasé about the whole thing.<br />
I&#8217;m gonna let you in on a little secret. There&#8217;s a small country near the equator that an exceedingly small number of people go to for tourism. Business, yes. One city as part of a cruise, maybe. But visit? Hardly.<br />
<span id="more-1016"></span>I&#8217;ll lay hard cash that when you hear &#8220;Panama&#8221;, you think &#8220;Canal&#8221;. It&#8217;s hard to get away from that. It&#8217;s the single most famous part of Panama, and their single largest source of income (between $150k and $200k for each ship, and over 13,000 ships pass through annually). It&#8217;s an association they will never be able to break, nor are they even interested in trying. It would be like trying to disassociate the Eiffel Tower from Paris.<br />
An interesting fact: only 20% of all visitors to Panama actually come as tourists. The rest are all business travellers, who spend almost no money outside of their activities. (And most of those travellers&#8217; expenses are paid for by their <em>Panamanian</em> companies, meaning no additional money comes into the country.) Very few people venture beyond Cuidad de PanamÃ¡ (Panama City) or ColÃ³n (the Caribbean end of the Panama Canal, which has a large free trade zone and is quite popular for shopping). The rest of the country goes ignored.<br />
Which is a shame, really. There are nine indigenous tribes still in Panama, who still live by their traditional ways. They&#8217;re all fully aware of the modern world outside, and most even have some form of homestay, hostel, or room you can stay at. The rainforest here has barely shrunk as no-one usually bothers to log a forest (there is a rainforest within minutes drive of Panama City). There are almost 1,000 bird species.<br />
And how can you resist a hotel that looks like this:<br />
<a href="http://www.puntacaracol.com/"><a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2008/07/where-you-should-go-on-your-next-vacation/punta-caracol/' title='Punta Caracol'><img width="300" height="225" src="https://new.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/Punta-Caracol-300x225.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignleft wp-image-3249" alt="Punta Caracol" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/alejandrotovar/2447863308/">Alex Tovar</a><br />
</a><br />
Guess how much a night? About $150/person (based on double occupancy). For a kick-ass cottage over the waters of the Caribbean. Can you go wrong?<br />
That&#8217;s the thing with Panama &#8212; it&#8217;s still cheap. Because so few people go there, it&#8217;s inexpensive. And it&#8217;s growing. Most of Panama is still pristine (eco-tourism is probably better &#8212; more &#8220;raw&#8221; &#8212; than even Costa Rica&#8217;s), and hotels are only now slowly being built.<br />
That&#8217;s part of the emphasis, too: &#8220;slowly&#8221;. Something we learned from talking with Rubén Blades (who is the Minister of Tourism) &#8212; Panama isn&#8217;t looking to grow overnight. They know what happened to Costa Rica. They don&#8217;t want such rapid growth that the infrastructure ends up being a disaster. Panama also knows that you can&#8217;t build with the expectation of people arriving all at once &#8212; you need slow, controlled growth.<br />
The growth is coming, but for now it&#8217;s all small numbers. Boutique-style hotels, hidden places that no-one&#8217;s seen probably for a thousand years. We joked that the only thing Panama doesn&#8217;t seem to have is a pyramid. (Sr. Blades joked that he tried to get one, but his counterpart in Belize said only if Panama would trade for the Canal.)<br />
And then there&#8217;s the shopping. One of the weird things of Panama is that it has excellent shopping. You can find deals virtually everywhere, and can get almost anything. For example, are you looking for a Rolex Daytona? You can get them here, easily. Even in stainless steel. Saw one myself. Five year waiting list? Not if you go here, first, my friend.<br />
We went to a mall that might as well have been from Las Vegas, for all the big name brands we saw. And I don&#8217;t mean box stores &#8212; there are no Wal-Marts, Costcos, or Home Depots here. I mean Armani, Cartier, FCUK, and Lacoste (which seems really popular here) to name but a few. And if you take the train out to ColÃ³n (a route I recommend only because the view is (probably) spectacular, and you don&#8217;t have to drive yourself), you can go to the largest free trade zone after Hong Kong. I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s a shopper&#8217;s heaven.<br />
Want to find a super-cool place to live in an old part of an old city, but can&#8217;t seem to afford the rates in other places? Check out the Old Quarter of Panama. It&#8217;s screaming for gentrification. It&#8217;s started already, but the prices are still very low compared to other similar places in the world, and you just can&#8217;t beat that Spanish Colonial style. Besides, you&#8217;ll not only Sr. Blades as a neighbour, but also the President of Panama.<br />
There is no doubt in my mind that I&#8217;m going back. I want to see more of Panama. Not Panama City, but the rest of the country. And I&#8217;m staying at a hotel on the water.<br />
Depends who gets there first. You, or the rest of the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m in Panama. Been here since Tuesday afternoon. Been really, really busy. So far, the biggest problem I&#8217;ve had here (aside from the aforementioned busy-ness and subsequent inability to talk to my family), is that I&#8217;ve had Van Halen&#8217;s <em>Panama</em> stuck in my head pretty much since we left San Jose.<br />
Damn you, David Lee Roth. Damn you!<br />
So far, it&#8217;s a great place to visit (a post coming on this soon). But we&#8217;ve been steadily on the move.<br />
Oy.<br />
<span id="more-1012"></span> Lemme recap the last couple of days as best I can.<br />
Tuesday:<br />
8:00 leave apartment, catch taxi to airport.<br />
8:30(ish) arrive at airport<br />
9:05 finally get through check-in<br />
9:15 through security<br />
10:05 board the plane<br />
10:55 finally depart for Panama<br />
13:15 touchdown in Panama (+1 hour time change)<br />
14:45 arrive at hotel<br />
13:15 Javier takes Mark, Jason, and I for a &#8220;little walk&#8221; in the area around the hotel. Javier&#8217;s a shopper. Hits about every second store along the Via España.<br />
16:30 Gabriel (our contact here) picks us up at an Indian shop near the hotel and takes us to the Old Quarter for a tour<br />
16:30 &#8211; 20:30 &#8220;tour&#8221; of the Old Quarter and Miraflores lock of Panama canal. Gabriel (who lives here) gets lost (I think).<br />
20:30 &#8211; 23:00 dinner<br />
23:30 finally get into my room (didn&#8217;t actually get the key until then). Pass out.<br />

Wednesday<br />
6:15 up and out to the gym for a workout<br />
7:15 in room and showering.<br />
8:00 breakfast with the team + Dave (who arrived the evening before). Strategy discussion over huevos reveltos.<br />
8:45 &#8211; 18:00 meetings in various places. Convinced I&#8217;m going to get a freaking disease from the DEEP FREEZE Panamanians seem to maintain their air conditioning at. Freaking INSANELY cold. We go outside into the oppressive heat and humidity because it&#8217;s more comfortable.<br />
18:00 &#8211; 19:00 try to answer emails. Emphasis on &#8220;try&#8221;. Internet works, but unable to connect to much. Not sure why. Highly annoying.<br />
19:00 &#8211; 20:00 waiting in the lobby for people to appear. Total lack of communication and no-one knows where everyone else is. Namely Dave, who decides that running in a strange, possibly dangerous city (after dark) is a good idea.<br />
20:00 &#8211; 21:30 Gabriel picks us up again in his Yaris. Yes, Yaris. <em>Four</em> large white men and two not-so-small Ticans. In a YARIS. Jason (probably the tallest of the bunch) and I literally share the front seat, him resting his ass half on the console, the other half on me, and hoping to sweet mercy that the gear shift don&#8217;t end up where the sun don&#8217;t shine. We get lost. Twice. In 10 minutes. In some very sketchy parts of town.<br />
21:30 &#8211; 23:30 finally get to the restaurant (on a peninsula out in the ocean, no less). Panamanians eat late, it seems. Dinner. Chat. Try to not fall asleep in my fish.<br />
00:00 get back to my room. Catch up on a day&#8217;s worth of email. Pass out.<br />
Today<br />
6:15 alarm goes off.<br />
6:25 alarm goes off.<br />
6:35 alarm goes off. Finally drag my arse out of bed. Go have shower.<br />
7:10 breakfast with the team.<br />
7:45 leave for the client&#8217;s office.<br />
8:00 &#8211; 15:30 meetings. Long, tiring day.<br />
15:30 &#8211; 16:00 got to meet Ruben Blades, internationally-renowned singer and actor, who is also the Minister of Tourism. Very freaking cool guy. No, I don&#8217;t have a picture because it&#8217;s highly inappropriate to POIDH while in a business meeting.<br />
16:30 leave the client office for the hotel<br />
17:00 as a result of things from the meetings, we decide to grab a cab and &#8220;drive around&#8221; a bit to get a better feel for Panama. End up in the Old Quarter (again), but get a bit of a guided tour, which is cool.<br />
19:30 dinner. Earliest one yet. Good, but picked a WAY too pricey restaurant. Cheap by our standards, but three times the price of other places we&#8217;ve been.<br />
21:34 I get to post this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might be wondering: Gee, Geoff, where are all the posts you had for Costa Rica? Well, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want them up, it&#8217;s an issue of timing. I can&#8217;t really go into that right now, but let&#8217;s just say that this is the best way to have it for now.<br />
But on the bright side, there is more stuff to come shortly. Our month o&#8217; meetings continues as we head down to Panama [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5g2yyvdjrE">insert Van Halen here</a>] tomorrow for a client kick-off. This should be fun.<br />
First, though, let me recap our weekend just past.<br />
<span id="more-1011"></span>Friday night was another exploration for us. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out what all the local spots are, which ones are good and which ones we can skip. (Thursday night, after a meeting with Mama Luz &#8212; our realtor who has helped us so much in finding places to live &#8212; we&#8217;d found a place called &#8220;Bar Amigo&#8221;, which turned out to be a gringo place. It was okay &#8212; great hot dogs &#8212; but a place to visit rarely.) Across the road from Yakky&#8217;s was another restaurant/bar (they&#8217;re all restaurant/bars here) where we had a couple of drinks.<br />
[flickr]photo:2616702562(small)[/flickr]<br />
Realising that wasn&#8217;t the place we wanted to be, we shuffled out and drove back into downtown Santa Ana (which doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;downtown&#8221; area, but it&#8217;s what most Westerners would associate with) to find a new place. The name I totally forget &#8212; yet we went back there on Sunday for the EuroCup final. It was more of a Tican place &#8212; menus in Spanish, and typÃƒ ­co food played heavily.<br />
I love Costa Rica for the seafood. I have not had such good seafood in a very long time. And it&#8217;s really inexpensive. (You can pay Western prices for seafood quite easily here, I should add. One of the reasons we&#8217;re looking around is to find where the locals eat, which is generally cheap and always tasty.) We even racked up a couple of pool games on tables that looked like they&#8217;d just been unwrapped.<br />
That&#8217;s when we met the owner, who&#8217;s name also escapes me. A tall, thin white guy from Vancouver, who felt that his life&#8217;s ambition was to open a bar. A business guy, no doubt by his demeanour, who really just wanted something simple to do with life. I&#8217;m really beginning to see the appeal.<br />
Mark and Jason decided that they just had to go clubbing. But I&#8217;m not the clubbing type. Never have been, and thankfully never will be. By that point, I was the sober one, so drove them to a club next to our temporary office space, and headed home.<br />
What happened to Mark and Jason, you ask? Well, I can&#8217;t speak for them. But let&#8217;s say that when I saw them the next morning, Mark had a big cup of coffee already in his hand, and the first word out of Jason&#8217;s mouth was: &#8220;COFFEE&#8221;.<br />
After a small desayuno at a small café in Escazu, we all headed into San José for something we wanted to do: check out the Central Market.<br />
The trip in wasn&#8217;t so bad. Thankfully due to two other runs into San José for meetings, we had a vague idea of where we were going. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find our way to the Central area. But we weren&#8217;t in any hurry, so Jason took us on a bit of a detour around the Central area before coming back in to find a place to park. Easier said than done, let me tell you. But we actually managed to find a place right behind the Teatro Nacional (National Theatre).<br />
[flickr]photo:2621711390(small)[/flickr]<br />
We wandered around the Square a bit before walking up and down Avenue Central, which is largely a pedestrian mall in the centre of the city. On Saturday, the place is packed. Not quite wall-to-wall people but it was certainly more people than I remembered from January 2005, when Alex and I did the same walk. Line ups were everywhere. We&#8217;d seen a huge one at the hospital just west of the Central area, and every single ATH (the Spanish acronym for ATM) had at least 15 people waiting. The money changing lines were even bigger. Apparently, this was the big day to go out.<br />
Reaching the eastern end of the pedestrian area, we double-backed and headed west. Mercado Central (the Central Market) was at the other end. Everywhere we walked, the street was dotted with cows. Not real cows, but statues of cows. Sculptures, really. Calgary had done the same thing about 5-6 years ago. The cows here are more plentiful in number (the Multiplaza in Escazu has at least a dozen of them) and far more decorated. Some are just downright hilarious.<br />

Lots of people selling all sorts of things. While Mark might be able to pass for a Tico (if he didn&#8217;t dress so snazzy), Jason (being tall and blonde) and I (being dorky and not at all Tican) stick out quite easily. That means everyone running up to us offering &#8220;Ray Ban&#8221; sunglasses and &#8220;Rolex&#8221; watches. I was sooooo tempted to look at the Rolexes just to see what they looked like. But somehow, I managed to refrain. Next time, I&#8217;m giving these guys the gears. Fakes aren&#8217;t as easy to come across in Costa Rica as I&#8217;d thought, but it&#8217;s far from hidden.<br />
At the other end of the mall, we found the Mercado Central. Somehow, Alex and I had missed this when we were there. It&#8217;s an entire block of twisting hallways barely wide enough for a person to walk through with all the stores&#8217; wares bulging beyond their walls. It&#8217;s dark, it&#8217;s crowded, your senses are assaulted by unknown sounds and smells, and in some areas you&#8217;re straining to see through the dark. In short, it&#8217;s <em>awesome</em>.<br />

We stumbled up to a little coffee shop in the north-east corner. Hopping up on three stools, we stared as the coffee roasted in an oven, pouring into a massive cooling bin. The smell of roasting coffee wafted about, overpowering the fish stalls about 20 feet away. Mark and Jason were in need of coffee. I still don&#8217;t drink it (I promise to document the event when it does happen), so endulged in a hot chocolate. Mark and Jason swear that it&#8217;s the best coffee that they&#8217;ve had &#8230; outside of Italy.<br />

(Mark has a pretty good theory: the Italians haven&#8217;t invented a lot of foods. They imported coffee, tomatoes, pasta, and rice from other cultures. But they perfected them. There&#8217;s a reason why Italians are noted for those things, because they got them exactly right.)<br />
The rest of the market unveiled treasures the likes of which are hard to imagine. This is not a tourist market. This is a working market. Yes, there are a crapload of tourists here, and there are a number of stalls that cater only to tourists. But go in deeply enough, and there are foods you don&#8217;t recognise, smells you can&#8217;t identify, and more than a few sounds that would be foreign in almost any market in Canada or the United States.<br />

Finding our rented car still intact, we headed back out of the city and over to Cariari to find a music store for Mark (he wants a guitar). Turns out the Cariari Mall is quite the dive. We didn&#8217;t stay long, desiring to go to Escazu instead. Stepping outside, a good clap of thunder told us the sunny part of the day was officially over. By the time we got to the Multiplaza, we were in the midst of the heaviest rain we&#8217;ve seen since arriving. Outside for maybe 10 seconds (between the car and the mall entrance), we got a good soaking. The rain lasted over an hour and half.<br />

Saturday night was a quiet one. I ate at home, though we all went out in search of something to do beyond bars. A bowling alley, or something. Movies here are limited, and <em>Wall-E</em> isn&#8217;t out yet. We ended up at Yakky&#8217;s again. Mark and Jason ate. I talked.<br />
On Sunday, Mark and I went into the office to access the internet. I feel bad about thieving internet at the apartment, and the signal hasn&#8217;t been reliable the previous few days. When all you have is a small blurry video and scratchy audio to see your wife and child, you&#8217;re willing to spend time in an office to see them. Sadly, they were out.<br />
Just before 13:00, we were back at the bar we&#8217;d found on Friday night, seated at a table in clear view of a big screen TV, watching the live broadcast of the Spain vs. Germany final game of the EuroCup 2008 series. I honestly expected more people to be in the bar, but I could also hear people in their homes not far away, too. Football here is popular (not American Football, which is what Canada and United States prefer to watch), and I&#8217;d heard &#8220;second only to religion&#8221;. Admittedly, I&#8217;m not sure how true that is.<br />

It was a great game, though. Well-played, even if it there was only one goal.<br />
It started to rain as we drove home after a quick stop at the Auto Mercado for some things around the house. And it rained for the next 4-5 hours &#8212; a rarity here. Rain usually lasts at most an hour. But it did make for a nice cool night.<br />
