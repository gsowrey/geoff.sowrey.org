								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Julia is getting ready to have her Canadian Citizenship test, as she&#8217;s tired of being merely a Permanent Resident, and now apparently wants to have more say in these taxes she&#8217;s been paying.<br />
To that end, she&#8217;s received and is now reviewing the requisite materials for the test. (I offer you <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AdMNaHmNLgy9ZGRwYnBocTNfMzBjN3pmdmJjYw&amp;hl=en">the list of questions she gave to me</a>, unaltered, as a starting point.) As one might expect, the test has a number of questions that, yes, an average born-and-raised-in-Canada Canadian would flunk. (I would imagine the same is true of most countries.) Some of these are taken for granted, as just about everyone just accepts things as they are.<br />
But some of these questions are &#8230; well, let&#8217;s say that they just scream for alternative answers.<br />
<span id="more-1471"></span>I&#8217;m not going to put up every question because some of them are just darn obvious. Or otherwise boring, and have no particularly interesting answers. Again, if you want to see the original list, follow the above link. As for the answers, well, this is my take on them. So if you&#8217;re actually studying for the Canadian citizenship test, please, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">for the love of the maple leaf, read Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are the Aboriginal peoples of Canada?<br />
Joe, Marge, Fred, Little Tom, Kinney, and Wilma.</li>
<li>Why are the Aboriginal peoples of Canada working toward self-government?<br />
If you&#8217;ve got the opportunity to not have to deal with the federal government, wouldn&#8217;t you?</li>
<li>Where did the first European settlers in Canada come from?<br />
Um&#8230; Europe?</li>
<li>Why did the early explorers first come to Atlantic Canada?<br />
Well, it was pretty bloody hard to go to Pacific Canada,   wasn&#8217;t it?</li>
<li>What three industries helped the early settlers build communities in the Atlantic region?<br />
Wal-Mart, McDonald&#8217;s, and Tim Horton&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Who were the United Empire Loyalists?<br />
A British football team.</li>
<li>What form of transportation did Aboriginal peoples and fur traders use to create trading networks in North America?<br />
<a href="http://www.ski-doo.com/">The ski-doo.</a></li>
<li>What important trade did the Hudsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Bay Company control?<br />
Hockey cards.</li>
<li>What did the government do to make immigration to western Canada much easier?<br />
Made living in eastern Canada so unbearable that everyone fled west.</li>
<li>What is the Canadian Constitution?<br />
A piece of paper.</li>
<li>Which was the last province to join Canada?<br />
Newfoundland. (And while this is the truthful answer, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.newfiejokes.net/">newfie joke</a> all onto its own.)</li>
<li>Name two fundamental freedoms protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<br />
The right to bitch about the government and the right to apologise to anyone for no particular reason.</li>
<li>List three ways in which you can protect the environment.<br />
Again, a bit of a serious response &#8212; &#8216;cuz, yes, this is an actual question. I think it&#8217;s actually a survey question, because the federal government in Canada clearly doesn&#8217;t know how to do this themselves.</li>
<li>What are the two official languages of Canada?<br />
English, and French spoken really poorly by English-speakers.</li>
<li>What does the Canadian flag look like?<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=canadian+flag+joke">Must. Hold. Back. Obvious. Joke.</a></li>
<li>What song is Canadaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s national anthem?<br />
Duh! The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByKu8BwT5K4">theme to Hockey Night In Canada</a>!</li>
<li>Which animal is an official symbol of Canada?<br />
Okay, another serious one. The beaver. Seriously. How can you not love a country where it&#8217;s national symbol is the <em>beaver</em>. Ahem.</li>
<li>Where are the Great Lakes?<br />
Probably where you last left them.</li>
<li>Which country borders Canada on the south?<br />
Um. China? (Is this to trip up Americans applying for citizenship?)</li>
<li>What are the three main types of industries in Canada?<br />
Beer, hockey, and donuts.</li>
<li>In what industry do most Canadians work?<br />
Based on the NHL players, it&#8217;s definitely ice-related.</li>
<li>What is Canadaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s system of government called?<br />
According to my dad, it&#8217;s &#8220;A Fucking Mess&#8221;.</li>
<li>What are the three parts of Parliament?<br />
&#8220;Goofy&#8221;, &#8220;Dopey&#8221;, and &#8220;Sleepy&#8221; come to mind&#8230; (On a serious note: Hey Canucks, did you know there were <em>three</em>?)</li>
<li>Explain how the levels of government are different.<br />
Well, all they tend not to do much. After that, it&#8217;s kinda dicey&#8230;</li>
<li>What do you call a law before it is passed?<br />
A joke.</li>
<li>How are members of Parliament chosen?<br />
Usually it&#8217;s the only person left after everyone else says: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna do it!&#8221;</li>
<li>Who do members of Parliament represent?<br />
Cynical answer: Themselves.</li>
<li>What is the government of all of Canada called?<br />
See #22.</li>
<li>How many electoral districts are there in Canada?<br />
Again, kinda serious&#8230; Are you fucking kidding me? Even the CBC doesn&#8217;t know this and has to look it up. I just laughed when I first heard this. Seriously? You want me to know this?</li>
<li>What three requirements must you meet in order to vote in a federal election?<br />
a) Be alive, b) not be totally drunk, and c) be ready to start bitching about the changes</li>
<li>What is written on a federal election ballot?<br />
Kinda like the electoral districts question, I was surprised by this one. I honestly have no idea, beyond the list of names of the people I&#8217;m supposed to choose from. Which, when you think about it, ain&#8217;t a lot of information to go on.<br />
Man, elections are kinda dumb.</li>
<li>What do political parties do?<br />
Again, I think this is a survey, because the government must be looking for suggestions on this one.</li>
<li>Which federal political party is in power?<br />
Funny, but somewhat true &#8212; right now, none. Minority governments mean no power. All of it is pure bargaining.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, those are my (somewhat) interesting responses. I know there are lots more, though. Anyone else care to add a few?</p>

Well, thanks to the residents of Calgary Centre-North, Canada is now stuck with Jim Prentice <em>again</em>.  And I&#8217;m just too darned tired to rant. Wasted effort at this point.  <br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn&#8217;t a predictive headline, folks. This is truth. The Conservatives will win the election in October. I, as an Expat, can&#8217;t vote in it, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t take at least a sense of interest in it. Or stock in the fact that the Conservatives are finally getting what they wanted the last time: Complete control.<br />
For the last two years, Canada has been living in the most blessed of political states: a minority government. As close to having the car in neutral as it gets. It means the least chance of political scandal (the &#8220;ruling&#8221; party doesn&#8217;t want to make mistakes that&#8217;ll haunt them come election time), and the opposition enjoys a place of perceived power as they get courted by the ruling party to help push through votes.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s all coming to an end now. So brace yourself, Canada &#8212; things are likely to get worse.<br />
<span id="more-1086"></span>Here&#8217;s the reality: The Conservatives are keen on setting the dial back a number of years. Estimates vary between 5 and 50. They want a world that&#8217;s white-bread, heterosexual, and very business-friendly. As opposed to being morally and ethically stalwart.<br />
Now, for the record, I&#8217;m not holding up the Liberals to that standard. As we all know, their 13-year run in office went seriously afoul and rotten towards the end. Not a problem with the Liberals per se, but with a lack of government controls. Things like that make it hard to keep office.<br />
Unlike the Liberals, the Conservatives are also very straight-forward with what they want. They will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn a blind eye to the environment, crying an attack on the economy every time</li>
<li>Repeal the same-sex laws</li>
<li>Keep the GST artifically low to make good with the Canadian public, despite a perpetual deficit</li>
<li>Raise an issue with Canadian sovernity over the arctic waters</li>
<li>Claim the Liberals are liars</li>
</ul>
<p>My arguments to these?</p>
<ul>
<li>You can focus on the economy now, or deal with the disaster later when the environment is in serious trouble. We know global warming has started to thaw the arctic, has accelerated the melting of glaciers (and will turn parts of Alberta to desert within 30 years), the abysmal record of the oil sands is ruining massive tracts of northern wilderness, the rise of temperatures is causing more and more issues with farming, and a never-ending dependence on gasoline is ruining air quality across the country. So what&#8217;ll it be, Harper &#8212; deal with the problem while it&#8217;s still manageable, or worry about your next meal ticket.</li>
<li>I hate to say it, but this is coming. There are too many intolerant people in the Conservative party, and I full expect them to dig this corpse out and force a repeal.</li>
<li>News flash, folks &#8212; you might be paying less GST, but you&#8217;re suffering for it when you go to the doctor or have to pay more for your childrens&#8217; education. Where do you think this money was coming from before? Yep, taxes. It&#8217;s a bit of a &#8220;duh&#8221;, but I&#8217;m regularly amazed at how many people complain about both high taxes and difficult medical care. I suggest picking one and sticking with it.</li>
<li>Canada has a place in the arctic &#8212; defending the rights of those who live there, and protecting the delicate environment that&#8217;s rapidly falling apart. And that should be it. This isn&#8217;t the Panama Canal, folks; even thinking of charging a toll for passage is just asking for conflict.</li>
<li>Everyone lies in politics. The trick is identifying it. That&#8217;s your reponsibility as a Canadian citizen, I might add &#8212; not theirs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s my problem with this election: There are no alternatives. Dion is totally the wrong person for the job. He has even less charisma than Harper (yes, it is possible). The Liberal Party chose wrong. They went with a Francophone in the interests of preserving national unity. But a Francophone does not represent the new powerhouse of the West (Alberta outclocks Ontario, folks, by quite a large margin when you look at the per capita). Canadians like money, and Harper comes from a province with stinkloads of it.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t matter what the Liberals should have done &#8212; that&#8217;s old news, now. It&#8217;s how they&#8217;re going to handle this election. The Liberals are going to take a serious hit. The Conservatives have done an excellent job of not pissing anyone off, and have a track record to be envious of. The Liberals? Whine, whine whine. Not smart.<br />
NDP? Please. Don&#8217;t make me laugh. The Bloc also serves no threat &#8230; except to the Liberals. See above.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/06/04/tech-prentice.html">&#8220;Honourable&#8221;</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Prentice">Jim Prentice</a>,<br />
Allow me to express my sincerest feelings when I say you are responsible for <em>fucking</em> over the Canadian people. <a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=3570473&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=E">This bill you are introducing this morning</a> &#8212; likely as I write this very post &#8212; is not for the benefit of the Canadian people.<br />
Not one bit.<br />
<span id="more-1000"></span>This is purely to support two things: <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/12/18/mtv-declares-music-i.html">Archaic business models that have not yet woken up to the new economy</a>, and to the United States government. You are blatantly ignoring the wishes of the informed Canadian public, who (thanks to the <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/">grassroots efforts of Michael Geist</a>) have told you that this is a bad idea. You mistakenly believe that it is business that runs this country, and not its citizens.<br />
You claim you wish to find balance between the Canadian people and business. Unless there are 10+ million business involved, Mr. Prentice, I&#8217;m rather certain there will be no balance even considered. And when the courts become clogged with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=riaa+lawsuits">incessant and insipid lawsuits</a> rivalling the ridiculousness going on with the RIAA south of the border, we&#8217;ll know who to thank.<br />
Be rest assured, there are a lot of people in your constituency who are not happy with you. I hope this is your last hurrah in Ottawa, because I&#8217;d be very surprised if you are re-elected after this. You are effectively handcuffing our daily activities for no valid reason. Please explain to me why I am not allowed to put movies I have purchased on my iPod or put them onto my home media server? You can&#8217;t.<br />
There is no valid reason &#8230; except money of course. I dare not suggest anything further on this matter, since I&#8217;m sure it would raise some interesting legal issues. But I truly do wonder what is going through that pin head of yours that thinks this is good for the Canadian people.<br />
And please, let&#8217;s remember that this is about people, not companies nor governments. Laws are meant to support day-to-day civil operation of a society, not hamstring it to the point of revolution. Canada stands (as much as it can, knowing full well yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/11/apology-future.html">long-overdue apology for residential schooling</a>) for tolerance, understanding, and balance. Let&#8217;s not make another dumb-ass mistake that lingers for a century. The Digital Copyright Millennium Act made one major fallacy &#8212; it assumed that it understood the new economy. It clearly hasn&#8217;t. Nor do you. As the Minister of Industry, you might want to brush up on that.<br />
Shit like this makes me almost happy to be moving to Costa Rica&#8230;<br />
[Update]<br />
I also have to add a link to an excellent article by fellow Twitterite Matthew Ingram, who <a href="http://www.mathewingram.com/work/2008/06/12/canadian-copyright-bill-good-and-bad/">really nailed some of the key issues with this bill</a>.<br />
[Update Update]<br />
I changed a couple of notes above once I had a chance to read some of <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3025/125/">Michael Geist&#8217;s review of the new act</a>. Overall, I still hold the same level of seething hate for this act (I still think we&#8217;re getting royally screwed by big business and American interests), I just wanted to make sure I wasn&#8217;t using a fact incorrectly. (Notably, I can copy music to my iPod, but I can&#8217;t copy a movie that I purchased to my home media server.)</p>

So the other day, I heard a comment that the Loonie was the highest it&#8217;s been since the early 1970s. About the time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Tricky Dicky</a> was in the Oval Office.<br />
That made me wonder a little&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-847"></span>Thanks to the internet, there&#8217;s a lot of information that&#8217;s now readily available. Like historical data on the Canadian dollar vs. the American dollar. And finding dates of offices for seated US Presidents isn&#8217;t exactly something that requires a PhD.<br />
So, using a graph acquired from the <a href="http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/">Pacific Exchange Rate Service</a> and dates from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> itself, I&#8217;ve come up with this:<br />

So I ask you, because I&#8217;m a little hesitant to read into this too deeply, does having a perceived ill-performing President directly lead to a low US dollar? We all know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon">Nixon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford">Ford</a> didn&#8217;t really do much, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter">Carter</a> didn&#8217;t rock the boat (he is a peaceful person), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan">Reagan</a> brought about &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics">Reaganomics</a>&#8221; which then led to controversy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush">G. H. W. Bush</a> brought about the first Iraq War, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton">Clinton</a>&#8216;s biggest problem was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal">his libido</a>, and I&#8217;m curious to see how history writes up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush">Dubya</a>.<br />
Things that make you go &#8220;hmm&#8221;&#8230;</p>
