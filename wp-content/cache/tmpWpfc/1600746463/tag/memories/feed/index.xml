								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still remember the day. December 6, 1995. I had been working at my part-time job at a computer store just off-campus, suffering through a wicked head cold. I&#8217;d begged my manager to let me leave early, but he&#8217;d needed me to stay. (I remember feeling not only put out, but tortured &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t done much all day.) I had trudged the two-odd kilometres back home just itching to crawl into bed and not emerge for a day or so. But when I placed my foot on the driveway of the house I was living in, I had a feeling that something wasn&#8217;t right.<br />
I rushed inside, quickly descending to the room in the basement I&#8217;d rented (I was one of seven students in the house; four up, three down), and immediately went over to my phone, not removing my jacket. There was the familiar pulsing tone that said I had voicemail. It was my father. Dad never called me.   Mom would always call, then hand over to Dad. He was quiet, saying only to call home when I got in. The news was short.<br />
Grandma had died.<br />
<span id="more-2570"></span>My grandmother &#8212; my Dad&#8217;s mom &#8212; had not been well. She was in her late 80s (I think she was 87 at the time of her death), and like many people her age, some of the senses had waned over the years. Her vision had been a problem for a few years previous, such that she no longer drove and required a large magnifying glass to read. Unknownst to us, until my Aunt Ruth happened to find out by accident, Grandma&#8217;s sense of smell had also gone. Sour milk and a too-far-gone chicken breast were the last straw, and with much cajoling, Grandma finally had to give up her home of 60 years. It was hard on everyone.<br />
Grandma moved into a retirement  condominium in Oakville, about a 10 minute drive from our home. It was a nice place, and we tried to visit as often as we could. It was there I saw my Grandma on a warm September day, on my way up to Waterloo for my fall semester. It was my second semester in a row, having decided to do a full year at school to make up time for my discipline change, and subsequent delay in graduation.<br />
I stayed about long enough to have a quick lunch with her, chat a bit, before I had to hit the road. I can&#8217;t remember what haste I was in to get back to Waterloo, and I&#8217;m sure now that I wasn&#8217;t as important as it was to have stayed longer. In hindsight, as is often the case with things or people that go away or are lost, you wish you&#8217;d spent more time.  As I left, she handed me a can of pop, for the road, so I wouldn&#8217;t get thirsty. Little did I know that when I left, it would be the last time I would ever see her.<br />
[flickr]photo:4314664943(small)[/flickr]<br />
For some reason, I never got around to drinking the pop, a can of Our Compliments ginger ale. In fact, it inexplicably ended up sitting in my room, unopened, for months. Then word came that Grandma had an accident. She&#8217;d fallen, and broken her hip. She was moved to the hospital in Oakville, where she would remain under watch for weeks. Her condition never really improved, and she slowly slipped away. Among the regrets of my life is not having gone to see her. I&#8217;m sure I had excellent excuses, all of which now amount to nothing.<br />
I don&#8217;t remember if I cried. If I did, there&#8217;s no way to know if it was at all influenced by my own illness. (I don&#8217;t even remember the continuation of the illness after my phone call with Dad.) But I was saddened by her passing. She had been a part of my life for as long as I could remember. She had baked amazing Christmas cookies. We&#8217;d always gone to Grandma&#8217;s house for New Year&#8217;s dinner. She drank sherry, and ate those sugary fruit gels from Laura Secord. We&#8217;d play with my Dad&#8217;s old Dinky cars on her ornate rug, looking at a painting of two sailing ships over her fireplace.  The painting, incidentally, now resides in my basement.<br />
I didn&#8217;t go to my Grandma&#8217;s funeral. It was a hard decision for me to make. I had a project due the day after the funeral, and two classmates, Kim and Amber-Lynn, depending on me to help deliver it. I wore a black band on my arm (made of two black socks I tied together &#8212; it was all I had) all day.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t open the can.<br />
The can stayed unopened for over 14 years. It moved from Waterloo, to Oakville, to Vancouver, to Calgary. I displayed it prominently on shelves in my apartments. People would look at it, and wonder why it was on a shelf. But no-one ever tried to open it. Very few people even asked. (I suspect most of them thought I was just a slob.) But it was there, my memory in clear view. It stayed in storage for the year and a half we were in Costa Rica, and probably even longer prior to us moving (I&#8217;m not exactly sure when it went into storage, to be honest).<br />
While unpacking our stuff over the last month and a half, I pulled it out and dusted it off. It felt only about half-full. But there were no holes, no leaks that I could see. So far as I could tell, the liquid inside had evaporated out. (I presume that&#8217;s possible?) Beside the can were piles of things to be donated, recycled, or outright thrown away. Things that had long pre-dated the can, and things that had carried a lot of sentimentality. I thought about the can&#8217;s prominence, what the can meant, and even the potential dangers it now presented to my family. I came to one conclusion:<br />
It was time for the can to go.<br />
One last picture. A pause, then I cracked it open (no fizz left), and emptied the contents. (Sorry, Grandma, but after over 14 years, I&#8217;m sure the contents would border on being unsafe for human consumption.) Then I took a last look, and recycled the can.<br />
In the end, it&#8217;s not the can that mattered. It was who it represented. The physical manifestation of a memory doesn&#8217;t make the memory any stronger, or any more pertinent in my life. If nothing else, this entry helps me appreciate what she did for me, for my family. Her values, her sense of adventure, her stubbornness have all played significantly in my foundation, either directly from her or handed down through the family line.<br />
So if you&#8217;re reading, Grandma, thank you. Thank you for the things you&#8217;ve done, and the things you&#8217;re yet to do. You&#8217;ve got some great-grandchildren who&#8217;ve yet to hear your tales, and will smile widely at the stories I have to tell.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you read that right. I drank coffee. Not a coffee-flavoured beverage, not something with Kahlua. Coffee. Real. Honest. Caffeinated.<br />
Those of you who know me are probably all thinking the same thing: Uh oh.<br />
I offer you the following piece of encouragement: Don&#8217;t panic. I&#8217;m not an addict. Yet.<br />
<span id="more-1158"></span>So why now? Well, it was partly a snap decision, though there was a wee bit of premeditation to it. Mark had suggested that we take a trip out to the <a href="http://www.orosivalley.com/">Orosi Valley</a>, a region about 30 kilometres east of San Jose. The valley is one of the major coffee-producing areas of Costa Rica, which is evident mere moments after entering the area &#8212; you can&#8217;t miss the rows of coffee plants.<br />
I opted to make this a &#8220;surprise&#8221; journey, and didn&#8217;t really tell Alex where we were going. As usual, this led to an endless string of placenames as Alex tried (unsuccessfully) to guess. This time, I figured I had her, since the route was convoluted enough that should wouldn&#8217;t be able to easily stumble across it. (On <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/09/17/weekend-at-tabacon/">our previous journey</a>, she knew we were going to Arenal within minutes of us leaving National Route 1.)<br />
Thanks to Hermes, we now had a faster way of getting around San Jose (the route we had known goes through San Jose, and takes well over an hour), which deposited us on the other site quite quickly. From there, the trip out was fairly uneventful, taking us past Tres RÃƒ ­os (the furthest east we had been to that point), over a fairly steep rise in the valley, then down into Cartago.<br />
Cartago is a place of pilgrimage for many Costa Ricans, notably for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuestra_Señora_de_los_Angeles_Basilica">Nuestra Señora de los Angeles Basilica</a>. It&#8217;s the home of the Virgin of the Angels, the patron (saint?) of Costa Rica. But that&#8217;s not what we were going out to see (at least, not this time). Although we did drive past the basilica, we only had the time to glance. We were still bound for our destination.<br />
(I should point out that &#8220;time&#8221; was a consideration. The Premier of China is in Costa Rica, and his arrival was wreaking havoc with traffic as they shut down highways to ease his travels. This meant we had to plan our travels carefully so we wouldn&#8217;t be caught in anything.)<br />
We continued to Paraiso, where I instructed Alex to look for a road sign to &#8220;Orosi&#8221;. Another diversion, since we weren&#8217;t actually going to the town of Orosi. Instead, towards the edge of the south side of Paraiso, we hung a left and started a weavy, windy, and steep drive down into the Orosi Valley.<br />
There are few places in the world I&#8217;ve been that stand out as being truly gorgeous. This is the sort of place I&#8217;d kill to be on a bike for a (sunny) day, just me &#8230; and my camera equipment, of course. High walls seem to surround the valley floor, which is largely taken up with a lake formed by the damming of the El RÃ­o Grande (used for hydroelectric power). The end of the lake near the dam is filled with floating vegetation, which offers a very picturesque view of the area.<br />
Shortly after 11:30, we arrived at <a href="http://www.lacasonadelcafetal.com/">La Casona del Cafetal</a>, a restaurant hidden 500 metres from the road in the middle of a coffee plantation. We&#8217;d come for the buffet (this was the root of the surprise), which is filled with traditional Costa Rican foods. Although some of the staff do speak English (far better than I can speak Spanish), that&#8217;s about where the catering to gringos stops. After that, it&#8217;s all Tico. I think Alex, Mi Pequeña Niña, and I were the only gringos there.<br />
Which, really, is fine with me.<br />
La Casona is perched on a small rise overlooking the lake. Although the day was cloudy, the view was still fantastic. I&#8217;m sure on a sunny day, the view can&#8217;t be beat. It was definitely a great place to go for brunch.<br />

All morning, Alex and I had thought MPN was sick. She was sneezing a lot, her nose was running, and she had teary eyes. (We would later check with Nana &#8212; my mom &#8212; to get confirmation that it was just teething. Oddly enough, my little girl has yet to have a cold.) None of the ooziness seemed to diminish her appetite as she tore into almost everything put in front of her. (She avoided the carrots.)<br />
Being in the middle of a coffee plantation, I figured this place had to have good coffee. I kept asking Alex if she wanted one. At first she didn&#8217;t, but after getting some food, she changed her mind. And when she said &#8220;sÃ­ ­&#8221;, I added &#8220;dos&#8221;.  You could have knocked Alex over with a feather.<br />
It reminded me of when I first started to drink alcohol. Yep, time for a flashback&#8230;<br />
New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1995. It would be my last New Year&#8217;s in Ottawa &#8212; I got the flu the following year, and the year after that I was preparing to move from Toronto to Vancouver. But in 1995, a small platoon of us had traveled up to Ottawa, and were arranged around a massive circular table at the <a href="http://www.yangtze.ca/">Yangtze chinese restaurant</a> along Somerset, about four blocks from Chris&#8217; apartment.<br />
There were around 20 of us (a bit of a guess, my memory is a little fuzzy for obvious reasons), all of whom knew each other quite well. And one thing they all knew about me: I didn&#8217;t drink. It wasn&#8217;t for any reason, that&#8217;s just the way it was. Everyone accepted it &#8212; razzed me about it, I should add &#8212; but never forced anything.<br />
The waitress was taking orders, going around the table one person at a time, getting the list of people. When she got to Therese, Stuart, and Liz, the three of them decided to order a bottle of wine between them and asked if anyone else wanted some. For some reason &#8212; and likely no more reason than &#8220;just &#8216;cuz&#8221; &#8212; I decided that it might be nice to have some, too. Somehow, between all the commotion in the restaurant, the confusion of orders, and my not-quite-seen (or heard) motions, everyone missed that I&#8217;d put myself in with the order. Including the waitress, although she&#8217;d heard the &#8220;me, too&#8221;.<br />
When the waitress returned with the wine and four glasses, she could only figure out where the first three were supposed to go. She asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who had the fourth glass of wine?</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>That would be me.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could have heard a pin drop. The entire table was silent &#8212; the only time for the next many hours that these people would be silent &#8212; and stayed that way for couple of heartbeats. The moment was broken by Stuart, who chipped in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Geoff&#8217;s gettin&#8217; liquored tonight!</p></blockquote>
<p>Such was the experience when Alex heard me order a coffee. For a moment she thought that I was correcting her order, and almost got our waitress to change it. She caught herself about to speak, and then looked at me in sheer shock. Me, her husband of 3 1/4 years, whom had shunned all coffee for the entirety of his life, was about to have a first cup.<br />
Drama, of course, ensued. The moment, for you doubters, was even captured on video.<br />
Now there are a significant number of people whom I&#8217;ve met over the years who were (and in many cases, still are) abjectly terrified of the idea of me drinking coffee. Certainly, a third of my life ago, that would definitely be true. Drinking that much caffeine as a younger man might have well turned me into a Jekyll and Hyde sort of personality (if you doubt me, ask the people who knew me in university), and that prospect scared the bejeezus out of them.<br />
One advantage of age: calm. Well, as calm as a guy like me can get. And frankly, calm enough that I wanted to try coffee. Living in Costa Rica, I feel like I&#8217;m being left out whenever I pass the coffee aisle (I jest not!) and savour the aroma. I love the smell of coffee, and the taste of coffee in things that I&#8217;ve eaten and drank. But coffee itself? I&#8217;d seen too many addicts of coffee to want to go that far&#8230;<br />
Still, I had to know.<br />
The coffee came not as a simple cup, but as a <a href="http://www.zurqui.com/crinfocus/cr/coffee.html">chorreador</a>. This is the way you drink coffee Costa Rican-style. The waitress poured in the hot water, and we waited for the coffee to fill the brown mug underneath. When it was ready, I sniffed at the steam that wafted from the top, not unlike sampling the nose of a fine wine (Alex probably thinks it was a wasted effort &#8212; the coffee was actually too strong).<br />
[flickr]photo:3039229692(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3039229726(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
The first sip brought forth the taste of &#8230; well, coffee beans. I know, I know, that sounds like a really stupid thing to say, but the reality is that this was not exactly what I&#8217;d expected. Having only ever tasted coffee blended with other things, the taste of the other things masked some of the coffee flavour. So it wasn&#8217;t quite what I was expecting.<br />
[flickr]photo:3039232914(small)[/flickr]<br />
But it was far from bad.<br />
And yes, I liked it.<br />
In fact, as I continued to drink the cup, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that things seem to look almost a little different. Colours seemed to be more saturated. Details became a little sharper. Everyone seemed to move just a little bit more slowly.<br />
Alex just continued to make fun of this, mockingly worried that we were going to have to set up a full import business to keep up to my coffee habit. (I hadn&#8217;t even finished my first cup.) I drank it straight, black, no sugar. I figured I had to know what true coffee tastes like before I start adding other things to it.<br />
Oddly enough, the drive home seemed to go a little more quickly than the drive in, even though I took a couple wrong turns (as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, not all the roads here are well-marked).  And I had serious trouble sleeping.<br />
Not that I think it&#8217;s at all related.</p>
