								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sit here at my kitchen table, rubbing the weariness from my eyes. Not the things you&#8217;d normally hear from me, mind you &#8212; I haven&#8217;t been working too hard as of late (as you know, my big project is done). No, this is from something much better &#8212; spending time with my family, and notably you, Monkey.<br />
The last four days have been a lot of fun. Maybe even too much fun. Both of us are pretty pooped. You went to bed and for the first time in a long while, there wasn&#8217;t hours of chatter from your room. I think you pretty much passed out. I won&#8217;t be too far behind you, I think, but I do wish to describe the fun that we&#8217;ve shared.<br />
&#8216;Cuz, frankly, I&#8217;m not sure how the heck I survived it all&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-2688"></span>First off was Canada Day. This year, Mommy and I decided to try a visit at Heritage Park. If you got there early enough, you got a free pancake breakfast. It seemed like a fun thing to do. And it probably would have been more fun if it had been a few degrees warmer &#8212; it was rather chilly for the first day of July.<br />
Still, you had a lot of fun. Once we&#8217;d gobbled down the pancakes, we went and got ride tickets. You swung on a vintage ship-styled swing, rode the big steam train around the park, went on the paddlewheeler out in Glenmore Reservoir (although you barely stopped moving the entire time, necessitating me following you around the entire time), and went on the merry-go-round (you demanded to ride the white horse).<br />
You ate a pretzel, and drank some frozen lemonade with me. We saw the farm animals (you mooed at the cows, and nearly had your bright red Crocs eaten by a misguided horse). Then we went through Gasoline Alley. By this point, you were tired and got fairly cranky, so we all opted to go home.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762441701(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762451847(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762453683(square)[/flickr]<br />
Mommy wanted to go visit with Grandpa for a week, and had to take Choo Choo with her. (Choo Choo&#8217;s still nursing, so she goes wherever Mommy goes.) But &#8230; well, Monkey, all me to be rather honest for a moment &#8212; travelling with you lately requires a lot of high-test drugs to keep people calm. Either you or us, it doesn&#8217;t matter. But Mommy travelling with you and Choo Choo wasn&#8217;t even discussed as an option, and Mommy really wanted to go without all of us in tow. (You&#8217;ll understand this years from now, when you have a near-3 year old.)<br />
Of course, what all that means is, it was just you and me, kid. And we got off to it before Mommy and Choo Choo&#8217;s plane had taken off.<br />
Our first stop was the Galaxie Diner on 11th St., not far from Grandma&#8217;s house. There we enjoyed a filling breakfast, because we had a long day of chasing trains ahead of you. I hadn&#8217;t chased a train since before you were born, and I was itching to go out and take pictures. I figured you might like to see a big train in motion, and when my friend Graham told me CP 2816 was going out to Banff on 2 July, I couldn&#8217;t resist.<br />
After breakfast, we went home just long enough to get a few things together (like my camera), and then we went searching for our first place to wait. I originally thought of a place known as Keith, which is roughly where Stoney Trail crosses the Bow River. But as we came down Sarcee Trail towards the highway, I spied an even better location: where the train tracks cross 32nd Ave NW. It would give me an easy access for photography, a decent backdrop, and not far from the highway to get back out again.<br />
We ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked. One thing you&#8217;ll learn, kiddo, is that when you chase trains, you have to be patient and wait. A lot. Even though Graham was sending me text messages on the train&#8217;s status, it didn&#8217;t come quickly. We saw a freight train have to wait for CP 2816, too. But eventually, we got the note that she was heading west. Before long, we could hear its whistle echo through the valley. It came towards us, barrelling along as fast as it could, belching out black smoke.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762469809(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4763109230(square)[/flickr]<br />
For a moment, I saw myself in you. When I was your age (maybe a little older), your granddad (my daddy) used to take my family (Nana, Auntie Cathy, and me) to the train tracks near our house, to watch another steam locomotive &#8212; CN 6060 &#8212; come racing by, huge clouds of black smoke filling up the sky. It used to scare the hell out of me. Of course, I look back at that now and I feel really glad that I did see that &#8212; it&#8217;s a fond memory. I hope maybe one day, it is for you, too.<br />
We hit the road and headed out to a place out towards the mountains called Ozada. You were asleep before we were outside city limits, and slept all the way there. Ozada is on the Stoney Indian reserve, and is one of Canadian Pacific&#8217;s old stations for servicing steam locomotives. (The concrete pylons for the coaling and water towers are still visible.) Today, it&#8217;s little more than a siding in the middle of nowhere, just off the highway. And we waited there because Graham had told me CP 2816 would be stopping there for servicing as well.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762477071(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762477937(square)[/flickr]<br />
We were not disappointed. We saw the train come in slowly, pass by, and stop in the siding. After it had passed, we drove to the other end of the siding, and watched it race westward. (The train was about two hours late, so they had a reason to move quickly.) We drove out to the highway, and saw the train&#8217;s smoke as we drove by it on the highway. We saw some other people we&#8217;d seen back in Calgary stop at the side of the highway to take more pictures.<br />
Finally, we stopped in Banff, and waited about halfway between the station and Bankhead. We had to wait a long, long time before we saw CP 2816&#8217;s lights. As CP 2816 was going on show at the station, the train stopped again not far from us for one last servicing before going in. This gave us a fantastic view, although the whistles did give you a bit of a scare &#8212; they were quite loud.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762480609(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4763119200(square)[/flickr]<br />
After meeting up with Graham at the station (it seemed only fair to thank him in person for the information), we had lunch at Bruno&#8217;s, and then headed back to Calgary. You slept from Canmore all the way home.<br />
On Saturday, you and I went to the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market, mostly so you could go to the jumping castle &#8212; probably your most favourite thing in town (after me, of course). You ate your mixed berry crepe almost as fast as I could eat my ham and cheese crepe. I swear it&#8217;s the only thing you eat quickly &#8212; everything else requires a pry bar and a shovel&#8230;<br />
When I asked what you wanted to do next, you said: &#8220;I want [to see the] giraffes!&#8221; So off we went to the zoo. We went though the dinosaurs, then over to the giraffes, zipped by the gorillas, and spent a lot of time at the playground (you love the playground, there). Then it was into the Australian  pavilion  (I was devastated to find that the nocturnal animal area is permanently closed), through the monkey house, and then over to the elephants (where we had hot dogs), zipped over to the carousel (just opened), before going through the Canadian Wilds (where you were completely obsessed with the prairie dogs).<br />
[flickr]photo:4763125998(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762491661(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762511327(square)[/flickr]<br />
For dinner, I took you to a Japanese restaurant. I found that your chopstick skills had degraded quite a lot &#8212; we&#8217;ll have to work on that. But you ate half of the edamame, a couple of avocado rolls, and even a piece of hamachi sashimi (well, it was nigiri sushi, but it was just plain easier to give you just the fish). You wouldn&#8217;t touch the miso soup (I&#8217;ll work on that, too). For your first shot, I was very proud of you.<br />
The next morning, we walked over to the #2 bus stop. You were ecstatic about riding the bus. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s from singing <em>The Wheels On The Bus</em> so much.   We went to the Silver Dragon restaurant, where we met up with my friend Tamara and her husband, Dan. There we ate dim sum (Mommy was rather annoyed that we went without her). It was so good. You ate buns, and pork dumplings, and quite a lot of deep fried squid. Yes, you ate squid. I kid you not. Mind you, as I&#8217;ve said to others, the squid tastes a lot like scrambled eggs. So I told you it was scrambled eggs. You couldn&#8217;t get enough.<br />
Following dim sum, you and I walked along the river over to Eau Claire Market (which really isn&#8217;t a market anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s mostly businesses and empty store space &#8212; nothing like it used to be), where you and I saw Toy Story 3. I cried a bit. You seemed to like it a lot, though. Especially anything with Woody.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762516489(square)[/flickr]<br />
In fact, you like Woody and Jesse (the Yodelling Cowgirl) so much, and because the Calgary Stampede is just around the corner, we walked over to Stephen Avenue afterwards to try and get you a cowgirl outfit. You&#8217;ve got the boots and jeans, but you need a hat and a shirt. Sadly, we were less than successful &#8212; no-one seemed to have a cowgirl shirt in your size.<br />
On the way home, much to our luck, we ran into Grandma on the bus (she was coming to our house, anyway &#8212; we just had really good timing). You had some fun with Grandma while I went off to get something for us to eat for dinner.<br />
In fact, I&#8217;m so tired from all of this excitement that it&#8217;s taken me a while to write all of this. But I hope you had fun, Monkey. I know I did.<br />
And now, I need to go to bed. &#8216;Cuz I&#8217;m really, really, <em>really</em> tired.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was skipping through my various feeds this morning, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/olympics/2518676/Beijing-Olympics-George-Bush-calls-on-China-to-improve-human-rights-record.html">I came across the following quote</a> from Jacques Rogge, President of the IOC:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said the Games would &#8220;help the world to understand China, and it will also help China to understand the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we need to send a team into the IOC&#8217;s fantasy world and extract them, because they&#8217;ve clearly (and totally) misunderstood the situation.<br />
<span id="more-1029"></span>I have two fundamental issues with that quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>The world will not understand China</li>
<li>China has no interest in understanding the world</li>
</ol>
<p>Why won&#8217;t the world understand China? Because the world doesn&#8217;t want to. China is the world&#8217;s   (current) longest-standing culture. Over 5,000 years of history &#8230; a lot of it engaged in conflicts. Not so much war with others, but mostly with themselves. That&#8217;s 5,000 years of political instability, dictatorships (the Emperors weren&#8217;t exactly the nicest of people), insurrections, and various foreign invasions (Mongols, British, and Japanese, to name but a few).<br />
In a country with 1.3 billion people (70% of whom are rural farmers) and a very long history of political upheaval, you can&#8217;t really blame the so-called Communist Party (by textbook definition, China isn&#8217;t communist, nor has there ever been a truly communist government) for being so strong-armed. It could be even viewed (on an optimistic level) that this is more about ensuring the stability of China as a nation than it is about political power.<br />
If you were being optimistic. I could go pessimistic, but that&#8217;s another post&#8230;<br />
Here&#8217;s the problem, though: The world wishes to impose its political views on China. The world wants China to be democratic. The world wants China to end its human rights abuses. <em>The world wants China to change.</em> This isn&#8217;t an act of understanding. This is the world pointing it&#8217;s finger at China.<br />
China, on the other hand, is sort of like a bull. It&#8217;s a big, heavy animal that pretty much does what it wants, when it wants. Everyone needs that bull for various things (bulls are handy things to have on the global ranch), but if you ask that bull to do something it doesn&#8217;t want to do, it&#8217;s not going to do it. It doesn&#8217;t need to, and it&#8217;s quite content to stay the way it is.<br />
More importantly, China doesn&#8217;t want to take direction from outsiders. It has its own view of what it needs to survive, and the views of the rest of the world don&#8217;t really matter. Why? Because even with everything &#8220;bad&#8221; that China does, everyone still buys &#8220;Made In China&#8221; because it&#8217;s cheaper than buying it elsewhere. The money keeps coming, so China has no need to change. (Ain&#8217;t greed grand?)<br />
Hence, there is no need for China to understand the world. Ergo, it won&#8217;t.<br />
So, a note to the IOC: I dunno where the heck you people have been for the last decade, but you really shouldn&#8217;t be surprised with the situation you&#8217;re walking into. China is effectively third-world in terms of its industrialisation, political system, environmental controls, and judicial process. Their economy makes them damn near the most powerful country on Earth (they own a seriously large chunk of the United States&#8217; debt). Hence all the pollution, lack of access to free information, and all their reasons to crack down on perceived freedoms.<br />
Expect protests and expect problems. The Olympics in Beijing have only just started, but you should expect that you&#8217;ll be hearing about these for years to come.<br />
(Incidentally, if my blog isn&#8217;t already blocked in China, this should pretty much prevent it from ever being seen there. Oh well.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03526.JPG" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" width="300" /></a><br />
Our British Airways 747 to London:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03527.JPG" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" width="300" /></a><br />
The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03533.JPG" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03567.JPG" alt="A small, nameless Siberian village" width="300" /></a><br />
And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a><br />
We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a><br />
A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a><br />
Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a><br />
I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03674.JPG" alt="Get on the train!" width="300" /></a><br />
Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03675.JPG" alt="No Flowing Back" width="300" /></a><br />
One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />

Ferry traffic!<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One last thing we needed to do before we leave the Hong Kong area was check out Hong Kong&#8217;s forgotten half-sister, Macau. Macau was founded a couple hundred years earlier than Hong Kong by the Portuguese, and was originally the heavy weight title holder of foreign trading port until the British dethroned it with, shall we say, some less-than gentlemanly behaviour to get their way (I refer to the events leading up to the Treaty of Nanking).<br />
Getting from Hong Kong to Macau is a fairly simple process: you either go overland (through China, which we can&#8217;t do since we&#8217;ve officially left China and don&#8217;t have a multiple-entry visa), or you take a ferry. While Macau might be Hong Kong&#8217;s forgotten half-sister, they seem to have a pretty solid relationship, especially now since they&#8217;ve both returned to the stewardship of China. The ferry service is perfectly representative of this &#8212; they run every 15 minutes.<br />
<span id="more-579"></span><a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03733.JPG" alt="We took the smaller one on the right" width="300" /></a><br />
The trip is 65 kms in between. It takes about on an hour. On a hydrofoil. How cool is that??<br />
Macau is simultaneously different than Hong Kong, and very similar. It&#8217;s similar because, like Hong Kong, it&#8217;s a place where two cultures collide and coexist. It&#8217;s different because you don&#8217;t see English a lot (you do hear it, though, English is well-known), it&#8217;s mostly Portuguese (obviously).<br />
Macau is small &#8212; much more than Hong Kong. You can walk around much of Macau Island in a fairly short period of time. After endulging in another round of dim sum, we proceeded to walk pretty much right around the southern tip and up to a small temple called A-Ma. It was easy to see the Macau Tower as we rounded the tip, on our way.<br />
Following the temple, we walked along the walking path suggested by the Lonely Planet guide, but only in reverse. At least until we got rained on. A lot. Near torrential downpour. That kind of slowed us down. We were actually trapped under an eaves for about half an hour waiting for Niagara Falls to let up enough for us to continue on our way. As it stands, it barely let up enough for us to find a cafe to hold out until the rain stopped.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03729.JPG" alt="Caught in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03730.JPG" alt="It got harder before it got better" width="300" /></a><br />
Not long after, we found a main square (the name of which now escapes me) that has very interesting tiling on the surface. There&#8217;s a fountain in the centre surrounded by lotus flowers. After the square, Amy and I kind of wandered a bit aimlessly until we found ourselves at the Royal Hotel &#8212; mostly to escape the intense heat and humidity for a while. There, we realized that sticking around in Macau, though nice, wasn&#8217;t entirely what we had in mind. A quick visit to the ruins of St. Paul, and we&#8217;d head back to Hong Kong.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03731.JPG" alt="Main square in Macau" width="300" /></a><br />
The ruins of St. Paul are what is left of a grand cathedral that caught fire and burned to the ground &#8230; except for the facade, which still stands (partly thanks to a supporting structure still in place). It sits very out of place with the rest of the buildings surrounding it, except for the fort sitting next to it. The fort is quite old, dating back a few hundred years. The view from up there is quite good. The Macau Museum is there, too, but we didn&#8217;t get a chance to see it &#8212; the museums are all closed on Mondays.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03732.JPG" alt="A view of Macau from the fort" width="300" /></a><br />
Back in Hong Kong, we went immediately to dinner at Jade Garden, a thoroughly uninspired restaurant in Star House. (If you&#8217;re in Hong Kong, and reading Lonely Planet, take their advice and don&#8217;t go there. There are plenty of other much better restaurants in Kowloon &#8230; and plenty more in Hong Kong, for the HK$2.20 ferry fare.)<br />
Sadly, we saw not much of Macau. There is definitely more there to see.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I complain a lot.<br />
Unintentionally, I swear, but I do.<br />
(Amy says I like to complain, but I actually hate it. I don&#8217;t even realize I&#8217;m complaining until I complain. I complain to myself that I complain, and get stuck in a vicious cycle of complaint. But I digress&#8230;)<br />
<span id="more-578"></span>It&#8217;s hot here. I know I&#8217;ve mentioned this several times, but it&#8217;s hard to really appreciate how hot it is until you&#8217;ve been to a place like this. Amy has, so this doesn&#8217;t really seem to bother her much. I, although raised in a hot and humid environment, never liked it. (This is why I love living in Calgary.) And even in the shade or on a cloudy day (such as it is today), it&#8217;s still hot. Sweating is simply unavoidable. The goal is more survival to stay cool.<br />
I mention, maybe every ten minutes or so (read: complain constantly) that it&#8217;s too hot. Although Amy agrees, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s an unspoken &#8220;I know, now shut up about it, already!&#8221; that goes along with it.<br />
It&#8217;s hot. Have I mentioned that it&#8217;s hot? It&#8217;s far too hot. I don&#8217;t understand how it can be this hot. Man, I&#8217;m hot.<br />
And yet, Amy hasn&#8217;t killed me yet. Way more patience than me, I gotta say&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The dim sum curse is lifted, finally! After a few days of trying to figure out where to go, we hit Hong Kong Island to see what we could find. Our concierge had recommended a place called &#8220;Luk Yu Teahouse&#8221;, which according to the Lonely Planet guide is full of surly staff. When we got there, it wasn&#8217;t even close to full &#8212; a sure sign of a not-so-good dim sum.<br />
We tried another nearby restaurant that we&#8217;d spied a couple of days ago. Didn&#8217;t look any better. At this point, I was willing to walk 100 miles for good dim sum. We&#8217;d backed down twice on dim sum, going for something that looked decent, rather than what we&#8217;d really wanted. I wasn&#8217;t willing to back down a third time.<br />
<span id="more-577"></span>I think Amy was about to ready to strangle me. She holds her composure a <em>lot</em> better than I do.<br />
Our third and final attempt was a place called Fung Shing, next to the Western Market building. The LP guide said it was &#8220;cavernous&#8221;. I honestly think the LP guides really need to check their use of the English language &#8212; &#8220;cavernous&#8221; doesn&#8217;t do the place justice. It&#8217;s large, yes, but the ceiling is just too low to require a word with such connotations.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03722.JPG" width="300" alt="Fung Shing in the Western Market" /></a><br />
I have an English degree, so gimme a break here, eh?<br />
It didn&#8217;t have the carts we so highly desired. But it was packed to the gills with locals &#8212; the bare minimum for good dim sum. The food quality was also quite good, though the English menu (which, sadly, we had to use) didn&#8217;t offer nearly the variety the Chinese menu did. It was too bad we were unable to get a hold of Vitralis, a connection we were provided, to try and hook up for dim sum. But you make do when you can.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03719.JPG" width="300" alt="Dim summy goodness" /></a><br />
Stuffed, our one true mission in Hong Kong was complete. The only meal goal left on the trip &#8212; at least for me &#8212; is sushi at Tsukiji Market in Tokyo, and zushi (yes, it&#8217;s spelled that way, too) in Osaka.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the record, we didn&#8217;t it plan it this way. But like many things on our trip, fortuitious circumstance happened to place us in Hong Kong on the first day of the Dragon Boat festival!<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03714.JPG" alt="Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival at Stanley Beach" width="300" /></a><br />
Having first tried dragon boating last year, I was curious to see how the Big Buoys (yes, bad joke) do it out here in Hong Kong, where the sport reigns. There are many differences from how I did it in Calgary last year, and what seems to happen here.<br />
<span id="more-576"></span>First, there isn&#8217;t one big dragon boat match &#8212; there&#8217;s a bunch of them. (There&#8217;s an international competition held in September or October, this isn&#8217;t part of that.) Each little town or village, even islands, have their own competitions. Based on what we read in a magazine, we settled on Stanley, at the south end of Hong Kong Island.<br />
Whoever said &#8220;getting there is half the fun&#8221; hasn&#8217;t tried riding a Hong Kong city bus from Tsim Sha Tsui to Stanley. The 973, although a picturesque route, takes 90 minutes due to the curvy, non-direct highways and the insane level of traffic (it is a weekend, after all). My butt was numb by the time we got there. At least the buses are air conditioned. However, that makes getting off <em>very</em> painful &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking into a sauna.<br />
Our first stop was not the beach, though, where the competition is held. It was at a place called the Stanley Restaurant. (If Amy didn&#8217;t eat right away, I feared she might start looking at me like hungry characters do in cartoons, and think I&#8217;m a hot dog or something.) A bowl of wonton and noodle soup (along with several teams of dragonboaters), and we headed down to the beach.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03715.JPG" alt=" Stanley Beach" width="300" /></a><br />
It was <strong>packed</strong>. People were everywhere. Announcements were in Cantonese, with a bit of English thrown in for us white folks. (There were a few of us.) There were teams from all over Hong Kong, including a few from Canada: University of Toronto, University of Western Ontario, and my own alma mater, University of Waterloo.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03716.JPG" alt="The Waterloo Warriors" width="300" /></a><br />
As I would find out later, they&#8217;re alumni who moved from HK to Waterloo, then moved back after graduating. They tried to draft me, but I haven&#8217;t even started training for my own team this year!<br />
As Amy so eloquently pointed out, the heat was nigh-unbearable. The only way we survived as long as we did was standing in the water up to our knees. (I&#8217;m not sure that I would have wanted to swim there, anyway, but&#8230;) When we could finally take no more, we headed back. Another 90 minutes on the bus.<br />
Trains are suddenly looking so much better, now that we&#8217;ve taken them for granted.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After meeting up with Amy, following our mutual attire sizings (and having a snack in a very Irish bar, oddly sitting amidst a lot of very Chinese surroundings), we took a ride up the Victora Peak Tram.<br />
<span id="more-575"></span><a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/11/going-uphill-to-victoria-peak-3/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03700.JPG" alt="Hong Kong Victoria Peak Tram" width="300" /></a><br />
The tram was started in 1888 by the British so they could get to their pricey places of residence without having to slog all the way up the hill. Still in operation (though with quite a few overhauls), the system has run (except during WWII) without a single accident. Impressive, considering some of the climb is quite steep. Buildings look insanely comical out the window. Especially at night.<br />
A round-trip costs about HK$30 (roughly CDN$5), and is worth the trip. Especially for views like this:<br />

Though do please keep in mind that this was with my dinky little camera, which has to be coaxed to take pictures like this, especially when it really doesn&#8217;t want to&#8230;<br />
If you&#8217;re wondering what Hong Kong looks like at night from the other side, check this out&#8230;<br />
