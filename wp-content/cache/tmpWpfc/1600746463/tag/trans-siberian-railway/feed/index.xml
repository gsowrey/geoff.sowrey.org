										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not quite two years ago, I had the <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/">pleasure of riding trains from St. Petersburg, Russia all the way to Hong Kong</a>. Quite the experience, let me tell you.<br />
One part of it was riding the Trans Siberian Railway from Moscow to Ulan Ude, where the Trans Siberian effectively becomes the Trans Mongolian, as we cut through Mongolia to Beijing.  The trains (as there are many that ply the line) vary from relatively nice (the one from Krasnoyarsk to Urkutsk was pretty nice) to pretty cruddy (Urkutsk to <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/17/the-last-russian-stop/">Ulan Ude</a>), with various points in between.<br />
<span id="more-716"></span>Mind you, we never rode in the platskartny class &#8212; cars filled with open-plan bunks. We stuck to second class cabins (four people each) and once in first class (<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/13/a-hopefully-brief-stop-in-krasnoyarsk/">out of sheer desperation to get the hell out of Krasnoyarsk</a>).<br />
<a href="http://www.gwtravel.co.uk/">GW Travel</a>, famous for doing uber-expensive train trips, is now opening the formerly more rough-and-tumble experience of <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070426/od_uk_nm/oukoe_uk_russia_rail">crossing Siberia by running a luxury train</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s kind of funny, really. We travelled without showers, good food, air conditioning (or heating), or toilets that really resembled anything sanitary. But that&#8217;s also part of the appeal! The Trans Siberian is for people, and tourists are considered a bit of an irritation, I&#8217;d wager (&#8220;damn kids and their huge backpacks!&#8221;).<br />
$22,000 for the trip? I think we did all of our travel for a tenth of that&#8230;</p>

Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />

The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />

Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />

Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />

And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />

We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />

A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />

Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />

We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />

This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />

It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />

We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />

I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />

Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />

One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />

Jackie Chan apparently heavily sponsors California Fitness. He&#8217;s probably an owner.<br />

We had this at a sushi restaurant in Chiba. We thought it was some weird pickled eel. It was eggplant:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re in Ulan Ude now, having arrived a bit later last night than scheduled. (Mind you, it took a half hour to walk from the train to the hotel.)<br />
It&#8217;s a nice little city of about a half million &#8230; and no birch trees!!! <em>Finally.</em><br />
We&#8217;ll be here until <strong>early</strong> tomorrow morning, when we leave for Mongolia. I&#8217;m not particularly looking forward to such an early morning, I&#8217;ll tell you.<br />
Slept mostly on the train, which was about the only way to pass through the pain. It&#8217;s a six and a half hour trip from Irkutsk to Ulan Ude, a distance of no more than 300 km (straight-line, that is). The train needs to take a few bendy twists going through the mountains, pass through a couple of tunnels, and then plods along at an agonizingly slow 50 km/h (estimated). I think we topped out at a few places around 80.<br />
The eastern shore of Lake Baikal was frozen &#8212; ice as far as you could see. The exact opposite of what we&#8217;d seen in Listvyanka two days ago. It looks like it&#8217;s thawing quickly, though, so it shouldn&#8217;t be long before the clear waters show through.<br />
Two of our housemates in Irkutsk (a pair of Aussies) told us two things: 1) that we&#8217;d love Mongolia (something we&#8217;d both strongly suspected), and 2) China would wear us down fast. It&#8217;s chaotic, the toilets are disaster areas (that actually scares us), the &#8220;queues&#8221; aren&#8217;t, and pretty much everything we&#8217;d wanted to see is buried under scaffolding. It seems everyone is upgrading this year.<br />
We&#8217;re just waiting for our tour to start today &#8212; we actually got a guide for here &#8212; and will be back later with more. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ekaterinburg (Soviet name, a much harsher &#8220;Sverdlovsk&#8221;) is a wonderful little place to spend an afternoon. Assuming you can find your hotel, that is.<br />
After doing our little thing at the post office to try and catch up on postings, Amy and I did about the only thing we had time for: a walking tour. Fortunately, our Lonely Planet book on the Trans Siberian Railway has a walking tour laid out pretty well. It was just a matter for us to walk it.<br />
<span id="more-538"></span><a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03564.JPG" alt="The river in downtown Ekaterinburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Starting off at the river downtown (actually, the result of a dam that you don&#8217;t even realize is a dam), you head east to a traffic circle, then north to a memorial to soldiers killed in the Afghan conflict. Then you&#8217;re supposed to head a bit west and then north to find a park. Sadly, I took us north, forgetting the west. Result: we walked too far, and missed the park. Amy got us back on track, and soon were sauntering through a rather picturesque little set of trees.<br />
On the opposite side is the site where the Russian Royal Family was murdered on 16 July 1917. The house where their brutal execution took place was actually levelled by Boris Yeltsin (then governor of the area) back in the 70s. It now sports a small iron cross, a marble cross (erected when the Romanov remains &#8212; or, more specifically, what are believed to be the remains) were sent to St. Petersburg for final burial. There is also a rather large church there, now, too (in addition to a much smaller wooden one). Supposedly, the Romanov family are considered saints. Personally, they were ignorant buffoons who didn&#8217;t see the tide coming in until it was too late&#8230;<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03561.JPG" alt="The iron cross marking the site of the Russian Royal family's murder" width="300" /></a><br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03562.JPG" alt="A marble tablet at the same site. I have no idea what it says." width="300" /></a><br />
Then it was a hasty retreat back to downtown for a bite to eat before running back to the station to catch our train to Krasnoyarsk. But you already know how that went&#8230;<br />

<blockquote><p>Bldg 6, prosp Lenina 54<br />
Singles/doubles with breakfast $26/30. This is the best budget option with smart, spacious rooms in a quite complex tucked away off the main road.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. So let me tell you how we found the place. First of all, we found Lenina Prospekt &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t hard. We walked all the way down to #54 (buildings aren&#8217;t individually numbered here, they go in groups). When you get into cases where buildings are in groups, they&#8217;re numbered something like 54/6 &#8212; such as the building holding our hotel.<br />
Admittedly, I don&#8217;t know what exactly Amy was looking for, but I guess I expected something a little more &#8230; less apartment-y, which is what the 54 block looked like. We found 54/5, but couldn&#8217;t find 54/6. So we started walking around. A kind gentleman, about early 40s, asked us a question. We replied, sheepishly:</p>
<blockquote><p>ya neh gavaroo pa-rooskie</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, you guessed it: &#8220;I don&#8217;t speak Russian.&#8221;<br />
This didn&#8217;t stop him, or us, and we proceeded to point, speak slowly (in both languages) until he dug out a map. Turns out that a building in the &#8220;courtyard&#8221; was the one we wanted. The side we could see was partly boarded up and covered in grafitti. We walked around to the other side and found the &#8220;Academy of Geology&#8221; sign, which we could barely read thanks to a Russian trend to use words similar to those in English, but with different spelling. The woman inside was totally unintelligable, and suggested (though her thick, steel bar window) that we should walk around the building. To the graffiti side, it seemed.<br />
Luckily, a boy about 15 years old spoke up &#8212; speaking just enough English to understand that we couldn&#8217;t find the place. Back to the old woman. Conversation, back around to the <em>side</em> (west side, to be specific) of the building to a very unmarked and handle-less door. Pressing a little black buzzer above the door called the attendant, upon which we found out, that yes, this was the place.<br />
For the record, the hotel is fairly nice, but certainly nothing special. So a word of warning to those of you looking for the hotel &#8212; it&#8217;s not clearly marked in the Lonely Planet books, and may require some assistance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few of you are probably wondering about the Russian train system. (Okay, I imagine not really <em>wondering</em> about the system, but about why I haven&#8217;t posted anything about it yet.)<br />
I never really got an appreciation for the trains back in 1989, since we were let around by guides. Now that we don&#8217;t have the luxury of someone pointing things out, we&#8217;ve had to figure it out on our own. It&#8217;s not nearly as hard as it might sound, though.<br />
<span id="more-534"></span>First, the Russian train system has become quite efficient &#8212; even though they&#8217;ve got not even twice the amount of track that Canada has, and a lot more land mass to serve. Schedules are set up so there is buffer time, allowing the trains to meet their scheduled stops regardless of delays. They&#8217;re not high-speed, either &#8212; I think we&#8217;ve topped out at about 100 km/h. (There is a high-speed train, but I have no idea where it runs.)<br />
The first train we took was the ??????? ?????? (pronounced &#8220;kraznaya strelya&#8221; &#8212; Pavel, please correct me if I got this wrong), which is Russian for &#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;. It&#8217;s Train #1 on the schedules, and runs direct from Moscow to St. Petersburg (and vice-versa, of course, since that&#8217;s how we took it) without stops. It&#8217;s as close to a luxury train as exists here. Since then, we&#8217;ve been on a commuter train (three-person bench seating), Train #28 (Moscow &#8211; Kazan), and Train #378 (Kazan &#8211; Ekaterinburg.<br />
The quality of the trains goes down as the train numbers get larger.<br />
Generally, trains are several cars long &#8212; the longest has been about 19 cars, with the average about 16 or so. There is one electric locomotive at the front that does all the work. I have no idea what the horsepower is on these things, but they do a pretty decent job of hauling.<br />
The cars are all quite heavy, which leads to a decent ride. It&#8217;s helpful that the Russians have replaced tens of thousands of kilometres of track with <acronym title="Continuously Welded Rail">CWR</acronym>, which offers a pretty smooth ride. Much of the replacement looks fairly recent, being within the last few years. There are still lengthy stretches of jointed rail, giving the familiar &#8220;clickety-clack&#8221; as you roll down the line.<br />
Each car is divided into about 10 compartments, each with four bunks. The compartments are roughly 5.5 feet wide, about 6.5 feet long, and 9 feet tall. The bunks are less than two feet wide &#8212; not a lot of room to move. One set faces forward, the other reverse. One bathroom (that we&#8217;ve seen), next to the prahdavista&#8217;s (attendant&#8217;s) cabin, has a toilet that dumps onto the tracks with a sink. There&#8217;s a samovar for hot water nearby. If you&#8217;re lucky, you can convince the attendant to lower windows to keep the temperature down in the cars.<br />
Bedrolls are rented when staying overnight for between 30 and 60 rubles, depending on phase of the moon (or some such unrelated factor). Sheets, thankfully, are delivered (upon paying the fee), clean and sealed in a plastic bag.<br />
The attendant will notify you when your stop is coming up, in case you&#8217;re not going to the end of the line. Handy, since sometimes it&#8217;s hard to know where you are. Kilometres are marked, but unless you&#8217;ve got a rail chart (which we don&#8217;t), it&#8217;s hard to know where you are.<br />
And for some goofy reason, all the trains run off of Moscow standard time, even though the stations are local time. I will never understand that one.</p>

It is simply too bad that we were only there for the day &#8212; two days should be the required minimum for a stay there.<br />
<span id="more-533"></span>After my stupidly short posting, Amy and I went to hang out in a park for a while, just to watch the city from a distance. Then it was down to the Central Market. The intention had been to buy food for the trip to Ekaterinburg. However, Amy found a stall selling (what she believes is) wool yarn. And lots of it. Cheap.<br />
I really wish I&#8217;d captured her exchange on film. She had to find a way to explain the concept of two-ply yarn to the vendor. Eventually, they figured it out and Amy walked away with 10 balls of the stuff. Thankfully, I don&#8217;t have to carry that, but she&#8217;s going to need to ship something home before too long&#8230;<br />
The trip to Ekaterinburg was hot. We were in a room with two quiet guys who didn&#8217;t particularly thrill either Amy or myself. Thankfully, not drunkards, though. That&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been fearing running into. I&#8217;ve been practising saying &#8220;I&#8217;m an alcoholic&#8221; because it&#8217;s apparently the only way to avoid being nagged into doing vodka shots.<br />
Now to explore Ekaterinburg!</p>
