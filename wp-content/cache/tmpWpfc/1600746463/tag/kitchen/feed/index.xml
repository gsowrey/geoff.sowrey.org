										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, since I last wrote, much has happened in the house. In our previous installment, the floors were starting to come up. Since then, a lot as happened, and we&#8217;ve had the prerequisite miscommunications, strange discoveries, and mild panic attacks (from us, the client &#8212; our contractor is likely annoyed as hell with us at this point).<br />
But if there&#8217;s one thing I can say, we have progress. Lots of it.<br />
<span id="more-3011"></span>Since we last chatted, the floors have completely come up in the kitchen. However, the subfloor isn&#8217;t perfectly level. The contractor said the addition on our kitchen was a &#8220;handyman special&#8221;, which I gather is a term for &#8220;put together very quickly, and not enough attention was paid to the right things&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t the least bit surprised.<br />
<a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2012/03/the-kitchen-reno-moves-along/the-now-missing-wall-next-to-the-entrance/' title='The (now missing) wall next to the entrance'><img width="238" height="300" src="https://new.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/The-now-missing-wall-next-to-the-entrance-238x300.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignnone wp-image-3310" alt="The (now missing) wall next to the entrance" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/7003351119/">Geoff S.</a><br />
The wall near our front door is gone, as well, which exposed another issue with the house. In the original construction, there&#8217;s a 2&#215;6 beam that runs from the wall perpendicular to the front entrance over to the main load-bearing member, which runs longitudinally down the house. One 2&#215;6. Just one. 16 feet long. And it supports the weight of the gable over the living room.<br />
Those of you in the know are nodding, perhaps gravely. For the rest of you, this is the same as having a four-legged chair with one leg made out of spaghetti. You can sit on the chair if you&#8217;re careful enough, but &#8230; well, don&#8217;t be surprised if it cracks and breaks. Which is sort of what&#8217;s happening now. There&#8217;s a crack just under the joist, and the entire ceiling is bowed. (Incidentally, it&#8217;s not likely a result of the reno per se &#8212; it looks like it&#8217;s been there a long time, only we couldn&#8217;t see it until we were eye-level with the ceiling.) A second joist will be added to strengthen the ceiling and prevent potential collapse.<br />
The wall between the kitchen and living room is gone; that&#8217;s now a beam tucked into the ceiling to support the weight. The kitchen ceiling has come down (along with the paltry excuse for the insulation in our attic &#8212; something that will also be addressed) along with a fair amount of drywall in the kitchen.<br />
The electricians have come and (almost) gone, having run in the wiring for the new stove outlet, the light fixtures, and the wall sockets. The plumber will be along shortly to deal with the new fittings for the island, the new main bathroom vanity, and tweaks to our ensuite lines so we can hide them behind a pedestal sink (repurposed from our downstairs bathroom).<br />
<a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2012/03/the-kitchen-reno-moves-along/clear-view-now-without-fireplace/' title='Clear view, now without fireplace!'><img width="300" height="176" src="https://new.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/Clear-view-now-without-fireplace--300x176.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignnone wp-image-3311" alt="Clear view, now without fireplace!" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/6861453868/">Geoff S.</a><br />
The fireplace is gone. We&#8217;d discussed at length about refinishing it, then changing it to a gas insert and moving it down the wall, but in the end the sheer cost of the job combined with the reality that we don&#8217;t use a fireplace that much anyway pretty much killed the idea entirely. While I do love fireplaces &#8230; I&#8217;m not heartbroken over it. I&#8217;d rather have the space.<br />
The cabinets arrive tomorrow. (Keep in mind, folks, the first bit of destruction was only on Monday of THIS week!) That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that I can get my arse down to the cabinet builder first-thing tomorrow and half off a cheque for the remainder of the price. Our contractor is none-too-pleased about that arrangement, either. We&#8217;re only supposed to be dealing with him, but things went wonky. My guess is that the dealings with the cabinet builder&#8217;s founder had slowly changed over the last little while as the builder hired new people to help deal with the workload, and they don&#8217;t follow the contractor&#8217;s verbal agreement, single point of contact approach. (The builder&#8217;s accountant doesn&#8217;t seem to much like our contractor, as he doesn&#8217;t follow the &#8220;rules&#8221;.)<br />
For the record, I side with our contractor. Why? Because I&#8217;m a contractor. I know that world works: you do what needs to get done, and worry about the aftermath afterwards. When you&#8217;re on a schedule &#8212; which we are &#8212; any slow down like that&#8217;ll kill you. Frankly, I want my house back, so I&#8217;m quite alright to drop a cheque off and make sure this happens &#8230; fast.<br />
Anyway, the electrical walk-through is tomorrow morning, followed (I think) by city approval. Plumbing will likely occur a bit before the cabinets actually get installed, which also gets an approval. Then the walls and ceiling are seald up, cabinets go in, the countertop goes on, the floor goes in, and in theory, we have a kitchen back. (Alex will do the painting later.)<br />

Total elapsed time? Hard to say, but possibly as little as two and a half weeks. Were it me? Two and a half YEARS. Maybe decades at the rate I&#8217;m going&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Funny thing. Yesterday, when we&#8217;d thought the renovations were due to start on Tuesday (that&#8217;d be tomorrow), we weren&#8217;t exactly in a pressing need to finish getting certain appliances and a massive table out of the kitchen. Instead, we did what we could before passing out, exhausted, in bed.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Funny thing. Yesterday, when we&#8217;d thought the renovations were due to start on Tuesday (that&#8217;d be tomorrow), we weren&#8217;t exactly in a pressing need to finish getting certain appliances and a massive table out of the kitchen. Instead, we did what we could before passing out, exhausted, in bed. (Which, of course, didn&#8217;t last all night, as Choo Choo woke up crying because she wasn&#8217;t in her crib and was completely in the dark.)<br />
It&#8217;s funny, because at just after 13:00 today, I got a series of text messages from Alex saying the floor was coming out of the kitchen. The same floor that wasn&#8217;t supposed to be coming out until tomorrow. This, of course, soon turned into bits of frustration, as I was already struggling with my project at work, and suddenly my home was under attack.<br />
It&#8217;s very safe to say that I&#8217;ve had better/easier days.<br />
<span id="more-3007"></span>I&#8217;ll dispense with the work-related items, since most people wouldn&#8217;t have a freaking clue what I&#8217;m talking about, anyway. So instead, let me regale you with our home situation.<br />
As you may recall, we&#8217;re having considerable work done in the kitchen, much of which starts with floors being torn up and walls coming out. The floors started disappearing today. Two things we learned, in a short period of time: first, most of the wood flooring upstairs is very thin &#8212; only 3/8&#8243; thick (most hardwood flooring is thicker). Second, the flooring in the kitchen (more recent) was apparently done by an &#8220;amateur&#8221;, since the maple hardwood (5/8&#8243; thick) was put overtop the old linoleum (a swirlly limey-green), which was itself asphalted to the subfloor &#8212; all of which needs to be torn out.<br />
The term, ladies and gentlemen, is &#8220;painful&#8221;. All that flooring is heavily screwed, glued, and nailed. I can&#8217;t imagine how long it&#8217;ll take to come out.<br />
Anyway, I had to make a dash home after work today to get the stove, &#8220;new&#8221; microwave, dishwasher, and our kid-strength (&#8220;industrial&#8221; is far too weak for our needs) dining table out of the kitchen. That got me in a discussion with &#8220;Curly&#8221;, our contractor&#8217;s newest hire, who was engaged in the floor removal. He&#8217;s a chatty one, that.<br />
Tomorrow, I gather, the wall comes out. (And likely the fireplace, given where it sits.) Should be interesting, given the piping and wiring present within. If nothing else, it&#8217;ll be more progress.<br />
Pictures to come soon!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, if you read the note about Choo Choo&#8217;s birthday, then you know that we did a little bit of the reno work today. The single most major part of our reno work upstairs is the kitchen, and it&#8217;s basically getting stripped right down to the floor &#8212; the subfloor, that is. So that means everything needs to come out, and that&#8217;s an opportunity to try and make back a few bucks on our rather large reno bill.<br />
Thankfully, Alex &#8212; the Queen of Kijiji &#8212; found a buyer for our cabinets, who was quite happy to take them off our hands. We didn&#8217;t get a lot for them, but when all&#8217;s said and done, we&#8217;re up on their disposal, rather than being further in the hole. Not that they&#8217;ve eliminated the total cost of the reno&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-3003"></span>We started early this morning, just after 7:00. (Okay, no, that&#8217;s not necessarily &#8220;early&#8221; for some of you, but please keep in mind that neither Alex nor I were in bed before midnight, and we were already pretty wiped from all the nonsense going on this week with this move.) There was a mild panic about breakfast &#8212; I didn&#8217;t know if there was enough flour for pancakes, and then I couldn&#8217;t find the salt, and I was about ready to pull the trigger and do breakfast elsewhere. Thankfully, cooler heads prevailed (that would be Alex&#8217;s), and pancakes &#8212; our Sunday tradition &#8212; were still had.<br />
We finished cleaning up the kitchen &#8212; cleaning dishes, wiping out cupboards, and making sure every counter was empty &#8212; before the gentlemen who had bought the kitchen arrived around 9:15. We&#8217;d sold them the kitchen only two days earlier, having taken quite a bit less than originally posted (but still WAY more than if we&#8217;d had to have our reno contractor take them out). The man arrived with his son (maybe in his late 20s), and promptly tried to figure out how to get the cabinets out. The kids played downstairs while I assisted with the removal (I was keen to get them out as quickly as possible, given that it was Choo Choo&#8217;s birthday, and I&#8217;d rather not be spending it renovating).<br />
This was a major learning experience for me. The man and his son had removed several kitchens, it seemed (they&#8217;d removed a very nice one the day before), and knew what they were doing. Which meant I got to ask a few dumb questions as they went along. Such as: how are kitchen cabinets built?<br />
Kitchen cabinets, at least modern ones, are build from &#8220;boxes&#8221;. The boxes, defined as uppers and lowers, are just that &#8212; boxes. Usually five-sided, sometimes four. One side is left open for access (this is where you&#8217;d find drawers and doors), and with lowers, the top is also left &#8220;open&#8221;, as it&#8217;s covered with a countertop. Even long cabinets are made up of several boxes, each box containing a set of drawers or doors. Each box is attached to the adjacent boxes, and every box is also screwed, glued, and/or nailed to the wall (notably to the studs) &#8212; lowers are often mounted on short frames to keep them off the floor.<br />
The first thing to do was the island, which as the man (whose name I&#8217;ve already sadly forgotten &#8212; let&#8217;s call him &#8220;Clint&#8221;), suggested was in at least two boxes. Turned out it was four (we&#8217;d find that out when we pulled the countertop off), but so well attached that we couldn&#8217;t get the damned thing apart. In the end, it was a rather large pry bar and a strong back (notably Clint&#8217;s &#8212; his son, Dallas, was tackling the uppers at the time) that pulled it free. It BARELY got out our rear door.<br />
One by one, the cabinets boxes fell &#8212; both figurative, and in once case, literally. One of the uppers &#8212; the one that had been above the fridge &#8212; suddenly gave way and dropped straight down onto the floor. I was rather amazed at how little Clint seemed to mind, given that he&#8217;d forked out nearly a grand for all the boxes. (I suppose that he&#8217;ll make it back enough not to mind.) Wires getting in the way were quickly dealt with using a pair of side-cutters &#8212; Clint reminds me very much of my brother-in-law, Craig, who doesn&#8217;t bother with turning off breakers. Clint just cut right through the line, let the short-circuit trip the breaker downstairs and move on.<br />
You gotta admire &#8212; or fear &#8212; that kind of confidence in one&#8217;s tools.<br />
I lent a hand all along, not because I didn&#8217;t trust the two men, but because I know it&#8217;s not an easy job, and any extra hands often helps out. By 11:30, the cabinets were out and being loaded onto a trailer and a pickup bed. And we went for a much-needed lunch.<br />
Upon return, I resumed my little destructive habits in our ensuite. Alex (the Queen of Kijiji) had lined up a buyer for it, and there was a bit of a pressing need to get it out. I&#8217;d managed to remove the countertop (a faux marble), which was a challenge at best since it EXACTLY fit the width of the room (it&#8217;s a narrow space). The cabinet boxes were effectly wedged into place with a pair of strips of wood (well, particle board) that made getting the boxes out damned near impossible. And I had to remove the toilet tank (the toilet&#8217;s going in favour of a high-efficiency model, anyway) just to get the drawers out, which allowed me to get the cabinet out.<br />
After I got the cabinet out, I found three things.<br />
First, the shape of the original countertop that had once been there, which was notched out of the wall on one side. Second, the guys who had renovated the ensuite and replaced the original countertop (and cabinet) with something &#8220;nicer&#8221; had effectively torn open the wall around the drain and water supply lines to &#8230; well, I&#8217;m not sure what they did, but it&#8217;s left a big-ass hole that&#8217;s way past patching &#8212; we&#8217;re going to have to cut out and replace parts of the wall. And third, the original linoleum was preserved under the tiles (that are also used in our entrance). You&#8217;ve seen parquet flooring, yes? Well, this clearly was meant to invoke the feeling of a parquet floor, without actually BEING a parquet floor. It&#8217;s rather hideous, sort of like how an anglerfish (google it) is hideous.<br />
Then we, for all intents and purposes, moved to the temporary house. This was actually our renovator&#8217;s idea. He has a house in the same neighbourhood (conveninently) that he hadn&#8217;t rented, and offered it for use for the cost of utilities. Bonus: he can wreak havoc in our house without the trouble of us being there. Downside? WE HAVE TO MOVE. Have I mentioned that I hate moving??<br />
We were supposed to move last Tuesday. We had a U-Haul and everything. That&#8217;s when things went slightly sideways with timing. We moved things anyway, but then had to retract part of it for Alex&#8217;s dad (aka Grandpa), who was going to sleep in our basement. Not exactly ideal, but these are the joys with tearing your house apart.<br />
Tonight, we&#8217;re in our temporary house. It feels weird. It feels &#8230; well, wrong. I like my house. It&#8217;s home. It really is. My life is there, and not being there is actually hard. We&#8217;ll be back there, soon, I know, but until then I&#8217;m going to be feeling very out of place in this house. It&#8217;s not our house. It&#8217;s a rental, and we&#8217;re not really even renting (unless you count the fee we&#8217;re paying to make our house better, that is). It&#8217;s not my bed (though it was once Alex&#8217;s, and we did have it for quite sometime after we were married). It&#8217;s not our life. It&#8217;s &#8230; a holding pattern.<br />
The havoc begins Tuesday. Part of me can&#8217;t wait, the rest of me is terrified of things going wrong. We&#8217;ll soon see&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, about five years ago, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2007/03/buying-another-house/">we bought our current house</a>. We knew that when we moved in, we were going to make changes. Our plans were lofty, and while we didn&#8217;t hold true to all of them (the tankless hot water wasn&#8217;t much of an option at the time), we did succeed in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2108146297/in/set-72157603441676917">totally tearing out</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2566206074/in/set-72157603441676917">rebuilding the basement</a> &#8212; the single biggest thing to start with.<br />
Then we moved to Costa Rica for a year and a half. When we got back &#8230; well, we started to notice a couple of things. First, this house was okay, but once you&#8217;ve got a very active person (or two) under your foot, you need a bit more ease at knowing what they&#8217;re up to, and having walls that obscure the view can be a problem.<br />
And second, the kitchen was just plain uuuuuugly.<br />
<span id="more-2996"></span>The dreams started almost immediately. And the biggest first change was the ceiling. We originally had what was called a &#8220;Florida&#8221; ceiling &#8212; a<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2105105085/in/set-72157603440966341"> dropped ceiling filled with fluorescent lights</a>. It was hideous. It made me feel like I was in a tanning salon (which, I should note, I&#8217;ve never been in) the entire time I was in the kitchen. Drove me bonkers. So, finally, we (and that is to say, I) tore it out.<br />
<a href='http://www.sowrey.org/2012/03/upstairs-reno-the-fun-begins/new-kitchen-lighting/' title='New kitchen lighting'><img width="300" height="225" src="https://new.sowrey.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/04/New-kitchen-lighting-300x225.jpg" class="attachment-medium alignnone wp-image-3301" alt="New kitchen lighting" /></a>Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/5088087211/">Geoff S.</a><br />
This was a good first start &#8230; but it really didn&#8217;t satisfy the need to take a sledgehammer to most of the countertops (ugly), the drawers (too small), the corner cabinet (annoying) and the upper cabinets (either too inconvenient, or otherwise mostly useless). There wasn&#8217;t enough counter space (the fact that we&#8217;re constantly cluttering it is another problem), the dishwasher wasn&#8217;t next to the sink (which ergonomically is one thing, but the fact that it means there&#8217;s 10 feet of hose coiled up under the floor worries me, too), and frankly it&#8217;s just not that attractive.<br />
So after a couple of false starts with other contractors, we found a guy who not only knows the houses in our area really well, he lives here, too. Seemed like a perfect option. And so we began to think about our dreams and ideas.<br />
We started off with a fairly basic idea: open up the space between the kitchen and the living room. (I wanted to move the kitchen into where the living room is now, but I lost that fight.) Soon it was new counters, and new cabinets, and new fridge (arrived just a couple of days ago, much to The Brick&#8217;s relief after it sat in their warehouse for over four months), new lighting, new floors &#8230; the list goes on and on. (It also includes a new vanity for our main bathroom, which is fairly atrocious not only aesthetically, but also functionally &#8230; that and there&#8217;s a rather large crack in the countertop.) Also, vanity in our ensuite removed (replaced with the pedestal from downstairs, which was removed for another vanity).<br />
Needless to say, the changes occurring here in the next couple of weeks are so &#8230; well, &#8220;dramatic&#8221; is about the best word to describe it, for several reasons, that we&#8217;re actually going to camp out at another house nearby just so we can actually have a kitchen and, y&#8217;know, eat periodically. But we&#8217;re not moving per se &#8212; all of our furniture is still here, so it&#8217;s going to be a bit of a camping trip, just indoors. Should make for an interesting experience.<br />
We&#8217;ve already hit a couple of delays, which is mildly ironic given that the contractor we&#8217;re dealing with not only prides himself on time, but has repeatedly reinforced the need to have things locked down before he schedules anything. That was supposed to happen this week, on Thursday morning. So on Tuesday evening, we planned to move over a couple of the sofa bed mattresses, and some food. For that, I acquired a U-Haul truck&#8230;<br />
&#8230;and 20 minutes after I get to our house, we found out about the first delay. A few revisions of our kitchen plan ago, we&#8217;d noticed that two parallel walls, each of equal length, had vastly different measurements in the plans. We&#8217;d called this out not only to our contractor (&#8220;don&#8217;t worry, they cabinet makers will measure properly before they start&#8221;) and the cabinet builders (&#8220;don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll measure properly before we start&#8221;), but somehow, after they&#8217;d measured properly, the deviance was so wide that it set them back. Our contractor apparently told them that they&#8217;d have to make up the difference, but then one of the cabinet maker&#8217;s suppliers couldn&#8217;t make the deadline because some things got resized as a result &#8230; and we&#8217;re behind schedule.<br />
I suppose that wouldn&#8217;t matter so much if we&#8217;d had a complete kitchen. But ours is mostly empty, and by noon tomorrow, there will be no cabinets, the stove will be disconnected, as will likely the fridge. Tomorrow, we start camping. There&#8217;s no reason to push it off any longer.<br />
But the reno shouldn&#8217;t take more than about three weeks, assuming the contractor keeps to his mantra of scheduling (and yes, I know damn well that contractors and schedules go together like rosemary and the planet Pluto &#8212; remember, I&#8217;m in the service biz, and scheduling is something I know <em>very</em>  well, and the contractor seems genuine about it). Still, a challenge it shall be.<br />
So stay tuned. Updates will be coming, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/sets/72157603441676917/">pictures will appear in my Flickr set</a>.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, it wasn&#8217;t just Alex. Truth is, our &#8220;Florida Ceiling&#8221; bothered me from the moment we bought the house. In our original walk-around, it was one of the things I noted as needing &#8220;urgent replacement&#8221;. I personally found it rather hideous, and cast so much light into the kitchen as to be a little overwhelming.<br />

I&#8217;d hoped today&#8217;s job would go reasonably quickly. After all, I don&#8217;t want to spend the entire day tearing things apart (although it is terrible fun) and putting in new things (admittedly, rarely ever as much fun), when I could be &#8230; well, doing other things.<br />
But I digress&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-2783"></span>As you might have read, on Monday past, Alex and I had bought lights for the kitchen. Installing them wasn&#8217;t straight-forward, mostly because the Florida ceiling had to first come down. After our weekly visit to the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market, I got down to the job of destruction.<br />
I like destruction. It&#8217;s &#8230; cathartic.<br />
Taking down the Florida ceiling revealed a few things. First, the diffusers that made up most of the ceiling actually blocked a fair amount of light (we&#8217;d taken them down last weekend, mostly to see what kind of mess we were getting into, and it almost felt like we were getting a tan when the lights were on). Second, the lights had been manufactured in 1982, which likely meant the ceiling went in about the same time. Third, the guys who installed the ceiling cut a number of corners to get it done (wiring exposed, no proper wire clamps). And finally, my personal favourite, they used the ceiling to cover the fact that they hadn&#8217;t bothered to paint over the original ceiling colour (a teal, since you asked).<br />

The Florida ceiling had four basic parts: the wood lattice frame (by far the most attractive and well-built part of the ceiling), the diffusers, the light fixtures (15 double-tube fluorescent lights), and a whack of wooden strapping to give a place for the lights to be held to the ceiling. The lattice came down not too badly, the lights in an huge bunch, and the strapping with a crowbar.<br />
[flickr]photo:5088081409[/flickr] [flickr]photo:5088680822[/flickr] [flickr]photo:5088682286[/flickr]<br />
By 14:00, the kitchen was a mess. It was another hour before it was in a state for the next step &#8212; hanging the new light. The new light is a combo pot light/pot rack. Pulling the new light out of its box, it was clear I needed to make another trip to Rona &#8212; I needed an octagon box, and a pair of heavy-duty hooks to hold the rack.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; shouldn&#8217;t the rack have come with the hardware to actually hang? Well, kind of. The &#8220;hardware&#8221; they provided was a reinforced mounting plate that would hook into a normal octagon box (though the manufacturers also recommend you reinforce the octagon box), and then hang from that point. My issue is that we wanted to actually put the pot rack to use &#8212; awfully darn hard to use it when it&#8217;s not well-secured.<br />
Shortly after 16:00, the hooks were starting to go into the ceiling. #6 gauge, 5/16&#8243; threading, and about 4&#8243; long. More than enough to hold up this wee beastie, I thought. Sure enough, a test hang proved that the mounting was good. Next came a hole cut into the ceiling to install the octagon box. That&#8217;s when we had the next big surprise&#8230;<br />
Wood chips. Actually, wood shavings. Insulation. Old stuff. I&#8217;d never seen insulation like that before. It poured out of the hole, and all over the island, and into the sink. Thankfully, I saw pink fibreglass insulation above it, so I wasn&#8217;t as worried. Soon the box was in, and there was only one thing left to do &#8212; have a fibreglass bath.<br />
I&#8217;d crawled around in the attic in the house I grew up in a few times, following my dad up into the space to do a number of different things. So going up into our attic didn&#8217;t really worry me. I found very quickly that, unlike my childhood home, I couldn&#8217;t walk (crouched) in our attic &#8212; I had to crawl. And I barely fit under the wooden struts. There&#8217;s not a lot of room in that attic.<br />
I found the wires I&#8217;d pushed up from the kitchen, and spliced on new wiring for the pot lights. I also threaded new wiring to three repurposed fluorescent lights that now rested on top of the cabinets, to provide some general lighting from above (the potlights are directed onto the island &#8212; there&#8217;s not a lot of spillage). Even with a mask, long sleeves, heavy jeans, and a tucked shirt, I felt horrible the entire time. (A hot shower helped, but I still feel itchy.)<br />
I took an hour break, having dinner and watching Ice Age with the family (it&#8217;s movie night), resuming once the kids were in bed. The hookup went well, and soon the potlights were lit. About thirty minutes later, the above-cabinet lights were working, too.<br />

The kitchen now looks and feels a lot better. I think a lot of that is because the ceiling has been raised, and the extra space makes the kitchen feel more open. I also far prefer the indirect lighting that isn&#8217;t nearly as bright as it was (I&#8217;m dead certain our power bill should drop as a result). The ceiling, sadly, looks like crap now, but we&#8217;re going to hire someone to put in a knock-down ceiling to match the one in the dining room.<br />
Another step down&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve done anything significant to the house. The last time, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/category/renovations/">we gutted and rebuilt the basement</a>, a much-needed effort. It is now the most comfortable and pleasant part of the house (except maybe the utility room, which is in need of some shelving, and maybe some spackle, tape, paint, a ceiling&#8230;). That leaves the upstairs as &#8230; well, as needing some &#8220;love&#8221;. And by &#8220;love&#8221;, I mean a few walls removed, rooms rearranged, bathroom(s) redone, and a much better light transfer.<br />
But that&#8217;s a long time away. We&#8217;re talking a major improvement, which we can&#8217;t afford right now. So we&#8217;re going to start with the room that bothers Alex and I most &#8212; the kitchen. It&#8217;s too small, dark, and frankly doesn&#8217;t work well for us. (That, and I&#8217;m constantly comparing to our home in Garrison Woods, which had a kitchen that I loved.) As the saying goes, you gotta start somewhere.<br />
So I threw out the sink.<br />
<span id="more-2771"></span>The old sink bothered us. It was a yellowing, easily-stained double sink made of porcelain (so I discovered when I lobbed the piece of junk into the backyard) that we constantly struggled with. It was never quite big enough, and we were always cleaning it &#8212; ALWAYS. Just not attractive. The faucet was total garbage and needed to be replaced anyway. It was high on our list of &#8220;must do&#8221; items.<br />
[flickr]photo:5075734712[/flickr] [flickr]photo:5075137537[/flickr]<br />
It was also one of the ones I could start on first. The lighting is also quite doable, though the Florida ceiling will require most (if not all of) an entire day to rip out and replace. The sink, at least, I could do in an evening, if I had all the right parts. That was part of our first trip out to the Rona yesterday morning.<br />
The trip, sadly, quickly exposed all the things we hadn&#8217;t completely thought through yet. The only thing we walked out with was a suspended pot rack with built-in lights (destined to hang over the sink island, and get our pots out of the all-too-small drawers). Frustrated, we sat down to figure out the next steps.<br />
That led me on my next trip to the Home Depot over at Chinook. (As much as I would prefer to buy at Rona, being Canadian and all, the one in Westhills is just too darn small and lacks the selection.) Acquired: one light for the dining room to replace the ugly-as-sin fan + light fixture, one three-bulb directional light originally intended for the kitchen (but will be likely deployed in our bedroom to remove the even-uglier-as-sin chandelier), one double-sink that measured to the same dimensions as the existing sink, one new faucet, several pieces of PVC piping and connectors, and some PVC cement.<br />
Installation waited until after the kids when to bed. As much as I would love to show Monkey what I was doing, she&#8217;d have constantly been underfoot, and likely playing with the insanely sharp things I had laid about to get everything into place.<br />
I started at 20:00 (by coincidence, I assure you) by first verifying that I had a sink that would fit. (I didn&#8217;t want to be in the position of having removed the old sink only to find the new one didn&#8217;t fit.) Then I cut the piping from the sink, removed the garburator (which we didn&#8217;t want), and had to turn the water off to the entire house (for some reason, the cold tap under the sink sprays when turned off). Total removal time: 45 minutes.<br />
[flickr]photo:5075138939[/flickr]<br />
I figured I could do the new install in just over an hour. Sadly, having never installed a sink before, I grossly underestimated the trickiness of the project. Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not fully looking into one of the boxes to find the screw clamp that kept the drain fitting attached to the sink (basically, me = idiot)</li>
<li>Learning as I went about how to properly centre the new sink so the seals were in place, and so that I could properly clamp the sink to the countertop</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter was the part where I was actually fairly proud of my ingenuity. The front of the sink was too far away from the countertop to use any of the clamps (even if I angled it, the clamp just missed the edge). But I needed to clamp the front of the sink, no matter what. What I needed was a bar to clamp to&#8230;<br />
This is one of those <em>extremely</em> rare situations when men get to pride themselves on not throwing away the things (included tools, nuts and bolts, plastic ties, squeaky toys, etc.) that get thrown into the installation kits for appliances or IKEA furniture sets, and having a set of tools that mostly don&#8217;t get used. In my case, it was two short (about 4&#8243;) punched-metal double-ended wrenches (be damned if I can remember from where), my electric drill/screwdriver, and some deck screws (left over from the fence I built earlier in the summer).<br />
It was a total MacGuyver moment. (My dad, despite never watching the show, called me &#8220;MacGuyver&#8221;. But that&#8217;s another story.) I slipped the wrenches between the counter top and the flimsy piece of particleboard that made up the counter frame, and screwed them together on either side of the wrench. To look at it, you&#8217;d almost have to call &#8220;fate&#8221; &#8212; there was never a more perfect fit.<br />
Well, once I&#8217;d repositioned the sink ten bloody times, anyway&#8230;<br />
Next up, the piping. Thankfully, having a) helped my dad a few times, and b) having watched more than my share of home improvement shows, I knew the basic process to installing PVC piping: dry assemble, and then glue. The trick? I have somehow lost my ultra-awesome pipe cutter. I know I had one, but I haven&#8217;t a clue what happened to it. So I had to cut the PVC with my drywall saw. (Hey, it worked.)<br />
Eight cut pieces of PVC, two sanitary tees, one elbow, and a new trap later, I had the assembled pieces of the new drain. Always dry-fit first, folks &#8212; that way you can be sure everything gets together. (I had to trim one piece a bit &#8212; something I&#8217;d have totally blown had I not dry-fit tested.) Then came the tricky part &#8212; cementing it in place.<br />
I don&#8217;t like PVC cement. Aside from the stink, you have to move quickly. It&#8217;s sort of building a LEGO model, then taking it apart and having to reassemble as fast as possible, in the right order, because the bricks will fuse in a few seconds after putting them together. It&#8217;s a bit panicky.<br />
In the end, I had to pull pieces together tightly. Somewhere along the line, either my dry fit didn&#8217;t seat entirely, or I didn&#8217;t pull/push hard enough with the cement. I&#8217;m not really sure which. So it&#8217;s not perfect (there&#8217;s a slight push to one side), but it fits, and as of this morning, tested to be watertight.<br />
[flickr]photo:5075738800[/flickr] [flickr]photo:5075740490[/flickr]<br />
Total time, start to finish: 3 hours, 45 minutes (counting the testing this morning). About an hour of that was getting the sink straight in the first place.<br />
That concludes Phase 1 of the kitchen renovation. Phase 2 will likely be the Florida ceiling tear-down, and the light install (and likely in two parts, since I can do the dining table light pretty easily).</p>
