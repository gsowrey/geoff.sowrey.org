										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve wandered a lot through Moscow, and I never did get around to talking about it due to all the bitching I was doing. So&#8230; We took Train #1 to Moscow, did a walk around the Kremlin, saw the Armoury museum (snore), walked through GUM, and revelled in the &#8220;marvel&#8221; that is our hotel. When not being watched by the hundreds of security guards, that is&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-531"></span>The GUM department store used to be a haven for long lines for toilet paper. Now it&#8217;s a haven for corporate America:<br />

Our hotel in Moscow, the Rossiya, was both good and not so good. Here&#8217;s the courtyard. Hopefully, the dilapidated condition shows through:<br />

					<description><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with Amy. Moscow is dismal. Even when it&#8217;s sunny, it&#8217;s dismal. There is just no joy or life in this city. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a result of decades of Soviet rule, but I can&#8217;t wait to get out of here.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wholeheartedly agree with Amy.<br />
Moscow is dismal. Even when it&#8217;s sunny, it&#8217;s dismal. There is just no joy or life in this city. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a result of decades of Soviet rule, but I can&#8217;t wait to get out of here. I suppose the plethora of security personnel doesn&#8217;t help, either.<br />
<span id="more-530"></span>Amy and I escaped to the <a href="http://www.musobl.divo.ru/archit_e.html">monastery at Sergei Posad</a>, a small town about 90 minutes east of Moscow. It was a great chance to escape to something a little more sane. The monastery is an operating one &#8212; and has been that way since it was first founded. Even Stalin didn&#8217;t touch it (and he was famous for destroying churches just for the fun of it).<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03557.JPG" alt="The monastery at Sergei Posad (formerly Zagorsk)" width="300" /></a><br />
It looked almost the same as it had in 1989, though some of the buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. (Apparently, prayer is more important than keeping a roof over one&#8217;s head.) Unlike many of the other places we&#8217;ve been, though, the only fee at the monastery is to allow you to take photos or use a video camera (a common fee, mind you &#8212; a lot of places have it). A lot of people were there &#8212; a single ruble from each of them would go a long way to ensuring the funding of the monastery.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03558.JPG" alt="Me in front of the monastery at Sergei Posad (formerly Zagorsk)" width="300" /></a><br />
There&#8217;s a McDonald&#8217;s in Sergei Posad, now, about 250 metres from the monastery. There&#8217;s just something wrong about that.<br />
The tourist-only Berioska Shop that was on the outskirts of the plaza is gone, replaced with a series of small stores and a restaurant. The building is ringed by local vendors hawking their local wares (though I suspect a number of them are made in China).<br />
The food, as Amy has pointed out, has generally been quite good. Although Russian cuisine isn&#8217;t quite as &#8220;neat&#8221; as North American. You have to be careful eating chicken &#8212; they don&#8217;t debone it, here. Georgian cuisine is very tasty, although spicy, and a little bit greasy.<br />
We leave in about five hours, and it can&#8217;t go fast enough. I want out of here. I want to get on the road. I want to get past Moscow and into areas I don&#8217;t know. I want to head in the direction of home. Amy and I are homesick (Amy&#8217;s also actually sick, and I really hope I don&#8217;t catch her cold), so the sooner we get moving, the better.<br />
Tomorrow morning, we&#8217;ll be in Kazan. There for the day, then off to Ekaterinburg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hard. Really hard.<br />
Amy and I got here yesterday morning, but you&#8217;d be surprised how hard it is to find an internet cafe. Our hotel, Rossiya, despite being the largest hotel in Europe (which, incidentally, isn&#8217;t remotely as cool as it sounds), doesn&#8217;t have jack sqwat.<br />
<span id="more-529"></span>Tonight, roaming around Arbat Street, we got lucky.<br />
Why is it so hard? Security in Moscow is tight &#8212; insanely so. There&#8217;s a massive 24-hour cafe not too far from our hotel, but right in the middle of the two-block-plus radius they&#8217;ve locked down. Unless you&#8217;re in the security force or the military, you ain&#8217;t getting anywhere near Red Square.<br />
Why the big hullaballoo? The 60th anniversary of Victory Day is tomorrow, and the world has taken notice. (Why, we don&#8217;t know.) We even saw a bus dedicated to the Indian media here to cover the stories. It&#8217;s wild. Red Square: locked down. GUM: locked out (at least today, we got in yesterday). Kremlin: forget it. Even the Bolshoi is out for the count.<br />
I suppose it&#8217;s necessary. Even the Shrub (aka President of the United States of America) is hitting town for this, and without question the Russian government wants this to be a top-notch show. I think even the grass is being hand-cut for consistency.<br />
Even on Arbat Street, some distance away, there are a lot of guards. No hassling, mind you &#8212; just keeping an eyeful watch. Which is good, because I gather Moscow police have a habit of hassling tourists.<br />
Either way, Amy and I are grateful for leaving Moscow tomorrow. It&#8217;s boring here. I never particularly liked Moscow to begin with, but with everything closed, it&#8217;s even more boring than usual. We&#8217;re off for Kazan, which should be an interesting day stop before going onto Ekaterinburg.<br />
Time&#8217;s running out on this computer, though &#8212; we want to get back to the (relative) safety of our hotel, just in case security gets even tighter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890703.12</strong><br />
<em>Day 4</em><br />
We are about to leave the Zagorsk religious complex for a restaurant (I hope!) and then back to Moscow to GUM and then dinner (fish guaranteed) and then to the train. No-one will sleep tonight, partly because almost everyone is buying alcohol. If you haven&#8217;t already noticed, you have to be blind.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will say one thing for Moscow weather &#8230; it sucks. The only time we saw the sun while we were in Moscow was when the clouds parted very briefly while I was taking a picture of one of the churches in the Kremlin. Could it be that someone (or something) wanted the picture to be, heavenly? It was raining again that morning, but like the day before, not very heavily. At least that morning Jason got up on time. We had the same routine for breakfast, but we had to eat quickly, as today was going to be busy and we had no time to waste.<br />
We rushed back to our rooms and grabbed our luggage, which we packed the night before, and took it to one of four courtesy rooms, where it would wait for us until we got back. The rooms were needed, we were lucky to get the ones we did! Then we hauled ourselves into the bus and headed for Zagorsk, about an hour to the north of Moscow.<br />
This was when our walkmans came in handy. As I said, it was a crappy morning and there sure as hell wasn&#8217;t anything to take pictures of along the way. They don&#8217;t grow as much food as the could out there. If it hadn&#8217;t been for Stalin taking control of farms and centralizing them, the Soviet Union could be on par with North America, instead of being the Second World country it is.<br />
When we arrived at the Zagorsk complex, it was still raining, only a little harder than in Moscow. We unloaded once more and took some time to look around. Then, after some pictures of the outer wall (yes, this too was a kind of kremlin), we went inside.<br />
The churches there were all still fully functional, unlike those in the Kremlin in Moscow. The main courtyard was the hub of the whole complex, the parts that we saw anyway, and from it, you could access all the churches. Here we also found a fountain that poured out water, which I think the priests considered to be Holy. Konrad tried some, but nothing happened to him (at least, he didn&#8217;t seem to change his ways &#8212; if anything, he got worse).<br />
We were then taken into a church that stood in front of the fountain. This was another Cathedral of the Assumption. This was just as impressive as the one in Moscow, although there were a few subtle differences, such as it was operational &#8230; and packed! There were people everywhere, every one of them devoutly religious. It almost made me a believer. Perhaps the eeriest part of that tour was when they started to sing. In the small church, it seemed almost hypnotic. The sound seemed to come from every direction at once.<br />
A few of us decided to make a quiet exit as we wanted to get outside, where it was cooler and we could get some fresh air. As we exited, we saw a woman standing at the door with a baby. The baby did not move at all. The woman looked like she was looking for help from the priests.<br />
A small group of Pete, Derek, Toni and myself checked out another church, the oldest in Zagorsk. Although the outside was much simpler, the inside was very similar to the others we had already seen, except that most of the paintings had been blackened with soot from over the years. We regrouped back out in the courtyard and began to chat about what had occurred so far. Pete left for a moment to take pictures for a teacher back at our school (Pete and myself&#8217;s), Mr. Dunn. During that time, Derek began to crack dead baby jokes. Why? Because the woman was still at the door. Mind you, the baby wasn&#8217;t dead, it was just asleep.<br />
We ran into Marina and she showed us a few other things in the monastery, including the former residence of the Romanov family. We also happened to see a monk that had a very familiar appearance. At first I couldn&#8217;t place it, but then it hit me &#8230; Rasputin! Who knows? Maybe they didn&#8217;t kill him after all.<br />
Before we returned to our buses, our guides and KB suggested that we check out the BS store first, as we might want to pick up something to drink during the train trip that night. The store was much smaller than the one in Moscow but it had a large alcohol section. There were only a handful of people who did not get booze (one of whom was me). That was KB&#8217;s first big mistake.<br />
We hopped on the bus and headed over to a restaurant less than five minutes away. There we had an awesome lunch that was very reminiscent of the one we had the day before. Soup, beef and diddlydo do do do do do do do do &#8230; ICE CREAM! After lunch we went outside and traded with the locals. It was now that I started into pins, and got rid of a lot of the gum that I brought with me. We also managed to teach the local children how to perform the North American obscenity known as &#8220;The Finger&#8221;, only we showed them the forefinger instead of the third. About half an hour later, we were headed back towards Moscow.<br />
As we had already eaten lunch, we went directly downtown from Zagorsk to Red Square. It was here that we moved as fast as we could. We got pictures of St. Basil&#8217;s Cathedral and Red Square the day before so the only thing we had left to look at was GUM, the state department store. That place was obscenely huge! For those of you who have been to the Eaton Centre in Toronto, just picture three Great Halls sidebyside.<br />
Greg and Lisa V wanted to do some serious power shopping and Jason and I thought we would try and tag along. The key word is &#8220;try&#8221;. As soon as we got in there, we found ourselves literally running just to keep up. We gave up after about five minutes and decided just to check around ourselves. After a while, we ran into Pete, Toni and Derek who were doing their own tour. It was then we found out that Toni doesn&#8217;t like heights. We found this out when Pete and Jason leaned over the rails to view the floor fifteen feet below. She panicked every time they leaned over.<br />
We finally found the queues that we had been told about. Some stores were packed. The watch store was jammed and stock was very low. There was also a very long line full of people waiting to get into the store that sold, of all things, toilet paper, soap and perfumes. It was times like that I was glad to be a Westerner.<br />
Soon, our half hour was up and we had to go back to our bus. We had an early dinner in store for us, we had to catch a train for Kiev that night. But our bus was a bit late leaving the downtown core as trading hit a frenzy for about ten minutes. We knew what as for dinner, no-one needed to tell us, so we weren&#8217;t in a rush. Fish was waiting as we had expected. But there was a little twist &#8230; caviar! Before I had left, I had made a promise to try everything that was placed before me. I&#8217;m a fussy eater, which as George Carlin puts it, is a euphemism for &#8220;Big pain in the ass!&#8221; But it was a new country and I wanted to experience it.<br />
I swear, rich people are demented. Caviar is disgusting. Very salty, mushy and extremely fishy. Fortunately, there was a lot of bread and water to wash the taste out. But other than that, dinner followed the pattern that we had started two nights before. The food, incidentally, finally got to someone that night. Toni left the dining room having not eaten a thing, and it concerned a few of us. Given, the food was pretty raunchy, but we had to eat something. We found her outside, not feeling up to snuff. Pete stayed with her and the rest of us just left her alone.<br />
We collected our bags from the courtesy rooms and piled them outside, so the porters could put them in the lower compartments on the bus. The next thing on the bus was us. Then we took our last trip into Moscow. We got to the train station, but weren&#8217;t let off the bus. Our guides had to track down our tickets. So we sat around, wondering what the hell was going to happen that night. Little did we know &#8230;</p>
