								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, you know <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/microsoft/">my opinions on Microsoft</a>. They&#8217;re not exactly private. So yes, I definitely went into yesterday&#8217;s announcement with low expectations.<br />
Microsoft has really only done one thing really well in the last decade, in my opinion: Xbox. That was a helluva gamble &#8212; I was in the gaming industry still when the first rumours surfaced &#8212; and Microsoft could have gone down hard. But the gamble paid off &#8212; they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie">invested heavily in content</a>, and (in the end) content helped win their position in the video game battlefield.<br />
But on their software end &#8212; their traditional business &#8212; it&#8217;s a very different story. It&#8217;s been a long wait for something &#8220;better&#8221;. Windows XP has been around for a decade; it finally goes away in 2014. Windows Vista was an utter mess. Windows 7 appears to be decent, but the adoption seems to be more about having to leave XP than &#8220;oh, this is so much better than X&#8221;. Windows 8? Haven&#8217;t played with it yet, admittedly, but I just don&#8217;t hear the buzz about it. Office is an ancient standby that&#8217;s in need of a serious overhaul (really, a <em>word processor</em> shouldn&#8217;t occupy so much RAM). Internet Information Server (IIS) is so overcomplicated as to make me wonder if someone wrote it on a dare. Don&#8217;t even get me started on IE.<br />
Microsoft has rested on its corporate laurels for most of its life, continuing along without any real serious change. (Debate me, please! I would love to be proven wrong, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m right.) We&#8217;ve not seen anything truly <em>new</em>.<br />
That includes the Microsoft Surface tablet. It&#8217;s a mobile device that runs Windows. It&#8217;s been done before &#8212; the Microsoft phones, for example. (Windows RT, CE, 8, etc. It&#8217;s still Windows, regardless of the flavour.) They&#8217;ve not exactly taken off with the popularity of the iPhone or Android-based phones. The platform seems solid, but the overall environment (media integration, for example) is absent.<br />
The tablet itself is &#8230; well, just another tablet. There was <em>not one innovative</em><em> thing</em> announced yesterday. Oh, the keyboard? That&#8217;s not part of the tablet &#8212; that&#8217;s an <em>accessory</em>, and <a href="http://hatchnco.com/">it&#8217;s already been done</a>. It&#8217;s a smarter implementation, yes, but nothing truly new. The Surface tablet, in fact, reminds me much more of the RIM Playbook than anything else &#8212; too complicated to be a simple device, which is what makes the iPad so brilliant.<br />
And this morning, I realised the other thing Microsoft has failed upon &#8212; releasing it. They&#8217;re taunting people with the next-nearest thing to vapourware: an unfinished product. It was so bad at the launch yesterday, that <a href="https://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/214888904120205314">demo devices were snatched away before anyone could get any significant details</a> on them. By comparison, Apple &#8212; the very company Microsoft is attempting to emulate, here &#8212; announces hardware by saying you can buy it <em>today</em>. There&#8217;s a lot to be said for immediacy. Microsoft&#8217;s announcement was the marketing equivalent of premature ejaculation.<br />
Okay, now in Microsoft&#8217;s defence &#8212; because, yes, I do see where they&#8217;re coming from. Although Microsoft has never released a real computer of its own (they&#8217;ve done some excellent peripherals; my favourite keyboard next to the original heavy-click IBM PC keyboard was a Microsoft split keyboard), they have heavily influenced PC manufacturers for years. But that influence has &#8230; well &#8230; if you&#8217;ve gone around and looked at the recent PCs, you really have to wonder if anyone has thought outside the beige box. PC designs have changed little, and, frankly, they just ain&#8217;t sexy. They&#8217;re even more boring now than the old towers of old.<br />
So this is Microsoft telling all their vendors that &#8220;enough is enough&#8221; &#8212; if you&#8217;re going to do something right, do it yourself. So kudos to Microsoft to stepping up to that plate, and driving it hard. This is where Microsoft could potentially change the game again &#8212; as they did with the Xbox (yes, pun intended) &#8212; and revitalise an industry that is sagging like &#8230; um &#8230; see my above comment about &#8220;premature&#8221; and draw your own conclusion.<br />
As for <em>my</em> conclusion on the Surface &#8212; it changes nothing at this point. The announcement was too early, the environment undefined, and until someone antes up with a real-world demo of how awesome everything together can be, I&#8217;ll remain wanting.<br />
Wanting Microsoft to be awesome again. I&#8217;ve been waiting a long time.<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I&#8217;m getting a little tired of this topic.</strong> I was tired of it about a day after Steve Jobs first showed the iPad to the world, and the <a href="http://www.thebluelego.com/">infamous blue LEGO</a> appeared where a Flash plug-in should have been. It wasn&#8217;t really so much a shock to the world &#8212; Apple had been denying Flash applications on their iPod/iPhone platform all along. But this seemed to start off a little maelstrom the likes of which I haven&#8217;t read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">since people argued over on which end to start eating a hard-boiled egg</a>.<br />
The events of the last few weeks have been extremely tiresome to say the least. Far too many people and groups have been  prognosticating  the future of personal computing, and <strong>there&#8217;s been far too little in doses of reality</strong>. The future is coming, but it&#8217;s not coming nearly as quickly as everyone thinks it is, and rushing to meet the future will likely only harm the present. A little rational thought would be appreciated.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s address the elephant in the room, first. <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/why-steve-jobs-hates-flash.html"><strong>Steve Jobs hates Flash.</strong></a> There, I&#8217;ve said it. Now let&#8217;s move on.<br />
<span id="more-2644"></span>I&#8217;m not here to argue about openness or stability, or any of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/">claims</a>/<a href="http://jessewarden.com/2010/04/steve-jobs-on-flash-correcting-the-lies.html">counter-claims</a> made by anyone. There&#8217;s no point, since a large part of it is highly subjective. <strong>Apple will do whatever Apple wants to do</strong>, regardless of any other company&#8217;s desires, intentions, or abilities. And while Apple might be on the right path to the next major shift in personal computing, we&#8217;re still quite some time from critical mass.<br />
Right now, in the industry, <strong>we have a need for rich, engaging experiences</strong>. These experiences are the things that help capture attention and keep people using a website or service long enough for that website or service to deliver its message and achieve its function. It could be easily argued that a much simpler user interface can do the same thing, but I can also easily argue that <strong>there is a wide gulf between utility and ubiquity</strong>: I love the simpleness that comes with pure utility, but the ubiquity of &#8220;fun&#8221; is what wins the day.<br />
As a result of Apple, a lot of people are starting to tout the death of Adobe (formerly Macromedia) Flash. It&#8217;s doomed because Apple said so, or at least that&#8217;s the narrowly simple version of the story. A longer version introduces the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">up-and-coming HTML5 standards</a>, which start to <strong>blur the lines between what Flash does now and what could be done without Flash</strong>. That&#8217;s what a lot of the major players (<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/195362/google_official_reaffirms_html5_readiness.html">Google</a> and Apple being the two most obvious) are moving towards, and there&#8217;s no reason why their direction shouldn&#8217;t be taken as the final chapter on Flash, right?<br />
Right?<br />
To the best of my knowledge and five minutes on Google,  <strong>there has never been a technology that has up-and-vanished overnight</strong> (even figuratively-speaking) merely because one company said so. While I have a significant amount of respect for Apple and their attention to detail, and I nearly worship at the Altar of Google, I&#8217;d be quite the fool to be agreeing to abandon Flash.<br />
Yes, you heard me. <strong>Dropping Flash is a foolish idea. </strong><br />
I know, I know. Don&#8217;t I hate Flash? Aren&#8217;t I the one who railed against it for years and years and years. In a word: no. <strong>I&#8217;m technology agnostic.</strong> I&#8217;ve been agnostic for a almost a decade. I learned a long time ago that ignoring a solution merely because you don&#8217;t like it immediately cuts you out of possible success, and <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2006/08/my-expectations-of-a-technology-team/">you end up reinventing wheels</a>. I don&#8217;t hate Flash &#8212; I hate inappropriate use of a technology.<br />
Flash, as a platform for providing a rich media solution, has a place in our industry. For today, tomorrow, and the foreseeable short-term future (I&#8217;m saying at least two years, personally), <strong>any company pulling support for Flash is being extremely short-sighted</strong>. It&#8217;s like ditching your extremely reliable car at the side of the road to climb into an open chassis that has no doors, no roof, the colours and interior are still being decided, the engine periodically doesn&#8217;t work properly, and you&#8217;d better hope the dang thing has brakes.<br />
Yes, <strong>you can do a lot without Flash right now</strong>. A number of websites (the <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/leaf-electric-car">site for new Nissan Leaf</a>, the <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html#slide1">HTML5 presentation</a>, <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/blowing-up-html5-video">HTML5 video</a>, <a href="http://acko.net/blog/javascript-audio-synthesis-with-html-5">HTML5 audio funkiness</a>) have proven that you can use these new standards quite effectively, and move away from Flash. And to that end, I say &#8220;congratulations, I hope you do well&#8221;. You&#8217;re going to need a lot of help, and pray that you can get away with it.<br />
Why? Well, guess what folks, the <strong>HTML5 &#8220;standard&#8221; isn&#8217;t complete</strong> &#8212; It&#8217;s still a working draft. CSS3? Not finished, and not properly/fully supported by any browser. Video? Well, as much as Apple has tried to say that H.264 is the de facto standard, it&#8217;s patented, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Patent_licensing">license fees will kick in at the end of 2015</a>. Google&#8217;s bought On2, with the widely-held <a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/04/google-planning-to-open-the-vp8-video-codec.ars">hope that they&#8217;ll release the VP8 codec openly</a>. <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Mozilla-defends-Firefox-s-HTML5-support-for-only-Ogg-Theora-video-912003.html">Firefox is only supporting Ogg Theora.</a> And lest we forget the Browser That Just Won&#8217;t Die: <strong>Internet Explorer 6 will make your life a living hell</strong>.<br />
<strong>Anyone remember the standards fights from the late 1990s?</strong> Does any of this look at all familiar?<br />
Okay, so let&#8217;s assume that you can develop to some standards. How many authoring tools are you going to need? How many libraries? There&#8217;s <strong>no one consistent authoring tool</strong>, and your developers are going to need some seriously good (and seriously expensive) skills to make it all blend together smoothly.<br />
Now let&#8217;s add in the <strong>added complication of rights management</strong>. Try find that little detail in the HTML5 specs. Go on, take a look, I&#8217;ll wait. Didn&#8217;t see anything? That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not there. Big Media (read: Dinosaur Media) needs this in their vain attempt to keep their archaic business models creaking forward. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5461711/giz-explains-why-html5-isnt-going-to-save-the-internet">They need DRM.</a> They need  encryption. They need the stuff built into Flash to keep their delivery systems operating. If for that reason alone, Flash has a long life ahead of it.<br />
I&#8217;m not dancing around here with rose-coloured glasses. <strong>Flash is dying, of that I have no doubts.</strong> As a plug-in solution, its days are numbered. More than likely, it&#8217;ll morph into a development system not unlike Microsoft Studio, where it will be a rich media solution system. What it generates as a final product will depend on the need, supporting different outputs is definitely a possibility.<br />
<strong>But for now, I&#8217;m sticking with Flash.</strong> It&#8217;s helpful, it&#8217;s handy, and it works.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the moment, <strong>IE6 still holds about 20% of the market</strong> (<a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2">according to today&#8217;s metrics from NetMarketShare</a>). That&#8217;s far too large a share for a 8.5 year old browser, especially one that has been  superseded  by successive releases of its own code by two versions. It&#8217;s far too much for a browser that costs too much to support, and despite several service packs still bears significant security issues. It continues to haunt the internet, acting like a lazy bouncer allowing the seediest of activities to go on unchecked.<br />
I propose <strong>April 1st be &#8220;IE6 Dies&#8221; Day</strong>.  It&#8217;s time that IE6 be shown the door. But we&#8217;ll need help.<br />
<span id="more-2574"></span>This isn&#8217;t the first time people have called for IE6 to go away. But previously, these were developer-led challenges, all of which met the same problem: <strong>we&#8217;re not the ones who get to make that decision</strong>. All a client needs to do is pull out a report from their stats engine to prove why they need it. (Or simply open their company-issued laptop to show the IT-mandated browser.) Going against this kind of weight, we&#8217;re lost.<br />
<strong>We need to go the other way.</strong> Not to the browser makers (they&#8217;re on our side), but to the people offering services that people want to see. Want to punish a child? Take away its access to its toys.<br />
We need to call out to the Big 3 search engines. <strong>Google, Bing, and Yahoo: Block access to IE6.</strong> And I don&#8217;t mean provide a subtle hint page, I mean block it entirely. With a big, bold page that says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;font-size: 1.5em">We&#8217;re sorry, but your browser is no longer supported. Please upgrade to one of the following [insert browser list here]. If necessary, please contact your IT department.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s already on this path. Microsoft has encouraged upgrades to IE8. Yahoo hasn&#8217;t really said anything yet, but I imagine they&#8217;ve thought something similar. Take these three pages away, and you <strong>cut off a primary tool</strong> that millions of IE6 users go to daily. With these unavailable for no reason other than a browser update, it should help drive that final spike into the heart.<br />
So why April 1? Well, there&#8217;s the obvious reason: IE6 has been &#8220;fooling&#8221; us for far too long, and it&#8217;s time that we prove that we&#8217;re not fooled any longer. But a bigger reason is time: Namely, <strong>give companies some warning</strong>. The upgrade cost can be  significant, and companies need time to get things in place. Frankly, they&#8217;ve had enough, but a sudden stop without warning can cause some pretty major headaches. (I may be a jerk, but I&#8217;m not without sympathy for IT teams, having some good friends who do IT, and having enough IT to respect the problems they solve.)<br />
I can&#8217;t do this alone. For this to work, <strong>we need as many people as possible</strong> to spread the message. Tweet/retweet this message as much as you can (please use the hashtag #ie6diesday, if possible). Send them this message:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Search Provider,<br />
Due to the on-going security and support problems with Internet Explorer 6, I would like to suggest that you consider April 1 &#8220;IE6 Dies Day&#8221;, and block IE6 from accessing your search engine. There are many other options and alternatives. http://bit.ly/bZTUej<br />
Sincerely,<br />
[Your name here]</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s some quick links to get you started!</p>

<li>Yahoo: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/indexing/webmaster-01.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/search/indexing/webmaster-01.html</a> and <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/">http://www.ysearchblog.com/</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Spread the news. Let&#8217;s convince the search engines that <strong>it&#8217;s time for IE6 to die</strong>, once and for all.</p>

Greed kills innovation.<br />
It&#8217;s short, it&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s sure to raise the ire of a lot of people, but it&#8217;s also a major problem we&#8217;re seeing lately, especially in internet technologies. It&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s dogged humanity for generations. And it&#8217;s getting worse.<br />
<span id="more-2562"></span>It&#8217;s getting worse because of the pace of technology. There was a time, roughly my current lifetime ago, when there were only a handful of companies engaged in developing technology. They made hardware, wrote the software, and generally all of them hoped things would work.   People took ideas from one another, all hoping that they could make it into a better idea. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_graphical_user_interface#Xerox_PARC">Witness how Apple and Microsoft flourished on an idea from Xerox&#8230;</a><br />
But things changed. Today, we look back on Xerox, and we think: You yutz! You should&#8217;ve sued Microsoft blind! Why? Because we all got greedy. It&#8217;s not about making things better, it&#8217;s about making money.<br />
Patents Gone Wild! See them on the streets of Silicon Valley, beating up struggling  entrepreneurs  trying to make something good. Or in the Northwest, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2006/02/reform-the-us-patent-office/">terrorising established companies for no valid reason</a>. Bringing down entire corporate communications, regardless of impact. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/01/24/1348251/Mozillas-VP-of-Engineering-On-H264">Not being able to display a video because the cost is too high. </a><br />
My problem with all of this isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s illegal &#8212; it&#8217;s not. A patent holder is allowed, by law, to defend their patent against encroachment. My problem is that it happens with increasingly dangerous frequency, often initiated by people who, frankly, have no business holding a patent.<br />
The laws in North America have bred a two-tiered system: those who patent to protect their business, and those who license patents (and quite often end up in big name lawsuits). I know many people in the first group whose companies have pushed them to file patents, to ensure that their business is protected. And we&#8217;ve all seen the prolonged battles of the latter.<br />
I fear we&#8217;re entering an era when innovation &#8212; real innovation, not incremental one-upmanship &#8212; will become stifled. The fear of lawsuit and the yawning chasm of bureaucracy needed to protect an idea will become roadblocks. People who might have done well on their own will look at the challenges and say: No, thanks.<br />
Imagine if Steve Wozniak had said that. No, thanks, I don&#8217;t want to sell this computer kit to anyone. Or if Henry Ford had looked at his dream of consistently templated automobiles and thought: Who&#8217;s waiting around the corner with a lawyer? Page and Brin might have looked at Yahoo! and said: Y&#8217;know, what&#8217;s the point?<br />
Maybe I&#8217;m too altruistic. Maybe because I&#8217;ve grown tired at seeing the petty bickering over hundreds of millions of dollars, while reading headlines about mass suffering around the world. Maybe it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re a decade behind having a viable electric car in widespread use anywhere in the world.  Maybe I just want the frickin&#8217; jetpack we&#8217;re all supposed to be using now.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a massive upswelling of <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=ie6">support for <strong>eliminating Internet Explorer 6</strong></a> (IE6), the much-maligned former-heavyweight and former-saviour of the world that now lies as one of the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ie6+standards+support">worst pieces of web browsing software in common use</a>. It started more grass roots, but now includes such fan-favourites as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/14/AR2009071401088.html">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://blog.digg.com/?p=878">Digg</a>, and a whack of other Web 2.0 firms.<br />
The hope, particularly around the web development world, is that this upswelling will finally put nails in the coffin of IE6 and eliminate the bugger from the software world, thus heralding in <strong>a new era of (near-)web standards</strong>.<br />
There&#8217;s only one problem: <strong>Web 2.0 companies don&#8217;t mean jack</strong> to Corporate America.<br />
<span id="more-1473"></span>Here&#8217;s the sad and very-painful reality. Only about 25% of IE6 users can change. <a href="http://james.padolsey.com/general/take-a-stand-against-ie/">The remaining 75% of users &#8212; let&#8217;s say, about 10% of the entire browser market (yes, I know numbers vary wildly) &#8212; can&#8217;t.</a> Why? <strong>Because corporate IT won&#8217;t let them.</strong> And frankly, as a corporate IT person myself, I can relate. Telling them that you can&#8217;t see your favourite social networking site garners no sympathy, &#8216;cuz you&#8217;re probably not allowed to view them during work hours, anyway.<br />
The major problem with most web use in the workplace is that it&#8217;s very risky. Perhaps you haven&#8217;t noticed, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=internet+not+safe">the internet isn&#8217;t exactly a safe place</a>. Aside from the relatively-innocuous stuff like porn and spam, there&#8217;s lots ways for people to infiltrate corporate and government computers through what could be construed as regular &#8220;innocent&#8221; use. <strong>A simple download can ruin your IT team&#8217;s day.</strong> (I&#8217;ve been there enough times, I know.)<br />
Okay, for small businesses, this is less of an issue. But for Big Business &#8212; and I&#8217;m talking Fortune 50, here &#8212; this isn&#8217;t just an issue. It&#8217;s an <strong>opportunity for widespread panic</strong>.<br />
Several of my clients have requirements to support IE6. Not so much because of their customers, but because of themselves. <strong>That&#8217;s their corporate standard.</strong> That&#8217;s what they have installed on all their computers. Which, incidentally, are almost assuredly Windows XP SP2 systems under very tight administrative control. In many cases, they don&#8217;t even have Flash (or if they do, they&#8217;re at least a couple of versions behind).<br />
Why?<br />
Control. Pure and simple. Corporate IT can be run ragged even at the best of times. A single virus infection can throw an entire company into complete chaos. And when it takes down groups, or even whole departments (never mind the entire company), the <strong>amount of money lost due to halted productivity</strong> runs into the hundreds of thousands of dollars per <em>minute</em>. And with the advent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes-Oxley_Act">Sarbanes-Oxley</a>, it&#8217;s often just plain easier to lock down everything and ignore the resulting boo-hooing.<br />
If you think that upgrading IE6 is as simple as upgrading software, you haven&#8217;t accounted for the <strong>potential cost if something goes wrong</strong>.<br />
And that single &#8220;if&#8221; is why IE6 is still here. And won&#8217;t be going away quickly. It&#8217;s all fine for Web 2.0 companies to drop IE6 support (and really, should drop it), but <strong>unless something business-critical to the Fortune 50</strong> drops IE6 (and is weighty enough to force an IT change), it will remain.<br />
I don&#8217;t like it better than you do. As a developer (or more correctly, a <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/management/">development </a><em><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/management/">manager</a></em>) spending a lot of time &#8220;fixing&#8221; IE6&#8217;s web standards support (and especially PNG support) is not only wasteful, it <strong>tends to create more problems than it solves</strong>. I would love to see IE6 disappear, and eliminate a major headache. But it won&#8217;t. Not until something changes.<br />
So what needs to change?<br />
<strong>Perception of cost.</strong> Namely, what cost is larger? The cost to migrate from IE6 to a better browser (and no, I&#8217;m not going to say which one &#8212; <a href="http://browsehappy.com/browsers/">there are enough options</a>), or the cost to support IE6. And let&#8217;s keep in mind that the cost to support IE6 goes well beyond <em>initial development</em>, folks. <em>Maintenance </em>adds on heaps of cost as well, especially if design tweaks persist.<br />
Here&#8217;s a way to start approaching this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project X has a budget of <strong>$5 million</strong>. (I work in big budgets. And frankly, if you&#8217;re working with Fortune 50, you pretty much always work with big budgets.)</li>
<li>Project X has a development budget of <strong>$1 million</strong> (once you account for time to planning, designing, and revisions).</li>
<li>The <strong>price to support IE6 is nearing 25%</strong> (at least from the numbers I see). That means either losing 25% of core development to supporting IE6, or adding on additional budget. But let&#8217;s say $250,000, just for laughs.</li>
<li>That means <strong>5% of your entire original budget</strong> is now being used to support IE6. And I&#8217;d like to think of that as <em>very</em> conservative.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s just initial development. <strong>That gets you to launch.</strong> But remember folks, we like to look <em>past </em>launch. Because big budget projects generally tend to have long lives &#8212; you want to get your investment back, after all.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project X has a <strong>$2 million annual maintenance</strong> budget (again, just a rough number, but these budgets cover new campaigns, updates to existing campaigns, microsites, etc. ).</li>
<li>Development costs typically gain a larger percentage during maintenance cycles as the original high-level thinking is already done. So let&#8217;s say <strong>40% goes to development.</strong> That&#8217;s $800,000.</li>
<li>Supporting <strong>IE6 still requires as much work</strong> &#8212; that part never gets any easier. Your IE6 support cost? About $200,000. <em>Per year.</em></li>
<li>That means nearly <strong>10% of your maintenance budget</strong> goes to one browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming a four-year lifespan of Project X before it incurs another major overhaul, you&#8217;re looking at (again, example numbers) <strong>$850,000.</strong> For one browser.<br />
If you want to kill IE6, <strong>consider taking this to your client.</strong> That $850,000 could be far better spent on other items, and is &#8212; effectively &#8212; a loss to their company. Using a smaller percentage to upgrade IE6 to something else would likely allow greater flexibility by the IT department, and eliminate it as a support item.<br />
In short, <a href="http://hey-it.com/">don&#8217;t plead to the IT team</a>. That won&#8217;t get you far. <strong>Hit your client&#8217;s pocketbook</strong> instead &#8212; that&#8217;ll get the needed attention. Just make sure you use your budgetary numbers, not mine.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have come across a URL for a webpage that is (effectively) building <a href="http://fixoutlook.org/">a petition to Microsoft to correct HTML support in Outlook</a> &#8212; and if you haven&#8217;t, just click on the link. The petition&#8217;s purpose is quite simple: Please, Dear Microsoft, replace the HTML rendering present in Microsoft Outlook 2010 with something better.<br />
Microsoft, to their credit, has seen this petition and has authored their own response: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/outlook/archive/2009/06/24/the-power-of-word-in-outlook.aspx">The Power of Word in Outlook</a>.  The sad reality is that, even though written by William Kennedy,  Corporate Vice President, Office Communications and Forms Team, that  team has completely missed the point of the petition.<br />
And it raises the question: Why is Microsoft &#8212; yet again &#8212; refusing to listen to the people who know best? Not the developers of a system, but its users.<br />
<span id="more-1412"></span>Web Developers world-wide have contended with Outlook and is continually-degrading ability to render even the most compliant of HTML for emails. Given, Outlook is not alone in this criticism, as some other email clients are even worse (<a href="http://www.templatekit.com/lotusnotes1.php">listen up, Lotus Notes</a>). HTML emails have had their problems over the years, and JavaScript was (wisely) dropped by most vendors some time ago.<br />
The cries from developers are clear: Why, oh why, are we not able to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/code-html-email-newsletters/">render HTML properly</a>, and <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/">use CSS to style it</a>?<br />
Because, for some strange reason, Outlook uses the Microsoft Word engine to render its HTML. (And <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/2393/microsoft-takes-email-design-b/">why Word has an HTML renderer separate from Internet Explorer remains another question</a>.) Microsoft views this, however, as a good thing. To read their post today, they point out:<br />
However, there are a number of fallacies with their logic. Which is deeply concerning, as it strongly suggests that the Outlook development team is out of touch with the industry (odd, considering they seem to follow Twitter).<br />
There are a few points in their introductory paragraphs to which I take objection. I&#8217;ll quote them so we can address them more specifically.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Email Standards Project, which developed the website that promotes the current Twitter campaign, is backed by the maker of â€œemail marketing campaignâ€ software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the Email Standards Project might have started this effort, but they do not stand alone in the petition. There are thousands of other developers in this industry who are also asking. We&#8217;ve been asking for a long time, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>[We] believe itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the best e-mail authoring experience around, with rich tools that our Word customers have enjoyed for over 25 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, what? Seriously, do you folks have a different set of software that I&#8217;ve worked with since 1989? Again, Mr. Kennedy (and Microsoft), you&#8217;re missing the entire point: It&#8217;s not the  <em>creation</em> of the email that&#8217;s the problem. It&#8217;s the  <em>viewing</em> &#8212; the important part of the communication process. The HTML renderer in Microsoft Word is so utterly broken that it can&#8217;t even render a simple HTML email without forcing us to violate every standard we know, and write HTML that makes most professional web developers want to hide in a dark corner.<br />
But for the sake of argument, people who create HTML emails professionally do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> want to use Microsoft Word as an editor &#8212; we barely tolerate it as a tool to display our source copy decks. If you honestly &#8220;believe itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s the best e-mail authoring experience around&#8221;, you clearly have not tried to support emails on multiple email clients at once.<br />
And yes, Word has been around for 25 years. This is not necessarily a good thing. May I remind you that Microsoft Word was originally just a word processor? Then you turned it into a (seriously flawed) desktop publisher? Shoe-horning HTML editor support was a complete joke in Word 95 (even considering how bad most HTML was back then), and has barely improved since.<br />
(And you probably have 25-year old code in there, too. Maybe you should clean it up a bit?)<br />
But even those don&#8217;t hold a candle to the insipidity of the &#8220;examples&#8221; of why Word is a great HTML email editor. They offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>SmartArt</li>
<li>Drawing and Charting Tools</li>
<li>Table and Formatting Tools</li>
<li>Mini Toolbar for formatting</li>
</ul>
<p>When I read these, I just about had an apoplectic seizure. <em>SmartArt?!</em> Who the hell are you trying to kid, Mr. Kennedy? As a Corporate Vice President, you should make sure your advisers are providing accurate information about what the industry is doing, and where they&#8217;re having the most pain.<br />
We in the interactive marketing world will never use any of those features. Why? Aside from the fact that they are gawd-awfully ugly (and keep in mind this is coming from a programmer, not an artist), the use of these tools creates HTML that is incompatible with almost every non-Microsoft email client (including HotMail, I should add). Please do not get me started on the drivel that comes out to recreate a table.</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that e-mail is about interoperability among various e-mail programs, and we believe that Outlook provides a good mix of a rich user experience and solid interoperability with a wide variety of other e-mail programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last I checked, Outlook really only worked well with Exchange. (And don&#8217;t get me started on Entourage.) As a communications tool, it&#8217;s a useful program &#8212; I use it all day, every day. But it&#8217;s not a good authoring tool. Authoring is best done in other applications. And heaven forbid you developed your HTML outside of Outlook &#8212; the import and send never works. Never. We have to use something like Thunderbird to get a decent result.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no widely-recognized consensus in the industry about what subset of HTML is appropriate for use in e-mail for interoperability. <strong>The â€œEmail Standards Projectâ€ does not represent a sanctioned standard or an industry consensus in this area.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>(Their formatting, not mine.)<br />
No, it does not. <strong>But, you know, there&#8217;s this little group called the World Wide Web Consortium</strong><strong>. Remember them?</strong> No, they don&#8217;t specify a subset of HTML that is &#8220;appropriate for use in e-mail&#8221;. And that&#8217;s the point. There isn&#8217;t one, nor should there be one. You&#8217;re the dumbasses who started restricting things for no particular (or good) reason. HTML is HTML, and it should remain that way.<br />
So, please, Microsoft: Extract your head from your ass, stop looking at your face in the mirror, cease whatever self-obsessed activity you&#8217;re currently engaged in. Actually go out into the industry, do some fucking research, and start making software people actually want to use.<br />
Hint: There&#8217;s a reason Apple is doing so well right now.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not 45 minutes ago, Google released their latest contribution to the internet: <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>. This effectively ended years of speculation that Google was writing a browser, that it would throw its hat into the ring and kick off another heated browser war.  <br />
Figures that Google wouldn&#8217;t just drop a bomb, it would lay waste to the expectations of a browser. My hat is off to the <a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">Chrome development team</a> &#8212; you guys pulled off a doozy.  <br />
<span id="more-1079"></span>Google (correctly) identified that there is a significant problem with browsers today: They&#8217;re too slow. That generalisation is borne of the increasingly complicated apps that are being developed each and every day on the web. There&#8217;s so many websites out there that require extensive scripting and content richness that even the most advanced browsers sometimes chug away.  <br />
So for only-Google-knows-how-long, the Chrome team slugged away with the fundamental problems of a browser: How to deliver something quickly. Browsers were all based on the same core model of sequential loading (there have been countless presentations to that effect) and this still causes a lot of optimisation headaches for complex web apps.  <br />
Google did what most mature applications do, and turned everything into multiple processes, running them independently so they&#8217;ll execute (overall) more quickly. Add onto that the complete rewrite and virtualisation of the JavaScript engine (courtesy of V8). Finally, take some of the caching/processing out of the browser and lob it over the fence to <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> (another one of Google&#8217;s underrated little gems), and you don&#8217;t have a browser anymore. You have something worthy of using the internet.  <br />
Yes, all this high praise comes with a major caveat &#8212; I&#8217;ve only used it for about 45 minutes now. But that&#8217;s 45 minutes of trying to break it with everything that bothered me in other websites.  <br />
My personal favourite? <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a>. I love Flickr, don&#8217;t get me wrong, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey">I&#8217;ve got (currently) 6,515 items</a> and I will continue to use Flickr until either it disappears from the web, or I die. (Hopefully the latter will be the case &#8212; I don&#8217;t wanna move that many pictures and metadata.) My biggest gripe with Flickr isn&#8217;t even really with Flickr itself &#8212; it&#8217;s with how browsers handle the map.  <br />
I love to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/map">place images on maps</a> so I know where I&#8217;ve been. But the processing needed to do all that (without a plugin like Flash) ain&#8217;t light. And 30 minutes of placing images on the map in <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox 2</a> would grind it to a halt, sucking up over 1 GB of memory. Although IE was better, its JavaScript engine was never very good. Firefox 3 was a huge step over Firefox 2 (it corrected the memory leak). None of them compare to Chrome. It&#8217;s ability to literally fly over the map astounds me. Thirty minutes of hardcore panning, placement, jumping, and moving (with the hybrid map turned on) did nothing to kill performance.  <br />
With 1.3 GB of RAM already in use by other applications, I should add.  <br />
And I need to figure out how on the internet (as opposed to &#8220;how on Earth&#8221;) Chrome managed to slice 75% off the loading time for <a href="http://www.rolex.com/">Rolex.com</a> down here. In Costa Rica (at least on the lousy connection I have right now), it takes forever to load my favourite website. But with Chrome, it was zip-BANG-done. I am stunned. <em>Stunned</em>, I tell you!<br />
(I should note that down here, the lags in response time are much more exaggerated. So when something like Chrome suddenly yanks those delays out, you notice it.)<br />
Okay, okay, so not everything is all sunshine and lollipops. I have noticed a few things:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome ain&#8217;t perfectly handling <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>&#8216;s scripting. I have to remind Chrome where the cursor is supposed to be. (Noticed this as I write this entry.)</li>
<li>It&#8217;s lauded memory management seems a bit weird. Although performance wasn&#8217;t affected, Chrome seems to cache a lot of material in memory. Over 100 MB of data while I was in Flickr (and I&#8217;m sure I haven&#8217;t downloaded 100 MB of map data). Given, it cleaned it all up when I closed the tab, but it still seems odd.  </li>
<li>Chrome kicks up a minimum of two processes in memory. It seems to be one for the browser itself, and one per tab. This is inline with Google&#8217;s &#8220;multi-process&#8221; design &#8230; but do we really need to see each process?</li>
<li>Plugins. We need plugins. Someone build <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> for Chrome, please!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros vs. cons aside, the biggest problem Chrome has is market presence. The average public doesn&#8217;t know about Chrome, and they&#8217;re not going to go out of their way to get Chrome (though they should). Despite a press conference that was held just before launch today, the average person will take much longer to even hear of Chrome, let alone use it.  <br />
But Firefox, my old friend, you&#8217;ve been supplanted. Chrome wins this round. I still like you, though &#8212; you&#8217;ve been a trusted friend and assistant for years. And you&#8217;ll remain in my development toolset until further notice. Do yourself a favour &#8212; learn from Google. They&#8217;ve got a few tricks that you haven&#8217;t picked up on yet.  <br />
And <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft</a>? [Picks up Ballmer&#8217;s head and slams it repeatedly into a concrete wall.] PAY ATTENTION. <strong>GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK FUCKING SKULL</strong>. This is how development should be done. See how a real browser works.<br />
I suddenly feel a need to kneel at the Altar of Google and make a sacrifical offering. I hope a bottle of Coke will suffice.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike other conferences I&#8217;ve been to, they seem to have a lot of keynotes. Strikes me as a little odd. The only real person who do a &#8220;true&#8221; keynote would be O&#8217;Reilly, since he coined this term in the first place. He did that yesterday, and didn&#8217;t really say anything different (at least from what I&#8217;ve read).<br />
<span id="more-939"></span>[I hope I got all these names right. They didn&#8217;t all display them when they hit the stage.]<br />
Running a video which looks like it was taken over the last couple of days. Kinda hokey.<br />
Brad Forrest (O&#8217;Reilly), Jennifer Pahlka (TechWeb) hosting/emceeing<br />
Battelle/Andreessen Interview</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduced John Battelle, CEO Federated Media, who is in turn introducing Marc Andreessen</li>
<li>Looks like an interview. Man, Andreesen&#8217;s gotten old. I remember when he was a student. (Mind, I was a student at the time. I guess I&#8217;m old, too.)</li>
<li>Question: Did you realise what Mosaic might become?
<ul>
<li>No. Didn&#8217;t know what kind of world that it would create.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: At what point did you know you were on to something?
<ul>
<li>When it went viral during the beta testing. It wasn&#8217;t until they founded Netscape that they really knew.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Believes that most traditional media companies (e.g. newspaper) are totally unprepared for the swing in the industry (i.e. Web 2.0 affecting business models)</li>
<li>The issue of Microsoft deciding in 1995 that they were going to build a competitor to Netscape
<ul>
<li>Andreessen responds that Microsoft used the code that he wrote at the University of Illinois (as part of Mosaic), which he finds &#8220;exciting&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Question: What do you think of the current landscape?
<ul>
<li>Big surprise is how many of the early ideas have lasted, such as JavaScript, cookies (which &#8220;Vint Cerf cooked up over a weekend&#8221;), the back and forward buttons (which are now appearing in operating systems)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mild slam at Microsoft: industry has said it&#8217;s not about the PC, it&#8217;s about the web platform (the &#8220;cloud&#8221;). Microsoft just recanted and said it was about the &#8220;mesh&#8221;. Both Battelle and Andreesen nodded: it&#8217;s the &#8220;cloud&#8221; with a different name.</li>
<li>Most kids today communicating through social networks &#8212; through the browser &#8212; which no-one saw coming years ago</li>
<li>Microsoft: &#8220;wonderful company&#8221;</li>
<li>Very pragmatic view of Microsoft buying Yahoo: feels that it&#8217;s a natural progression, although it is a bit sad that the company will likely loose its independence</li>
<li>Thinks that there is a &#8220;coming nuclear winter&#8221;
<ul>
<li>The credit crunch is wreaking havoc within the industry; could bring back the same crunch after the dotcom crash</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Every part of the economy is tightly linked, and the crunch will start affecting marketing budgets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Big conversation on basis of Ning (platform for social platforms)</li>
<li>Believes that if Microsoft and IBM hadn&#8217;t standardised the PC platform, this industry wouldn&#8217;t be where it is now
<ul>
<li>Also believes that the mobile industry is being held back for exactly the same reason &#8212; no standardisation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jonathan Zittrain</p>
<ul>
<li>Jonathan Zittrain unable to attend, showing only a video on his book: The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It.</li>
<li>Some vague mention of &#8220;in the interest of reducing the carbon footprint of this conference&#8221;; c&#8217;mon, the only way to reduce the footprint is NOT TO HAVE IT</li>
</ul>
<p>Mitchell Baker, Mozilla</p>
<ul>
<li>Wild hair style</li>
<li>Wants to talk about the user experience</li>
<li>Shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the mobile web &#8212; it should be just one web
<ul>
<li>Device independence, allowing any device to see exactly the same thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One web is important. Okay, we get it. Next point, please.</li>
<li>&#8220;Browser&#8221; is a bad metaphor. We don&#8217;t browse the web, we create it. We mash it. We do everything but merely look at it.</li>
<li>Need an open web development platform &#8212; plug for Firefox
<ul>
<li>Pushing perhaps a little too hard for Firefox, IMO</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firefox now runs properly on mobile devices
<ul>
<li>Fenik (Fennick? Fenick? It&#8217;s a Brazilian fox) is a specific produce release</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&#8220;Mobile&#8221; also a misnomer. Devices aren&#8217;t mobile, people are. If a device is mobile without me, that&#8217;s a problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ari Balogh, Yahoo CTO</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of stats. We know Yahoo is big. Really big.</li>
<li>Yahoo! Open Strategy
<ul>
<li>Rewiring to create development platform to open assets to all developers, everywhere</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Customer experience will be social throughout</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SearchMonkey development beta now open</li>
<li>People will be able to add their own applications/components to their Yahoo! sites (e.g. front page)</li>
<li>Social is not a destination, it&#8217;s a dimension</li>
<li>SearchMonkey is the first part of this; the rest of the Y! OS (open strategy) framework will come later this year</li>
<li>Pretty slick stuff &#8212; has a lot of potential and ability</li>
</ul>
<p>Ofer Shaked, Current.tv</p>
<ul>
<li>70% of Current watchers have a computer in the room where they watch TV</li>
<li>Minor redesign greatly increased the social feedback</li>
<li>Reviewing popular media</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Pirwin(?), MySpace</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems a bit odd to be talking about MySpace instead of Facebook, or possibly the &#8220;next Facebook&#8221;</li>
<li>85 GB of bandwidth, 11% of online minutes in US are on MySpace</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the afternoon session today, I&#8217;m going to learn what it&#8217;ll take to build the next generation of apps. I&#8217;m curious to see what they&#8217;ve got to say.<br />
<span id="more-929"></span>Presenter: Dion Hinchcliffe</p>
<ul>
<li>Room is about 90% full, compared to previous session</li>
<li>Poll shows 45% tech architect/dev, 45% product management, 10% other</li>
</ul>
<p>I fear that this might be more beginner than I thought. This seems to be covering a lot of existing Web 2.0. I hope it&#8217;s just to set common background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to look into social graphing as a metrics method</li>
<li>Badges are becoming most popular form of widgets (e.g. Flickr, but I have no idea what this is, need to find an example)</li>
<li>W3C trying to define the Web Widget as a standard, likely to be undermined by the industry who will not wait for them to get it all done</li>
</ul>
<p>Yep. Basic information, mostly. I gather a lot of people here are fairly new to all this. Not as bad as the introductory SES stuff we had, but still&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Some service providers have rate limits (e.g. Google Maps) after which you have to pay; Amazon requires it from the get-go</li>
<li>Basing yourself on other services has drawbacks:
<ul>
<li>Weakest link syndrome (e.g. Amazon S3 outage)</li>
<li>Limited economy of scale due to dependency on others</li>
<li>Requires as good legal skills as dev skills to handle SLA issues</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Top APIs available on ProgrammableWeb.com (which is partnered with IBM)</li>
<li>Twitter built on Amazon tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, minor rant: Woman just in front of me asked if I &#8220;had to do all that typing&#8221;. For crying out loud, lady, this is a Web 2.0 technology conference, not a press conference for Fergie. <strong>SUCK IT UP!!</strong> I can&#8217;t help it if I learned to type on a classic clunky IBM keyboard and have had hard keystrokes ever since.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to look at Yahoo! Geocoding as an alternative for Google&#8217;s</li>
<li>Platform solutions tend to beat an application for ROI and customer support every time</li>
<li>Amazon EC2 allows rapid roll out of virtualised servers
<ul>
<li>Second level Amazon apps (based on Amazon services): Jungle Disk, Digital Chalk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>There is no proven ROI on social networking apps (e.g. Facebook app)</strong></li>
<li>Numbers in XML data harder to process, increases parsing time &#8212; use JSON for numeric data instead</li>
<li>Dion believes REST is better than SOAP (mostly due to ease in parsing REST data)</li>
<li>Google Gadgets
<ul>
<li>47k widgets available, all through iGoogle (and outside use?)</li>
<li>OpenSocial based on Google Gadgets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>WidgetBox
<ul>
<li>50k+ widgets</li>
<li>2.5m serves of the widgets</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of discussion on mashups. A lot of &#8220;we know that already&#8221; info here. One interesting piece: Facebook and Amazon have an interesting partnership that allows someone to create a Facebook app, host it through Amazon, and rollout a <strong>grid-served application with no infrastructure for little cost</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Major APIs (in order)
<ul>
<li>RSS</li>
<li>REST</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>SOAP</li>
<li>ATOM is upcoming but not in the top 4 (ATOM is REST-compliant, so might overtake SOAP before long)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Long section on AJAX. Sorry, I mean Ajax. Nothing we haven&#8217;t done at least a dozen times here.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dion a big proponent of Silverlight, but seems to be missing some details
<ul>
<li>Microsoft rep told us Silverlight could not yet handle 3D outside of Windows due to rendering engine; similar note about HD video</li>
<li>Either doesn&#8217;t know a lot about Flash, or is unwilling to draw comparisons for some reason &#8212; much of what he claims as awesome about Silverlight is already in Flash</li>
<li>Agree that Flash needs to go Open Source to eliminate the last part of the RIA puzzle (only thing that&#8217;s still wholly proprietary)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JavaFX is Sun&#8217;s RIA tool (never heard of it until now); seems to be geared mostly to mobile
<ul>
<li>Scripted, not compiled</li>
<li>Does not replace Swing, but makes it easier to develop</li>
<li>Can be used to create arbitrarily large apps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A note on RIA and metrics: Using asynchronous apps kill the pageviews metric. (Yahoo! got burned for this a while back.) Need to make sure that we account for this by tagging sub-apps and/or data.</p>
<ul>
<li>New developments
<ul>
<li>New tools are great, but you lose performance with greater abstraction (e.g. Ruby)</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails is great, runs Twitter; massive performance drawback</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>IBM has proved 10-20x savings in initial dev costs over traditional tech, like Java</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>CakePHP is a framework written in PHP, modelled after Ruby on Rails (but not a port)</li>
<li>Groovy &amp; Grails is a Ruby on Rails-like framework for Java</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Does not have performance drawbacks of Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>Could be a hot one to keep an eye on, and run tests with</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Platform As A Service (PaaS)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Google App Engine</li>
<li>Amazon AWS, EC2 (Elastic Server on Demand)</li>
<li>Heroku</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep sight of the goals
<ul>
<li>Watch your competition (don&#8217;t replicate what they did, you need to outdo them)</li>
<li>Know your customers</li>
<li>Use the right tools for the right reasons</li>
<li>&#8220;This is an arms race&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably noticed a <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/microsoft/">few posts about Microsoft on this site</a>. Most of them are rants. And, indeed, there are those who&#8217;ve noticed <a href="http://experiencematters.criticalmass.com/2007/10/20/is-microsofts-popfly-an-easy-out/">me picking on Microsoft on Experience Matters</a> as well. (Certainly, <a href="http://experiencematters.criticalmass.com/contributors/neil-clemmons/">Neil</a>&#8216;s noticed it and taken me to task on that.)<br />
But I don&#8217;t do it for the sake of doing it. Ranting (bitching, complaining, whatever you want to call it) is pointless without reason. And it&#8217;s only with a bit of retrospect that I&#8217;ve come to the root of my problem with Microsoft.<br />
In short, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t suck. But it could be a whole lot better.<br />
<span id="more-914"></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft has been around for 33 years</a>, and has been a mainstay in the computer industry since the early 80s with the release of MS-DOS. They went from a small company of a couple of people to the largest software company on the planet, capable of wiping out smaller companies (witness the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=microsoft+antitrust">countless issues with Microsoft antitrust</a>) in the act of solidifying their majority market share.<br />
Despite the &#8220;Evil Empire moniker&#8221;, Microsoft is a business that operates much as many businesses before it (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Oil">Standard Oil</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Telephone_%26_Telegraph">AT&amp;T</a>, and &#8212; it could be argued &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific">Union Pacific</a>), which is to make money and ensure that your position in the market is solid. Yes, I chose those companies specifically (broken up by antitrust lawsuits, or accused of monopolistic habits), because Microsoft emulates many of the behaviours.<br />
(For the record, so do Google and Yahoo!, but no-one has gone after them. Yet.)<br />
Anyway, back to Microsoft. They&#8217;ve been around a very, very long time. Longer than 95% of other software companies (rough estimate, could be even higher). That longevity has brought them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wild success (Windows 3.x)</li>
<li>Significant failure (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_bob">Microsoft Bob</a>)</li>
<li>Tough competition (Google, Linux, Adobe, Sony, Apple)</li>
<li>Governments forcing Microsoft to recognise boundaries (namely, the antitrust suits in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft">the US</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Microsoft_antitrust_case">in Europe</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>But something that I see more frequently from Microsoft is their inability to adapt to customer demands. In the earlier days, there wasn&#8217;t much of a need to do so &#8212; people were very quick to adopt new products and concepts, and upgrade constantly to get better, faster features.<br />
Incidentally, that kept in pace with hardware development, as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> meant that every 18 months, there were computers that could process your work faster (and hence more efficiently) than before. Moore&#8217;s Law is finally slowing down (we&#8217;re finally running up against the physical restrictions of the silicon medium), which means that most of the non-gamers out there (which is the majority) don&#8217;t really have a pressing need to upgrade frequently anymore. Computers more than two years old are still operating perfectly for the need.<br />
I think Microsoft&#8217;s last major push without significant objection was Windows 2000. The Windows NT platform had served Microsoft well in terms of building a solid operating system that could handle a variety of needs &#8212; and visual graphics weren&#8217;t too heavy a need (Windows was still largely a business-oriented environment). I also think the first major &#8220;why&#8221; started with Windows XP.<br />
Admittedly, my memory is a little fuzzy these days on specifics on this (nor can I find articles on this), but I do remember that there was a question &#8212; why should we move away from Windows 2000? Given, there was the end-of-life for Windows 2000 to consider, but from an end-user&#8217;s perspective, what was fundamentally wrong?<br />
Since that day, the &#8220;why&#8221; question has come up more often. <a href="http://apcmag.com/microsoft_humble_pie_over_office_bloat.htm">Microsoft Office continues to bloat</a> with features most people don&#8217;t need. I&#8217;m a proficient Word user, and have been so since about 1990, yet I use at most 50% of the functions in the system. (And yes, I used to be a Technical Writer, so I do know what Word has to offer.) The memory footprint of these software packages is also quite large &#8212; almost obscenely so when one considers the type of document these packages handle.<br />
And yes, I&#8217;m making comparisons to packages like WordPerfect, OpenOffice, and even some web-based items like Google Docs. I&#8217;m talking the ability to create productivity information and share it appropriately.<br />
More importantly is an issue I&#8217;ve had with large software companies for a long time: setting a   schedule and sticking to it come hell or high water.<br />
Yeah, I know, that sounds really silly &#8212; why is that a bad thing? For one reason, which I know very, very well in my own industry. If you set a hard deadline, you will (almost invariably) get to a point where shortcuts are necessary to launch the product on time. In the world of marketing, it&#8217;s often unavoidable to handle all the various moving parts of a campaign. But in the world of software, your restrictions are more under your own control.<br />
Microsoft has this problem. They release products before they&#8217;re ready. And problems occur. Vista is the single best (and most recent) example of this. So many shortcuts were made that <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/03/why_did_vista_s.html">drivers were left uncompleted</a> (many vendors wouldn&#8217;t recommend them), the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060518-6863.html">hardware requirements</a> put most people in the position of needing a new computer (Mac OS X &#8220;Leopard&#8221; runs on 3+ year old G4s without a significant problem), and everyone asked &#8220;why&#8221;?<br />
Why do I pick on Microsoft? Because after all this &#8212; 33 years in the biz and more collective experience than   most of the rest of the industry, combined &#8212; they should know better.<br />
Yes, I have high expectations for Microsoft. Experience demands it. They should know that rushing out a product is asking for trouble. They should know that making enemies of your customers will drive them elsewhere, and they should know that there are equivalent alternatives that people are more than willing to use.<br />
They should know. But I&#8217;m not seeing enough of the proof.<br />
What should Microsoft do? I&#8217;ve got a few thoughts on that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a>. He&#8217;s just not appropriate for that company. He doesn&#8217;t understand the industry and his ego writes cheques that Microsoft can&#8217;t cash. Ray Ozzie gets it, and he&#8217;s the kind of solid ego you can rely on.</li>
<li>Embrace your customer&#8217;s input on your software. Right now, if I have a problem, I have to call someone. Think forums or blogs. Allow people to bring the issues up, even let them rant. But let the community know that you&#8217;ve identified the issue and are working on it. (I still see certain issues &#8212; namely paragraph numbering &#8212; in Word that have dogged me for years that I&#8217;ve logged several calls on. Likely all long-forgotten.)</li>
<li>Make Windows free. Compete directly with Linux. You don&#8217;t have to go to the point of open source, but remove the barrier to entry.</li>
<li>Allow the community to write drivers. Why do you think Linux took off so quickly? All you needed was one person to write a driver to use Linux on a different piece of hardware.</li>
<li>Extend your evangelism program beyond developers to your business products. I still deal with sales people who want all-Microsoft implementations. The developer evangelists know that it&#8217;s not achievable, and it&#8217;s a great way to kill a sale. Understand what your potential customers have, and determine how you can help with what they&#8217;ve got. You&#8217;ll find the softer approach works much better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay. There&#8217;s my reason. I think Microsoft has potential. They just need to recognise it more.</p>
