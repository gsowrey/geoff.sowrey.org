However, that said, there is NOTHING in the news about how the other terminals are faring at Heathrow airport. Does anyone know what baggage delays &#8212; if any &#8212; exist at the other terminals? Pileups at one surely must affect the others. Any and all pointers are appreciated! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, I know &#8212; why am I on a computer if I&#8217;m on vacation?<br />
Relax, I have good reason. Our house is now effectively sold, and for whatever reason we&#8217;ve been unable to fax properly from Hawaii back to Calgary. Very odd, indeed. However, when you need to communicate with your realtor and faxes don&#8217;t work, you resort to whatever &#8220;official&#8221; form of communication they suggest. In this case, email.<br />
Hence the computer. But given the trouble we&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;m sticking out for a few minutes to make sure it went through.<br />
<span id="more-685"></span>It&#8217;s already day 4, and I&#8217;m only just getting into a vacation now. Day 1 was spent trying to get here. Delayed departure due to weather, nearly missed the connecting flight in Denver, mechanical problems in Honolulu put us late into Kona. And my bag? Yeah, left behind in Denver.<br />
Hint to United Airlines: If a plane comes in late, allow time for bags to be sent through properly. And when someone calls in to ask about the whereabouts of their bag, don&#8217;t lie to them, either.<br />
Day 2 was finding my bag. Ugh.<br />
Day 3 we went up and down the coast a bit before going out on a &#8220;dinner cruise&#8221;. The locals refer to it as a &#8220;booze cruise&#8221;. Not great when you can&#8217;t drink. And there&#8217;s a very loud bridal party.<br />
Today, we went to a timeshare presentation. No, we didn&#8217;t buy one (if we&#8217;d had the money, we would have, though). It took $100 off our activities cost, so we couldn&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />
Anyway, time&#8217;s almost up and there&#8217;s been no bounce with the email, so I presume all is good. Back to trying to forget about computers for a few more days&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We slept last night with the sliding door to the balcony open (with the screen door closed) and the air conditioning off. A bit humid, but wow, does one feel better with fresh air in your lungs.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve slept so well in &#8230; months.<br />
<span id="more-689"></span>We awoke to the remnants of a rainstorm, and a double rainbow out on the water. In the light, we could see a much nicer view of the hotel grounds and of the bay just north of the hotel. Surfers were already out in force.<br />
After a buffet breakfast (there&#8217;s nothing like fresh pineapple) we came back for much needed showers and to change into clothes for the day. Well, Alex did. I couldn&#8217;t. No bag. It&#8217;s still lost.<br />
Calling United Airlines didn&#8217;t help. I was blatantly lied to. My bag is in Honolulu. Okay, so I called Aloha. Nope. Not in Honolulu. Not in Kona, either. In fact, not with Aloha at all. Call United.<br />
I was cheesed that I had to call <em>anybody</em>, for the record. When <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/01/the-tale-of-the-missing-backpack/">British Airlines lost my bag</a> (mostly due to my fault, I should add), they delivered it to me at my hotel. Not remotely as much stress as I&#8217;m under now.<br />
So I call United back. I explain that I&#8217;m not happy in as pleasant a way as possible. In reality, I&#8217;m about two seconds from tearing the poor agent several new holes. I very much dislike being lied to.<br />
(Vacation&#8217;s getting off to a great start, ain&#8217;t it?)<br />
The bag&#8217;s in Denver, still. A couple more questions, and I find out that, no, it&#8217;s actually in Los Angeles. My friggin&#8217; bag is getting around more than I am. I should be thankful, really &#8212; 15 years ago, this would be beyond hell. I ask very bluntly when the bag will appear on the Big Island. At this point, couldn&#8217;t care less about whether it&#8217;ll come to my hotel automatically, I&#8217;ll pick the damned thing up.<br />
After a few minutes on hold, I&#8217;m told they&#8217;ll call me when it arrives. Great. I still have to suffer through 25 degree heat with pants and heavy shoes. My shorts and sandals are in transit.<br />
Now to really amaze me, we got a phone call no less than 30 minutes after we left the hotel room that my bag had arrived in Kona. Apparently, I was lied to the <em>second</em> time I called United. Not happy. Not happy at all.<br />
We drove down to the Coconut Place mall (not really a mall &#8212; more a collection of shops, really) where Alex made a beeline for the Crocs store. While there, I got a phone call from our realtor about our house.<br />
We&#8217;re still clearing conditions. Financing and house inspection. The report was back from inspection, and the net of it wasn&#8217;t surprising. Floor damage. Siding missing (has to be replaced, still), and the stairs at the back are unattractive (buy try and break &#8217;em &#8212; I dare ya!). And it&#8217;s dirty.<br />
DIRTY? I just about went ape on the poor woman. Never tell an already stressed guy who&#8217;s wearing the same clothes for 36 hours and has had a very bad morning with an airline regarding a missing bag that the house he&#8217;s selling (and packing up to move out of) is &#8220;dirty&#8221;.<br />
Ugh.<br />
Further down the road, we found the Kona Marketplace. And I caved in and bought new sandals. I had to &#8212; my feet were dying.<br />
Returning to the room, I got the message my bag had arrived. I figured an hour to the airport and back would suffice.<br />
Problems: Kailua-Kona has bad traffic (not enough roads; too many people). And several others were trying to find their bags, too. I barely made it back in time for dinner. I was unfairly grumpy at my return.<br />
Dinner was good, though expensive (always are at hotels). Excellent waiter, though. Good service goes a long way to improving one&#8217;s attitude, I find.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oy. This vacation is not off to a good start.<br />
One of the conditions of this vacation was that we were to incur no red-eye flights (in other words, no sleeping on the plane). That meant getting there and back was going to cause some difficulty in how we went from Calgary (a second-tier airport) to Kona (a second-to-third tier airport). Direct flight? Hah!<br />
<span id="more-686"></span>Calgary to Denver. Denver to Honolulu. Honolulu to Kona. About 14 hours all told, including running through airports to catch connecting flights.<br />
The drive out to the airport this morning was a little worrisome. We&#8217;d been hearing since yesterday morning that we were going to have a serious snowfall. Being Calgary, that means a <em>lot</em> of snow, not just a little. And a lot of snow tends to wreak havoc with flights.<br />
At 5:30, the DJs on the radio were suggesting people start to work in advance of the coming blizzard. I was not exactly thrilled with our chances. But we saw no snow all the way to the airport.<br />
Checked in, went through US Customs and through security (both remarkably easy, for a change) and went to have something to eat. Alex wanted a bagel, which was not to be found anywhere. I&#8217;d have settled for napkin if that&#8217;s all that could be had. Airlines don&#8217;t feed you anymore, not even pretzels, so you&#8217;ve got to cover your own food issues.<br />
Waiting at the gate, I realized that I couldn&#8217;t see downtown. From the gate (which I&#8217;ve left through before), I normally can.<br />
Then I couldn&#8217;t see Nose Hill.<br />
Damn.<br />
Snow was falling as I walked down the gangway into the plane. I already knew we were going to have to de-ice, putting us behind schedule. And we didn&#8217;t have a long time to make our connecting flight in Denver. Ninety minutes goes more quickly than you think.<br />
For some reason, a lot of flights leave Calgary at around 8:00. And they all needed de-icing. Thirty minutes passed before we finally started to taxi to the runway. Start. Stop. Start. Stop. I was starting to crawl the walls. Alex was probably ready to divorce me on the spot and find another seat in the plane.<br />
Never put an already stressed out person on a plane that doesn&#8217;t leave on schedule. It&#8217;s not pretty.<br />
Finally, the engines wound up, the roar filled the cabin, and the plane started down the runway &#8230; only to stop about 250 metres down. The plane turned off onto one of the taxiways while Alex prepared to peel me off the ceiling.<br />
Something hardware-related. After 20 minutes, the pilot announced that it was fixed, and that as soon as they&#8217;d filed their paperwork, we&#8217;d be off. I almost bit through my tongue to prevent from yelling: &#8220;FILL IT OUT WHEN WE&#8217;RE AIRBORNE!&#8221;<br />
Now, for the record, I totally understand why this is done on the ground. My desire to get out of Calgary pretty much cancelled out all reason.<br />
We arrived in Denver quite late. Twenty-five minutes before our next flight left. In at Gate 8, out at Gate 94. (Or something like that &#8230; a long way down, either way.) Denver is a LONG airport.<br />
The next flight left on time. In the back of my head, I knew this was a problem. I knew this would be an issue. And it was.<br />
It&#8217;s a seven hour flight to Honolulu from Denver. That&#8217;s seven hours with only one movie (<em>Happy Feet</em>) and no meals. WTF. It&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; long flight, and you want me to shell out $5 for a crappy box with a couple of crackers, some cream cheese, apple sauce, and cookies? I don&#8217;t even like cream cheese!<br />
If my Dad hadn&#8217;t been cremated, he&#8217;d be spinning so fast in his grave the whirring would sound like a power drill. That&#8217;s just spectacularly poor, folks. (That&#8217;s United Airlines, in case anyone&#8217;s wondering.)<br />
Arriving in Honolulu, we were greeted with the moist warmth that comes after a rainfall. For a moment, time actually slowed down while we walked from one part of the terminal to another (outside) to pick up our bags. For a moment, everything was great.<br />
A moment later, it all came crashing down again. I found Alex&#8217;s bag about two seconds before I heard:<br />
&#8220;Paging United passenger Alexandra &#8230; Sohr-ee&#8221;.<br />
They always fuck up the last name. It&#8217;s not rocket science, people. Sowrey. Sow-ree. Say it with me &#8230; SOW-REE.<br />
My bag, which had gone on the plane at the same time as Alex&#8217;s, hadn&#8217;t made it from Denver. I was clothes-less. Sandal-less. Toothpaste-less. (Alex, as I had her makeup bag in my bag, was toiletry-less.) But United did provide us with two &#8220;temporary&#8221; toiletry kits, containing the smallest damned toothpaste I&#8217;ve ever seen, and a deodorant stick that &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say I was pretty surprised that it worked. My bag, so they say, will arrive tomorrow.<br />
We went over to Aloha Airlines in the Interisland wing and booked in for our next flight. Badda-bing, badda-boom, and we&#8217;re standing in front of Gate 52 for out last flight of the day.<br />
We&#8217;ve flown Aloha before. Nice, easy, fast. Just like WestJet, only smaller. And no pre-assigned seats.<br />
The plane backed out from the gate, and slowly spun so we could nose forward under our own power. Then something went &#8230; bad. It felt sort of like the nose gear suddenly spun sideways &#8212; something it&#8217;s not supposed to do. At first, it was just curiousity why we were sitting there. Then the pilot came on, telling us that we might have to go back to the gate.<br />
Figures.<br />
Sure enough, 20 minutes later, we&#8217;re back at the gate, filing out to line up at Gate 53 for another plane, yet to arrive. A little over an hour after we were to depart, we finally left Honolulu airport (successfully) for our 45 minute jaunt to Kona.<br />
Kona&#8217;s a neat little airport &#8212; doesn&#8217;t even look like a traditional airport, it&#8217;s all little huts, and most of the operations are outside. Funky.<br />
Got Alex&#8217;s bag, hopped on the Budget bus to pick up the rental car, and nearly got lost getting to the hotel. We missed the sunset. The <a href="http://www.expedia.ca/pub/agent.dll?qscr=dspv&amp;htid=151125&amp;itid=187705779&amp;from=i">Outrigger Keauhou Beach Resort</a> ain&#8217;t exactly the ritz, but at 3.5 stars (according to Expedia), I felt it should have been better.<br />
Mind you, I could just be in a really sour mood given the day I&#8217;ve had.</p>

The backpack is actually here. However, it&#8217;s still at Heathrow (or at least was an hour ago) going through customs.<br />
I&#8217;m very happy I didn&#8217;t pack any foodstuffs aside from the dehydrated soup. A jar of peanut butter might set off import alarms.<br />
The saga goes on. I need a shave. I need a clean shirt. I <strong>desperately</strong> want clean underwear.<br />
The joys of travel!</p>

As I wrote yesterday, my bag is missing. British Airlines didn&#8217;t deliver it along with myself to London, England, which has left me a little understocked in the underwear department (among other things).<br />
<span id="more-516"></span>Now how this happened, I&#8217;m not sure. As you might recall, I had made a point of checking with British Airlines when I checked in at San Francisco to make sure that my bag was properly tranferred from Alaska Airlines. They assured me it had, and would be on the flight.<br />
Obviously, it didn&#8217;t.<br />
I called British Airways this morning (and put into a wonderful-sounding queue &#8212; the British have a far more pleasant customer service practice than we have in North America, I must say!), and learned that they had found my bag. In San Francisco! It was put on a flight yesterday, and supposedly had touched down this morning, about when I had called. They didn&#8217;t know &#8220;for certain&#8221;? that the bag was, in fact, on the plane. Only that it &#8220;should&#8221;? be on the plane. Specifics wouldn&#8217;t be known for a couple of hours yet.<br />
So the tale continues, at least until it magically appears in our hotel room.<br />
Which I hope is soon, &#8220;cuz I <strong>really</strong> need a shave.</p>

The flight out to London was great. Wow. I love British Airways &#8212; amazing service for an airline. So far above anything Air Canada could ever hope to dish out. The food alone was better than most things I&#8217;ve cooked in the last little while.<br />
Well, except for one minor little detail. My backpack has gone missing. The bag with all my clothes, toiletries, and various supplies for the next seven weeks.<br />
<span id="more-515"></span>&#8220;Doh&#8221; doesn&#8217;t quite cut it.<br />
Oddly enough, I was neither surprised nor upset that this happened. Not even annoyed, really. I just accepted that it was an inevitability, and moved on with the day. Mind you, taking the Paddington Express from Heathrow was a little surreal without my belongings.<br />
We&#8217;re at the Hilton Metropole. It&#8217;s a pretty sweet little hotel &#8212; all 8,000 rooms of it. I thought the Chicago Hyatt was big. I think this place dwarfs it several times over. Our room is nice, not huge (though it has two queens), and hopefully comfy. Though after being up for almost 36 hours (save for a couple of cat naps on the plane), you could put me on a slab of concrete and I&#8217;d find it wonderful.<br />

Did a completely self-guided walking tour through central London, from the Marble Arch to Piccadilly Circus to Trafalgar Square to Big Ben to the London Eye to Cleopatra&#8217;s Needle before running into Amy (who was off buying yarn) on the Tube. Same car. How freaky is that?<br />

One note on Big Ben&#8230; A (strange) dream come true &#8212; one I never knew I even had. I never would have imagined that simply hearning the clock strike the hour (six, as it turned out) would be so significant.<br />
My grandmother had a wonderful grandfather clock (my aunt has it now), which plays the Westminster chime. I still can hear the sound of that clock. Today, at 18:00, I heard Big Ben play off the tune, and then strike six times. I&#8217;ve seen it before in movies and TV shows, but there&#8217;s nothing like hearing the actual strike of the big bell. You can actually feel it.<br />
So far, I like this city. A lot. though it is a babylon, in the truest sense of the origins of the word. There are hundreds of languages, dialects, and accents here. But unlike the biblical Babylon, it seems to work here. It&#8217;s a strange, but beautiful mix.<br />
Now if I could just figure out how to get this computer to recognize my camera&#8230;</p>
