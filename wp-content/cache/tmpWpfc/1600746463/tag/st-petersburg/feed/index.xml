								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03526.JPG" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" width="300" /></a><br />
Our British Airways 747 to London:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03527.JPG" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" width="300" /></a><br />
The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03533.JPG" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03567.JPG" alt="A small, nameless Siberian village" width="300" /></a><br />
And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a><br />
We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a><br />
A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a><br />
Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a><br />
I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />

Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />

One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a rainy day when my brother Raoul&#8230; no, wait, sorry &#8212; that&#8217;s a Pizzaville ad.<br />
But it was a rainy day here (the rain only recently finally stopped). Amy and I were going to do the church tour today, but walking to the Peter and Paul Fortress would have soaked us through. Not really an option.  Instead, we opted for the <a href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/st-isaacs-cathedral.asp">St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral</a>, about a click down the road.<br />
<span id="more-528"></span>The last time I saw St. Isaac&#8217;s, it was still in need of work. It&#8217;s one of the largest and tallest buildings in St. Petersburg, and its golden dome was used by the Nazis for shelling the then Leningrad. The photos of the church&#8217;s history show that by the end of the war, St. Isaac&#8217;s was little more than a jagged shell of its former glory.<br />
In 1989, bullet holes were still present in the outer walls and columns. Much of the interior had been somewhat repaired, but it was a far cry from complete. In 1997, a massive restoration project restored the church back to its pre-WWII beauty.<br />
For 440 rubles, you can scamper up a tall, circular staircase to the colonnade to see the St. Petersburg skyline (it&#8217;s quite breathtaking from up there), visit the museum, and shoot non-professional photos (basically, you&#8217;re not using a tripod). It&#8217;s pricey, but it&#8217;s worth it. The interior of St. Isaac&#8217;s alone is worth it &#8212; I have no idea how much they spent on the work, but the results speak for themselves.<br />
The interior is gorgeous. Allow me to show you a few things. First, the holy interior of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03548.JPG" alt="The holy interior of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy dome of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03549.JPG" alt="The holy dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy altar of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03551.JPG" alt="The holy altar of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy candle room of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03552.JPG" alt="The holy candle room of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy ATM of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03550.JPG" alt="The holy ATM of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
(Yeah, that was a little weird to see.)<br />
Amy opted not to climb the colonnade, so finished with the museum (the rest of the church) by the time I got there. We met up afterwards in the Astoria Hotel for tea. Sheerly lethal sweets, I might add (the chocolate mousse was enough to make me cry). A little indulgence for such a wet day.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03553.JPG" alt="Tea at the Astoria Hotel" width="300" /></a><br />
We returned to the hostel for a while before wandering back out to the Palace Square to see what was going on out there. The military have been practicing for a few days for the big celebrations on 9 May (60 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany). They were apparently pretty bad on Wednesday. Not too bad today, though I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t appreciate being in the rain.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03554.JPG" alt="Military drills in Palace Square" width="300" /></a><br />
We&#8217;re getting ready for our train to Moscow tonight. We leave in about two hours. We can only hope we&#8217;re not trapped in a cabin with vodka-toting Russians. Our new Israeli roommate took all day to recover from his sojourn here yesterday as a result of that&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Turns out that our excursion to Tinkoff to discuss politics turned into a football lesson. (That&#8217;s &#8220;football&#8221; as in how the rest of the world defines &#8220;soccer&#8221; for us North Americans.) Kat and Nick are huge fans. So large, as a matter of fact, that Kat is delaying her departure to Khazakstan so she can catch the cup game her favourite team will be playing.<br />
<span id="more-527"></span>I tried to have Kat explain to me the whole cup/league thing for &#8220;final&#8221; games, and to her credit, she tried. It didn&#8217;t sink in.<br />
Tinkoff was also broadcasting games between St. Petersburg and Moscow, and between Russia and Italy. A group of fairly drunk Russians in the back kept trying to sing the &#8220;Ole, ole, ole, ole&#8221; chant often heard in football games, but were either so drunk they couldn&#8217;t sing or were utterly tone deaf.<br />
Then it was on to music. Nick&#8217;s a music fiend. He has a lot of exposure to music of many types, which led to a few interesting arguments about who was good and who wasn&#8217;t. The different perspectives are definitely interesting to hear.<br />
I was accused of starting some of these conversations because I had something to day. I suppose that&#8217;s true, and anyone who knows me knows that I do usually need to open my big yapper. But it was unintentional &#8212; I like to see where conversation goes.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oy. The last 36-ish hours have been a whirlwind of activity.<br />
Hit the Hermitage, as you already know, and then hit it up a second time to find the errant Picasso section (which wasn&#8217;t well-marked on the &#8220;map&#8221; we were given). This was over two days, I might add.<br />
<span id="more-526"></span>Amy had to take a breather yesterday (<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/04/ouch/">as she&#8217;s already blogged</a>), so I took a suggestion and went in search of the Railway Technology Museum here in St. Petersburg.<br />
It&#8217;s south of the downtown section, and a Metro stop or two away. I decided to walk it, not really having anything else planned for the afternoon. Besides, Metro stations hide everything from you &#8212; it&#8217;s a lot easier to see a city when you&#8217;re looking right at it.<br />
I was told that the museum was next to the (now thoroughly-gutted and utterly defunct) Warsaw railway station. (St. Petersburg&#8217;s railway stations seem to be named for the country or city you would go to from that station.) According to the map in the Lonely Planet guide, you&#8217;re supposed to walk down the east side of the station, and there the museum should be.<br />
When I looked down the side, all I saw were construction signs and a parking lot for empty freight trucks. After looking around elsewhere (just to make sure), I ventured down the road. I eventually found some trains off to the left, but they were actual in-use rail cars. I went to the right, almost behind the station, and found more in-use cars. But curiousity was thoroughly engaged by this point, and I went just a bit further&#8230;<br />
&#8230;and was rewarded with the sight of a large and very blue Russian 4-8-4 steam locomotive. Conversing (very poorly) with the elderly female ticket clerk, I bought myself a ticket along with eight &#8220;tickets&#8221; of some kind (I&#8217;m gonna need Pavel to translate the damn things), and entry into the park.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03542.JPG" width="300" alt="St. Petersburg Railway Technology Museum" /></a><br />
This is (almost) a train stalker&#8217;s paradise. There are no less than 50 examples of early-, mid-, and late- steam and electric locomotives (apparently, the diesels aren&#8217;t really wanted here), along with several examples of Russian rail cars.<br />
Actually, minor clarification. Most of these were actually <strong>Soviet</strong> locomotives and rail cars, easily identifiable by the &#8220;CCCP&#8221; or the hammer and sickle logo plastered on the side.<br />
There were definitely some oddball pieces, such as a few locomotives with what looked like skylights in the cabs, a wedge-shaped snowplow that looked like it might withstand a centimetre or two of snow, and a massive car left over from WWII featuring a <em>huge</em> cannon capable of firing what looked like 300mm shells. Not as big as Big Bertha, but still impressive.<br />
Running through a roll and a half of film (no, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised), and being quite cool, I wandered my way back to the hostel, where I apparently passed out from exhaustion. Amy and Nick found me curled up in the bed.<br />
This was when Amy and I learned that Nick had never tried sushi before. We took it upon ourselves to introduce him to our favourite food. For the record, St. Petersburg has <em>passable</em> Japanese. It&#8217;s not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse. Nick&#8217;s addicted now. Another convert.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03544.JPG" width="300" alt="St. Petersburg Railway Technology Museum" /></a><br />
Walking back, we came across a microbrewery called &#8220;Tinkoff&#8221;, a Russian-borne enterprise. Deciding that a beer was in order, we found ourselves staring at a bouncer and a metal detector. Things have most definitely changed here since when last I wandered the streets. The beer, though, was pretty tasty.<br />
Without much arm-twisting, I convinced Amy and Nick to do some night photography. Cities are beautiful places, but I find they look better at night.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03546.JPG" width="300" alt="St. Petersburg Railway Technology Museum" /></a><br />
We were up and running fast today as we attempted to catch the 9:58 train to <a href="http://eng.tzar.ru/">Tsarskoe Selo</a>, which is (yet another) palace that was started during the reign of Peter the Great (though it was actually his wife, Catherine, who built it as a surprise).<br />
Getting there was a bit of a challenge, namely in avoiding a potential cling-on, not getting our pockets picked, making sure we got off at the right station, and then finding our way there. We helped a German couple (students) get their tickets, and they walked with us to the palace.<br />
The grounds are quite nice &#8212; well-landscaped. They&#8217;ll look particularly nice in a few weeks after leaves start to appear on trees. Right now, it&#8217;s mostly naked.<br />
We tried to get into the Catherine Palace itself, as it&#8217;s where the <a href="http://www.tzar.ru/eamber/?from=1st">Amber Room</a> is located. I won&#8217;t go into the details (see the link for more). Sadly, due to the most <em>messed</em> up schedules that I can imagine, we couldn&#8217;t actually get tickets to go inside. At first, we thought they were open only 10:00-12:00, and 14:00-16:00. Turns out, that&#8217;s when they&#8217;re closed. This is what happens when you can&#8217;t read Russian.<br />
<a href=""><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03547.JPG" width="300" alt="St. Petersburg Railway Technology Museum" /></a><br />
We returned home. Probably a good thing &#8212; all the movement today was rather draining. Instead Amy, Nick, Kat (our new roommate; Kelly left this morning for Berlin) and I will reenact yesterday&#8217;s political analysis of Russia&#8217;s society at Tinkoff.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><cite>[This entry originally posted on <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/">How To Get Lost</a>: <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/05/pickpockets-suck/">Pickpockets suck!</a>.]</cite><br />
I&#8217;ve had two separate and unique run-ins with pickpockets. The first was at the Edgefest concert in Vancouver back in &#8220;99. I think we were listening to Sloan at the time, and some idiot came up behind me, dragging his finger up the back pocket in a vain attempt to pop whatever was in there (which was nothing) out. I should have reacted at the time, but never having been picked before, I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do.<br />
<span id="more-525"></span>Today was the second time. We&#8217;d been warned that the Nevsky Prospekt Metro station was a prime spot for pickpockets, and to ensure that our goods were safely locked away in wallets under the clothes (among other places). I&#8217;ve been travelling light, with only photocopies of my passport and a few hundred rubles (about $30) at any given time.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop the guy as we boarded the train from Technologichesky Institut to Pushkinskaya. Whether or not he had an accomplice at the door to force us together, I don&#8217;t know, but it seemed a little contrived. Warning bell was already ringing.<br />
Amy and I were pastered to each other, hanging on so the train wouldn&#8217;t knock us over. The would-be-pickpocket stood to my left, and attempted to shield his actions with a &#8220;well-placed&#8221; newspaper. I could see quite well, thank you very much.<br />
I decided it wasn&#8217;t a big deal until I felt something probing, trying to find my front left pocket. Emphasis on &#8220;trying&#8221;. What the heck was this, Amateur Night? This guy couldn&#8217;t find a mountain if he were sitting on it! It was <em>embarrassing</em>. I looked down, sure enough, there was his hand, trying not to feel me up like a $2 hooker. (Fortunately, I remain unviolated.) He must have glanced up and seen me looking down, as his hand darted back where I couldn&#8217;t see it.<br />
Entertaining as it was, the whole experience was still unsettling. There&#8217;s just something fundamentally wrong with having someone try to steal something from your person, and you catch them in the act. It&#8217;s actually nauseating.<br />
Though I wonder what would be worse &#8212; catching them, or not catching them.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><cite>[This entry originally posted on <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/">How To Get Lost</a>: <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/04/16-years-ago/">16 years ago&#8230;</a>.]</cite><br />
I had a phone chat with Alex this morning (it hasn&#8217;t been a week, and I miss her sorely; the next six weeks almost seem unfathomable), and she let me know something.<br />
I&#8217;ve gotten a little carried away saying &#8220;16 years ago&#8221;.<br />
<span id="more-524"></span>I mean, can I help it that half my life has passed in the last 16 years? That 16 years ago, I was in this same city, seeing the same sites as today, but different? A lot has happened in the 16 years, not just to me but also to this city. We still have Moscow to see, and 16 years ago it was most definitely a different city. (Kelly has told us much, including that Red Square is, sadly, closed due to national celebrations on the 9th &#8212; 16 years ago, it was closed, too, but for state reasons.)<br />
Sixteen years ago, I was 16 years old. Young, naive, seeing the &#8220;outside&#8221; world for the first time. Sixteen years ago, the world was a different place, too. Communism is gone from the former Soviet states &#8212; and the Soviet Union is now more of a joke. (As witnessed by a goofy-looking restaurant near here called &#8220;CCCP&#8221;.)<br />
I found myself standing in one of the rooms in the Hermitage yesterday, realizing that it was very different than the one I remember from 16 years ago. Spartan &#8212; a single large vase in the room, but the gold decor still intact. Memories of 16 years ago slammed into me like a hurricane &#8212; I actually felt younger.<br />
In a way, I still feel like I did 16 years ago. The world is new, and there is much to see. I think that 16 years ago, I was also a lot more bewildered &#8212; age has tempered that, and I am now more able to handle the experience. But I&#8217;m glad I came here 16 years ago. I wouldn&#8217;t have the appreciation for St. Petersburg now if I&#8217;d stayed away. In a way, though, it&#8217;s hard to believe that it was only 16 years ago &#8212; it seems a lifetime away.<br />
Hmm&#8230;<br />
Well, I figure those of you playing the &#8220;16 years ago&#8221; drinking game should be suitably plastered. On that note, I&#8217;ll try to refrain from writing &#8220;16 years ago&#8221; as much from now on. (That, and refraining from remarking &#8220;the last time I was here&#8230;&#8221; with Amy, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s sick of hearing it.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><cite>[This entry originally posted on <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/">How To Get Lost</a>: <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/03/visiting-the-hermitage/">Visiting the Hermitage</a>.]</cite><br />
The Hermitage is if not the largest art museum in the world, definitely in the top five. The place is MASSIVE. It makes the British Museum seem like a corner store by comparison. It doesn&#8217;t hurt, though, that it used to be the palace for the Romanov family (though opened to the public in the 1800s).<br />
After a fairly hearty Russian breakfast of bread, meat, and cheese (I&#8217;d forgotten how much I&#8217;d missed Russian cheese!), we headed out to the museum. Nord Hostel is about 100 metres from the site of <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/bloody-sunday-1905">Bloody Sunday</a>, between the Winter Palace and the Army headquarters. It&#8217;s a short walk to the museum&#8217;s doors.<br />
<span id="more-523"></span><a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03539.JPG" alt="Russian breakfast" width="300" /></a><br />
Despite a bit of confusion in getting our pre-purchased tickets (you can buy them online, but we&#8217;re not sure if there&#8217;s any real advantage), and with our new friend Nick along for the ride, we headed off into the museum spaces.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03540.JPG" alt="One of the lushly-appointed halls of the Hermitage" width="300" /></a><br />
The place has got to be several kilometres of hallways, and we walked most of them. It&#8217;s both quite a bit different than I remember, and still very similar. Some rooms were almost the same, but others had been stripped of many of the artefacts that had once graced the interior. (I can only assume this was due to a reallocation of the 15 million items in their collection, rather than theft or loss.)<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03541.JPG" alt="The large throneroom" width="300" /></a><br />
I am quite happy to have returned to the Hermitage 16 years after my first time through. Most 16 year-old boys don&#8217;t have the appreciation to understand what they&#8217;re looking at, so this time the art meant more to me. (Even if Amy got <em>very</em> tired of all the Flemish works &#8212; &#8220;too much Dutch!&#8221; was the word.)<br />
The other thing that&#8217;s changed a lot are the stores. There are kiosks selling books, a gift shop, and even an internet cafe. I&#8217;m sure that the Romanovs, buried not too far away at the Peter and Paul Cathedral, are rolling in their graves.<br />
We&#8217;ve done Day 1 of our pass through the Hermitage. We didn&#8217;t see it all, and we were moving pretty fast. Next time, we&#8217;ll be able to target things a bit more specifically.</p>

Taking the bus out to the Metro yesterday was a bit of an eyeopener. Things have really changed here in St. Petersburg in the last 16 years.<br />
New churches. Lots of them. In clusters, no less. Older ones have reopened. (Some as museums, having been converted back from potato storage depots!) They&#8217;re cleaned, and gorgeous.<br />
Cars. Sixteen years ago, most were Ladas (and the like), the imports were few and far between. Today, it&#8217;s almost the opposite. VWs, American cars, BMWs. SUVs haven&#8217;t really hit here yet, but I would imagine it won&#8217;t be long.<br />
Pop music was barely tolerated. Hip hop is common here, including the window-shattering bass speakers.<br />
Back then, you could spot us tourists very easily &#8212; we definitely didn&#8217;t look like the natives. Today, we practically blend right in.<br />
It&#8217;s going to be a few days until I get used to this&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p> Flew in Miami Beach BOAC,<br />
Didn&#8217;t get to sleep last night.<br />
All the way a paper bag was on my knee,<br />
Man, I had a dreadful flight.<br />
I&#8217;m back in the USSR!<br />
You don&#8217;t know how lucky you are, boy&#8230;<br />
Back in the USSR!<br />
<cite>The Beatles</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Didn&#8217;t really fly in from Miami Beach, though London certain seemed warm enough. BOAC is now British Airways. The flight was rather bumpy at times, but not to the point of air sickness. And it&#8217;s not the USSR anymore.<br />
But hey, the song still sounds cool.<br />
<span id="more-521"></span>Arrived more-or-less on time at St. Petersburg International Airport. It didn&#8217;t look much different from the plane than I remembered 16 years ago. The inside on the way to Customs was interesting &#8212; Soviet-era architecture was still present, overlaid with new capitalist offerings, especially high-end goods. (BMW ads look quite interesting in Russian.)<br />
Sixteen years ago, I remember being scared out of my wits as a Russian officer scrutinized my passport, looking up at me every few seconds, then returning to the passport. This went on for what seemed like an eternity (especially because he never said a word) before he stamped my passport and let me in.<br />
This time wasn&#8217;t much different. Except it was a woman. Not in a harsh uniform. In a much brighter space. She took less time. But she still didn&#8217;t say anything. Stamp-stamp, passport handed back, not a sausage beyond that. Go fig&#8230;<br />
Both of our bags arrived, thankfully. I think we&#8217;d have officially lost it had they not arrived. Unfortunately, the only thing that didn&#8217;t work out was the transfer to the hotel &#8212; the driver never showed up. After debating a while, we decided to take the bus to the Metro, and then downtown. Lest you think we figured this out on our own, we had a guide by the name of Daniel (or at least I think that&#8217;s what it was), an employee with Scandinavian Air who is very familiar with the process.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03535.JPG" alt="Amy and I trying to figure out how the heck to get from the airport to the hostel" width="300" /></a><br />
We arrived at the Nevsky Prospekt Metro station, dug out a map, and walked a few blocks to Nord Hostel, our home for the next few days. From the outside, it&#8217;s a mere sign on a door. The first thing you see is a well-worn staircase that you really don&#8217;t want to climb. It doesn&#8217;t look &#8220;right&#8221;. On the second floor is the hostel, and from there, things get good. It&#8217;s a simple place, but with enough ammenities that we&#8217;ll be fine.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03536.JPG" alt="It looks sketchy, but really isn't that bad" width="300" /></a><br />
Our room has six bunks, four of which appear to be occupied. The only roommate we&#8217;ve met is a guy by the name of Nick who hails from England, near Heathrow. He&#8217;s on a tour similar to ours, though considerably less planned. He&#8217;s doing this before he starts a Masters in September. Oh, to be a student again&#8230;<br />
The Russian adventure has begun. Time to go exploring.</p>
