		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890713.11</strong><br />
<em>Day 14</em><br />
We have just visited St. Issac&#8217;s Cathedral near the Neva. It is a very large cathedral, compared to others that we have seen. Established in the early to mid 1800&#8217;s, it is a younger cathedral but due to Nazi attack, it is one that has needed much restoration. The inside is very impressive. There is a ton of room and precious metals and stones line the walls and pillars. The outside still needs some work but it still looks fine. One of the most impressive things is that the entire building is set on hundreds of logs. Another is the pillars out front. They are about 100 ft. high and about 10 ft. wide and all one piece.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t give Pete or Shaun a wake up call that morning. I didn&#8217;t think they needed one. They didn&#8217;t, they were downstairs before me with their luggage. We checked out before breakfast, we would not be returning there for lunch. From there came breakfast at the restaurant &#8217;round the corner. It seemed I wasn&#8217;t the only one who had been bugged. The only difference was that Lisa V&#8217;s, Lisa P&#8217;s and Greg&#8217;s bugs were all cockroaches.<br />
I never saw any cockroaches in my room during my stay. I saw a couple of mosquitoes (both of which I squashed) and an ant or two. But no cockroaches. It was because of the cockroaches that we saw a major change in Lisa V. At the beginning of that trip, Lisa was akin to a nun (not quite, but damn close). Back then, she probably would have shied away from doing any harm. During our last night however, she nailed fifteen of the critters with her bare hands.<br />
After our final breakfast, we returned to the hotel to remove our bags from the lobby. As the whole group was present again, we needed two buses. We got a new one again. Most of us in the Circle headed right for it. We thought that might as well live it up while we still could.<br />
Even though we were leaving Leningrad that day, we still had some touring left to do. Our only historical site that day was St. Issac&#8217;s Cathedral, about a block or two from the Neva. As the bus was new, we knew we could rely on the tape deck. In went a cassette of the Doors. That was perhaps the first time I was formally introduced to that group. That trip in general was an introduction to groups I had never listened to before.<br />
From the outside, the cathedral didn&#8217;t look too good. In fact, it looked as if it had just been razed by fire. The surface was black and scaffolding was erected all over the place. Little did I know that renovations were still in progress and were likely to be that way for a couple years to come.<br />
As we were about to get off our guides informed us that at the cathedral, there was a charge to take pictures, another charge for flash pictures and an even higher charge for renting a camera. I only heard the renting prices and made the stupid mistake of leaving my camera in the bus. As we walked towards the entrance, we glanced back to see our bus driver dancing in his seat. We had left the Doors in the player.<br />
There was a guard who made us all line up single file (she had surprisingly excellent English) and told us to watch our step as we went in. I quickly found out what she meant went I tripped on a step on the way in. Fortunately, I regained my balance quickly. Two seconds later, I found myself wanting to run back out to our bus and get my camera. Although this was the umpteenth church we had seen in the Soviet Union, this was the first to really catch my attention.<br />
The interior volume was in my opinion, a little less than ten times that of any other church we had been in. Where the other churches may have used paint to make an impression, St. Issac&#8217;s used gold and semiprecious stones (some of which were found to be lethal to exposed skin, which was known only after several of the craftsmen mysteriously dropped dead).<br />
As in all the other cathedrals, there was the iconostasis above the altar. But this one was much larger than any other we had seen before. The cathedral hadn&#8217;t had a service in it since World War Two. During that time, the building had been razed by fire, bombed and shot at. Through a determined effort, it was restored to it&#8217;s former glory. They had only finished the inside when we were there, the outside was still being worked on.<br />
As the church was now a historical site, small stands with pictures and models depicting the original construction and the restoration. The models depicted the raising of the columns in front and the multitude of logs that the cathedral sat on. Since Leningrad was founded on swampland, the base for something as massive as a cathedral had to be very strong. Despite the fact that I neglected to bring my camera, I still remember St. Issac&#8217;s very well. This is because it left a very big impression on me, and probably the others too.<br />
What really shook me was an impromptu concert by a choir group. All of the sudden, they broke out in song. I never did find out what they were singing, but with the acoustics in there, it sent chills down my spine.<br />
I&#8217;ll try to explain the place, so you have an idea of what I&#8217;m talking about (this is because people usually don&#8217;t). The main chamber is over twenty metres high, with three smaller chambers lying to the northern, western and southern sides. Directly above the main chamber is a kind of cupola, which supplies most of the outdoor light.<br />
At the eastern end is the iconostasis, altar and the priest&#8217;s chambers. The priest&#8217;s chamber is a small room just beyond the iconostasis. The only way in from the cathedral&#8217;s vestibule is through two large doors the reside in the middle, under a painting of Jesus.<br />
Following a half hour or so of looking and talking (mostly to myself, my comments went unheard by others), I exited through the north side, gandered at the columns that supported part of the roof, and went back to my bus.<br />
The bus driver was still hopping in his seat, but I didn&#8217;t take note of what was playing. Several others had bailed out of the cathedral before me. Couldn&#8217;t blame them either, after two weeks of religious institutions, I was kind of surprised no-one went nuts or something.<br />
We bopped to the tunes over the P.A. system until our guides returned with the remainder of the group. Then we headed out for our final destination in the Soviet Union, aside from the airport.<br />
It&#8217;s supposedly the largest BS shop in the Soviet Union, but the one is Moscow still seemed a big bigger. But I think no-one really cared, it was our last shot at a store before we left. It was time to stock up on a few things. The store had four or six divisions (it was a small even number), and we had two hours to take our time going through all of them.<br />
I had a promise to live up to, so I spent the first few minutes tracking down the food section. I found Pepsi, loads of it. For now, I thought, I&#8217;ll check out the rest of the place. I ran into just about everyone as I hopped from room to room, carefully mauling over everything in sight. I did find something in one room that I really wanted &#8230; more pins.<br />
A large sectioned tray had been laid out with about twenty to thirty different ones. It took me about ten minutes to sort through them all. When I was done, I had a two huge handfuls of them. When I went to buy them at the cash register, I just beat another American student by about two seconds or so. But I let her go first, she had a lot less to buy than I did. I rang up a total of ten dollars (Canadian) worth of pins. I was almost shocked at the amount, but then again, I did take a lot of them too.<br />
Pepsi was the next thing on my list, I had to pay off the Suhs as I had promised (to this date, I haven&#8217;t gone back on one). I picked up three and was about to go for two more when I saw Helen (it might have been Mina, I had a hard time remembering who was who) and took two of hers.<br />
I paid for the Pepsi (obviously) and returned the two bottles to the Suhs. Just as I was about to leave, I realized I needed a bottle opener. I quickly turned to the cashier and asked her about an opener. Actually, I just motioned it, I doubted she spoke English. She then handed me one from a small stack. I said &#8220;thank you&#8221; (in Russian) and left. It wasn&#8217;t until I got outside that I noticed the price stamped on the back and realized that I was supposed to pay for it. As no-one was coming after me, I guessed that either they didn&#8217;t care or I was wrong.<br />
Returning to the bus, I dropped off my Pepsi and my pins, grabbed my camera and went over to the water&#8217;s edge. The BS shop was next to a rather large Intourist hotel (as I said earlier, the good Intourist hotels were the ones we didn&#8217;t stay in) and only a couple hundred metres from the Gulf of Finland.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t a lot to take photos of, but I did get a good shot comparing on old Intourist bus to a new one. After that, I returned my camera to the bus and hauled myself over to the lobby of the hotel next to us. We were told to meet there for lunch. Most of the adults were already there, talking to a couple who were in the midst of their own travels. A small stand near them attracted most of the younger people. There we found several things that we wanted. The best part was that the ruble was the only accepted currency. This was a big benefit for us, we could get rid of as many rubles as there were things for us to buy. I bought as many pins as I could before I ran out of cash. Not long after, the rest of the group began to show up. At that point, I remembered what Greg had told a few of us earlier in the trip: &#8220;If you see anything with Aeroflot on it, let me know!&#8221; I found an Aeroflot pin.<br />
However, I bought the last single pin. All the others were mixed with still more pins in special books. I wanted one of them, but I couldn&#8217;t afford it. Greg took a collection from a group of us and came up with just enough for a book, at which point everyone who chipped in snitched their pins. Greg got his Aeroflot pin.<br />
Then we found out that we weren&#8217;t eating lunch at the hotel as we had thought. We had to go back to the bus. So we got up and headed back to the bus. Most of us didn&#8217;t even get past the door though, it was raining, hard. A couple of us were daring (or just stupid) enough to run back to the bus. I forgot what happens when jeans get wet. By the time I got back to the bus, I was pretty wet, not soaked, just severely dampened. Of course, knowing my luck, the bus then started up and went over to the hotel to pick the others up. After everyone had boarded the bus again, we headed down the ramp (the hotel&#8217;s main door was raised so a ramp was used to get at it) and headed towards the heart of Leningrad again. It was probably the first time that we didn&#8217;t care that it was raining. Hell, after all, we were leaving so what did it matter to us?<br />
The semi-familiar sight of the airport soon came into view. Our time in Leningrad and the Soviet Union was drawing to a close. We pulled up to the International terminal and unloaded our baggage, which porters then took inside. But we didn&#8217;t follow, not yet. First we had a luncheon to attend to. This was one thing that no-one complained about, we were all hungry. We were led into an adjoining building, up a flight of stairs and down a hall into the restaurant.<br />
Radar, Marina, Jason, Suzanna and myself made up a table, and food did not last long on it. We went through two or three bottles of Pepsi and one bottle of mineral water (which tasted like carbonated sea water again). After about half an hour, Suzanna stood up and let us know that we should begin to go back to the terminal. Very few of us even moved. Mr. Phillips, Andrew, KB, two to three others and myself comprised the first batch.<br />
We entered the terminal and went over to the mass of luggage and tried to pick out which were ours. &#8216;Twas no easy task either. After finding them, the next part was to go over to the check-in counter and get our bags put away. We were flying Finnair on the way out, so not only we were assured of a safe flight, but the check-in clerks spoke English. It was getting better by the minute. One-by-one we hauled our bags up on the scale and weighed them in.<br />
Now unlike in most other places, they did not take our luggage there. I was about to walk off when they told me to take it over to another area, where several people were already lined up. They were having their bags checked. But not physically, they ran them through large X-ray machines. The guards didn&#8217;t look into the bags unless they saw something suspicious. The guy ahead of me (who wasn&#8217;t in our group) had evidently done just that, his bags were being picked apart with a fine toothed comb.<br />
At the sight of this, every horror story and film I had seen that had portrayed something to this manner suddenly whipped through my head. I broke into a cold sweat as the guy ahead was finally waved on. Following the actions of the guard, my carryon bag and my larger one went on the X-ray machine&#8217;s conveyor belt. But I handed my camera bag for him to check. Seconds later, I had my camera bag back, along with my other two that had gone through the X-ray machine. The guard had barely even glanced at them. I was beside myself. I could have smuggled a Lada out (not like I really would have wanted one).<br />
But I didn&#8217;t get a chance to stand beside me for very long, I was quickly followed by (and started following) Mr. Phillips into passport control. But we didn&#8217;t get very far. The guards there told us to drop off our larger bags onto another conveyor belt that would eventually get them on the plane.<br />
Then came, as I already said, passport control. All the guard did was remove the remaining half of my visa, stamp it and wave me on. In under five minutes, I had literally exited the Soviet Union. It took us twice that time just to get in. I was kind of disappointed that I had gone through so easily. I was virtually expecting them to search my things. Jason did as well, and as a result put all his dirty (and odorous) clothes at the very top. I felt sorry for the guard who would open his (I found out later that Jason had as little trouble as I did).<br />
There was only one obstacle left, but I wasn&#8217;t worried about it. The metal detector is the least of my worries, I was through that in under ten seconds. Beyond that was the waiting lounge. Roughly 75 metres long and twenty metres wide, it wasn&#8217;t exactly the greatest place to wait for our flight.<br />
At the far end of the rectangular lounge sat the last Russian store I would go in. A duty free shop. Those always come in handy. I finally got to give up my film budgeting when I found some rolls of 36 exposure 400 speed Fuji film, the stuff I had already been using.<br />
Slowly but surely, the rest of the group began to filter in. I began to notice a startling similarity between our departure there and our departure from Toronto almost two weeks earlier. Our group was taking it&#8217;s time and there were a lot of other people taking up a lot of the space.<br />
Then the worst happened, I was practically expecting it, our flight was delayed. The surprising part was that most of the people in our group were also expecting it. Even with all man&#8217;s technical achievements, they still can&#8217;t get a plane to take off on time. The strange part was that although we were delayed, no-one seemed uptight about it. Either we had gotten used to it, or didn&#8217;t care whether or not we were late getting into Helsinki.<br />
During our extended stay in the airport terminal, many people from our group made a trip to the duty free shop. One could find almost anything in there, despite its small size. Helen and Mina Suh, Kara Lynn, Tammy, Jamie and a couple of others all bought Sony Walkmans. One thing I will say for the Soviet Union, they really don&#8217;t care about profit. Those walkmans cost over two hundred dollars in Canada at the time. They got them for about ninety. I almost bought one myself. Jason however, could not afford one. But with my help, bought a cheaper one (by some company I had never heard of). This single purchase brought silent cheers from some of us, namely those Jason had been borrowing walkmans from.<br />
A small group consisting of Chris, Jeremy and Sasha (maybe another couple, but I didn&#8217;t see them) got their hands on guitars and the Russian version thereof and played to their hearts content.<br />
I spent my time setting the clocks on the Sony Walkmans for the Suhs and Kara Lynn. I don&#8217;t know why, but for some odd reason, most of the females I know are completely illiterate about electronics.<br />
Finally our plane was announced as boarding. At this news, almost every person in that lobby stood up and rushed to the door. It took a long time to finally get everyone out that door. We couldn&#8217;t all get out at one time, we had to wait for a bus to come, pick us up and haul us out to the plane.<br />
A sole Finnair DC9 sat out on the runway. All around it sat almost every imaginable type of military aircraft. Several of us wanted to whip out our cameras but we knew that if we tried, and a guard caught us, we wouldn&#8217;t see Canada for some time.<br />
Pretty well everyone in our group was seated in the rear of the plane (which made sense). I can&#8217;t remember who I was seated with, but it was a short flight anyway. I do know that I was on a window seat. Just as we were beginning to move out, Derek (a couple of seats back) began to quietly shout (how&#8217;s that for an oxymoron?) about something. A MiG fighter was taxiing out behind us. He quickly whipped out his camera and told everyone to make a simultaneous sneeze or cough to muffle the noise.<br />
The flight was a good one, all the preflight instructions were in English, something which I noticed that we didn&#8217;t get when we flew on Aeroflot. Of course, then again, Aeroflot had reportedly never crashed. That never comforted anyone. Then we began our time travel. We landed in Helsinki five minutes before we even left Leningrad. Sounds confusing doesn&#8217;t it? For those of you who don&#8217;t really know geography very well, there&#8217;s a time line between Leningrad and Helsinki (Helsinki&#8217;s an hour behind Leningrad) and the flight was 55 minutes.<br />
When we took to the air, I mumbled a final good bye in Russian (yeah I know it&#8217;s corny, but I&#8217;m telling the story!). On our way out, some of us on the right side of the plane noticed a Russian Bear (large Soviet bomber) &#8220;escorting&#8221; us out.<br />
Less than an hour later, we were landing in Helsinki on the same runway we had landed on the first time. Following the same routine that we had followed for the past two weeks in regards to airplanes, we had to wait for another bus to come pick us up. We all crammed ourselves on the bus (not all at one time, that would have been impossible), we were whisked across the tarmac to the same entrance we had gone through almost two weeks previous. As we were disembarking, I couldn&#8217;t resist saying..<br />
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this where we came in?&#8221; Talk about dÃ¯ ¿ ½ja vu.<br />
This time however, we weren&#8217;t going back upstairs to the terminal. We continued along the ground to passport control and luggage pickup. There were two distinct lines: one marked in red, for people who had things to declare and another marked green, for those who either didn&#8217;t have anything or those who didn&#8217;t want to declare it!<br />
Needless to say, we went through the green. I was kind of expecting a repeat of the treatment we got in Moscow. Was I surprised! All the guards (there were two or three in the booth) did was take a quick look at me, stamp my passport and bid welcome. No questions asked.<br />
Then came the fun part, finding our luggage. Some people (Mr. Phillips for one) never seemed to take long doing that. For some reason mine always takes awhile just to get off the plane. But I soon joined the others outside in the lower lobby. During our wait for the others, some of us who had accumulated went over to a bank stand (an actual teller) and exchanged their dollars (rubles are worthless everywhere, including the Soviet Union) into Finnish marks.<br />
When everyone had finally accumulated in our group, we headed outside to find our bus. For some reason, we all followed Radar. It felt a little weird as we normally followed our guides, KB or Mr. Phillips. But Radar seemed to know where he was going. My attention was temporarily lost though, as we walked through the parking lot. I nearly wept. I finally saw some real vehicles! Not shoeboxes on wheels but real cars like Beemers, Mercedes-Benzes, Saabs, Fords and the odd Jaguar!<br />
Our bus was an even greater surprise! We didn&#8217;t get something like the Russian buses we had used (not like we weren&#8217;t used to them), but we got a Eurobus! This was the true definition of coach! We threw our bags in the bus (no more porters) and quickly got on, to try and get the best seats. Those of us who were really fast got to the back of the bus, the best place.<br />
Greg, of course, was one of us along with Lisa V, Jason and myself. That was all I could see, I was on the window. Greg spotted the sunroof (sunroof?) just above him and stood on his seat to open it. He wanted to stay up there for the entire trip to the hotel.<br />
We began to pull out towards downtown Helsinki, where we would find our hotel, sleep, shopping and if we were lucky, McDonald&#8217;s! We all wanted to know where that was and even before we got out of the airport parking lot, someone (maybe even all of us) shouted &#8230;<br />
&#8220;WHERE&#8217;S THE MCDONALD&#8217;S?!?&#8221;<br />
Unfortunately, Suzanna didn&#8217;t know right off. But she did promise to find out for us as soon as she could. Well, it was better than nothing. Most of us were starving for something we readily recognized.<br />
On the beach at Sochi, a quick catching virus began amongst all of us. It was called the &#8220;WhatI&#8217;mGoing-toEatWhenIGetHome Fever&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t dangerous, just annoying as several people kept repeating themselves. Jason must have planned his out even before we left Canada. He wanted to make a beeline for Tim Horton&#8217;s to get, and I quote, &#8220;a coffee, black, no sugar or cream and a Boston Creme donut&#8221;. That&#8217;s how often he said it. Kelly Hogan wanted to hit every chicken joint she could think of. Didn&#8217;t blame her either, after two weeks of fish I could have gone for some poultry myself.<br />
As we entered the highway, one of Mr. Phillips&#8217; cassettes from his vast collection ended up in the tape deck. On it were tunes from the sixties and seventies. One of them practically became our tour theme &#8230; American Pie. Why? Beats me, I didn&#8217;t even like the song until then.<br />
Then suddenly, someone spotted something through the dense evergreens. A sign. A red sign. A red sign with a golden arch. Almost the entire bus jumped up and ran over to the left side to get a better view. It was only a McDonald&#8217;s highway sign, written in Finnish. Everyone sat down, kind of dejected that it was not a restaurant. Greg however didn&#8217;t. He grabbed Lisa V&#8217;s camera (still looped around her neck) and ran over to the window to take pictures of it.<br />
When we finally got into Helsinki, everyone went on a McDonald&#8217;s alert. Everyone (except the adults I should add) was trying to spot the arches and remember where they were. At first I was doing it too, but then I remembered a little known fact about Raunchy Ron&#8217;s: the only place you will see those huge arches is in North America. In Europe, those are considered too much of an eyesore. Even in downtown Quebec City, there are no arches despite the McDonald&#8217;s. All there that you see is a small dark green sign with bronze arches on them. And they&#8217;re hard to spot.<br />
After going down enough back streets, we finally arrived at our hotel, the name of which escapes me. Here we piled off and dragged out all our luggage. Then came the fun part, trying to get a room. We were told that it was four to a room. Pete, Shaun and myself spontaneously joined up. But they wouldn&#8217;t let us take a room without a fourth. Jason was still without a room, so I grabbed him. We really didn&#8217;t have much of a choice so there was only a quick argument on it. I won.<br />
We got our room, on the eighth floor of the eight floor hotel and headed for the first elevator. There were only three of them, two of them could only hold two people and the third was a service elevator, which could hold four. The elevators themselves were really awesome, they had no doors. It was a box, with the front and back open. You could see the walls move by as you went up.<br />
We were the only ones on that floor. Other than us, every room was empty. We found our room, and the double doors that they had (probably for security or something). We raced in and grabbed our beds. Shaun and I grabbed singles against the walls, Pete and Jason had the two beds that had been placed sidebyside.<br />
Before we did anything else we trashed the room. All the heavy covers were on the floor in a second, the lamp by Shaun&#8217;s bed was tipped over (gently), books scattered, etc. When we were finished, it looked like World War Three. We felt like we were at home. Despite my luck with the bed, I lost out on dibs for showers, I was last. But this gave me time to watch, of all things, The Flintstones on TV. The English was still there (English is a major language there) but there were Finnish subtitles underneath.<br />
As I was last for the shower, I made a quick decision to avoid dinner. When we found the map to guide us to McD&#8217;s (supplied by Suzanna), I knew what I was going to eat, and it wasn&#8217;t to be found at our hotel. Besides, by the time I got out, dinner was virtually over.<br />
A small group of us (Pete, Kelly B, Sonya, Shaun, Jamie and yours truly) took it to find the illusive home of the Big Mac. So we made a drunken beeline for it. I say drunken because we really didn&#8217;t figure it out right away. We quickly found ourselves kind of lost. We knew where we were, but we had no idea where McD&#8217;s was. Fortunately, we ran into a couple of Finnish girls who kind of gave us directions. But at least we knew we were going in the right direction.<br />
When we reached the next corner, we ran into Anita and group. She began to tell us that it had closed. She managed to convince Jamie, but not me. First off, if the McDonald&#8217;s around the world function the same way that they did North America, they wouldn&#8217;t close until about midnight. Second, my nose can sniff out a Filet O&#8217; Fish a mile away.<br />
So those of us who remained (all but Jamie) proceeded down a street perpendicular to the one we had come down. Sure enough, the green and bronze sign popped out from the wall. We had found our target. Just as we were about to enter, I got a sudden fear when I realized that the menu would probably be in Finnish. Luckily, my fears were for not, the signs (with a few exceptions) were in English.<br />
Then we all gave in to one huge Big Mac Attack! I ordered the most in the group (I was the only one not to have dinner at the hotel). My dinner consisted of a Big Mac, large fries, cheeseburger, milkshake and a sundae. It was expensive though, the total was the equivalent of fifteen dollars Canadian. But I didn&#8217;t care, it was food that I recognized and liked.<br />
As we sat, three of us got further nourishment with our eyes. Finland has some of the most beautiful women I had ever seen (aside from the girls on our trip of course there&#8217;s a suck up if I ever heard one). Pete, Shaun and I all went gaga. Shaun began chanting &#8220;dead puppies&#8221;. At first I had totally forgotten about that until Sonya asked what he was doing. Everyone else already knew, so we filled her in. From her expression on her face, I didn&#8217;t know if she was shocked or amused.<br />
About ten minutes after we had begun to eat Kim, Lisa P and Jason showed up. They ate considerably lighter than me. Jason had no cash left, so Kim paid for him. Nice of her wasn&#8217;t it? Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, say no more!<br />
Following our light to heavy dinner, our group headed out to explore the Helsinki night life, leaving Kim, Lisa P and Jason behind, they didn&#8217;t want to come. We found a designated crossover and headed to a large complex across the street. It was a huge commercial complex with stores, a Pizza Hut (if I had known about that, I would have skipped McD&#8217;s), and several bars. This interested Pete. In order to get near them, we had to get through a group of skate punks. Even Europe isn&#8217;t safe from the disease. And these idiots were a hundred times worse than those back in Canada. Their idea of art was the shoddiest job of graffiti I had ever seen in my life.<br />
We went up a set of stairs to the third or fourth level, where the bars were. Almost immediately, one of them caught Pete&#8217;s attention and we headed right for it. But before we had gone four steps, Pete stopped.<br />
&#8220;Uh oh, forget it, that dude&#8217;s too big!&#8221;<br />
Let me put it this way, the bouncer, the &#8220;dude&#8221; Pete was referring to, could have creamed Arnold Schwarzenegger with both arms tied behind his back. Now that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but then again, it has been a year since it happened! We avoided that one. At the next one, we not only found Chris, Konrad and Mike but we lost Pete and Kelly, who disappeared into its depths for about five minutes. I really didn&#8217;t feel like going in, I felt kind of sick. That&#8217;s the only problem with fast food, it sinks to the bottom of my stomach and solidifies.<br />
So when Pete came back out to drag everyone else in, I told them to have a good time and headed back for the hotel. The side of the complex we were on emptied out onto the street we had come up from the hotel. But that didn&#8217;t stop me from almost getting lost.<br />
I still can&#8217;t get over it. I got lost twice in two weeks. I never get lost. The last time I got lost was when I was five and couldn&#8217;t find my way out of a maze at Ontario Place. Even though I was several years older, the last thing I wanted to do was get lost in another city that I didn&#8217;t know, that little thought gave me the creeps.<br />
I never really got lost, I just got scared for a moment that I was. I quickly figured out what way to go. Soon, I found myself in my room, preparing for bed. I knew I couldn&#8217;t go to sleep however, I was the only one with a key and the doors were self locking. For about an hour, all I did was look out the window, write my journal entry (which is forthcoming) and watched some Australian movie. I had no idea what was going on, I came in at about the middle of it and got lost in the plot.<br />
Despite the fact that I was supposed to wait up for the others, I began to fall asleep. But just as I was about to drop off, a loud knocking came at the door. Opening it, I found myself face to face with Pete, Kelly, Kim, Jason, Sonya and Shaun. This was when I found out how expensive the drinks were. That&#8217;s why they came back, Pete was short on cash. So after five minutes, they left for the bar again, this time taking the key with them.<br />
Less than five minutes later, there was another knock at the door. Just as I was about to open the inner door, there were a bunch of them. I opened the inner door and was about to reach for the outer door&#8217;s handle but found myself looking at the others again.<br />
&#8220;Very funny.&#8221; I mumbled.<br />
They gave up on the bar. The drinks were too much and lights out wasn&#8217;t far off anyway. So in order to keep us interested until we fell asleep, we all grabbed positions in the room and talked. Shaun and I took our beds, Sonya took one of the two chairs, Pete and Kelly sat on Pete&#8217;s bed leaving Kim and Jason to unwind on Jason&#8217;s bed. Hint, hint, nudge, nudge, say no more! While we were talking, the subject somehow changed to Dead Baby jokes. Actually, it&#8217;s fairly simple. Normal jokes come around first, and then someone in the group has to come up with the infamous &#8220;Dead something&#8221; joke. In our case, it was Shaun.<br />
&#8220;Why do you put a baby in a blender feet first?&#8221; asked Shaun. We all knew the answer, but did not bother to say anything.<br />
&#8220;To see the expression on its face!!&#8221; continued Shaun, who then went &#8220;AHHHHH!&#8221; at the top of his lungs while simultaneously wrenching his face into an outrageous configuration that caused the rest of us to laugh ourselves silly.<br />
Now I know that sounds sick, the thought of it is kind of disgusting, but the way Shaun tells it is enough to make your sides split.<br />
Within fifteen minutes, Kelly was sound asleep. Not terribly surprising, we were all tired. But the rest of us didn&#8217;t stop talking. We yapped for quite a long time to, until a knock at the door came at about eleven.<br />
&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Jason.<br />
&#8220;Lights out!&#8221; came a muffled voice through the door. It sounded like KB. Everyone except Kelly sprang into action.<br />
&#8220;SHIT!&#8221; I whispered loudly.<br />
&#8220;HIDE!&#8221; whispered someone to the girls (they weren&#8217;t supposed to be in our room in the first place &#8212; another rule that we continued to ruthlessly break).<br />
&#8220;Turn the lights off!&#8221; whispered someone else. Jason and I made our way to the doors, opening them carefully. We lucked out that time, it wasn&#8217;t KB. IT was Mr. Hanson and Mr. Howard. I heard a few sighs of relief, one of which was mine, I think. I&#8217;m pretty sure that they knew that girls were in there, but I highly doubt that they cared. They knew that we were responsible (yeah, right!) and wouldn&#8217;t try anything. The only reason it was them was they knew that we were the only ones up there. They said good night and left.<br />
The lights remained out after that. Everyone, except poor Sonya (who was still in the chair) had reclined to a horizontal position. Kelly was still sound asleep and the rest of us were following fast. But being the pain in the ass that I was at the time, I couldn&#8217;t resist a picture. Focusing in the dark was hard, but I knew basically where I had to shoot. A couple of them heard the whine on my flash, but I denied hearing anything. Hee hee.<br />
FLASH! Everyone, except Kelly, started shouting at me. They were blinded, so was I for that matter, there was a mirror on the other wall that reflected some of the light. But that didn&#8217;t stop Shaun from trying to attack me with the lamp next to his bed. He didn&#8217;t get far (thank God), the cord was too short.<br />
Soon after, Kim decided to head for her own room so she could get in before everyone else fell asleep. Ten minutes later, Sonya dragged Kelly out of the room too, leaving just the four of us again. Pete, Jason and I however, could not sleep. We just kept talking. I mentioned that no-one was to clean up the room until I got a picture of it. One of my other two conscious roommates suggested getting one in the dark. Why not?<br />
I set the flash and self timer and the rest of us (except Shaun, who had told us to &#8220;f&#8211;k off!&#8221;) promptly crashed out in some unusual positions. Pete lumped himself in a chair, Jason draped the curtains over his head and I plopped on the bed, allowing myself to fall between the cracks.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
FINALLY!! Some REAL food! After arriving in Helsinki, Pete, Shaun, Jason and myself ran to our rooms and had a shower. While one took a shower, the rest of us watched The Flintstones in English (Finnish subtitles). Then we all went to McDonald&#8217;s were I ate too much (again!). Now I don&#8217;t mind Russian food, actually, I like most of it, but after a while, I could kill for a hamburger. Tomorrow is going to be a long day so I have returned to our room for some sleep while the rest party hardy.

		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890712.10</strong><br />
<em>Day 13</em><br />
WHERE THE HELL IS THE PEPSI?!? This question was asked many times last night and today. Everyone is thirsty and the BS shop doesn&#8217;t have any Pepsi. All they have is booze and tonic water. Soon I will be too desperate to care. At this moment, we are headed for Petrodvorets.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I forgot Jason wasn&#8217;t with me that night. It scared the hell of me for a second, but then I got my bearings again. I fumbled around for the alarm (which was driving me crazy with its incessant beeping) and turned it off. I was about to lay back and to some mental discussion as to what the hell I was doing in a Communist country (good timing there eh?) when I remembered that Pete and Shaun had asked me to wake them up, as they didn&#8217;t have an alarm between us.<br />
Pete and Shaun were in a room together. Think my prophecy of Derek and Pete taking a dislike for each other came true? At first I though so, but I was later informed that passports got mixed up and Derek ended up with Greg by accident. Although that was the beginning of a trend.<br />
I knocked on the door five times with my hand, and twice with my head (I usually do this with my sister). A couple seconds later, a weary Shaun was staring at me, probably wondering what I was doing.<br />
&#8220;Good morning, this is your seven o&#8217;clock alarm call!&#8221; I said cheerily. Shaun looked at me, then looked at Pete, then looked back at me.<br />
&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; he said, closing the door. I was expecting something a bit wittier than that, but after all, he had just got up.<br />
I was about to take a shower when I remembered the water. Our guides said it was safe so long as we keep our mouths closed and our eyes shut. No good for me. The next shower I would see was in Helsinki.<br />
I took a look out the window, hoping to see a decent day. Boy, was I fooled. It was Moscow all over again. The only good thing to come out of the weather that day was the fact that it didn&#8217;t rain. At about eight, we all grouped down in the lobby for breakfast. We expected to have a restaurant in the hotel, but were surprised to find that there wasn&#8217;t one. Our breakfast was awaiting us at a small restaurant just at the other end of our rather lengthy driveway.<br />
As usual, they had set off an area just for us, just as the other hotels had done (it made it easier to find a place to sit down and eat!). The cheese and salami were waiting. Then came the eggs (eggs and cheese combined) that was as usual, revolting. As a bit of a bonus, there were raisin buns. But few people ate them, mainly because of the way Lisa P described them..<br />
&#8220;These aren&#8217;t raisin buns, they&#8217;re cockroach buns!&#8221; she shouted. Just what we needed to hear first thing in the morning.<br />
After breakfast, we went directly to our buses. We had been warned of this and had brought down the stuff we were going to need. Unfortunately, we didn&#8217;t have the same buses that we had the day before, the blue and white Italian special wasn&#8217;t there. Our trip that morning took us to Petrodvorets, more commonly known as the site of the Summer Palace. It&#8217;s not far from Leningrad, but it still takes a while to get there.<br />
When Peter the Great founded St. Petersburg (the first name of Leningrad) back in the early 1700&#8217;s, he wanted a palace he could go to so that he could get away from the city, yet still be able to over look things. He had his palace erected in Petrodvorets. It&#8217;s the smallest of all the palaces but it&#8217;s also one of the nicest in my opinion. There isn&#8217;t a lot of junk kicking around. Very simple, that&#8217;s the way I like &#8217;em.<br />
When we arrived, the guide on our bus (who was much shorter than me, pretty nonetheless) instructed us to follow her and make sure that we didn&#8217;t loose her. This was good advice considering the large parking lot was filled with fifty or more tour buses. Not only that, but the entire complex as a whole was gigantic, and packed with people.<br />
A few minutes later, we were staring down the middle of the entire maze, looking right onto the Gulf of Finland. From where we were, I could see fountains, hundreds of them, all over the place. The palace grounds were studded with so many fountains that one would think that the ground would mud instead of soil.<br />
The strange part about the fountains is that not one of them has a pump. All the fountains are powered by the pull of gravity (how&#8217;s that for a contradiction?). The entire area is on a slope (although you really can&#8217;t see it) and the falling motion is enough to propel the water to heights as great as fifty feet.<br />
We then went down the staircase to the lower gardens, where all the fountains are. Our guide tried to explain something, but I didn&#8217;t hear her, I was too busy trying to keep us with all the people. It was then I saw why she wanted us to be careful. wall-to-wall tourists. We progressed down the walkway that ran on one side of the canal which also ran down the middle of the complex. When we got to the first bridge, our entire group flocked on for pictures. From the bridge, you can take a picture of the main palace from over the canal. The pictures that one takes from that position are almost identical to hundreds upon thousands of others, the bridge floor was worn where all the tourists had taken pictures.<br />
Then we disappeared into the forest. Scattered amongst the clearings are small buildings, more fountains, and the odd palace. It didn&#8217;t take us long to find Peter the Great&#8217;s old pad. The Romanovs had an unusual sense of humour. Of all the 144 fountains in the courtyard, there were three that were actually booby traps. The amazing part were all the boobies who couldn&#8217;t stay away from them!<br />
The first that we saw was one on the corner of Pete&#8217;s palace. It looks nothing more than a patch of small stones that were just scattered there. But along the edges are two rows of nozzles. Step on the wrong stones and you get soaked. There is a permanent wall of people around it laughing at other people dumb enough to get onto the patch.<br />
Not far up from that one was the most impressive fountain I saw. Even up close (as close as you can get without getting wet) the Oak Tree Fountain looks like a real oak tree, though it&#8217;s made entirely of metal. To make such a tree today would probably put you into the millions of dollars (not to mention stiff upkeep rates).<br />
In the same area as the Oak Tree Fountain was another of the booby trapped fountains. This was a larger version of the one we saw back at Pete&#8217;s palace, but it had the same effect. Step in the wrong place, and your socks get soggy (not to mention the rest of you). Just across the way was the last of the booby traps. But this one looked nothing like the previous two. This had a small circular deck with a post in the centre. On this post rested the roof, giving it the appearance of a merry-go-round minus the horses. I have no idea how this one worked (like I had an idea how the others worked!). If someone stands in the wrong place or too many people got on one side, there was a sudden rush of water from the edge of the roof. A wall of water all around the edge of the roof. If you tried to get out, you got wet. A couple from our group got on, and soon regretted that they had done so.<br />
Our tour of the lower gardens continued. We saw a fountain which looked more like an oversized chess board tipped on its side, but I didn&#8217;t ask our guide about it. I decided not to bother. We also saw dueling turtles. Not Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but two fountains that spat water (I think at each other, but I&#8217;m not sure, it wasn&#8217;t working at the time).<br />
I wanted to take a picture, but a quick examination of my film stock showed me that I had only a roll and a half of film left. Until I got some more, I had to be careful what I took pictures of. Unfortunately, not many Soviet stores stock Fuji film (the only film I liked using at the time).<br />
Soon, we were back at our bus, heading back for lunch. It took us some time to finally get everyone on, but soon we were on our way. Having two buses was a blast, I could easily bother Lisa V. She hated having her picture taken so all I had to do was point my camera at her when our bus pulled up next to theirs. After a while of just faking it, I did actually take one, but she ducked before the shutter opened.<br />
Our bus made a quick side trip on the way back, to get a good look at a cathedral that was fairly close to the Summer Palace. It was in the traditional Russian Orthodox style, and not in any of the tour books. So everyone on our bus rushed off, took a picture, and then rushed back on.<br />
Lunch was nothing out of the ordinary, aside from what we had to drink. We usually had two choices, one of which was often Pepsi. There was none here. Instead we had mineral water (that was the other usual) and what someone told me was Cabbage Beer. The mineral water in most places we had been was fairly good, but this stuff tasted like carbonated salt water. Despite my dislike of alcohol, I went for the beer. I had reached that point where I was too thirsty to care.<br />
Following our lunch, it was back to touring. Another afternoon, another palace. But this time we didn&#8217;t have to leave Leningrad to find it. Although today it goes by the name of Hermitage, it used to be known as the Winter Palace. It&#8217;s one of the largest art museums in the world. Hell, the museum itself is art.<br />
We had to go around the front of the palace and down a back alley to get to the Intourist entrance. It actually made quite a bit of sense to have an Intourist door separate from the conventional door, it would have taken us hours to get in had we gone in the front. As it was, the back door was much faster.<br />
While we were outside, it gave us a very good look at one of the most famous sites in the Soviet Union. It&#8217;s called Victory Square for a good reason. On a cold November night in 1917, a small group of group of Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, stormed the Winter Palace, claiming control of what was then Russia. Although it has been over-glorified into a storm of soldiers engaged in a gigantic life and death battle for supremacy, the overthrow was tame and quick.<br />
We finally got in after about a half hour wait. At first there really wasn&#8217;t much to see at all. It looked about as boring as the parliament buildings in Ottawa. But when we got to the top of the first set of stairs, hoo boy! Now that&#8217;s what I call a palace. I had never seen so much gold in all my life. I probably never will again. But it was impressive, noone could deny that!<br />
Although the tour took most of the afternoon, it was a quick tour, and we didn&#8217;t even get to all the rooms. There were few areas that didn&#8217;t have art on them somewhere. Some rooms didn&#8217;t have a lot in them, but that was because the room itself was more impressive than the art that it contained. If I meet an alien one day who wants to see samples from all the great masters, even the not-so-great, I&#8217;ll refer him to the Hermitage. If you can&#8217;t find at least one painting of a particular artist in there, whoever it is never painted that well.<br />
There are a few that I don&#8217;t remember seeing. Picasso for one. I think most of the artists in there didn&#8217;t do abstract. All the art in there is very much down to earth. Of course, I didn&#8217;t get to all the rooms, such as I have mentioned, so I could be wrong.<br />
The tour was pleasant, even though I&#8217;m not a real art lover. I think that for the most part, everyone else in the group liked it too. The only that I know that none of us liked, the heat. It was unbearably hot in there that day, although it was cool outside. I found it maybe a bit puzzling that they let it get that warm. There were no fire sprinklers, no extinguishers. Combine that with all those oil paintings, oh brother, do you have a fire hazard! The value of all that artwork must be incalculable.<br />
We finally ended our tour, but were advised to look around a bit more, if we wanted to. A small handful of us took a quick look in a couple rooms and then went outside to get some fresh air. We were outside for about a half hour before our bus drivers returned and we got back on. Then, of course, we headed back to the hotel.<br />
The tour left us with a bit of time left before dinner. A few people took off to parts unknown. Some people returned to trading. The locals were always around. Jason, Kim and myself tracked down something to drink. When we were in Sochi, Jason had bought a couple bottles of concentrated orange flavouring. We poured this into cans of tonic water. The initial taste wasn&#8217;t bad, but the aftertaste was a killer. It certainly wasn&#8217;t Old South.<br />
I stuck my nose into the bar next door, were I managed to find a real orange drink. I state drink, as it wasn&#8217;t juice of any kind, although it was much better than the orange flavoured tonic water. It got rid of the aftertaste, but we had to hang onto the bottles because the bartender wouldn&#8217;t let us pitch them in his garbage.<br />
I quickly found Pete and Shaun, who were engrossed in some serious discussions with some traders. I stuck my nose in to see what he was up to. Pepsi shirts. Whoopee. But at least they looked good, there were some really bad looking t-shirts that we traded for at one point or another.<br />
The three of us began to look around to see what else we could find. What we ran into were two of the most stunning Soviet women we had ever seen. Not a visible cavity or lost tooth, no lost hair. Perfect English to boot. They were offering lacquered boxes, among numerous other things. We were more interested in talking than anything else. I also suspected that they also did a few other services on the side that they didn&#8217;t normally advertise. Beautiful women in the Soviet Union seem to end up as prostitutes all too often.<br />
Our dinner time soon rolled around. It was the final one for us. We still had a breakfast and lunch to go, but that was the last evening meal we had there. It was typical for dinner, as far as dinners went, except for our dessert. When we were in Sochi, Mr. Findlay received the gift of a watermelon from a little girl and her mother (I assume he did something for them) and he was just so nice as to share it with all 46 of us. The sucker was so big, it went around without any problem at all.<br />
Following our dinner, we went over to the stairs in the front of our hotel for group picture time. I neglected to bring my camera though. It really didn&#8217;t matter, in all my shots I have at least one picture of each person on the trip. While we kept our places, people kept passing up their cameras for pictures. I thought of going up to get mine, but I decided against it. I could always get a reprint from someone else.<br />
I could have gone though. We had to wait a long time before we could start while Greg and Derek got their cameras. Wonder why it took them so long? The maids caught them when they went up. What did they do? Five minutes after they had gotten into the room, everything except the beds had been turned on its side.<br />
Just as the photo session ended, most of our group took off to parts unknown. The twenty or so of us left were informed that one last blast of cultural stuff was up. And it was mandatory that we go, no ifs, ands or buts about it. As there were only about twenty, we only needed one bus. But I did take my camera. I thought that it might prove to be interesting. Besides, I had high speed film in case there was a lack of light.<br />
So the twenty of us filed on to our bus and disappeared into the depths on Leningrad. We crossed a few bridges over some canals, then over one on the Neva to the north side. A few minutes later, we found ourselves among dozens of other buses. At this point, we stopped as we had arrived at our destination.<br />
The building didn&#8217;t look any different from the apartment buildings nearby, except for the ticket booth. We had to wait for a moment while Suzanna fixed something with the ticket agent, but then we went right in, through the very small lobby into the auditorium. Our seats were somewhere in the back, but the auditorium was small enough for us to be able to see quite well. When the lights went out, I was delighted that I had high speed film too. We were too far for a flash.<br />
The show was put on by a troupe of dancers from Siberia. They were all from the Siberian area (of course) and traveled all over the Soviet Union, much like a circus show. That was what some of their show was like too. During the show, some of us made some interesting observations. For example, one of the dancers looked an awful lot like Greg. Those of us who noticed that then noted that the reason that he wasn&#8217;t with us was that he was dancing in the show. In all reality, he was probably at some dance hall.<br />
I took a few pictures during the show (which turned out rather well too, I might add), but as I was still budgeting my film use, I kept it to a minimum. About fifteen minutes later, we were back at our hotel. As a reward for going to the show, we were given a later curfew, though I doubt any of us used it.<br />
We were soon trading again with the locals. I made a deal with the kid the night before for him to bring more pins. He did, and I traded off the rest of my bubble gum. All the pins I had traded for had prices stamped on the back, and after some quick conversions, I found that I had saved about $10. If the kid had been a few years older, I doubt I would have been so lucky.<br />
Shaun was going insane. It was probably the last time we would get to trade and he was determined to get his hands on as much military gear as he could. He was involved with the navy back in Canada, so his focus was on his Soviet counterparts. We was moving from trader to trader at such a speed I think the traders probably thought that Shaun was taking speed.<br />
Somewhere around eleven (I think, it was still very bright out) I retired to my room, for my last sleep in the Soviet Union. As I was listening to my Walkman, I noticed something rather odd. My Walkman has a nasty habit of buzzing when a radio (turned on of course) is nearby. It buzzed near my pillow, a chair and a section in the wall. I was tempted to find out why, but instead of shredding something, I just assumed I was being bugged and mumbled for a half hour.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
The Summer Palace was mind boggling with all those fountains (some of which were booby trapped). The Winter Palace (now formally known as the Hermitage) was even more impressive and very, very elaborate. Not to mention very, very warm.Tonight, some of us saw a really interesting dance troupe. It was more interesting that I originally thought it would be. Too bad not everyone came.

		<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 890711.18</strong><br />
<em>Day 12</em><br />
If you&#8217;re wondering what happened to Day 11, it was spent trying to figure what the hell happened to this journal. Two nights ago, I gave the journal to Greg the Wonder Dummy to have it marked. He supposedly gave it to KB but he never got it. It was a total waste of time. There was nothing happening but there was no curfew so just about everyone made a beeline for the Heinekin Bar, including me (no drinks though).<br />
Today was nothing special. But the BS shops have really got to work on their act. It took me two trips to get what I wanted. Well, time for dinner.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not remember much from Day 11, as far as my journal and my first version of this book goes, it&#8217;s part of Day 12. The morning of Day 11 was spent down at the beach of all places soaking up more rays. Beyond that, I&#8217;m not sure if anything special happened.<br />
When lunch rolled around, we were informed that we had to have our journals passed to either Greg or KB himself that day for marking. Yes, there were many feverish writers that day. I on the other hand was up to date and had no worries &#8230; yet. Before lunch ended, I sprinted up to my room, grabbed my journal (simultaneously lobbing a bun at my partially deceased roommate) and tore back down to the restaurant.<br />
Greg was still there, taking orders for t-shirts (which I was an order) and little rubber squeaky pigs. Don&#8217;t even ask! I didn&#8217;t want to find that out myself. Anyway, I gave him my journal. I should have told him &#8220;BE CAREFUL&#8221;. There had been nothing planned that day so I returned to the beach with the others. For awhile at least. I could feel the skin on my body become increasingly warm, even when it was covered. To an experienced sun burner, this was a good sign to cut out before it got any worse.<br />
When I returned to the room, I spent my time trying to get a hold of Greg. I not only wanted to find out if he found any shirts but if he had my journal. I didn&#8217;t know that he&#8217;d misplaced it yet, but I needed it. For some bizarre reason, KB decided that we were to have a talent show that night. Yes, we were to supply the talent. I can&#8217;t sing, dance or play an instrument. Reciting Monty Python never crossed my mind but I could write good poems. For that though, I needed my journal.<br />
That&#8217;s when I found out that Greg had lost it. Though Greg had said that he had given all the journals to KB, I knew that KB hadn&#8217;t lost it. Teachers don&#8217;t do that (usually). Greg had also failed to get me a t-shirt. It wasn&#8217;t really his fault, the store had run out, but I was in snotty mood anyway.<br />
While I was out on the porch doing God knows what, we got a knock on the door. As Jason was still comatose, I went to see who it was. None other than Mr. Phillips. He was personally passing a book around which we were going to give to Suzanna. It was a large book on Canada full of pictures. I signed it and we managed to get Jason to do so as well. Mr. Phillips was also taking a collection for Marina. Five rubles each was all he asked.<br />
I think Mr. Phillips was disappointed at Jason, for being sick. I&#8217;m almost positive that he linked to Jason&#8217;s drinking. I was going to explain that there were others who drank even more than Jason and were fine and chances were that it was food poisoning. But I didn&#8217;t.<br />
After a while, I went over to the TV. We had watched a bit from time to time, if any English bits came on or Gorby was on (that&#8217;s how I got my only photo of him). We flipped through all six channels until we came across something rather interesting. We must have timed it well, we found Red Heat, with Arnie Schwarzenegger himself. We came in just as it started. Throughout the film, except for the parts that were in Russian to begin with, there was a single man doing all the translation. The Soviets really have to work on their dubbing, we could still hear all the English in the background.<br />
That took us up right to dinner. Jason stayed behind though, he was still to ill to eat. At dinner, I noticed that Mr. Phillips and his entourage were not eating much. That&#8217;s when I found out that Mr. Phillips had spent more rubles buying eight or so whole roast chickens. He ate one by himself. So would I if I had the opportunity to eat one.<br />
Following dinner was, as scheduled, the talent show. For this we had to go to a Roman style building just up the hill from our hotel. It was easily within walking distance. But we didn&#8217;t go in. We just stayed on the stairs. Then the performances began.<br />
Jeremy had prepared a poem, which was quite humourous (I would have liked have done the same, but my journal was still in limbo). He&#8217;s the only other one besides a duo that stand out in my mind, I can&#8217;t remember the few who did preform. There weren&#8217;t many. The best group I think was the duo of Greg and Toni. Greg wore his Russian bicycling cap and a military jacket while Toni sported the matching hat. Why they wore them I&#8217;m not sure, but their little song was a riot.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Perestroika, perestroika,<br />
Glastnost too! Glastnost too!<br />
Gorby&#8217;s got a problem, Gorby&#8217;s got a problem,<br />
Lenin too, Lenin too.<br />
Perestroika, perestroika,<br />
Glastnost too! Glastnost too!<br />
Gorby&#8217;s got a funny head, Gorby&#8217;s got a funny head,<br />
and Lenin&#8217;s dead, Lenin&#8217;s dead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>These were the first two verses of their song, sung to the tune of &#8220;Frere Jacques&#8221;. The song itself was funny, but some Soviet guy who wanted to get in on the action made it even funnier. The guy walked up, and stood next to Greg, peering over his shoulder at the page that contained the lyrics. Then he took Greg&#8217;s hat and put it on. To top it off for a finale, Greg literally hopped in the guys arms. By this point, Toni was virtually in tears from laughing, as were most of us. But Greg did get his hat back.<br />
Then Mr. Phillips made his two presentations to Suzanna and Marina. Suzanna, as I had mentioned, received a book on Canada from all of us. Marina received a bonus, if you will. The average Soviet makes less than 200 rubles in a month. In one minute, Marina received 230. We didn&#8217;t let her refuse either.<br />
That night was a bit on the dull side. As there was no curfew that night, Greg had suggested that we have a Toga party on the beach. It never got any further than a suggestion though. Somehow I doubt that the hotel would have let us. Most of us ended up going to the Heinekin Bar on the C level. I ran into Sonya and Kelly in the elevator on my way down. But we also ran into a little trouble, to the tune of four rather larger German men.<br />
They paid no attention to me but immediately turned to face both Kelly and Sonya. I could feel their nervousness. Either that or I was nervous for them. Had anything come around, there would have been nothing I could have done. As much as I still practice the ancient art of Chivalry (no, it is not dead), I wouldn&#8217;t have lasted ten seconds up against those guys. When the elevator arrived at C level, the three of us got out as fast as we could. The Germans did not follow. A few steps more and we were in the bar. They don&#8217;t card you in the Soviet Union, I doubt they even care.<br />
I was one of a very small number of people (two I think) that drank no alcohol. I was there simply to talk with the others. I did not stay long, I kept getting the distinct feeling that I was not wanted there. I didn&#8217;t want to ruin any friendships that I had then, so to make life a little easier, I left for the Observation Level.<br />
I spent many of my evenings that way, alone. I felt alone for most of the latter half of the trip. I don&#8217;t know why, I just did. Almost like a void. I envied Greg, Derek and Pete for being lucky enough to have relationships during the trip.<br />
Despite the lack of curfew that evening, I turned in at 11:00. There was really no point for me staying awake any longer. Jason had beaten me to sleep again, but I wasn&#8217;t the least bit surprised. What I was surprised at was the fact that no-one stayed up late. Everyone turned in at &#8220;a reasonable hour&#8221;, which means before one in the morning. This I found interesting. For at the beginning of the trip, no-one wanted to go to bed early. Now no-one wanted to stay up late.</p>
<div class="entry">Day 12</div>
<p>Jason made a return from the living dead today, actually showing up for breakfast. I was a bit surprised that he didn&#8217;t get a standing ovation, but then again, just about everyone was deeply engrossed in breakfast, as were the two of us in a short time. Jason set a record eating his meal. If it had been a buffet, the table probably would have been emptied by Jason alone.<br />
Following breakfast, I got down to the serious task of buying souvenirs for not only me, but my family. I had promised them all something and was determined to get something fairly decent. I didn&#8217;t know when I was going to see a BS shop again so I used the one in the hotel. It wasn&#8217;t a bad shop at all, a bit larger than some of the others I had been in. I spent nearly an hour, but I managed to find something for everyone on my list.<br />
I found a pair of earrings for my sister that were had painted china beads on them. I tried to find a decorative plate for my mom, but had to settle for a spoon. My dad got a key chain with a thermometer in it. I know they sound cheap, but the prices were quite high in there. As I collected coins, I also bought a coins set of all the kopecks in circulation. Unfortunately, there wasn&#8217;t much in there that I could afford.<br />
It took me two trips though, the staff there wasn&#8217;t too swift. I then took my newly found treasures back up to our room where I was almost instantly confronted by a short Soviet woman, one of the maids. My towel had fallen off the railing on our balcony a couple days previous and I had to pay for it.<br />
Having gotten rid of her, Jason and I finished with our packing. Then, with great effort, hauled all our shit downstairs, where several of the others were waiting. A few minutes later, the buses (we finally got two of them) were loaded and we were on our way back to the airport. We traveled along the same route we had taken to get to our hotel and the sites were familiar, even though we had only seen them once before.<br />
We didn&#8217;t go directly to the airport, as I had thought we would, but headed along a road that went along the shore of the Black Sea. Here we found a restaurant, were we had lunch. It was a rather peculiar design or a restaurant. It was decked out in a Polynesian design, despite the fact it was in Russia. But the food was Russian, and there was no doubt about that one.<br />
After our filling lunch, we headed back outside and boarded our respective buses, making sure we got on the right one. Then we were on our way to the airport, about ten minutes away. When we arrived, our luggage was taken for us (as it was always) and we went into the terminal. But we didn&#8217;t stay in there long. Less than five minutes later, we were on another bus to take us over to the plane. I guess we were a bit late.<br />
As we were flying almost the width of European Russia, we needed a larger plane. There were also more people going. Because of that, our Aeroflot Ilyushin36 ended up being the long distance kind. It was more or less a cross between a 747 and a DC10. As this was an international plane, it had a higher landing gear. But we still boarded from the runway. Just behind the rear landing gear was a door that folded down from the fuselage to rest on the runway. We entered through the cargo section, climbed a set of permanent stairs to enter right into the cabin, where we took our seats.<br />
I guess our flight was carrying Leningrad children (Soviets often send their children away for the summer) because there were a bunch of them running around. I had a window seat so I didn&#8217;t have to worry about them. Radar on the other hand, a row up or so, spent time trading with them. The three hour flight was fairly uneventful. The flight was smooth (no in-flight meal either) and the landing, unlike a few others, almost flawless.<br />
But, as usual, we did not stop at the terminal. This time, we stopped no where near the terminal. We exited the same way we got on, but instead of following everyone else on the flight to a small glass building, our group hung around until everyone else had grouped together.<br />
Several of us took pictures of our plane. This was a definite no-no in the Soviet Union, and to top it all off, there were two guards nearby watching us. Now either Perestroika was really working or they were just plain lazy.<br />
We then entered the small glass building. The only thing inside was a pair of escalators, one up, one down. It turned out that the building was a hub used to space planes out more. So we went down to the walkway, which was a moving sidewalk. This took us to the main terminal, where we promptly made a quick exit, only to lose half the group again. Greg double backed to find the others while the rest of us waited.<br />
We continued along the outside of the terminal, occasional going inside the terminal and then coming back out, realizing it wasn&#8217;t what we were looking for. We finally found what we were looking for, the area our luggage was going to show up. Just up a staircase was a waiting lobby. There we found a bar where our group pretty well depleted the supply of Pepsi.<br />
We waited there for about an hour until our luggage came out. We collected it and made sure it was all there. But we didn&#8217;t leave yet. First, it was back upstairs to the lobby. Fifteen minutes later, we went into the restaurant adjacent to the lobby for dinner. It was an average dinner for us, including the fish. The food was average, the activities however were not. For starters, Lisa P was feeling a bit kleptomanic, wanting to take a plate, cup, glass and some silverware home with her. But she promised to bring it all back when she visited again (yeah, right!).<br />
Then Kim, Lisa, Jason and Mr. Phillips (everyone at my table except me) broke into verse. To be precise, American Pie. I never liked that song before the trip, since then, it&#8217;s been one of favorites. It was virtually our tour theme. I suppose that if I had gone on that trip two years later, I probably would&#8217;ve joined in, but I was way to insecure about my singing voice.<br />
Not long after, our buses finally showed up. As we were already downstairs, all we did was grab our bags and chose which bus to get on to. It wasn&#8217;t a hard choice. One was the standard bus, the other was a brand spanking new one, not a single colour matching the other. Of course, I grabbed the new one.<br />
We left the airport as we left everything, unceremoniously. We hit the highway and headed for the downtown core. It was a fairly long trip, along the way we saw nuclear power plants (long distance shot too I might add), Lenin shipyards and a few other historical monuments. Out of the skyline, we spotted our hotel. It didn&#8217;t look much different from the one we had in Kiev, but that was from the outside. We hopped off and grabbed our luggage. It wasn&#8217;t raining or anything, but we wanted to check out what we could find of the city while we still had light. We forgot the infamous &#8220;White Nights&#8221; that are typical of the northern region during the summer months.<br />
Then we lined up to try and get our rooms. This was when the next problem cropped up. There were only so many double rooms. The rest were all singles. Jason gave me his passport and I tried to get up as far in the line as possible. However, they ran out of rooms, doubles anyway. I ended up with a single. So taking my key, I made a hasty retreat with my luggage up to my floor. Once again, the elevators were a bit slow. In this hotel, I used the elevator as much as possible, and as far as I know, that&#8217;s all the girls ever used. The stairs were dimly lit and spooky as hell.<br />
Afterwards, almost all of us went out front to trade with the locals. You didn&#8217;t have to go far to get hit by one of them. A veteran trader can pick a tourist out at five hundred metres. Besides, it seemed that the traders had selected this as a common site to trade, there were almost as many traders as there were tourists. Just one tip to anyone who reads this and decides to go to the Soviet Union, take the price tags with you. Shaun tried to trade his $25 Batman shirt, but quickly changed his mind when the Soviets told us it was worth $4.<br />
Pins seem to go nice and cheap. There was this one kid, who couldn&#8217;t have been much older than eight who had a large bag of pins. For a decent sized bag of gum, I got every one of the pins that he had. Call it a hunch, but he was a beginner. Most experienced traders knew a fair bit of English, this kids hardly knew any. In time, he would probably become fairly fluent.<br />
Despite all I had learned of the Soviet&#8217;s great problem of drinking, I was a bit surprised when Mr. Phillips was unable to trade his Canadian scotch. The ironic part was that the guy he was trying to trade with was guzzling a bottle of vodka at the time. While we were working our way around the flock of youthful merchants, we happened to run into a group similar to ourselves. The only major difference was that they were from Alabama. All but one.<br />
He was almost the spokesperson for the group. As he was from Iowa, his accent was almost undetectable to us. All the others had those indicative southern accents. I like to listen to the accent (I don&#8217;t know exactly why), but sometimes I do find it hard to understand, especially if the person has an exceptionally strong accent.<br />
But you must realize, we didn&#8217;t bug them about the accent. As far as we were concerned, we had one too, providing you were looking from their perspective. One of them was warned not to speak despite this insight. It seemed he was from the hills of Alabama and had a very heavy accent. Chances were that this was the kind of accent we would have trouble understanding.<br />
We spent quite some time talking to them, comparing our escapades through the Soviet Union. Regardless of the reports that American students weren&#8217;t doing well academically, we found our American twins to be quite educated, except that they referred to Canada as the 51st state. We corrected them on that one. We probably would have talked to them longer, but they told us they were on their way home. We bid them safe passage and I headed for bed. Sleeping is not easily done in the northern areas on the world during the summer, it almost doesn&#8217;t get dark. Two to three hours of dusk is all you get.<br />
That was the least of my problems that night. I was dying of thirst. Just have a drink of water? Sorry, the water in Leningrad is worse than the water in Mexico. Thanks, but I didn&#8217;t want to get that sick at that point in time. To try and counter my thirst, I brushed my teeth. It worked, not as well as water but I wasn&#8217;t dying of thirst, not completely. But my luck was to improve when I went down to the lobby to sign in for the night.<br />
The Suhs were signing in as I got off the elevator. That&#8217;s when I remembered that they had bought five or six bottles of Pepsi at the airport. I raced over to them, nearly scaring them half to death. Desperate people often do rash things. I almost ended up my knees begging them for mercy. They only had one left, but they were willing to give it up. I promised to buy them two bottles at the BS shop the next day.<br />
Pepsi and AIM toothpaste do not mix well, but at least I wasn&#8217;t thirsty anymore. I owe the Suhs a lot for their generosity. If I hadn&#8217;t gotten anything to drink that night, who knows, I might have died of thirst. Okay, maybe that&#8217;s a bit over doing it, but when you&#8217;re that thirsty, you often tend to exaggerate things just a wee bit.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplemental</strong><br />
We got a brand new Intourist bus &#8230; IT RULED!!! On the way out, I was going to snap off a couple more shots of our Ilyushin 36, but I decided not to. After we got to our hotel (somewhere in Leningrad), most of us went out front and did some heavy duty trading. Something that struck me as odd was the fact that Mr. Phillips couldn&#8217;t unload his good scotch. Very strange indeed.Radar (with some of his shady underworld techniques and my seven bucks) scrounged up a bunch of Hard Rock Cafe t-shirts. At about 10:50, I split for bed, while dying of thirst but I ran into the Suhs (thank God!) and got a bottle of Pepsi off of them (God bless them!!!!) Almost forgot one thing. While we were trading, we met up with a group from Alabama. They were great, not at all like some of the Americans we know, the obnoxious type. Well, g&#8217;night Y&#8217;ALL!.
