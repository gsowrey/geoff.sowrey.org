										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Kiddo, today was a really fun day!<br />
Plans don&#8217;t always go according to plan, but there are those times when one plan ends up giving who new plans that are possibly even more fun than the original ones. I&#8217;d like to think today was like that, largely because we got to go somewhere fun, and I got to spend nearly the whole day with you! (Except for, y&#8217;know, when you were sleeping.)<br />
<span id="more-1458"></span>The big plan of the day was to attend Marisa&#8217;s birthday. You know her, she&#8217;s your friend &#8212; that&#8217;s Meranda&#8217;s daughter! So after getting ourselves all dolled up, we headed out for &#8230; breakfast. It&#8217;s Saturday, we always go out for breakfast. Today, it was the Marriott again for their buffet. It&#8217;s a tasty place, and it&#8217;s near the highway. One of the waitresses there tried to get you to say &#8220;agua&#8221; instead of &#8220;water&#8221;.<br />
If only she knew you only say &#8220;agua&#8221; and not &#8220;water&#8221;.<br />
After breakfast, we hopped on the highway and drove to <a href="http://www.parquediversiones.com/">Parque de Diversiones</a>, an amusement park just west of San José. We&#8217;d heard of the place before, and had hoped to go there before, but never had. (In fact, I had thought it to be little more than a park, and wasn&#8217;t aware what we were about to run into.) It wasn&#8217;t until we arrived in front of the parking lot that the light began to shine on what we were getting into.<br />
We parked and waited for Meranda to arrive so the party could begin. You were sound asleep at the time, so didn&#8217;t really notice the passage of time. You were asleep maybe 30 minutes in total, maybe about 20 of which we waited in the car amidst some spitting of rain.<br />
When we finally went in, it was just the three of us. The entrance confused and frustrated me, as even with our reasonably-okay read-Spanish, we couldn&#8217;t figure out what the heck we were supposed to pay to get in. As it turns out the park is a very interesting set-up &#8212; entrance is actually free. You pay only to go to on rides &#8230; and buy food, souvenirs, etc. So we sauntered right in.<br />
That&#8217;s when we found out that the party had effectively been cancelled. (Mommy called Meranda.) So our original plans became just for us. And on we wandered&#8230;<br />
We spent most of our time in an area known as the Pueblo Antiguo (&#8220;Old Town&#8221;), which is a representation of what San José was like back at the turn of the previous century. Most of it is reconstruction and doesn&#8217;t seem to feature original buildings (unlike Calgary&#8217;s Heritage Park), but it was still fun to wander around. There&#8217;s even a farm with chickens and cows and horses and turkeys and even a little train.<br />
Afterwards, we had a light snack while you played with the spouting frogs at the fountain.   You got mostly soaked. You also ate most of my sno-cone, and wouldn&#8217;t even touch the cotton candy! I mean, what kid doesn&#8217;t like cotton candy?!<br />
Sadly, we didn&#8217;t ride anything. We&#8217;d understood we could purchase more tickets inside, so had kept an eye out so we could ride the merry-go-round, or even the train. In all cases, we couldn&#8217;t find anything. But that was okay for us, we just enjoyed the walking around. It wasn&#8217;t insanely busy, either.<br />
The park isn&#8217;t huge, and it has a range of different rides. You&#8217;re way too small for most of these, though. It&#8217;s a little like Calaway Park back in Calgary, or an in-between to Centre Island and Canada&#8217;s Wonderland back in Ontario. One day, I hope you&#8217;ll see all of these. For now, this will have to do.<br />
We toured the park for about two and a half hours before it was clear that you were running out of steam (you tend to get hyper and distracted when you&#8217;re tired), so we opted to head back for home. It took longer for you to fall asleep than I&#8217;d thought &#8212; you didn&#8217;t actually pass out until we were in EscazÃº (and given the detour I took us on to get there, that was a good 20 minutes).<br />
Mommy and I ate a light lunch while you slept in the car. We parked right in front of the table (which was outside at Grau), so it was very easy to see you. You didn&#8217;t wake up until we left, but were asleep again moments later.<br />
Needless to say, we&#8217;ll be going back to Parque de Diversiones, and next time we&#8217;ll be definitely going on a few rides.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey kiddo,<br />
Today was Father&#8217;s Day. Not just here in Costa Rica, but in many other places around the world. Today was a special day in many ways, notably in that you and I got to spend a lot of time together (sadly, something we don&#8217;t get most days), and that you gave me a wonderful present: a photo of you, and a nicely-coloured picture of your favourite Sesame Street character &#8212; Elmo! (Even if Mommy had to help you. A lot.)<br />
You also gave me another wonderful gift: sleep. You let us sleep in a bit instead of getting us all up for 6:00 (or earlier).<br />
<span id="more-1405"></span>Mommy treated us to her special pancakes, made with cocoa powder. The were really yummy. You had three of them. (Along with a lot of papaya and pineapple.) After breakfast, Mommy and I showered while you played with our clock radio. I&#8217;m quite certain I&#8217;ll be getting up at 3:28 tomorrow morning to some strange radio station &#8230; though more likely the buzzer, with the volume cranked all the way up.<br />
Ready for the day, we all hopped in the car and drove into San José to spend some time in La Sabana park. The park is the largest urban park in Costa Rica (I think), and is very popular with people who live here. We&#8217;ve driven by it many times over the last year, but we&#8217;ve never actually gone into it before. That&#8217;s a real shame, as it is a really nice place.<br />
The Dos Piños company (the ones who make your favourite milk &#8212; the one that comes in the red Tetrapak container?) had a booth selling ice cream, and a bouncy castle. Mommy tried to get you to go inside, but you decided that the bigger kids in there were too much and (rather wisely) left before you got hurt.<br />
[flickr]photo:3648451450[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3648443988[/flickr]<br />
We walked along the lake, and saw some little horses go past. They were taking children for rides. You pointed at them and said &#8220;horse&#8221; (I believe it was actually &#8220;caballo&#8221; or something equivalent, anyway), and couldn&#8217;t stop staring at them. A foal (the baby horse) came right near us. You were rather mesmerised.<br />
[flickr]photo:3647641915[/flickr]<br />
One note I&#8217;m going to toss out here: your vocabulary is increasing daily. You&#8217;re getting very good at repeating things others say to you, including words in Spanish. In fact, you tend to say &#8220;yo&#8221; instead of &#8220;me&#8221; (you still won&#8217;t say your name), are quick to utter &#8220;si&#8221; instead of &#8220;yes&#8221;,  &#8220;vamos&#8221; in lieu of &#8220;let&#8217;s go&#8221; (though you do say &#8220;come&#8221;), and &#8220;agua&#8221; instead of &#8220;water&#8221;. You say both &#8220;jugo&#8221; and &#8220;juice&#8221;, but you&#8217;re still signing &#8220;milk&#8221; instead of saying them. But I digress&#8230;<br />
The horse rides were a mere six hundred colones (barely over a dollar), and we couldn&#8217;t help pass up the chance for you to go for a ride. Sadly, you would have nothing to do with the horse and all attempts were met with screaming. Maybe next time we should have you touch the horse first before we try to put you on one.<br />
[flickr]photo:3648451450[/flickr]<br />
Plopping you on my shoulders, we walked around the lake watching everyone spend their lazy Sunday enjoying the sun and the warmth. Some kids played in a spring that fed the lake, others fished for perch (I think they&#8217;re perch). Many others were playing football (what you&#8217;ll come to know as &#8220;soccer&#8221;) in one of the many fields that dot the park.<br />
[flickr]photo:3647651377[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3648462260[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3647663361[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3647669241[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3647676829[/flickr]<br />
In the shade of trees, we shared ice creams and you ate a small dish of Cheerios (one of your favourite snacks). That&#8217;s when we saw people actually zip-lining through the park. We&#8217;d seen the wires, but hadn&#8217;t thought them to be in use. It was almost comical to see them drift overhead.<br />
[flickr]photo:3649270124[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3648583884[/flickr]<br />
We headed home shortly afterwards. We ate the last of our pizza, and then you went for a nap. So did I, after I made the mistake of laying down &#8212; I had a long, hard week and it really took the wind out of me.<br />
Denise woke me up, thankfully, when she came to our door looking for help with her email password. We woke you up a little bit later, when Grandpa called. We had a problem with our connection with him, so he hung up &#8212; just as Nana called! We chatted with Nana for about 20 minutes before hanging up and calling Grandpa back.   You spent most of that time running around with your cart, my iPod, and your milk, all the time without wearing a diaper. We&#8217;re trying to potty train you now, and you&#8217;re slowly taking to the potty. But you prefer to run around without anything on.<br />
We went to Tandoori Palace for dinner, which had a surprising number of people there given that the three times I&#8217;ve gone to get dinner, there&#8217;s been hardly anyone there. At first we had the place to ourselves, but a family of eight arrived, then two more couples. But we had a fantastic dinner, and you tried a few new things like pakoras, lhassi, and jafrazzi.<br />
And watched a lot of the Bollywood movie clips they show on the TVs.<br />
You&#8217;re in bed now, after we played a bit more after getting home. You didn&#8217;t really want to go to bed at first, but you didn&#8217;t put up a single fuss. You almost never do.<br />
Thank you for today, my sweet darling. You make it feel like every day is Father&#8217;s Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can only stay around Santa Ana for so long before you start to feel a little caged in. And given that Alex and Mi Pequeña Niña are here all day, every day, there was a distinct need to explore a bit beyond our bounds. So Saturday morning (yes, I know this is a little late, I&#8217;ve intentionally been keeping away from my computer this weekend) we went off in search of adventure.  <br />
And butterflies.  <br />
<span id="more-1084"></span>This was Alex&#8217;s decision. I&#8217;ve suggested a lot, but Alex (presumably on a recommendation from her friend Rebecca, who lived in Costa Rica for a collective couple of years) suggested Saturday&#8217;s excursion. I hope to hear more desires of places to go (beyond &#8220;Arenal&#8221;, which I&#8217;ve heard a few times since we arrived in late July), as that&#8217;ll give us a good chance to see more of the country.  <br />
Anyhoo, Alex chose a placed called Spirogyra Butterfly Garden (the name is pronounced &#8220;spee-roh-HEE-ra&#8221; en Español), and we headed off around 10:00, effectively skipping MPN&#8217;s morning nap. (Though she did sleep a bit in the car on the way there.)  <br />
According to Google, Spirogrya is just north of La Sabana park, which didn&#8217;t take us long to get to. Well, the park didn&#8217;t take us long to get to. I neglected to realise that one cannot actually turn to the left to run down Avenida 4 from Calle 41 (for those of you in San Jose, that&#8217;s trying to turn onto the road at the north side of La Sabana from the road at the end side of La Sabana). If you go north of Avenida 4, you end up on Highway 1.  <br />
Not what I&#8217;d planned for.<br />
So after a 20-minute detour/return trip, we finally got back to Avenida 4, and turned down the road where<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=spirogyra+butterfly+garden&amp;sll=9.938417,-84.0903&amp;sspn=0.052163,0.058193&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.942982,-84.085064&amp;spn=0.052162,0.058193&amp;t=h&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=B"> Google had put Spirogyra on the map</a>. I was a little suspicious about a butterfly farm being there, but since it&#8217;s possible to have a factory right next to a neighbourhood (zoning doesn&#8217;t really seem to exist here), I wasn&#8217;t about to be one to challenge the wisdom of Google.  <br />
That said, Google was wrong.<br />
Leaving the neighbourhood, we ended up having to go around La Sabana to get ourselves back to Paseo Colon, cutting through the San Jose to get to Calle Central, which would take us north of the downtown, across the river, where we could scoot over towards El Pedro (an apparently defunct mall). But not far from turning onto Avenida Central (not the one right downtown, I should add &#8212; San Jose can be very confusing), we saw the sign for <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=9.940007,-84.072747&amp;spn=0.00326,0.003637&amp;t=h&amp;z=18&amp;msid=106619148814639590944.0004565abbf7a50d3a3c6">Spirogyra Mariposa JardÃƒ ­n</a>.  <br />
We were the only ones there. No-one else came during our 45-minute romp through a black netting-covered garden that was &#8230; well, not &#8220;filled&#8221; with butterflies, but there were certainly a number of them. A few even landed me on me, mistaking me apparently for a rotting log.  <br />
[Insert joke about lack of sexual prowess here.]<br />
Mi Pequeña Niña didn&#8217;t seem too particularly thrilled with the butterflies, at least not as much as I thought she&#8217;d be. Pretty much any animal, and she goes ga-ga until the animal is out of sight. Insects? Not so much.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s a nice place. Next time I go back, it&#8217;ll be with my SLR (at least once it&#8217;s working properly) to get all these wonderful things on film.  <br />
[flickr]photo:2838949976(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838957648(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838962534(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838134253(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838975040(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838149761(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838157243(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838164869(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838178969(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838183957(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2838189155(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
The cafe there was closed, so we decided to make a break for San Pedro Mall, on the east side of San Jose. In theory, not a long drive from Spirogyra.  <br />
In theory.  <br />
Also, in theory, the roads here are marked well enough that you can easily find your way without getting horribly lost. Which is precisely what happened to us. Well, not so much &#8220;horribly&#8221;, but definitely &#8220;lost&#8221;. My fault, I will state for the record, as I had incorrectly made a few assumptions about direction and distance, and believed that we would cross a highway that runs along the east side. Turns out we passed over said highway and ended up someplace completely different.  <br />
Like, I can&#8217;t even <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;saddr=Santa+Ana,+San+Jos%C3%A9,+San+Jos%C3%A9,+Costa+Rica&amp;daddr=Point+of+Lost+Return+%409.944382144667635,-84.01358842849731&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFT69lwAd7A3--g&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=9.944815,-84.013792&amp;sspn=0.00326,0.003637&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.944863,-84.013095&amp;spn=0.01304,0.014548&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">find the name of the area that we ended up in</a> kind of different. Oops.  <br />
Ironically, I had made not one, but two collosally bad turns. The first was not realising when I&#8217;d arrived at the #2 highway, which would have taken us to San Pedro. The second was turning left, not right, and driving AWAY from the San Pedro on a road that would have taken us TO San Pedro.  <br />
Methinks my internal compass is screwed up. Normally, I&#8217;m not this bad.  <br />
Finally arriving at San Pedro Mall, we went in search of lunch. The usual fast-food adorned the food court, including the ubiquitous Kentucky Fried Chicken, or KFC as it&#8217;s known here. KFC is a really weird phenomenon in Costa Rica. Apparently, so the story goes, it used to be really bad. Then some American guy came down, bought the chain, and overhauled the marketing. (If you ever think marketing isn&#8217;t useful, you clearly have never paid attention to its affects.) Now it&#8217;s the most successful one. Mark, Jason, and I have commented several times on quitting our jobs and opening a few KFCs &#8212; there&#8217;s always lineups at these things!<br />
Not wanting to eat any North American fast-food (I&#8217;m in a different country, darn it, I want something local), we went to Pollos Campaneros. Fried chicken. Tasted like KFC. Go figure.  <br />
Actually, the taste took me back to my last year of high school. In the summer, my friends and I (Stuart, Therese, Chris, James, Linda, Ali, Kathryn, Hil, Eva, and J) would go to <a href="http://www.canadaswonderland.com/">Canada&#8217;s Wonderland</a> for the day. The entire day. We&#8217;d be there when the park opened at 10:00, and leave when the park closed at 22:00. For lunch, we&#8217;d take buckets of cold KFC, which for some reason we were all completely fascinated with.  <br />
Good days, those.  <br />
The San Pedro Mall is kind of odd. It has some higher-end stores, but one end of the mall looks like a run-down outlet-type configuration. There&#8217;s even a place on the lowest level that sells (reasonably accurate) Rolex, Breitling, Hublot, and Omega knock-offs. The sweep isn&#8217;t quite right, but whatever. For $150, what do you expect?<br />
The route home I need to perfect a little better (there are faster routes through downtown), but it&#8217;s at least familiar. One of these days, though, I need to check out the fort in San Jose. It looks pretty neat, albeit totally devoid of tourists every time we&#8217;ve seen it.  <br />
This weekend coming up is another adventure. Where will this one take us? You&#8217;ll just have to wait and see&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might be wondering: Gee, Geoff, where are all the posts you had for Costa Rica? Well, it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want them up, it&#8217;s an issue of timing. I can&#8217;t really go into that right now, but let&#8217;s just say that this is the best way to have it for now.<br />
But on the bright side, there is more stuff to come shortly. Our month o&#8217; meetings continues as we head down to Panama [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5g2yyvdjrE">insert Van Halen here</a>] tomorrow for a client kick-off. This should be fun.<br />
First, though, let me recap our weekend just past.<br />
<span id="more-1011"></span>Friday night was another exploration for us. We&#8217;re still trying to figure out what all the local spots are, which ones are good and which ones we can skip. (Thursday night, after a meeting with Mama Luz &#8212; our realtor who has helped us so much in finding places to live &#8212; we&#8217;d found a place called &#8220;Bar Amigo&#8221;, which turned out to be a gringo place. It was okay &#8212; great hot dogs &#8212; but a place to visit rarely.) Across the road from Yakky&#8217;s was another restaurant/bar (they&#8217;re all restaurant/bars here) where we had a couple of drinks.<br />
[flickr]photo:2616702562(small)[/flickr]<br />
Realising that wasn&#8217;t the place we wanted to be, we shuffled out and drove back into downtown Santa Ana (which doesn&#8217;t have a &#8220;downtown&#8221; area, but it&#8217;s what most Westerners would associate with) to find a new place. The name I totally forget &#8212; yet we went back there on Sunday for the EuroCup final. It was more of a Tican place &#8212; menus in Spanish, and typÃƒ ­co food played heavily.<br />
I love Costa Rica for the seafood. I have not had such good seafood in a very long time. And it&#8217;s really inexpensive. (You can pay Western prices for seafood quite easily here, I should add. One of the reasons we&#8217;re looking around is to find where the locals eat, which is generally cheap and always tasty.) We even racked up a couple of pool games on tables that looked like they&#8217;d just been unwrapped.<br />
That&#8217;s when we met the owner, who&#8217;s name also escapes me. A tall, thin white guy from Vancouver, who felt that his life&#8217;s ambition was to open a bar. A business guy, no doubt by his demeanour, who really just wanted something simple to do with life. I&#8217;m really beginning to see the appeal.<br />
Mark and Jason decided that they just had to go clubbing. But I&#8217;m not the clubbing type. Never have been, and thankfully never will be. By that point, I was the sober one, so drove them to a club next to our temporary office space, and headed home.<br />
What happened to Mark and Jason, you ask? Well, I can&#8217;t speak for them. But let&#8217;s say that when I saw them the next morning, Mark had a big cup of coffee already in his hand, and the first word out of Jason&#8217;s mouth was: &#8220;COFFEE&#8221;.<br />
After a small desayuno at a small café in Escazu, we all headed into San José for something we wanted to do: check out the Central Market.<br />
The trip in wasn&#8217;t so bad. Thankfully due to two other runs into San José for meetings, we had a vague idea of where we were going. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find our way to the Central area. But we weren&#8217;t in any hurry, so Jason took us on a bit of a detour around the Central area before coming back in to find a place to park. Easier said than done, let me tell you. But we actually managed to find a place right behind the Teatro Nacional (National Theatre).<br />
[flickr]photo:2621711390(small)[/flickr]<br />
We wandered around the Square a bit before walking up and down Avenue Central, which is largely a pedestrian mall in the centre of the city. On Saturday, the place is packed. Not quite wall-to-wall people but it was certainly more people than I remembered from January 2005, when Alex and I did the same walk. Line ups were everywhere. We&#8217;d seen a huge one at the hospital just west of the Central area, and every single ATH (the Spanish acronym for ATM) had at least 15 people waiting. The money changing lines were even bigger. Apparently, this was the big day to go out.<br />
Reaching the eastern end of the pedestrian area, we double-backed and headed west. Mercado Central (the Central Market) was at the other end. Everywhere we walked, the street was dotted with cows. Not real cows, but statues of cows. Sculptures, really. Calgary had done the same thing about 5-6 years ago. The cows here are more plentiful in number (the Multiplaza in Escazu has at least a dozen of them) and far more decorated. Some are just downright hilarious.<br />
[flickr]photo:2621713340(small)[/flickr]<br />
Lots of people selling all sorts of things. While Mark might be able to pass for a Tico (if he didn&#8217;t dress so snazzy), Jason (being tall and blonde) and I (being dorky and not at all Tican) stick out quite easily. That means everyone running up to us offering &#8220;Ray Ban&#8221; sunglasses and &#8220;Rolex&#8221; watches. I was sooooo tempted to look at the Rolexes just to see what they looked like. But somehow, I managed to refrain. Next time, I&#8217;m giving these guys the gears. Fakes aren&#8217;t as easy to come across in Costa Rica as I&#8217;d thought, but it&#8217;s far from hidden.<br />
At the other end of the mall, we found the Mercado Central. Somehow, Alex and I had missed this when we were there. It&#8217;s an entire block of twisting hallways barely wide enough for a person to walk through with all the stores&#8217; wares bulging beyond their walls. It&#8217;s dark, it&#8217;s crowded, your senses are assaulted by unknown sounds and smells, and in some areas you&#8217;re straining to see through the dark. In short, it&#8217;s <em>awesome</em>.<br />
[flickr]photo:2621714542(small)[/flickr]<br />
We stumbled up to a little coffee shop in the north-east corner. Hopping up on three stools, we stared as the coffee roasted in an oven, pouring into a massive cooling bin. The smell of roasting coffee wafted about, overpowering the fish stalls about 20 feet away. Mark and Jason were in need of coffee. I still don&#8217;t drink it (I promise to document the event when it does happen), so endulged in a hot chocolate. Mark and Jason swear that it&#8217;s the best coffee that they&#8217;ve had &#8230; outside of Italy.<br />
[flickr]photo:2620893469(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2621719596(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620898829(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620901037(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620902469(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
(Mark has a pretty good theory: the Italians haven&#8217;t invented a lot of foods. They imported coffee, tomatoes, pasta, and rice from other cultures. But they perfected them. There&#8217;s a reason why Italians are noted for those things, because they got them exactly right.)<br />
The rest of the market unveiled treasures the likes of which are hard to imagine. This is not a tourist market. This is a working market. Yes, there are a crapload of tourists here, and there are a number of stalls that cater only to tourists. But go in deeply enough, and there are foods you don&#8217;t recognise, smells you can&#8217;t identify, and more than a few sounds that would be foreign in almost any market in Canada or the United States.<br />
[flickr]photo:2620904215(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620905907(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620907961(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620909845(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620911323(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2621735674(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2621737606(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620917647(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620919179(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2620922181(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Finding our rented car still intact, we headed back out of the city and over to Cariari to find a music store for Mark (he wants a guitar). Turns out the Cariari Mall is quite the dive. We didn&#8217;t stay long, desiring to go to Escazu instead. Stepping outside, a good clap of thunder told us the sunny part of the day was officially over. By the time we got to the Multiplaza, we were in the midst of the heaviest rain we&#8217;ve seen since arriving. Outside for maybe 10 seconds (between the car and the mall entrance), we got a good soaking. The rain lasted over an hour and half.<br />
[flickr]photo:2621746892(small)[/flickr]<br />
Saturday night was a quiet one. I ate at home, though we all went out in search of something to do beyond bars. A bowling alley, or something. Movies here are limited, and <em>Wall-E</em> isn&#8217;t out yet. We ended up at Yakky&#8217;s again. Mark and Jason ate. I talked.<br />
On Sunday, Mark and I went into the office to access the internet. I feel bad about thieving internet at the apartment, and the signal hasn&#8217;t been reliable the previous few days. When all you have is a small blurry video and scratchy audio to see your wife and child, you&#8217;re willing to spend time in an office to see them. Sadly, they were out.<br />
Just before 13:00, we were back at the bar we&#8217;d found on Friday night, seated at a table in clear view of a big screen TV, watching the live broadcast of the Spain vs. Germany final game of the EuroCup 2008 series. I honestly expected more people to be in the bar, but I could also hear people in their homes not far away, too. Football here is popular (not American Football, which is what Canada and United States prefer to watch), and I&#8217;d heard &#8220;second only to religion&#8221;. Admittedly, I&#8217;m not sure how true that is.<br />
[flickr]photo:2624479679(small)[/flickr]<br />
It was a great game, though. Well-played, even if it there was only one goal.<br />
It started to rain as we drove home after a quick stop at the Auto Mercado for some things around the house. And it rained for the next 4-5 hours &#8212; a rarity here. Rain usually lasts at most an hour. But it did make for a nice cool night.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week was a rough one. It&#8217;s almost hard to believe we&#8217;ve only been here a week now. (A week ago right now, I was in the lobby of our hotel, chatting with Jason and Javier, waiting for our realtors to come and whisk us away to our condos.) Since then we&#8217;ve gotten our places, bought the things we need to make life reasonable (note: not &#8220;comfortable&#8221; &#8212; we&#8217;re still working on that), moved into a temporary office, got connected (still need cell phones), started working on new work, and had a surprising number of meetings given that there&#8217;s only four of us.<br />
So when we got to the end of the week, we had pretty much declared ourselves &#8220;beat&#8221;. Had we been a lot more set up than we are now, we&#8217;d probably have just gone home to our respective places, kicked back, and relaxed. But it&#8217;s hard to do that when you have to flag down a cab. Which you can&#8217;t here, for some reason.<br />
We rented a car instead.<br />
<span id="more-1010"></span>Sooner or later, you have to decide when enough is enough. Spending hours (I&#8217;m not joking, by the way) waiting for a taxi is not fun. While they&#8217;re fairly inexpensive (rarely more than a couple of dollars), it&#8217;s a colossal waste of time. As we&#8217;re all Type A people, it&#8217;s beyond frustrating.<br />
For the record, Jason wants to be a rally driver. I&#8217;m certain of this. We&#8217;ve got some dinky white Nissan that I swear could be foot-powered for all the oomph it has. But in Jason&#8217;s hands, that think could handle the Paris-Dakar race. On Sunday, we were exploring old Escazu, and Jason was whipping up and down roads like it was a marked course. No problems at all. This guy has adapted to Costa Rican driving.<br />
[flickr]photo:2603884205(small)[/flickr]<br />
Our first task with the car? Shopping.<br />
Yes, this was our wild Friday night. We went to the nearby Mas Por Menos (&#8220;More for Less&#8221;) store for various odds-and-ends that we&#8217;re all missing. I didn&#8217;t get much (I don&#8217;t want to get much; Alex and I are aiming for a more minimalist existence), but Mark filled a shopping cart.<br />
[flickr]photo:2603881365(small)[/flickr]<br />
After that, we went out in search of dinner. We searched for a Tican restaurant (we&#8217;ve done <em>gringo</em> to death) and found a place called Yakky&#8217;s. Kind of a dive, but by 21:00 the place was packed. The food was great, the beer was cheap (Imperial is the Costa Rican favourite, and it&#8217;s about $1 a bottle &#8212; markups are really small here). For the three of us, it was only $60 with a lot of food, several beers, and Mark and Jason endulged in a little JD. I drove us home.<br />
[flickr]photo:2603882479(small)[/flickr]<br />
Saturday was a trip into Escazu for some shopping. We were aiming for a place we thought was called &#8220;Se Marco&#8221; (turned out it was &#8220;cemaco&#8221;, which is a name of a department store ala The Bay). We found a box store called EPA, which is mostly a home improvement place. Mark loaded another shopping cart. Jason got keys cut for our office space, and we all got slop buckets and mops so we can actually clean our places. The cat hair in mine (Asia&#8217;s shedding like crazy) is getting out of hand.<br />
We found our way to Grau, a local chain of coffee shops. I still don&#8217;t drink coffee (I imagine it won&#8217;t be long before I do), but Jason and Mark were dying for one. I settled for a pineapple smoothie. It&#8217;s called a &#8220;batido&#8221;, which directly translates to &#8220;beaten&#8221;. Mixed with milk. Mmmmmm.<br />
[flickr]photo:2603885915(small)[/flickr]<br />
A trip to the mall found the real &#8220;cemaco&#8221;, and also the times for the English showing of <em>The Hulk</em> that we saw that night. (I have to say, a surprisingly good movie.) Not far from there was Aliss, another store that has a massive baby section that Alex will love.<br />
All the while, I should point out, Mark was searching for a french press so he could make coffee. This was almost an exercise in futility. French presses aren&#8217;t common here (yet). Unlike in North America, where you can about trip over all the Bodums, they&#8217;re a rarity even in the gringo centres. I kept telling Mark that he needed <a href="http://www.zurqui.com/crinfocus/cr/coffee.html">the Costa Rican method of making coffee</a>, but couldn&#8217;t remember the damn name of it (Chorreador de café), nor easily find it.<br />
Something I noticed as we went from store to store to store. The Euro Cup was playing on virtually every set. Everywhere we went, eyes were glued to sets. Football (&#8220;soccer&#8221; to us heathen North Americans) is second in importance only to the church. I think it even eclipses family when it comes to certain games. You really need to pull a sales guy away from the game to get his (or her, but they&#8217;re usually male) attention.<br />
We ate lunch in likely the last Chichi&#8217;s restaurant on Planet Earth. Might have been the prototype, too. Despite the disappointment in realising it was a restaurant chain, it was actually pretty good. Possibly the best fajitas I&#8217;ve had, actually.<br />
Sunday was notably quieter, with really only our excursion into old Escazu being a notable point. In fact, Ihad to work on a priority item for the Toronto office. It is nice to be wanted, though. Tricky part is the lack of connectivity at home, still. Weak internet means no phone or means of communication with the outside world. It&#8217;s a bit of a nuisance, admittedly. But slowly, adjusting.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tropical depression in the north of the country has created our weather woes of the last few days, and a heck of a downpour this morning.<br />
Following our usual breakfast run, Joaquin arrived to pick the three of us up at 8:30 to take us downtown to the CIS / Rapp Collins office to interview candidates for our new office. We had a lot of people on the list, and we all knew it was going to be a long day.<br />
<span id="more-979"></span>The ride down was interesting, because it continues to shed a little more light on the places we&#8217;ll be seeing over the next couple of years. Also, we passed by the hotel Alex and I had stayed in two years earlier. Surprisingly enough, I&#8217;m finding it easier to gain my bearings. I always thought I&#8217;d need a GPS to survive here, but perhaps I won&#8217;t do so badly&#8230;<br />
I joke, of course.<br />
We met Paul, one of our partners, at the office when we arrived. Paul reminds me of someone, but I&#8217;ll be darned if I can remember who. We chatted briefly, were handed binders of resumes for the people we&#8217;re about to interview, and we got down to the task of prepping for what was going to be a long set of sessions.<br />
Jason had it the &#8220;worst&#8221; of all of us, with 11 people to interview, each almost an hour in length. Mark was the lightest at five. I came in around eight, with two people going to Jason (as they&#8217;d wanted to be project managers).<br />
It was a learning experience for me as well. Over the course of interviews, my eyes were opened to a few things about technology in Costa Rica:</p>
<ul>
<li>The universities teach process very well. This includes extensive UML background, Rational Rose, and PowerBuilder. This is stuff you rarely see on resumes back home.</li>
<li>Microsoft is common. Even if someone doesn&#8217;t know .NET, they&#8217;ve worked with ASP.</li>
<li>Schooling is extensive almost across the board. You don&#8217;t see many wholly self-taught people here.</li>
<li>Costa Rican CVs (resumes) provide a lot of information that is effectively banned in North America, such as:
<ul>
<li>Date of birth</li>
<li>Place of birth</li>
<li>Marital status</li>
<li>ID number</li>
<li>Citizenship (and visa status)</li>
<li>Sex (male or female, duh!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cafe Britt (a very well-known Costa Rican coffee company) doesn&#8217;t actually make coffee anymore. They&#8217;ve effectively become just a marketing company. Alex is going to be disappointed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interviewing without the ability to actually discuss is hard. Mi español es muy malo, so I needed Paul to translate some of my questions. That also meant I had to tone down the technology in some of the questions, looking instead to see how these guys thought. (And yes, they were all guys. The sausage party never ends.) It also meant I couldn&#8217;t use the interview guides well, since the language barrier proved to be a bigger problem.<br />
We broke for lunch around 13:00, zipping just a bit down the block to Luka&#8217;s, a very Tican restaurant. Simple, but oh-so-good. And discovered for absolute fact that Coca-Cola in Costa Rica is excellent. It&#8217;s original. Coke up north was changed years ago to use high-fructose corn syrup. The change ruined the flavour and it&#8217;s never been the same since. In Costa Rica, they still use the old method, making the taste with sugar. Apparently, even Coke Light tastes good. I&#8217;ll have to try that tomorrow.<br />
After lunch, we resumed the interviews. Mark ended up sitting around, however, as he&#8217;d run through the gamut of people in the morning. I was done by 17:00, but we ended up waiting for Jason until almost 19:30.<br />
Like I said, it&#8217;s been a long day.<br />
Tomorrow won&#8217;t be so long, as we&#8217;re first going to our new office space. It&#8217;s empty at the moment, but it&#8217;ll give us an idea of what the space will be. What happens after that is anyone&#8217;s guess. I gather I need to be in a meeting to discuss our infrastructure, but that&#8217;s about all I know right now.<br />
Two more sleeps until I can see my family again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I knew today was going to be awkward when I woke up. Based on the conversation I&#8217;d had with Alex last night, none of the houses we&#8217;d seen on Day 1 were at all suitable. Either way too large, in not-so-nice areas (e.g. you&#8217;d feel like you couldn&#8217;t go anywhere), or had stairs (which we&#8217;re trying to avoid with our almost-walking infant).<br />
When Luz Elena and Lina Maria arrived this morning, I took their carefully crafted plan, opened the window, and tossed it out. (Figuratively speaking, of course.)<br />
It was time to get a little more serious.<br />
<span id="more-977"></span>Although we headed off almost right away, there were a lot of rapid phone calls as Luz Elena tried to pin down some different places to see. Still, we went to some they&#8217;d had planned because they weren&#8217;t really that far off the mark.<br />
The first one really didn&#8217;t sit well with me. Although cheap, it felt like I was living in a prison. And by &#8220;cheap&#8221;, that&#8217;s in gringo prices. Down here, you can get cheap. And it&#8217;s CHEAP, with all the connotations that come along with it. We gringos are accustomed to certain things, for which we are required to pay through the nose. We bring in the money, and we have to pay it out. Fair trade, all things considered.<br />

On the way to the next place, a series of phone calls suggested that both Mark and Jason were interested in it as well, an apartment in Santa Ana. I immediately thought that I should throw my hat into the ring as well &#8212; for no other reason than just to be a pest.<br />
When we got there, Mark was just leaving to see another unit in the same complex. It was a very modern apartment, but it felt closed in, to me. Maybe it was the curtains, or the fact that when you looked out the window, all you saw was the other row of buildings. After a few minutes, Mark and his realtor came back in, followed by Jason and his realtor a few minutes later.<br />

We scooted back through Lindora, hanging a right about a click past the strip malls (yes, there are strip malls in Costa Rica now &#8212; civilisation is officially over), into a place called Rincon del Sol. A very nice two-level unit (yes, stairs, which are bad) that really stood out for appeal. But the neighbourhood felt cold &#8212; I didn&#8217;t see anyone on the streets, and all the driveways had barricades (common in Costa Rica).<br />

Scooting back into Escazu for the last place, we came to an apartment block. By this time, I was fairly disheartened about the whole affair. I wasn&#8217;t going to find the &#8220;perfect&#8221; place. They don&#8217;t exist here. Not with the requirements I have. This place was nice, including a very modern-looking apartment and a pretty killer view over Escazu and the mountains.<br />
[flickr]photo:2530584657(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2531401628(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2530587053(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Lunch was at a place in Lindora called &#8220;La Mar&#8221;. Seafood. Damn good seafood. Octopus should never be cooked that well &#8212; it&#8217;ll make me not want to eat anything else. I actually didn&#8217;t taste last night&#8217;s dinner any longer (thankfully). But make no mistake, I was depressed. What was I going to do?<br />
Luz Elena and Lina Maria dropped me back at the hotel afterwards &#8220;to rest&#8221; (read email, catch up with people, make phone calls), while they arranged more showings for the afternoon. They know the pressure I&#8217;m under.<br />
At 15:15, I jumped back in their car, and we went off to the Avalon Country Club, which I&#8217;d heard of from Mark. It&#8217;s not a &#8220;country club&#8221; in the way that most North Americans know them. This is a walled garden, with condo units inside. There&#8217;s a &#8220;lago&#8221; (pond, really), 25m olympic-style pool, gym, tennis courts, football (soccer) field, lounge pool with a SWIM UP BAR (*cough*), and over four kilometres of trails to walk around.<br />
Colour me stunned. And the unit comes furnished.<br />

It&#8217;s not cheap. But the unit costs less than our mortgage back in Calgary. That&#8217;s not too shabby, really.<br />
The last place I saw was the closest one to the office, not far from the Marriott. It&#8217;s nice, but isolated, without really anything near it at all. You have to drive just to see another house outside the complex. That pretty much discounted it.<br />
[flickr]photo:2530590195(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2530592211(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
I talked with Alex tonight, and I&#8217;m going back to Avalon tomorrow. I&#8217;ve got some questions that need to be answered, and with any luck we can get all this squared away tomorrow. It&#8217;ll be nice to go back to Calgary knowing that I don&#8217;t have to worry about a place to live when I get back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oy.<br />
It&#8217;s been a really long day. Didn&#8217;t sleep great last night (long travels tend to do that to me if I&#8217;m not traversing a dozen or so timezones, in which case passing out is a snap). Got up early thanks to the engine retarders on passing trucks (there is no bylaw against them here, and truckers seem to use them to slow down, say &#8220;hello&#8221;, accelerate, turn right or left, order coffee, etc.) and a bit of excitement.<br />
Did a couple of Spanish lessons on Rosetta Stone before and after breakfast, when we met with our Crown Relocations team. One for each of Mark and Jason, but I scored a mother/daughter team (Luz Elena and Lina Maria) to help me find a house for my family.<br />
<span id="more-975"></span>The goal isn&#8217;t just to find a place to live. It was also to show us around so we know where things are. As it turns out, I was fully able to get my bearings, to the point where I could successfully navigate through a number of places without too much difficulty. I think. It helps to have an idea of where you are. I could even plot them in Google Earth, which I&#8217;m using to communicate locations with Alex.<br />
&#8216;Bout near died and went to heaven with the first place &#8212; a 450 sq. metre (4,800+ sq. ft) pad that happened to be right next door to the brother of Costa Rica&#8217;s President. Wild. It was getting some touch-ups, but was generally gorgeous.<br />
[flickr]photo:2531350168(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2530535331(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Second place was nice, too. The communal pool might as well been from a tropical resort. Oh, wait. We are in a tropical resort. I keep forgetting that. You&#8217;d think all these palm trees would clue me in.<br />
[flickr]photo:2530535471(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2531352916(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Broke for lunch in Escazu. I find it no end of ironic that I had to go to Costa Rica to find an excellent Italian pannini. There&#8217;s just something wrong with that.<br />
Third place was a bit of a hole, sadly. Not at all what I wanted, and was pretty sure Alex wouldn&#8217;t want it either.<br />
[flickr]photo:2531355516(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2531354170(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Fourth place was better, but it felt like I was in Tuscany. The bad part about being in Tuscany &#8212; too many people you don&#8217;t know/never see, and nothing else around you. I&#8217;m at work all day, so we have to make sure this works for Alex.<br />
[flickr]photo:2531357444(thumbnail)[/flickr][flickr]photo:2531358752(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
At dinner Jason, Mark, and I all talked about our experiences of the day. It seems the realtors for Mark and Jason are more experienced. Could also be that my requirements are just that much more difficult to find. Jason&#8217;s almost pinned down a place. After talking with Alex, we&#8217;re not even close.<br />
Ate way too much for dinner. Absolutely great food (Azteca soup and a &#8220;platter of meat&#8221;, which was pork, black beans, guacamole, and tortillas). Beer went down way too easily (I&#8217;m going to like Imperial).<br />
Maybe with luck, we&#8217;ll find a place tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago, I used to think business travel was glamourous. You got to go to far-flung places, see different things, and engage in activities you just don&#8217;t do at home. Then I started going on business trips. I learned fast that the enjoyment is only so deep.<br />
Worst experience was [[Live from Cincinnati|Cincinnati in 2000]]. Second, and only because I was utterly exhausted by the end (the trip itself was very helpful) was [[Je suis en Paris!|Paris in 2006]]. (As I learned, when you travel to Europe, you end up with 18-20 hour days, because you&#8217;re trying to stay sync&#8217;d with the home office.)<br />
But today hasn&#8217;t exactly been a slice, either. And just because I&#8217;m currently in Costa Rica <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Santa+Ana,+San+Jos%C3%A9,+Costa+Rica&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=2&amp;geocode=0,9.933607,-84.184196&amp;t=h&amp;ll=9.945418,-84.189987&amp;spn=0.002859,0.003659&amp;z=18&amp;iwloc=addr">doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m sitting on a beach</a>.<br />
<span id="more-974"></span>I woke up at 3:50. That&#8217;s AM, as in &#8220;before most sane people wake up&#8221;. I was at Jason&#8217;s house by 4:30. We were at the airport by 5:00. Along with &#8212; it seemed &#8212; all the Japanese tourists in Canada. Very strange. Check in, customs, security, and wait for the flight.<br />
Roughly four hours to Houston. And then a six hour wait. There are no direct flights from Calgary to San Jose, Costa Rica. You have to fly through somewhere. And with costs being what they are, that means Houston. There are worse places to be stuck for six hours, but frankly, any six-hour stint in an airport is enough to drive you batty.<br />
About 45 minutes before our flight boarded, we met up with Mark. Mark&#8217;s day has been considerably easier, as he didn&#8217;t have to wait nearly as long. Flights from Chicago are much more reasonable. The three of us boarded our flight to San Jose &#8212; another 3.25 hour journey.<br />
I should point out by this point that it was 18:15, and I&#8217;d been up quite a lot longer than I&#8217;d like, and wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly happy about the next leg of the trip. I wanted a nap. Badly.<br />
The flight, like the one before it, had a few bumpy parts (especially the landing &#8212; I was certain the pilot had blown out one of the tires), iffy food (we were actually fed, though), and not-so-great movies (or more importantly, they weren&#8217;t ones I wanted to watch).<br />
But it was on that flight that it hit me. The announcements were no longer in just English. Now I heard Español, too. I need to learn Spanish. It sounds weird, but this all sounded fine on paper sitting comfortably 5,000 kilometres to the north. But here, now, sitting in my hotel room, this is something different.<br />
Tengo que hablar Español. Especially if I have any hope of survival.<br />
Anyway&#8230;<br />
Arrival (bumps aside) was easy. Going to the States on business merits proctological examination. Here, we could have brought in an entire company and no-one would have been the wiser. In typical Tican form, we were immediately hit upon by a guy willing to take us to his hotel. Disappointed that we already had reservations elsewhere, he still drove us. For $6 each. Probably a bit on the expensive side, but we&#8217;re here, and that&#8217;s all that matters.<br />
Tomorrow, we house-hunt. This should be interesting&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s funny the number of people who now ask me if they can come with us to Costa Rica. They congratulate me and make it sound like it&#8217;s going to be fun, sand, and cervesa all the time.<br />
News flash, folks &#8212; we ain&#8217;t working on a beach. We&#8217;re not even close. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=costa+rica&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.981235,-84.144888&amp;spn=0.005706,0.008905&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">This is where our office is/will be.</a> Note the extreme lack of nearby sand and water.<br />
It&#8217;s the Metro Free Trade Zone Business Park, a mere 5 minutes from the airport. The nearest (decent) beach is 5 hours away over very bad roads (and drivers that would scare the pants of 99% of North American drivers). Yes, we&#8217;re closer than Calgary.<br />
But not <em>that </em>close.</p>
