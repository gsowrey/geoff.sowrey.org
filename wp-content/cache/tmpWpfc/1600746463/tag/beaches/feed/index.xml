										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year past was one of the toughest ones I can remember. It&#8217;s been a year of extreme highs, some pretty darks depths; my share of awesome joys, mixed with an unhealthy dose of stress. And that&#8217;s not when you consider the economy, I might add &#8212; things are even worse when you roll all that in.<br />
The year closed out on a more sombre note for me, in many ways. Much quieter, and I got to spend a lot of time with my family (which I cherish now, and cannot regret in anyway), but the future is a little less certain. I&#8217;m less concerned about that fact than I thought I would be, however.<br />
On with the year that just was&#8230;<span id="more-2500"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Rang in the new year watching fireworks go off all over the Central Valley in Costa Rica (a spectacular sight, if you ever happen to be in Costa Rica at New Year&#8217;s)</li>
<li>Had numerous run-ins with illness between The Monkey, myself, and Alex (and some far less pretty than others, lemme tell ya!)</li>
<li>Experienced my first, bonafide, scare-the-crap-outta-me earthquake, measuring in at 6.2 at its epicentre</li>
<li>In Costa Rica, travelled to:
<ul>
<li>Villa Blanca (Los Angeles Cloud Forest), three times</li>
<li>Arenal (for my very wet birthday)</li>
<li>Parque de Diversiones</li>
<li>Playa del Coco</li>
<li>Playa Hermosa</li>
<li>Playa Chiquita</li>
<li>Puerto Viejo</li>
<li>La Paz Waterfalls</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Had a few troubles with our trusty Suzuki, Dave, and spent more than a few bucks getting &#8217;em all fixed</li>
<li>Managed to avoid becoming totally addicted to coffee, but still drank a lot of it</li>
<li>Took pride in The Monkey starting school (yes, even though she wasn&#8217;t even 2 years old yet)</li>
<li>Worked through the challenges of getting a startup business up and running; the stress took its toll on me and my family, and likely all lead to where I am at this very moment</li>
<li>Travelled to Canada for a visa run, though it was originally planned as a family visit:
<ul>
<li>Barrie</li>
<li>Bolton</li>
<li>Oakville</li>
<li>And wee bit of Toronto (I had to go into the Toronto office) just for flavour</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Saw far too few sunsets on beaches</li>
<li>Discovered great Indian food in Costa Rica</li>
<li>Moved from our first apartment to a new apartment, after our condo management company couldn&#8217;t come to an agreement on a contract extension</li>
<li>Got utterly screwed by the aforementioned condo management company, to the tune of about USD$1,500</li>
<li>Celebrated 20 years of journalling/blogging with post #1,000 (total coincidence, I swear!)</li>
<li>Did a Stampede-style breakfast for my co-workers</li>
<li>Finally acquired my Temporary Residency visa &#8230; after realising that staying in Costa Rica long-term wasn&#8217;t an option for my family, and we&#8217;d decided to go home</li>
<li>Waxed poetic on management and management style (perhaps too much so?)</li>
<li>Cringed as The Monkey crossed into &#8220;The Terrible Twos&#8221; (which, thankfully, haven&#8217;t really been that bad)</li>
<li>Finally snapped after running into a &#8220;Perfect Storm&#8221; of difficult project, dealing with the relocation company, organising the family, trying to sell the car, cancelling services, and making sure that what little money we had saved was properly moved out of the country before we left &#8212; I was an utter wreck at the end</li>
<li>Ate far too many of our last meals in Costa Rica in a Denny&#8217;s</li>
<li>Managed to survive the 19-hour ordeal of moving from Costa Rica; flying through Houston with a few bags, an irate cat in a bag, and a toddler hell-bent on doing her own thing; finally arriving in -18 degree weather in Calgary after 22:30 at night</li>
<li>Moved back into a house we hadn&#8217;t seen in a year and a half, finding things we hadn&#8217;t seen in probably over three years</li>
<li>Bought a 2006 Jetta TDI</li>
<li>Critical Mass and I parted ways after about 9.75 years</li>
<li>Landed a wonderful case of Benign Positional Vertigo on Boxing Day</li>
<li>Realised that, yes, there are many things that Costa Rica has better than Canada &#8230; beyond the weather</li>
<li>Rang in the new year year to come with a visit to the Calgary Zoo&#8217;s &#8220;Zoo Year&#8217;s Eve&#8221;, at -22 degrees Celsius</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m missing easily a couple of months&#8217; of detail in there, but the simple fact is that most of Q1 and Q2 last year were chaotic, busy, and stressful. I&#8217;m proud of what we all achieved, and I miss the people I left behind in Costa Rica. Time changes, and people have to change with them. As such, 2010 will be a year of change for me. I don&#8217;t see that as a bad thing, just that as with any human, change ain&#8217;t easy.<br />
But change <em>is</em> exciting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Monkey! Almost a year and a quarter ago, I brought you and Mommy so we could all be together here in Costa Rica. In that time, we&#8217;ve had the opportunity to do some travelling, but until this past week, we hadn&#8217;t ever been to the Caribbean side of the country. It was kind of a major check mark we needed to cover.<br />
We&#8217;ve been to the Pacific side a few times now, and we&#8217;ve done the &#8220;middle&#8221; parts in between, even just a little. (Sadly, we&#8217;ll probably not be able to do the more southern parts. Or see pretty much anything else, if my job ends up being the way it&#8217;s looking.) It would have been pretty silly not to see at least both coasts.<br />
And with our impending departure in a couple of months, we were running out of time to do it.<br />
<span id="more-2186"></span>Last week was a short work week, and I managed to steal four days away from work so we could hit the sand and jungle. Mommy and I went through dozens of different places to see and stay, and finally decided on a place called Playa Chiquita. (&#8220;Chiquita&#8221;, for the record, has nothing to do with <a href="http://www.chiquita.com/">the banana</a>. It&#8217;s Spanish for &#8220;petite&#8221;. Which is pretty apt &#8212; Playa Chiquita ain&#8217;t that big.)<br />
We packed enough things for four days: Tuesday through Friday, and hit the road. (We&#8217;d wanted to leave earlier, originally, but we had a Thanksgiving Day event with the Canadian Club on Sunday, and Mommy wasn&#8217;t feeling very well on Monday.) It turned out to be for the best, as I think if we&#8217;d tried to stay a sixth day, Mommy or I would have officially gone a little crazy. (You won&#8217;t remember this, but there are a lot of biting bugs on the Caribbean side.)<br />
The drive from Santa Ana &#8212; where we live &#8212; to the Caribbean coast is an odd one. Although it is surprisingly easy, far easier than driving to the Pacific coast, it takes quite some time. Partly because once you leave San José, the Highway 36 travels to the north before bending east through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braulio_Carrillo_National_Park">Braulio Carrillo National Park</a> &#8212; a windy road that must climb and descend a few hundred metres in its course. The road is, at least, two-laned for the uphill portions, unlike the Highway 1 through the mountains to Puntarenas.<br />
But from the Park to the coast is still over 100 kilometres away. A short drive in Canada, maybe, but even on what I would consider to be the best long-distance road I&#8217;ve driven in this country, it still took two hours to reach the port city of LÃ­mon. The worst part about the drive was just all the produce trucks.<br />
East of the Central Valley is prime agricultural land. While I doubt it&#8217;s what gave Costa Rica its name, it&#8217;s certainly a major part of Costa Rica&#8217;s economy. Out there are endless fields of pineapple and banana plantations.<br />
As far as I know, most of them are owned by either the Chiquita Brands company (formerly known as United Fruit) or Dole Foods (a result of various mergers and renamings, but contains the former Standard Fruit Company). Neither have a particularly good humanitarian history, and are largely responsible for the term &#8220;banana republic&#8221;. These companies &#8212; or companies like them (I&#8217;m unclear as to which it is) &#8212; have a tendency to worry about their crops first, and anything else second. Including those people who work the fields. Spraying pesticides from planes while workers were in the fields, and children were in company-run schools was still common only a few years ago.<br />
We drove south from LÃ­mon until we got to a small town called Beverly, at which point I accidentally zigged when I should have zagged. (I blame the long-knocked-over road signs.) Thankfully, Mommy got us back on the right south heading south.<br />
The coastal road to Puerto Viejo wasn&#8217;t too bad. A little bumpier, but relatively easy. About five or six kilometres short of Puerto Viejo? Gravel. And it&#8217;s like that for most of the road south to the Panama border, although oddly broken up by paved sections that are often heavily pot-holed. All-in-all, it was just shy of five hours to get to Tierra del Sueños, our cabina for the first three nights.<br />
Tierra del Sueños is a little eight cabin hideaway carved out of the Playa Chiquita jungle, run by a pair of young Gringos, Angie and Brendan. They run a simple place about 200 metres from the beach (you have to walk down the road, and then along a narrow path through the jungle to get to it) that has little more than a bed, running water, and electric lights. Everything else is pretty basic. It was a really nice change from some of the places we&#8217;ve stayed before.<br />
Dinner that night was at a place just down the road called Jungle Love, also owned and run by gringos (we would find out that most of Playa Chiquita seems to be inhabited by ex-pats from many countries). Although a bit pricey, the meal was fantastic, and because we were the only ones there for the first little while, we got quite a lot of attention.<br />
It began to rain not long after we got back. And not a little rain &#8212; we&#8217;re talking Caribbean coast downpour. And as we found out, our aluminium roof not only shielded us from the rain, but also made an otherwise lovely sound of rain-on-roof turn into a tremendous racket. That night, you also slept on a big bed with Mommy &#8212; I slept on a mattress on the floor. I didn&#8217;t sleep, and neither did Mommy. You slept like a rock.<br />
Howler monkeys woke us up the next morning before 5:00. We struggled to try sleep some more, but you would have none of it, of course. (Something about your tree-borne cousins, I can only presume.) With the rain having stopped, the only &#8220;reasonable&#8221; thing to do before breakfast (at 8:00) was to walk to the beach. We didn&#8217;t go to swim, just to look. The rain returned as we returned to the cabin.<br />
At breakfast, we had a conversation with Angie and Brendan, while you got introduced to their two dogs, Cody and Ginger. (You LOVED being licked by Ginger, and I think as a result Ginger followed us a lot.) They suggested we go on a chocolate tour that afternoon, which sounded like a great idea, presuming the rain stopped by then.<br />
With all the rain, there wasn&#8217;t a lot to do, so I took you into Puerto Viejo for a look-see. Despite being after 10:00 in the morning, very little was open. You were asleep even before we got into town, and remained asleep until we were back at the cabina parking. We had a snack at La Casa Del Pan&#8217;s Playa Chiquita location, where we would also have lunch with Mommy. (I ate far, far too much that day.)<br />
After lunch, we drove the short distance to ChocoRart, an organic craft cacao plantation that offers tours (on reservation only, which Angie was very kind to arrange for us). We were met at the parking lot, led up a hill and past a stand of bamboo to wait in a &#8230; well, it looked like less-dense jungle. There we waited until our guide, Marcus &#8212; also ChocoRart&#8217;s owner and operator &#8212; came to meet us. He came armed with a machete and a long staff with a hooked end that sort of looked like a flattened metal rubber duck.<br />
He gave us a brief history of cacao farming, and told us how cacao had once been much larger in Costa Rica than it is now. But a fungus (I&#8217;m not sure which one it was) started spreading and largely wiped out the industry. (Depending on whom you ask, the fungus was either introduced accidentally, or the aforementioned ill-behaving fruit companies let it loose to lower the cost of cacao land so they could buy it for their own needs. Naturally, there is no proof either way.) The fungus still exists, and it&#8217;s a lot of work to keep it from healthy trees.<br />
Marcus has about 300 producing trees, and probably hundreds more &#8220;wild&#8221; trees that he doesn&#8217;t maintain. Not that you can readily tell which is which &#8212; unlike every farm I&#8217;ve been to, there were no markers, no clear delineation, and only a worn path through the grasses showed you where to go.<br />
The cacao pods are the size of a small football, and contain the cacao beans inside. The beans themselves are covered in a white fleshy covering that has a notably tangy citrus flavour (though you don&#8217;t actually bite into the bean at this point). The pods are harvested (we were there at roughly harvest time), and then allowed to ferment for a few days. The beans, separated from the pods, are then dried in the sun (whenever possible, given that it rains a lot on the coast), and eventually sent for roasting and processing.<br />
ChocoRart&#8217;s equipment seemed &#8230; well, not so much &#8220;quaint&#8221; as &#8220;antiquated&#8221;. But Marcus was adamant that nothing else was truly needed. The bulk of the work was tending the trees.<br />
We finally reached the roasting hut, where we saw the small fire with the small (but heavy) cast-iron wok where a previous batch of beans were already roasting away. The smell was &#8230; well, if you&#8217;ve ever had pure cacao, you might have an idea of what it might have smelled like. After roasting, the beans were shelled with a large rock, and with a fan, the nibs (the cracked pit of the bean) were separated from the shell. It&#8217;s the same process every large company uses, too.<br />
The nibs are then ground, which releases the oils, creating a thick brown paste of cacao. Mixed with a little water and a wee bit of spice, you get &#8212; duh &#8212; cacao. And it&#8217;s pretty darn tasty when it&#8217;s utterly fresh. (We all had small cups of it.) You loved it, Monkey. You just couldn&#8217;t stop licking your lips.<br />
Cane juice is then carmelised and reduced, and mixed together with the cacao paste (the bigger companies do this, too &#8212; it&#8217;s called &#8220;conching&#8221;). We were served this while still hot, with a spoon, and a slices of banana. It was gritty &#8212; not the smooth chocolate common after many hours of mixing &#8212; but absolutely fabulous. It might forever change the way I love my chocolate.<br />
We then had a chance to buy his products &#8212; short, round bars of flavoured &#8220;chocolate&#8221; that is hand-rolled. (We&#8217;ve already eaten all of it.) It wasn&#8217;t cheap, but it was utterly worth it. We had to be quick, though &#8212; you were hitting the ultimate chocolate high and were threatening to stair-dive down the very steep hill.<br />
And that was just our first day!<br />
You slept on the bed that night with Mommy, but fell off the side. Thanks to the mosquito netting, you didn&#8217;t &#8220;fall&#8221; so much as &#8220;slid&#8221;. You didn&#8217;t even wake up. I pulled you onto the mattress, got you sorted out, and then I slept on the bed with Mommy. (The last night there, you went right onto the mattress. We called it a &#8220;princess bed&#8221;.)<br />
Next day? Beach day. You weren&#8217;t particularly thrilled with it at first (Mommy and I weren&#8217;t thrilled that Cody and Ginger followed, and then wouldn&#8217;t leave us alone), but you quickly changed your tune. You would love the beach, and hate to leave it.<br />
The howler monkeys we&#8217;d kept hearing were in the trees above the pathway as we walked home, but weren&#8217;t in a howling mood at the time. You pointed and giggled happily, chanting &#8220;mono&#8221; and &#8220;monkey&#8221; (I think you&#8217;re finally understanding that the words mean the same thing). Thankfully, they&#8217;re not poo-flingers.<br />
Lunch at La Casa Del Pan again, but dinner at Azaria (one of the other places we&#8217;d looked at), which was also very good. You enjoyed running around quite a lot.<br />
Following breakfast on Friday morning, we moved up the road towards Puerto Viejo, and checked into Cariblue. A nice enough place, but I quickly remembered why I don&#8217;t like typical beach resorts &#8212; they all have the same campy look, over-priced food, and over-rated services. Bonus? You got to see &#8220;papa frogs&#8221; (what you call the green and black poison dart frog), Halloween crabs, and even a sloth!<br />
Well, that and a beach, too, of course.<br />
You had your own bed that night. A real bed.<br />
The next morning, we packed up to head home. But we didn&#8217;t go much further past Puerto Viejo, and turned southwest towards the town of Bribri, and the Bribri indigenous reserve. Mommy&#8217;s friend Rebecca lives there now, and we wanted to see where she lived, and the things she had been doing for the last few months.<br />
Once we passed through the town of Bribri, we turned onto a stone-laden road (it wasn&#8217;t even gravel) and drove for what seemed like a mistaken set of directions-length of time. After over 30 minutes, we arrived near the town of Suretka, and the house of Louisa and Solomon. There we found how their family, who live on the reserve, work to live off the land and hope that their efforts to drive tourism one day work in their favour.<br />
You played for a while with their children, Allison and David, and with their toys (you particularly liked David&#8217;s fire engine). We drank some limonade, and toured the buildings. Then Rebecca took us on a long drive down a road that ran through rivers before we got to BambÃº, and the BambÃº Indigenous Cultural Centre.<br />
The Cultural Centre is a place where visitors (usually university students) come to see what eco-tourism and indigenous tourism looks like. The Cultural Centre itself is set up like the traditional housing (even though almost everyone these days is in much more familiar walls-and-ceiling western-style buildings). Then Rebecca directed us back to Bribri where we dropped her off.<br />
The drive back home was actually easier than the drive out, though it took probably about as long. It was good to be home, to see Asia again (she ran from your squealing), and sleep in our own beds. If nothing else, a sign of a good vacation.<br />
Sadly, Monkey, my vacation is now over and I have to go back to work tomorrow. I hope that you have some memory of this trip that you can remember years from now. If not, though, we certainly have more than enough pictures of it all.<br />
The sun shone bright on our next morning</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Kiddo!  <br />
You probably won&#8217;t remember any of this when you finally get around to reading this, so I&#8217;m going to slide you a few details of the weekend.  <br />
1 May in many parts of the world is known as &#8220;May Day&#8221;, or &#8220;Labour Day&#8221;. Thanks to the Cold War, many people also think of 1 May as the day that Soviets drive tanks and nuclear missiles through Red Square. The Soviets kind of missed the point, there, as the goal of May Day was not to celebrate one&#8217;s military strength, but the power of your own proletariat &#8212; the workers themselves.  <br />
Here in Costa Rica, most people go to the beach.  <br />
<span id="more-1336"></span>Given how our Easter long weekend was totally thwarted by illness, we were quite anxious to actually leave Santa Ana for the first time since Valentine&#8217;s Day back in February (not counting our escape to Canada &#8212; that was already well-planned-for, and ultimately necessary due to visas). Mommy long ago made friends with another Avalon resident, Sandra, whose family owns a small B&amp;B in Guanacaste province.  <br />
Where exactly they had their B&amp;B was a topic for some debate for us (we only knew it was in Guanacaste, and that they were not far from a beach), but they claimed we were welcome to join them and experience a wonderful little weekend away from the Central Valley. That was pretty much what we needed, so the plans were put in place so we could head off bright and early Friday morning.  <br />
We left the condo at around 7:30, with the full intention of hitting the Denny&#8217;s near the airport for breakfast (not my first choice, but Mommy loves the place &#8212; you seem to dig the pancakes). We hit traffic within mere moments of getting on the highway. We drove on the shoulder for the last kilometre or so before the turnoff for breakfast. It wasn&#8217;t much better when we got back on, but thankfully let up just west of the airport (the highway narrows from three lanes to one lane, to two lanes, back to one lane (crossing a bridge) then back out to two again.  <br />
Highways in Costa Rica have &#8230; issues.  <br />
We hit pockets of traffic a few more times on our way west, just to the west of the road to Grecia, Naranjo, Palmares, San RamÃ³n, before running up and down the mountains to Esparza &#8212; following trucks means you go slowly. And then there&#8217;s one stoplight (literally) in Esparza that backed things up for a few kilometres. After that things got better, but still a little slow. Especially when you&#8217;ve got trucks (again) that don&#8217;t move along well, and some of the older cars and pickups have trouble getting over 40 km/h.  <br />
We stopped along the way, just before noon, at a restaurant called &#8220;The Green Turtle&#8221;. None of us were particularly hungry, but I was parched with thirst, and we could all use a bit of a break. The only thing we ate were frijoles molidas (black beans ground into a paste) with tortilla chips. You love the stuff. But you were more interested in playing on the slides they had there &#8212; playsets for the countless children who would likely arrive as the day went on.<br />
Finally passing through Liberia several hours later, we headed west towards the town of Guardia, where we&#8217;d turn south, and (hopefully) find our destination. Our instructions said &#8220;turn right at Guardia&#8221;. When I&#8217;d reviewed the instructions before I&#8217;d left the office on Thursday, they hadn&#8217;t made a lot of sense, especially when reviewed using the glory that is Google Earth.  <br />
The only right in Guardia would have turned us north, and we knew Sandra&#8217;s place to be near Playa del Coco. The next possible right seemed more &#8220;correct&#8221;, but when I looked at Google Earth, all I saw were farms. Now I know that Google Earth&#8217;s photos of Costa Rica are a few years old, so they aren&#8217;t that accurate. But even then, I could see fairly easily that there was something along a different road that showed what was likely the place we were going to be staying at for two nights.  <br />
(And yes, I&#8217;m intentionally being inaccurate about where we stayed. There&#8217;s a reason.)  <br />
Sure enough, when we turned right where the directions said to turn, all we found was farmland. (Burning farmland, actually. This seems to be the burning season when scrub is scorched in preparation for the rainy season.) After going much further down the road than we should have driven, we about-faced and headed back. Thankfully, Sandra also called and confirmed that we were on the wrong road.  <br />
Finally on the correct road, it was only a few minutes before we arrived at the B&amp;B. (And yes, it was exactly where I thought it would be. Your father has his moments of self-perceived genius. You&#8217;ll come to loathe it as much as Mommy.) And it was hot. Damn hot. The Central Valley has a wonderful climate &#8212; never too hot, never too cold. Guanacaste doesn&#8217;t have the benefit of the mountains to keep things regulated, and the lack of mountains means less rainfall. It&#8217;s been the warmest and driest summer in 50 years (&#8220;summer&#8221; here is when it&#8217;s not the rainy season), and it was plainly visible: dry creek beds, brown grass, wilted plants, and even the cattle looked parched.  <br />
Our first destination was the pool. All three of us were far too hot for reason, and Sandra&#8217;s boys easily encouraged a plunge. You drank a little too much pool water, though. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll cause any lasting damage.  <br />
One thing that does puzzle your mother and I, though &#8212; you always seem to get sick when we go out to the coast. I hope it isn&#8217;t an allergy to something. Perhaps only something as awful as a change in temperature?<br />
We headed into Playa del Coco to have dinner and do a little exploring. There was no mistaking the beach-town atmosphere, complete with open-air sports bars (including &#8220;tex-mex&#8221; food), souvenir and &#8220;artisan&#8221; stands, and more gringos than we&#8217;ve seen since we&#8217;d visited Canada. Playa del Coco is built-up, and away from the beach Mommy and I were reminded heavily of places we&#8217;d seen in Hawaii. The AutoMercado there carries things that we can&#8217;t even find in EscazÃƒ º.<br />
The beach itself is still a beach &#8212; it hasn&#8217;t been perverted into stands, stalls, and other commercial stuff. There seems to be a Costa Rican law that not only makes all beaches public (even when all the land surrounding them is private), but prevents their development &#8212; a beach is still a beach. And Playa del Coco is a nice beach, too. Not the nicest I&#8217;ve seen, but definitely in the upper third.  <br />
We ate dinner at a small restaurant at the beach&#8217;s edge, looking into the setting sun. It was a fantastic sunset, too &#8212; the best we&#8217;ve seen since arriving here last June (a very sad reality, given how many good sunset we had hoped to have seen by now). Sadly, dinner was a bit of a wash &#8212; you didn&#8217;t feel like eating (at all), screaming and whining through most of it. Sorry to be so blunt, but it was definitely unlike you &#8212; you&#8217;ve never turned down spaghetti before.<br />
That was followed by perhaps one of the worst evenings I can recall as a father. I don&#8217;t know what was wrong, kiddo, I can only presume you were so tired that you couldn&#8217;t get comfortable. But you whimpered and cried for what seemed like hours. Mommy tried very hard to get you to lie still and rest, but in the end she had to hold you for about a half hour before you would go to sleep. None of us rested well that night.  <br />
Playa Hermosa lies just to the north of Playa del Coco, so we headed up the extra two kilometres for a different beach. (Incidentally, we found most of the distance markers highly suspect &#8212; Mommy suspects the distances are &#8220;as the crow flies&#8221;, since there&#8217;s no way to drive in the short distances the signs suggest.) Despite the proximity to Coco, Hermosa is a very different place, being almost entirely a haven for condos and hotels. There are almost no stores, and there seem to be more residents or time-share owners than there are actual tourists.  <br />
Playa Hermosa itself is much nicer than Playa del Coco &#8212; the sand is softer, the water clearer, and there&#8217;s more shade, too. We got there at a perfect time to park near the entrance to the beach (little more than the end of a road) and claim a prime spot on the beach, still in the shade of a large tree.  <br />
That was about as good as it got, sadly. Maybe it was the lack of sleep, kiddo, but you absolutely would have nothing to do with that beach. I&#8217;ve never seen you object so vehemently about something. You hated walking on the sand (whether or not you wore shoes), and the thought of going into the water created sounds out of you that would have curdled the blood of the most fearless soldiers. You and Mommy spent almost all of your time on the beach mats, while I swam alone. It wasn&#8217;t the same without you.<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t sleep back at the B&amp;B, either. But a dip in the pool seemed to make everyone feel a better.   Enough that the three of us scooted back into Playa del Coco for pizza (that happens to be one of your favourite words right now) at La Dolce Vita, just north of the town&#8217;s beach centre. You had an entire slice to yourself, which you ate quite happily.  <br />
We stopped for gelato on the way back. You had a mango ice, which you ate eagerly. You didn&#8217;t even shiver or make faces, which you usually do when eating cold things. I swear you would have tried to lick the inside of the cup if anyone had shown you that it was possible.  <br />
You fell asleep in the car on the way back to the B&amp;B, and despite not liking being carried from the car to your playpen, you went back to sleep about 20 minutes later for about two hours, which I think you needed. Mommy and I sat outside reading &#8212; she was reading Dog the Bounty Hunter&#8217;s autobiography while I read up on climate change and Egyptian history in National Geographic. (I&#8217;m sure you know by now that your father is a geek.)  <br />
We tried to see the sunset that night at Playa Ocotel, a few kilometres to the south of Coco, but the clouds obscured virtually everything. There was a hint of light, but that was about it. We trucked off back to Hermosa for dinner at Ginger&#8217;s, which was a recommendation from Sandra. You ate a lot of the Sopa Azteca (&#8220;Mexican soup&#8221;), revelling in the tortilla chips and sour cream. You ate a lot that night, which made both Mommy and I very happy.<br />
We all sleep much better that night.  <br />
Breakfast was at the Hilton Garden Inn, across from the Liberia airport. Mommy wanted something &#8220;typical&#8221; rather than &#8220;tipico&#8221;. Although I&#8217;m sure she thinks that I disapproved of going there, I actually quite liked it. Everyone there seemed to love our adorable little girl who was smiling, babbling, and (mostly) behaving like an angel (the fork banging notwithstanding).  <br />
Our trip home was considerably easier and faster than our trip out, and you slept about half of it (so I understand if you don&#8217;t remember a thing about the drive &#8212; there&#8217;s lots of time for us to bore you to tears with long drives). We didn&#8217;t eat until we got back to Santa Ana, at the Soda Tapia. You had chicken fingers again, along with some french fried potatoes (which Mommy and I ate many of, as well).  <br />
And last night, you had your first ever experience with Indian food, which we got from Tandoori Palace, a little restaurance in Lindora, owned by a guy who had lived in Calgary for a few years. Arguably far better than I would have expected for Costa Rica, this Indian actually ranks way up in my books for quality and taste. You ate a lot of the rice and samosa, though Mommy and I weren&#8217;t up to serving you the butter chiken or the dahl &#8212; we were certain you&#8217;d find the spice a bit painful.  <br />
It was a long weekend, but in a good way. We all got a bit of a break, and I got to spend a lot more time with you than I usually get in a given week. We will have to try to have more of these weekends!<br />
And yes, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/sets/72157617668228296/">we have pictures of you there</a> as proof.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I&#8217;ve been in Costa for nearly two straight months now &#8212; this is the longest continuous time I&#8217;ve ever spent outside of Canada &#8212; and I think it&#8217;s high time to answer the two most often-asked questions that I get: What do I like about Costa Rica, and what do I hate?<br />
I&#8217;ll answer the latter in <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/09/17-things-i-hate-about-costa-rica/">a separate post</a>, but like all reviews, there&#8217;s reason to start with the positive stuff. Of course, these are not in any order whatsoever &#8212; they&#8217;re just as they come to mind.</p>
<h3><span id="more-1103"></span>The Food</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to go to any country and not enjoy eating differently than you do where you came from. Much of the food here is Spanish-influenced (kind of obvious), but draws heavily on Peruvian, Mexican, American (you wouldn&#8217;t believe the number of KFC outlets here), Italian, and then a hodge-podge of other cuisines. There&#8217;s a lot more seafood, especially when you&#8217;re on the coasts, and healthy portions of chicken and beef. And fresh fruit.<br />
It&#8217;s not spicy, but there is a fair bit of fat as a result of oils, which is sometimes a bit hard to get by. But it&#8217;s fairly easy to avoid the deep-fried stuff.</p>
<h3>Fresh Fruit</h3>
<p>The biggest problem in Calgary when it comes to fruit is getting it fresh. And I mean <em>fresh</em>, as in the originating farm is less than 100 kms away. And here, it&#8217;s probably less than 10 kms. I&#8217;ve never had pineapple this fresh, papaya that is outstanding, and absolutely wonderful strawberries. And unlike back in Canada, there is no &#8220;season&#8221; &#8212; you get this fruit year-round.</p>
<h3>The Beer&#8230;</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no Big Rock, no Sleemans, and certainly no Guinness. But in this heat, lighter beers are much more appreciated, anyway. Especially when they&#8217;re cheap. Your average bottle of Imperial (the most popular beer in Costa Rica) is 4.8% alcohol (by volume) and costs less than a dollar at the store. How can you go wrong with that?!</p>
<h3>&#8230; And Getting It Anywhere</h3>
<p>And wine, and liquor. No stupid rules like back in Canada &#8212; the grocery stores sell beer right next to the legs of lamb. Like it should be. The only place in Canada you can do that is in Quebec, which is a real shame as the heavy restructions on alcohol are likely part of the reason why people drink &#8212; it&#8217;s a taboo, rather than a normal part of life.<br />
The only place you can&#8217;t get any alcohol is at the football games. It&#8217;s an absolute no-no, and searches for booze are pretty strict on entrance. But then, we North Americans aren&#8217;t used to seeing riot police in regular attendance, either.</p>
<h3>Year-Round Green</h3>
<p>A note on the weather: to a Canuck, the seasons don&#8217;t change much in Costa Rica. It goes from warm and dry to warm and wet. (Or hot and wet to hot and dry, or just plain hot and wet, depending on where you are in the country.) People here start to haul out jackets when the sun goes down, but I wear shorts as much as I can (only the air conditioning at the office makes me think otherwise) and I almost always wear sandals.<br />
The heat, combined with the plentiful rain, means the leaves never fall from the trees, so the trees stay green year-round. (There is one tree I&#8217;ve seen that is losing its leaves, but there seem to be new green ones sprouting already.)</p>
<h3>Costa Rican Coffee</h3>
<p>Okay, I don&#8217;t drink coffee &#8212; yet (I&#8217;m determined to try, soon), but all I have to do is smell it to know the coffee here is outstanding. But this is also a coffee-growing country, so you have to expect it. All I do know is that Alex, Mark, and Jason have all raved about the coffee.<br />
And yes, when I do get around to having my first cup of joe, I&#8217;ll be documenting it. You folks don&#8217;t wanna miss that&#8230;</p>
<h3>The Beaches and the Ocean</h3>
<p>We are about 90-100 kms from a the beach. Not just any beach &#8212; a <em>good </em>beach. Given, that 100 kms takes about 2.5 hours to drive, thanks to the rather poor road situation here (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/09/17-things-i-hate-about-costa-rica/">the  Hate list</a> for more info). The ocean is also warm, like a nice warm bath. Not like the oceans on either side of Canada, which will deliver a pretty decent chill up your spine, no matter what time of year it is.</p>
<h3>Rainforests</h3>
<p>There is nothing like walking under the thick canopies, listening to countless birds, monkeys, insects, and who-knows-what-else while rain trickles down from above. That is, if you can get past the creepy-crawly things that live there. Not everyone can hack the spiders, snakes, huge beetles, millipedes, and mosquitoes. Personally, I love it. The closest I&#8217;ve come are the coastal forests in British Columbia. But these are, well, foreign to me, and offer such a different experience.</p>
<h3>The Birds</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m used to magpies (which I hate), robins, sparrows, crows, hawks, and if I&#8217;m really lucky, we might get some finches. All fairly typical of western Canada.<br />
Down here? Buzzards, toucans, birds of nearly every colour, and songs that we&#8217;ve never heard and that seem to change nearly every day. This is something I never tire of.</p>
<h3>Crickets</h3>
<p>I grew up with crickets chirping out my window at night. Alberta is devoid of crickets. Or at least where I am, there aren&#8217;t any to be heard. Once again, when the screen door is open (which is most nights), I can hear not only the chirping, but also the croaking of frogs out in the lago.</p>
<h3>Monkeys!!!</h3>
<p>I love monkeys. (Yeah, probably because I&#8217;m related to them. I&#8217;ve heard the joke. Next&#8230;) It is very easy to find wild monkeys in Costa Rica. Howlers are easy to hear at a distance, and if you&#8217;re lucky <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2774164871/">you&#8217;ll be chased by capuchins looking for a banana</a>.</p>
<h3>Relaxed Environment</h3>
<p>No-one really rushes here. The insane drive that most North Americans are attuned to doesn&#8217;t exist down here. There is no urgency (which is also not a good thing), no heavy pressure, and a much more laid-back attitude. While you might hate it at first, you slowly get sucked into it. It&#8217;s actually nice, once you get used to it.</p>
<h3>Storms</h3>
<p>It rains here nearly every day (we&#8217;re in the rainy season at the moment), sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for hours. But at least once a week, we get a good thunderstorm. A rip-snorting one that rattles windows and knocks out power. I grew up to those kinds of storms, too, and Calgary just doesn&#8217;t get good thunderstorms.</p>
<h3>Extreme Friendliness</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find someone who&#8217;s a real jerk. (And you know it when you do!) Most people here smile on mere gaze, and if you&#8217;re carrying a cute baby (like we regularly do), you&#8217;ll have people walk right up to you and chat you right up as if you&#8217;re a local. They&#8217;ll even ask to pick your child up and show it off to whomever&#8217;s around. It&#8217;s a little odd, but it&#8217;s still a wonderful thing.</p>
<h3>Things You Won&#8217;t See On The Hate List</h3>
<p>These are things I don&#8217;t hate, but perhaps not necessarily love. Still, they&#8217;re worth calling out because &#8212; believe it or not &#8212; I&#8217;ve been asked about all of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rain. Believe it or not, I actually don&#8217;t mind it here. It&#8217;s not cold, and even in the heaviest part of the year (which we&#8217;re in), it&#8217;s not really terrible as one might think.</li>
<li>Heat. I don&#8217;t dig heat, I admit that. But I&#8217;m acclimatising. I don&#8217;t sweat (as much) and I don&#8217;t complain about the heat (as much).</li>
<li>Lack of skilled help. This should drive me crazy, given that I need to find skilled help, but in the end I&#8217;m actually looking forward to the training aspect</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother&#8217;s Day in Costa Rica doth not come in May, like we&#8217;re used to in North America. Here, it&#8217;s 15 August. This is the day (so I&#8217;ve read) that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02006b.htm">Virgin Mary ascended to Heaven</a>, and given that this is a very Roman Catholic-centric society, Christian Holy Days are holidays. That means <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADa_de_la_madre">El DÃ­ ­a de la Madre</a> takes on extra importance here. Down here, it really is a religion.<br />
Which is good for me, believe it or not. You see, back in May, I royally screwed up and really blew Alex&#8217;s first Mother&#8217;s Day by doing &#8230; well, nothing. At least nothing of note. Not exactly a wise thing to do on a mother&#8217;s first Mother&#8217;s Day. I had some serious <span style="text-decoration: line-through">sucking</span> making up to do.<br />
<span id="more-1035"></span>My plan? Another surprise weekend. And given that it was a long weekend, it was a good chance to go a bit further than before and see something new and interesting. So I started hunting around for interesting places to go. Originally, it was to head out to Arenal &#8212; a place we&#8217;ve both been to and like. But I couldn&#8217;t get a good room.<br />
I stumbled across a beach resort called <a href="http://www.ylangylangresort.com/">Ylang Ylang</a>. Not the nicest website, sadly. (I should offer them services in return for a week&#8217;s stay or something. To take pictures for the website, of course.) But they had two major offerings listed on their website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candlelit dinners</li>
<li>Hammocks &#8220;everywhere&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>The tricky part is getting there. Ylang Ylang is in <a href="http://www.nicoyapeninsula.com/montezuma/">Montezuma</a>, a small remote former fishing village on the Nicoya Peninsula. There are two &#8220;overland&#8221; routes: One that takes you to Puntarenas where you board a ferry to Paquera, and one in a loop over the north end of the Gulf of Nicoya (which is about 5-6 hours longer).<br />
This was the first real test of the Suzuki for distance. By 9:00am, we were packed and hitting the road for Montezuma. Well, almost. We had to stop at MÃ¡s Por Menos for some supplies. While Alex shopped, I had to make a quick return trip home to get the forgotten stroller, which is when I found out that my keycard no longer worked, necessitating a long conversation with the security guard in broken Spanish.<br />
But I digress.<br />
My biggest worry for the trip out was running into another <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/08/u-turns-are-illegal-in-costa-rica/">jerk cop who wanted to give me a hard time</a> for not having any metal license plates on my car. At the moment, I have the official permit that says I can drive my car, but no plates. This is &#8220;normal&#8221; in Costa Rica and you see a couple cars a day like this. The joys of backlogs of paperwork. Still, after my last run-in, I didn&#8217;t want to go through the trouble with a disgruntled infant.<br />
The trip to <a href="http://www.puntarenas.com/puntarenas/">Puntarenas</a> is barely 80 kilometres. But it takes about two hours to drive, thanks largely to the Costa Rican highway system, which is just shy of pathetic. Unlike the countries to the north and south of Costa Rica, the highways here are in perpetually poor state and simply not well-designed. They snake all over the mountains rather than cutting through them (or under them) to alleviate the dangerous hairpin turns and really dangerous nighttime traversals.<br />
On a map, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.980009,-84.823637&amp;spn=0.04421,0.06712&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">Puntarenas doesn&#8217;t really look that long of a spit of land into the Gulf</a>, but it still took over 20 minutes of driving to finally get to the end, where we found the line for the Paquera ferry. Being a long weekend, it was a long line. We climbed out and were heading up the line to buy a ticket when a very sweaty young man by the name of Marcos (who spoke surprisingly good English) told us to stay with the car.<br />
This is how we found out how the process works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you arrive for the ferry, you wait for a ferry employee to come to your car and give you a vehicle classification ticket. Our car, for example, was &#8220;Vehiculo Liviando&#8221;, basically a sedan.</li>
<li>You take said ticket to the ferry ticket wicket, where you purchase your boarding. You buy for the car as well as its occupants &#8212; two adults, in this case (kid ride for free!)</li>
<li>You return to your car and drive onto the ferry</li>
</ul>
<p>Marcos was a particularly nice guy. The two of us chatted on the way up the line to the ticket booth, at which point he told me to move the car to a small parking area (it was a rocky dirt lot) and told me to wait for him there. Because he &#8220;liked [our] baby&#8221;, he was going to let us cut into the line to make sure we got on the ferry.<br />
When people say that Ticos are nice, they&#8217;re not kidding. They are nice. Far too nice. They make Canadians look like assholes, they&#8217;re so nice.<br />
The ferry itself looked little more than one of those smaller ferries they use in BC for the short island hops with low traffic: a car deck, with a smaller deck above it for walk-on pedestrians. The ship was deceptively small, and had a &#8220;hidden&#8221; lower deck that cars drove into (through hatches on the main deck). This is where we parked. It&#8217;s dark, dank, stiflingly hot (which isn&#8217;t much of a stretch &#8212; all of Puntarenas is stiflingly hot compared to Santa Ana), and once all the cars are in, cramped. The upper deck is air-conditioned, but you could barely tell.<br />

The trip over is about an hour and a quarter. Then it&#8217;s back in your car, and away you go &#8230; to try not get lost. (Remember, Alex didn&#8217;t know where we were going, so I was going off a half-memorised map and some road signs.) And off we went.<br />
The distance from Paquera to Montezuma is about 30-40 kms. Which takes an hour to drive. Like the rest of Costa Rica, the roads are windy, so you can&#8217;t drive quickly. The last 7 kilometres from Cobano to Montezuma are some of the worst roads I&#8217;ve seen outside of Mongolia. The last 500 metres are down a 18% grade unpaved rocky hill with a near-hairpin turn at the bottom.<br />
Fun. Reason #158 we bought a 4&#215;4.<br />
You are rewarded, however. Although Montezuma has probably more hotels than homes, it&#8217;s so quaint that you don&#8217;t even really see the hotels. There are no chains to be seen in Montezuma &#8212; and it&#8217;ll likely be a long, cold day in Hell before that happens.<br />
There are basically three main roads in Montezuma &#8212; the &#8220;highway&#8221; that runs all the way down the coast, one road that runs perpendicularly towards to the only other road in Montezuma, running parallel to the highway for a little over two blocks, connecting the two main parts of Playa Montezuma. The tallest building doesn&#8217;t even come to the height of the trees, and the newest-looking thing is a Coca-Cola sign hanging over one of the stores.<br />

In other words, a little slice of quaint paradise.<br />
We pulled into <a href="http://www.elbanano.com/elsanobanano.html">El Sano Banano</a>, an odd-named hotel that is the parent owner of Ylang Ylang (the latter being decidedly more upscale, although still insanely less expensive than a comparable place in North America). I ran in to &#8220;check-in&#8221; (you do Ylang Ylang check-in at El Sano Banano), then drove around the back to get to the parking lot. You can&#8217;t drive to Ylang Ylang &#8212; there&#8217;s a shuttle for you. The parking lot has a 24-hour guard.<br />
The shuttle arrived about 30 minutes later. A Land Rover Defender. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Boy, isn&#8217;t that pretentious?&#8221; It&#8217;s not (just) about being pretentious &#8212; it&#8217;s about being functional and appropriate. The drive from El Sano Banano is not far &#8212; only a 10-minute walk, really &#8212; but it&#8217;s over a beach with rocky outcroppings, and carrying bags that far ain&#8217;t easy. An ordinary car wouldn&#8217;t make it, let alone something like a golf cart.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774031253(small)[/flickr]<br />
We soon found something interesting about Ylang Ylang &#8212; unlike virtually every other place that we&#8217;ve been to in Costa Rica so far, almost every single person at Ylang Ylang speaks very good English. And are extremely friendly (moreso than regular Ticos). Our driver (I&#8217;m going to call him &#8220;Carlos&#8221; because I honestly forget his name) constantly tried to make Mi Pequeña Niña giggle (which isn&#8217;t that hard, and is very rewarding &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing like baby laughter).<br />
We arrived with a pair of women who were also from Santa Ana &#8212; teachers from NYU at a satellite school. I think Jason, Mark, and I met their students <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/06/second-weekend-in-costa-rica/">a few weeks ago in Bar Amigo</a> when we were out scouting Santa Ana. They were staying in the room right next to us.<br />
The room, incidentally, was down a 250-metre tiled path through the beach-front forest to a 3-storey, 6-room (the upper rooms are two-storey lofts) building. Ylang Ylang doesn&#8217;t have a lot of available rooms &#8212; maybe 15 in total. You couldn&#8217;t have more than 45 people there at any time, even with triple occupancy in the larger rooms. It&#8217;s a big space, and you don&#8217;t feel even remotely cramped.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774106193(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774954666(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774122541(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
The room had two double beds with mosquito nets above them. It&#8217;s the rainy season right now, which seems to mean that you aren&#8217;t likely see mosquitoes much, actually. And although <a href="http://www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk/destinations/malariamaps/costarica.htm">Costa Rica is in the &#8220;malaria zone&#8221;</a>, Ingrid (one of my co-workers) has lived here most of her life, been all over the country, been bitten by countless mosquitos, and doesn&#8217;t know a person who&#8217;s had malaria.<br />
(That&#8217;s not in any way a defence, more a statement of fact and a lessening of my mother&#8217;s blood pressure that we might be getting a nasty disease here.)<br />
No air conditioning. That part wasn&#8217;t so good. Ylang Ylang is more environmentally-conscious than most places I&#8217;ve been to, and I guess A/C isn&#8217;t one of their preferred items. There were two ceiling fans at least. No glass on the windows (and no screens beyond the shutters) meant a constant fresh-air supply, and some airflow through the room. Also, a very clear (and sometimes loud) serenade of the surf on the adjacent beach.<br />
We ate dinner early the first night &#8212; we had to get food into our child before she had a total meltdown. She ate most of a plate of spaghetti (cutting noodles for children is not easy). I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember what Alex ate. As for me, I had probably the best blackened tuna I have ever eaten in my life. I&#8217;ve had many &#8220;blackened&#8221; meals in my day ever since <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/1996/04/road-trip-southwest-new-orleans/">first sampling one in New Orleans</a>. But never one that good. I&#8217;m sorry, Nawlins, but this chef actually out-did you. I&#8217;m still in awe days later.<br />
Sleep was rough the first night. Too hot (we were getting adjusted to the temperatures on the coast) and the surf was a bit too loud for my liking. Fortunately, the kid slept well. At least until 5:15. That&#8217;s when we had our wake-up call.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774153357(small)[/flickr]<br />
A howler monkey.<br />
Fortunately, I knew what a howler monkey sounded like &#8212; our first trip to Costa Rica back in 2005 featured a little hike around the back of Arenal Volcano, and a howler monkey serenade. Loud buggers. Especially at 5:15, less than 20 metres from your glass-less window. Everyone was up for the day at that point. Going back to sleep simply wasn&#8217;t an option.<br />
Because breakfast wasn&#8217;t served until 7:00 (and we were there pretty much on the dot), there was a signficant amount of distraction needed so Mi Pequeña Niña didn&#8217;t meltdown from lack of food. Fortunately, a beach makes for a great distraction.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774099171(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774097061(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774964112(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774962698(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774971738(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774972240(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
We wandered into Montezuma after the morning nap to get a better look. I wasn&#8217;t really surprised when we realised that we had already seen the entire village when we&#8217;d arrived the day before. Montezuma is small, quaint, and at the time not heavily populated. A lot of English is spoken there, though &#8212; it must attract a lot of North Americans. (I was told later it&#8217;s known by the locals as &#8220;Montefuma&#8221; for all the marijuana smoke &#8212; something that must come out in the high season. High season. Get it? HAH! I kill me&#8230;)<br />
We wandered into a couple of stores, MPN was fawned over by a number of people (it happens a lot) before we went to a small place called Organics for lunch. Think of a nice bistro-style open-air restaurant run by vegans. That&#8217;s pretty much what this place was. Good food, though. Probably the best nachos I&#8217;ve ever had (not cornmeal chips &#8212; something else entirely different), and an amazingly flavourful black bean dip. I tried to feed an avocado sandwich to the Wee One, getting almost as much avocado on me as in her.<br />
By the time we headed back to Ylang Ylang, the tide had come all the way in and pushing the stroller was almost impossible (the hard-packed sand is only available at lower tides). I ended up dragging it most of the way back. I was dripping sweat. It was so hot that an afternoon nap wasn&#8217;t an option &#8212; the blood-curdling screaming was enough of a sign of that.<br />
Hence, a dip in the pool. Although the ocean there is fantastic (the temperature of a nice, warm bath), the surf made going in not an option with MPN. The pool more than sufficed, and three of us swam for close to 45 minutes. The coolness also restored our core body temperatures, allowing the afternoon nap to actually take place.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774116929(small)[/flickr]<br />
Alex rocked in the many hammocks, read one of the Babysitter&#8217;s Club books (she loved &#8217;em as a youth, and loves them still for the quick readability), while I traipsed around in the ocean. On one of my trips back to make sure MPN was still asleep (about two hours all told), a troop of white-faced capuchins were running across the reception building, crossing over to trees and carrying on only as monkeys can.<br />
Fortunately, no poo-throwing.<br />
Curious little buggers, they came right down close to the pool area to see if there was food or anything shiny (they&#8217;re great thieves). One of them came quite close down a palm leaf and gave Alex and I a bit of a scare. You&#8217;re never really sure if one of these things might jump on you, and capuchins aren&#8217;t exactly the cleanest of animals to have jump on you.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774859976(small)[/flickr]<br />
It wouldn&#8217;t be our only run-in with capuchins that day. When the Wee One finally woke, I took her out to the restaurant area to have a snack while Alex got a good back massage (to make up for the el crapo one she got at Punta Leona a couple of weeks ago). One of the capuchins noticed that I was carrying a banana as I walked down the path, babe in arms. It came right down on a branch mere feet away. I shooed it and made a break for the restaurant, just in case it got grabby.<br />
Well, be darned if it didn&#8217;t race back up that tree to see where I was going, then run from tree-top to tree-top following us, across the restaurant&#8217;s roof and climbed down one of the supports to wait for us. Darn sneaking things. Cute, yes, but a little needy. I shooed it away again.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774164871(small)[/flickr]<br />
The restaurant staff, of course, saw all this and laughed. The capuchins play here a lot, and people encourage it, so things are a little less-natural than perhaps they should be. Monkeys ain&#8217;t stupid, though &#8212; people are. One of the restaurant staff even demonstrated the capuchins&#8217; desire for bananas for us (there was also another family with young kids from LA), by taking an older banana (quite brown) and coaxing one such monkey from a nearby palm tree.<br />
It almost came out for the entire banana, but the kids shrieked and scared the monkey. Broken in half and given in two portions tossed out on the grass, the monkey was a little more brave.<br />
[flickr]photo:2775144806(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774282729(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Dinner was again fantastic. While Mi Pequeña Niña downed most of a very tasty quesadilla, I went through a wonderful Thai-style teriyaki tuna. (I&#8217;m struggling to remember what Alex had. I think my food thoroughly distracts me. I know she had chicken, but I&#8217;m darned to remember what exactly.)<br />
Just as we put the Wee One to sleep, it started to rain. Little did we know, but a storm was rolling in across the country. It rained all night. Heavily. No night photography for me in Montezuma &#8212; I&#8217;ll just have to go back! The rain pounded through all the trees, even drowning out the nearby surf.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774874214(small)[/flickr]<br />
The storm was pretty big, and the next morning the damage was clear &#8212; about 1/5th of the sand on the beach had been washed out. (Carlos would later explain that this is normal, and happens in September and October every year.)<br />
[flickr]photo:2774935368(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774092431(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
At 9:00, the Defender took us back to El Sano Banano, where we loaded up the Suzuki for the ride home. Alex stopped in the store to pick up some supplies (baby food, &#8220;just in case&#8221;), and some postcards. A couple last pictures, and we headed back up the even-more-treacherous hill. Thankfully, we have a 4&#215;4 &#8212; going up in anything else wouldn&#8217;t be so easy, I think. The road back was quite muddy.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774520851(small)[/flickr]<br />
Having no idea what time the ferry actually left from Paquera, there was the possibility of us missing it. As cars started to whip past us quite quickly, I began to think that maybe they were racing for the ferry, too. But driving quickly in what was turning into another torrential downpour didn&#8217;t strike me as a good idea &#8212; straight roads here are a rarity.<br />
We got to the ferry line after loading had started. Alex stayed with the car while I raced off to get a ticket. The line was vastly unorganised and excruciatingly slow, and I had some lady behind me who constantly kept bumping into me &#8212; a pickpocket&#8217;s technique &#8212; though nothing was lifted (I keep my rear pockets devoid of anything). I managed to get the tickets to Alex just as she arrived at the front of the line to drive on. I slapped the tickets into the ticket-collector&#8217;s hands, but instead of getting back in the car, he directed me to walk on &#8212; the long way. I had to run to catch up with Alex on the main deck.<br />
It rained part of the trip back. But Puntarenas was sunny and warm. Originally thinking we might stop there for lunch, we opted to hit the road and find something along the way. At Esparza, I pulled off at a roadside diner-like establishment that seemed to be a major stopping point for buses. We both opted for a casado con pollo (a typical Tico dish with rice, beans, shredded cabbage or lettuce, and chicken), feeding some of it to Mi Pequeña Niña.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it was all the buses that were stopping, or if it was Esparza, or my own imagination, but I began to get a little nervous about our car. People were getting too close to it. One jerk even cuddled up to it, looking like he might try to rip off the antenna.<br />
There&#8217;s a problem in Costa Rica, mostly with rental vehicles. People puncture holes in the tires, then follow you until you pull over because of the flat. They offer to help you, and steal all your luggage. I don&#8217;t know how common this is, but most of the travel books and rental agencies warn you about it. (Avis&#8217;s insurance won&#8217;t cover the tires, no matter how much you get.) We ended up racing through the end of our meal to get back to our new car before something bad happened.<br />
Turned out it was just that the guy was a jerk.<br />
Not long after we left Esparza, the rain hit again. It was raining pretty much everywhere on Sunday, and heavily. Even for the rainy season, it was a lot. All the way over the mountains, it poured. Even creeks were racing with all the water. A tractor-trailer with a short container load even flipped on one of the many hairpin curves. A sure sign that the driving should be done with due care.<br />
We stopped only once on our way back, when Alex spotted wooden toys for sale at the side of the road. I&#8217;d spotted little trucks, but she&#8217;d seen the rocking horses. After a short double-back, we picked one of them up. It&#8217;s Mi Pequeña Niña&#8217;s first birthday on Friday, and we wanted to get her something nice. I think it was a great idea.<br />
Once we got past Grecia, the trip was pretty easily. I&#8217;ve done that part of the Panamerican so much that I almost have it memorised. We stopped at the Auto Mercado for groceries (running into Jason and Jen, and raving about Ylang Ylang to them) before heading home. I&#8217;ve lost faith in Auto Mercado, as their produce is beyond sketchy (a bunch of bad bananas and a bad mango all in one shot?). MÃ¡s Por Menos seems to be better, and Fresh Market is usually the best (and most expensive).<br />
Home in the rain, and it rained all night. The Lago even flooded yesterday at the complex, and they were fixing the overflow drain this morning.<br />
The next adventure? Don&#8217;t know yet. Maybe a return to Arenal, maybe a flight out to Tortuguero (the drive is not easy or short), maybe just little trips around the area. We&#8217;ll see.<br />
But stay tuned&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s funny the number of people who now ask me if they can come with us to Costa Rica. They congratulate me and make it sound like it&#8217;s going to be fun, sand, and cervesa all the time.<br />
News flash, folks &#8212; we ain&#8217;t working on a beach. We&#8217;re not even close. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=costa+rica&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.981235,-84.144888&amp;spn=0.005706,0.008905&amp;t=h&amp;z=17">This is where our office is/will be.</a> Note the extreme lack of nearby sand and water.<br />
It&#8217;s the Metro Free Trade Zone Business Park, a mere 5 minutes from the airport. The nearest (decent) beach is 5 hours away over very bad roads (and drivers that would scare the pants of 99% of North American drivers). Yes, we&#8217;re closer than Calgary.<br />
But not <em>that </em>close.</p>
