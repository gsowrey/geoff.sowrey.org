										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sit here at my kitchen table, rubbing the weariness from my eyes. Not the things you&#8217;d normally hear from me, mind you &#8212; I haven&#8217;t been working too hard as of late (as you know, my big project is done). No, this is from something much better &#8212; spending time with my family, and notably you, Monkey.<br />
The last four days have been a lot of fun. Maybe even too much fun. Both of us are pretty pooped. You went to bed and for the first time in a long while, there wasn&#8217;t hours of chatter from your room. I think you pretty much passed out. I won&#8217;t be too far behind you, I think, but I do wish to describe the fun that we&#8217;ve shared.<br />
&#8216;Cuz, frankly, I&#8217;m not sure how the heck I survived it all&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-2688"></span>First off was Canada Day. This year, Mommy and I decided to try a visit at Heritage Park. If you got there early enough, you got a free pancake breakfast. It seemed like a fun thing to do. And it probably would have been more fun if it had been a few degrees warmer &#8212; it was rather chilly for the first day of July.<br />
Still, you had a lot of fun. Once we&#8217;d gobbled down the pancakes, we went and got ride tickets. You swung on a vintage ship-styled swing, rode the big steam train around the park, went on the paddlewheeler out in Glenmore Reservoir (although you barely stopped moving the entire time, necessitating me following you around the entire time), and went on the merry-go-round (you demanded to ride the white horse).<br />
You ate a pretzel, and drank some frozen lemonade with me. We saw the farm animals (you mooed at the cows, and nearly had your bright red Crocs eaten by a misguided horse). Then we went through Gasoline Alley. By this point, you were tired and got fairly cranky, so we all opted to go home.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762441701(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762451847(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762453683(square)[/flickr]<br />
Mommy wanted to go visit with Grandpa for a week, and had to take Choo Choo with her. (Choo Choo&#8217;s still nursing, so she goes wherever Mommy goes.) But &#8230; well, Monkey, all me to be rather honest for a moment &#8212; travelling with you lately requires a lot of high-test drugs to keep people calm. Either you or us, it doesn&#8217;t matter. But Mommy travelling with you and Choo Choo wasn&#8217;t even discussed as an option, and Mommy really wanted to go without all of us in tow. (You&#8217;ll understand this years from now, when you have a near-3 year old.)<br />
Of course, what all that means is, it was just you and me, kid. And we got off to it before Mommy and Choo Choo&#8217;s plane had taken off.<br />
Our first stop was the Galaxie Diner on 11th St., not far from Grandma&#8217;s house. There we enjoyed a filling breakfast, because we had a long day of chasing trains ahead of you. I hadn&#8217;t chased a train since before you were born, and I was itching to go out and take pictures. I figured you might like to see a big train in motion, and when my friend Graham told me CP 2816 was going out to Banff on 2 July, I couldn&#8217;t resist.<br />
After breakfast, we went home just long enough to get a few things together (like my camera), and then we went searching for our first place to wait. I originally thought of a place known as Keith, which is roughly where Stoney Trail crosses the Bow River. But as we came down Sarcee Trail towards the highway, I spied an even better location: where the train tracks cross 32nd Ave NW. It would give me an easy access for photography, a decent backdrop, and not far from the highway to get back out again.<br />
We ended up having to wait longer than I would have liked. One thing you&#8217;ll learn, kiddo, is that when you chase trains, you have to be patient and wait. A lot. Even though Graham was sending me text messages on the train&#8217;s status, it didn&#8217;t come quickly. We saw a freight train have to wait for CP 2816, too. But eventually, we got the note that she was heading west. Before long, we could hear its whistle echo through the valley. It came towards us, barrelling along as fast as it could, belching out black smoke.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762469809(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4763109230(square)[/flickr]<br />
For a moment, I saw myself in you. When I was your age (maybe a little older), your granddad (my daddy) used to take my family (Nana, Auntie Cathy, and me) to the train tracks near our house, to watch another steam locomotive &#8212; CN 6060 &#8212; come racing by, huge clouds of black smoke filling up the sky. It used to scare the hell out of me. Of course, I look back at that now and I feel really glad that I did see that &#8212; it&#8217;s a fond memory. I hope maybe one day, it is for you, too.<br />
We hit the road and headed out to a place out towards the mountains called Ozada. You were asleep before we were outside city limits, and slept all the way there. Ozada is on the Stoney Indian reserve, and is one of Canadian Pacific&#8217;s old stations for servicing steam locomotives. (The concrete pylons for the coaling and water towers are still visible.) Today, it&#8217;s little more than a siding in the middle of nowhere, just off the highway. And we waited there because Graham had told me CP 2816 would be stopping there for servicing as well.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762477071(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762477937(square)[/flickr]<br />
We were not disappointed. We saw the train come in slowly, pass by, and stop in the siding. After it had passed, we drove to the other end of the siding, and watched it race westward. (The train was about two hours late, so they had a reason to move quickly.) We drove out to the highway, and saw the train&#8217;s smoke as we drove by it on the highway. We saw some other people we&#8217;d seen back in Calgary stop at the side of the highway to take more pictures.<br />
Finally, we stopped in Banff, and waited about halfway between the station and Bankhead. We had to wait a long, long time before we saw CP 2816&#8217;s lights. As CP 2816 was going on show at the station, the train stopped again not far from us for one last servicing before going in. This gave us a fantastic view, although the whistles did give you a bit of a scare &#8212; they were quite loud.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762480609(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4763119200(square)[/flickr]<br />
After meeting up with Graham at the station (it seemed only fair to thank him in person for the information), we had lunch at Bruno&#8217;s, and then headed back to Calgary. You slept from Canmore all the way home.<br />
On Saturday, you and I went to the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market, mostly so you could go to the jumping castle &#8212; probably your most favourite thing in town (after me, of course). You ate your mixed berry crepe almost as fast as I could eat my ham and cheese crepe. I swear it&#8217;s the only thing you eat quickly &#8212; everything else requires a pry bar and a shovel&#8230;<br />
When I asked what you wanted to do next, you said: &#8220;I want [to see the] giraffes!&#8221; So off we went to the zoo. We went though the dinosaurs, then over to the giraffes, zipped by the gorillas, and spent a lot of time at the playground (you love the playground, there). Then it was into the Australian  pavilion  (I was devastated to find that the nocturnal animal area is permanently closed), through the monkey house, and then over to the elephants (where we had hot dogs), zipped over to the carousel (just opened), before going through the Canadian Wilds (where you were completely obsessed with the prairie dogs).<br />
[flickr]photo:4763125998(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762491661(square)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:4762511327(square)[/flickr]<br />
For dinner, I took you to a Japanese restaurant. I found that your chopstick skills had degraded quite a lot &#8212; we&#8217;ll have to work on that. But you ate half of the edamame, a couple of avocado rolls, and even a piece of hamachi sashimi (well, it was nigiri sushi, but it was just plain easier to give you just the fish). You wouldn&#8217;t touch the miso soup (I&#8217;ll work on that, too). For your first shot, I was very proud of you.<br />
The next morning, we walked over to the #2 bus stop. You were ecstatic about riding the bus. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s from singing <em>The Wheels On The Bus</em> so much.   We went to the Silver Dragon restaurant, where we met up with my friend Tamara and her husband, Dan. There we ate dim sum (Mommy was rather annoyed that we went without her). It was so good. You ate buns, and pork dumplings, and quite a lot of deep fried squid. Yes, you ate squid. I kid you not. Mind you, as I&#8217;ve said to others, the squid tastes a lot like scrambled eggs. So I told you it was scrambled eggs. You couldn&#8217;t get enough.<br />
Following dim sum, you and I walked along the river over to Eau Claire Market (which really isn&#8217;t a market anymore &#8212; it&#8217;s mostly businesses and empty store space &#8212; nothing like it used to be), where you and I saw Toy Story 3. I cried a bit. You seemed to like it a lot, though. Especially anything with Woody.<br />
[flickr]photo:4762516489(square)[/flickr]<br />
In fact, you like Woody and Jesse (the Yodelling Cowgirl) so much, and because the Calgary Stampede is just around the corner, we walked over to Stephen Avenue afterwards to try and get you a cowgirl outfit. You&#8217;ve got the boots and jeans, but you need a hat and a shirt. Sadly, we were less than successful &#8212; no-one seemed to have a cowgirl shirt in your size.<br />
On the way home, much to our luck, we ran into Grandma on the bus (she was coming to our house, anyway &#8212; we just had really good timing). You had some fun with Grandma while I went off to get something for us to eat for dinner.<br />
In fact, I&#8217;m so tired from all of this excitement that it&#8217;s taken me a while to write all of this. But I hope you had fun, Monkey. I know I did.<br />
And now, I need to go to bed. &#8216;Cuz I&#8217;m really, really, <em>really</em> tired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, I went off to Japan to visit my friend Chris. I took along my (at the time) fancy digital camera: a Canon Pro 90 IS. Fancy in that it was big mega-pixels (for the time) and had an image stabiliser built-in (that&#8217;s what the &#8220;IS&#8221; stands for). Like I do now, I used it to document the heck out of my trip.<br />
One thing Canon had on its prosumer cameras at the time that they took out of the DSLR line was the panorama assist mode (I don&#8217;t think it exists in any of their models now &#8212; does it?). A handy feature, it let you create panoramic views by being able to line up your previous shot. Then you used some included software, and BOOM!, you had a panorama.<br />
Or that&#8217;s how it was supposed to work.<br />
<span id="more-1031"></span>It wasn&#8217;t perfect. And if you didn&#8217;t follow good practises, you ended up with somewhat sketchy pictures. Back then, I was still fairly new at all this, and my skills with the lens were sorely lacking. For example, I tried to use the fancy mode to do panoramas in both Akihabara and Shibuya in Japan:<br />

Canon Photostitch &#8212; the software included with my camera &#8212; did a reasonable job on well-aligned photos, but was not able to correct even slight mis-alignments. And if you don&#8217;t travel with a tripod &#8212; which I didn&#8217;t at the time &#8212; you were asking for trouble. Or really weird results.<br />
In truth, I was very upset when I got these pictures. I really wanted the panoramas. I spent hours trying to correct it. But the problem is mathematical, not image. I needed a better tool.<br />
Enter my old friend, Photoshop. (Is there anything Photoshop can&#8217;t do?) The Automate &gt; Photomerge feature is so handy, it&#8217;s almost frightening. Suck in a few pictures, and Photoshop goes to work on them. What do I end up with?<br />
Pictures that are light-years better. (End photos were slightly tweaked through Lightroom.)<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03526.JPG" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" width="300" /></a><br />
Our British Airways 747 to London:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03527.JPG" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" width="300" /></a><br />
The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03533.JPG" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03567.JPG" alt="A small, nameless Siberian village" width="300" /></a><br />
And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a><br />
We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a><br />
A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a><br />
Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a><br />
I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03674.JPG" alt="Get on the train!" width="300" /></a><br />
Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03675.JPG" alt="No Flowing Back" width="300" /></a><br />
One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03677.JPG" alt="Somewhere around the Hong Kong border" width="300" /></a><br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03692.JPG" alt="No Hawking" width="300" /></a><br />
Ferry traffic!<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03703.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a><br />

Jackie Chan apparently heavily sponsors California Fitness. He&#8217;s probably an owner.<br />

We had this at a sushi restaurant in Chiba. We thought it was some weird pickled eel. It was eggplant:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nothing like a little wandering around to make things interesting.<br />
I&#8217;ve been to Osaka once before &#8212; a few hours last year, when Jen and I came here. Mostly to see the Aquarium, mind you, but we did see a few other things.<br />
<span id="more-584"></span>Our hotel has got a great view &#8230; of the harbour. If that sort of thing interests you, then you&#8217;re in luck. The Hyatt is, otherwise, quite isolated. Thankfully, they have a free shuttlebus to the JR Osaka station. A little more convenient (although the route is anything but direct!) than trying to take all the trains.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03751.JPG" alt="A room. Sorta with a view. " width="300" /></a><br />
Destination: Domtomburi (and surrounding area). This is the major outdoor market zone. It&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s busy, it&#8217;s loud (lots of pachinko parlours), and it&#8217;s very Japanese. (Which is good, because if it was, say, Angolan, that might be a little weird.) We even found the area where every sushi restaurant in the area seems to buy its equipment (including the plastic food featured in the windows).<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03752.JPG" alt="In the shopping markets" width="300" /></a><br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03753.JPG" alt="Kitchen Stadium. Never did find Chen Kenichi, though..." width="300" /></a><br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03755.JPG" alt="Domtomburi" width="300" /></a><br />
And after a great deal of effort (and patience on Amy&#8217;s part, because I was no doubt becoming quite annoying about this), we found some Osaka &#8220;zushi&#8221;. This is sushi, but formed and cut into squares. It&#8217;s a different presentation, and I honestly expected it to be a bit more different than it ended up being. I won&#8217;t say I was disappointed, but I guess I had a higher expectation for it.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time I was in Japan (a little over a year ago), I&#8217;d wanted to go to Nara. I&#8217;d quite a bit about it, but just hadn&#8217;t gotten the chance to go. So when we planned this out, and happened to be spinning through Japan on our way home, it was a very fortunate happenstance that both of us wanted to be there.<br />
Nara, as it turns out, is a very neat little city. Make no mistake, this is most definitely no town. But it doesn&#8217;t feel large. At least, if you&#8217;re within the &#8220;walled&#8221; portion. (I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s an actual wall, but that&#8217;s what it looks like on the maps we&#8217;ve seen.)<br />
<span id="more-583"></span>Our trip there was an adventure and a half. First, shinkansen to Shin-Osaka, Nozomi-class. (There are three classes: Kodama, Hikari, and Nozomi. Although JR Rail Pass holders aren&#8217;t allowed on Nozomi, the cost to buy a ticket isn&#8217;t much different (maybe 300 yen) between them. And you save almost an hour.) Originally, we were to go to Kyoto, but Amy convinced me to go all the way to Shin-Osaka. Once there, we switched to a local train to Osaka station, then to a regional train that took us all the way out to Nara. From the moment we got off at Shin-Osaka, all the way to a taxi that we finally climbed into in Nara, we stood. My feet were KILLING me.<br />
We&#8217;re staying at a ryokan, a small traditional Japanese guest house. Apparently, it used to be a geisha house. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s Japanese geishas, or American geishas. (What&#8217;s the difference? A proper Japanese geisha is an entertainer. Their job was to placate and entertain powerful men who paid very highly for the services of a geisha. Despite beliefs, Japanese geishas were not prostitutes, unlike the American geishas. These were introduced by the U.S. Government after World War II as an effort to keep American soldiers from &#8220;disturbing&#8221; the Japanese people. These were prostitutes dressed up as geishas, and called as such for the exotic overtones.) I&#8217;d like to believe the house was a Japanese one. It&#8217;s nothing fancy &#8212; a pair of mattresses, a couple of chairs, and a noisy air conditioner. Toilets and showers are communal, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anyone around.<br />
Nara is full of temples. Aside from being a former capital (many Japanese cities seem to hold this title), this is still a religious centre. Thankfully, most of the neat stuff was in walking distance of the ryokan. (For the record, though, our &#8220;walking distance&#8221; is probably a lot further than some people&#8217;s definition. We&#8217;ve walked a <em>lot</em> in this trip.)<br />
Starting off at a pond near the Five Storied Pagoda, we found a healthy collection of turtles. Then we wandered through the Pagoda area and were introduced to the deer. Nara deer are &#8230; odd. They&#8217;re small, not as small as the ones on Miyajima Island near Hiroshima, but certainly smaller than the ones in Canada. They&#8217;re defined as &#8220;semi-wild&#8221;, meaning that while they are wild animals, they tolerate interaction with humans quite well. (Although there are a lot of signs telling you to be careful and not to enrage the deer.) It&#8217;s stuff like this that reminds me why many tourists in Banff (Bamf!) are told not to get too close to the elk.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03745.JPG" alt="Pond o' Turtles" width="300" /></a><br />
We were distracted by a rather nice park on the way to Tennoji Temple. Aside from the wonderful Japanese stone lanterns, the biggest attraction we saw was the botanical garden. Apparently designed off various literal works, the garden contains a wonderful collection of plants, arranged into very beautiful pockets of splendour. Of particular interest was a small red deck built over a lilypad-covered pond. The pond was home to a school of carp, which a trio of elderly photographers were taking turns snapping pictures.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03746.JPG" alt="Botanical Garden" width="300" /></a><br />
Tennoji Temple is quite impressive. Like other buildings I&#8217;ve been to that claim it&#8217;s &#8220;the largest wooden building in the world&#8221;, it&#8217;s big. Really big. And impressive. There&#8217;s a large Buddha that sits inside, sheltered by the building. Interestingly enough, the building is smaller than it once was (fire reconstruction), and the temple itself is smaller, having been reduced by similar damage.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03747.JPG" alt="Tennoji Temple" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around through various alleys and laneways (Nara has many that are very picturesque. You&#8217;ll see something interesting down nearly every road, it seems.)<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03748.JPG" alt="Nara Cultural Hell" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy finally found some Japanese yarn. I thought she was going to have kittens when she found it. She couldn&#8217;t decide, either.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03750.JPG" alt="Yarn, yarn, everywhere..." width="300" /></a><br />
I&#8217;d glad to have finally been to Nara. It&#8217;s a nice little place. If you&#8217;re thinking of coming to Japan, give it a thought. It&#8217;s an easy trip from Osaka &#8230; so long as you&#8217;re not carrying all your bags with you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tokyo is a wonderful city. Even in the rain. Despite a delayed start (we were up late &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t help that Chris and I yak a lot), we soon found ourselves in Ginza, walking through the mist-like rain in search of not much except yarn (Amy&#8217;s got a project she&#8217;s trying to finish).<br />
We went through the sweet electronic sanctity of the Sony Showroom [insert drool marks on the screen here], then over to the Apple store (four floors of pure industrial design nirvana), before crossing Ginza dori in search of, well, food. Amy spied a small sign that led us down an alley barely wide enough for us to walk, then down a set of barely-marked stairs into a basement restaurant that served some darn fine raumen, and some pretty funky dumplings.<br />
<span id="more-582"></span>Next to that was a paper store. I think Amy&#8217;s heart raced pretty much the whole time she was in there from the paper overload. Too much to choose from, and we&#8217;re almost out of money.<br />
Matsuya and Mitsukoshi (two massive Japanese department stores) were next. But the illusive yarn Amy needs was not to be found. So we went to the food floors in Mitsukoshi to see what samples we could find. There was quite a lot.<br />
We caught a subway over to Akehabara. This is geek heaven when it comes to all things &#8220;batteries not included&#8221;. [Insert more drool marks on the screen here.] Then it was over to Shibuya. The only real things to see there, aside from Shibuya itself, was the HMV, where I hoped to snag some of the music my cousin Jen had asked me to find. I found the artists, but sadly, all sold out. (Go figure.) Sorry, Jen, I&#8217;ll have to keep looking.<br />
We were late meeting up with Chris and his friends Jessica and Alex for a late dinner in Chiba. They didn&#8217;t mind at all. Shinichiro was out again (he&#8217;d come out last night, too) as was another of Chris&#8217; japanese friends (whose name I don&#8217;t want to screw up by spelling incorrectly).<br />
We&#8217;ll be off for Nara before too long. Then Osaka, then home.<br />
Three more sleeps!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I can&#8217;t even call this a &#8220;last day&#8221;. Yesterday, really, was our last day. Today is the packing/travelling day.<br />
And the day to say goodbye to dear friends. I hate leaving friends behind.<br />
<span id="more-348"></span>Chris is one of my dearest, closest friends. (Of course, you already know that.) When he moved to Japan almost two years ago, it hurt to have him leave. When Therese and Stuart moved to Montreal, it was hard to handle. But as I stood in the doorway of the train today, I looked back at my friend &#8212; my brother &#8212; and wondered when I will see him again.<br />
There is never enough time. Too many things happening, and too much distance separating us. I miss living with Chris. I miss the knowing glances and mouthed expressions we could give each other that conveyed meaning on a level only we knew.<br />
But such is life. Life is change, life is motion. It has to continue, lest life stop.<br />
Chris didn&#8217;t come to the airport with us, but Kaz was kind enough to guide us. When we arrived, we&#8217;d found that our flight time had changed. We had originally been booked for an 18:35 departure, but had been rescheduled for a 15:30 departure &#8230; or so I&#8217;d thought. The boards read a 17:15 departure, so I began to wonder if Air Canada had changed the times on us again, and not informed us. In retrospect, I think we&#8217;re okay, but I&#8217;m not 100% on that yet.<br />
Normally, a chance in flight times wouldn&#8217;t worry me. But I have to catch a flight in Calgary to take me to Kelowna, and I can&#8217;t afford to miss that flight. At the time, I started to worry. I had based my flight from Calgary on the changed (and perceived) time of 15:30. If we were now leaving Japan later, I might not make my Kelowna flight.<br />
Either way, we were at the airport far too early to determine what was going on, so it was just a matter of waiting. Putting the bags into storage (we had almost two hours to wait until we could check in), we went in search of lunch.<br />
One of the restaurants offered beef don, or a relative facsimile thereof. Jen was dying for beef, so this is where we went. Kaz and I had more traditional Japanese meals. It was a way of using up the remaining 2,000 yen I still had. (As it turns out, not such a wise move, since we had to pay to get the bags back, which was 1,500 yen.)<br />
We did a bit of shopping. Well, looking around, anyway. The only thing we really needed to buy still was a bottle of sake for Uncle Mike. But Terminal 2 really didn&#8217;t offer anything particularly interesting. And as we had time to kill, anyway, we went over to Terminal 1.<br />
I finally figured out why I&#8217;d been so disoriented when we arrived two weeks ago. Last year, I came in at Terminal 1 (see [[My Trip to Japan, Calgary to Yotsukaido]]), which I think is a lot nicer than Terminal 2. It was quite clear when we got close enough to see inside.<br />
We returned to Terminal 2 to check in. This is when we got another nasty bit of news: Jen and I were not sharing the same flight coming from Vancouver to Calgary. We had set it up that way so we didn&#8217;t have to worry about the flight. In fact, there supposedly weren&#8217;t any available seats at all on the flights and we didn&#8217;t really have reservations. I urged them to correct that sitation, but the best we could get was two flights over three hours apart. This is something I&#8217;ll have to sort out in Vancouver.<br />
Once checked in, we had to start heading to the flight. Kaz walked us to the security gate, where we had to say goodbye to her. Kaz and Jen had grown close (mostly as a result of yesterday&#8217;s rather interesting shopping spree). Kaz is my best friend&#8217;s wife. I don&#8217;t know her nearly as well as perhaps I should, but if she&#8217;s able to capture his heart, I know I will miss her as much as I miss him.<br />
The flight boarded only a few minutes later than scheduled, but far in advance of us departing the gate. The flight isn&#8217;t completely full, so is rather comfortable. Hopefully, the flight will be a short one, so we don&#8217;t have to sit down for too long.<br />
Jen and I chuckled a bit at the first movie. Not just because it is a funny movie, but because it was very appropriate for all the Japanese/English mishaps we&#8217;ve had throughout our trip.<br />
&#8220;Lost in Translation.&#8221;<br />
&#8212;-<br />
The plane arrived more or less on time. We hustled from the plane, bypassing many of the passengers (they were taking the escalators, we took the adjoining stairs) and getting into the immigration line. We had to go through Canadian Immigration in Vancouver before heading to Calgary.<br />
This was the only time &#8212; *only* time &#8212; throughout the entire trip that someone asked my relation to Jen in an official capacity. I had legal documents on me that stated that I was Jen&#8217;s legal guardian, but never had to show them to anyone. Even the clerk at Immigration didn&#8217;t ask to see them, but said that I might have to show them.<br />
I never had to.<br />
We had to collect our bags and go through Customs (which amounted to them taking our form of Declaration, not even saying &#8220;thank you&#8221;) and check them in again for our connecting flight.<br />
It was the connecting flight that was a bit of an issue. As you might recall, we found out at Narita airport that Jen and I were not on the same flight. This had me mildy irked, because we were supposed to be on the same flight. It&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t trust Jen to get back to Calgary on her own, but I was supposed to be her legal guardian, and wanted to make sure she got back to her parents.<br />
Fortunately, the flight I was on was not completely full, and the Air Canada clerk was reasonably certain that Jen would be able to get on the flight. She set Jen up as stand-by, and even checked her bag to Calgary (so even if Jen didn&#8217;t make it, her bag would). With that, we went off to our gate.<br />
I got pulled over at security again. I always seem to get pulled over in North America. It&#8217;s all my freaking electronics. Japan didn&#8217;t care. Maybe they&#8217;ve got better technology. I mean, they&#8217;ve got vending machines that will take bills upside down, backwards, and probably crumpled beyond recognition. They&#8217;ve gotta have better scanning machines than we do.<br />
At the gate, after giving the clerk a few minutes, we asked if Jen could get on the flight, and if it was possible if we could sit together. The clerk, originally seeming a little harsh, turned out to be quite congenial, and settled our last hurdle quite easily.<br />
At that point, I called Aunt Brenda. (I had my cell phone with me for in-Canada communications upon my return.) I let her know we were on the 12:00 (PST) flight from Vancouver, getting into Calgary around 14:30. She was quite happy to hear we&#8217;d be home soon, and said she&#8217;d meet us there.<br />
The flight was quite hot. Unlike our A340 plane, our little A320 was quite warm, even with the air vents cranked all the way open. But it didn&#8217;t really matter. Soon, we&#8217;d be at home. Thankfully, the flight went quickly (that happens when you sleep for half of it &#8230; or all of it, in Jen&#8217;s case), and soon we were exiting Gate A to the awaiting arms of Uncle Mike, Aunt Brenda, and Nana.<br />
Now, you&#8217;d think at this point that I&#8217;d be somewhat relieved to unload the responsibility for handling Jen back to her parents, right? Not really. It was at that point that I realized that Jen hadn&#8217;t really been that hard to handle. Aside from having to curb her manga-buying sprees, and encouraging her to see more things (which was more trouble than I would have thought), she was very easy to get along with. But then, we already had a good relationship.<br />
Jen immediately became a chatterbox, telling Brenda and Nana about the trip &#8212; almost entirely randomly-selected portions &#8212; while Mike and I exchanged a few thoughts about my perspective. All this while waiting for the bags to come out. Then it was back to their place to unload.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this tale should end. But it doesn&#8217;t. While Jen&#8217;s journey was over, mine still had a bit left to it. I had another flight to catch. I&#8217;m now in Kelowna. Why would I be coming to Kelowna? Two words:<br />
David Bowie.<br />
Remember when I said that if David Bowie was returning to Canada anytime soon that I&#8217;d go to see him? (See [[David Bowie Plays the Calgary Saddledome]].) I wasn&#8217;t kidding. A couple of months ago, during my only sick day of the year (so far, anyway), Tamara had burst into my room in a near state of ecstacy because David Bowie was playing in Kelowna. In an auditorium that holds only 5,000 people.<br />
Naturally, we were going.<br />
This was after I&#8217;d booked my flights to Japan and back, and had Jen booked in. This meant I had to catch another flight from Calgary to Kelowna. With WestJet, not a particularly huge deal. (The flight cost about as much as the ticket to David Bowie, at least before adding on all those ridiculous taxes.)<br />
I passed out in my chair on the plane (an aisle seat) mere moments after doing up my seat belt. I vaguely remember the word &#8220;juice&#8221;, and awoke only when the plane slapped the tarmac at Kelowna. I dozed until the plane finally stopped. I was soon met by my roommate Tamara, her boyfriend Dan, and her friend Andrea. (They&#8217;d driven out earlier in the day.)<br />
Our first stop was the White Spot, a BC-favourite for restaurants. Not one of mine (don&#8217;t really care for the place), but it was food and it was cheap. That was enough for me. Then it was to the hotel (the Royal Anne Hotel, situated in beautiful downtown Kelowna, a mere block from the lake, and four blocks from Prospera Place, the site for tomorrow&#8217;s David Bowie concert) to dump the bags.<br />
We went bar-hopping, in search of something fairly decent. The sad part is that most of Kelowna&#8217;s downtown has either really seedy biker bars (read: strip clubs, and we all know how much I like those places) or yuppie pubs. We weren&#8217;t thrilled by any of them. We finally gave up around 21:00 and went back to the hotel.<br />
I shaved off two weeks&#8217; worth of beard (much to my delight &#8212; the damn thing was driving me crazy) while Tamara and Andrea watched &#8220;Princess Bride&#8221; on the TV. Dan had already passed out. The four of us were asleep before the movie was over (and we only came in halfway-through).<br />
God knows I needed the rest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why had I gone to Shinagawa to kill time? Simply put, it was far enough away from Tsukiji that walking alone would eat up some time, but not so far that I would be exhausted by the time I got to my destination. I had originally thought Shibuya, but a quick glance at a map ruled it out immediately.<br />
To add to my time getting to Tsukiji, I also planned to walk to Tokyo Tower for some night photographs. Beyond that, I was making up everything as I went. That wasn&#8217;t too hard, considering I didn&#8217;t really know where I was going. I wasn&#8217;t looking at a map, I was just using my sense of direction (usually very reliable) and certain landmarks to know where I was.<br />
<span id="more-347"></span>It&#8217;s almost creepy to think that I&#8217;ve been in Tokyo long enough (this year and last) that I know actual landmarks.<br />
The streets of downtown Tokyo are rather interesting at night. Despite what movies have shown, the majority of Tokyo is quiet. Areas such as Shibuya will be raucous most of the night, but areas like the one I was walking through are surprisingly desolate. Aside from bursts of traffic, 24 hour convenience stores, drunk people either stumbling down the road or urinating in planters, and the odd bicyclist, the streets are very serene. There is a strange, almost zen-like quality about Tokyo at night.<br />
I found Tokyo Tower rather easily. (I stopped along the way only once, at a 7-11 to get a Coke and a salmon onigiri to keep my energy up.) Not by looking at a map, but because it&#8217;s very easy to see at a distance. The lights stay on all night, so make for an ideal photography subject. I know this because I wasn&#8217;t the only one taking pictures of it. It&#8217;s wonderful to observe not only at a distance but also close-up. It would be even nicer to go directly underneath, as you can with the Eiffel Tower (which Tokyo Tower is modelled after), but someone decided to put a rather large building right underneath the tower, ruining a chance of that.<br />
Leaving three drunk Japanese men taking strange photos of themselves in front of the tower with a keitai, I continued my walk to Tsukiji.<br />
Quite poorly, I might add.<br />
Not really thinking about which direction I&#8217;d been going in (I cut through Shibya Park, pausing to take photos at the shrine in the dark), I ended up accidentally doubling back on part of my route. I cursed myself when I realized that I&#8217;d done. But at least I&#8217;d still had a good walk and used more time.<br />
I found my way back to the World Trade Center Building, and continued down to Hama-Rikyu Gardens, which is wedged between Hammamatsucho and Tsukiji. I walked along the north side of Hama-Rikyu, trying to avoid the plethora of construction that seemed to run every few hundred metres. I can only assume Tokyo runs their road construction crews at night as not to interfere with traffic during the day.<br />
Construction crews in Tokyo, and probably over the parts of Japan that we saw, are models of people-use. There are always two to three people (almost always men &#8212; I only ever saw one woman on the crews) who direct pedestrians. One at either end of the construction zone, and one in the middle, if the zone is quite long. There&#8217;s usually at least one foreman, and a number of workers, depending on what&#8217;s happening. All wear safety vests (those near vehicular traffic have vests with blinking lights) and hardhats.<br />
The roads leading into Tsukiji were already lined with trucks, delivering produce, waiting to pick up produce, or in the process of being loaded. (The market is so busy and overloaded that the roads immediately next to the market are filled with loading equipment in the wee hours of the morning.)<br />
Inside the market, the level of activity was far beyond anything I&#8217;d ever expected. Beehives aren&#8217;t this busy. Forklifts carry large flats of crates, smaller three-wheeled carts whizz around (often haphazardly) with all manners of cargo. I really had to watch where I was going as not to be hit by anything.<br />
That&#8217;s the first rule when visiting Tsukiji market: Your presence is tolerated, though not necessarily welcome. Reality: This is a place of business, no different than your office building or construction site. These people aren&#8217;t a Disney show, this is the real thing. If you go there, you stay out of their way. Those who bring Tsukiji to life do not have the time for mindless tourists who want to get in the way because they are tourists. Imagine if they got in the way of you trying to do your job&#8230;<br />
Despite the activity, the market was only just starting to come to life. Most of the vendors hadn&#8217;t yet arrived, and the buyers would be behind them. Already, however, tuna was beginning to be laid out for the auction. The frozen tuna, each weighing a couple hundred pounds or more, were dumped unceremoniously on the floor, almost as one would dump a cord of wood. Frozen completely stiff, you had to look hard to realize that this was fish, and no something else.<br />
The pre-packaged area was already well underway, the massive stacks of styrofoam containers being arranged and rearranged, full of almost every conceivable (and edible) seafood, ready to be sent to stores for sale. These were mostly uninteresting to me. I was more for the tuna auction, and the live (or recently alive, but not processed) produce.<br />
I wandered around until almost 4:00, at which point the sheer insanity of the whizzing carts and constant dodging of people finally sent me out of the market in search of a bit of rest. A nearby Lawson&#8217;s provided a quick snack and a Coke for a much-needed caffeine burst.<br />
In the scant half-hour that I was gone, most of the fishmongers had arrived and were in operation. Live fish were being sorted and crated, cut and filleted, and packaged for shipping. Ice vendors were chewing up huge blocks (at nearly CDN$27 per block, from what I could tell), and the fresh tuna was laid out for inspection. Also arrived were tourists, bussed in for the auction.<br />
I felt oddly superior. I had been there since earlier that morning, had stayed up late so I could experience this. The rest came with tour groups. Most blatantly ignored the signs that forebade entry into the auction warehouses without permission (it was quite easy to see through the door).<br />
On the auction floor, the fish had been prepared for inspection. The frozen tuna had portions cut open so buyers could inspect for quality. The fresh tuna had slices cut off the end for inspection, and the tails (previously cut off, but kept) were available to check the quality of the meet.<br />
Inside the massive rooms were hundreds of people: buyers, sellers, and what I can only assume were the officials that kept the whole thing running. Buyers were easy to spot &#8212; they wear hats with blue cards that denote who they are buying for. I don&#8217;t believe the tuna purchased at Tsukiji is destined for canning, I think most is destined for processing of some kind &#8212; especially the fresh tuna (much of that is bought for sushi restaurants). Admittedly, though, I&#8217;m not really sure where it all goes. Other than it goes very quickly.<br />
The auctions begin at 5:20 in almost all the four warehouses (three frozen, one fresh). Tuna is on the ground floor, and I gather other kinds are bought and sold in rooms above. The tuna auctions are fast. One of the sellers rings a bell (most sellers have a unique bell ring) that signifies selling is about to being. Those buyers wishing to engage in the sale all come over, and the fish are sold individually, and very rapidly. A single sale might take five seconds or less. Larger fish fetch high prices (one massive beast was hungrily viewed by five or six business men, dressed in their finest).<br />
Unfortunately, tourists here tend to get in the way. Once sales are complete, carts immediately appear to whisk the tuna away. (Frozen tuna is often carted to one of the fishmonger stalls, many of which are equipped with bandsaws for the sole purpose of cutting up tuna.) One particular putz was oblivious to the work going on around him, while talking on this cellphone. I wanted to go over and smack him, because one of the fishmongers was almost yelling at him to get out of the way.<br />
Putz.<br />
Auctions over, I wandered around the market, now in full swing. Fish of almost every variety was in sight, much of it still alive. I watched in amazement, becaue I knew that all of it would be gone within six hours. That kind of efficiency in a place so small is unknown in North America. Tsukiji is huge, make no mistake, but it could easily be twice the size to handle all the needs. That&#8217;s what fascinates me so much about it &#8212; unique in the world for the role it fulfills, and few people ever really think about what it does for life in Japan.<br />
I found my way to the sushi restaurant Chris and I had gone to last year (see [[My Trip to Japan, Tsukiji Fish Market]]) for a bit of breakfast. Although you can get good sushi no matter where you are in Tsukiji (including a couple of 24 hour sushi sens in the Outer Market), this particular place I rather liked. Not only were the staff very kind and pleasant, I really liked the green tea and especially the miso soup.<br />
And not knowing Japanese isn&#8217;t a problem. They know enough English to offer you a set (definitely the best way to get it), and tell you the price. (They&#8217;ll also tell you which pieces don&#8217;t need soy sauce.) Although small for what I&#8217;ve been known to eat for sushi, it was exactly what I needed to have for a meal.<br />
With that, I bade Tsukiji farewell, and headed towards Tokyo station. It was still early, so I wasn&#8217;t going to head back to Yotsukaido right away. First, I thought I&#8217;d kill some time at the Imperial Palace, specifically the East Gardens.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t planned to go to the main gate with the double-bridge. But the light from the rising sun and the relative clarity of the skies (Japan seems to be hugged with perpetual smog, no matter where you go), that I couldn&#8217;t pass up a few photos of things I had taken pictures of last year.<br />
As I wandered around to the gate for the East Gardens, I realized that it was Friday. The Gardens, sadly, are closed on Mondays and Fridays, meaning that I would have to wait until the next time I come to Japan to see them. One day, perhaps.<br />
With that, I returned to the station and boarded a train for Chiba. I fell asleep even before the train had left the underground portion of the line. Switching to a local train in Chiba, I almost didn&#8217;t wake up in time for Yotsukaido. I didn&#8217;t take a bus back to the apartment, deciding to save some yen and walk the way back. It gave me my third wind.<br />
Chris was awake when I got to the apartment. We talked a bit about the things I&#8217;d seen and done. Kaz soon came out and the three of us chatted. Kaz made rice and miso soup for breakfast. I could hardly pass up the chance to eat a little more. The activity of the day so far had taken a lot out o me. Finally, Jen woke up and proceeded to shower. Chris tortured me with a taped episode of the live-action Sailor Moon TV show. It you thought the animated version was bad, check out the live action one.<br />
I pray it never comes to North America.<br />
Shortly afterwards, I went to bed. It was just after noon, and I really needed some sleep. I set my alarm and dropped off&#8230;<br />
&#8230;awaking to a loud clatter of doors, bags, and voices. At first, I had no idea where I was. For a brief moment, I wasn&#8217;t even sure who *I* was. But it came back very quickly, like a wave rolling onto the shore. Jen and Kaz were returning from what sounded like shopping. But it was already dark outside &#8230; I&#8217;d only planned to sleep for a couple of hours.<br />
I&#8217;d slept for over five.<br />
We were going to Chiba that night, to dinner with friends. I showered to prepare. I told Kaz to tell Chris we&#8217;d meet him at the station for 20:00 (you have to do that with him). We caught a bus, met up with Chris, and the four of us headed to Chiba.<br />
Shinichiro had called ahead and reserved a table for six at the couches upstairs. Although a bit warm up there, it was more comfortable for eating and chatting. We were quite early, though, and would have to wait for Shinichiro and Riku to arrive. That gave us time to order some drinks, have an appetizer or two, and chat.<br />
Soon, all six of us had assembled, and we were in full chatting and eating modes. Laughter, jokes, and a few English and Japanese lessons flew around. Naome joined us about an hour later, and the seven of us cajoled until well after midnight.<br />
I had only barely known Shinichiro before Chris&#8217; wedding, having met him the first night I was in Japan (see [[My Trip to Japan, Calgary to Yotsukaido]]). Now, he was a friend, as much as Kaz or Naome had become. People I would be more than happen to open my home to, should they decide to ever visit Canada. I will miss them.<br />
We returned by taxi, and I went right to bed. Long nap or not, I needed rest.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We got up a bit later than I&#8217;d hoped for, mostly because I&#8217;d accidentally turned off the alarm instead of snoozing it.<br />
We took the first train we could get to into Tokyo. I stood, wedged in a space between the door and the side of the bench, watching the scenery pass. At the time, I had thought this to be my last trip into Tokyo. Having been to Japan twice in two years, I can&#8217;t honestly imagine returning any time soon.<br />
<span id="more-346"></span>We switched to the Yamanote line after getting to Tokyo, then to the O-Edo subway line. We were going to Tsukiji market, and walking (though great exercise) was something I was trying to avoid. Jen was not feeling particularly genke (Japanese for &#8220;energetic&#8221; &#8212; if you hear a Japanese say: &#8220;genke deska&#8221;, they are asking you how you are doing, it&#8217;s a common greeting that literally translated means &#8220;are you energetic&#8221;), and I didn&#8217;t want to make her walk too much.<br />
Arriving at the market, Jen didn&#8217;t honestly believe that we were there. At first glance, it doesn&#8217;t look like a market at all. Near the main entrance, it&#8217;s trucks, forklifts, and countless styrofoam containers. It&#8217;s only once you get past the stall shops that you can see something that makes a little sense. But only when you&#8217;re in the fishmonger stalls inside the market building that you can really see it.<br />
Sadly, by the time we got there, the market was closing down for the day. Most of the buyers and sellers were gone, the tuna long since vanished. Most of the stalls were vacant, showing no signs of any recent use. There simply wasn&#8217;t much to see.<br />
We did a quick circuit of the inside, and left by the east entrance, passing by the south side of the Tsukiji outer market. We were in search of the Ginza area. Before leaving the apartment that morning, I&#8217;d decided that we needed to stop into the Sony building, and witness the newest in Sony consumer electronics. I had no idea if we&#8217;d see anything we hadn&#8217;t already seen in Akehabara, but it couldn&#8217;t hurt to look.<br />
We were half-blindly wandering around. Only once did I look at a map, just to verify that we hadn&#8217;t, in fact, missed the correct road to find the Sony building.<br />
In the process of wandering, we found two things we hadn&#8217;t really been searching for. The first was an ice cream cone (soft serve). That wasn&#8217;t unusual on it&#8217;s own, but the flavour was odd. Black in colour, we had assumed black sesame. However, it&#8217;s just as likely the flavour was squid ink, since we couldn&#8217;t place the taste at all.<br />
The second was a teapot. One of our instructions was to find a cast iron teapot for Aunt Brenda. Not a particularly hard task, but we didn&#8217;t really know what we&#8217;d find when we looked. The one we eventually bought has a red patina of sorts, but one that you might almost miss in dimmer light. We hope it&#8217;s a good pot.<br />
Downtown Tokyo is a strange place. Not all roads have names, some roads have more than one name, some roads seem to only have some sections named, or have different sections with different names. I was looking for Ginza 4-chome (one of eight major north-south roads running through Ginza), on which we&#8217;d find Sony. When we finally found the name of the road we were on, it was Ginza 5-chome.<br />
We&#8217;d overshot our goal by a block. But as it turns out, this was a fortunate thing. As we reached the major east-west road in Ginza, we found the Apple store.<br />
I know this doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but the Apple store opened to tremendous fanfare, with line-ups that had run, quite literally, for blocks. The line-ups were long gone, and it was time to take a bit of a gander.<br />
The building is divided into five floors. The first is home and professional products, the second photographic needs, the third is an Internet cafe, the fourth a theatre, and the fifth various accessories and software. It&#8217;s a small store. So small that the only way to get between floors is by elevator. The elevators are totally automatic, running without having to press buttons for the floors at all.<br />
We headed west to 4-chome, and turned north towards the railway tracks. A block away, we found the Sony building. It&#8217;s an unassuming place, particularly odd for a company with such influence and power in the entertainment and electronics industries.<br />
From the first floor, spiralling up to the third, is a showroom of Sony products and technologies, broken only on a &#8220;floor between the first and second&#8221; that features a BMW &#8220;store&#8221;. (It has a car in there. I have no idea how on earth they got a car in there. Maybe by taking out the windows, but that just doesn&#8217;t seem right.)<br />
We started on the first floor (a massive video wall showcased a new product &#8212; a bipedal robot capable of standing back up if it falls over), then took an elevator to the third floor (we were a little apprehensive about going through the BMW store at first).<br />
There was little in the store that we not had not seen before. About the only thing that I saw that truly impressed me was a remote control system built for use with the Sony WEGA plasma TV systems. It&#8217;s more than just a mere remote control, however. You can surf the web, find TV channels and video signals, &#8220;throw&#8221; them onto the big screen, or alternatively capture them back to the remote. It&#8217;s a pretty slick device, and I&#8217;m more than a little afraid to find out how much it costs.<br />
We circled down, perusing the other wares, finding nothing else of real interest. Eventually, we exited back into the cooler outside air. We walked down to the Shimbashi JR station, about 3/4 of a kilometre from the Sony building. From there, a Yamanote train to Harajuku.<br />
By this time, Jen&#8217;s unwellness had turned into a full migraine. She moved slowly, and deliberately. She barely had the energy to walk from the station, down Takeshita St. to Meiji-dori, and back. (Maybe a kilometre, all told.) We did stop into a couple of stores, and did have lunch at a restaurant that featured ton-katsu (breaded pork cutlets).<br />
We headed back to Chiba and Yotsukaido. I tried to see if we could catch an NEX train &#8212; I&#8217;ve wanted to ride one for a long time &#8212; but we couldn&#8217;t get one that stopped at Chiba anytime soon. We had to take the Yamanote back to Tokyo station, and then a regular rapid Sobu train that went directly to Yotsukaido (saving us the additional train at Chiba).<br />
Kaz was out with her friend and Chris was at work. Having no key, we had to stop in briefly at the school to pick up Chris&#8217; key. We then hopped a bus back to the apartment, where we relaxed.<br />
It was then that I made my decision. I wasn&#8217;t going to be denied seeing a fish auction at Tsukiji. I needed to see it. Not just because of sheer interest, but also because the present market won&#8217;t exist in a couple of years &#8212; it&#8217;s being replaced by a newer one elsewhere in Tokyo harbour. For me, it was a case of now or never.<br />
This was a trip I would do alone. I knew Jen wouldn&#8217;t want to do the overnight in Tokyo, going without sleep, and wandering around in the market for at least a couple of hours. Although I wasn&#8217;t too keen on leaving her behind (alone, too, since neither Chris nor Kaz were home when I left), I headed to the bus just before 22:00, and caught the first train to downtown Tokyo.<br />
This is my last trip into Tokyo for the foreseeable future. Unless there is a pressing need for me to return, I doubt I&#8217;ll be back for a number of years. I had thought about that fact this morning. But not on this trip in. Rather, I slept. Well, as much as I could, considering I was rather excited about being downtown, wandering around at will, effectively killing time until I could see something at Tsukiji.<br />
The market officially opens around midnight, but things generally don&#8217;t start moving until about 2:00. The actual tuna auction isn&#8217;t until 5:20. And with train service ending at midnight, the only way I could see the auction was to do something until there was something worth seeing at Tsukiji.<br />
This led me to the Shinagawa station, courtesy of the Yamanote line. There, I took a couple pictures on the platform (streams of late-running salarymen heading in the direction of home), then headed out the exit into the night air. My rail pass has expired, it will serve no more purpose. Tonight, I am on my own.</p>
