										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Room is huge and darn near packed. I get the feeling this is gonna be a good one. I think I&#8217;m going to have to type quickly for this one.<br />
<span id="more-937"></span>Presenter: Jacob West (Fortify Software)</p>
<ul>
<li>Jacob runs the security research group</li>
<li>First off, the ubiquitous &#8220;what is Ajax&#8221; shtick</li>
<li>It&#8217;s trivial to make the mistake, such as echoing a request parameter (easy to slip scripting into the request string)</li>
<li>There are over 400 JavaScript CVE (Common Vulnerability Enumeration) problems</li>
<li>Lots of different libraries, but few actually get them &#8220;right&#8221;. GWT and Atlas are the two best.</li>
<li>Examples of bad Ajax:
<ul>
<li>MySpace allowed input of subset of HTML, which included poorly formatted HTML (java\nscript) to execute code; Samy worm brought down MySpace</li>
<li>Port scanning behind firewalls
<ul>
<li>request images from internal IPs (192.168.x.x) &#8212; if timer doesn&#8217;t time out, you know a server is there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jikto
<ul>
<li>Billy Hoffman built a vulnerability scanner in JS</li>
<li>Looks for XSS, uses Google as a proxy to bypass same origin policy
<ul>
<li>Loaded his script, and the victim&#8217;s page inside Google Translate, where they became the same domain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allowed to operate as a worm by inserting it as a snippet into a vulnerability</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No new vulnerabilities &#8212; XSS has existed a long time &#8212; just better exploits</li>
<li>Basic rule: echoing parameters recieved through URL strings is pretty much as bad as it gets</li>
<li>Input validations on the client side can be a serious risk &#8212; important that validation is handled carefully</li>
<li>Dirty-data shooters use known exploits, SQL injection, etc. that use Web 1.0 conventions to show exploits
<ul>
<li>Looks like conventional testing software</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross-Site Request Forgery allows attacker to submit request on behalf of the victim
<ul>
<li>It can make requests, but can&#8217;t see the data (security remains intact for responses); it hopes the attack is malicious</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JavaScript hijacking
<ul>
<li>Builds on CSRF</li>
<li>Breaks confientiality through loophole in SOP</li>
<li>Has some very subtle approaches that include modifying the constructor</li>
<li>NOTE: Need to engage a couple of brains on this for white paper; there are some potentially serious dangers I think we&#8217;re not handling well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prevent CSRF
<ul>
<li>Require unique tokens to allow execution</li>
<li>Default to POST not enough, nor checking known HTTP header (e.g. referrer) not enough</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prevent execution of JavaScript
<ul>
<li>while(1);/* &#8230; */, etc. at the beginning of the returning scripts to ensure they won&#8217;t run</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>State of the frameworks
<ul>
<li>Most do NOT prevent hijacking (including Prototype, jQuery)</li>
<li>When contact, most of the libs didn&#8217;t care</li>
<li>JSON standard doesn&#8217;t cover any security, and Fortify&#8217;s suggestions have been largely decried as unnecessary and/or bad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libs fixed:
<ul>
<li>Dojo 0.4.3 (JSON only, not JS), DWR 2.0, Prototype 1.5.1</li>
<li>All use the comment trick (/* &#8230; */) to protect the code</li>
<li>GWT, Mochikit, Script.aculo.us are coming soon</li>
<li>Microsoft and Yahoo said they will not fix it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are ways of setting up tests to check for vulnerabilities; they are non-trivial, but important in cases of transactional Ajax</li>
<li>Frameworks need to put more security in them to prevent hijacking</li>
<li>Need better web standards
<ul>
<li>cookies need to be HTTP-only headers</li>
<li>browsers have to distinguish between scripts from different domains</li>
<li>Note: Flash has most of these issues already addressed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Result: mashups aren&#8217;t secure. Maps okay, but confidential data is vulnerable</li>
</ul>

[[Bank of Montreal, I hate your security|I already hate BMO&#8217;s online security.]] Now I hate it more, if it is in fact possible to hate something more than &#8220;totally&#8221;.<br />
I just wanted to into my account. Nothing serious. But the password they made me assign apparently has changed, or is something completely different than I can remember. It&#8217;s not like I already have 8,349,204 passwords that I need to remember (thank you, Sarbanes-Oxley) and I must&#8217;ve made something up on the spot, wrote it down and then immediately burned the paper without looking at what I wrote.<br />
That must&#8217;ve been it. No way it could be BMO. Not a chance.<br />
Augh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oh. My. Lord.<br />
I haven&#8217;t been this pissed off in a very, very long time. I actually yelled at the poor person on the phone trying to help me. It&#8217;s not her fault. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.bmo.com">Bank of Montreal</a>. Who obviously has <strong>NO FUCKING CLUE</strong> what it&#8217;s like to live in the digital age.<br />
Allow me to elaborate&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-860"></span>BMO (the short form of Bank of Montreal) recently introduced new security procedures for their online banking. In addition to your card number and PIN, you choose an image and provide a password. (This is all to prevent phishing.) I welcomed this, since I had similar functionality on my <a href="http://www.ingdirect.ca/">ING</a> account for a couple of years.<br />
So, choose an image, provide a little info, toss in a password. No problem.<br />
Until I came back. Suddenly, my previously wonderful password doesn&#8217;t work. No idea why. Could swear I&#8217;ve got the right one. Try again. And again. And suddenly, I get a page telling me that my card is locked (thankfully, only online) and to call BMO to have it unlocked.<br />
Which I got around to today. And boy, I can&#8217;t think of a worse experience. Ever.<br />
When you need access to personal financial information through your institution, you generally get asked the Big 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Birthday</li>
<li>Address</li>
<li>Phone number</li>
<li>Social Insurance (or Social Security) Number</li>
<li>Mother&#8217;s maiden name</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, admittedly, anyone wanting to steal your identity could dig this information up and put it to nefarious means. So to that extent, I see that BMO&#8217;s approach for more information is necessary.<br />
Their additional questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What investments do you have? (I have none with BMO, so this question is invalid)</li>
<li>What are your monthly mortgage payments?</li>
<li>What were the last three transactions in your account &#8212; including the name of the institution and the dollar amount?</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to get at least two of those right in order to be validated as me. Problem: <em>I DON&#8217;T HAVE ACCESS TO MY FUCKING ACCOUNT!</em>  So how the hell am I supposed to know?<br />
No, I don&#8217;t memorise <strong>every bloody number</strong> that goes in and out of my account. That&#8217;s what <em>monthly statements</em> are for. Or, better yet, the online banking website that <em>I don&#8217;t have access to!</em> I don&#8217;t want to know what my monthly mortgage payments are &#8212; I just want to know that they&#8217;re being paid, and that my mortgage is being paid down.<br />
This is the digital age, folks. People actively try not to know numbers. I can&#8217;t count the number of people I know who don&#8217;t know their own <em>phone numbers</em>, let alone their last three transactions. Besides, as you already know (because you asked) &#8212; <em>I&#8217;m married</em>, so <em>I don&#8217;t know the last three transactions because I might not have made them!</em><br />
This is an open letter to BMO: Find a process that does not require someone to have up-to-the-moment financial history. It&#8217;s not feasible, and it&#8217;s (obviously) too difficult for some of us poor schmucks who are more worried about forgetting their wife&#8217;s birthday.</p>
