										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I arrived in Costa Rica on 16 June 2008. I started the process to become a resident of Costa Rica over a month before that. All of our paperwork was handled to immigration lawyers.<br />
And we waited.<br />
And waited.<br />
<span id="more-1925"></span>And waited.<br />
All of our documentation expired, and we had to obtain new versions of all of it. (Doing a police check when you no longer live in the city you last lived in? Not easy&#8230;)<br />
Then we waited some more.<br />
And waited.<br />
And waited.<br />
I have no idea why we waited so long. I&#8217;m sure, somewhere, there&#8217;s a reason for all of this waiting. I know we were waiting for certain other paperwork, but even that took an extraordinarily long time.<br />
But it&#8217;s mostly all worth it. Because now, after 487 days, I&#8217;m finally a legal temporary resident of Costa Rica.<br />
[flickr]photo:3874849425[/flickr]<br />
Okay, not entirely true. I was a legal resident about two months ago, after the initial government approval came through. It just took two more months to get the paperwork filed, visit the immigration offices, get yet more pictures taken, and then today get our official identification cards.<br />
Which makes me an official card-carrying temporary resident. Which is also kinda sad, as I was rather enjoying being an illegal alien. How many times in my life will I be able to say that?<br />
And yes, as you might expect, there&#8217;s a &#8220;but&#8221; coming. But that&#8217;s another blog post&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Julia is getting ready to have her Canadian Citizenship test, as she&#8217;s tired of being merely a Permanent Resident, and now apparently wants to have more say in these taxes she&#8217;s been paying.<br />
To that end, she&#8217;s received and is now reviewing the requisite materials for the test. (I offer you <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AdMNaHmNLgy9ZGRwYnBocTNfMzBjN3pmdmJjYw&amp;hl=en">the list of questions she gave to me</a>, unaltered, as a starting point.) As one might expect, the test has a number of questions that, yes, an average born-and-raised-in-Canada Canadian would flunk. (I would imagine the same is true of most countries.) Some of these are taken for granted, as just about everyone just accepts things as they are.<br />
But some of these questions are &#8230; well, let&#8217;s say that they just scream for alternative answers.<br />
<span id="more-1471"></span>I&#8217;m not going to put up every question because some of them are just darn obvious. Or otherwise boring, and have no particularly interesting answers. Again, if you want to see the original list, follow the above link. As for the answers, well, this is my take on them. So if you&#8217;re actually studying for the Canadian citizenship test, please, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">for the love of the maple leaf, read Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who are the Aboriginal peoples of Canada?<br />
Joe, Marge, Fred, Little Tom, Kinney, and Wilma.</li>
<li>Why are the Aboriginal peoples of Canada working toward self-government?<br />
If you&#8217;ve got the opportunity to not have to deal with the federal government, wouldn&#8217;t you?</li>
<li>Where did the first European settlers in Canada come from?<br />
Um&#8230; Europe?</li>
<li>Why did the early explorers first come to Atlantic Canada?<br />
Well, it was pretty bloody hard to go to Pacific Canada,   wasn&#8217;t it?</li>
<li>What three industries helped the early settlers build communities in the Atlantic region?<br />
Wal-Mart, McDonald&#8217;s, and Tim Horton&#8217;s.</li>
<li>Who were the United Empire Loyalists?<br />
A British football team.</li>
<li>What form of transportation did Aboriginal peoples and fur traders use to create trading networks in North America?<br />
<a href="http://www.ski-doo.com/">The ski-doo.</a></li>
<li>What important trade did the Hudsonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Bay Company control?<br />
Hockey cards.</li>
<li>What did the government do to make immigration to western Canada much easier?<br />
Made living in eastern Canada so unbearable that everyone fled west.</li>
<li>What is the Canadian Constitution?<br />
A piece of paper.</li>
<li>Which was the last province to join Canada?<br />
Newfoundland. (And while this is the truthful answer, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.newfiejokes.net/">newfie joke</a> all onto its own.)</li>
<li>Name two fundamental freedoms protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<br />
The right to bitch about the government and the right to apologise to anyone for no particular reason.</li>
<li>List three ways in which you can protect the environment.<br />
Again, a bit of a serious response &#8212; &#8216;cuz, yes, this is an actual question. I think it&#8217;s actually a survey question, because the federal government in Canada clearly doesn&#8217;t know how to do this themselves.</li>
<li>What are the two official languages of Canada?<br />
English, and French spoken really poorly by English-speakers.</li>
<li>What does the Canadian flag look like?<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=canadian+flag+joke">Must. Hold. Back. Obvious. Joke.</a></li>
<li>What song is Canadaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s national anthem?<br />
Duh! The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByKu8BwT5K4">theme to Hockey Night In Canada</a>!</li>
<li>Which animal is an official symbol of Canada?<br />
Okay, another serious one. The beaver. Seriously. How can you not love a country where it&#8217;s national symbol is the <em>beaver</em>. Ahem.</li>
<li>Where are the Great Lakes?<br />
Probably where you last left them.</li>
<li>Which country borders Canada on the south?<br />
Um. China? (Is this to trip up Americans applying for citizenship?)</li>
<li>What are the three main types of industries in Canada?<br />
Beer, hockey, and donuts.</li>
<li>In what industry do most Canadians work?<br />
Based on the NHL players, it&#8217;s definitely ice-related.</li>
<li>What is Canadaâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s system of government called?<br />
According to my dad, it&#8217;s &#8220;A Fucking Mess&#8221;.</li>
<li>What are the three parts of Parliament?<br />
&#8220;Goofy&#8221;, &#8220;Dopey&#8221;, and &#8220;Sleepy&#8221; come to mind&#8230; (On a serious note: Hey Canucks, did you know there were <em>three</em>?)</li>
<li>Explain how the levels of government are different.<br />
Well, all they tend not to do much. After that, it&#8217;s kinda dicey&#8230;</li>
<li>What do you call a law before it is passed?<br />
A joke.</li>
<li>How are members of Parliament chosen?<br />
Usually it&#8217;s the only person left after everyone else says: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna do it!&#8221;</li>
<li>Who do members of Parliament represent?<br />
Cynical answer: Themselves.</li>
<li>What is the government of all of Canada called?<br />
See #22.</li>
<li>How many electoral districts are there in Canada?<br />
Again, kinda serious&#8230; Are you fucking kidding me? Even the CBC doesn&#8217;t know this and has to look it up. I just laughed when I first heard this. Seriously? You want me to know this?</li>
<li>What three requirements must you meet in order to vote in a federal election?<br />
a) Be alive, b) not be totally drunk, and c) be ready to start bitching about the changes</li>
<li>What is written on a federal election ballot?<br />
Kinda like the electoral districts question, I was surprised by this one. I honestly have no idea, beyond the list of names of the people I&#8217;m supposed to choose from. Which, when you think about it, ain&#8217;t a lot of information to go on.<br />
Man, elections are kinda dumb.</li>
<li>What do political parties do?<br />
Again, I think this is a survey, because the government must be looking for suggestions on this one.</li>
<li>Which federal political party is in power?<br />
Funny, but somewhat true &#8212; right now, none. Minority governments mean no power. All of it is pure bargaining.</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, those are my (somewhat) interesting responses. I know there are lots more, though. Anyone else care to add a few?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so a while back I was having kittens (pun intended) about bringing Asia into Costa Rica. Mostly because I simply could not seem to get a straight answer from anyone about the proper process. <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/06/bringing-my-cat-into-costa-rica/">It was driving me batty.</a><br />
So, to anyone bringing in their (small) dog or cat (this might also work for rabbits, but don&#8217;t expect success with gerbils or hamsters or any form of rodent; and it&#8217;s a one-way trip for all birds, you can&#8217;t take them out again) into Costa Rica, allow me to present the (current) process. It&#8217;s really easy.<br />
<span id="more-1005"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Check with your government&#8217;s agricultural agency (the Ministry of Agriculture in Canada, for example) and find the International Health Certificate. (There is an American equivalent from the Department of Agriculture, but I&#8217;m not sure what it&#8217;s called.) Print it out.</li>
<li>Go to your vet, and ensure that your cat/dog has all their most recent vaccinations. Get documentation about all of it. It&#8217;s important, you&#8217;ll need it when you arrive. You&#8217;ll also need the vet to fill out the specifics of the aforementioned International Health Certificate, which they also need to sign.</li>
<li>In Canada (I can&#8217;t say for certain with the United States), you&#8217;ll need to schedule an appointment with the Ministry of Agriculture to have them sign the document as well, and stamp it to make it official. This is necessary &#8212; without this form, your pet will not be joining you.</li>
<li>Bring the pet with you on the plane in a carrier that fits under the seat. Not all airlines will do this anymore &#8212; Continental Airlines still does. Air Canada does not. This way, you can be assured that the pet is with you when you arrive, and does not go automatically into quarantine.</li>
<li>When you arrive in customs, you need to go to the Agricultura desk (it&#8217;s easy to see) and have them look over the papers. Provided you are not bringing the animal in for resale (e.g. it&#8217;s not merchandise), it&#8217;s a quick stamp, a scribble in the register, and you&#8217;re free to go &#8212; no duty required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your pet does not fit under the seat and/or must travel cargo (with you on the same flight), the process might be the same, provided you can collect your pet with your luggage. I&#8217;m not sure, as I didn&#8217;t see any other pets there.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re bringing in animals for resale, expect to pay a duty.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re bringing Asia with us. Not the continent; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2142575972/in/set-72157603438169851/">she&#8217;s our cat</a>. We don&#8217;t want to part with her. She&#8217;s a wonderful pet and truly part of the family. She was our first baby before Mi Niña Pequeña came along. Giving her up is just not an option.<br />
Getting her through the border is the trouble. Mostly because there is no de facto source of information on how this is done properly. What I have found is confusing and very contradictory. For someone who is going to be spending 12 hours with an annoyed kitteh (LOLCat spelling) &#8212; she might be stuck in that cage the entire time &#8212; I need to know that getting into the country isn&#8217;t going to kill her.<br />
Or me.<br />
<span id="more-982"></span>On <a href="http://www.sailcharbonneau.com/Sailing%20With%20Pets/QuarantineImport.htm">three</a> <a href="http://www.costarica.com/Trip-Planning/Travelers-Info/Pets%10Animals/">separate</a> <a href="http://www.costarica.com/Blog/2006_09_01_archive.html">pages</a>, I found that it really boils down to needing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pet health certificate (that includes the original rabies vaccination document) provided by my vet, and signed by (in Canada, anyway) the Ministry of Agriculture.</li>
<li>A personal letter stating the value of my cat. (Highly debatable, since Asia was a stray, and her &#8220;value&#8221; was the adoption fee.) I think this is mostly if you went out of country to buy a pet, then came back in.</li>
<li>Proof of payment of the Pet Customs Duty. This is related to the previous item (I think), and is not always applicable.</li>
<li>A Pet Quarantine Permit issued by the Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganaderia (Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Control).</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is the catch. Apparently, you can&#8217;t get that unless you&#8217;re in Costa Rica. But you need the papers from your vet to get the permit. And you can&#8217;t get the pet through the border without the permit. Seems very chicken-and-egg in nature (segue: &#8220;chicken and egg&#8221; is a bad metaphor; the egg came first, long before the chicken evolved).<br />
Colour me worried.<br />
So I did more digging, including calling Javier in Costa Rica to ask him. I figured he&#8217;d gone through this with the three gorgeous dogs that he has. Turns out, I was right, but he did it differently, where he shipped the dog in. And the above applies. He had a friend, however, who flew back with a puppy.<br />
Turns out that if you fly with your pet, all you should really need is the documentation from your vet, and signed by the appropriate animal control authority (the Ministry of Agriculture, in my case). Within 10 days of travelling, of course.<br />
All I have to do now is figure out if I can actually get down there with Asia on-board. I suppose in the worst-case scenario, she ends up in a quarantine for a little while. I would really hope to avoid that, though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was a day of lasts.<br />
The last train (finally, even if it was just an airport tram; I was thwarted from taking the airport express train by a completely bulletproof argument put forth by Amy that the bus was faster).<br />
The last flight.<br />
The last airport.<br />
The last country.<br />
<span id="more-585"></span>We left through Kansai Airport (the sinking island &#8212; I wonder if it still is sinking?), not nearly as impressive as I&#8217;d hoped it would be. Chek Lap Kok is much nicer, I think. Amy flew in Business, with me back in Galley Slave. The food was horrific on a level I can&#8217;t even begin to describe.<br />
San Francisco was a rush of English. Ouch. But nothing was more painful than trying to get through United States Immigration.<br />
Okay, rant&#8230;<br />
We&#8217;ve been to a number of countries, now. Why is it that, even with countries that need a visa to enter, getting in and out is generally trivial? Amy&#8217;s got an American passport, I&#8217;ve got a Canadian one. Not a single issue. Ever.<br />
Except in the United States. Amy gets to go through the Resident line. Quick, effective. Me? &#8220;Visitor&#8221;. Never mind the fact that Canadians are effectively treated like Americans, especially when in transit through the United States to home, and especially when not there on business. I was one of only two Canucks in the line of about 300. The rest were mostly Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino, with a couple of Aussies thrown in for good measure. Time for me to get through? An <strong>hour</strong>.<br />
Really, does the United States need to be this paranoid? Fair enough, there&#8217;s been a terrorist attack. Do you really think that anyone determined enough is going to let you inspect them at the border? Scans of index fingers and digital photographs probably aren&#8217;t going to do anything useful, except make people wonder why they&#8217;re being treated like criminals. As a Canadian, I&#8217;ve been lucky to avoid that crap, but I&#8217;m waiting for the day we have to do that, too. Grr.<br />
The delays meant no early flight home. So we spent a few hours wandering around San Francisco. Probably the smartest thing to do, since we needed the time to realize that yes, Toto, we are back in Kansas. It&#8217;s weird having to relearn to listen and read a language you&#8217;ve known your entire life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attention Lonely Planet! You might want to update your information for the next run of your Trans Siberian Railway book, &#8216;cuz a few things have changed.<br />
According to Lonely Planet, the crossing from Mongolia to China takes about seven hours, during which time you can get off, change money, eat at the restaurant, and so on. However, they seem to be only covering the case that you&#8217;re crossing the border during the day. If you take train #24 from Ulaan Baatar to Beijing, things are a little different&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-551"></span>So you&#8217;ve survived the journey across the Gobi desert. It&#8217;s desolate. It&#8217;s not exactly the most interesting thing to see. Even three days of birch trees was better. You arrive at Zamin Uud, the border city in Mongolia. You&#8217;re about two hours late due to various delays along the line getting there. (Unlike Russia, Mongolia has only a single track through most of its area, and exceedingly few sidings with which to stagger train movements.) Due to late arrival, the exit process runs a bit quicker than the book suggests.<br />
Although there is still the mandatory banging around of cars as the train is arranged for shuttling to Erlian, the Chinese border city. By the time you finally cross the invisible line, it&#8217;s dark. You can&#8217;t even see it. Arriving in Erlian, things happen pretty quickly, again. You&#8217;re still a bit behind schedule, but the shortened process in Mongolia has made up for a large portion of that time. The immigration officers come in, do their thing (one form in triplicate, two others are one-offs), and you&#8217;re tickety-boo.<br />
Almost.<br />
One problem remains (here&#8217;s where the train stuff comes in): the train you&#8217;re on can&#8217;t run in China. Russia, for some odd reason, has a wider track gauge than pretty much everyone else (not counting narrow-gauge railways, that is) &#8212; including China. However, someone planned for this, and the process to adapt the train is fairly simple, if esoteric.<br />
Instead of letting everyone off the train (which is what is supposed to happen &#8212; note to Lonely Planet), the entire train is backed up to a large building about a half kilometre from the station house. The building is itself about 400 metres long and at least 10 metres high (there&#8217;s a large overhead crane in there, though it wasn&#8217;t in use). The cars are divided and set next to tough-looking yellow devices firmly implanted in the thick concrete floor, four per car, one at each corner (about a metre in, actually).<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03618.JPG" alt="Jacks used to lift cars to change bogies" width="300" /></a><br />
The car bodies are then jacked up off of the bogies that connect them to the track. (If you&#8217;re not sure what a bogie is, look at a rail car &#8212; the bogie is the part with the wheels and the bracket that holds them in place.) The wide bogies are then pushed out in favour of narrower ones. The car bodies are then lowered back down, and you&#8217;re good to go. The process took about an hour and a half, all told, for the 10 or so cars that had to go through the process.<br />
According to Lonely Planet, you&#8217;re supposed to be allowed to get off and watch. We had to setting to view through dirty windows. Only when the train was reformed and brought back to the station were people finally let off &#8212; 100 yard dashers don&#8217;t run that fast.<br />
Without question the coolest thing, albeit weirdest thing, I&#8217;ve seen done to trains yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We knew this was going to be rough. We knew this was going to be long. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as we thought it might be, but it was still <strong>long</strong>.<br />
We took Train 364 (formerly 264) from Ulan Ude to Ulaan Baatar. (The train itself runs Irkutsk to UB.) As we would find out, the whole train doesn&#8217;t go to Mongolia &#8212; only the cars that contain passengers going to Mongolia. We found this out when we got to the Naushki station, on the Russian/Mongolian border.<br />
<span id="more-548"></span>The Russians started shunting our car around. I think this was mostly to kill time. Why else would they continually back up, go forward, back up, go forward, and so forth for about an <em>hour</em>? Incidentally, Russian cars (as Amy and I decided) are not built for the harsh conditions of operation in Russia. They&#8217;re built to withstand the abuse from the engineers. I thought they were going to shake the whole car apart!<br />
We finally ended up, alone, completely separate from the rest of the train:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03590.JPG" alt="All alone, sitting out in the open" width="300" /></a><br />
As we would also decide later, this was because our car was the only one going to Mongolia. The other cars were part of the train that terminated at Naushki, and would return to Irkutsk with new passengers.<br />
And so began our wait. And wait we did. It would be a few hours before we saw anyone official-like board our train. At first, it was just someone to check our passports and make sure they were in order. That was a quick check. It was easily two more hours past that before the real officials came out. (When they did, soliders closed down the platform &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t go out there until you were supposed to be out there.) While we waited, we amused ourselves by watching a pile driver:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03591.JPG" alt="How do these things work, anyway?" width="300" /></a><br />
Yes, we were that bored.<br />
With the final forms filled out (the exit customs form) and our passports, stamped, we resumed our waiting.<br />
Six hours after we got there, we finally left, a single car towed by a lonely diesel locomotive out to Sukhbaatar, 21 kilometres inside the Mongolian border.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03592.JPG" alt="The station at Sukhbaatar" width="300" /></a><br />
To wait some more.<br />
After a couple of hours, the Mongolians started to let us in. This involved three forms (entry/exit form, health form, and customs form). After the health form was signed, we got scammed into US$10 health insurance. I&#8217;ve heard this is bogus, but we were too tired to care at that point. In between the official stamping of passports, we received a barrage of people who wanted to exchange our rubles for togrogs &#8212; which we&#8217;d already done in Naushki. They kept at is, the same people asking many times, despite us saying (more and more loudly every time) that we have none!<br />
Finally, passports stamped (using their hands as the table for stamping, despite one being in the cabin), we finally left Sukhbaatar for Ulaan Baatar.<br />
Total crossing time: 10 hours. Ish.<br />
Luckily, mostly done during the day. The other way, I gather it&#8217;s mostly at night. Ugh!</p>
