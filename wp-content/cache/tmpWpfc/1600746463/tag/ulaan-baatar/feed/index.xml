								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I rarely remember my dreams. I have to wake up in the middle of them to remember what they were about, and quite often I&#8217;m so tired that by the time I can get my mental faculties together to try and remember the dream, I already forgot what it was. Which is probably good, since most of the dreams I remember make very little sense.<br />
This morning&#8217;s dream was an exception. I was talking with someone I know (admittedly, can&#8217;t remember who it was) about trains. (Believe it or not, this is not an unknown conversation.) They asked me what my favourite train trips were, and I had said something like &#8220;whoa, that&#8217;s a tough one, let me think&#8221;. Then I started rhyming them off.<br />
Oddly enough, that was about when I woke up &#8230; and I kept rhyming. So I figured, heck, that just sounds like a blog post!<br />
<span id="more-2234"></span>Now these are in rough order of enjoyability and preference (if I had the opportunity to ride again). Though I should state that I would probably ride any of these again in a heartbeat, anyway. Some of these no longer run, however, so their appearance here is strictly archival.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>VIA Rail Canadian Vancouver &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a> charter, not currently possible under regular scheduling)<br />
This will likely forever remain my favourite. I had the chance at a unique contract with the CBC, which ended up running <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/photos/cbc-television-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">coast-to-coast across Canada on a VIA Rail train</a> made entirely of the 1940s Pullman stainless steel cars. There is just no better way to see Canada.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/trans-siberian-railway/"><strong>Trans-Siberian Railway</strong></a><strong> Moscow &#8211; Irkutsk</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
It&#8217;s hard to imagine that you can spend 5 days on a constantly-moving train running across a single country, and see almost nothing but vast openness and endless tracts of birch trees. There&#8217;s something magic, mystical, even mysterious about the journey.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/crossing-the-mongolia-china-border-by-train/"><strong>Trans-Mongolian Railway Ulaan Baatar &#8211; Bejing</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.mtz.mn/">Mongolyn TÃ¶mÃ¶r Zam</a>, <a href="http://www.china-mor.gov.cn/">China Railways</a>)<br />
The trip from Russia to Ulaan Baatar is okay. But the trip from Ulaan Bataar to Bejing is something else. First, the intense desolation of the Gobi Desert. Next, a rail gauge change in Inner Mongolia, followed by an overnight trip into the heart of China, passing through the Great Wall itself as you descend via switchback before finally arriving in Beijing. It&#8217;s a helluva trip.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/06/the-shanghai-maglev-train/"><strong>Shanghai MagLev</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en/">Shanghai MagLev Transportation Development Corp.</a>)<br />
Pure. Blinding. Speed. This train doesn&#8217;t go far &#8212; from the Pudong area near central Shanghai out to Pudong International Airport, the trip is a mere 30 km. But it travels the distance in just over seven minutes at speeds of up to 431 km/h.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/08/bc-rail-cariboo-prospector/"><strong>The Cariboo Prospector</strong></a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
Before BC Rail was bought by CN, they ran a passenger service between Prince George and Vancouver. It was an all-day trip, leaving early in the morning, and arriving well after dinner. But there was never a more fantastic trip through the Fraser Canyon, with more spectacular views of places you can&#8217;t get to by car. The service, sadly, no longer runs on BC Rail. <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com/routes_and_packages/rainforest_to_gold_rush">A similar trip is available through the Rocky Mountaineer.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2002/10/via-rail-bras-dor-halifax-sydney/"><strong>The Bras D&#8217;or Halifax &#8211; Sydney</strong></a><strong> &#8211; Halifax</strong> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>, discontinued)<br />
VIA Rail ran a slightly odd service (meant to promote tourism, but allowed for no stopover time) between Halifax, Nova Scotia and Sydney, Cape Breton. The trip ran along the shores of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, and in the fall ranks as one of the most beautiful trips I&#8217;ve seen. (The fact that I also got to ride in the cab just made it that much better.) Sadly, due to line maintenance issues, VIA Rail no longer runs this service.</li>
<li><strong>Nozomi Shinkansen </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_Main_Line"><strong>Tokaido Line, Tokyo &#8211; Osaka</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/global.html">JR West</a>)<br />
The famous Bullet Train. This is the longest line, running from capital Tokyo to Osaka. The Nozomi-class trains have the fewest stops, hence run the fastest along the line, too.   <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/shinkansen/">Riding a Shinkansen is an experience</a>, not just from the scenery, but from watching the sheer efficiency and pride in which the Japanese operate the service. Even riding in standard class makes you feel important.</li>
<li><a href="http://rrsites.com/royalhudson/"><strong>Royal Hudson</strong></a><strong> Vancouver &#8211; Squamish &#8211; Vancouver</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_Rail">BC Rail</a>, no longer in scheduled operation)<br />
Before BC Rail had to take Hudson <a href="http://www.wcra.org/hudson/story.htm">CP 2860</a> out of service (in need of a refit), I was fortunate enough to ride the train from Vancouver to Squamish and back. (And visited the <a href="http://wcra.org">West Coast Railway Association</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.wcra.org/heritage/">Railway Heritage Park</a> while I was at it.) The line running up the coast is full of wonderful twists and curves, and the view is fantastic. CP 2860 is now leased to the WCRA, who will hopefully run this service periodically with flair.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.absteamtrain.com/"><strong>Alberta Prairie Steam Tours</strong></a><strong> w/ </strong><a href="http://6060.org"><strong>CN 6060</strong></a> (APST, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2001/08/steam-frain-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/">I got to ride in the caboose</a>, which regular folks don&#8217;t)<br />
Although it&#8217;s been a long time since I last helped out, I used to <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/tag/cn-6060/">work on CN 6060 as an apprentice mechanic</a>. After one such helping-out, I was offered a trip on its scheduled run &#8212; a mere 35 mile run to Big Valley and back. But I got to ride with my mentor, Don, in the caboose. Right next to CN 6060 on the way down, but at the end of the train on the way back. Very memorable, especially considering that I rode on a train pulled by CN 6060 when I was a young boy.</li>
<li><strong>Inverness &#8211; Edinburgh</strong> (<a href="http://www.scotrail.co.uk/">First ScotRail</a>)<br />
This is a regularly-schedule service (multiple times a day, no less) between two of the three largest cities in Scotland. This service &#8212; a five-hour jaunt &#8212; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/2426316987/in/set-72157604778761863/">runs through the Scottish highlands</a> (you&#8217;ll see snow on those rolling mountains), through small villages, and across fantastic landscapes before coming down to the sea, and finally crossing the massive Fourth Bridge. Inverness itself is an excellent place to visit (very near Loch Ness!), and Edinburgh remains one of my favourite cities. It&#8217;s worth the trip, especially if you have a rail pass.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrow_(Russian_train)"><strong>Krazny Strelya (&#8220;Red Arrow&#8221;)</strong></a><strong> St. Petersburg &#8211; Moscow</strong> (<a href="http://www.eng.rzd.ru/">Rossiyskie Zheleznye Dorogi</a>)<br />
Curiously, I didn&#8217;t actually see much of this train. It was <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/russian-trains/">an overnight journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow</a>. But I do remember it being an extremely nice train (apparently one of the two nicest on Russian railways), and it was the start of my St. Petersburg to Hong Kong overland odyssey. So it has a special place in my memory.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.viarail.ca/en/trains/ontario-and-quebec/toronto-montreal"><strong>Montreal &#8211; Toronto</strong></a> (<a href="http://viarail.ca">VIA Rail</a>)<br />
This might sound extremely pedestrian, but I like this train. It&#8217;s a regular service (several times daily) that runs between two of Canada&#8217;s largest cities. It&#8217;s a 5-6 hour trip, which you can do faster if you fly. But you can&#8217;t do it more comfortably. And you don&#8217;t get to see the landscape that is the St. Lawrence Seaway region. It&#8217;s some of Canada&#8217;s oldest rail, and still some of the nicest.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the notable ones. There&#8217;s a host of other trains as well, such as commuter lines (GO Train, West Coast Express, BART, AMT, to name a few), local trains (such as most of Japan Rail, China&#8217;s Z1 line between Beijing and Tianjin, and certainly with the regional UK trains), and long distance trains within China, and the London &#8211; Glasgow/Edinburgh lines in the UK.<br />
Since that covers most of my train-riding experiences, yes, you can assume that I generally quite line trains.<br />
Are there ones I don&#8217;t like? Well, the one that comes most to mind is the section of the <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2005/05/the-last-russian-stop/">Trans-Siberian between Urkutsk and Ulan Ude</a>. That is pretty darn lousy&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re back in Ulaan Baatar after a few days out in the Mongolian wilderness. It&#8217;s a brief return &#8212; we hit the #24 train to Beijing at 8:00 tomorrow morning. (It&#8217;s about 21:30 right now, as I&#8217;m writing this.)<br />
Without question, Mongolia has been the highlight of this adventure. Unless something really spectacular comes up that somehow manages to sway us (which I doubt will happen), then Mongolia will be <em>the</em> thing on the trip. Also without question, we would heartily recommend coming to Mongolia (and soon, before the rest of the world discovers how cool this country is) and signing up with Nomadic Journeys. They take far too good care of you.<br />
<span id="more-550"></span>Our campsite was about 300 km west of Ulaan Baatar &#8212; a trip that takes six hours. Most of the roads in Mongolia were built back in the 1950s by the Russians and Chinese &#8230; and haven&#8217;t really received any major attention since then. Needless to say, if you&#8217;re not driving something well-built, you don&#8217;t be driving it too long &#8212; the roads will turn them to pulp. We drove in a small Russian-built jeep without seatbelts. Our driver, Lasaa (assuming I&#8217;m spelling his name correctly) is an expert driver, and avoided the majority of the disasters of the road. That meant driving all over the road, including the shoulders.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03595.JPG" alt="The scenery as you drive in Mongolia" width="300" /></a><br />
It&#8217;s an interesting commentary when the dirt roads that sometimes parallel the highway are better than the highway.<br />
When we arrived at our camp (which appeared rather suddenly), we found three gers, tents used by the Mongolian nomadic people. They&#8217;re wood-framed, built in a circle with a sloped conical roof. The entire frame is covered with felt and canvas. They&#8217;re ridiculously comfy, even in the heat we experienced. Amy and I were the only tourists there &#8212; we&#8217;re the first of the season at that location. There were two nomadic families across the valley.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03596.JPG" alt="Our ger camp" width="300" /></a><br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03597.JPG" alt="Just to prove I was there" width="300" /></a><br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03598.JPG" alt="The all-important toilet; which, thankfully, did not stink" width="300" /></a><br />
The first day there was a laid-back one: hiking up the adjacent mountain (Amy to half-way; I couldn&#8217;t resist the surge to the top). Meals were in the middle ger. The second day took us on a hike north through the valley, passing a family of domesticated camels, and through a mountain pass to a small Buddhist temple on the other side (Lasa met us there to drive us back). The temple has but a single nun (not even a monk, so far as we could tell) and a museum curator, who showed us around. There&#8217;s ruins there from a previous building destroyed when the Soviets ran amok through Mongolia in an attempt to stamp out all religion.<br />
To give you an idea of how unspoiled this place is, when we wandered around the ruins, we found fragments of Buddha statues and artwork still in the dirt. That&#8217;s how few tourists have been here. (Even though there is a &#8220;card shop&#8221;.)<br />
After lunch, we visited a small lake featuring kites, ducks (that sounded like frogs), and horses. Beautiful scenery, too. Then it was a visit over to one of the nomadic families to see how they live. Truth be known, they live pretty well. The gers are so comfortable, most nomadic families choose to live in them instead of permanent shelters. It&#8217;s also necessary as many families have to move (up to four times a year) to keep their herds of animals fed and watered. We petted baby sheep and goats. One tried to milk me by banging it head repeatedly into my groin. I mean, honestly, do I look like a goat?? After dinner, Amy and I dragged Ganaa (our guide/translator) up the side of a sand dune to watch a sunset. We were treated to a rather strange spectacle when we returned as the nomadic family tried to get their herd into a small corral for milking time.<br />

<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03607.JPG" alt="Not nearly as noisy as you think it should have been" width="300" /></a><br />
Our third day marked a trip to Kharakorum and Erdene Zuu, the former being the ancient capital of Mongolia, and the latter being the monastery that still operates there. Three hours on bumpy roads. Beatiful buildings, though. Amazing part of it was that we were among the first tourists there that day &#8212; most of those in attendance were there for the ceremony marking the first 15 days of summer, which was the monks chanting the entire day. The fact we could walk around the museum temples unimpeded by a single tourist was &#8230; very zen.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03608.JPG" alt="The temples of Erdene Zuu" width="300" /></a><br />
The weather on the morning of our fourth day was unbelievable. The wind that had started the night before had given rise to rain, blowing sand (you couldn&#8217;t see the dunes &#8212; a mere kilometre away &#8212; for the clouds erupting from them), and eventually snow as we rolled to Hustai National Park, 95 km from Ulaan Baatar.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03610.JPG" alt="Crappy weather on the road" width="300" /></a><br />
Hustai is a preserve that hosts the only wild population of tahki &#8212; the Mongolian wild horse. It was reintroduced here in the early 1990s, and has grown to over 200 horses in 14 small herds. (That, and an insane number of marmots.) It was freezing as we got our glances at a distance, but they were neat to see. We stayed in Ger #7 at the Hustai Tourist &#8220;Resort&#8221;. (About 20 gers, a couple of permanent buildings, and a &#8220;restaurant&#8221; serving food so lacking in flavour, I&#8217;d describe it as a gastronomic vacuum.)<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03611.JPG" alt="The ger camp at Hustai National Park in Mongolia" width="300" /></a><br />
I woke up about 3:00 this morning in a big shivering ball. Our fire had gone out and the temperatures had plunged. Needless to say, I&#8217;m a little tired as a result. Even once I was more bundled up (and I was beginning to think that long underwear wasn&#8217;t a good idea to bring!), my brain ran crazy with ways of trying to rekindle our dead fire. Note to self: always bring matches in the future when going to places that need fires.<br />
We returned to UB today and made a beeline for the Gobi Factory Store. Gobi is the major manufacturer of cashmere goods, at least in Mongolia. I knew of them before coming, but hadn&#8217;t really thought that this was the place. It really was a factory store, too &#8212; the store was attached to the Gobi factory. Prices were decent, although the place was mobbed by some very unruly and rude French tourists.<br />
The real prize, however, was not the completed fabrics. It was cashmere yarn, which Gobi does <strong>not</strong> sell in their stores. And Amy could not leave Mongolia without it. To get it, Ganaa went through the most amazing display of digging that I&#8217;ve ever seen. It took 90 minutes, including walking deep into the Gobi factory to find the yarn storage room to select the spools, but we walked away with 2.3 kilos of it. Amy&#8217;s happy, to say the least. But I&#8217;ll leave that portion of the story to her. It&#8217;s a doozy.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03614.JPG" alt="Cashmere yarn at the Gobi Factory in Ulaan Baatar" width="300" /></a><br />
After that, we visited the Bogd Khaan&#8217;s Summer Palace in the south part of the city. It&#8217;s nice, but poorly maintained. Some of the treasures inside are wonderful, but it wasn&#8217;t worth the 5500T it cost for me to take pictures (even though that&#8217;s only about US$5). After Erdene Zuu, it was hard to look at the Summer Palace and think it was wonderful.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03615.JPG" alt="The gates of the Bogd Khan's Summer Palace" width="300" /></a><br />
And so we leave Mongolia for China. Our plans have changed a bit, there. We&#8217;re hitting only Beijing, Xi&#8217;an, and Guangzhou (only because it&#8217;s right next to Hong Kong, and after the train from Xi&#8217;an, we won&#8217;t be up to crossing the border right away). Then it&#8217;s into the Hong Kong area, first with Macau, then HK proper. Why the cutting back? Too much running in and out of places has made us weary, and after hearing a few too many horror stories, we&#8217;re not sure that we&#8217;re even going to like China that much. But we shall see&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We arrived early this morning. We were up by 5:00, but only arrived an hour later or so. After a sort-of-nap (couldn&#8217;t sleep), we were picked up by our guide (again; she&#8217;d also taken us to the hotel from the station) and shown around the city.<br />
First up was Sukhbaatar Square &#8212; a large open area in front of the Mongolian Parliment. It&#8217;s sort of like Red Square, but is named after a man who is credited with being the hero of Mongolia, who led the armies who finally pushed China out of &#8220;outer Mongolia&#8221; and declared an independant Mongolia. He died mysteriously (insert obligatory conspiracy theory here) and is buried at the north end of the square in a mausoleum. Unlike Lenin and Mao, however, you can&#8217;t get in to see him.<br />

Then it was over to the Gandantegchinlen Monastery, the largest in Mongolia and also the main one. It&#8217;s relatively old, though a lot of it (like most of the monasteries in Mongolia) were ransacked by the Soviets under the guise of socialism. There&#8217;s an 80-metre statue in the largest building in the complex to replace the one the Soviets stole and melted down into bullets.<br />

Then it was off for a cultural presentation of song, dance, and music, including Mongolian throat singing. (I swear I sound like that some mornings!)<br />
Tomorrow, we&#8217;re off for the back country for some &#8220;camping&#8221; (ger camps, though we&#8217;re not sure what to expect). Needless to say, we won&#8217;t be posting for a few days &#8212; I doubt there&#8217;s internet way out there.</p>
