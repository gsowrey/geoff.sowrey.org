										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until today &#8212; 12:42 MT, to be exact &#8212; I had a <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2007/09/apple-doesnt-hate-canada-rogers-bell-and-telus-do/">particularly negative view of the Canadian mobile market</a>. Generally, I expected the Big 3 telcos to basically keep screwing over us little folk, and continue to treat Canada as a lovely little cash cow where there&#8217;s no competition.<br />
Anyone who&#8217;s on Telus, pay attention! The game has changed.<br />
<span id="more-886"></span>Over the Christmas break, my friend (and co-worker) Marcie bought a Blackberry Pearl. I&#8217;d originally wanted a Pearl &#8212; it&#8217;s smaller, and it has a digital camera. But Telus didn&#8217;t offer it (at the time), so I went with a Blackberry 8830 World Edition. For the record, I&#8217;m not complaining &#8212; the lack of a camera isn&#8217;t the end of the world for me. [[I&#8217;m on crack|And I love being on crack.]]<br />
But what I didn&#8217;t like was the data rates.<br />
I was paying $25/month to get 4 MB of data. Four megs. Paltry. I go through that with one breath. I&#8217;m a data whore, I admit it. Give me data or give me death. It drives Alex crazy that I spend as much time as I do on computers. But I love the connectivity. It&#8217;s what I do. It&#8217;s what I am.<br />
Marcie told me that she signed onto an unlimited data plan. I scoffed &#8212; no such thing in Canada! None of the carriers would be that nice, c&#8217;mon! She swore up and down the wall that it was legit. And she called Telus to prove it. She weren&#8217;t lyin&#8217;.<br />
So I called Telus. Mostly because, as a nigh-on-eight years loyal customer, I want unlimited data! Sure enough, the plan is legit.<br />
The details:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to have at least a $30/month plan. (Hey, Telus might be willing to change the game, but they&#8217;re not stupid.)</li>
<li>The contract applies for all text, email, and non-tethered browsing.</li>
<li>It doesn&#8217;t cover access outside of Canada.</li>
<li>You connect your phone to your computer, you&#8217;re back to paying high rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Sign me up!&#8221; I cried in delight. I had to up my plan (previously on Talk 25, I&#8217;m now on the Favs plan), but in the end &#8212; get this &#8212; I&#8217;m saving $15/month in fees, and that&#8217;s not even covering the overages I was heading for (I was already double my limit, and I was trying to play it safe).<br />
Thank you, Telus. You&#8217;ve partially restored my faith in the fact that maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; the Canadian mobile market isn&#8217;t as screwed up as I thought it was.</p>

Yes, I&#8217;ve bought a Blackberry. A model 8830 to be specific. Alex is calling it my delayed father&#8217;s day present.<br />
I can live with that.<br />
No, it&#8217;s no iPhone, but it&#8217;s a pretty good solution. Better keyboard, too.<br />
Alex and I are currently sitting in the Devonian Gardens playing with our new phones (she got a Chocolate Flip).<br />
And yes, I posted this from the Crackberry!</p>
