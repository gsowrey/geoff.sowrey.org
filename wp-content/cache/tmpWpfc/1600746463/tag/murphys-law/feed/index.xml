								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, Murphy, I&#8217;m talking to you.  <br />
You&#8217;ve been dogging me now for 10 months, almost non-stop. You&#8217;ve always been there, hiding in the shadows, popping out every so often to cause a bit of havoc only to vanish again.  <br />
Damned if I know how you did it, but you hid in my luggage or stowed away in the stuff we shipped down from Canada, and moved into my closet. And you&#8217;ve been there ever since. You&#8217;ve come to the office with me every day, haunting my every action, standing over every project. And I&#8217;m sure our hellish daily commute is your doing.<br />
Then then you decided to screw around with my family&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-1284"></span>Oh, sure, at first it was just minor things: the broken window, the near-constant ant invasion, getting our internet cancelled the day after a bill is due, the yappy dogs downstairs, loosing Alex&#8217;s license in New York City, breaking the auto focus on my camera, cancelling our credit cards when we needed them, making Alex buy a useless plane ticket, and the oh-so-wonderfully timed cold that broke out just went we got to a beach.<br />
And that night of vomiting and  diarrhea? That was a nice touch. Thank you for that.  <br />
But I really have to wonder when you switched from being an irritant to an outright antagonistic bastard. Was it wholly necessary to keep me at work so long that I don&#8217;t see my family as much as I need to? And when we finally come to a nice, long weekend where I had the time to plan a nice trip for my family, you subject Alex (and likely the rest of us) to strep throat thus cancelling the trip?!<br />
Fuck you, Murphy. I&#8217;ve had it with your shit. I want you out of my closet, away from my family, away from my job. You are not funny, amusing, or even interesting anymore. You&#8217;re an ass. You&#8217;re a selfish worm who has no interest or care in anyone but your own self-importance.<br />
So leave now while you still can.</p>
