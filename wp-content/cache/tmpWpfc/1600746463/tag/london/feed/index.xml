										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;and I feel, well, okay. Maybe not necessarily &#8220;fine&#8221;.<br />
Critical Mass has done a bit of a reorganisation. I emphasise &#8220;a bit&#8221;. Mostly because this is not the radical shifts we&#8217;ve seen in the past. I think this is my third or fourth reorganisation since starting with Critical Mass back in 2000 (admittedly, I&#8217;m losing track), and this is the most minor change we&#8217;ve had.<br />
At least when you look at the big picture.<br />
<span id="more-971"></span>In short, no promotions, no demotions. Just changes in role and responsibility. Which, when you think about it, is the real purpose of a reorganisation: shuffle the existing chart to align with your needs. And our needs are global. We have production offices in Calgary, Chicago, Toronto, and London. Costa Rica starts up in 30 days.<br />
In our old system, it was becoming hard to handle all that. We had department VPs who had to spread their influence across many offices. Control was all centralised at Calgary, which while we thought it was good for ensuring standards and practises, tended to impose controls on the other offices, which was detrimental to their operation.<br />
So now we&#8217;ve got independent offices. Each have General Managers, four lead people from each of the former departments (Creative, Technology, Planning, and Operations), and their own controls. They still report to Critical Mass Global Operations (aka Head Office aka Calgary), but the influence of old is greatly lessened.<br />
We&#8217;ve effectively given them all much more rope, and more room for success. We&#8217;ve also likely created more competition. I just hope it remains the healthy kind.<br />
The trick out of all of this is that we don&#8217;t have our over-arching leadership at the department level. It&#8217;s going to be up to the office leads to ensure that communication remains. The last thing we need is to turn into our competition where the individual offices have no clue what the others are doing. It&#8217;s a lousy way to learn when you can&#8217;t/don&#8217;t talk to each other.<br />
There is one part in all of this I don&#8217;t like. Allard Losier, my 8-year leader, mentor, devil&#8217;s advocate, prank target, talk show host, Defender of the Right and Just, and friend is leaving. I can&#8217;t even begin to rhyme off the things I&#8217;ve learned from him over the years, and there&#8217;s no way to calculate the huge effect he&#8217;s had on my career development. An era officially comes to and end with his departure. To the few of us multi-year veterans still left in the (now former) Technology department, this is a hard loss. It also puts the onus on us to ensure that we live up to the expectations, to the things we still believe are right.<br />
We&#8217;re going to miss you Allard. Just so you know.<br />
It&#8217;s (a bit of) a new world. I&#8217;m going to be a part of it, even if at a distance. But I can say that if this goes the way I&#8217;m told it will go, we should see some new and exciting things come from Critical Mass in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the few minutes I have before I dive back into another conference session, figured I&#8217;d cover some of the items of our last vacation. This was a 2.5 week excursion mostly to Scotland, with a few days in England. Alex planned most of the trip, with me handling things like the transportation and hotels to stay along the way. Overall, about a 50/50 split on the events et al.<br />
Sadly, at the end, it wasn&#8217;t a usual vacation. Until now, it&#8217;s always been either just me, or myself and Alex. Now there&#8217;s three of us, and the Wee One doesn&#8217;t have our stamina for travel and has a pseudo-schedule that needs to be followed from time-to-time.<br />
<span id="more-928"></span></p>
<h4>British Airways</h4>
<p>We flew BA from Calgary to London (via Heathrow). Air Canada &#8212; are you listening? These are the guys you should be looking to for level of service. Wow. Allow me to describe: We arrive at the plane along the jetway, with stroller (and babe) in hand. They tell us that they might not be able to bring the stroller on-board, but they&#8217;d let us know. They didn&#8217;t ask for seat or name &#8212; they figured it out on their own, checked the stroller, and gave us the claim ticket. They presented us with a small toy bag for the Wee One with a small stuffed plane for playtime. Free wine. Good (read: real) food. A feeling like people actually cared about the passengers&#8217; well-being. Excellent in-flight entertainment for that 8-9 flight. Sure, it costs a bit extra. But not so much that I wouldn&#8217;t even think twice about flying with them again &#8212; that&#8217;s a definite.</p>
<h4>Travelling with the Wee One</h4>
<p>Most people thought we were nuts for hauling our offspring to Europe. A seven hour time difference, air travel, trains, ferries, lots of packing and moving, and add an infant to all of that?<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2007/11/24/we-have-a-travel-safe-baby/">I said it before</a>, but our kid rocks. Sleep on the flight out (sadly, not so much on the way back), adjustment to the timezone in two nights (by the third day, all was well), played a lot on the trains (although she did have trouble sleeping due to lack of space), and she didn&#8217;t keep us up at night even though we were all in the same room. It didn&#8217;t matter how many places we went or how many people wanted to hold her (the Wee One apparently is the cutest thing many Brits have ever seen, judging by the near-endless stream of comments we got).<br />
And hey, I got to spend 2.5 of constant time with my child! What on Earth could be wrong with that?<br />
About the only bad thing (if you could call it that) was one bad habit picked up by a three-week older infant, and now the raspberry has entered the vocabulary.</p>
<h4>Iona and the Iona Community</h4>
<p>This was our first stop. Iona is a small island off the coast of the Isle of Mull, which is in turn off the western coast of Scotland. (The nearest major port is Oban, in case you&#8217;re looking for a geographical reference.) The day we arrived, there was a viciously strong and cold north wind. We immediately regretted having arrived, but pressed on. The Community itself runs mostly out of the Iona Abbey, which is owned and operated by Historical Scotland. For a week, we were guests, and basically had free run of the place.<br />
That said, a week at a Christian commune (even an ecumenical one) takes a bit of a toll on the less- (or non-)devout. Although the people were wonderful &#8212; and I have to say that while I lamented the absence of meat in our meals, the things they can do with vegetables are stunning &#8212; I was happy to be on the road again for the mainland.<br />
It&#8217;s a very small island, so it&#8217;s (relatively) easy to get around on it. Though parts of it are very boggy, you can cross the island in about 30 minutes, and go the length in about three times that. Even the highest point on the island &#8212; Dun I &#8212; takes about 15 minutes to climb, if you take your time.<br />
It&#8217;s quiet, and it&#8217;s very dark at night &#8212; there are almost no street lights. It&#8217;s so quiet that doors mostly don&#8217;t have locks. The Abbey (technically-speaking) is open all the time.</p>
<h4>Oban</h4>
<p>I heard a few people trash Oban before I went there. But I have to say it&#8217;s a nice little town. It&#8217;s a good base for day trips, and there&#8217;s a lot to see in the area. You could easily stay there a week and not be bored. Given, the hotel we stayed at (Oban Caledonian) had some trouble &#8212; when you have to name the springs in your mattress due to the intimacy you&#8217;re getting with them, it&#8217;s time to replace the mattress. But I&#8217;ve stayed in far, far worse for much more money.</p>
<h4>Train Travel</h4>
<p>I love trains. Duh. You know that. So travelling all over the place on trains is generally not a problem. But I gotta say, someone has to change the rules that puts an end to the drunken football hooligans from spreading out all over the car, singing their songs and disturbing the crap out of everyone else, stinking the place up with their booze, and generally being belligerent. No, asshole, I&#8217;m not student. Unlike you, I have the good sense to travel responsibly, but there&#8217;s not enough luggage racks in the car for my backpack. That doesn&#8217;t give you the right to use it as a pillow or a reason to tell me off. (I also have the good sense to not say anything, since I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re looking for a reason to get into a fight.)</p>
<h4>Inverness</h4>
<p>I also had people tell me not to go to Inverness. Why, I have no idea. It&#8217;s a beautiful little city. The trip there north of Perth is gorgeous, with all the rolling hills. It&#8217;s the highlands there, and it&#8217;s the best way to see it all. Anyway, the city of Inverness is amazing. The River Ness seems almost Disney-esque in the way it cleanly cuts through town, with banks of green grass and the sprouting daffodils. Add to that the lovely old buildings, winding little roads, and the general hospitality of people (drunken football hooligans notwithstanding), you just can&#8217;t go wrong.</p>
<h4>Ramada Inverness</h4>
<p>Except for the Ramada Inverness. For the record, the location is excellent. But overall, I found their staff to be bordering on incompetent. There were a couple of shining stars, no question, but I kept running into people who couldn&#8217;t answer the most basic questions, such as telling me why I can&#8217;t make a long distance phone call. It drove me CRAZY. So sorry, Mom, I couldn&#8217;t call you on your birthday. I tried, really.</p>
<h4>High Tea at the Edinburgh Hilton Caledonian</h4>
<p>Just as good as we had the last time we were there. Outstanding service. Great food. Great tea. Just wish we could have been there longer. Such is life.</p>
<h4>York</h4>
<p>I finally got to spend some actual time in York. The last time we were there barely 5 hours, so didn&#8217;t see much of it. That said, I didn&#8217;t really understand the road map until well into the second day (I kept getting turned around) and even then still took wrong turns. Confusing, but I still love the place. I could easily do month-long stints there to do some photo essays: York at Night, York Minster&#8217;s Hidden Places, Up Close with the National Rail Museum, etc. Love it.</p>
<h4>York to St. Albans without going to London</h4>
<p>Big mistake. Too many switches, we missed a connection, and it&#8217;s too much movement. Going through London is out of the way, but it&#8217;s a lot easier.</p>
<h4>St. Albans</h4>
<p>I still love this little place. The last time, we swore we&#8217;d spend more time there the next time. But we ended up with not even 1 day again, sadly. One day, we will spend more time there. It&#8217;s a very nice place.</p>
<h4>Pictures</h4>
<p>Some are already <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/tags/scotland2008/">posted on Flickr</a>, and others will come once I get them all done.</p>

However, that said, there is NOTHING in the news about how the other terminals are faring at Heathrow airport. Does anyone know what baggage delays &#8212; if any &#8212; exist at the other terminals? Pileups at one surely must affect the others. Any and all pointers are appreciated! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love travelling &#8212; I honestly believe that I don&#8217;t do enough of it. Always makes me feel more energised, and sitting on my duff all day long really makes me pine for it.<br />
So I&#8217;m lucky to be getting around a bit in the next few months.<br />
<span id="more-894"></span>First, the family is off to Scotland again. This time, more Scotland than England. And no Ireland. Allen and Alex want to visit Iona. A week on a small rural island with ancient churches. I can&#8217;t think of a better place for a photo essay, myself. Then off to the Inverness area (hello, Nessie!), through York for a couple of days (a <em>whole day</em> in the National Railway Museum!), then home again. That&#8217;ll be early April.<br />
And, yes, El Bebe is coming with us. Not sure how this is going to work &#8212; both Alex and I are a bit apprehensive about the time difference. Alex has trouble with the shift &#8212; I can only imagine how the wee one will handle it. We&#8217;ve heard that this is the best time to travel with children, so they (kind of) get used to it. But it does mean we can&#8217;t move at my preferred break-neck pace. Instead of going right to Iona, it&#8217;s going to take two days from the time we land. I can hack that, though.<br />
Next up is a business trip to Chicago, which is actually first in the list, coming up in the second week of February. The Technology Department leadership (which includes me) will be trying to figure out our long-term plans and aspirations. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting session.<br />
Finally &#8212; at least currently on the radar &#8212; is a weekend in Las Vegas. I&#8217;m going down for Tamara&#8217;s wedding. That&#8217;s the second weekend in March. I haven&#8217;t been there in 12 years, so this should make for an interesting experience.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to get back on the road again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I&#8217;m no expert. I haven&#8217;t been everywhere or done everything. But one thing I have done is paid attention to public transit systems, especially the ones I&#8217;ve had to deal with on a daily basis.<br />
Such as the one in Calgary. You already know [[Calgary Transit Sucks|how I feel about our beloved transit system]]. And we&#8217;re long overdue to consider how much bigger it should be.<br />
<span id="more-861"></span>In fact, some replies to posts I did on [[Calgary Transit Sucks]] and [[Improving Calgary Transit in the city core]], and a half-argument I got into with someone waiting for the 301 led me to think: How does Calgary compare to other cities in terms of transit, anyway?<br />
Some cities I do have direct experience with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong><br />
Canada&#8217;s largest city. Hundreds of thousands of people need to enter and leave the city daily. It&#8217;s messy. <a href="http://www.gotransit.com">GO Transit</a> funnels people into the downtown core. <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ttc/">TTC</a> (subway, buses, streetcars) whisk people about town. The subway is nowhere near as extensive as it needs to be, having only started in the early 1950s  (when the city was less than a million people) and never having received the attention it needs. If it weren&#8217;t for a well-planned surface system, the city would be screwed.</li>
<li><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong><br />
Once Canada&#8217;s largest city (now #2), Montreal has perhaps one of Canada&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stm.info/">best public transportation systems</a>. This all stems from a signficant investment made in the mid-1960s in preparation for for <a href="http://expo67.ncf.ca/">Expo 67</a> &#8212; a large-scale subway system was installed. Combined with ages-old railway (Montreal was the headquarters of both <a href="http://www.cpr.ca">Canadian Pacific</a> and <a href="http://www.cn.ca">Canadian National Railways</a>, so was strewn with large train stations), and well-planned bus routes, Montreal is a public transit dream. Sadly, not one that seems to show up in a lot of case studies.</li>
<li><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong><br />
Despite a reputation for the surliest bus drivers in Canada (my friend Chris took serious issue with a few of them during his habitation in our Nation&#8217;s Capital for not listening to passengers, yelling at passengers, driving like a maniacs, etc.), Ottawa has a pretty decent system. Notably because someone saw fit to have <a href="http://www.octranspo.com/">OC Transpo</a> buy roads and make them dedicated transit ways. It&#8217;s helped keep the million-plus area flowing well. And the addition of the O-Train should help keep major corridors flowing even better. Problem: I&#8217;m sure this plan never accounted for the Ottawa area extending over the border into Hull.</li>
<li><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong><br />
Vancouver has a lot of trouble due to its physical and geopolitical limitations (mountains to the north, ocean to the west, USA to the south), which add up to some interesting problems for the population. Namely, they tend to live in a 20-kilometre wide swath from the Georgia Strait out to Hope. To get people around is <a href="http://www.translink.bc.ca/">an excellent bus system</a> (including rapid service buses on major routes), an ever-expanding light rail system (despite the NIMBYism in Point Grey), and the <a href="http://www.westcoastexpress.com/">West Coast Express</a> along the CP line (although the trains need to run all day, instead of just a few in the morning and a few in the evening &#8230; and run them until 23:00, would ya?).</li>
<li><strong>Kitchener/Waterloo/Cambridge, Canada</strong><br />
The tri-city area was once just Kitchener Transit. KW (as it was known when I went to university) were two cities that functioned as one. The <a href="http://www.grt.ca">Grand River Transit</a> system (as it&#8217;s now known) grew from a single small city system to cover three cities. And a lot more effectively than Calgary Transit seems to cover its measly self.</li>
<li><strong>New York City, USA</strong><br />
New York City is a true prototype of how to build a city: vertically. People live in skyscrapers, and travel quickly underground. The Big Apple&#8217;s first subway rolled along in the mid 1860s &#8212; a full century before Montreal got its Metro. <a href="http://www.mta.info/">New York&#8217;s system</a> covers five cities (now boroughs) and started when the population meter was barely at 830,000! And NYC is wholly dependent on the system &#8212; if the subways stop, the city goes into traffic gridlock. You can get anywhere in NYC by subway, and it&#8217;s simple for any visitor to pick up the system quickly. Trains and buses bring people in and out of the city, but inside, it&#8217;s the subway bringing the city to life.</li>
<li><strong>San Francisco, USA</strong><br />
Although San Francisco was late in getting its light rail (BART), San Francisco had already mastered ferries, trains, streetcars (the famous cable cars). Buses came later. And with San Francisco being on a peninsula, there was a lot of need to make it work well. Yes, SF was big when light rail finally came in (the SF area was huge) but this was to augment <a href="http://transit.511.org/">the transit system</a> already in place.</li>
<li><strong>London, England</strong><br />
London was the first to get an Underground in the mid-1860s. The city was already 1.6 million, though, and the Underground was to alleviate the trouble of travelling on the surface. All the trains, all the horse-drawn vehicles (and automobiles were fast-coming), and all the people were making movement nearly impossible. (Calgary &#8212; does this at all sound familiar? Well, maybe on with the horses during Stampede.) <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">London now is a paradise for public transit</a>, with outstanding subway systems, excellent rail services (for those of you who would beg to differ, I offer Canada as an example of how bad it can get), and well-marked bus services (you don&#8217;t need a map to know where you&#8217;re going).</li>
<li><strong>Paris, France</strong><br />
Given, Paris was about two million when the Metro arrived. Paris had similar problems to London &#8230; just with more people in a smaller space. The Metro saved Paris&#8217; population from having to survive travelling on roads and quickly get around. Today, <a href="http://www.ratp.fr/">Paris&#8217; Metro is fast, cheap, and effective</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Moscow, Russia</strong><br />
One of the largest in the world in terms of volume, the <a href="http://www.metro.ru/">Moscow Metro</a> has only been around since the 1930s. A bit more on the state-enforced development end, the Metro is something most Moscovites depend on, much in the way New Yorkers depend on the subway. No Metro, no Moscow.</li>
<li><strong>Shanghai, China</strong><br />
In addition to a great subway system (connected with China&#8217;s extensive rail system), Shanghai also has the world&#8217;s <a href="http://www.smtdc.com/en">first commercial magnetic levitation train</a>. It runs at high speed (over 400 km/h) to the airport. Sadly, it doesn&#8217;t do this from downtown Shanghai (which would make it truly exceptional), so it&#8217;s almost more kvitchy. I doubt Calgary would benefit from maglev, but such a train from Calgary to Edmonton would cover the distance in less than an hour.</li>
<li><strong>Hong Kong SAR, China</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.hkpt.com/">Buses</a>: super-comfortable and air-conditioned. <a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/prehome/index.html">Subway</a>: not very extensive, but at least runs out to the airport. Trains: not many, but they do run into China. <a href="http://www.hktramways.com/">Tramways</a>: Handy and cheap, when you&#8217;re in the Central/Admiralty areas of Hong Kong. Mind you, much of that area is small enough that you can walk on foot.</li>
<li><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong><br />
Tokyo and trains go hand-in-hand. <a href="http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/">No trains, no Tokyo.</a> Japan it heavily dependent on public transit because its made owning a car prohibitive. This is a lesson most of the rest of the world should learn: cars shouldn&#8217;t be considered necessities, except in some circumstances (e.g. ambulances). There is little that can&#8217;t be accomplished on your own two feet, with buses, trains, and subways covering the rest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calgary should be learning from cities such as these &#8212; especially its cousins in Canada &#8212; and learning what could be done to make things better. It should also look at its own history. Calgary used to have an interurban system that covered a lot of the city. Gone, and pretty much forgotten. But more extensive (by a wide margin) than the current C-Train.<br />
It&#8217;s not about planning for more roads. It&#8217;s not about ensuring there&#8217;s parking downtown. It&#8217;s about making better (that includes regularly-staffed, regularly-timed, and appropriately-equipped) bus routes, dedicated lanes during rush hours to funnel people in and out of downtown, [[Improving Calgary Transit in the city core|buried transit lines downtown]], more C-Train lines, and maybe (just maybe) trains to/from <a href="http://http://www.banffrailco.com/commuter.htm">High River, Canmore, Strathmore, and Airdrie</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s not like it hasn&#8217;t been done before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex slept better in a king-size hotel bed. Not so much for myself. I was tired. Grumpy. Irritable.<br />
That&#8217;s why I was particularly annoyed with the complete and utter disappearance of my deodorant (which I <em>know</em> I had with me) and two T-shirts. They&#8217;ve totally disappeared. I have no idea what the heck has happened to them.<br />
<span id="more-593"></span>Breakfast was very simple: cereal and a bagel. I&#8217;d have killed for a slice of process cheese, if that&#8217;s all I could have gotten. Breads aren&#8217;t what I really like, but I&#8217;ll take it if that&#8217;s all there is. We retreated to bed for a bit more sleep, which really didn&#8217;t help. The shower did, though.<br />
The missing items weren&#8217;t at Janice&#8217;s, and a quick sanity check proved they had in fact gone MIA. This mystery is going to bug me for a long time to come.<br />
We drove down to St. Thomas after picking up Janice and ate at the Beanery, a lovely little bistro that serves a decent BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s nothing compared to the authentic versions you get in the True South, but for a small town in Southern Ontario, it wasn&#8217;t bad.<br />
This was my first ever exposure to the Railway Capital of Canada. Once upon a time, St. Thomas was the most active hub in Canada for rail, sporting no less than eight separate rail lines. Today that&#8217;s dropped to only CN, CP, and maybe the GEXR. NYC is gone, L&amp;PS is little more than a tourist railroad, and CASO is now a mere memory. Maps still mark where most of the rails were, though only a few there can remember the glory days.<br />
I&#8217;m convinced beyond doubt that I was born about four decades too late. I could imagine being out in winter on a snowy night, listening to the slow moans and whistles of steam trains on the various lines as they moved around in the dark. All I saw today were a pair of Union Pacific diesels, no doubt burning up time on service with CP. The steam locomotives on the Port Stanley railway are locked up for the winter.<br />
After lunch, we dropped Janice off at the Presbyterian church and went off quickly to visit Alex&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s grave &#8212; also the site where her grandfather will be buried on Friday. Sadly, I will not see the funeral, as I need to head home to ensure that the Rolex redesign continues on schedule. Work has a nasty habit of wreaking havoc on my life.<br />
We attended the afternoon visitation. I recognized Kinella and Dugald, Janice&#8217;s sister and brother. The last time I&#8217;d seen them was our wedding reception in Oakville in September last year. The six of us (including Dugald&#8217;s wife) met about fifty or so people who came in to pay respects to Kenneth Campbell, a man I never met and whom I regret never knowing. He seemed like quite the man, and I&#8217;m sure he had many stories to tell. Such are the twists of fate in life.<br />
After the reception, Alex and I did a bit of touring around town before heading off to London so I could catch a train. I need to be on a plane tomorrow morning at 7:00. Originally, the funeral was scheduled for today, and this wasn&#8217;t a problem. The changing of times threw me off and all I&#8217;ve been able to do is attend the visitation. Once again, I miss the chance to meet more of Alex&#8217;s family.<br />
Dinner was at a place called J. Dee&#8217;s Market Grill. The &#8220;Market Grill&#8221; refers to the Covent Market Garden across the street. The Grill serves little more than hamburgers. Very good ones, I should add. But the selection is, shall we say, light?<br />
Timing was tight, but I made the train. As you&#8217;ve already seen in the previous rant, the internet access doesn&#8217;t seem to work properly. Someone else has theirs working, though, so I&#8217;ll have to try again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;m taking VIA from London to Oakville, saving Alex from another four hours of driving on Ontario&#8217;s highways. I&#8217;m sitting here with my trusty laptop trying to do some work, using the &#8220;Wi-Fi&#8221; service on-board.<br />
Except it doesn&#8217;t work.<br />
I can connect to the onboard gateway, no problem. It recognizes me and that I&#8217;ve been desperately trying to send and/or receive something. Anything in fact. It has my byte counts. What it doesn&#8217;t do is actually let me receive any data. So far, I&#8217;ve not even been able to pull up a Google search.<br />
I call false advertising! It doesn&#8217;t work, VIA &#8212; don&#8217;t tell me that it&#8217;s there if it doesn&#8217;t work. And it isn&#8217;t my laptop, as I know I can connect to virtually any wireless network I&#8217;ve ever seen. I can see yours but you won&#8217;t let me see anything else!<br />
Mind you, could be someone else on this train using up all the bandwidth for porn&#8230;<br />
(And if you&#8217;re wondering how on Earth I posted this despite not having any connectivity, I offer the simplistic Notepad + Copy &amp; Paste method.)<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: When we got past Brantford, it actually seemed to work, albeit not very well. I wouldn&#8217;t rely on VIA&#8217;s WiFi service for anything mission-critical, though it was still better than the next-to-nothing access I had with the CBC.]</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We arrived last night, around 20:00 local time. A quick run through the airport, and we were tracking through the back country out to Janice&#8217;s place in Kintore.<br />
The house was cool (old farm houses tend to lack a lot of insulation or it mostly needs to be replaced) so Alex was a little chilly most of the time. We watched <em><a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0479647/">Bon Cop Bad Cop</a></em> until around midnight or so (22:00 our time) before we were tired enough to go to sleep. I&#8217;d picked it up during what will be my last bout of Boxing Day sales. They&#8217;re hardly sales, since most of the prices (for the things I wanted) were still steep.<br />
<span id="more-591"></span>The cool house required several layers of blankets for warmth. I slept reasonably well. Alex didn&#8217;t, though more due to an inability to breathe. Janice&#8217;s house, in addition to being older, is much more humid (Ontario weather), dusty (due to age and size), and has two cats Alex&#8217;s immune system is unfamiliar with. End result: up much of the night.<br />
After giving up on trying to start Janice&#8217;s car, we got a lift from her neighbour back to the airport to pick up a rental car: a Dodge Calibur. We hadn&#8217;t asked for the Calibur &#8212; that&#8217;s what we were given. That&#8217;s what Enterprise defines as a &#8220;small car&#8221;. It&#8217;s certainly not the smallest thing on the roads, but it made for a comfortable ride out to Oakville. We figured it was a good chance to visit with family.<br />
Our first stop was at Burlington Mall to get Alex&#8217;s cousin Tara&#8217;s new baby a present. Then it was a 20 minute stop at Tara&#8217;s house before proceeding to Craig and Cathy&#8217;s. Tori was not in a mood to see us at all, and regularly ran away from both Alex and I. Turmoil is wreaking havoc with her, due to Craig working for the last several weeks in Windsor and Tori starting in day care so Cathy can go back to work.<br />
Our visit was too short, as always. We came in, chatted with Cathy and Craig, headed over to Mom&#8217;s for dinner for almost three hours, then were back on the road by 19:30 heading to London. Alex seems far more comfortable with driving in Southern Ontario than I am. Maybe I&#8217;ve become less tolerant of long-distance drives?<br />
Stopping briefly at Janice&#8217;s house again, we dropped off cat food and a new electric heating pad before heading off to the Quality Suites hotel in south London for the night. Alex needs her rest, and a room free of airborne irritants is important. Tomorrow, we join the rest of Alex&#8217;s family in St. Thomas for visitation. At some point, I&#8217;ve got to get back to Oakville for my flight home. Not sure yet how I&#8217;m going to do that&#8230;</p>

The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />

Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />

Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />

And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />

The forests often get thicker, too:<br />

Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />

This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />

Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />

We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />

A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />

Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />

This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />

Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />

We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />

I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />

At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />

Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03675.JPG" alt="No Flowing Back" width="300" /></a><br />
One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />

Ferry traffic!<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />

Jackie Chan apparently heavily sponsors California Fitness. He&#8217;s probably an owner.<br />

Inside our favourite dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong:<br />

We had this at a sushi restaurant in Chiba. We thought it was some weird pickled eel. It was eggplant:<br />
