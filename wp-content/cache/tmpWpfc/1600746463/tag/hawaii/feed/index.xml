										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex wanted a beach day. And beach day we had.<br />
Well, once we sat through a rather lengthy time share sales pitch, anyway.<br />
<span id="more-694"></span>That was part of the deal from the activity purchase. USD$100 off the total price if we sat through a &#8220;presentation&#8221;. They&#8217;re never just presentations. They&#8217;re geared to one thing and one thing only: effectively con you into purchasing something you really don&#8217;t need.<br />
For the record, the sales pitch is very convincing. Take what you spend on an average vacation. Multiply it by 25. Tack on inflation (be liberal and say only 2%). It comes out to a rather large chunk of change. Ours came out to the price of our house.<br />
That&#8217;s the first trick: slap you in the head with a paddle and get you to seriously think about how much you&#8217;re spending. Of course, these sorts of presentations are always set up in places where you&#8217;re spending a lot of money because the area is expensive. There&#8217;s a reason why you&#8217;ll find dozen of these things in Honolulu &#8230; and none in Death Valley.<br />
Next comes the advantages of signing up with the program. All the features of 5-star resorts, free access to any of the Wyndham properties (Wyndham was the company), concierge, full kitchens, bla bla bla.<br />
They play off the need for people to feel like they live more richly than they are. The appeal of saving money and getting to stay in places that should be normally above their means is an awfully hard thing to pass up.<br />
Thankfully, reality pervades in our lives. We don&#8217;t travel around the United States, so most of the properties are not in our travel plans. Now or ever (more than likely). Also, you need to book places like this far in advance. Alex and I don&#8217;t plan enough in advance because it ruins spontaneity. As for cost &#8212; we stay as cheaply as we can, and splurge only once in a while. We don&#8217;t go all out. Most of the cost of our trips goes to airfare.<br />
It takes a lot to tell them &#8220;no&#8221;. If you try to say &#8220;no&#8221;, they immediately get into financing plans. Thankfully, our agent gave us an out from the beginning, saying she didn&#8217;t want to hear &#8220;maybe&#8221;, only &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221;, and be as truthful as we could. The answer was &#8220;no&#8221;. It took a couple of hours, but we got out.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it wasn&#8217;t a waste of time. It was actually an interesting experience to see how these things operate. Who knows, maybe if we find the right sort of vacation property company, we might sign up. But it&#8217;s going to offer us far more than just the continental United States and a sole property in Canada.<br />
Returning to the hotel, we went for lunch at the grill before camping out for the afternoon on the grounds. Alex took shelter in shade to read. I went swimming in the bay.<br />
Only problem is that you need to keep an eye out for the Hawaiian Green Turtles that frequent the area. They don&#8217;t bite, but they&#8217;re endangered. And touching them is a serious no-no. They don&#8217;t know this however, and will come right at you because they&#8217;re not afraid of you.<br />
This is what drove me to rent a mask so I could see under the water. (If I&#8217;d been smart, I&#8217;d have gotten flippers, too.) Smart move, too, because the bay was full of all sorts of interesting sea life, including those cute colourful little fishes you see on the Discovery Channel.<br />
We headed to the Royal Kona Resort for about 17:00. Given that our last luau was perhaps the best in Hawaii (the Smith Family Luau on Kauai), this had a lot to live up to. We got our shell leis, access to non-stop drinks, and proceeded to mingle.<br />
The luau space is not huge, but adequate to the need. And the shoreline offers a wonderful view of the setting sun. The imu pit was a huge dirt mound, not nearly as fancy as the concrete and stone pits at Smith&#8217;s.  It did the effective cooking job, at least.<br />
The entertainment was pretty good, I must admit. The host is adequately cheesy, but without being horrible. The band loud without being obnoxious. And as always, there&#8217;s at least one member of the all-Polynesian revue who looks as white as the pure driven snow.<br />
The trees are well-arranged (whether or not it was intentional, I have no idea), the tables were a little cramped, but it wasn&#8217;t hard to see the show and mingle with everyone. I can imagine what it must be like on a busy night, though. The fire dancer was solid. Like the show we saw in Honolulu last year, there had to be a screen between him and the audience.<br />
Back at the hotel, we endulged in another evening of Law &amp; Order. Seems to be on TV all the time here.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, I know &#8212; why am I on a computer if I&#8217;m on vacation?<br />
Relax, I have good reason. Our house is now effectively sold, and for whatever reason we&#8217;ve been unable to fax properly from Hawaii back to Calgary. Very odd, indeed. However, when you need to communicate with your realtor and faxes don&#8217;t work, you resort to whatever &#8220;official&#8221; form of communication they suggest. In this case, email.<br />
Hence the computer. But given the trouble we&#8217;ve had, I&#8217;m sticking out for a few minutes to make sure it went through.<br />
<span id="more-685"></span>It&#8217;s already day 4, and I&#8217;m only just getting into a vacation now. Day 1 was spent trying to get here. Delayed departure due to weather, nearly missed the connecting flight in Denver, mechanical problems in Honolulu put us late into Kona. And my bag? Yeah, left behind in Denver.<br />
Hint to United Airlines: If a plane comes in late, allow time for bags to be sent through properly. And when someone calls in to ask about the whereabouts of their bag, don&#8217;t lie to them, either.<br />
Day 2 was finding my bag. Ugh.<br />
Day 3 we went up and down the coast a bit before going out on a &#8220;dinner cruise&#8221;. The locals refer to it as a &#8220;booze cruise&#8221;. Not great when you can&#8217;t drink. And there&#8217;s a very loud bridal party.<br />
Today, we went to a timeshare presentation. No, we didn&#8217;t buy one (if we&#8217;d had the money, we would have, though). It took $100 off our activities cost, so we couldn&#8217;t say &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />
Anyway, time&#8217;s almost up and there&#8217;s been no bounce with the email, so I presume all is good. Back to trying to forget about computers for a few more days&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, there&#8217;s nothing like waking up on a sunny day. Even better, there&#8217;s nothing like clean underwear.<br />
After a hearty breakfast, we made an effort to do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Book a dinner cruise (they&#8217;re usually fun)</li>
<li>Book a luau (same reason)</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-690"></span>This led us to Amanda, the Expedia Local Expert. I had no idea these things existed. Apparently they&#8217;re all over Maui. Technically, a Microsoft employee who knows a lot about the area, gets you good rates on the otherwise expensive activities, and can suggest a few things to check out.<br />
She would also sell us on swimming with dolphins (&#8220;they swim right up to you&#8221; if you&#8217;re pregnant) and booked us in with some presentation thing to knock off USD$100 off our activity bill. I sense &#8220;timeshare&#8221;, but we&#8217;ll see.<br />
Booking in hand, we went south in search of &#8230; stuff. If I&#8217;m gonna fly 7,000 kilometres, I want to see more than just the hotel. Especially if there&#8217;s historical stuff in the area. I can&#8217;t sit on a beach for more than a few hours without going loco.<br />
My goal? Pu&#8217;uhonau o Honaunau, a place of refuge. According to the books, any violation of <em>kapu</em>, ancient Hawaiian law, was met with one punishment: death. Since that tends to put a damper on things like living a long life, someone had the sense to create places of refuge where people could attempt to escape (they weren&#8217;t easy to get into, since that would defeat the purpose of <em>kapu</em>), and get absolution for whatever crime they committed. If they died in the attempt, well, they were sentenced to die anyway, right?<br />
There&#8217;s only one road to get there. And it took a while. Along the way we stopped in Kainaliu, one of many little towns that sprung up during Hawaii&#8217;s agricultural burst in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They&#8217;re the last refuge of the old general stores, which dot the road south from Kailua.<br />
Old theatres. Interesting little stores. Donkey Balls. (Not joking. They&#8217;re chocolate-covered macadamia nuts. But I love the name.) And even Dog the Bounty Hunter. (Well, Da Kine Bail Bonds, anyway.) Alex nearly freaked, though the shock took a mile or two to set in.<br />
Lunch was a real pain. We couldn&#8217;t get into <a href="http://www.coffeeshack.com/">The Coffee Shack</a> that Amanda had recommended &#8212; too full. So went in search of other things. Not open. Not appropriate. Not food (minor issue, really). We stopped at the Painted Church along the way. A very neat place.<br />
I thought, rather naively, that Pu&#8217;uhonau o Honaunau might have food. So we drove the 10 minutes to the park, only to find out it didn&#8217;t. We had to double-back almost a half hour back to The Coffee Shack, which finally had space.<br />
It&#8217;s a neat place that has a killer view off the patio. Decent food, if a bit pricey. Killer desserts. And you get to watch geckos while you eat. How cool is that?<br />
Following our repast, we went all the way back to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/puho/">Pu&#8217;uhonau o Honaunau</a>. We managed to sneak in without paying due to a wad of confusion the first time we went there.<br />
It&#8217;s a lot more desolate than I would have thought. Mind you, all the Hawaiian heiau I&#8217;ve seen so far are pretty &#8230; well, plain. There&#8217;s not much beyond the walls. The wooden buildings are long gone, so the only sign of anything important is the stuff built of solid rock.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay long, needing to run back to the hotel to change and catch a bus downtown for the Captain Bean&#8217;s Cruise. It looks great on paper. But it&#8217;s got another name the locals use: The Booze Cruise. If only we&#8217;d known&#8230;<br />
The bus, a Roberts Hawaii bus, arrived on time. A couple of older folks and us got on, only to have to wait for another party. A bachelorette party. A loud bachelorette party. I could only seeing this going from bad to worse.<br />
The barge, effectively what the boat is, awaited us at the pier. We checked in, got our boarding pass (kinda hokey), two drink tickets (one each), and had our photos taken.<br />
The area is made mostly of square tables set into the floor, where you eat and watch the entertainment. Although there is an upstairs, passengers aren&#8217;t allowed up there. Too bad, really, since it would have been a nice reprieve from the band. Good, but a little too loud for me.<br />
It was a smooth cruise, taking about two hours. Sometimes didn&#8217;t even remember we were on a boat. The food was pretty good, too, but the corn was way overcooked. We were pretty happy when we got back to our hotel.<br />
The bachelorette party tried to pick up two of the male dancers on board. They were super-loud on the way back (the lives of the party).<br />
I must be getting old&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We slept last night with the sliding door to the balcony open (with the screen door closed) and the air conditioning off. A bit humid, but wow, does one feel better with fresh air in your lungs.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve slept so well in &#8230; months.<br />
<span id="more-689"></span>We awoke to the remnants of a rainstorm, and a double rainbow out on the water. In the light, we could see a much nicer view of the hotel grounds and of the bay just north of the hotel. Surfers were already out in force.<br />
After a buffet breakfast (there&#8217;s nothing like fresh pineapple) we came back for much needed showers and to change into clothes for the day. Well, Alex did. I couldn&#8217;t. No bag. It&#8217;s still lost.<br />
Calling United Airlines didn&#8217;t help. I was blatantly lied to. My bag is in Honolulu. Okay, so I called Aloha. Nope. Not in Honolulu. Not in Kona, either. In fact, not with Aloha at all. Call United.<br />
I was cheesed that I had to call <em>anybody</em>, for the record. When <a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/05/01/the-tale-of-the-missing-backpack/">British Airlines lost my bag</a> (mostly due to my fault, I should add), they delivered it to me at my hotel. Not remotely as much stress as I&#8217;m under now.<br />
So I call United back. I explain that I&#8217;m not happy in as pleasant a way as possible. In reality, I&#8217;m about two seconds from tearing the poor agent several new holes. I very much dislike being lied to.<br />
(Vacation&#8217;s getting off to a great start, ain&#8217;t it?)<br />
The bag&#8217;s in Denver, still. A couple more questions, and I find out that, no, it&#8217;s actually in Los Angeles. My friggin&#8217; bag is getting around more than I am. I should be thankful, really &#8212; 15 years ago, this would be beyond hell. I ask very bluntly when the bag will appear on the Big Island. At this point, couldn&#8217;t care less about whether it&#8217;ll come to my hotel automatically, I&#8217;ll pick the damned thing up.<br />
After a few minutes on hold, I&#8217;m told they&#8217;ll call me when it arrives. Great. I still have to suffer through 25 degree heat with pants and heavy shoes. My shorts and sandals are in transit.<br />
Now to really amaze me, we got a phone call no less than 30 minutes after we left the hotel room that my bag had arrived in Kona. Apparently, I was lied to the <em>second</em> time I called United. Not happy. Not happy at all.<br />
We drove down to the Coconut Place mall (not really a mall &#8212; more a collection of shops, really) where Alex made a beeline for the Crocs store. While there, I got a phone call from our realtor about our house.<br />
We&#8217;re still clearing conditions. Financing and house inspection. The report was back from inspection, and the net of it wasn&#8217;t surprising. Floor damage. Siding missing (has to be replaced, still), and the stairs at the back are unattractive (buy try and break &#8217;em &#8212; I dare ya!). And it&#8217;s dirty.<br />
DIRTY? I just about went ape on the poor woman. Never tell an already stressed guy who&#8217;s wearing the same clothes for 36 hours and has had a very bad morning with an airline regarding a missing bag that the house he&#8217;s selling (and packing up to move out of) is &#8220;dirty&#8221;.<br />
Ugh.<br />
Further down the road, we found the Kona Marketplace. And I caved in and bought new sandals. I had to &#8212; my feet were dying.<br />
Returning to the room, I got the message my bag had arrived. I figured an hour to the airport and back would suffice.<br />
Problems: Kailua-Kona has bad traffic (not enough roads; too many people). And several others were trying to find their bags, too. I barely made it back in time for dinner. I was unfairly grumpy at my return.<br />
Dinner was good, though expensive (always are at hotels). Excellent waiter, though. Good service goes a long way to improving one&#8217;s attitude, I find.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oy. This vacation is not off to a good start.<br />
One of the conditions of this vacation was that we were to incur no red-eye flights (in other words, no sleeping on the plane). That meant getting there and back was going to cause some difficulty in how we went from Calgary (a second-tier airport) to Kona (a second-to-third tier airport). Direct flight? Hah!<br />
<span id="more-686"></span>Calgary to Denver. Denver to Honolulu. Honolulu to Kona. About 14 hours all told, including running through airports to catch connecting flights.<br />
The drive out to the airport this morning was a little worrisome. We&#8217;d been hearing since yesterday morning that we were going to have a serious snowfall. Being Calgary, that means a <em>lot</em> of snow, not just a little. And a lot of snow tends to wreak havoc with flights.<br />
At 5:30, the DJs on the radio were suggesting people start to work in advance of the coming blizzard. I was not exactly thrilled with our chances. But we saw no snow all the way to the airport.<br />
Checked in, went through US Customs and through security (both remarkably easy, for a change) and went to have something to eat. Alex wanted a bagel, which was not to be found anywhere. I&#8217;d have settled for napkin if that&#8217;s all that could be had. Airlines don&#8217;t feed you anymore, not even pretzels, so you&#8217;ve got to cover your own food issues.<br />
Waiting at the gate, I realized that I couldn&#8217;t see downtown. From the gate (which I&#8217;ve left through before), I normally can.<br />
Then I couldn&#8217;t see Nose Hill.<br />
Damn.<br />
Snow was falling as I walked down the gangway into the plane. I already knew we were going to have to de-ice, putting us behind schedule. And we didn&#8217;t have a long time to make our connecting flight in Denver. Ninety minutes goes more quickly than you think.<br />
For some reason, a lot of flights leave Calgary at around 8:00. And they all needed de-icing. Thirty minutes passed before we finally started to taxi to the runway. Start. Stop. Start. Stop. I was starting to crawl the walls. Alex was probably ready to divorce me on the spot and find another seat in the plane.<br />
Never put an already stressed out person on a plane that doesn&#8217;t leave on schedule. It&#8217;s not pretty.<br />
Finally, the engines wound up, the roar filled the cabin, and the plane started down the runway &#8230; only to stop about 250 metres down. The plane turned off onto one of the taxiways while Alex prepared to peel me off the ceiling.<br />
Something hardware-related. After 20 minutes, the pilot announced that it was fixed, and that as soon as they&#8217;d filed their paperwork, we&#8217;d be off. I almost bit through my tongue to prevent from yelling: &#8220;FILL IT OUT WHEN WE&#8217;RE AIRBORNE!&#8221;<br />
Now, for the record, I totally understand why this is done on the ground. My desire to get out of Calgary pretty much cancelled out all reason.<br />
We arrived in Denver quite late. Twenty-five minutes before our next flight left. In at Gate 8, out at Gate 94. (Or something like that &#8230; a long way down, either way.) Denver is a LONG airport.<br />
The next flight left on time. In the back of my head, I knew this was a problem. I knew this would be an issue. And it was.<br />
It&#8217;s a seven hour flight to Honolulu from Denver. That&#8217;s seven hours with only one movie (<em>Happy Feet</em>) and no meals. WTF. It&#8217;s a friggin&#8217; long flight, and you want me to shell out $5 for a crappy box with a couple of crackers, some cream cheese, apple sauce, and cookies? I don&#8217;t even like cream cheese!<br />
If my Dad hadn&#8217;t been cremated, he&#8217;d be spinning so fast in his grave the whirring would sound like a power drill. That&#8217;s just spectacularly poor, folks. (That&#8217;s United Airlines, in case anyone&#8217;s wondering.)<br />
Arriving in Honolulu, we were greeted with the moist warmth that comes after a rainfall. For a moment, time actually slowed down while we walked from one part of the terminal to another (outside) to pick up our bags. For a moment, everything was great.<br />
A moment later, it all came crashing down again. I found Alex&#8217;s bag about two seconds before I heard:<br />
&#8220;Paging United passenger Alexandra &#8230; Sohr-ee&#8221;.<br />
They always fuck up the last name. It&#8217;s not rocket science, people. Sowrey. Sow-ree. Say it with me &#8230; SOW-REE.<br />
My bag, which had gone on the plane at the same time as Alex&#8217;s, hadn&#8217;t made it from Denver. I was clothes-less. Sandal-less. Toothpaste-less. (Alex, as I had her makeup bag in my bag, was toiletry-less.) But United did provide us with two &#8220;temporary&#8221; toiletry kits, containing the smallest damned toothpaste I&#8217;ve ever seen, and a deodorant stick that &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say I was pretty surprised that it worked. My bag, so they say, will arrive tomorrow.<br />
We went over to Aloha Airlines in the Interisland wing and booked in for our next flight. Badda-bing, badda-boom, and we&#8217;re standing in front of Gate 52 for out last flight of the day.<br />
We&#8217;ve flown Aloha before. Nice, easy, fast. Just like WestJet, only smaller. And no pre-assigned seats.<br />
The plane backed out from the gate, and slowly spun so we could nose forward under our own power. Then something went &#8230; bad. It felt sort of like the nose gear suddenly spun sideways &#8212; something it&#8217;s not supposed to do. At first, it was just curiousity why we were sitting there. Then the pilot came on, telling us that we might have to go back to the gate.<br />
Figures.<br />
Sure enough, 20 minutes later, we&#8217;re back at the gate, filing out to line up at Gate 53 for another plane, yet to arrive. A little over an hour after we were to depart, we finally left Honolulu airport (successfully) for our 45 minute jaunt to Kona.<br />
Kona&#8217;s a neat little airport &#8212; doesn&#8217;t even look like a traditional airport, it&#8217;s all little huts, and most of the operations are outside. Funky.<br />
Got Alex&#8217;s bag, hopped on the Budget bus to pick up the rental car, and nearly got lost getting to the hotel. We missed the sunset. The <a href="http://www.expedia.ca/pub/agent.dll?qscr=dspv&amp;htid=151125&amp;itid=187705779&amp;from=i">Outrigger Keauhou Beach Resort</a> ain&#8217;t exactly the ritz, but at 3.5 stars (according to Expedia), I felt it should have been better.<br />
Mind you, I could just be in a really sour mood given the day I&#8217;ve had.</p>
