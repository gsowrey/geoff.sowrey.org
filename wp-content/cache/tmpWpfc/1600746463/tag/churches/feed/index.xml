										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My dogs are barkin&#8217;. It&#8217;s been a day on my feet. A good day, to be sure, but a lot of walking, and a lot of standing. The same was true for Alex, and it would be for Mi Pequeña Niña if she hadn&#8217;t slept for a solid hour or so while we were walking about. (Considering that was her only nap of the day, that&#8217;s not a bad thing, either.)<br />
The way started out as a rough plan to go to the Empire State Building, and check out the view of Manhattan. But our plans here are very flexible. Aside from the fact that I&#8217;ve been to New York City twice before, we&#8217;re travelling with a napping toddler, who is apt to change our plans at a moment&#8217;s notice for any number of reasons. So I try not to go too crazy when plans are forced to change.  <br />
(Emphasis on the word &#8220;try&#8221;.)<br />
<span id="more-1194"></span>Following a decent breakfast, we dressed for our run out to the CitiGroup building, and hop the E train eastwards to the 7th Ave station, where we switched to a northbound B train to 81st St. The stop, for those of you who don&#8217;t know, for the American Museum of Natural History. I&#8217;d seen it once before from the outside, but had really wanted to visit it since seeing &#8220;A Night At the Museum&#8221;.  <br />
A couple of things about the New York Subway system:<br />
  </p>
<ol>
<li>Accessibility. Not everyone has two capable feet. Some people require wheels, from those in wheelchairs to parents who try to get around with strollers. I&#8217;m amazed that not only are many stations on the system not equipped with ramps and elevators, in order to get in or out of the system, you need a station attendant to unlock the &#8220;service&#8221; gates (or trip the alarm on your way out).  </li>
<li>Not every person riding the subway is from the United States of America. So asking for a ZIP code when you want to use a credit card to purchase tickets is really short-sighted. (A note for those of you in our boat: punch in &#8220;99999&#8221;, &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s not posted anywhere.)</li>
<li>Allow people to purchase more than one ticket at a time, or at least suggest how you can use the same Metrocard for more than one person. Take a few lessons from the London Underground, who have this down to an artform.  </li>
<li>There is no better place to find amateur musicians. Why most of these people don&#8217;t have music on iTunes for sale is beyond me.  </li>
</ol>
<p>  <br />
The main entrance to the AMNH is made up of three small revolving doors. Not suitable for all strollers, certainly not ours. I had to go in through the planetarium entrance and work my way back to the main entrance. Which wasn&#8217;t easy due to malfunctioning elevators (and a near total lack of signage for alternatives). I&#8217;m certain that Alex (who went in through the main entrance) was wondering where Mi Pequeña Niña and I were.  <br />
When we did finally meet up in the main entrance hall, I was supremely disappointed. That massive entranceway in &#8220;A Night At The Museum&#8221;? About a third of that size. No statue of Teddy Roosevelt on horseback. No round front desk. There is a dinosaur &#8212; three, actually. But it&#8217;s just not as impressive. (Other things that seemed to be missing: Dioramas of railway builders and Roman legions, Civil war soldiers, and an Egyptian wing with a golden plaque that brings things together at night. But I digress.)<br />
Our first stop was at a temporary exhibit &#8212; a butterfly garden. It is with supreme irony that we flew five hours from Costa Rica to visit a butterfly garden with specimens from Costa Rica. (And in greater numbers than we&#8217;ve experienced before.) MPN was enthralled with all the butterflies, with them fluttering all about. The guides there (all volunteers) were all really well-educated about butterflies, too.  <br />
We moved on from there, moving to the 1st floor, in search of the Spitzer Hall of Human Evolution. (Alex would have a PhD in Anthropology by now if she&#8217;d known about anthropology before going into university.) To get there, we went through the Hall of Biodiversity, the Environment of New York State (featuring exhibits that hadn&#8217;t been dusted in at least 40 years &#8212; and looked about that dated), before passing a café on the south-west side.  <br />
It gave us a chance for a quick bite (I eschewed the $10.50 sandwiches), before we entered the Spitzer Hall. That was about when MPN finally passed out. Alex read every letter of every sign in the hall. I scanned many of them, reading more into the things that interested me more (e.g. the various branches of evolution that led to homo sapiens, and especially those branches that turned out to be dead-ends. (I still want to know where Neanderthals came from, and why they died out.)  <br />
While Alex continued to review evolution, I strayed along, eventually finding my way into another &#8220;hall&#8221; (the Arthur Ross Hall) dedicated wholly to meteorites. In the centre of the room was a particularly large specimen, Ahnighito (so dubbed by the Inuit of Greeland), is effectively a massive chunk of iron clocking in at a serious 34 tons. (That&#8217;s Imperial tons, by the way &#8212; some 68,000+ pounds.) It doesn&#8217;t look like it weighs 34 tons when you first see it. But when you touch it, you suddenly feel the weight of its mass and the distance it&#8217;s travelled.  I also ducked into the hall of minerals next door (at one point, I was a budding geologist) before returning to Alex and we continued our excursion around the museum.  <br />
The Hall of North American Mammals, the Hall of North American Tourists (otherwise known as  the gift shop), and finally the exit back to the subway to return to the hotel.  <br />
This being Christmas Eve, we planned to hit a Christmas service. I suggested St. Patrick&#8217;s Cathedral, a particualrly wonderful example of gothic architecture just across the street from Rockefeller Center. But when we arrived, we found that we weren&#8217;t the only ones with the idea. Most of Manhattan gets this idea. Tickets for the event were apparently sold out by Labor Day.  <br />
Fortunately, there&#8217;s a non-denominational church nearby (though I think its roots are in the Anglican church) called St. Bart&#8217;s. We popped in there to find plenty of seating. The only problem with the service, sadly, was MPN, who would have none of this sitting still crap. Alex and I ended up having to take turns keeping her pinned down (or occupied) as not to disturb the entire church. Murdo&#8217;s talk of hearing MPN&#8217;s &#8220;music&#8221; was not echoed here.  <br />
When we left, it was raining. Yes, raining. It&#8217;s Christmas in New York, and it&#8217;s raining. The chill we first felt at landing is now gone, and I find the weather much warmer. Why didn&#8217;t we stay at home in Costa Rica?, you&#8217;re asking, I&#8217;m sure.  <br />
Alex made a desperate last-dash to a nearby CVS (drugstore) for some Christmasy things, such as a string of lights (very important), some decorations (right out of the classic &#8220;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#8221; TV special), and the only tradition that we&#8217;ve had every year thus far &#8212; Turtles (the chocolate kind).  <br />
And on that note, it&#8217;s now time for us to go to bed. So to all of you, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, you read that right. I drank coffee. Not a coffee-flavoured beverage, not something with Kahlua. Coffee. Real. Honest. Caffeinated.<br />
Those of you who know me are probably all thinking the same thing: Uh oh.<br />
I offer you the following piece of encouragement: Don&#8217;t panic. I&#8217;m not an addict. Yet.<br />
<span id="more-1158"></span>So why now? Well, it was partly a snap decision, though there was a wee bit of premeditation to it. Mark had suggested that we take a trip out to the <a href="http://www.orosivalley.com/">Orosi Valley</a>, a region about 30 kilometres east of San Jose. The valley is one of the major coffee-producing areas of Costa Rica, which is evident mere moments after entering the area &#8212; you can&#8217;t miss the rows of coffee plants.<br />
I opted to make this a &#8220;surprise&#8221; journey, and didn&#8217;t really tell Alex where we were going. As usual, this led to an endless string of placenames as Alex tried (unsuccessfully) to guess. This time, I figured I had her, since the route was convoluted enough that should wouldn&#8217;t be able to easily stumble across it. (On <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/09/17/weekend-at-tabacon/">our previous journey</a>, she knew we were going to Arenal within minutes of us leaving National Route 1.)<br />
Thanks to Hermes, we now had a faster way of getting around San Jose (the route we had known goes through San Jose, and takes well over an hour), which deposited us on the other site quite quickly. From there, the trip out was fairly uneventful, taking us past Tres RÃƒ ­os (the furthest east we had been to that point), over a fairly steep rise in the valley, then down into Cartago.<br />
Cartago is a place of pilgrimage for many Costa Ricans, notably for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuestra_Señora_de_los_Angeles_Basilica">Nuestra Señora de los Angeles Basilica</a>. It&#8217;s the home of the Virgin of the Angels, the patron (saint?) of Costa Rica. But that&#8217;s not what we were going out to see (at least, not this time). Although we did drive past the basilica, we only had the time to glance. We were still bound for our destination.<br />
(I should point out that &#8220;time&#8221; was a consideration. The Premier of China is in Costa Rica, and his arrival was wreaking havoc with traffic as they shut down highways to ease his travels. This meant we had to plan our travels carefully so we wouldn&#8217;t be caught in anything.)<br />
We continued to Paraiso, where I instructed Alex to look for a road sign to &#8220;Orosi&#8221;. Another diversion, since we weren&#8217;t actually going to the town of Orosi. Instead, towards the edge of the south side of Paraiso, we hung a left and started a weavy, windy, and steep drive down into the Orosi Valley.<br />
There are few places in the world I&#8217;ve been that stand out as being truly gorgeous. This is the sort of place I&#8217;d kill to be on a bike for a (sunny) day, just me &#8230; and my camera equipment, of course. High walls seem to surround the valley floor, which is largely taken up with a lake formed by the damming of the El RÃ­o Grande (used for hydroelectric power). The end of the lake near the dam is filled with floating vegetation, which offers a very picturesque view of the area.<br />
Shortly after 11:30, we arrived at <a href="http://www.lacasonadelcafetal.com/">La Casona del Cafetal</a>, a restaurant hidden 500 metres from the road in the middle of a coffee plantation. We&#8217;d come for the buffet (this was the root of the surprise), which is filled with traditional Costa Rican foods. Although some of the staff do speak English (far better than I can speak Spanish), that&#8217;s about where the catering to gringos stops. After that, it&#8217;s all Tico. I think Alex, Mi Pequeña Niña, and I were the only gringos there.<br />
Which, really, is fine with me.<br />
La Casona is perched on a small rise overlooking the lake. Although the day was cloudy, the view was still fantastic. I&#8217;m sure on a sunny day, the view can&#8217;t be beat. It was definitely a great place to go for brunch.<br />

All morning, Alex and I had thought MPN was sick. She was sneezing a lot, her nose was running, and she had teary eyes. (We would later check with Nana &#8212; my mom &#8212; to get confirmation that it was just teething. Oddly enough, my little girl has yet to have a cold.) None of the ooziness seemed to diminish her appetite as she tore into almost everything put in front of her. (She avoided the carrots.)<br />
Being in the middle of a coffee plantation, I figured this place had to have good coffee. I kept asking Alex if she wanted one. At first she didn&#8217;t, but after getting some food, she changed her mind. And when she said &#8220;sÃ­ ­&#8221;, I added &#8220;dos&#8221;.  You could have knocked Alex over with a feather.<br />
It reminded me of when I first started to drink alcohol. Yep, time for a flashback&#8230;<br />
New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1995. It would be my last New Year&#8217;s in Ottawa &#8212; I got the flu the following year, and the year after that I was preparing to move from Toronto to Vancouver. But in 1995, a small platoon of us had traveled up to Ottawa, and were arranged around a massive circular table at the <a href="http://www.yangtze.ca/">Yangtze chinese restaurant</a> along Somerset, about four blocks from Chris&#8217; apartment.<br />
There were around 20 of us (a bit of a guess, my memory is a little fuzzy for obvious reasons), all of whom knew each other quite well. And one thing they all knew about me: I didn&#8217;t drink. It wasn&#8217;t for any reason, that&#8217;s just the way it was. Everyone accepted it &#8212; razzed me about it, I should add &#8212; but never forced anything.<br />
The waitress was taking orders, going around the table one person at a time, getting the list of people. When she got to Therese, Stuart, and Liz, the three of them decided to order a bottle of wine between them and asked if anyone else wanted some. For some reason &#8212; and likely no more reason than &#8220;just &#8216;cuz&#8221; &#8212; I decided that it might be nice to have some, too. Somehow, between all the commotion in the restaurant, the confusion of orders, and my not-quite-seen (or heard) motions, everyone missed that I&#8217;d put myself in with the order. Including the waitress, although she&#8217;d heard the &#8220;me, too&#8221;.<br />
When the waitress returned with the wine and four glasses, she could only figure out where the first three were supposed to go. She asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who had the fourth glass of wine?</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>That would be me.</p></blockquote>
<p>You could have heard a pin drop. The entire table was silent &#8212; the only time for the next many hours that these people would be silent &#8212; and stayed that way for couple of heartbeats. The moment was broken by Stuart, who chipped in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Geoff&#8217;s gettin&#8217; liquored tonight!</p></blockquote>
<p>Such was the experience when Alex heard me order a coffee. For a moment she thought that I was correcting her order, and almost got our waitress to change it. She caught herself about to speak, and then looked at me in sheer shock. Me, her husband of 3 1/4 years, whom had shunned all coffee for the entirety of his life, was about to have a first cup.<br />
Drama, of course, ensued. The moment, for you doubters, was even captured on video.<br />
Now there are a significant number of people whom I&#8217;ve met over the years who were (and in many cases, still are) abjectly terrified of the idea of me drinking coffee. Certainly, a third of my life ago, that would definitely be true. Drinking that much caffeine as a younger man might have well turned me into a Jekyll and Hyde sort of personality (if you doubt me, ask the people who knew me in university), and that prospect scared the bejeezus out of them.<br />
One advantage of age: calm. Well, as calm as a guy like me can get. And frankly, calm enough that I wanted to try coffee. Living in Costa Rica, I feel like I&#8217;m being left out whenever I pass the coffee aisle (I jest not!) and savour the aroma. I love the smell of coffee, and the taste of coffee in things that I&#8217;ve eaten and drank. But coffee itself? I&#8217;d seen too many addicts of coffee to want to go that far&#8230;<br />
Still, I had to know.<br />
The coffee came not as a simple cup, but as a <a href="http://www.zurqui.com/crinfocus/cr/coffee.html">chorreador</a>. This is the way you drink coffee Costa Rican-style. The waitress poured in the hot water, and we waited for the coffee to fill the brown mug underneath. When it was ready, I sniffed at the steam that wafted from the top, not unlike sampling the nose of a fine wine (Alex probably thinks it was a wasted effort &#8212; the coffee was actually too strong).<br />
[flickr]photo:3039229692(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:3039229726(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
The first sip brought forth the taste of &#8230; well, coffee beans. I know, I know, that sounds like a really stupid thing to say, but the reality is that this was not exactly what I&#8217;d expected. Having only ever tasted coffee blended with other things, the taste of the other things masked some of the coffee flavour. So it wasn&#8217;t quite what I was expecting.<br />
[flickr]photo:3039232914(small)[/flickr]<br />
But it was far from bad.<br />
And yes, I liked it.<br />
In fact, as I continued to drink the cup, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that things seem to look almost a little different. Colours seemed to be more saturated. Details became a little sharper. Everyone seemed to move just a little bit more slowly.<br />
Alex just continued to make fun of this, mockingly worried that we were going to have to set up a full import business to keep up to my coffee habit. (I hadn&#8217;t even finished my first cup.) I drank it straight, black, no sugar. I figured I had to know what true coffee tastes like before I start adding other things to it.<br />
Oddly enough, the drive home seemed to go a little more quickly than the drive in, even though I took a couple wrong turns (as I&#8217;ve mentioned before, not all the roads here are well-marked).  And I had serious trouble sleeping.<br />
Not that I think it&#8217;s at all related.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the few minutes I have before I dive back into another conference session, figured I&#8217;d cover some of the items of our last vacation. This was a 2.5 week excursion mostly to Scotland, with a few days in England. Alex planned most of the trip, with me handling things like the transportation and hotels to stay along the way. Overall, about a 50/50 split on the events et al.<br />
Sadly, at the end, it wasn&#8217;t a usual vacation. Until now, it&#8217;s always been either just me, or myself and Alex. Now there&#8217;s three of us, and the Wee One doesn&#8217;t have our stamina for travel and has a pseudo-schedule that needs to be followed from time-to-time.<br />
<span id="more-928"></span></p>
<h4>British Airways</h4>
<p>We flew BA from Calgary to London (via Heathrow). Air Canada &#8212; are you listening? These are the guys you should be looking to for level of service. Wow. Allow me to describe: We arrive at the plane along the jetway, with stroller (and babe) in hand. They tell us that they might not be able to bring the stroller on-board, but they&#8217;d let us know. They didn&#8217;t ask for seat or name &#8212; they figured it out on their own, checked the stroller, and gave us the claim ticket. They presented us with a small toy bag for the Wee One with a small stuffed plane for playtime. Free wine. Good (read: real) food. A feeling like people actually cared about the passengers&#8217; well-being. Excellent in-flight entertainment for that 8-9 flight. Sure, it costs a bit extra. But not so much that I wouldn&#8217;t even think twice about flying with them again &#8212; that&#8217;s a definite.</p>
<h4>Travelling with the Wee One</h4>
<p>Most people thought we were nuts for hauling our offspring to Europe. A seven hour time difference, air travel, trains, ferries, lots of packing and moving, and add an infant to all of that?<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2007/11/24/we-have-a-travel-safe-baby/">I said it before</a>, but our kid rocks. Sleep on the flight out (sadly, not so much on the way back), adjustment to the timezone in two nights (by the third day, all was well), played a lot on the trains (although she did have trouble sleeping due to lack of space), and she didn&#8217;t keep us up at night even though we were all in the same room. It didn&#8217;t matter how many places we went or how many people wanted to hold her (the Wee One apparently is the cutest thing many Brits have ever seen, judging by the near-endless stream of comments we got).<br />
And hey, I got to spend 2.5 of constant time with my child! What on Earth could be wrong with that?<br />
About the only bad thing (if you could call it that) was one bad habit picked up by a three-week older infant, and now the raspberry has entered the vocabulary.</p>
<h4>Iona and the Iona Community</h4>
<p>This was our first stop. Iona is a small island off the coast of the Isle of Mull, which is in turn off the western coast of Scotland. (The nearest major port is Oban, in case you&#8217;re looking for a geographical reference.) The day we arrived, there was a viciously strong and cold north wind. We immediately regretted having arrived, but pressed on. The Community itself runs mostly out of the Iona Abbey, which is owned and operated by Historical Scotland. For a week, we were guests, and basically had free run of the place.<br />
That said, a week at a Christian commune (even an ecumenical one) takes a bit of a toll on the less- (or non-)devout. Although the people were wonderful &#8212; and I have to say that while I lamented the absence of meat in our meals, the things they can do with vegetables are stunning &#8212; I was happy to be on the road again for the mainland.<br />
It&#8217;s a very small island, so it&#8217;s (relatively) easy to get around on it. Though parts of it are very boggy, you can cross the island in about 30 minutes, and go the length in about three times that. Even the highest point on the island &#8212; Dun I &#8212; takes about 15 minutes to climb, if you take your time.<br />
It&#8217;s quiet, and it&#8217;s very dark at night &#8212; there are almost no street lights. It&#8217;s so quiet that doors mostly don&#8217;t have locks. The Abbey (technically-speaking) is open all the time.</p>
<h4>Oban</h4>
<p>I heard a few people trash Oban before I went there. But I have to say it&#8217;s a nice little town. It&#8217;s a good base for day trips, and there&#8217;s a lot to see in the area. You could easily stay there a week and not be bored. Given, the hotel we stayed at (Oban Caledonian) had some trouble &#8212; when you have to name the springs in your mattress due to the intimacy you&#8217;re getting with them, it&#8217;s time to replace the mattress. But I&#8217;ve stayed in far, far worse for much more money.</p>
<h4>Train Travel</h4>
<p>I love trains. Duh. You know that. So travelling all over the place on trains is generally not a problem. But I gotta say, someone has to change the rules that puts an end to the drunken football hooligans from spreading out all over the car, singing their songs and disturbing the crap out of everyone else, stinking the place up with their booze, and generally being belligerent. No, asshole, I&#8217;m not student. Unlike you, I have the good sense to travel responsibly, but there&#8217;s not enough luggage racks in the car for my backpack. That doesn&#8217;t give you the right to use it as a pillow or a reason to tell me off. (I also have the good sense to not say anything, since I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re looking for a reason to get into a fight.)</p>
<h4>Inverness</h4>
<p>I also had people tell me not to go to Inverness. Why, I have no idea. It&#8217;s a beautiful little city. The trip there north of Perth is gorgeous, with all the rolling hills. It&#8217;s the highlands there, and it&#8217;s the best way to see it all. Anyway, the city of Inverness is amazing. The River Ness seems almost Disney-esque in the way it cleanly cuts through town, with banks of green grass and the sprouting daffodils. Add to that the lovely old buildings, winding little roads, and the general hospitality of people (drunken football hooligans notwithstanding), you just can&#8217;t go wrong.</p>
<h4>Ramada Inverness</h4>
<p>Except for the Ramada Inverness. For the record, the location is excellent. But overall, I found their staff to be bordering on incompetent. There were a couple of shining stars, no question, but I kept running into people who couldn&#8217;t answer the most basic questions, such as telling me why I can&#8217;t make a long distance phone call. It drove me CRAZY. So sorry, Mom, I couldn&#8217;t call you on your birthday. I tried, really.</p>
<h4>High Tea at the Edinburgh Hilton Caledonian</h4>
<p>Just as good as we had the last time we were there. Outstanding service. Great food. Great tea. Just wish we could have been there longer. Such is life.</p>
<h4>York</h4>
<p>I finally got to spend some actual time in York. The last time we were there barely 5 hours, so didn&#8217;t see much of it. That said, I didn&#8217;t really understand the road map until well into the second day (I kept getting turned around) and even then still took wrong turns. Confusing, but I still love the place. I could easily do month-long stints there to do some photo essays: York at Night, York Minster&#8217;s Hidden Places, Up Close with the National Rail Museum, etc. Love it.</p>
<h4>York to St. Albans without going to London</h4>
<p>Big mistake. Too many switches, we missed a connection, and it&#8217;s too much movement. Going through London is out of the way, but it&#8217;s a lot easier.</p>
<h4>St. Albans</h4>
<p>I still love this little place. The last time, we swore we&#8217;d spend more time there the next time. But we ended up with not even 1 day again, sadly. One day, we will spend more time there. It&#8217;s a very nice place.</p>
<h4>Pictures</h4>
<p>Some are already <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sowrey/tags/scotland2008/">posted on Flickr</a>, and others will come once I get them all done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back at the St. Columba Hotel again &#8212; the only place on the island with an internet connection, it seems &#8212; enjoying my last day here on Iona. The weather over the last few days has improved considerably, even though we had ice pellets again last evening.<br />
The last few days have been marked with a variety of excursions, notably on what they call &#8220;pilgrimages&#8221; (the Community here, although ecumenial, is still devoutly Christian). The pilgrimage route here is so well-known it&#8217;s even published on maps. They tell you that it&#8217;s not a &#8220;hike&#8221; because that would remove all sense of the meaning behind the pilgrimage. It&#8217;s about going to the religiously significant places on the island.<br />
Talk about being the odd man out.<br />
<span id="more-922"></span>Anyway, the experience was good. The weather actually seemed to improve as we went along, even though I found that my supposedly water-resistent shoes are anything but. I ended up having to abort the full route, as the latter half treks through the distinctly boggy part of the island.<br />
Nevertheless, I have officially been to all four shores on this island. It&#8217;s less of a feat than it sounds, since getting to all four shores can be done in a matter of a day without too much effort. The island is very small, and except for the wet parts of the south end of the island, you can pretty much hit all four sides without a great deal of effort.<br />
I also trekked up Dun I (pronounced &#8220;dun-ee&#8221;), which is the tallest point on the island, about 103 metres. I&#8217;m convinced that it&#8217;s not actually a hill of stone, as is much of the island. I think it&#8217;s actually an ancient (and massive) heap of sheep dung from the plentiful flocks that roam the island. The herders have to put it all somewhere, right? I think the farmers have just passed it off as a &#8220;holy mountain&#8221; just to keep the tourists happy.<br />
(Yes, I&#8217;m kidding. If you&#8217;ve read any of this blog, you know enough not to take me seriously.)<br />
Tomorrow, we head back to Oban to overnight again before heading off to Inverness. Not really sure how all that will go, but I&#8217;m looking forward to the trip. I feel like I&#8217;ve been cooped up in the abbey far too long, and I need to see something new. Then it&#8217;s off to York, St. Alban&#8217;s, and home again.<br />
Then I&#8217;m off to San Francisco not even two days later. Oy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;re into Day 2 on our Iona Community experience. Thus far it&#8217;s been &#8230; well, chilly. The weather here is reminiscent of something we tried to leave back home. Only windier with the sea dampness to add to the chill. Walking about is a little hard right now, so I haven&#8217;t been much further than the abbey itself.<br />
I suppose you gotta start somewhere, right?<br />
<span id="more-921"></span>So far, the Wee One has been a joy to travel with. The flight was trivial (compared to what we feared), and by third day had effectively adjusted to the time zone. (I think there might have been a faster change, had it not been for all the travelling on the second day.)<br />
The train trip from London to Glasgow on Virgin was wonderful and exceedingly prompt. We even arrived nine minutes early &#8212; Allen surprised us at the station. I hadn&#8217;t actually expected to see them until Oban. The Glasgow-Oban leg of the trip was very picturesque, although the Wee One was getting pretty darn cranky about the trip at that point and made sure the two-car train knew it.<br />
Oban is a nice place, but didn&#8217;t really get to see much beyond the esplanade and the Tesco. With luck, we might see a bit more of it on the way back. We will see.<br />
The Iona Community is an interesting thing. It operates at the abbey, so we actually become &#8220;residents&#8221; for the week we&#8217;re there. That includes serving food and cleaning. I got the bathroom floors. There&#8217;s also a priority on worship &#8212; I think I&#8217;m going to try hide in the library as much as possible.<br />
We&#8217;re always cold. The Abbey is 14th century, and fibreglass wasn&#8217;t really known at the time. Windows are single pane, and you always hear the wind. (The Library has gaps in shutters right to the outside.) Most everyone wears a jacket all the time. But the food is good and the people are very nice &#8212; they seem to have taken our child as a mascot of sorts, it seems. They rub for good luck. A mini Buddha.<br />
We&#8217;re here until Friday, then off back to Oban then on to Inverness. I hope I get to see more of the island, but the wind has to die down first. I&#8217;m losing ideas in the gusts&#8230;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree with Amy. Moscow is dismal. Even when it&#8217;s sunny, it&#8217;s dismal. There is just no joy or life in this city. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a result of decades of Soviet rule, but I can&#8217;t wait to get out of here. I suppose the plethora of security personnel doesn&#8217;t help, either. &#8230; <a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2005/05/kazan-take-me-away/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Kazan, take me away!"</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wholeheartedly agree with Amy.<br />
Moscow is dismal. Even when it&#8217;s sunny, it&#8217;s dismal. There is just no joy or life in this city. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a result of decades of Soviet rule, but I can&#8217;t wait to get out of here. I suppose the plethora of security personnel doesn&#8217;t help, either.<br />
<span id="more-530"></span>Amy and I escaped to the <a href="http://www.musobl.divo.ru/archit_e.html">monastery at Sergei Posad</a>, a small town about 90 minutes east of Moscow. It was a great chance to escape to something a little more sane. The monastery is an operating one &#8212; and has been that way since it was first founded. Even Stalin didn&#8217;t touch it (and he was famous for destroying churches just for the fun of it).<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03557.JPG" alt="The monastery at Sergei Posad (formerly Zagorsk)" width="300" /></a><br />
It looked almost the same as it had in 1989, though some of the buildings are undergoing renovation/restoration. (Apparently, prayer is more important than keeping a roof over one&#8217;s head.) Unlike many of the other places we&#8217;ve been, though, the only fee at the monastery is to allow you to take photos or use a video camera (a common fee, mind you &#8212; a lot of places have it). A lot of people were there &#8212; a single ruble from each of them would go a long way to ensuring the funding of the monastery.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03558.JPG" alt="Me in front of the monastery at Sergei Posad (formerly Zagorsk)" width="300" /></a><br />
There&#8217;s a McDonald&#8217;s in Sergei Posad, now, about 250 metres from the monastery. There&#8217;s just something wrong about that.<br />
The tourist-only Berioska Shop that was on the outskirts of the plaza is gone, replaced with a series of small stores and a restaurant. The building is ringed by local vendors hawking their local wares (though I suspect a number of them are made in China).<br />
The food, as Amy has pointed out, has generally been quite good. Although Russian cuisine isn&#8217;t quite as &#8220;neat&#8221; as North American. You have to be careful eating chicken &#8212; they don&#8217;t debone it, here. Georgian cuisine is very tasty, although spicy, and a little bit greasy.<br />
We leave in about five hours, and it can&#8217;t go fast enough. I want out of here. I want to get on the road. I want to get past Moscow and into areas I don&#8217;t know. I want to head in the direction of home. Amy and I are homesick (Amy&#8217;s also actually sick, and I really hope I don&#8217;t catch her cold), so the sooner we get moving, the better.<br />
Tomorrow morning, we&#8217;ll be in Kazan. There for the day, then off to Ekaterinburg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a rainy day when my brother Raoul&#8230; no, wait, sorry &#8212; that&#8217;s a Pizzaville ad.<br />
But it was a rainy day here (the rain only recently finally stopped). Amy and I were going to do the church tour today, but walking to the Peter and Paul Fortress would have soaked us through. Not really an option.  Instead, we opted for the <a href="http://www.saint-petersburg.com/virtual-tour/st-isaacs-cathedral.asp">St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral</a>, about a click down the road.<br />
<span id="more-528"></span>The last time I saw St. Isaac&#8217;s, it was still in need of work. It&#8217;s one of the largest and tallest buildings in St. Petersburg, and its golden dome was used by the Nazis for shelling the then Leningrad. The photos of the church&#8217;s history show that by the end of the war, St. Isaac&#8217;s was little more than a jagged shell of its former glory.<br />
In 1989, bullet holes were still present in the outer walls and columns. Much of the interior had been somewhat repaired, but it was a far cry from complete. In 1997, a massive restoration project restored the church back to its pre-WWII beauty.<br />
For 440 rubles, you can scamper up a tall, circular staircase to the colonnade to see the St. Petersburg skyline (it&#8217;s quite breathtaking from up there), visit the museum, and shoot non-professional photos (basically, you&#8217;re not using a tripod). It&#8217;s pricey, but it&#8217;s worth it. The interior of St. Isaac&#8217;s alone is worth it &#8212; I have no idea how much they spent on the work, but the results speak for themselves.<br />
The interior is gorgeous. Allow me to show you a few things. First, the holy interior of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03548.JPG" alt="The holy interior of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy dome of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03549.JPG" alt="The holy dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy altar of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03551.JPG" alt="The holy altar of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy candle room of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03552.JPG" alt="The holy candle room of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
The holy ATM of St. Isaac&#8217;s Cathedral:<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03550.JPG" alt="The holy ATM of St. Isaac's Cathedral" width="300" /></a><br />
(Yeah, that was a little weird to see.)<br />
Amy opted not to climb the colonnade, so finished with the museum (the rest of the church) by the time I got there. We met up afterwards in the Astoria Hotel for tea. Sheerly lethal sweets, I might add (the chocolate mousse was enough to make me cry). A little indulgence for such a wet day.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03553.JPG" alt="Tea at the Astoria Hotel" width="300" /></a><br />
We returned to the hostel for a while before wandering back out to the Palace Square to see what was going on out there. The military have been practicing for a few days for the big celebrations on 9 May (60 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany). They were apparently pretty bad on Wednesday. Not too bad today, though I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t appreciate being in the rain.<br />
<a><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03554.JPG" alt="Military drills in Palace Square" width="300" /></a><br />
We&#8217;re getting ready for our train to Moscow tonight. We leave in about two hours. We can only hope we&#8217;re not trapped in a cabin with vodka-toting Russians. Our new Israeli roommate took all day to recover from his sojourn here yesterday as a result of that&#8230;</p>
