								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mother&#8217;s Day in Costa Rica doth not come in May, like we&#8217;re used to in North America. Here, it&#8217;s 15 August. This is the day (so I&#8217;ve read) that the <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02006b.htm">Virgin Mary ascended to Heaven</a>, and given that this is a very Roman Catholic-centric society, Christian Holy Days are holidays. That means <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%ADa_de_la_madre">El DÃ­ ­a de la Madre</a> takes on extra importance here. Down here, it really is a religion.<br />
Which is good for me, believe it or not. You see, back in May, I royally screwed up and really blew Alex&#8217;s first Mother&#8217;s Day by doing &#8230; well, nothing. At least nothing of note. Not exactly a wise thing to do on a mother&#8217;s first Mother&#8217;s Day. I had some serious <span style="text-decoration: line-through">sucking</span> making up to do.<br />
<span id="more-1035"></span>My plan? Another surprise weekend. And given that it was a long weekend, it was a good chance to go a bit further than before and see something new and interesting. So I started hunting around for interesting places to go. Originally, it was to head out to Arenal &#8212; a place we&#8217;ve both been to and like. But I couldn&#8217;t get a good room.<br />
I stumbled across a beach resort called <a href="http://www.ylangylangresort.com/">Ylang Ylang</a>. Not the nicest website, sadly. (I should offer them services in return for a week&#8217;s stay or something. To take pictures for the website, of course.) But they had two major offerings listed on their website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candlelit dinners</li>
<li>Hammocks &#8220;everywhere&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>The tricky part is getting there. Ylang Ylang is in <a href="http://www.nicoyapeninsula.com/montezuma/">Montezuma</a>, a small remote former fishing village on the Nicoya Peninsula. There are two &#8220;overland&#8221; routes: One that takes you to Puntarenas where you board a ferry to Paquera, and one in a loop over the north end of the Gulf of Nicoya (which is about 5-6 hours longer).<br />
This was the first real test of the Suzuki for distance. By 9:00am, we were packed and hitting the road for Montezuma. Well, almost. We had to stop at MÃ¡s Por Menos for some supplies. While Alex shopped, I had to make a quick return trip home to get the forgotten stroller, which is when I found out that my keycard no longer worked, necessitating a long conversation with the security guard in broken Spanish.<br />
But I digress.<br />
My biggest worry for the trip out was running into another <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/08/u-turns-are-illegal-in-costa-rica/">jerk cop who wanted to give me a hard time</a> for not having any metal license plates on my car. At the moment, I have the official permit that says I can drive my car, but no plates. This is &#8220;normal&#8221; in Costa Rica and you see a couple cars a day like this. The joys of backlogs of paperwork. Still, after my last run-in, I didn&#8217;t want to go through the trouble with a disgruntled infant.<br />
The trip to <a href="http://www.puntarenas.com/puntarenas/">Puntarenas</a> is barely 80 kilometres. But it takes about two hours to drive, thanks largely to the Costa Rican highway system, which is just shy of pathetic. Unlike the countries to the north and south of Costa Rica, the highways here are in perpetually poor state and simply not well-designed. They snake all over the mountains rather than cutting through them (or under them) to alleviate the dangerous hairpin turns and really dangerous nighttime traversals.<br />
On a map, <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.980009,-84.823637&amp;spn=0.04421,0.06712&amp;t=h&amp;z=14">Puntarenas doesn&#8217;t really look that long of a spit of land into the Gulf</a>, but it still took over 20 minutes of driving to finally get to the end, where we found the line for the Paquera ferry. Being a long weekend, it was a long line. We climbed out and were heading up the line to buy a ticket when a very sweaty young man by the name of Marcos (who spoke surprisingly good English) told us to stay with the car.<br />
This is how we found out how the process works:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you arrive for the ferry, you wait for a ferry employee to come to your car and give you a vehicle classification ticket. Our car, for example, was &#8220;Vehiculo Liviando&#8221;, basically a sedan.</li>
<li>You take said ticket to the ferry ticket wicket, where you purchase your boarding. You buy for the car as well as its occupants &#8212; two adults, in this case (kid ride for free!)</li>
<li>You return to your car and drive onto the ferry</li>
</ul>
<p>Marcos was a particularly nice guy. The two of us chatted on the way up the line to the ticket booth, at which point he told me to move the car to a small parking area (it was a rocky dirt lot) and told me to wait for him there. Because he &#8220;liked [our] baby&#8221;, he was going to let us cut into the line to make sure we got on the ferry.<br />
When people say that Ticos are nice, they&#8217;re not kidding. They are nice. Far too nice. They make Canadians look like assholes, they&#8217;re so nice.<br />
The ferry itself looked little more than one of those smaller ferries they use in BC for the short island hops with low traffic: a car deck, with a smaller deck above it for walk-on pedestrians. The ship was deceptively small, and had a &#8220;hidden&#8221; lower deck that cars drove into (through hatches on the main deck). This is where we parked. It&#8217;s dark, dank, stiflingly hot (which isn&#8217;t much of a stretch &#8212; all of Puntarenas is stiflingly hot compared to Santa Ana), and once all the cars are in, cramped. The upper deck is air-conditioned, but you could barely tell.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774939432[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774938298[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774937502[/flickr]<br />
The trip over is about an hour and a quarter. Then it&#8217;s back in your car, and away you go &#8230; to try not get lost. (Remember, Alex didn&#8217;t know where we were going, so I was going off a half-memorised map and some road signs.) And off we went.<br />
The distance from Paquera to Montezuma is about 30-40 kms. Which takes an hour to drive. Like the rest of Costa Rica, the roads are windy, so you can&#8217;t drive quickly. The last 7 kilometres from Cobano to Montezuma are some of the worst roads I&#8217;ve seen outside of Mongolia. The last 500 metres are down a 18% grade unpaved rocky hill with a near-hairpin turn at the bottom.<br />
Fun. Reason #158 we bought a 4&#215;4.<br />
You are rewarded, however. Although Montezuma has probably more hotels than homes, it&#8217;s so quaint that you don&#8217;t even really see the hotels. There are no chains to be seen in Montezuma &#8212; and it&#8217;ll likely be a long, cold day in Hell before that happens.<br />
There are basically three main roads in Montezuma &#8212; the &#8220;highway&#8221; that runs all the way down the coast, one road that runs perpendicularly towards to the only other road in Montezuma, running parallel to the highway for a little over two blocks, connecting the two main parts of Playa Montezuma. The tallest building doesn&#8217;t even come to the height of the trees, and the newest-looking thing is a Coca-Cola sign hanging over one of the stores.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774085179(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774936972(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774934712(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
In other words, a little slice of quaint paradise.<br />
We pulled into <a href="http://www.elbanano.com/elsanobanano.html">El Sano Banano</a>, an odd-named hotel that is the parent owner of Ylang Ylang (the latter being decidedly more upscale, although still insanely less expensive than a comparable place in North America). I ran in to &#8220;check-in&#8221; (you do Ylang Ylang check-in at El Sano Banano), then drove around the back to get to the parking lot. You can&#8217;t drive to Ylang Ylang &#8212; there&#8217;s a shuttle for you. The parking lot has a 24-hour guard.<br />
The shuttle arrived about 30 minutes later. A Land Rover Defender. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Boy, isn&#8217;t that pretentious?&#8221; It&#8217;s not (just) about being pretentious &#8212; it&#8217;s about being functional and appropriate. The drive from El Sano Banano is not far &#8212; only a 10-minute walk, really &#8212; but it&#8217;s over a beach with rocky outcroppings, and carrying bags that far ain&#8217;t easy. An ordinary car wouldn&#8217;t make it, let alone something like a golf cart.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774031253(small)[/flickr]<br />
We soon found something interesting about Ylang Ylang &#8212; unlike virtually every other place that we&#8217;ve been to in Costa Rica so far, almost every single person at Ylang Ylang speaks very good English. And are extremely friendly (moreso than regular Ticos). Our driver (I&#8217;m going to call him &#8220;Carlos&#8221; because I honestly forget his name) constantly tried to make Mi Pequeña Niña giggle (which isn&#8217;t that hard, and is very rewarding &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing like baby laughter).<br />
We arrived with a pair of women who were also from Santa Ana &#8212; teachers from NYU at a satellite school. I think Jason, Mark, and I met their students <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/06/second-weekend-in-costa-rica/">a few weeks ago in Bar Amigo</a> when we were out scouting Santa Ana. They were staying in the room right next to us.<br />
The room, incidentally, was down a 250-metre tiled path through the beach-front forest to a 3-storey, 6-room (the upper rooms are two-storey lofts) building. Ylang Ylang doesn&#8217;t have a lot of available rooms &#8212; maybe 15 in total. You couldn&#8217;t have more than 45 people there at any time, even with triple occupancy in the larger rooms. It&#8217;s a big space, and you don&#8217;t feel even remotely cramped.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774106193(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774954666(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774122541(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
The room had two double beds with mosquito nets above them. It&#8217;s the rainy season right now, which seems to mean that you aren&#8217;t likely see mosquitoes much, actually. And although <a href="http://www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk/destinations/malariamaps/costarica.htm">Costa Rica is in the &#8220;malaria zone&#8221;</a>, Ingrid (one of my co-workers) has lived here most of her life, been all over the country, been bitten by countless mosquitos, and doesn&#8217;t know a person who&#8217;s had malaria.<br />
(That&#8217;s not in any way a defence, more a statement of fact and a lessening of my mother&#8217;s blood pressure that we might be getting a nasty disease here.)<br />
No air conditioning. That part wasn&#8217;t so good. Ylang Ylang is more environmentally-conscious than most places I&#8217;ve been to, and I guess A/C isn&#8217;t one of their preferred items. There were two ceiling fans at least. No glass on the windows (and no screens beyond the shutters) meant a constant fresh-air supply, and some airflow through the room. Also, a very clear (and sometimes loud) serenade of the surf on the adjacent beach.<br />
We ate dinner early the first night &#8212; we had to get food into our child before she had a total meltdown. She ate most of a plate of spaghetti (cutting noodles for children is not easy). I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember what Alex ate. As for me, I had probably the best blackened tuna I have ever eaten in my life. I&#8217;ve had many &#8220;blackened&#8221; meals in my day ever since <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/1996/04/road-trip-southwest-new-orleans/">first sampling one in New Orleans</a>. But never one that good. I&#8217;m sorry, Nawlins, but this chef actually out-did you. I&#8217;m still in awe days later.<br />
Sleep was rough the first night. Too hot (we were getting adjusted to the temperatures on the coast) and the surf was a bit too loud for my liking. Fortunately, the kid slept well. At least until 5:15. That&#8217;s when we had our wake-up call.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774153357(small)[/flickr]<br />
A howler monkey.<br />
Fortunately, I knew what a howler monkey sounded like &#8212; our first trip to Costa Rica back in 2005 featured a little hike around the back of Arenal Volcano, and a howler monkey serenade. Loud buggers. Especially at 5:15, less than 20 metres from your glass-less window. Everyone was up for the day at that point. Going back to sleep simply wasn&#8217;t an option.<br />
Because breakfast wasn&#8217;t served until 7:00 (and we were there pretty much on the dot), there was a signficant amount of distraction needed so Mi Pequeña Niña didn&#8217;t meltdown from lack of food. Fortunately, a beach makes for a great distraction.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774099171(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774097061(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774964112(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774962698(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774971738(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774972240(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
We wandered into Montezuma after the morning nap to get a better look. I wasn&#8217;t really surprised when we realised that we had already seen the entire village when we&#8217;d arrived the day before. Montezuma is small, quaint, and at the time not heavily populated. A lot of English is spoken there, though &#8212; it must attract a lot of North Americans. (I was told later it&#8217;s known by the locals as &#8220;Montefuma&#8221; for all the marijuana smoke &#8212; something that must come out in the high season. High season. Get it? HAH! I kill me&#8230;)<br />
We wandered into a couple of stores, MPN was fawned over by a number of people (it happens a lot) before we went to a small place called Organics for lunch. Think of a nice bistro-style open-air restaurant run by vegans. That&#8217;s pretty much what this place was. Good food, though. Probably the best nachos I&#8217;ve ever had (not cornmeal chips &#8212; something else entirely different), and an amazingly flavourful black bean dip. I tried to feed an avocado sandwich to the Wee One, getting almost as much avocado on me as in her.<br />
By the time we headed back to Ylang Ylang, the tide had come all the way in and pushing the stroller was almost impossible (the hard-packed sand is only available at lower tides). I ended up dragging it most of the way back. I was dripping sweat. It was so hot that an afternoon nap wasn&#8217;t an option &#8212; the blood-curdling screaming was enough of a sign of that.<br />
Hence, a dip in the pool. Although the ocean there is fantastic (the temperature of a nice, warm bath), the surf made going in not an option with MPN. The pool more than sufficed, and three of us swam for close to 45 minutes. The coolness also restored our core body temperatures, allowing the afternoon nap to actually take place.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774116929(small)[/flickr]<br />
Alex rocked in the many hammocks, read one of the Babysitter&#8217;s Club books (she loved &#8217;em as a youth, and loves them still for the quick readability), while I traipsed around in the ocean. On one of my trips back to make sure MPN was still asleep (about two hours all told), a troop of white-faced capuchins were running across the reception building, crossing over to trees and carrying on only as monkeys can.<br />
Fortunately, no poo-throwing.<br />
Curious little buggers, they came right down close to the pool area to see if there was food or anything shiny (they&#8217;re great thieves). One of them came quite close down a palm leaf and gave Alex and I a bit of a scare. You&#8217;re never really sure if one of these things might jump on you, and capuchins aren&#8217;t exactly the cleanest of animals to have jump on you.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774859976(small)[/flickr]<br />
It wouldn&#8217;t be our only run-in with capuchins that day. When the Wee One finally woke, I took her out to the restaurant area to have a snack while Alex got a good back massage (to make up for the el crapo one she got at Punta Leona a couple of weeks ago). One of the capuchins noticed that I was carrying a banana as I walked down the path, babe in arms. It came right down on a branch mere feet away. I shooed it and made a break for the restaurant, just in case it got grabby.<br />
Well, be darned if it didn&#8217;t race back up that tree to see where I was going, then run from tree-top to tree-top following us, across the restaurant&#8217;s roof and climbed down one of the supports to wait for us. Darn sneaking things. Cute, yes, but a little needy. I shooed it away again.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774164871(small)[/flickr]<br />
The restaurant staff, of course, saw all this and laughed. The capuchins play here a lot, and people encourage it, so things are a little less-natural than perhaps they should be. Monkeys ain&#8217;t stupid, though &#8212; people are. One of the restaurant staff even demonstrated the capuchins&#8217; desire for bananas for us (there was also another family with young kids from LA), by taking an older banana (quite brown) and coaxing one such monkey from a nearby palm tree.<br />
It almost came out for the entire banana, but the kids shrieked and scared the monkey. Broken in half and given in two portions tossed out on the grass, the monkey was a little more brave.<br />
[flickr]photo:2775144806(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774282729(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
Dinner was again fantastic. While Mi Pequeña Niña downed most of a very tasty quesadilla, I went through a wonderful Thai-style teriyaki tuna. (I&#8217;m struggling to remember what Alex had. I think my food thoroughly distracts me. I know she had chicken, but I&#8217;m darned to remember what exactly.)<br />
Just as we put the Wee One to sleep, it started to rain. Little did we know, but a storm was rolling in across the country. It rained all night. Heavily. No night photography for me in Montezuma &#8212; I&#8217;ll just have to go back! The rain pounded through all the trees, even drowning out the nearby surf.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774874214(small)[/flickr]<br />
The storm was pretty big, and the next morning the damage was clear &#8212; about 1/5th of the sand on the beach had been washed out. (Carlos would later explain that this is normal, and happens in September and October every year.)<br />
[flickr]photo:2774935368(thumbnail)[/flickr] [flickr]photo:2774092431(thumbnail)[/flickr]<br />
At 9:00, the Defender took us back to El Sano Banano, where we loaded up the Suzuki for the ride home. Alex stopped in the store to pick up some supplies (baby food, &#8220;just in case&#8221;), and some postcards. A couple last pictures, and we headed back up the even-more-treacherous hill. Thankfully, we have a 4&#215;4 &#8212; going up in anything else wouldn&#8217;t be so easy, I think. The road back was quite muddy.<br />
[flickr]photo:2774520851(small)[/flickr]<br />
Having no idea what time the ferry actually left from Paquera, there was the possibility of us missing it. As cars started to whip past us quite quickly, I began to think that maybe they were racing for the ferry, too. But driving quickly in what was turning into another torrential downpour didn&#8217;t strike me as a good idea &#8212; straight roads here are a rarity.<br />
We got to the ferry line after loading had started. Alex stayed with the car while I raced off to get a ticket. The line was vastly unorganised and excruciatingly slow, and I had some lady behind me who constantly kept bumping into me &#8212; a pickpocket&#8217;s technique &#8212; though nothing was lifted (I keep my rear pockets devoid of anything). I managed to get the tickets to Alex just as she arrived at the front of the line to drive on. I slapped the tickets into the ticket-collector&#8217;s hands, but instead of getting back in the car, he directed me to walk on &#8212; the long way. I had to run to catch up with Alex on the main deck.<br />
It rained part of the trip back. But Puntarenas was sunny and warm. Originally thinking we might stop there for lunch, we opted to hit the road and find something along the way. At Esparza, I pulled off at a roadside diner-like establishment that seemed to be a major stopping point for buses. We both opted for a casado con pollo (a typical Tico dish with rice, beans, shredded cabbage or lettuce, and chicken), feeding some of it to Mi Pequeña Niña.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it was all the buses that were stopping, or if it was Esparza, or my own imagination, but I began to get a little nervous about our car. People were getting too close to it. One jerk even cuddled up to it, looking like he might try to rip off the antenna.<br />
There&#8217;s a problem in Costa Rica, mostly with rental vehicles. People puncture holes in the tires, then follow you until you pull over because of the flat. They offer to help you, and steal all your luggage. I don&#8217;t know how common this is, but most of the travel books and rental agencies warn you about it. (Avis&#8217;s insurance won&#8217;t cover the tires, no matter how much you get.) We ended up racing through the end of our meal to get back to our new car before something bad happened.<br />
Turned out it was just that the guy was a jerk.<br />
Not long after we left Esparza, the rain hit again. It was raining pretty much everywhere on Sunday, and heavily. Even for the rainy season, it was a lot. All the way over the mountains, it poured. Even creeks were racing with all the water. A tractor-trailer with a short container load even flipped on one of the many hairpin curves. A sure sign that the driving should be done with due care.<br />
We stopped only once on our way back, when Alex spotted wooden toys for sale at the side of the road. I&#8217;d spotted little trucks, but she&#8217;d seen the rocking horses. After a short double-back, we picked one of them up. It&#8217;s Mi Pequeña Niña&#8217;s first birthday on Friday, and we wanted to get her something nice. I think it was a great idea.<br />
Once we got past Grecia, the trip was pretty easily. I&#8217;ve done that part of the Panamerican so much that I almost have it memorised. We stopped at the Auto Mercado for groceries (running into Jason and Jen, and raving about Ylang Ylang to them) before heading home. I&#8217;ve lost faith in Auto Mercado, as their produce is beyond sketchy (a bunch of bad bananas and a bad mango all in one shot?). MÃ¡s Por Menos seems to be better, and Fresh Market is usually the best (and most expensive).<br />
Home in the rain, and it rained all night. The Lago even flooded yesterday at the complex, and they were fixing the overflow drain this morning.<br />
The next adventure? Don&#8217;t know yet. Maybe a return to Arenal, maybe a flight out to Tortuguero (the drive is not easy or short), maybe just little trips around the area. We&#8217;ll see.<br />
But stay tuned&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had promised Alex that the second weekend we were in Costa Rica would be spent away from our apartment. I just had to find the right place to go. So I spent a fair bit of time working out the location, time to get to the location (because any estimates of travel time here are usually way off once you leave the #1), cost, and whether or not they had massages.<br />
Yes, that is a consideration in her (and hence my) world.<br />
In the end, I decided on Punta Leona. This would be our first surprise weekend in Costa Rica, and it would seem the first surprise weekend in &#8212; we fear &#8212; two years! Turned out to be not too bad.<br />
<span id="more-1026"></span>I ducked out of work a couple of hours early on Friday. I knew the trip was going to be about two hours, and I also knew the traffic going through Lindora (where our current office is) tends to be pretty evil towards the end of the day. I zipped home, packed up the remaining parts that weren&#8217;t already packed, and the three of us took to the road.<br />
Getting to the highway &#8212; the Panamerican highway #1 &#8212; takes about 30 minutes from where we are in traffic. It&#8217;s far from a straight route. Once we got to the highway, we still had to contend with a bit of traffic between where we got on (near CervecerÃƒ ­a Costa Rica S.A. &#8212; CCR, which makes Imperial beer) and the airport (there&#8217;s a traffic light) and a couple of areas where the highway narrows to a single lane as you head west.<br />
By this point, Alex was already well into the game of rhyming off places that we could go. Normally, when we did this back in Canada, she was much better at it. But Alex isn&#8217;t attuned to Costa Rican geography yet (nor am I, for the record), so the game wasn&#8217;t as lively as usual.<br />
We drove until we got to Highway 3, which heads to Atenas. This is the &#8220;fastest&#8221; route to Jaco, which is the destination often used to help guide people.<br />
If you look on the map, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=+Costa+Rica&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=9.841686,-84.460831&amp;spn=0.372773,0.478592&amp;z=11">the road from the junction of the #1 and the #3 all the way down to Punta Leona</a> looks reasonably nice. A little curvy in a few places, but overall nice. It&#8217;s about as misleading as a cigarette salesman. The road is 74 kilometres, packed into a straight-line distance of about 50 kilometres. That&#8217;s how much it weaves. The curves are tight, the valleys are deep, having a manual transmission is a God-send, and all the little one-lane bridges slow you down.<br />
The information to find Punta Leona suggested (look for the sign, you can&#8217;t miss it). Well, folks, at dusk it&#8217;s pretty darn easy to miss the sign. It was almost dark by the time we got there (in just over two hours, I should add), and the massive PUNTA LEONA sign isn&#8217;t lit at that point. It&#8217;s not a town &#8212; it&#8217;s a resort.<br />
This threw me a little. I thought Punta Leona was a town, and the hotel was a resort in the town. Nope. It&#8217;s its own little world. Security is high (you need to have a reservation or invitation to come in after 5pm), and it&#8217;s isolated. The drive from the front gate on the highway all the way down to the hotel area is 15 minutes through bamboo forests and the jungle.<br />
Yes, jungle.<br />
Punta Leona is built into a rainforest. It&#8217;s one of the neatest things I&#8217;ve yet seen for a hotel. It&#8217;s a resort &#8212; a timeshare, so far as I can tell &#8212; and the construction puts it very close to two beaches: Playa Mantas and Playa Blanca. Technically, you can&#8217;t own a beach in Costa Rica (that&#8217;s what I understand), so Punta Leona still has to provide access to the beaches &#8212; they&#8217;re public property.<br />
Mi Pequeña Niña was beyond hungry. Over two hours in a car was more than enough for her, and she wanted out. Alex had to get into the back seat for the last 1/3 of the trip to try and keep the wee one happy. By the time we&#8217;d turned off the highway and were driving down the 15 minutes of road, it was just &#8220;GET ME OUTTA HERE&#8221;.<br />
Jungle everywhere, but almost impossible to see. It was dark, and in the jungle, it gets dark quickly. We checked in, got our key and tried to go directly to dinner. But the restaurant doesn&#8217;t open until 19:00, so we opted to put everything in the room first. By the time we were done, the restaurant was open. I think we were the first to arrive.<br />
The next morning, we finally got a good look at our little slice of heaven. We stayed in the Selvamor suites, which are little huts amidst the giant rainforest trees. After a bite of breakfast and a nap (for the baby, not us), we wandered down to the pool area for a morning of splashing around.<br />
I should note that this is the baby splashing around, not us. She doesn&#8217;t know how to swim yet, and isn&#8217;t in water wings just yet. So she needs us to keep her head above water.<br />
We returned to the buffet for lunch, as we didn&#8217;t really have anything for Mi Pequeña Niña to eat. The afternoon was much slower, with another nap, and some wandering around for Alex and I. (Yes, we leave our child in the room to sleep alone. The door is locked, and we&#8217;re very confident in the way she sleeps.) We ended up being caught in a tropical downpour.<br />
Before dinner, we drove out to Playa Blanca (walking there would have taken well over an hour) to watch the sunset. Sadly, the weather was against us and there was no sun to be seen. It would appear we have to wait a while longer before we can see another fantastic Costa Rican sunset again. It won&#8217;t be long, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
At dinner, we met a rather interesting couple from &#8212; of all places &#8212; Calgary, who were on their 12th time visiting Costa Rica. Mi Pequeña Niña, as with every meal it seems, attracted attention from virtually every restaurant staff and from most of the nearby tables. There&#8217;s something about a blonde-haired, blue-eyed baby that doesn&#8217;t stop smiling that seems to get people happy.<br />
Punta Leona, as I&#8217;ve already said, is surrounded by jungle. This includes all the jungle creatures that live there, including leaf-cutter ants, a couple kinds of raccoons (one of which looks like a slightly longer version of the one we&#8217;re most familiar with back in Canada), all sorts of birds, squirrels, and supposedly monkeys (but we didn&#8217;t see or hear any).<br />
It&#8217;s also filled with stupid tourists who feed those animals human food. That bothered me a lot. I hate it when it happens in Canada, and there&#8217;s stiff penalties for doing it. Here? Well, it&#8217;s a blind-eye situation.<br />
Following breakfast the next morning, I zipped back out to Playa Blanca to get some pictures in the daylight, while Alex and the Wee One went to the playground. Then the three of us began a much slower drive home.<br />
The route back was oddly harder than the route out. Some of the road signs aren&#8217;t particularly clear, and twice I had to turn around to re-join the right road. Alex caught me the first and third times, I caught myself the second. I&#8217;m sure with more practise at driving here, I&#8217;ll be able to read the signs a little more easily.<br />
We stopped twice. Once at this place called Mirador Something-Or-Other, which is almost at the border of Atenas and San Mateo along a windy strip of road that makes the Trans Canada between Field and Golden look like a straight, flat line. The view was spectacular &#8230; and the service exactly the opposite. We had something to drink and left.<br />
The second place was in an area with a number of small restaurants in Atenas. Alex chose one place that was as typÃƒ ­co as food gets in Costa Rica, but with a menu that featured English so we knew what we were eating. Mi Pequeña Niña ate a significant portion of my arroz con pollo (rice with chicken) and most of my steamed vegetables. She rather liked the rice, and couldn&#8217;t get enough. Noted, for future meals!<br />
Arriving at home, I started to feel that it was &#8230; home. I&#8217;m almost living here (the work visa is the only thing preventing me from saying that I am living here), and our apartment is starting to feel like home. This is good. &#8216;Cuz it&#8217;s gonna be a long couple years if I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;ve got a home to go to.<br />
