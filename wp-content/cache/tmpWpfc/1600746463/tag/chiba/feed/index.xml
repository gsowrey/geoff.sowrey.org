										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we&#8217;ve moved along over this journey, I&#8217;ve taken pictures of things for posting to the blog. Some of them didn&#8217;t make it, for one reason or another. But hating to waste good pictures, I thought I&#8217;d throw them into a blog posting for all to experience.<br />
<span id="more-587"></span>The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03526.JPG" alt="The engine of my plane as I fly down to San Francisco" width="300" /></a><br />
Our British Airways 747 to London:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03527.JPG" alt="Our British Airways 747 to London" width="300" /></a><br />
The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London (mother and daughter, quite friendly):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03533.JPG" alt="The women who decided to talk us up at the hotel in London" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy and Nick (and me, but I took the picture) sit in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg. Russia has surprisingly good sushi for a country that seems to have very few Japanese:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03543.JPG" alt="Amy and Nick in a sushi restaurant in St. Petersburg" width="300" /></a><br />
Siberia doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features. It generally looks like either of the following two pictures. Usually more the former than the latter:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03565.JPG" alt="Endless stands of birch trees" width="300" /></a><br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03567.JPG" alt="A small, nameless Siberian village" width="300" /></a><br />
And periodically, you do see other trains:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03569.JPG" alt="Passing a freight train" width="300" /></a><br />
The forests often get thicker, too:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03573.JPG" alt="Endless stands of trees" width="300" /></a><br />
Another shot of the Museum of Wooden Buildings. Didn&#8217;t post this as I took too many pictures there (was unsure of lighting, etc.):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03583.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
This is a far, far better shot of the Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude, Russia. I think I chose the other one because it did look better &#8230; at least at the time:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03588.JPG" alt="Mongolian Embassy in Ulan Ude" width="300" /></a><br />
Me at the lake in Mongolia. Wouldn&#8217;t want to go swimming in that, though. Probably not the &#8220;cleanest&#8221; of places, with all the waterfowl and horses:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03600.JPG" alt="Chillin' at the lake" width="300" /></a><br />
Amy catches up on journal- and postcard-writing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03609.JPG" alt="Writing in the ger" width="300" /></a><br />
We caught a sunset at Hustai National Park. This was before I nearly froze to death:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03612.JPG" alt="Sunset at Hustai National Park" width="300" /></a><br />
A line of rail car bogies sit to one side in the bogie-changing shed in Erlian, China:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03616.JPG" alt="Bogies waiting for a new train" width="300" /></a><br />
Most of you are probably wondering what the toilets in the trains looked like. Here&#8217;s an example of the &#8220;western&#8221; toilets. Never did take one of the squat ones, sadly&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03622.JPG" alt="Trail toilet" width="300" /></a><br />
On the road, especially for this length of time, you periodically have to do laundry. Normally, not an issue. But this is what it looks like after washing out all the sand from Mongolia:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03627.JPG" alt="Down Main Street, USSR, er, Russia" width="300" /></a><br />
We hit a great little restaurant in Beijing for lunch one day, and were served a pot of tea. Make with chrysanthemums. Not exactly normal, but quite tasty:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03640.JPG" alt="Chrysanthemum tea" width="300" /></a><br />
Don&#8217;t ask me what kind of store this is. With a name like that, who really cares, anyway?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03644.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
This is the view from our hotel in Shanghai. As you can see, it was quite hazy there. The humidity was murder:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03661.JPG" alt="View from our hotel in Shanghai" width="300" /></a><br />
It rained a lot in Xian on our first day there. Nice, but wet:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03662.JPG" alt="Bell Tower in the rain" width="300" /></a><br />
Who doesn&#8217;t want to go to a Yummy Restaurant?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03663.JPG" alt="Yummy Restaurant" width="300" /></a><br />
We walked around part of Xian&#8217;s walls one night. They looked pretty nice:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03664.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
Our last meal in Xian was at a strange hotpot restaurant, where we had to get someone to translate the freaking menu for us because we couldn&#8217;t read it at all. It was pretty tasty, though:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03669.JPG" alt="Valued Squirrel" width="300" /></a><br />
We made a mistake of going to the &#8220;Entertainers&#8221;, a trio who perform in the lounge of the same name at the Hyatt in Xian. They forever butchered many of my favourite songs&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03671.JPG" alt="Be afraid ... very afraid" width="300" /></a><br />
I meant to post about this. I mean, really, who names their water: &#8220;WAHAHA&#8221;?<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03672.JPG" alt="WAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA" width="300" /></a><br />
At least you can&#8217;t miss the sign to get you to Kowloon (Hong Kong):<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03674.JPG" alt="Get on the train!" width="300" /></a><br />
Chinglish isn&#8217;t escapable, even at the Chinese/Hong Kong SAR border crossing:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03675.JPG" alt="No Flowing Back" width="300" /></a><br />
One of these is the actual border between China and Hong Kong SAR. I have no idea where the heck it is, as it&#8217;s no longer marked:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03677.JPG" alt="Somewhere around the Hong Kong border" width="300" /></a><br />

Rogue vendors are so bad in some areas that private property owners try to keep them out with signs like these:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03692.JPG" alt="No Hawking" width="300" /></a><br />
Ferry traffic!<br />

Our hotel in Kowloon was next to the Avenue of Stars, sort of like the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I found a few names I know:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03703.JPG" alt="Avenue of Stars in Kowloon" width="300" /></a><br />

Jackie Chan apparently heavily sponsors California Fitness. He&#8217;s probably an owner.<br />

Inside our favourite dim sum restaurant in Hong Kong:<br />

We had this at a sushi restaurant in Chiba. We thought it was some weird pickled eel. It was eggplant:<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogetlost.com/2005/06/30/things-seen-along-the-way/"><img src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03741.JPG" alt="It was still tasty" width="300" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tokyo is a wonderful city. Even in the rain. Despite a delayed start (we were up late &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t help that Chris and I yak a lot), we soon found ourselves in Ginza, walking through the mist-like rain in search of not much except yarn (Amy&#8217;s got a project she&#8217;s trying to finish).<br />
We went through the sweet electronic sanctity of the Sony Showroom [insert drool marks on the screen here], then over to the Apple store (four floors of pure industrial design nirvana), before crossing Ginza dori in search of, well, food. Amy spied a small sign that led us down an alley barely wide enough for us to walk, then down a set of barely-marked stairs into a basement restaurant that served some darn fine raumen, and some pretty funky dumplings.<br />
<span id="more-582"></span>Next to that was a paper store. I think Amy&#8217;s heart raced pretty much the whole time she was in there from the paper overload. Too much to choose from, and we&#8217;re almost out of money.<br />
Matsuya and Mitsukoshi (two massive Japanese department stores) were next. But the illusive yarn Amy needs was not to be found. So we went to the food floors in Mitsukoshi to see what samples we could find. There was quite a lot.<br />
We caught a subway over to Akehabara. This is geek heaven when it comes to all things &#8220;batteries not included&#8221;. [Insert more drool marks on the screen here.] Then it was over to Shibuya. The only real things to see there, aside from Shibuya itself, was the HMV, where I hoped to snag some of the music my cousin Jen had asked me to find. I found the artists, but sadly, all sold out. (Go figure.) Sorry, Jen, I&#8217;ll have to keep looking.<br />
We were late meeting up with Chris and his friends Jessica and Alex for a late dinner in Chiba. They didn&#8217;t mind at all. Shinichiro was out again (he&#8217;d come out last night, too) as was another of Chris&#8217; japanese friends (whose name I don&#8217;t want to screw up by spelling incorrectly).<br />
We&#8217;ll be off for Nara before too long. Then Osaka, then home.<br />
Three more sleeps!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why had I gone to Shinagawa to kill time? Simply put, it was far enough away from Tsukiji that walking alone would eat up some time, but not so far that I would be exhausted by the time I got to my destination. I had originally thought Shibuya, but a quick glance at a map ruled it out immediately.<br />
To add to my time getting to Tsukiji, I also planned to walk to Tokyo Tower for some night photographs. Beyond that, I was making up everything as I went. That wasn&#8217;t too hard, considering I didn&#8217;t really know where I was going. I wasn&#8217;t looking at a map, I was just using my sense of direction (usually very reliable) and certain landmarks to know where I was.<br />
<span id="more-347"></span>It&#8217;s almost creepy to think that I&#8217;ve been in Tokyo long enough (this year and last) that I know actual landmarks.<br />
The streets of downtown Tokyo are rather interesting at night. Despite what movies have shown, the majority of Tokyo is quiet. Areas such as Shibuya will be raucous most of the night, but areas like the one I was walking through are surprisingly desolate. Aside from bursts of traffic, 24 hour convenience stores, drunk people either stumbling down the road or urinating in planters, and the odd bicyclist, the streets are very serene. There is a strange, almost zen-like quality about Tokyo at night.<br />
I found Tokyo Tower rather easily. (I stopped along the way only once, at a 7-11 to get a Coke and a salmon onigiri to keep my energy up.) Not by looking at a map, but because it&#8217;s very easy to see at a distance. The lights stay on all night, so make for an ideal photography subject. I know this because I wasn&#8217;t the only one taking pictures of it. It&#8217;s wonderful to observe not only at a distance but also close-up. It would be even nicer to go directly underneath, as you can with the Eiffel Tower (which Tokyo Tower is modelled after), but someone decided to put a rather large building right underneath the tower, ruining a chance of that.<br />
Leaving three drunk Japanese men taking strange photos of themselves in front of the tower with a keitai, I continued my walk to Tsukiji.<br />
Quite poorly, I might add.<br />
Not really thinking about which direction I&#8217;d been going in (I cut through Shibya Park, pausing to take photos at the shrine in the dark), I ended up accidentally doubling back on part of my route. I cursed myself when I realized that I&#8217;d done. But at least I&#8217;d still had a good walk and used more time.<br />
I found my way back to the World Trade Center Building, and continued down to Hama-Rikyu Gardens, which is wedged between Hammamatsucho and Tsukiji. I walked along the north side of Hama-Rikyu, trying to avoid the plethora of construction that seemed to run every few hundred metres. I can only assume Tokyo runs their road construction crews at night as not to interfere with traffic during the day.<br />
Construction crews in Tokyo, and probably over the parts of Japan that we saw, are models of people-use. There are always two to three people (almost always men &#8212; I only ever saw one woman on the crews) who direct pedestrians. One at either end of the construction zone, and one in the middle, if the zone is quite long. There&#8217;s usually at least one foreman, and a number of workers, depending on what&#8217;s happening. All wear safety vests (those near vehicular traffic have vests with blinking lights) and hardhats.<br />
The roads leading into Tsukiji were already lined with trucks, delivering produce, waiting to pick up produce, or in the process of being loaded. (The market is so busy and overloaded that the roads immediately next to the market are filled with loading equipment in the wee hours of the morning.)<br />
Inside the market, the level of activity was far beyond anything I&#8217;d ever expected. Beehives aren&#8217;t this busy. Forklifts carry large flats of crates, smaller three-wheeled carts whizz around (often haphazardly) with all manners of cargo. I really had to watch where I was going as not to be hit by anything.<br />
That&#8217;s the first rule when visiting Tsukiji market: Your presence is tolerated, though not necessarily welcome. Reality: This is a place of business, no different than your office building or construction site. These people aren&#8217;t a Disney show, this is the real thing. If you go there, you stay out of their way. Those who bring Tsukiji to life do not have the time for mindless tourists who want to get in the way because they are tourists. Imagine if they got in the way of you trying to do your job&#8230;<br />
Despite the activity, the market was only just starting to come to life. Most of the vendors hadn&#8217;t yet arrived, and the buyers would be behind them. Already, however, tuna was beginning to be laid out for the auction. The frozen tuna, each weighing a couple hundred pounds or more, were dumped unceremoniously on the floor, almost as one would dump a cord of wood. Frozen completely stiff, you had to look hard to realize that this was fish, and no something else.<br />
The pre-packaged area was already well underway, the massive stacks of styrofoam containers being arranged and rearranged, full of almost every conceivable (and edible) seafood, ready to be sent to stores for sale. These were mostly uninteresting to me. I was more for the tuna auction, and the live (or recently alive, but not processed) produce.<br />
I wandered around until almost 4:00, at which point the sheer insanity of the whizzing carts and constant dodging of people finally sent me out of the market in search of a bit of rest. A nearby Lawson&#8217;s provided a quick snack and a Coke for a much-needed caffeine burst.<br />
In the scant half-hour that I was gone, most of the fishmongers had arrived and were in operation. Live fish were being sorted and crated, cut and filleted, and packaged for shipping. Ice vendors were chewing up huge blocks (at nearly CDN$27 per block, from what I could tell), and the fresh tuna was laid out for inspection. Also arrived were tourists, bussed in for the auction.<br />
I felt oddly superior. I had been there since earlier that morning, had stayed up late so I could experience this. The rest came with tour groups. Most blatantly ignored the signs that forebade entry into the auction warehouses without permission (it was quite easy to see through the door).<br />
On the auction floor, the fish had been prepared for inspection. The frozen tuna had portions cut open so buyers could inspect for quality. The fresh tuna had slices cut off the end for inspection, and the tails (previously cut off, but kept) were available to check the quality of the meet.<br />
Inside the massive rooms were hundreds of people: buyers, sellers, and what I can only assume were the officials that kept the whole thing running. Buyers were easy to spot &#8212; they wear hats with blue cards that denote who they are buying for. I don&#8217;t believe the tuna purchased at Tsukiji is destined for canning, I think most is destined for processing of some kind &#8212; especially the fresh tuna (much of that is bought for sushi restaurants). Admittedly, though, I&#8217;m not really sure where it all goes. Other than it goes very quickly.<br />
The auctions begin at 5:20 in almost all the four warehouses (three frozen, one fresh). Tuna is on the ground floor, and I gather other kinds are bought and sold in rooms above. The tuna auctions are fast. One of the sellers rings a bell (most sellers have a unique bell ring) that signifies selling is about to being. Those buyers wishing to engage in the sale all come over, and the fish are sold individually, and very rapidly. A single sale might take five seconds or less. Larger fish fetch high prices (one massive beast was hungrily viewed by five or six business men, dressed in their finest).<br />
Unfortunately, tourists here tend to get in the way. Once sales are complete, carts immediately appear to whisk the tuna away. (Frozen tuna is often carted to one of the fishmonger stalls, many of which are equipped with bandsaws for the sole purpose of cutting up tuna.) One particular putz was oblivious to the work going on around him, while talking on this cellphone. I wanted to go over and smack him, because one of the fishmongers was almost yelling at him to get out of the way.<br />
Putz.<br />
Auctions over, I wandered around the market, now in full swing. Fish of almost every variety was in sight, much of it still alive. I watched in amazement, becaue I knew that all of it would be gone within six hours. That kind of efficiency in a place so small is unknown in North America. Tsukiji is huge, make no mistake, but it could easily be twice the size to handle all the needs. That&#8217;s what fascinates me so much about it &#8212; unique in the world for the role it fulfills, and few people ever really think about what it does for life in Japan.<br />
I found my way to the sushi restaurant Chris and I had gone to last year (see [[My Trip to Japan, Tsukiji Fish Market]]) for a bit of breakfast. Although you can get good sushi no matter where you are in Tsukiji (including a couple of 24 hour sushi sens in the Outer Market), this particular place I rather liked. Not only were the staff very kind and pleasant, I really liked the green tea and especially the miso soup.<br />
And not knowing Japanese isn&#8217;t a problem. They know enough English to offer you a set (definitely the best way to get it), and tell you the price. (They&#8217;ll also tell you which pieces don&#8217;t need soy sauce.) Although small for what I&#8217;ve been known to eat for sushi, it was exactly what I needed to have for a meal.<br />
With that, I bade Tsukiji farewell, and headed towards Tokyo station. It was still early, so I wasn&#8217;t going to head back to Yotsukaido right away. First, I thought I&#8217;d kill some time at the Imperial Palace, specifically the East Gardens.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t planned to go to the main gate with the double-bridge. But the light from the rising sun and the relative clarity of the skies (Japan seems to be hugged with perpetual smog, no matter where you go), that I couldn&#8217;t pass up a few photos of things I had taken pictures of last year.<br />
As I wandered around to the gate for the East Gardens, I realized that it was Friday. The Gardens, sadly, are closed on Mondays and Fridays, meaning that I would have to wait until the next time I come to Japan to see them. One day, perhaps.<br />
With that, I returned to the station and boarded a train for Chiba. I fell asleep even before the train had left the underground portion of the line. Switching to a local train in Chiba, I almost didn&#8217;t wake up in time for Yotsukaido. I didn&#8217;t take a bus back to the apartment, deciding to save some yen and walk the way back. It gave me my third wind.<br />
Chris was awake when I got to the apartment. We talked a bit about the things I&#8217;d seen and done. Kaz soon came out and the three of us chatted. Kaz made rice and miso soup for breakfast. I could hardly pass up the chance to eat a little more. The activity of the day so far had taken a lot out o me. Finally, Jen woke up and proceeded to shower. Chris tortured me with a taped episode of the live-action Sailor Moon TV show. It you thought the animated version was bad, check out the live action one.<br />
I pray it never comes to North America.<br />
Shortly afterwards, I went to bed. It was just after noon, and I really needed some sleep. I set my alarm and dropped off&#8230;<br />
&#8230;awaking to a loud clatter of doors, bags, and voices. At first, I had no idea where I was. For a brief moment, I wasn&#8217;t even sure who *I* was. But it came back very quickly, like a wave rolling onto the shore. Jen and Kaz were returning from what sounded like shopping. But it was already dark outside &#8230; I&#8217;d only planned to sleep for a couple of hours.<br />
I&#8217;d slept for over five.<br />
We were going to Chiba that night, to dinner with friends. I showered to prepare. I told Kaz to tell Chris we&#8217;d meet him at the station for 20:00 (you have to do that with him). We caught a bus, met up with Chris, and the four of us headed to Chiba.<br />
Shinichiro had called ahead and reserved a table for six at the couches upstairs. Although a bit warm up there, it was more comfortable for eating and chatting. We were quite early, though, and would have to wait for Shinichiro and Riku to arrive. That gave us time to order some drinks, have an appetizer or two, and chat.<br />
Soon, all six of us had assembled, and we were in full chatting and eating modes. Laughter, jokes, and a few English and Japanese lessons flew around. Naome joined us about an hour later, and the seven of us cajoled until well after midnight.<br />
I had only barely known Shinichiro before Chris&#8217; wedding, having met him the first night I was in Japan (see [[My Trip to Japan, Calgary to Yotsukaido]]). Now, he was a friend, as much as Kaz or Naome had become. People I would be more than happen to open my home to, should they decide to ever visit Canada. I will miss them.<br />
We returned by taxi, and I went right to bed. Long nap or not, I needed rest.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We woke up several times this morning. Once when the phone rang (Mike and Brenda checking in on us), when Kaz and Chris&#8217; new refrigerator showed up, when the phone rang a second time, and when the earthquake hit.<br />
And this time, I&#8217;m not joking.<br />
<span id="more-342"></span>It was a light one, maybe only a 3 on the Richter scale, but enough that the building swayed (I&#8217;ll assume for the moment that they&#8217;re designed to do that). For a moment, I wasn&#8217;t sure what was happening. Then I rolled over and went back to bed.<br />
Small earthquakes here are common. Chris doesn&#8217;t even bother to tell us about them anymore. This was the first earthquake I was actually awake for that I could feel. When I lived in Vancouver, we supposedly had one or two, but I never felt one. When I worked at Black&#8217;s Camera back in high school, one hit Oakville. It was very deep and nothing really shook. Instead, it just sounded like there was a garbage truck parked right next to the store (which was impossible, since there was a store next to ours &#8212; I found out later that it had been an earthquake).<br />
Pretty much everyone slept in. This was going to be a long day, so sleep was on the order. Chris and Kaz were up early for the arrival of the fridge, but Tony would remain comatose until well after 10:30. That would be about when the household started to rise and move forward with the day.<br />
Chris shaved (mostly his head) while Kaz and I took turns showering.(The bathroom space allows for a shower and a shave independently, but only if the showerer and the shaver can handle being that close to each other). Jen had to wait until Chris and Kaz were ready to head out the door to Chiba.<br />
They had to leave early for preparations of some sort. Jen and I would head over later, around 17:30. Until that time, Jen played video games, and I read.<br />
The day was cold and miserable, and waiting for the bus to take us to the station was not a particularly enjoyable experience. Luckily, we both had umbrellas, and I had brought a pair of gloves for just such an emergency. We wouldn&#8217;t go directly to the train, however, since we needed to do a bit of laundry at Chris&#8217; old apartment first (the new apartment doesn&#8217;t have a washing machine yet).<br />
On the walk over, the phone rang. It was Chris. They had forgotten a guest book at the apartment for people to sign their names in. It was something that had been used at one of the previous parties, which I had never seen or used before. They wanted it for the party there, and asked that I go back for it.<br />
Dropping the laundry off, we returned to the station. Jen waited (and ate cake) while I hopped in a taxi and handed the keitai to the driver so Chris could give him instructions. Despite my near non-existant Japanese and his near non-existant English, we seemed to have a fairly interesting conversation, though I have no idea about what specifically. Returning to the station, Jen and I headed to Chiba.<br />
Despite not having been there for almost a year, I knew where the bar was. For a while, I almost doubted my memory and thought I might have to call Chris for directions. But before I knew it, the glowing breasts of the bar&#8217;s namesake (and no, I&#8217;m not kidding) appeared. It was then I suddenly remembered some of decor. Fortunately, someone had the smarts to remove all the decorations that wouldn&#8217;t be particularly appropriate for some.<br />
Unlike the party in Toyohashi, most of the people spoke English, which made our mingling a lot easier. The fact that I also knew more people here also helped. Scott was at the door the moment we walked in, as was his girlfriend, Miyuki. The last time I&#8217;d seen them was when we&#8217;d left Club Mix after a full night of bar-hopping last year (see [[My Trip to Japan, Tokyo and Shibuya]]). I don&#8217;t know if Miyuki remembered me, but Scott did.<br />
Shinichiro was taking pictures of everyone as they arrived. People would later sign the photos and give them to Chris and Kaz (although some didn&#8217;t make it into their hands, one of which was Tony in his monkey suit). Shinichiro and Scott planned the party, though I got the impression from Scott that Shinichiro did most of the work (Shinichiro lives in Chiba, but Scott lives in Narita &#8212; the distance does have a bit of a factor).<br />
Kaz and Chris were hiding in the &#8220;Love Room&#8221;, a secluded room in the back, until Scott and Shinichiro announced that it was time for them to be introduced to the awaiting audience. When the time finally came, the cue was &#8220;Mr. and Mrs. May&#8221;.<br />
I don&#8217;t think Kaz is changing her family name, but the announcement did hit home. Chris and Kaz were engaged almost two years ago &#8212; they met almost exactly two years ago. For that length of time, they were together (even if they were living apart) such that I just saw them as more than just a couple. But they&#8217;re married now. My best friends are almost all married now. Gerry, Stuart, Therese, and Chris. Of my closest friends, only Kathryn and I remain. And Kathryn is in no rush (as she put it).<br />
Chris and Kaz tried to do the circuit of people, but had significant difficulty,mostly because everyone wanted to talk to them. Eventually, Scott called for the toast, and the party officially got underway.<br />
The food was excellent (there was a breaded shrimp in some sauce that might as well have been liquified crack for how good it tasted), the beverages flowed freely, and the conversations as I travelled around the room lively.<br />
I was initially afraid that Jen might feel more out of place than usual. She might be taller than me, and look older than she is (the &#8220;Guess Jen&#8217;s Age&#8221; game continued; the nearest guess was 18), but the simple fact was that she didn&#8217;t know a lot of people here. That said, however, she dove into a couple of conversations and did quite well for herself. Of course, it didn&#8217;t hurt that many of the conversations were with guys, who for all I know were hitting on her.<br />
Jen discovered that sake isn&#8217;t the only drink she likes. Someone introduced her to a &#8220;China Blue&#8221;, a drink with blue curacau, some other liquor, and grapefruit juice. Before the end of the night, Jen would have had several of those, a couple beers, and a smattering of other things. My aunt and uncle are gonna kill me if they hear about this any time soon. At least Jen&#8217;s with people she knows and there&#8217;s far less risk involved than if she were out doing the same things with other people.<br />
Scott had planned a game of bingo &#8212; similar to a team-building game I had one once with the Mercedes Benz USA team back in January. You&#8217;re given a sheet with the bingo grid, but no numbers &#8212; the fields are blank. You go around the room, meeting new people, and get their name. You add it randomly to the fields, and then a draw of names might get you a bingo.<br />
I didn&#8217;t play. Instead, Brian (one of the guests) and I sat, talked, drank, and gave our names to everyone who came by. We figured: &#8220;Why go to the effort if people will come to us?&#8221; It was immense fun, and we had a good laugh as a result.<br />
There were many bingos, and many prizes. Jen won a &#8220;personal massager&#8221;. I think I almost died laughing.<br />
Naome and I had several conversations, and at least one kung-fu tickle fight. Unfortunately, Naome isn&#8217;t as ticklish as I am, so there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to her. I had to try, though.<br />
Slowly, but surely, the crowd emptied out into the cold, wet night until it was Chris, Kaz, Jen, Scott, Miyuki, Shinichiro, Riku, Naome, and Cory (another teacher). We were all looking to head home. This had Jen supremely disappointed because there had been much talk, from well over a month and a half ago, about going to karaoke.<br />
I&#8217;m not a singer. Never have been. Yes, I was in the Concert Choir back in high school (see [[Music Trip to Orlando, Introduction|Music Trip to Orlando]]), but that was as an ulterior motive to go down to Florida. So going to karaoke was never really high on my list of priorities.That said, though, get enough drink in me, and you&#8217;ll have a far easier time convincing me of some things. Like singing.<br />
In the eventuality of karaoke coming around, I&#8217;d even planned some of the songs I&#8217;d wanted to do, mostly Elvis and Tom Jones tunes (they suit my voice far better than, say, Avril Lavigne). Such as it was, that was something I didn&#8217;t have to worry about.<br />
Those of us heading back to Yotsukaido climbed into two cabs, the rest headed off in different directions. It had been a long night, and a long sleep was in order&#8230;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was a good day. Not that other days have been bad by any means, but when you can sit back and reflect and feel really good &#8212; that&#8217;s a particularly good day.<br />
Chris was up early to meet Kaz at Tokyo station. We had loosely planned to hit something interesting in Tokyo today, but Ellesen and I needed to sleep in a bit. (Where Chris finds all the energy he&#8217;s got lately, I&#8217;ll never understand.)<br />
<span id="more-277"></span>When we finally awoke, we started to receive instructions from Chris over Ellesen&#8217;s keitai (the Japanese word for their uber-fancy cell phones). It was pretty simple: get your butt to Odaiba. Okay, there were slightly more complicated than that, but for now it&#8217;ll do to say just that.<br />
Before we left Yotsukaido, I needed to get some money. I had, no word of a lie, about 2,000 yen left of my 50,000. That might sound like a lot, but it&#8217;s not. When the trip from Tokyo to Hamamatsucho is about 870 yen, a trip up the World Trade Centre is 620 yen, and the ferry to Odaiba is 400 yen &#8230; there ain&#8217;t much left. With a movie yet to come, not to mention general spending habits, like eating, money became a necessity.<br />
The Post Office in Yotsukaido was closed. It might be due to a national holiday, due to the weekend, or just &#8216;cuz &#8212; I don&#8217;t know. But I did know that there is a post office in the World Trade Center. I only hoped that it would be open when we got there. Otherwise, I&#8217;d be begging for a loan for a couple of days.<br />
And I was right. Mostly right. The post office itself was closed, but access to its ATMs was open. This was good for both Ellesen and myself, as she needed money, too.<br />
And so we went up the World Trade Center. This was my third trip up, but I was showing the view to Ellesen. Chris had reported the weather to be better than the last time we were up, and we could (theoretically) get better pictures. Although it was sunnier, the haze over the city was none too thrilling. Pictures weren&#8217;t much better to be had for me. Ellesen hadn&#8217;t seen this before, though, and took full advantage of it. The thing that impressed Ellesen most, though, was the size. Tokyo is immense, and you can only see that from the top of a very tall building.<br />
A text message from Chris wondering where we were sent us down the tower to catch the water taxi. Chris&#8217; instructions had been to go to a makeshift ticket counter set up in the JR Hamamatsucho station, then have them draw us a map to find the dock so we could take the ferry. The clerks, however, figured out that we didn&#8217;t know Japanese, and provided us with a photocopied map. Although we couldn&#8217;t read the signage, the directions were pretty clear. We had seven minutes to catch the ferry.<br />
Surprisingly enough, despite not reading Japanese and entering the wrong dock terminal (the directions weren&#8217;t clear as to which terminal), we made the ferry just as it was about to pull away from the dock. As it turns out, this was the same terminal Chris and I had come through only days before when we&#8217;d done the bus tour.<br />
The trip across the bay to the Odaiba Seaside Park is quite enjoyable. The taxi is not just for moving people around, but also doubles as a tour boat. A voice track in both Japanese and English pointed out some of the sights as we went along.<br />
The Odaiba Seaside Park is partially built on an old cannon fortification built to protect Tokyo from the &#8220;black ships&#8221; of the American merchant fleet. (I love hearing historical spin from another perspective.) The old walls are still intact, having neither been fired upon or fired from. (The Americans signed a Friendship Treaty that eventually led to the fall of the shogunate.)<br />
Added onto the cannon fortification (now just the walls) is an artificial island that includes two very large malls (one for shopping, and one for food), a very interesting-looking building for Fuji Television, and an amusement park with what had once been the largest ferris wheel in the world (a record held by a mere two months until the British opened the Millennium Wheel).<br />
Chris and Kaz met us at the dock, and we proceeded to wander. Almost immediately, we headed for perhaps the strangest and most unexpected thing you&#8217;d think to find on an artificial island in the middle of the Bay of Tokyo.<br />
A reproduction of the Statue of Liberty. (Quarter-size, of course.)<br />
Why is this here? Got me. Ellesen says there are two of them in Morioka. The Japanese have always seemed to have a thing for America, but this is almost ridiculous.<br />
Although in terms of Odaiba itself, this almost makes sense. It&#8217;s hard to describe what Odaiba is like, just because of how it is set up. It&#8217;s a combination of amusement park, water park (lots of beach, even though no-one was actually dressed in swim suits) and food court from hell, all rolled into a giant case of Japanese excess.<br />
We opted for lunch relatively quickly. Ellesen and I had skipped breakfast to catch the train, and Kaz was hungry (she always seems hungry &#8212; I gotta find out where she puts it all). This led to a monumental search through the food court mall looking for something interesting. And something that didn&#8217;t have a half-hour line-up.<br />
We eventually found something on the 6th floor. It was Japanese (sounds silly, I know, but the food court proffered food of many kinds), but nothing particularly special or fancy. It was a little on the pricier side, but our hunger overtook our thrift.<br />
We didn&#8217;t get to do much else other than have lunch. The plan was to catch the subtitled release of <em>X-Men 2</em> in Chiba, and since the only showing (with the subtitles &#8212; the dubbed version was not really appealing to us) was at 18:25, we needed to head back.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where you see service. As we were heading out of the building, I suddenly realized I&#8217;d left my sunglasses in the restaurant. Chris and I sprinted back upstairs, only to be met by the restaurant&#8217;s manager with my sunglasses in hand.<br />
I guess not many gaijin leave things behind.<br />
We caught the first water taxi back (which conveniently started boarding when we got to the dock), hopped the first train to Tokyo station, and transferred to the Chiba rapid train. A little over an hour and a half after we left Odaiba, we were walking down the streets to Chiba to Parco.<br />
Interesting note for those of you catching movies in Japan. Check with your local Parco department store, at the information desk. It seems to be a service where you can purchase your movie ticket (well in advance, if so desired) for most popular movies for about 5,000 yen cheaper than at the theatre. Why? Dunno. But I ain&#8217;t gonna complain!<br />
We went directly from Parco to the theatre. Ellesen and I went in to hold seats (not that we had much to worry about &#8212; I guess not many people want to see the subtitled version when they can see the dubbed version) while Chris and Kaz waited for one of Chris&#8217; former students, who likes action films. Naome supposedly was also to come, but ended up seeing a friend of hers instead.<br />
The popcorn was stale, but the seats were comfortable, the sound system quite good &#8230; and the theatre served beer. The movie wasn&#8217;t any better as the result of beer, but I think North American theatres should take a hint and start licensing.<br />
Following the movie, the four of us (Chris&#8217; student had other plans) went for sushi, at the same restaurant Chris and Kaz took me to the first night I was here. In fact, we sat at almost exactly the same place. Though perhaps not as tasty as the sushi restaurant at Tsukiji, it was still very good, and hit the spot. The world is good, so long as there&#8217;s sushi.<br />
Returning to the apartment, we sat down to watch one of Chris&#8217; more recent favourite films, Ping Pong. It&#8217;s a Japanese film based on a comic series. It&#8217;s a very engaging film about &#8230; well, it&#8217;s not so much about the game of ping pong so much as it is about people discovering their roles in life. If you can hack the subtitles, I recommend a viewing.<br />
Time for bed. Tomorrow&#8217;s probably going to be a long one&#8230;<br />
