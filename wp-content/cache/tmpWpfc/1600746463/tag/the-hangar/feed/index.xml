								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For anyone who&#8217;s been reading this blog for a while, you know two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I currently live in Costa Rica.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m Canadian.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of those things is about to change.<br />
<span id="more-1928"></span>Almost a year and 2/3 ago, I caught a rumour about Critical Mass thinking of opening an office in Costa Rica. <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/01/do-you-know-the-way-to-san-jose/">That soon evolved into fact</a>, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/06/alive-and-sick-in-costa-rica/">then into reality</a>, and led to me sitting where I am now. The conditions under which I came down here were set up for business purposes, but all led to one fact: I was leaving my home, moving away from all that I knew, to live somewhere else.<br />
In my life, I have moved over 40 times. (I&#8217;ve lost count.)  And I don&#8217;t mean just between the home where I grew up to university and back. I mean <em>moved</em>: picked up the things in my life that mattered, and transferred them to another location to continue my existence. I knew at the time that some of those moves were temporary &#8212; indeed, some of them were for school, but if I&#8217;d been told &#8220;stay put&#8221;, I&#8217;d have been quite content. Naturally, some moves &#8212; <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/1998/01/moving-vancouver/">moving to Vancouver</a>, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2000/03/leaving-vancouver-for-calgary/">moving to Calgary</a>, and especially <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/05/things-to-do-before-moving/">moving to Costa Rica</a> &#8212; have been much more significant, but the basic intention is always the same.<br />
When my family picked up to move here to Costa Rica, we severed ties with Canada. We didn&#8217;t just moved, we left. I mean, come on, we were moving to a tropical country where it&#8217;s summer all year, and everything is wonderful. Why the heck would we even dream of moving back? Right?<br />
Right??<br />
Yeah. Well.<br />
Here&#8217;s the reality: for as much as the weather here is great, and as much as <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/09/14-things-i-love-about-costa-rica/">I love being really near warm oceans and beaches</a>, and as much as <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2009/02/25-coffees/">I love the freaking coffee</a> here (no joke), almost every other day we realise just how much we miss our family and friends, seasons that actually look different from one another, the ease in which we can do some things because we don&#8217;t have to struggle with bureaucracy, and yes, even the snow.<br />
We&#8217;re moving home. Our home. To Canada.<br />
Now before you all jump on me that I&#8217;ve got totally distorted expectations of Costa Rica, just hear me out. All of these things have been taken into consideration. Yes, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2008/09/17-things-i-hate-about-costa-rica/">there are things that have bothered me</a> here. But, guess what, there are things that bother me about going home, too. <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2006/08/calgary-transit-sucks/">Calgary&#8217;s far from perfect.</a> Canada has lots of issues. Maybe it&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re Canadian, but they&#8217;re issues we grew up with, and issues that, in some small way, seem more manageable.<br />
(And yes, I completely and utterly appreciate the humour/irony that <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2009/08/illegal-alien-in-costa-rica/">we only just got our official residency status</a>.)<br />
When we looked long-term, staying in Costa Rica just wasn&#8217;t an option. Monkey will start school in a couple of years, and Alex&#8217;s employment prospects here in Costa Rica hinge on her becoming significantly more fluent in Spanish. As for me, my contract here ends in a couple of months, and it&#8217;s time for me to hand the reigns to someone else.<br />
Officially, my contract ends in December, which is when we&#8217;ll be winging our way back to Calgary. I&#8217;m not looking particularly forward to returning in the winter (seriously, this could be close to the dumbest thing we&#8217;ve ever done), but it&#8217;s the right timing for us.<br />
It&#8217;s still three months away, but already I know I will miss Costa Rica. I will miss the weather. I will miss the people we&#8217;ve met and the places we&#8217;ve been. I miss the food, especially the freshest fruit I&#8217;ve ever eaten. I will even miss the rain and the thunderstorms (mostly &#8216;cuz Calgary hardly ever has them).<br />
I know we&#8217;re going to have a heck of a hard time adjusting back. Reverse culture shock, of a sort. Everything in English. Not having to argue with a sales clerk, or having to use hand gestures (note that this is a problem with us, not the clerk, just something that we&#8217;ve had to do). Having to follow enforced rules of the road (in other words, not driving like lawless maniacs). Having to actually use a furnace and blankets to stay warm at night. Wearing pants (as opposed to shorts &#8212; get your minds out of the gutters, you freaks!).<br />
Three months. It&#8217;s equally a very long time, and will disappear in a blink. One day, not long from now, we&#8217;ll have to reminice about living in Costa Rica, just like we reminice about Calgary right now.<br />
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of years ago, I engaged in my first offshore experience, when we hooked up with a small company out of Argentina to develop and deliver some additions to a website, including the addition of a simple <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym>. It had been a first crack at what would end up becoming a significant change in my career.<br />
At the time, the experience had left a rather bad taste in my mouth, like realising that the glass of milk you&#8217;re drinking is a little off. It wasn&#8217;t that the experience was horrible, just that it could have been a lot better.  <br />
My experiences continued with other groups, mostly in Central and South America, and also included an arm of one of our regular vendors, who shifted operations from the United States to India. And I think it might have been the point at which I decided that if the opportunity arose, I really needed to find out what offshoring was like, first-hand.<br />
Funny how life works, eh?<br />
<span id="more-1262"></span>So here I am, about a year and a half after making my decision, sitting in a converted warehouse in the country of Costa Rica, operating as the offshore agency providing the services. I&#8217;m on the other end of the line now, and I&#8217;m developing a whole new appreciation for the difficulties of running and offshore operation.  <br />
Yes, I said &#8220;developing&#8221;. Just because I&#8217;ve been doing this job for over nine months doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve got all the answers. Far from it, really. What I&#8217;ve got is an appreciation, which is the beginning of understanding. Only when you understand can you really act on a problem. Until then, you spend a lot of time analysing, learning, questioning, fretting, stressing, and working your ass off.  <br />
In my current view (remember, I&#8217;m merely in appreciation, not full understanding), there are two fundamental problems with starting up an offshore company:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finding the right people to operate in a start-up environment</li>
<li>Communicating the urgency that is inherent to dealing with North American clients</li>
</ol>
<p>Allow me to detail both of these points&#8230;<br />
As with any startup, you always need to find people who are dedicated to the realities of all startup companies: They start from nothing, they change constantly, the skillsets of those in the company (at all levels) are unprepared for the dynamics of working together, and the only way to deliver finished projects is to invest heavily in time.  <br />
The tricky part is finding those people. Even in North America, where such a thing is far more commonplace, you need to find people who wish to create, to give of themselves (and ask for little &#8212; often nothing), who can see (or claim to see) the goal that everyone is striving for. There is no such thing as &#8220;not my job&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s expected that everyone throws in what they can, and learns what they need.  <br />
Here, it&#8217;s a little harder. Those people exist, and I&#8217;ve been lucky to find a few of them. But some of the familiar North American ethic is missing. As a result, we need to give more direction than we&#8217;re used to. We need more time to follow up with people, explaining intention and expectation. Projects need more oversight. It&#8217;s a change for everyone.  <br />
Even harder, though, is communicating urgency. North Americans have near-absolute views on deadlines. They want something by a specific date, or there&#8217;ll be hell to pay. There&#8217;s no middle ground, no grace period. Miss your deadline and you&#8217;ll pay a penalty, and its usually monetary (or ends up being monetary). And that doesn&#8217;t account for all the mental anguish that goes along with angry clients &#8212; which, believe me, accounts for a significant part of the reason no-one wants to miss deadlines.  <br />
As we discovered not long after our arrival here in June, the concept of a North American deadline does not translate one-for-one. While there are a few who understand, North Americans tend to refer to the cultural understanding as &#8220;mañana time&#8221;. When you have that kind of a gap in understanding, you&#8217;ll have a gap in delivery.  <br />
Both of these issues lead into a pushing match, and ultimately you&#8217;ll find two things happen: Management time increases, and quality drops.  <br />
Now before everyone goes off on me, saying I&#8217;m calling out generalisms (I am) and not painting an accurate picture (I&#8217;m not), allow me to state something else: This is not inherent only to Costa Rica. This is a problem I&#8217;ve seen with every offshore company I&#8217;ve worked with.  <br />
In fact, these are only the two most common problems. Every company I&#8217;ve worked with that has offshore models has problems like these. But these are far from the only problems. I&#8217;ve seen a couple of other problems creep into the mix as well:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Development ends up going &#8220;rogue&#8221; and refuses to follow specification (this is often due to a &#8220;we know better&#8221; mentality)</li>
<li>Significant increases in paperwork owing to a cultural need for process</li>
<li>Inability to synchronise with vendors due to large differences in timezones</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these lead to the inherent failure of offshoring: It&#8217;s just not that simple.  <br />
In many ways, I&#8217;m actually glad that I&#8217;m seeing problems first-hand. It&#8217;s actually reassuring &#8212; not that we&#8217;re doing things right or that we&#8217;re not alone, it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m actually seeing the problems. It would be far worse to have the problem and not see it.    <br />
Okay, so what do we do? Status quo is not acceptable, as nothing will change. Things will remain in bad shape and we&#8217;ll always be ice-skating uphill.  Some of my Critical Mass co-workers who worked with offshore companies learned the hard way: they spent more time managing the projects, even holding conference calls at 1:00AM to ensure that things were going as expected. The wrote volumes of specifications and schedules, most of which didn&#8217;t seem to actually deliver what they needed. All of us reviewed incremental deliveries to ensure code quality and understanding.  <br />
Of course, that means more work. Which is exactly what North American companies want to avoid. This is &#8212; technically &#8212; why they turned to offshores in the first place: so the companies could work less.  <br />
It&#8217;s an impossibility. You can&#8217;t work less by working more, or vice versa. At least, not over the short-term. And certainly not for complex pieces of work, if you haven&#8217;t already established considerable amounts of process, training, and quality assurance.  Now that I&#8217;ve worked on the other side of the fence, I see where the failure has come most painfully: you can&#8217;t get instant soup in a place where soups are always made by hand.<br />
The answer? None yet, none complete, anyway. Remember, I&#8217;m still working on appreciation. Some of the answer we already know &#8212; longer-term projects with a defined staff, ensuring continuity and understanding. Ensure that your leads are not North Americans, but locals who comprehend the complexities and know the pressures of a deadline. But even those points are &#8212; again &#8212; generalised.  <br />
If I do figure it out, though, I&#8217;ll be sure to post it here. Right along with the link to the page in Amazon.com where you can buy the book I&#8217;ll write about it.<br />
Update! [15 April 2009]<br />
My friend <a href="http://venzaalcocodrilo.blogspot.com/">Ivan Ramirez</a> and I have been discussing working in Costa Rica and building teams almost since I got to Costa Rica back in June 2008. He&#8217;s just put up <a href="http://venzaalcocodrilo.blogspot.com/2009/04/some-thoughts-about-offshore-companies.html">a very interesting post on his blog on Latin American offshoring</a>. If you found any of this interesting, I definitely encourage you to check out his post, too &#8212; he&#8217;s got way more experience with the Latin American labour market than I do.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today marks yet another notch on the belt of my career. Today, I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass (or within the Critical Mass family, anyway) for nine years.  <br />
It&#8217;s weird. Very weird. I&#8217;m actually having trouble comprehending this fact. Nine years of my life (1/10th, depending on how long you think I might live) has been with one company. In my father&#8217;s generation, that would be considered &#8220;getting started&#8221;. In my generation, it&#8217;s considered &#8220;insane&#8221; &#8212; the turnaround is often two years or less.  <br />
But here I am. Nine years, and counting. If you&#8217;d asked me at the end of my first year if I&#8217;d still be around eight years later, I&#8217;d have said that you were crazy. It&#8217;s been a hell of a ride, and at the same time seems almost short, now. But there&#8217;s a lot of memories in those years, too.  <br />
Okay, enough reminiscing&#8230; I got work to do&#8230;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hasta la vista, 2008! You were a tough year in the life, and while you certainly gave me a good run, I&#8217;m not unhappy to see you go. You&#8217;ve lead me further down the road of fatherhood, brought me back dear old friends, brought me new challenges at work &#8230; and of course moved me to an entirely different country. But with all of this, you&#8217;ve brought a whole mess of turmoil, instability, and grief.  <br />
Now for those of you who&#8217;ve not been following along &#8212; and what the heck, even for those of you have &#8212; here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about:<span id="more-1212"></span></p>

<li>Was extremely happy to see the basement finally complete</li>
<li>Switched briefly to a Mac before switching back to a PC (too many issues with emails and meetings); I now curse the reality that I wish I were on one</li>
<li>Came down with an evil flu, despite getting a flu shot</li>

<li>Went to Iona</li>
<li>Went to Inverness</li>
<li>Went to Edinburgh (albeit briefly)</li>
<li>Went to York</li>
<li>Went to Costa Rica twice in three weeks &#8230; the second time to move there</li>
<li>Haven&#8217;t returned to Canada since mid-July (went to bring my family down)</li>
<li>Went to Panama City twice</li>
<li>Saw the Panama Canal (and a ship travel through the locks)</li>
<li>Went to Toronto</li>
<li>Went to Oakville and Burlington</li>
<li>Went to Punta Leona</li>
<li>Went to Montezuma</li>

<li>Went into San José many times</li>
<li>Went to New York City for Christmas</li>
<li>Didn&#8217;t ride nearly enough trains (despite going to the UK)</li>
<li>Attended the Web 2.0 conference</li>
<li>Learnt to drive Costa Rican-style</li>
<li>ComenzÃ³ a aprender español</li>

<li>Missed my many friends dearly &#8212; one feels very alone and separated down here</li>
<li>Made more new friends</li>
<li>Bought a new used car (for far more than it should have cost&#8230;)</li>
<li>Got a traffic ticket for pulling a u-turn</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although we&#8217;re still trying to figure out how to get the most basic things (like reliable phone service), we did manage to throw together a halfways-decent Christmas Party this year. I can take no credit for this whatsoever, as Mark pretty much handled all the basic groundwork for it, with Angelica finishing off the key part of securing a caterer.  <br />
Me? I was nose down trying to figure out how to get everything done before we leave for New York City (which is tomorrow, at 13:20). Mark is a master juggler, a skill I&#8217;ve sadly let slide now that I&#8217;ve got a few more things to juggle. Party organising just doesn&#8217;t seem to be one of them.  <br />
<span id="more-1186"></span>We had it on Friday last, and held it (luckily for Alex and I) at our condo complex here in Santa Ana. It was convenient because we could rent one of the two barbecue pits (really, small houses) and the &#8220;lounge&#8221; space up at the pool area for about $80. It&#8217;s a nice area, and on a nice night (which Friday night was a truly fine example), it&#8217;s a great place to hold a gathering.  <br />
Mark and I effectively forced a complete shutdown of the office (given that we manage the two teams, and they weren&#8217;t packing up fast enough), and forced everyone to jump into awaiting cars (we ended up with too many cars &#8212; I didn&#8217;t need to drive after all, much to my and Alex&#8217;s chagrin). Fighting through traffic, we found our way to the condos, and I into my apartment to collect my family (Alex and Mi Pequeña Niña were also coming).  <br />
At the top, everyone was slowly beginning to loosen up. Sadly, with warm drinks, that came slowly. When the caterers finally arrived (20 minutes later), they brought the much-needed ice to get everyone to relax a bit further. And much chatting was had. And much drinking. Which is pretty much required of any given Christmas party (or Fiesta de Navidad).  <br />
Sadly, the food didn&#8217;t sit well with Mi Pequeña Niña, and she ate almost exclusively potato chips and pretzels. It was without doubt Alex&#8217;s and my lowest point as parents to date. Alex did try to feed MPN something a tad more substantial later, but it didn&#8217;t go over well, so I&#8217;m told.  <br />
The final Secret Santa (Amigo Invisible) came out and parties were revealed as the final gifts were handed out. I had refrained only from a complete lack of reliability (namely that shopping for anyone would be difficult at best). Alex would later admonish me for not giving her the opportunity to shop; I immediately felt kind of stupid for not even thinking of that.  <br />
The gringos also got a present from our new staff &#8212; lovely leather wallets and pens. I was rather taken aback, not having expected this one iota &#8212; I&#8217;m more happy to see these guys happy in their jobs than receiving recognition for anything. Naturally, we had to make a speech. Somehow, and I think it was mostly due to the beer I&#8217;d already consumed to that point, I volunteered to make one &#8230; in Spanish. Aside from a couple of words I simply didn&#8217;t know, I did my best to produce something that sounded reasonable, and not too terrible.  <br />
I personally think I did a better job much later on, when I was talking with Diego almost entirely in (really bad) Spanish.  <br />
Slowly, but surely, people began to trickle out until the taxis arrived at 23:00. That&#8217;s when almost everyone left except for Diego, his girlfriend (or wife, actually, I&#8217;m not sure which it is), David (who wasn&#8217;t through partying just yet), Hermes, Mark, Jason, Jen, and I. Jason and Jen ran for their car shortly thereafter.<br />
By the time everyone finally left, it was after midnight, and Mark, Hermes, and I were left cleaning up the disaster left behind. Actually, that&#8217;s not entire true. The disaster was pretty light, when it came down to it. We had a few things we had to take back (notably leftover booze), but it was pretty easy all things concerned. We loaded the rest into Mark&#8217;s truck, and the three of us headed down to Mark&#8217;s apartment, Hermes roof-surfing the whole way down.  <br />
I think I went to bed around 2:30. That&#8217;s mostly a guess without any real knowledge of what time it was. But it was a good first party.<br />
Now to plan the next one&#8230;<br />

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Way back in June &#8212; the 13th, to be specific (I guess that should have been a first sign, eh?) &#8212; I packed up a whack of things on my desk to bring down to Costa Rica. TeamMG (Mary and Morgan) arranged for this to be shipped down here by FedEx, a company I had used many, many times to get things from Point A to Point B quickly.<br />
Problem: When a company doesn&#8217;t have a complete representation in Point B, you&#8217;re not going to get your box as fast as you thought.<br />
Today is 24 July. I only got the box today.<br />
<span id="more-1024"></span>The box I used was a photocopier paper box. They&#8217;re fairly strong, put up well with abuse. I packed it carefully, because I figured even with a &#8220;good&#8221; shipper like FedEx (more on that in a moment) that it might get jostled a bit. The box as received was battered, torn, well-deformed, and heavily-taped. This was definitely not the condition I expected to receive it in.<br />

Only one thing was damaged &#8212; my Hawaiian Tiki doll (the God of Money). Something must&#8217;ve shifted and broke the legs off. The way I&#8217;d packed it, there&#8217;s no chance of that happening, but things were also moved around in there, so someone really did a piss-poor job of repacking. Should I claim the damages? I suppose so, but somehow the $3,500 dollars to fly back out to the Big Island to get a new one probably won&#8217;t come through. I think some crazy glue will do.<br />

The process to get the box was insane. And it still is for Mark &#8212; his boxes are still in customs, and they want $200 to clear them. Each. All because Mark tossed in some running shoes in lieu of bringing them himself. What the hell! Apparently, Jason&#8217;s in a similar boat, and he&#8217;s got stuff that&#8217;s not even worth $50.<br />
FedEx washed their hands of the affair, too. Apparently, once it&#8217;s inside Costa Rica, it&#8217;s not their problem. Well, FedEx, it&#8217;s definitely no longer your problem, as we&#8217;re no longer going to use you. Your competitor, DHL, seems far more competent and willing to help. Jerks.<br />
Now all I need is some tea and some hot water&#8230;</p>
