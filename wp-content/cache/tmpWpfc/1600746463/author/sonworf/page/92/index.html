	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, the Greedy Bastard hit Cowtown.<br />
The Bastard in question, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is Eric Idle. For those of you buried under rocks since the day of your birth, Eric was one of Britain&#8217;s Monty Python comedy troupe, makers of several years of quality British television and such movies as &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Life of Brian&#8221;, and &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s The Meaning of Life&#8221;.<br />
Eric is self-described as the sixth most friendly Python, after Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, and John Cleese. For those of you unawares, there are only six members of Monty Python. Having now met the man in person, he certainly is pleasant enough.<br />
Eric is the only current touring (former) member of Monty Python. John has a successful acting career (although Eric&#8217;s is fairly prolific), Michael has done several series for the BBC (a documentary-like version of &#8220;Around the World in 80 Days&#8221;), Terry Gilliam is one of Hollywood&#8217;s more ecclectic directors, and Terry Jones has done some bit parts and a few books (he co-authored &#8220;Starship Titanic&#8221; with &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; author Douglas Adams). Graham Chapman died in 1989.<br />
This time through North America (running October to the end of December), Eric&#8217;s running under the banner: &#8220;The Greedy Ba$tard Tour: Another Stupid Evening&#8230;&#8221;. For all those who think he&#8217;s doing it just for money, he&#8217;ll agree with you 100% of the way. As he started off when he came on stage: &#8220;This is to earn money so I can send my daughter through college &#8230; and my wife through collegen.&#8221;<br />
Tamara, Nick, and I went in a group of three, but weren&#8217;t the only Critical Mass folk out. Steve was there with his girlfriend, as was John with his. I can only assume there were others, but we never saw any of them. It was good to see that the three of us weren&#8217;t the only ones interested in a good laugh.<br />
We arrived at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Theatre (usually referred to as just &#8220;The Jubilee&#8221;) around 19:35, for a 20:00 show. Nick and I are Python fans &#8212; Nick even knows some of the The Rutles (Eric&#8217;s answer to The Beatles). Checking the coats (and stashing the camera), we headed in to find our seats.<br />
I&#8217;d never been to The Jubilee before. It&#8217;s not at all what I expected. It&#8217;s attached to the Alberta College of Art and Design (known more informally as ACAD), but does not look at all like a school auditorium. It&#8217;s a three-tiered honest-to-God theatre, regularly hosting operas and ballets. Tonight, it hosted an &#8220;adults-only&#8221; show. Some of Python&#8217;s material, and some of Eric&#8217;s comedy, is not for kids.<br />
The stage was simple: a small piano on the (audience&#8217;s) left side, and a coat rack, chair, guitar stand, and throw rug on the right. Music played softly as people entered the auditorium. With only minutes to the show, the music became louder, as The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; started playing. Several people in the audience did the motions in the chorus. Then one of the actors (it wasn&#8217;t Eric) walked out on stage as one of the Gumbys &#8212; a Python character known for abject stupidity. He attempted the chorus motions. The audience laughed.<br />
The music changed to the infamous &#8220;Spam&#8221; theme, sung by ancient Vikings. (Yep, another Python skit.) On came Eric, to a cacaphony of whistles, hollers, yells, screams, and a lot of clapping. After the crowd calmed down, he started into his routine, pausing only to introduce something never done before: the Encore Bucket.<br />
This was a shiny, stainless steel garbage can. It&#8217;s Eric&#8217;s way of ensuring that he comes on for an encore. The idea is that you throw money in there (or women&#8217;s underwear &#8212; he&#8217;s trying to break through the Tom Jones Barrier), and if there&#8217;s enough, he&#8217;ll do an encore. In reality, all money collected goes to charity (Eric keeps the underwear). So if you&#8217;re seeing Eric Idle&#8217;s Greedy Bastard Tour, bring a few extra bucks for charity.<br />
The only time he took a truly serious note was to mark that tonight is the second anniversary of George Harrison&#8217;s death. Harrison produced movies, and footed the entire bill for &#8220;Life of Brian&#8221;. As Eric put it: &#8220;The most expensive movie ticket, ever!&#8221; Eric and George had been good friends for many years.<br />
As Eric&#8217;s opening dialogue went on, he explained that he had been to The Jubilee before &#8212; 30 years ago, with the rest of Monty Python, on the first (and last) tour of Canada. Eric has been through Canada a couple of times since (his previous tour was &#8220;Eric Idle Exploits Monty Python&#8221;). On his last tour, he was presented with none other than the Monty Python hook, a very long, crooked pole used to drag people offstage in their skits. The group had left it behind in Vancouver at the end of their tour 30 years ago, and Eric was presented it when he returned a couple of years ago.<br />
As he said: &#8220;I can only imagine what this would fetch on eBay!&#8221;<br />
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical as to the content of the show. I mean, I like Monty Python a lot, but would the show really be anything original? It was just Eric, and there&#8217;s no telling if the rest of the players would have the same comedic timing of Python. I was quite happily relieved to find that Eric&#8217;s happy band of six people (including himself) were quite up to the task. And even after many shows, his co-players can still crack up on stage.<br />
We were treated to many classic Python songs, including &#8220;The Penis Song&#8221;, &#8220;The Philosopher&#8217;s Song&#8221;, &#8220;Sit On My Face&#8221;, &#8220;Eric The Half-A-Bee&#8221;, &#8220;I Like Chinese&#8221;, &#8220;Galaxy Song&#8221;, and of course, the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221;. We hoped for &#8220;Every Sperm Is Sacred&#8221;, but not that night. (Tamara had never heard the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221; before, but had it stuck in her head from the moment she heard it until well after we were home.)<br />
The tickets weren&#8217;t cheap ($55), but it was worth every penny. The show was funny, and even localized. (They rewrote the &#8220;Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge&#8221; skit so that the wife was from Okotoks &#8212; something we found extremely funny, because Tamara&#8217;s from Okotoks.) They included some Canadian humour, including ye olde poke fun at Americans.<br />
Two and a half hours after the show started, it was over. Nick and I ran into the autograph line so we could get things signed. We had hoped for the DVDs we had brought, but a sign read: &#8220;The Greedy Bastard will only sign purchased merchandise&#8221;. Thirty dollars later, I have a signed t-shirt. Hey, I might never get another chance to meet a Python.<br />
I did get a chance to speak to Eric. I thanked him for coming to Calgary, and hoped he would return again. He looked quite tired (the show takes a lot out of you when you&#8217;re 62 years young), but was still the quintessential showman.<br />
Even for a self-proclaimed Bastard.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Friday night was not fun. Erin and I got together after work, headed down to her place to eat pizza and watch Indiana Jones movies. Or at least that was the plan. We watched the second half of &#8220;Last Crusade&#8221; (having started it a couple nights earlier), and had a great time. But as we started to watch &#8220;Temple of Doom&#8221;, things turned a slightly darker note.<br />
We&#8217;d been discussing why I *hate* dancing. (It&#8217;s a long, sordid story that I&#8217;m not going to detail here.) Erin wanted to know why, but I didn&#8217;t want to tell her. She kept at it, repeatedly demanding to know. Suddenly, I found myself blasted four years into the past, and it wasn&#8217;t Erin who was asking me, it was Allison.<br />
All the dread, fear, anguish, and pain that I had thought long gone washed over me like an oil spill washing up on a rocky shore. I felt completely helpless. For almost a half hour, I was unable to do or say anything. Erin was beside herself &#8212; she had no idea what to do. She&#8217;d never seen this sort of thing before, and didn&#8217;t know how to handle it. Not that I could blame her.<br />
It&#8217;s a test. Not an intentional one, I have to say, but it is a test nonetheless. A test of how we deal with problems when they arise, and a test of how I&#8217;m able to adjust having someone else in my life again. Had this happened on my own, I&#8217;d probably have just gone for a walk, watched a movie, played a game, something to dull the mind. But not anymore, now I need to work it through. It&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; I&#8217;ve let these old issues sit far too long.<br />
Saturday got off to a slow start. I didn&#8217;t sleep well at all. I ached all over, and memories of the night before were still far too fresh in my mind. But I looked at the day with fresher eyes &#8212; I wanted to have a good day.<br />
Erin and I met up with her parents and Aunt Edie at Joey Tomato&#8217;s at Chinook a few minutes before noon. Erin&#8217;s father was parading around in shorts, despite the fact that the outside temperature was barely 10 degrees. (Later, I would agree with the choice of attire, since the temperature would rise throughout the day.)<br />
Lunch was excellent, of course, though a little quieter than some of the meals I&#8217;ve had with Erin&#8217;s family. Well, quiet except when Erin&#8217;s dad was prodding me to rib Erin a little bit. Not that it takes much to get me to do it, I&#8217;m nearly convinced Erin&#8217;s dad loves it when I&#8217;m the antagonist.<br />
After lunch, Erin, her mom, and her aunt went shopping. Erin&#8217;s dad and I sauntered across Macleod to the Staples. Erin&#8217;s dad wanted my opinion on a scanner he had put on hold. This was the first time I&#8217;d been left alone with Erin&#8217;s father. It&#8217;s probably the single most nerve-wracking thing for a guy to go through. Erin had already been left alone with my aunt, grandmother, and cousins, so it was only fair (certainly to a point) that I spend some time with just her father, even if under the pretenses of assisting in buying a scanner.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen the Canon LiDE 80 before &#8212; it&#8217;s a new one to me. (Not that I&#8217;ve researched scanners for a while.) But it&#8217;s small, light, powered through the USB port, and comes with a negative scanning adapter (definitely a useful tool). I want one. I haven&#8217;t had a scanner in almost four years, and I have to say, I need one badly. I&#8217;ve got a huge pile of photographs and negatives just calling out to be scanned. I just don&#8217;t have $250 laying around to be used.<br />
Oh well, things to plan for.<br />
Dropping the scanner off in the car, Erin&#8217;s dad and I retreated to Chapters to wait for Erin, her mom, and her aunt. We shared a hot chocolate and cranberry juice, chatted, and waited. Didn&#8217;t take too long before we were all reunited. The reunion was short, as Erin&#8217;s parents and aunt had other things to do.<br />
Erin and I took off to 17th Ave. This is one of Calgary&#8217;s prime shopping areas. It&#8217;s also home to Erin&#8217;s favourite store: I-Appeal. If Erin had the chance, she&#8217;d probably buy everything in the store to decorate her condo. But she had a limit of $20, keeping her to just two &#8220;decorative&#8221; elves. (I think they&#8217;re kinda creepily ugly, personally, but Erin thinks they&#8217;re the bees knees.)<br />
Plans that evening were to attend a long-delayed housewarming for Fritz and Jin. This, of course, means I needed to bring a suitable housewarming gift. For some reason, I&#8217;m a big fan of glass flower vases &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why. As Fritz is a Designer (and certainly Jin is quite stylish), I needed something that would be suitable. Luckily, I-Appeal had just what I was looking for.<br />
After a quick stop at Blockbuster (gift certificates), it was into Reid&#8217;s for some wrapping paper. We then wandered over to 8th St. to stop into Janice Beaton. It had been far too long since my last high-quality cheese fix. I tried to convince Erin that she needed to try some, but it seems there&#8217;s desire for cheese &#8212; and then there&#8217;s me. (I did manage to convince her a little later.) Of course, we had to stop in Bernard Callebaut (it&#8217;s almost impossible to pass it by) for a couple bites. A short stop at the house (to drop off the cheese and wrap the present), and we were off to Fritz and Jin&#8217;s.<br />
Fritz and Jin moved into their condo in July (see [[Painting my house (among other things)]]), after waiting another year following their condo burning down (luckily, they hadn&#8217;t been living there at the time) in a collosal fire. Although housewarmings usually take place not long after moving in, Fritz and Jin had some things they had to attend to, first. So, almost three months later, they finally got to have their party.<br />
Well, the first of a couple, anyway. They&#8217;ve got co-workers and Jin&#8217;s friends to deal with, as well.<br />
Erin and I were the first to arrive. No big surprise there &#8212; our group of friends aren&#8217;t exactly the most punctual kind. It gave us time to chat with Fritz and Jin until the others started to appear. Doug, Jensenne and Jon, Virgil, Jon and Pearl, and Teak and Rose soon rounded out our little group. With the tour of the condo out of the way, we proceeded to scatter about the kitchen/dining/living space and chat.<br />
Some of us hadn&#8217;t seen the others in quite some time. For example, I can&#8217;t really remember the last time I saw Jon and Pearl, but it had been quite a while. It was there that we found out for the first time that they&#8217;re getting engaged &#8212; they just have to wait for the ring. Good news, indeed.<br />
Food was plentiful, if perhaps on the not-quite-so nutritious side &#8212; Asian snack foods. Tasty, but not exactly wholesome. Real food came in the form of pizza, which Fritz and Doug went to pick up.<br />
This group is loosely known as the ABCs &#8212; the Asian Brother Crew. This is Chris&#8217; name for the lot of us. The only missing members were Calvin (MIA, near as we could tell), Chris (still in Japan), Adrian (in Japan, visiting Chris), and Tamara (who, sadly, forgot). As it had been a very long time since the last time together, we marked the occasion with a photograph.<br />
The evening would not end there, however. One thing we particularly like doing is bowl. Yeah, kinda hokey, I know, but it&#8217;s fun. Especially when we&#8217;re making fun of the way we play. So we all raced up to Let&#8217;s Bowl in the Northeast &#8212; our favourite lane. As it was 21:30 when we arrived, we figured on a decent amount of time to play. Or so we thought.<br />
An hour and a half wait. For all the times we&#8217;d been there before, we&#8217;d *never* seen a wait that long. And we weren&#8217;t about to wait. A hurried conversation of where to go next drummed up Pacific Place (formerly known as Franklin Mall), which had bowling lanes. Best part was, it was only a few minutes drive away.<br />
Erin and I initially lost everyone else. They&#8217;d gone around front, where they couldn&#8217;t get into the bowling alley. Erin and I went around back (actually by mistake). A few cell phone calls later, and everyone was assembled to play. Our hopes were initially dashed a wee bit when we realized it was five pin bowling instead of the usual 10-pin. It had been a long time since the last time I&#8217;d bowled five pin (see [[Bowling with Co-workers and a Review of the 2001 Academy Awards]]), and I was kind of looking forward to it.<br />
And as it was Erin&#8217;s first time bowling in 14 years, I think she was looking forward to it, too.<br />
I won&#8217;t recount the games &#8212; there&#8217;s no point. Erin did far better than she thought she would (I&#8217;m sure). I bowled okay, though I kept shooting to the left, for some reason. And right after we noticed that the display not only showed the score but also how fast the ball was moving, a few of us tried to get the fastest throw. Fritz won with 43.5 km/h. (I could only do 42.3 km/h.)<br />
The game, and the party, broke up after that. Most of us were tired &#8212; it had been a long day for all. (Especially Teak, who&#8217;d played two back-to-back games of street hockey before coming to the party.)<br />
Can&#8217;t wait until someone else buys a home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s not every day that you turn 30. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s long since been my turn.<br />
This time, it was for my friend Teak. You may remember Teak from a previous birthday of his, when Chris and I felt the need for a little revenge (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). Having no reason to torture my friend, I felt it necessary to show my support for a fellow over-the-hiller.<br />
Teak had reserved the upper floor of Soho, one of the trendier bars in town. Why the upper floor? Teak knows how to throw a party &#8212; he invited 250 people. Now the first rule of parties is to always invite a lot more people than you expect to show up, because about half won&#8217;t come. Teak planned for that, and the upmost floor was ideally suited for 100-130 people.<br />
Tamara, Sheldon (Tamara&#8217;s new boyfriend), and I headed out shortly before 19:30 to rendezvous with the gathering throng at Soho. We were among the first to arrive. Such is the norm, really &#8212; most people seem to like doing what they did in high school, and be fashionably late.<br />
In our haste to leave the house, I realized (much to my chagrin) that I&#8217;d forgotten my camera. I had only recently got it back from Adrian, who had taken it on his whirlwind trip to Japan and the Philippines. I wanted to take photos at Teak&#8217;s birthday &#8212; mostly for Chris, who&#8217;s still trapped in Japan.<br />
Soon, members of the ABC (Asian Brother Crew) started to appear. Fritz and Jin were the first (after Tamara and I), followed soon after by Adrian. Doug appeared not too long after. A few others from Critical Mass (Karen, Mark G., Mark E.) also arrived, as did Arif (arriving with Teak&#8217;s girlfriend Rose), Arthur (with friend Tanya), and former teammate Bonnie (with partner Mandy). We were outnumbered, however, by the rest of Teak&#8217;s friends, a few of whom I vaguely knew.<br />
Tamara and Sheldon didn&#8217;t stay too long before leaving. They didn&#8217;t quite feel like they fit in. (And I did?) I hung out for a while with the ABCs, talked with Bonnie and Mandy for a long time, and then had a long chat with Arthur and Tanya. I couldn&#8217;t stay too long, as my stamina isn&#8217;t quite what it usually is. But without knowing it, I&#8217;d lasted until after midnight.<br />
Arriving home, I flopped on the couch to peruse the late night Saturday television lineup. But once Miao Yin had made herself comfortable in my lap, staying awake just wasn&#8217;t a possibility. I passed out. Explains the kink in my neck.<br />
I&#8217;m getting too old for this.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/" rel="bookmark">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have learned from my jaunt out on Thursday night (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]). I guess I did to a point, but I made one key error: I went out to celebrate Jim&#8217;s birthday.<br />
For the record, Jim&#8217;s a great guy. He&#8217;s a lot of fun &#8212; he has no inhibitions to speak of, he lives more on the edge than most (especially when it comes to skiing), and lives for the moment. He&#8217;s a great web developer, he&#8217;s inquisitive, and is always interested in pushing the boundaries of website development. Unlike most people, Jim doesn&#8217;t really have a shell to come out of &#8212; he wears pretty much all his internal organs on his sleeves.<br />
What&#8217;s all this mean? Well, when you receive an invitation from Jim, asking you to attend an evening of drinking, you can immediately know where it&#8217;ll likely head. The fact that today is Jim&#8217;s 26th birthday made events of last night all the more &#8230; necessary.<br />
I arrived at Jim&#8217;s apartment (a two-minute walk from the venerable Rose &amp; Crown pub) shortly after 20:00, the approximate time we were asked to arrive. Upon entering the apartment to the loud calls of Scott (who&#8217;d arrived mere moments before me), James (already quite well into the bag), and two of Jim&#8217;s friends (whose names I&#8217;m drawing a blank on), I was informed of the house rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No smoking inside. (No worries there.)</li>
<li>No throwing large objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, there were no other rules. But there was a bit of preparation.<br />
As each person arrived, they had to roll dice. For most people, it was three. Women only had to roll two. Mia and Lindsay got away with only one &#8212; Mia was on antibiotics, so was taking a (wisely) careful approach. The number you rolled were the number of drinks you had to have before the night was over. The rules (as stated by Jim) meant that all ones were actually sevens. Thusly, the drink minimum was six, and the maximum was 21. Jim (and Luke, the co-birthday boy) each had to drink 26, because that&#8217;s their new age.<br />
I rolled a 17. Figures. James rolled a 20. He finished even before we left for the Rose &amp; Crown.<br />
To ensure that everyone had their share, you strung the number of candies (taken from a candy necklace) onto a piece of dental floss, which you wore around your necklace. For each drink you finished, you ate one of the candies. Beers and shots counted as one. For pints, it was in groups of three: first pint was a single drink, the next two were two drinks each, for a total of five.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if anyone every really put that rule to the test.<br />
With most of the group assembled around 23:30, we departed for the Rose &amp; Crown (Mia and Lindsay had come and gone by that time). It was cold, but the alcohol kept us (somewhat) warm. Luke bypassed the pub, saying he needed food. He never came back. We kept going at the Rose &amp; Crown, talking drinking, and eating nachos until &#8230; well, until you couldn&#8217;t hang out any longer.<br />
I stopped around 1:30 or so. I was out of money (I had budgeted myself as a limiting device) and feeling kinda tired. I also didn&#8217;t want to relive Friday when I woke up later this morning. So it was off towards home, stopping at Canadian Pizza Unlimited for a little repast, and at the Mac&#8217;s to pick up a litre of Gatorade and a small bag of chips. (Gatorade restores the salts, etc. your body loses while drinking.)<br />
Falling asleep on the couch, I awoke only when Tamara came crashing through the door around 4:00. I don&#8217;t wholly remember her return. I just rolled over and went back to sleep. I haven&#8217;t slept that well in a long time.<br />
Aside from being really tired, I had a much better day than on Friday. Oddly enough, it felt really good to just laze around for a change. It&#8217;s been a while since I outright relaxed. I can only imagine what kind of a day Jim must&#8217;ve had. But something tells me that he wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was not so great &#8212; he almost certainly had a great time last night.<br />
As for me, I think I&#8217;m going to remain sober for a while yet to come. Two nights of debauchery in such close proximity isn&#8217;t good for me. I might begin to like it.<br />
Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t finish the 17. I might have actually had 13 drinks, including shots. Even then, I&#8217;m not too sure. It was probably less &#8212; I cheated a couple of times.</p>

		<blockquote><p>There were green alligators, and long necked geese,<br />
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,<br />
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as your born,<br />
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.<br />

<p>There are all sorts of smart things one can do on a school night. Getting drunk ain&#8217;t one of them.<br />
For those of you no longer in the scholastic world, a &#8220;school night&#8221; is no different than those you experienced at school. Basically, most weekday nights (not counting Friday) and Sunday night. So named because you have to get up early in the morning, file yourself off to a building, and concentrate on things that you might not otherwise like doing.<br />
For the last three days, I&#8217;ve been in all-day meetings. We&#8217;re planning out the 2004 projects for Mercedes-Benz. Now that I&#8217;m part of the lead team, I now participate in these meetings. They&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. We sort out all sorts of issues and really get a good feel for the direction we want to take the account.<br />
But they are draining.<br />
It&#8217;s like having a Martian Brain Sucker attached to your skull all day. By the end of it, you&#8217;re exhausted. The advantage is that you feel really good about the work you&#8217;ve done. All in in all, it&#8217;s a good experience.<br />
&#8216;Course, the best part is the dinner that follow the last day. That&#8217;s when the MB team goes out for dinner. Well, &#8220;dinner&#8221; is a subjective term, since we eat a little and drink a lot. (The amount of drinking varies, usually inversely proportionate to how smart you are about when to stop.) But it&#8217;s all fun.<br />
To make things more interesting, I didn&#8217;t leave right at the end of the day. You see, irony of ironies, the site that I worked on directly (and for which we were having the dinner), MBUSA.com, was down. It had been down since about 11:00 that morning. All because of a database edit. A fairly simple thing, really, which is why we were so utterly puzzled when the &#8220;fix&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.<br />
When 17:00 rolled around, the fixing was still at full speed. I got the skinny on what was going on (I only knew during the day that there was a problem, but not exactly what it was) and tried to understand what part of the problem was. (There was a lot of Java discussion, which I don&#8217;t possess enough of an understanding to truly grasp.) In a nutshell, there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to help.<br />
So I went out to get drunk.<br />
Well, that wasn&#8217;t so much the intention so much as the result. And lest ye be thinking I&#8217;m turning into a raging alcoholic, please rest your fears. Now I know there are a number of stories that always seem to start: &#8220;So we went out to get drunk&#8230;&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I don&#8217;t live my entire week like that &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have made it 31 years if I did. Just that the drinking stories are usually the most fun.<br />
The Wildwood Pub is one of the nicer places in town to meet. It used to be a lot better. Sadly, as I found out last night, their beer quality has begun to sink dramatically. Peter, our newest copywriter, was telling me to avoid the stuff. I should have listened. Between Peter and myself, we tried every variety of beer they had (there&#8217;s only six or seven of &#8217;em). They were all bad. We both switched to Keith&#8217;s.<br />
I think I ended up being the only technology person in attendance. (Most of the others, sadly, were trapped at the office trying to resolve the site problem. The fix, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was to restore a previous backup of the database.) So I guess I felt a responsibility to represent. [Insert cliched reference to LA gangland-style comrades here.]<br />
That might have been what possessed me to drink beer a little too quickly. Either way, a good time was had. So good, in fact, that eventually, it was down to just five people: Dan (the Managing Director &#8212; the Big Kahuna, if you will), Mabel (Dan&#8217;s assistant), Jason (Project Manager), Daryl (Account Manager), and yours truly. That was when Mabel convinced us that we had to go somewhere else.<br />
We retreated to two cars: Mabel&#8217;s and Dan&#8217;s. I rode in Dan&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d never been in a Mercedes-Benz before. (Hey, he *is* the Managing Director. He kind of has to own one.) It&#8217;s nice &#8230; the rear seats are brutally cold, but it is nice. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever own one, though.<br />
Mabel and Dan zig-zagged through Calgary. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I knew where they were going, but we eventually ended up at Mabel&#8217;s apartment, where she ditched her car. The five of us continued in Dan&#8217;s to our destination: Aussie Rules.<br />
Aussie Rules is an Australian bar. (Or at least, it&#8217;s supposed to be.) Now before you think that&#8217;s a little strange, here&#8217;s something else to make you scratch your head: It ain&#8217;t the only one in town. Yes, there is another one: The Flying Emu (okay, so technically, it should be a New Zealand bar), just down from my old apartment.<br />
So you think I&#8217;d see kangaroos, drink Foster&#8217;s, and eat barbecued shrimp, right? Nope. We listened to dueling pianos.<br />
Yes, dueling pianos. Perhaps one of the stranger things to see in a bar. Two pianos (baby grands), facing each other. Two player/singers. But it&#8217;s not a competition &#8212; they play together, banging out whatever songs people request (or whatever they feel like playing). Mabel led us to the table right in front of the stage so we could get the full effect.<br />
We came at an opportune time (which I can only assume was in the vicinity of midnight), as these guys had been playing (and drinking) for a couple of hours. They were definitely well into their silly stage. While they did play great music (they actually did a couple lines out of Gowan&#8217;s &#8220;A Criminal Mind&#8221; on a request I shouted out; they wouldn&#8217;t touch Gordon Lightfoot), they also did a pub favourite. This was Mabel&#8217;s request.<br />
At some point in your life, you&#8217;ve probably heard The Irish Rover&#8217;s &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;. If you listen to it the way the Rovers do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is a very nice song. If you listen to the way the Dueling Pianos do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is an Olympic event.<br />
When the request was made, one of the two pianists (a guy about 40 lbs overweight, I&#8217;d guess) climbed up on top of the piano (I assume it can easily handle the weight of someone on the lid), picked up a microphone, and hopped over to the top of the other piano, and prompted demanded everyone stand up.<br />
Incidentally, I assume they&#8217;ll only do this song after people have been drinking long enough.<br />
So here&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s all about a couple of the verses (here&#8217;s a link, <a href="http://www.irish-rovers.demon.co.uk/lyrics/unicorn.htm">in case you want to know what the lyrics actually are</a>), repeating the chorus often, making the audience mimic the animals mentioned in the chorus, and following the direction of the singer (for example, when he yells: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221;, you point at the bar). If you manage to get to the end with all the motions without laughing yourself to the floor, you&#8217;ve done pretty well.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it. But I didn&#8217;t land on the floor.<br />
Anyway, without going into excrutiating detail (&#8216;cuz you know I could), we had a blast at Aussie Rules. Before we knew it, there was the Last Call. At the time, it didn&#8217;t really click with me what the time probably was. For some reason, I decided that whatever time it was, it wasn&#8217;t really that late. It didn&#8217;t feel that late.<br />
Time flies when you&#8217;re drunk.<br />
We upped and left (paying the bill, of course) and headed towards downtown, dropping Mabel off along the way. Then it was over to the Mercury, another Calgary establishment. I have no idea what time it was when we arrived. It couldn&#8217;t have been too late &#8212; the place was still serving. Dan decided we needed some Irish Whisky to finish off the night.<br />
Dan drove us home. I live somewhat close to Dan, but saved him the trip through Sunnyside by having him drop me off at 2nd Ave and Centre St. From there, it&#8217;s a 20 minute walk home, which I really needed. It gave me enough fresh air to remember to drink a couple glasses of water and take a couple Tylenol to stave off the inevitable hangover.<br />
Tamara had been home barely 30 minutes before I walked in. She laughed. I was a wreck, and she knew it. (Technically, I knew it too, but just wasn&#8217;t willing to acknowledge it.) I had the water, pills, quick run through the bathroom, and crawled into bed somewhere around 3:00.<br />
Well, I assume I crawled into bed. I don&#8217;t really remember that step, but since I woke up in there, that&#8217;s about as close an assumption as I can make. My alarm &#8212; Chris&#8217; stereo which clicks on at 5:20 playing the Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; album (the entire thing &#8212; that&#8217;s over 45 minutes long) &#8212; didn&#8217;t wake me up. Not even remotely. I forgot to set my secondary alarm. Luckily, I have a backup.<br />
It&#8217;s furry, has four feet, and purrs. She also meows really loudly in the morning when she wants to be fed.<br />
At 7:37, I bolted out of bed in a bit of a panic, threw my head under the tap to get the bedhead down, dressed, shaved very quickly, ran a toothbrush across my teeth, and was in the process of about to run out the door when I realized Tamara was still asleep. We carpooled. I don&#8217;t drive to work usually, but considering we had to be at work for 8:00, I made an exception.<br />
The hangover kicked in around 8:30. And it got progressively worse all morning. The more I moved, the worse it got. Fortunately, nothing so serious that I was ready to &#8230; well, y&#8217;know, but I sucked back a few aspirin with ginger ale to try quieten the body. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a greasy lunch at A&amp;W that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Well, as normal as anyone can feel after mimicking a chimpanzee in a Australian bar in suburban Calgary at some ungodly hour of the night because I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for my own good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. And it&#8217;s not even Hallowe&#8217;en yet.<br />
Starting early this week, the weather folk started telling us to prepare for Calgary&#8217;s first snowstorm of the season. This is something we&#8217;ve heard a couple of times before &#8212; some of you might have heard about this &#8220;big dump&#8221; we were supposed to get back in September (we had, at most, a light dusting).<br />
This time, though, they weren&#8217;t wrong. Tuesday, it started raining. And the temperature fell all day. By 20:00, it was snowing. Only colder things (e.g. cars and benches) were gathering an accumulation. Everywhere else it was melting away. I walked home from downtown &#8212; by the time I got there, it was clear that this wasn&#8217;t going to be a simple dusting.<br />
The temperature dropped overnight, and the snow fell harder. By morning, there was at least four inches of snow on my front walk. I debated for a moment on either shovelling before the gym, or dealing with the aftermath when I got home. I chose the latter, mostly because I wanted to get to the gym, and my snow shovel was in the garage.<br />
Before I left, I realized that I would not be able to wear my shoes outside. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve worn running shoes &#8212; the same ones I would wear to work any other given day. Sounds a little chilly, I know, but because I&#8217;m always moving, it&#8217;s never been a problem. But my current choice of footwear was definitely not suited to winter weather.<br />
Thus, I hauled out my pair of winter boots. They had not seen outdoors in over six years. The last time I&#8217;d worn them was when I worked in downtown Toronto. I had to don a second pair of socks (wool ones), as the rubbing of the leather would probably wreak havoc on my poor feet. These boots have massive grip &#8230; on anything that&#8217;s not ice (as I found out this morning when my heel got a little too far ahead of me, and I found myself sitting in the middle of Centre Street).<br />
None of the roads had been ploughed, and only one short segment of the sidewalks in my area had been shovelled (the guy gets up even earlier than I do). Memorial Drive was a mess, as the night time traffic wasn&#8217;t frequent enough to clear the road. Fortunately, the city Peanut Pusher had cleaned off part of the pathway, giving me an easier walk to the Prince&#8217;s Island Park footbridge. The bridge was a little difficult, and the snow was still deep on the other side. I was a couple minutes late getting to the gym.<br />
The snow was still falling heavily when I left the gym over an hour later. The walk to work wasn&#8217;t easy. Although more sidewalks were now clear, they were also quite slippery. (Most hadn&#8217;t put down any salt.) I was about five minutes late getting to work.<br />
Some people were almost two hours late. And people wonder why I live in the inner city&#8230;<br />
It snowed most of the day. It was still snowing when I went home and shovelled the snow from my walkway and sidewalk. (On the bright side, the thick layer of snow obscures the scar where the sewer was replaced &#8212; see 24 September 2003.)<br />
The snow had stopped by this morning. But it was -12 when I left the house for the gym. Minus 12. It&#8217;s not even November yet. The windchill was double that. So say that this is not exactly expected (or desired) is to put it mildly.<br />
And, of course, tomorrow is Hallowe&#8217;en. The forecast is for at least -7, if not colder. You won&#8217;t be seeing any ballerinas, elves, or fairies tomorrow night. This years&#8217; hot costume in Calgary? Inuit.<br />
Snow is forecast for a few days yet to come. We won&#8217;t see above-zero temperatures for at least a week, by the looks of it. This is definitely one of the weirdest autumns I&#8217;ve yet experienced.<br />
I&#8217;m not ready to go walking in a mid-fall (hence, not-quite-winter) wonderland.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I love seeing old friends. I just hate seeing them leave.<br />
Therese was in town this weekend. Not really to visit with people so much (though that was one thing she did), but to defend her dissertation &#8212; the last step in obtaining her PhD. It&#8217;s the end of a very long road for Therese, something she&#8217;s been working hard to complete for over a third of her life.<br />
The defence was on Thursday afternoon. I had vowed to leave her be until then, since I knew that she&#8217;d be in preparations until then. We ended up talking for a while Wednesday afternoon &#8212; Therese called me while she took a little break. I&#8217;m not sure if she called so much for a social conversation, or looking for affirmation. As Therese would explain to me, graduate students often have low self-worth, having been told time and time again their work isn&#8217;t good enough. Luckily, it didn&#8217;t take much to instill faith in her knowledge and wisdom.<br />
Either that, or she was gullible enough to believe me.<br />
Therese&#8217;s defence began at 14:00 Thursday afternoon. Exactly what happened in there, I will never know. (Not that it&#8217;s really any of my business, anyway.) The defence was supposed to last about two hours, after which, Therese would receive her final grade. It&#8217;s a three-point score. If you get a &#8216;1&#8217;, you get champagne. If you get a &#8216;2&#8217;, you get a congratulations. If you don&#8217;t get either, you get to do it over again. Therese would find out around 16:30 what that score was. Ideally, that&#8217;s when I would find out if I had to start calling her &#8220;Doc&#8221;.<br />
16:00 came and went without any news. I called around 16:45, in hopes of catching her before something happened (we were supposed to get together that evening). I ended up at home around 17:45 without so much as a peep. I called again, and caught Therese in the midst of something very loud. I didn&#8217;t ask if she passed. I didn&#8217;t have to. I knew.<br />
&#8220;So, can I call you &#8216;Doc&#8217; now?&#8221;<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present the new Dr. Therese Hollingsworth. (Feels kinda weird to be writing that, I have to say.)<br />
The plan was to meet at Catch at 19:15 (the first time they had a table for five) and celebrate. (Besides, Therese had $50 in gift certificates to spend.) Therese drove over with her friend Joe, Geoff and Deanna would meet us there later. When I arrived, I found Therese alone at the table. It had only been a month and a half since I&#8217;d last seen her, but it felt like a lifetime.<br />
What made it more poignant was that this was a different Therese. This wasn&#8217;t the Therese I had come to know over the last decade. This Therese was happy, relaxed, and for the first time in her life, free of school. And just to complicate things even more (as if finishing her doctorate, moving to Montreal, and buying a home weren&#8217;t enough), Therese is three months&#8217; pregnant. In a few short months, two of my best and closest friends will be parents.<br />
I suddenly feel about 10 years older. (That&#8217;s 28 for those of you keeping count.) I&#8217;m not ready for this level of maturity. I&#8217;m too young for this.<br />
We ate a wonderful dinner and celebrated Therese&#8217;s success. The conversation around dinner naturally stemmed towards Therese&#8217;s pregnancy, sprinkled every so often with the defence and how it had gone and what Therese was going to do with her post-doctorate in Montreal. Life, it seems, rarely stays in place.<br />
I drove Therese to Stefanie&#8217;s that night, where Therese would stay until she leaves for Montreal this afternoon. But this wasn&#8217;t goodbye yet &#8212; there was still much to do. And Friday night would be such an event.<br />
Geoff (I should point out that I&#8217;m not talking about myself in the third person &#8212; this is *another* Geoff) booked the private room at the Blind Monk for Therese&#8217;s &#8220;reception&#8221;. So, after work, Erin and I headed down (after making a quick pit stop at Bernard Callebaut &#8212; Stuart had asked me to pick up some chocolates for Therese), where Therese got to meet Erin for the first time.<br />
The evening was long &#8212; running from about 19:00 to just after midnight. For us, it was tiring. For Therese, it was a marathon. Being on Eastern time, still exhausted from the defence, and pregnancy don&#8217;t really help one&#8217;s stamina. But Therese was among the last to leave.<br />
The next day, later in the afternoon, I picked up Geoff and Therese from the university to go shopping at Chinook. Therese and Geoff were going to visit Jeanine, Dory, and their new baby in Innisfail the next day, and weren&#8217;t about to go up empty-handed. Baby clothes and toys were the order of the day. I even threw in a small blanket with a bunny head sewn in the middle. (It sounds rather morbid, but it is cute.)<br />
Geoff left early, as Therese and I finished shopping. First to Willow Park for wine &#8212; a thank you gift for Therese&#8217;s advisors. Then it was to PetSmart to obtain a gift for Stefanie and Ian, who had put Therese up for a few days. Then it was the long drive back to Stefanie&#8217;s (not counting a side trip for a quick snack). Therese and I talked the whole way. I knew this would be the last time I&#8217;d see Therese for a while.<br />
Leaving her was difficult. I didn&#8217;t see Therese (or Stuart, for that matter) as much as I would have liked while she lived in Calgary. Now she&#8217;s 3,000 kilometres away, and three months&#8217; pregnant. I&#8217;ll not be seeing her again until after her child is born. We both found it hard to left go. Luckily, the dark streets were empty as I drove down the street. I could barely see the road through the tears.<br />
My weekend did not end there, though. Sunday brought around another first for Erin &#8212; not only had she met one of my closest friends (she had met Stuart when he had come out a month ago to ship out the contents of their house), but now she was going to meet my family.<br />
Well, &#8220;clan&#8221;, I guess. Since Mom, Cathy, and Craig live back in Ontario, Erin won&#8217;t meet them until Christmas (or so). But this was a chance for her to meet my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, cousins Jen, Pam, and Darren, Sean (Pam&#8217;s boyfriend), and of course, Nana.<br />
Needless to say, Erin was a little nervous.<br />
Actually, even *I* was a little nervous. I mean, they&#8217;re my family and I love them to death, but it&#8217;s hard to know how things will go. It&#8217;s not that I planned on disaster or anything (I wouldn&#8217;t have brought Erin if I didn&#8217;t think things would go well), but you never really know how well things will go until they happen. Besides, strange things always seem to happen when we go over there for dinner.<br />
Example: Mike announced that he had to pack up three bags of crabs for a co-worker. This suddenly conjured images of three large bags of Snow or Alaskan King, making me wonder what bet Mike had lost. I wasn&#8217;t the only one with this thought, and we soon found out that he had meant crabapples, not seafood. A co-worker wanted to make crabapple jelly. This led Mike, Jen, Sean, Darren, and I outside and quite literally up a tree.<br />
Sadly, many of the apples were going soft (some were outright rotten), but there were still many to be had. The tricky part, though, is getting them off the tree. Rotten apples are a breeze &#8212; just shake the branch. The good ones have a much stronger grip, and have to be picked by hand. Darren climbed a latter. Mike hopped on the fence. I went up the tree itself. (And have all the scratches to prove it.) It must&#8217;ve been quite the sight to see all of us in the denuded tree. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find out when Brenda gets her photos developed.<br />
Dinner, as expected, was outstanding. The food was excellent, and the conversation well matched the repast. But dinner was cut a little short. It seemed Darren and Sean were harbouring a virus, which showed through soon after the meal was complete &#8212; they were fading fast. Dinner was over by 20:00. A little unusual for my family, but not unwelcome &#8212; it gave us plenty of time to drive Nana home, me to drop of Erin (who lives in the deep south of Calgary), and be home in time to get my butt up for gym in the morning.<br />
I now sit, staring out my window, half wishing I could see planes taking off from the airport. I&#8217;d wave to them, knowing eventually Therese&#8217;s plane would be passing over. Instead, I have to wave at the crackheads and hookers who love hanging out in our area.<br />
Have a safe flight, dear friend. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be too long &#8217;til when next we meet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In years previous, I&#8217;ve spent Thanksgiving with my family. This year, however, I spent it with Erin&#8217;s.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t a spur-of-the-moment thing. In fact, this was loosely planned from the last (and first) time I&#8217;d met Erin&#8217;s parents (see [[Meeting the parents]]). The idea had arisen during the dinner, when (thorough engaged in conversation, not at all affected by the wine we were drinking or by the comradery Erin&#8217;s dad and I felt as we took on Erin in a battle of wits) Erin&#8217;s father had suggested that next time we might stay the night and not have to worry about what we ate or drank.<br />
Thanksgiving was just the next logical opportunity. And with my family out of town, there seemed no reason not to go.<br />
Not there wasn&#8217;t any possible apprehension. Let&#8217;s be realistic here &#8212; I&#8217;m spending over 24 hours with my girlfriend&#8217;s parents (in their home). I&#8217;ve met them from before, so in that respect there&#8217;s no pressure, but this is a slightly different aspect. In my last serious relationship, I spent the night on my first visit. But I slept in a separate bed. Erin and I were destined for the same room, same bed. At times, I almost worry that there&#8217;s *too* much acceptance. If that actually makes any sense&#8230;<br />
We headed out from Calgary late Sunday morning. I love long weekends &#8212; Sundays never seem sad because you don&#8217;t have to go to work the next day. I think I&#8217;ve always disliked Sunday for that reason. (I&#8217;ve never minded long weekend Mondays, though.) The day was cool, but bright, and the trip down to Nanton was fairly speedy &#8230; except for that stretch of Highway 2 just north of High River being repaved.<br />
Dinner preparation was already well underway. The turkey was due to hit the barbecue (yes, not the oven &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how well it works) at 13:00. As Erin and were running a little late, the original plans for lunch had to be altered. While Erin&#8217;s dad stuck around to ensure that the turkey hit the heat on time, Erin, Erin&#8217;s mom, and I went on a little trip to retrieve sustenance.<br />
Nanton&#8217;s a small town. Erin&#8217;s parents live a block away from the &#8220;downtown&#8221; core. (If you drive south from Calgary on Highway 2, you&#8217;ll pass right through downtown Nanton.) You can walk around the downtown in about 20 minutes, I think. About half of the stores are antique shops, there&#8217;s a couple of restaurants, a pub or two, a CIBC, one hotel (near as I can tell, anyway), and a few grain elevators.<br />
Nanton, once upon a time, was a (fairly) major station on CP&#8217;s MacLeod subdivision, when it ran from High River down to Ft. MacLeod. (Assumedly for lack of profitability, the subdivision was closed and the tracks ripped up south of High River between 1998 and 1999.) Today, the rail bed is still very visible, and the grain elevators sit forlorn, no longer in active (rail) use.<br />
Whether or not the disappearance of the railroad has led to Nanton&#8217;s shrinking commercial base (there are a number of closed businesses) is a debatable one. The loss of the railroad has affected other towns in the past (Hanna, Biggar, Melville, Stratford), and some manage to recover through various efforts (such as the Stratford Festival). Nanton, however, seems quite content to be as it is.<br />
The three of us wandered across a somewhat chilly downtown to a small restaurant on Highway 2 north (the highway divides running through Nanton), sitting between the road and the rail bed. While the name of the place completely escapes me, it&#8217;s the only (open) restaurant on that side of the road. There you&#8217;ll find all sorts of homemade-type foods. And without a doubt, possibly the best sandwich I&#8217;ve ever had. (Mind you, the uber-fresh, all-natural bread from a little bakery in High River contributed to that.)<br />
After some discussion, Erin and I went for a walk around town. Specifically, I wanted to see all the antique shops. I think Nanton&#8217;s second-largest industry after agriculture is antiques &#8212; there&#8217;s more stores in two blocks than in most of Calgary, I think. And the prices are actually pretty reasonable (well, except for one place). Most of the items are quite interesting, too, and you don&#8217;t have to spend huge amounts of time filtering through things.<br />
One store in particular is massive. Once upon a time, it was a hardware store on the main level, with apartments in the second floor. Now the entire building is nothing but antiques. Name it &#8212; it&#8217;s probably in there, somewhere. Once upon a time, so I&#8217;m told, the store owners had things laid out very carefully. The apartments were laid out as &#8220;suites&#8221;, with entire collections made out so you could (in theory) buy an entire suite at once. The original owners sold and moved on, and now things are just stacked to the ceiling.<br />
There was only one shop we didn&#8217;t make it into before closing time. But by then, Erin and I didn&#8217;t really care too much &#8212; the whine of Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; fridge and the musty smell of the antiques gave the both of us headaches. We retreated to Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; home to do something about the pain.<br />
Dinner was the traditional fare for Thanksgiving: turkey, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and buns. For most of the day, I managed to keep myself clear of food preparation. But as Erin was mashing potatoes, I felt the urge to suddenly interject.<br />
I have issues with mashed potatoes. I hate them. Well, to be specific, I hate plain mashed potatoes. They&#8217;re boring. They have no flavour, and almost no texture. It bothers me immensely. So when I saw Erin&#8217;s mom bringing out the milk, I suggested a slight modification to the dish: Beer.<br />
Yeah, I know, beer&#8217;s my solution for everything. In this case, it partly is. You want to make really good mashed potatoes? Here&#8217;s what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-6 medium-sized red skin potatoes</li>
<li>1 medium-sized white (or yellow) onion</li>
<li>2-5 cloves of garlic (depending on how strong you like)</li>
<li>1 can Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown (or beer of choice)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>dried or fresh rosemary</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean, but do not peel, the potatoes (there&#8217;s a lot of flavour in the skin). Cook as you would normally, until ready to mash. While cooking the potatoes, chop the onion and put into a frying pan on medium-low heat. Cover the frying pan with a lid, uncovering only occasionally to stir (you don&#8217;t want anything to burn). This will caramelize the onions. When you&#8217;re ready to start mashing the potatoes, chop and add the garlic to the onions. Mash the potatoes with a hand masher &#8212; it&#8217;s more work, but the texture is better than with a blender. Pour in only as much beer as you need to mash the potatoes. You can go for thick and chunky or &#8220;creamy&#8221;, depending on what you like (I find that just enough beer to take most of the large lumps out is perfect). Add the onion/garlic mixture, sprinkle some rosemary, and mash some more.<br />
Everyone seemed to like them. (Well, why wouldn&#8217;t they?)<br />
I also dabbled in making the gravy, when Erin&#8217;s mom tried to back out of making it by saying there weren&#8217;t enough drippings. (Small children could have swam with all the drippings we had.) I was more than happy to dive in and &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem.<br />
The turkey was completely free-range organic. The farm it came from (Sunworks Farm in Armena, AB) is so eco-friendly that its pamphlet even advertises that it&#8217;s &#8220;predator-friendly&#8221;. It&#8217;s more expensive, to be sure, but I have to say &#8212; you can taste what turkey is *supposed* to taste like. This is a farm I&#8217;m definitely going to have to look into much closer in the future.<br />
Oh. I have to mention the cranberry sauce. (I can hear the &#8220;oohs&#8221; from Cathy and Mom.) I&#8217;ve never liked cranberry sauce. Felt it was just not the sort of thing I would eat with turkey. Well, Erin&#8217;s mom pulled a recipe for &#8220;Gourmet Cranberry Sauce&#8221; from one of the bazillion &#8220;Best of Bridge&#8221; cookbooks. It&#8217;s essentially cranberries (fresh or frozen), oranges, and Gran Marnier. Screw the turkey &#8212; that stuff you can eat on its own.<br />
Even though we were quite full from the first round, we had to partake of dessert &#8212; pumpkin pie. As we briefly congregated in the kitchen to carry out the dessert, Erin&#8217;s mom suddenly thrust a small crystal bowl mostly filled with a transparent green substance.<br />
Lime Jell-o.<br />
Now, there are probably a few people in my family who will laugh at this. The rest of you are probably confused beyond all heck.<br />
What&#8217;s the deal with the lime Jell-o? This stems back to the last time I was in Nanton. I&#8217;d told Erin&#8217;s parents about Christmas (and other family dinners) at my father&#8217;s mother&#8217;s home in Leaside (Toronto). At the time, I&#8217;d hated all the other desserts: pies, some cakes, trifle, etc. So Grandma had always make bowls of Jell-o for me, which I sometimes had to fight over with others.<br />
Erin&#8217;s mom had remembered, and made me a bowl of Jell-o. Erin was thorough confused, apparently having forgotten that conversation. Heck, even *I* hadn&#8217;t realized why Erin&#8217;s mom had made it at first, until I remembered the stories I&#8217;d told the last time I was there.<br />
Needless to say, I like Erin&#8217;s parents.<br />
We had a late harvest Riesling with dessert. By that point, my stomach was crying &#8220;uncle&#8221;, and I spent about 45 minutes trying to put myself in a semi-comfortable position as not to feel too ill. Turkey coma kicked in about an hour later, and I ended up crawling into bed shortly after midnight.<br />
The next morning, it was my turn to cook. (I&#8217;d made this request from when it was suggested that I was coming to Nanton.) I&#8217;d been wanting to make my dad&#8217;s pancakes for years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t had them since Christmas of 2001, and was dying to have them again. So, with Erin&#8217;s family watching, I whipped up a batch of pancake batter, fried up some sausages (Erin&#8217;s mom made some really good bacon), and julienned a couple potatoes for hash browns.<br />
My poor stomach hadn&#8217;t recovered from dinner the night before.<br />
The sausages were thoroughly delightful, not the least of which was because they (like the turkey) were all-natural. Instead of fillers or sweeteners, there were cranberries. I&#8217;m certain the casings weren&#8217;t edible plastic, either.<br />
Having completely ruined my diet for about a month, Erin and I set up to head back to Calgary. Both of us had things to do, and while sticking around was a good thought, we readied to roll. But not without trucking back enough food for a small battalion.<br />
I love leftovers. Especially when it&#8217;s turkey.</p>
