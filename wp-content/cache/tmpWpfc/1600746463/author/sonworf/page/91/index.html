	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It seems that Critical Mass is losing too many good people within a very short period of time. First, it was a round of layoffs nearly three weeks ago. Now it&#8217;s a series of resignations. Among them is Arthur.<br />
Arthur came to Critical Mass about two months after I&#8217;d started. He&#8217;d moved into the interactive agency world after realizing that banking just wasn&#8217;t for him. He sat next to me in our old building. Starting off in QA, Arthur worked himself up to the point where he could switch into Web Development, where he did a variety of projects before landing on the Mercedes-Benz account.<br />
For at least two years, Arthur was the lead Web Developer on the Dealers projects, although last year he also ran the Web Development end of the Collection migration. In no case an easy job. He worked long hours when necessary, and never once complained about the job. Truly a model employee.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t work that defined him. It was being himself. He&#8217;s thoughtful, kind, caring, always willing to help, and will go out of his way to take on a challenge when he sees the opportunity. This is how Arthur came to be my coach and mentor for physical fitness. He&#8217;s the one who set me up with my program, changed my eating habits, and encouraged me to try different things and move ahead.<br />
And I wasn&#8217;t the only one who had seen this sort of thing in him. Many people at Critical Mass who have come to know Arthur over the last three and a half years would be sad to see him go. Which is why on Friday, we held a going-away party for him at Vicious Circle.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people showed up, but we&#8217;d pulled out well in excess of 50 people. We had three our four large tables at the club filled with folks. Well, all but one person in particular. Arthur was late. Somehow, I wasn&#8217;t particularly surprised that the guest of honour was running 45 minutes late.<br />
People came and went over the next few hours. Soon, we were down to a solitary table, harbouring Arthur, Angie, Pat, Colin, Reid, Jude, Rudy, John, and myself. Somewhere around midnight (I&#8217;m guessing), we opted to move to a different venue. So we were off in a few vehicles for what we call the No Name Lounge, a club near 17th Ave. and 14th St. that, quite literally, has no name. (It&#8217;s probably a numbered company for the purposes of liquor licenses, et al.)<br />
We&#8217;d been there once before for Rudy&#8217;s little send off before he&#8217;d vanished to the South Pacific for a month over Christmas. There were significantly more people inside this time around, but as was the case before, the music was stellar, and the venue loads of fun.<br />
Just after 1:30, we&#8217;d realized that we&#8217;d had enough for one night. Arthur, Rudy, and Jude had already vanished for the Cherry Lounge, but the rest of us were not to follow. Angie went home (Reid making sure she got there okay), while Pat, John, Colin, and I saddled up for the ride home.<br />
Dropping John off at his place, Pat, Colin, and I headed in search of sustinence. We were starving. A night of revelry and far too much beer for our own good (we were pretty much sober by this point, incidentally) brought us to the most popular eatery on 17th Ave. for those out partying: Wicked Wedge. A slice of a &#8220;Chief Wiggum&#8221; pizza and a small Coke did wonders for me &#8230; and probably not for my diet. (I was willing to make an exception.)<br />
Pat and I drove Colin up to his place in Rocky Ridge (pretty much most of the way to Cochrane), engaging in a bitch-fest the likes of which I haven&#8217;t been in for a very long time. The three of us are long-time Critical Mass veterans (except that Pat was laid off three weeks ago), so we&#8217;ve seen it all. Literally. And we know what&#8217;s good and what needs help.<br />
*Sigh* If only we ran things. (And while I&#8217;m dreaming about things I don&#8217;t really want, I&#8217;d like to be a famous movie star.)<br />
Pat dropped me off just after 3:00. The house was cold and dark. But I didn&#8217;t mind at all. I crawled into bed, curled up in a fetal position, and let the sleep of the wicked steal me away for a few hours. I just hope no-one else leaves anytime soon. I don&#8217;t think my body can take it.<br />
In a couple of weeks, Arthur leaves for Toronto. No more morning workout sessions. No more suggestions on how to improve. No more crack comments as he passes my desk. (Hmmm&#8230; suddenly, this isn&#8217;t looking like such a bad thing.) But such is life. You can&#8217;t get into a pattern for too long before something has to change.<br />
Take care, Arthur! I&#8217;m sure our paths will cross again.</p>

		<p>A year and a day ago (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/02/ymca-starting-exercise/">Starting exercise at the YMCA</a>), I made the decision to move from my slovenly-like appearance to something a little more healthy.<br />
I signed up at the Eau Claire YMCA, and started my exercise regimen. And for about six months, the only thing I really did was torture myself getting up at 5:20 in the morning. I had the right idea, but the wrong plan. This is where Arthur stepped in.<br />
Until the end of last week, Arthur was an employee of Critical Mass, a friend, and my gym coach. He&#8217;d get on my case if I failed to show up in the morning. He&#8217;d give me grief for eating the &#8220;wrong things&#8221;. He became determined to whip me into shape, even if it killed me.<br />

		<p>I hereby lodge as much a formal complaint to the final outcome of last night&#8217;s team building event as one can without a process by which to handle it. So I&#8217;m throwing it out on the Internet for all to see.<br />
But more on that in a minute &#8230; or five.<br />
This week, Critical Mass&#8217; first and still largest client, Mercedes-Benz USA, came up to the mind-numbingly cold Great White North of Calgary for Year 2004 planning meetings.<br />
Client meetings can go one of two ways: good, and horrible. I have the fortune, thus far, of never having had the latter. All of the client meetings have been good: productive, educational, if perhaps a little dry from time to time. But at the end of the day, you can walk off knowing that you&#8217;ve done a good job.<br />
I&#8217;ve been on the Mercedes account for over three years, now. Overall, it&#8217;s been a fairly good (albeit trying) experience. But in those three years, I hadn&#8217;t really met the client before. So walking onto the fourth floor, I ran into a lot of people I had never really met before.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s not entirely fair. I had &#8220;met&#8221; most of them during a previous visit, about this time last year (before I was promoted into the lead team). They came by on a tour, shook hands, I did a 30-second unprepared song and dance, they walked off. Now I had to remember their names and interact with them. (Not that is a bad thing in any way.)<br />
Wednesday was our first day of meetings. Eight o&#8217;clock in the morning until after five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. Straight. Wednesday night was the first event, which was a kind of cooking class. Can&#8217;t tell you anything about it, though. Wasn&#8217;t invited. (Although I&#8217;m a lead, apparently I&#8217;m not important enough to be considered for some things &#8230; the rel reason was due to too many people on the team, and that I don&#8217;t have direct contact with the client on a regular basis).<br />
The first activity of the day, though, was a team-building event. Basically, personality bingo. We had to go around the room and find things that people could do or have done (for example, who could drive stick shift or who had been to five countries).<br />
The next thing was a review of management types. We had all done a survey that produced our management strengths. The result is one of four &#8220;colours&#8221;: red (direct and to-the-point), green (extroverted), blue (planning), and yellow (structured). The idea is to focus on the strengths, and know how you communicate with other colours.<br />
I&#8217;m a blue, for the record. It&#8217;s characterized by taking time to get all the facts, understand the situation, and plan things out. Supposedly, one of the other characteristics is a long fuse (apparently, we can take a lot of crap); but when it burns out, run.<br />
At the time I saw that characteristic, I actually took a bit of offence. I used to be like that. Won&#8217;t deny it &#8212; can&#8217;t deny it. But I&#8217;ve taken great strides in keeping my temper in check. I would even go so far as to say that I&#8217;m a lot more laid back than I used to be.<br />
Thursday. Stories of the dinner the night before. More meetings. A little later of a start, but the same sort of results. The technology review got booted twice, and ultimately delayed until today (we&#8217;re just getting underway as I type this, and I wonder if we&#8217;ll be getting to it at all).<br />
The thing we looked forward to most, though, was the team event. This typically happens on the last night of a meetings. It&#8217;s always different, but almost always fun. I don&#8217;t know what they did last time, but a couple years ago they did the O-Lame-Pics, which was some combination of winter &#8220;sports&#8221;. This year was something different.<br />
At first, we were actually told we needed to bring snowpants. I have no idea why, but I can only guess there was something to do with, well, snow. (I know, took a real stretch of deduction.) That was changed when we were told that we would not be outdoors for more than seven minutes at a time. But we were not told what the event was. All we were told was to be in the Walker Room of the Hyatt hotel at 18:15.<br />
At about 18:30, the game was finally announced: The Amazing Freeze. Based on the reality show &#8220;The Amazing Race&#8221;, the idea was that we would run around downtown Calgary, doing various events and getting clues to the next event.<br />
Sounds pretty straight-forward, eh? Well, here&#8217;s something to really throw a wrench in your aspirations. We were &#8220;randomly&#8221; (I assume randomness, but have to really wonder) put into teams of 5-6 people. While most of the teams were a blend of Critical Mass and Mercedes-Benz USA employees. As was with mine. Except for one detail.<br />
Everyone else was from New York. I was the only one who had any idea of where these places were.<br />
The teams were named by model. We were Team SL500 (my favourite Benz, although I&#8217;ll never be able to afford one). There was Anne, our account manager in New York; Ed, who runs the Dealers program at Mercedes; Diane, who runs the Owners program at Mercedes; Lark, who is one of Mercedes IT&#8217;s representatives; and yours truly.<br />
We were handed knapsacks. In these knapsacks were bottles of water, a pad of paper, two taxi chits, a couple of pens, and an emergency phone number to call in the event you somehow got lost.<br />
As we had already been drinking when we were handed the bag, the logical thing to do was replace the bottles of water with bottles of beer and wine. (Hey, if you&#8217;re gonna run around downtown Calgary like maniacs, you might as well be loaded while doing it.)<br />
We then got our first clue. The entire group of about 25 people rushed out of the hotel en masse (I can only imagine what the other guests were thinking), dashing off to their first destinations. Three groups (including ours) ended up at the James Joyce. First challenge: sidle up to the bar, and suck back a few shots. Jim Beam. Blech.<br />
Next clue took us to the Calgary Tower. I started making the team run. I got caught up in the competition. This was a bit of a challenge, because Lark and Ed don&#8217;t run, Diane is a self-professed &#8220;lazy New Yorker&#8221;, and I had a little too much energy for my own good. We ran across red lights.<br />
A list of 10 questions, including the name of the building with a yellow plane in its lobby (the Petro-Canada Tower), the date Calgary became a city (1884), or what building was built for the 1983 Summer Games (the Lindsay Park facility, now known as the Talisman Centre, which had been the velodrome, I believe). Assuming you didn&#8217;t know the answers, you could find them by using four kiosks around the tower&#8217;s observation level.<br />
We ran a lot.<br />
Questions filled in, we caught the elevator back down. As we caught our breath, we had an Australian couple (I think they were Australian) take our team photo. In the spirit of the game, and because the shots had kicked in by that time, Lark offered the couple one of our bottles of beer.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen such a confused and bewildered look before in my life.<br />
Turning the question sheet over to the clerk at the desk (who had answered &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; when asked if he would help us with the question sheet), we received our next clue. It took a moment for me to figure out what it said (remember, the shots had kicked in), and we ran off to Winner&#8217;s to get a team &#8220;uniform&#8221; that could be purchased for CDN$60.<br />
The Winner&#8217;s staff were probably more confused than the couple in the elevator. All they knew was that there would be teams of people running through the store on some goofy quest. But first, we needed a team uniform. The team made a quick decision: socks. Really ugly ones. Ed was so enthusiastic, he ripped them from the racks, the little plastic clips flying everywhere. Ed ran back to the cashier, Diane apologising to the clerk for our haste.<br />
Right about then, Lark started telling the clerk (who was holding our clue envelopes) that she was with another team. Somehow, she got the CLK500 envelope. At this point, Diane and I got on the fairness bandwagon and decried Lark&#8217;s underhandedness, and made her hand it back.<br />
If we&#8217;d been thinking, we would have grabbed all the envelopes and scrambled the clues (they were all different). Oh well, lesson learned.<br />
Atrocious socks in hand, we were off to the Glenbow Museum. (Yes, running. Well, I was. The rest of the team, not so much.) We had a choice: either run through the Bog People exhibit (which I saw about a week and a half ago), or take the detour. The detour won, hands-down.<br />
The detour was simple, though: tie ourselves together with scarves, run out to Macleod Trail, and run back. The whole thing took about 30 seconds. We chanted like Marines as we jogged down the block and back. Next clue: Off to sushi.<br />
If there was one key mistake that we made, it was following the instructions and taking the C-Train. If we&#8217;d been thinking, we&#8217;d have taken a taxi. So we had to wait 10 minutes for a train to show up.<br />
But we sort of played the taxi angle. While the rest of us waited on the platform, Ed wandered out to the road to flag something down. He didn&#8217;t find a taxi, but managed to frighten some poor woman in a minivan (she locked her doors), tried to flag down one of Calgary Transit&#8217;s community busses, and almost stopped a police SUV.<br />
The train finally showed up, and we headed off to the 7th St. stop, at the other end of downtown. We were the last team to get to Sushi Hiro (but not because we were slow; that was just our last stop). We had to wait for the previous team to finish and leave.<br />
The game was a kind of fear factor: people had to eat sushi. Oh. My. Such fear. The longest part of the effort was laying claim to the sushi we wanted to eat. It disappeared in less time than we&#8217;d had to wait to eat it. (Lark pulled out the wine, and Ed cracked a beer &#8230; with his teeth, no less!) Back out the door, we started to flag down a cab, only to luck into having a cab be there, waiting. (It had been called by a previous team, and had been late arriving.) We were off to our final stop: Catch Restaurant.<br />
We didn&#8217;t use the taxi chits, Ed paid for the cab with cash. In the door, and up the stairs, we were the first team to arrive. We even had to find Eryn, who was more-or-less the ringleader of the whole event. The elation of being first, despite the odds that were against us, was outstanding.<br />
The rest of the teams started arriving. By the time we got back downstairs (we weren&#8217;t allowed upstairs yet, so had to wait in the Oyster Bar), the second team had arrived. It wasn&#8217;t long before most of the teams had finished, and we were allowed back upstairs.<br />
Tales from the teams&#8217; exploits were traded around. No-one had gotten lost, but we weren&#8217;t the only ones to make mistakes. One team actually walked to Sushi Hiro and back, which added a significant portion of time to their race.<br />
We sat down to dinner, which consisted of salad or clam and oyster chowder, haibut or beef, and a chocolate mousse cake. Very tasty.<br />
Awards for the teams were handed out, from last to first. Eryn added colour commentary, which was definitely playful. Everyone was having fun. At least until they announced the winner.<br />
A different team supposedly won. They weren&#8217;t even the second team to come through the door! I was dumbfounded! And it was because, of all things, because they&#8217;d had to wait for sushi, so they got a time bonus.<br />
Remember that long fuse? It burned out.<br />
Considering the difficulties our team faced, we should have been granted a lot more leniency. But no, somewhere a serious breech of the rules occured and the winning team didn&#8217;t actually win. To put it succinctly, we were robbed.<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m still steamed. We got a coffee mug. Much better than the little keychain light, teddy bear, or box of Smarties of the other teams (the &#8220;winning&#8221; team made off like kings), but it&#8217;s not the prize that&#8217;s at issue here! It&#8217;s the principle of the thing. We&#8217;d won, pure and simple. We followed the rules (despite Lark&#8217;s attempt at sabotage), and finished first. Why should we get penalized because another team had to wait for something out of their control?<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a game, Geoff, don&#8217;t take it so personally!&#8221;<br />
Yeah, yeah, I know. Considering all the things we had to, the excellent team building we had done, the &#8220;process&#8221; we&#8217;re supposed to be following (as a part of our jobs), and arriving first, all I wanted was to cheer our vistory. I couldn&#8217;t care less about winning anything. The fact that four Americans had to put their faith in a lone Canuck not to get them lost, come together as a team, and still complete the course before everyone else should garner the recognition. What else can I say? I got caught up in the competitivenes.<br />
Yeah, so this is my formal complaint. We won, darn it, and you can&#8217;t take that away from us. Take your fancy backpacks, I don&#8217;t care! (I have one, anyway.) I have the satisfaction that we are #1.<br />
Now before everyone thinks I&#8217;m too negative about all this, make no mistake: I had fun. A lot of fun. I would do it again in a second. It was planned wonderfully, executed brilliantly, and (outcome notwithstanding) an excellent idea for the event. I have to keep it in mind should I ever have to do this sort of thing again.<br />
But next time, I&#8217;m switching the envelopes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, David Bowie reminded us all how a concert should be done.<br />
Well, technically *last* night, but since it&#8217;s just after midnight as I write this, it&#8217;s still the same night. Anyway, you get the point.<br />
Tamara and I had planned this from several months ago (sometime in September or October), when we&#8217;d heard about an IMAX presentation of David Bowie&#8217;s new album, &#8220;Reality&#8221;. The two of us hussled down to the Paramount Chinook to score some tickets to watch the show. As it turned out, it was the best move we could make. As a result of that show, we&#8217;d found out that members of Bowie&#8217;s fan club had access to an Internet presale of tickets to his concert in Calgary.<br />
Within moments of getting home, Tamara had joined the club, and we had ordered tickets for us, Tamara&#8217;s parents, and a few of Tamara&#8217;s friends. But the choice tickets went to us.<br />
On the floor. In the eighth row. We&#8217;d be able to see Bowie&#8217;s *sweat*.<br />
Well, you can imagine the wait. It was long. Both of us wanted to see this show. For both Tamara and I, seeing David Bowie play is one of those (potentially) once-in-a-lifetime things. And unlike other acts who come and go, Bowie is a monolith in the industry &#8212; the one other acts look to. Elvis might have been the King, but it is the Thin White Duke who rules.<br />
The first time I&#8217;d heard David Bowie was in the early 80s. It was one song: &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;, from his &#8220;Let&#8217;s Dance&#8221; album. I don&#8217;t know what it was. Hook, line, and sinker. Since then, I&#8217;ve kept track of David&#8217;s career &#8212; not only his musical one, but also his acting (Bowie&#8217;s done several movies, including Jim Henson&#8217;s &#8220;Labyrinth&#8221; and &#8220;The Linguine Incident&#8221;). Ever since that first song, I&#8217;ve been a fan.<br />
We started the evening at Catch. I had given Tamara a gift certificate for Christmas, as she had regularly expressed her desire to eat there. I endulged (perhaps a little too much, but hey, it&#8217;s been a rough week). Unfortunately, we ended up running a little late, so we left without noticing that Tamara&#8217;s $50 certificate hadn&#8217;t, in fact, come off the bill. Something I&#8217;ll have to address in the morning.<br />
We grabbed a taxi to the Saddledome, arriving partway into Macy Gray&#8217;s opening act. (Bowie, if nothing else, knows that while the opening act should never be better than the headliner, it still needs to be solid.) My only regret of the evening (the gift certificate fiasco notwithstanding) was missing part of Macy Gray&#8217;s act.<br />
Arriving on the floor, we had to have someone guide us to our seats, not having a clue where they were. We figured we were off to the sides, which would have been fine for us. We just wanted to see the show. But the guide led us to the middle of the rows, eight away from the stage. Our seats were nearly dead-centre. We could see the individual hair fibres in Macy Gray&#8217;s afro.<br />
Tamara and I were damn near giddy with delight.<br />
Macy Gray is a solid performer. A bit of a freak, perhaps, but a total class act. And her band takes a great deal of pride in the work that they do. The result is an amazing show. I would gladly see Macy Gray again, should she swing around this area. (And a note to all of you who have yet to see David Bowie&#8217;s Reality show &#8212; don&#8217;t show up late! You won&#8217;t be disappointed.)<br />
The house lights soon came up, and the roadies began to set up for Bowie. Tamara disappeared for a while with her father (he and Tamara&#8217;s mother were a row behind us, about six seats to the right), returning about 10 minutes before the show with a tour book, and two drinks (I was the recipient of a free beer). And we waited.<br />
But we didn&#8217;t have to wait long. About 20:45, the music on the PA system changed, and suddenly you could hear David&#8217;s voice, and the band started playing. But no-one was on stage, and the lights hadn&#8217;t yet dimmed. The pixelboard behind the performer&#8217;s area came to life, showing an animated version of the band practicing. The lights started going out. The crowd was getting loud.<br />
It was time.<br />
One by one, David Bowie&#8217;s band started entering the stage. People whose names are usually forgotten were cheered loudly as they took their positions. There was a long pause from when the last one picked up their instrument until David walked out on stage, to deafening cheers and whistles. Without missing a single beat, they jumped right into what appears to be the opening song on the tour, &#8220;Rebel Rebel&#8221;.<br />
It was amazing. For the next two hours, David and his band flipped around over 35 years of music, switching from songs from his new album, to songs from his first, and almost every album in between. Ones you never heard of, ones that you heard yesterday, and ones that were great almost a generation ago. All but two or three, I knew or at least had heard once before.<br />
David Bowie isn&#8217;t just a singer-songwriter. He&#8217;s a performer. When he&#8217;s just singing, he&#8217;s acting. He&#8217;s making love to the audience because he wants to draw them into his world. For two hours, that&#8217;s precisely what happened. You were absorbed by his energy (I can only hope to look like him when I&#8217;m 57 years old), his passion, and his presence. He commanded without even having to really try.<br />
&#8220;Reality&#8221;, &#8220;New Killer Star&#8221;, &#8220;Fame&#8221;, &#8220;Under Pressure&#8221; (David&#8217;s bassist sings Freddie Mercury&#8217;s part amazingly well), &#8220;Life on Mars?&#8221;, &#8220;Ashes to Ashes&#8221;, &#8220;Heroes&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m Afraid of Americans&#8221; (which got a huge boost from the audience), &#8220;Ziggy Stardust&#8221;, and many others were all readily cheered. It was, without a doubt, one of the loudest concerts I&#8217;d been to &#8212; and not because of the band. (My ears are ringing, but I&#8217;ve been to louder, and much worse, concerts.)<br />
Early in the show, David decided that we&#8217;d done such a good job singing &#8220;All The Young Dudes&#8221;, that we could sing &#8220;China Girl&#8221; without him. The band started playing, but when the singing should have started, there wasn&#8217;t a peep from the audience (at least that you could hear). Bowie looked quite disgusted. He stopped the band, walked up to the mike, and announced:<br />
&#8220;That was fucking tragic.&#8221;<br />
He laughed with the rest of us, and then restarted the song, this time taking lead of the vocals. He seemed to like the audience participation. During his 5-6 song encore (I&#8217;m not sure exactly how many songs he did), he played a personal favourite: &#8220;Suffragette City&#8221;. There&#8217;s just nothing quite like hearing 13-odd thousand people all screaming: &#8220;Wham, bam, thank you, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; at the top of their lungs.<br />
There were two songs that I&#8217;d wanted to hear: &#8220;Space Oddity&#8221; and my personal favourite, &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;. According to his website, however, those songs haven&#8217;t appeared on any of his play lists. *Sigh* Well, if nothing else, it just gives me an excuse to see him the next time he&#8217;s anywhere in the area &#8230; which means most of this section of North America, of course.<br />
When the house lights came back on, it was hard to believe it was over. The energy had been amazing &#8212; we could have easily listened for another two hours. But it was almost 23:00, and time for most people to go home. (Some of us have to work tomorrow.)<br />
Tonight, David Bowie rocked Calgary. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of the Thin White Duke.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2004/01/critical-mass-new-year-2004/" rel="bookmark">The 2004 Critical Mass New Year Party</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every year, Critical Mass holds its annual holiday party. For the first two years of my employ, they were Christmas parties (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]); the two since then have both been New Year parties (see [[Critical Mass New Year Party 2003]] photos). I assume this is because scheduling things before Christmas is far more difficult. And really, it&#8217;s nice to have party that&#8217;s not heavily influenced by a holiday.<br />
Last year, we hung out at the Destination: Africa pavillion at the Zoo. A neat place, to be sure, but you can&#8217;t go to the same place twice in a row (if at all). So this year (and last night, to be specific), we opted for something different. It was a little more downplayed than last year &#8212; the Palomino Room at the Roundup Centre. Not exactly the Fairmont Palliser, but the venue wasn&#8217;t going to be the central point.<br />
Kristen and I arrived just as the event was beginning. We could have gone for the slightly more fashionably-late, but considering there was a hockey game and the motorcycle show both on that evening (not to mention other parties), I wanted to take advantage of the nearby parking at the office. Thankfully, we were not the first to show.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the theme of the evening was, but the focal point was money. As each person arrived, they were given an envelope that contained the ubiquitous drink tickets, and $20,000 in funny money for each person. (Kristen and I had a total of $40,000 between the two of us.) The funny money was for use at the gaming tables.<br />
The Lions Club provided the entertainment &#8212; several blackjack tables, a roulette table, and two other games that I really don&#8217;t know the name of, but generally don&#8217;t see outside of carnival midways. The idea of these tables was to turn your $20,000 into much more. This money would be used after the tables closed to bid on a wide range of prizes, including a carpet steamer, camera, kid&#8217;s play easel, coffee maker, power saw, and a monstrous George Foreman grill.<br />
We mingled near the door, getting a feel for the near-empty room. James bounded up from out of nowhere, already quite giddy. He, Scott, and Tyler were providing the music that evening, taking turns DJing. (I would believe their task to be wholly successful, but in discussing the aftermath with James earlier today, found that there were those who were less than impressed. To them, I can only feel pity, for not appreciating that these gentlemen volunteered their time. They sacrified their party time so that the rest would not suffer the consequences of the DJ we had last year.)<br />
James proceeded to note my demure behaviour, which while I did not take offense in, could not understand how he noticed so quickly, having only just arrived. We were then taken for a quick tour to the stage to view the setup for the evening. Most of what James said registered somewhere in the recesses of my mind, but only superficially &#8212; he was talking so fast I could barely understand him.<br />
Amy and Jen arrived soon thereafter, so the four of us (James remained on stage) took Table 15. We would be accompanied by Angie and Tyler, and Luke and Allison. With our things &#8220;stashed&#8221;, we proceeded to find out if we were lucky in cards.<br />
Neither Kristen or I had played blackjack before. And we were at a table with a dealer whose accent, unfortunately, was difficult to hear at times (over the music and other people). But we began to get the basics down. The principle is easy enough (closest to 21 without going over, and it&#8217;s the dealer vs. everyone else). For a while, we were up and down like yo-yos, before Kristen hit a big winning streak, which recovered all our lost funds, plus $1,000 &#8230; which was the smallest bill, by the way, so don&#8217;t think we were *that* successful.<br />
Dinner was called around 6:30 or so, which was an excuse to hit the lines. Of our table, we were the last to arrive. But at least the food was good. (Terri had warned me that Stampede Catering was not the best, so we apparently had tried to get another caterer. But only Stampede Catering will cater an event on the Stampede grounds.) Roast vegetables, potatoes, chicken, and a wonderful roast beef (with a wild mushroom gravy that I thought was wonderful). Hard to eat everything, though. Especially since we needed to save room for dessert.<br />
And were we glad we did. Now the chocolate wasn&#8217;t Bernard Callebaut (at least, I don&#8217;t believe it was), but it was still very tasty. The shocker for the night, however, was the baklava. Until last night, I wasn&#8217;t really a baklava fan. I&#8217;d had it before, but it hadn&#8217;t done anything for me. Kristen, however, could not get over how good it was. So I had to try. I was beside myself.<br />
I love chocolate. I mean, I *really* love chocolate. It&#8217;s one of my weaknesses. But this simple Greek pastry was like having someone open the door into a new world of taste experiences. I think the main ingredient was pure crack cocaine, because it was enough for Kristen and I to go back for seconds, thus eliminating the remainder of baklava from the table. (Yes, we were greedy. So sue me.)<br />
Following dinner, the gaming tables resumed with frenzy. Kristen and I tried our hands again at 21, only to find that our luck wasn&#8217;t as good as we&#8217;d thought. Finally, Kristen convinced me to try roulette &#8212; something Tamara would have loved, had she been able to come. I&#8217;d never played it before, though I knew the rules from having watched Tamara and Adrian on a couple of occassions.<br />
Like blackjack, roulette does involve some strategy, and you can do quite well, depending on how you place bets. Placing directly on the numbers the most risky, but has the highest payoff. Playing on the variations (colours, odd/even, number ranges) tends to reduce the risk. It took me a while to listen to my instinct and hope that we did well.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how much we were down when we started (we&#8217;d both had our clocks cleaned at the last blackjack table), but in the last spin of the roulette table before it closed, earned back enough money to have the original $40,000 restored. I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Several others did much better, going into the hundreds of thousands. But even that would not be enough for the bidding wars that were about to break out.<br />
With the gaming complete, the silent auction went into overdrive. The first table closed 30 minutes after gaming ended, so the bidding was fierce. The top price was $325,000 for the carpet cleaner. I was impressed &#8212; I didn&#8217;t think anyone could win so much. It was then that it dawned on us &#8230; not all the winnings were from one person.<br />
Pooling had begun. Deals were struck, begging was in full force. Eyes were locked on certain items, and the bids were rising fast. It was like watching an episode of &#8220;Survivor&#8221;. Soon, it was just the second table. Minimum bid? Somewhere around $200,000. Rumours of someone walking around with $5 million began to spread. False values were thrown around like rice at a wedding. Our paltry $40,000 was donated to the cause, so Luke could acquire the coffee maker of his dreams.<br />
Oddly enough, it would be the coffee maker that acquired the most attention, though for reasons I may never fully understand. In the waning seconds of the bidding, the war went to extremes, with people turning over huge sums of cash to a select few still engaged in the fight. When the ball dropped and the bidding closed, the final values were unbelievable. The coffee maker drew the biggest bid of the night, almost doubling that of the professional-looking George Foreman grill.<br />
Final bid: $1 million.<br />
All I can say is, that had better be one damn fine cup of coffee.<br />
The wars over and the dust settled, there were a few announcements, and James began his run at the turntables. Some people stayed at danced, some headed out. We stuck around for about 45 minutes or so, before we, too, headed out. Normally, I would shut the party down. For once, I wasn&#8217;t really upset about leaving early.<br />
It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what they can plan for next year.</p>

		<p>First off, Happy New Year everyone!<br />
2003 was quite a year &#8212; quite a few good things, and a number of bad ones. In fact, not a lot of good ones, worldly-speaking, that is. Although not all the &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; lists are out yet, the ones that are on the Internet are (not surprisingly) mostly negative. Lots of death and tragedy, with the odd curling win to make things brighter. Let&#8217;s just hope this year comes with a little less strife than the year past.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I slept fitfully. I don&#8217;t really know why. But when I awoke Christmas morning, there was a slight sense of excitement. Perhaps I&#8217;d been depressed the day before and not taken notice. (The reason why, of course, still remains a mystery.) It&#8217;s just as easy to believe that there was nothing special about this day, nothing more than the same dull drudgery I feel that I face more often than I care to admit to.<br />
I showered, shaved, and dressed for the day. I would not return until after Christmas dinner, so the objective was to look as presentable as possible, without being uncomfortable all day long. Fed the cat, and hopped in my car for Brenda and Mike&#8217;s. I was to be there for 9:00, so we could begin Christmas morning.<br />
Mom and Nana were running a little late, but not so much that the entire day was thrown out of whack. They arrived not long after me, and with mimosas and/or coffee in hand, we proceeded to the living room. There were six of us, and more than enough presents all around. We even had stockings, despite protests that we didn&#8217;t really need them.<br />
Inside, the slight excitement grew. Unfortunately, the feeling was a little sickening, becase it felt materialistic. I didn&#8217;t want to receive gifts so much as I wanted to give them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I like receiving gifts as much as the next person, but the acquisition of materials goods just isn&#8217;t the driving force for me that used to rule my early childhood. The anticipation, however &#8212; that I will never miss.<br />
Jen got a digital camera, one she has to share with Brenda. The key reason is that so Jen will have it when she goes to Japan with me in late March. It will be an experience of a lifetime, and she needs to record every event. Mike and Jen played with it most of the morning &#8230; no, I take that back &#8212; most of the day. Mom received a personal chef service from the family, and a foot massager from Cathy, Craig, and myself. Brenda received some nice clothes, as did Nana. Mike made off with a Belgian beer selection.<br />
As for me, I got a good book on the Canadian Pacific Railway (&#8220;Stand Fast, Craigellachie!&#8221;), a pocket watch with an engraved train, funds for landscaping the house, movies, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, and a cuckoo clock. The clock, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a Mini-brand product. Every hour, instead of a little bird, a little red car pops out of its little doors, revs its engine, and beeps its horn. Cathy couldn&#8217;t resist getting it for me. I could barely stop giggling.<br />
The video game (&#8220;Grand Theft Auto&#8221;) came from Tamara, my roommate. This had been a trying year for us. Tamara was laid off from Critical Mass in June. In lieu of her having to move out, I just didn&#8217;t ask for rent. Until she was contracted back (for five months!), Tamara didn&#8217;t pay rent. I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; why would I do that? Simple: It&#8217;s far harder to find a perfect roommate than it is to lose money. Considering how well we get along, the last thing I needed was for her to have to move out. With her contract now expired, that is a possibility, but one I hope won&#8217;t come soon. Tamara and I both know the situation, and how it makes the other person feel. Tamara&#8217;s card, despite being aimed at young children, made me cry.<br />
Breakfast followed, as did my traditional butt-whipping at video games. (Jen usually creams me on the game of choice.) By 15:00, it was time to head up to Nana&#8217;s. We had to prepare for dinner.<br />
When Nana had moved into her complex, she had immediately made arrangements for us to use the Family Dining Room for our great family feast. While all fine and dandy, this did pose a couple of logistical problems, most notably the cooking of the turkey. (In fact, this simple thing created what I can only describe as the first great family feud in my memory. In the end, Uncle David took over turkey preparation, while Mom and Brenda just fumed about the whole situation.) Seating arrangements weren&#8217;t too difficult to sort out.<br />
The feud did not continue when everyone arrived. Instead, we prepared dinner, with everyone chipping in for details (moving furniture, making parts of the meals, grabbing things from Nana&#8217;s room). By 17:45, we were all seated around the massive table, eating. It was the earliest I can ever remember having Christmas dinner.<br />
Following the meal, and before we all partook of dessert, Uncle David presented a slide show. They were old photos of the family from the 1940s and 1950s, when the &#8220;children&#8221; (namely, Mom, David, and Brenda) were still young. Some of the slides were creepy &#8212; there were two where we were all convinced the subject was Cathy, not Mom.<br />
By 21:00, the Family Dining Room looked like we hadn&#8217;t even been there. Everything was cleaned, packed up, and on its way back out to the cars. We grouped together in a room just off the lobby, overlooking the complex&#8217;s dining room, for a family photo. Darren, Jen, and I all took ones with our digital cameras. I wish I&#8217;d brought my larger one &#8212; it can handle the zoom a lot better than my small one.<br />
I was back at the gym bright and early the next morning. I had a very high calorie dinner to try and burn off. I didn&#8217;t get through a lot of it, because I had to be at Pam&#8217;s for 10:30 for brunch. It was the collection of families that had been at the Hovey&#8217;s two nights earlier (see [[It Just Doesn&#8217;t Feel Like Christmas Eve]]), just a different venue. Pam and crew had been preparing breakfast for some time. We mingled until the breakfast bell was rung, and it was time to eat. I have gotta get the recipe for Pam&#8217;s mediterranean breakfast dish. Very tasty.<br />
During breakfast, an idea crept through my little head. It&#8217;s Friday, and I want to go see a matinee. Specifically, &#8220;The Last Samurai&#8221;. It dawned on me that Jen had probably not seen it. Sure enough, she hadn&#8217;t. I proposed a plan to relieve Mike and Brenda of their daughter for the afternoon, doing some shopping down at A&amp;B Sound (the two of us had gift certificates to take care of), and then see the movie. All parties were in favour.<br />
A&amp;B Sound was far from packed, but we&#8217;d also long-missed the door crasher specials they&#8217;d had when the doors opened at 7:00 that morning. Fortunately, the discounts on white- and red-tagged prices were still in effect. It also meant we could get through the store without constantly bumping into people, and not spend forever in the checkout line.<br />
Dumping our new-gotten goods in the car, we headed over to Eau Claire Market for the movie. Having a little time before the movie, we endulged in some games in the adjacent arcade. Either Jen was having an off day, or was being merciful. I won all three games of air hockey, a fighting game (Marvel vs. Capcom, if memory serves me right) that I had no idea how to play or what was going on, and a racing game that really wasn&#8217;t that good anyway. Jen still served me my heiny on a platter in Soul Caliber 2, though.<br />
Popcorn and pop in hand, we sat down for the movie. A long one, too. But an interesting one. Not everyone is a fan of Tom Cruise, but he does a very good job in this movie. The short explanation is that it&#8217;s about a civil war veteran who ends up in Japan during the Meiji Reformation to train Japan&#8217;s new army in modern weapons. He&#8217;s captured by the &#8220;enemy&#8221; (a group of samurai) and learns about the way of the warrior &#8212; something he&#8217;d lost while fighting in America. Knowing something of Japanese history, it was quite interesting to see, and I wonder how accurate it might really be.<br />
Returning to the Znack&#8217;s, we had leftovers from last night&#8217;s dinner. Just not quite so much. I didn&#8217;t stay too late, though, as I had laundry to tackle &#8212; I&#8217;m running out of clean clothes.<br />
Besides, it gave me a great excuse to watch the movies I got for Christmas.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8216;Tis the night before Christmas,<br />
and all through the house,<br />
the cat is sound sleeping,<br />
as I sit here with my mouse.<br />
No stockings are hung<br />
by a chimney with care,<br />
just thrown in the laundry bin<br />
&#8216;cuz I have more to wear<br />
No children are nestled<br />
all snug in their beds,<br />
The only visions I see<br />
are of oncoming dread.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already noticed, I&#8217;m a little down this Christmas. I mean, it&#8217;s Christmas Eve, and I&#8217;m sitting in front of my computer, wondering what all the hulabaloo is about. When I was a kid &#8212; heck, even two years ago (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]) &#8212; Christmas meant something. It was an occasion. As I sit here in front of my computer, it&#8217;s just a day, no different than any other.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas. Maybe because there was no lead-in, no real build-up. It&#8217;s just &#8220;here&#8221;. Sure, I went to the malls &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t have missed the Christmas decorations if you were Helen Keller. But that&#8217;s not Christmas to me. My mother is here, as is a large portion of my family. Cathy and Craig are back in Oakville, and my Aunt Ruth and cousins Erica and Lauren are in the Toronto area. But is it their presence I miss?<br />
Last year was my first Christmas in Calgary. I have family here &#8212; I didn&#8217;t really miss anything. But is it that? Is that what I am missing? Not just my family here &#8212; but *all* of my family? I don&#8217;t know. Sure, it&#8217;s the second Christmas in a row without Cathy. Without my immediate family. It&#8217;s also the second Christmas without Dad. No loud Christmas music, no massive amounts of decorations, none of the usual triggers one would expect for this season.<br />
At least, none for me. There are plenty of other people looking forward to tomorrow. But not me. It&#8217;s just another day, just one where I don&#8217;t have to work. I think, if anything, I&#8217;m a little depressed. It&#8217;s too easy to lose touch with the things you need or want. It&#8217;s not about possessions &#8212; it&#8217;s about feeling. And maybe this year, I&#8217;m not feeling up to snuff.<br />
Earlier this year, I started dating someone for the first time since arriving in Calgary. While we are no longer together (we are friends), that experience awoke a number of things within me that I hadn&#8217;t felt in a long time. I suppose it&#8217;s wholly possible that some of these feelings are contributing to the problems I&#8217;m having. It could be that I&#8217;m incapable of enjoying Christmas this year because of that.<br />
But admittedly, I don&#8217;t really know. All I do know is that it doesn&#8217;t feel like Christmas to me. And I can only hope that the feeling is short-lived. I don&#8217;t want to go through the rest of my life feeling like this every December 25th.<br />
But don&#8217;t worry, I didn&#8217;t spend my time at home this evening. Tonight, we went out to visit with Aunt Alaine&#8217;s family, who are holding court out in Chestermere, about 20 kms east of Calgary along Hwy 16 (aka Trans Canada Highway). It&#8217;s a short drive, not far from my Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike&#8217;s &#8230; or would be, if we had proper directions.<br />
Getting to Chestermere is easy, don&#8217;t get me wrong. What&#8217;s not so easy? Finding the right house. Why is this so difficult? Because we neglected to get the address, or directions once inside Chestermere before we left the house. This left us circling the endless labyrinth of streets in a vain search for the Hovey residence.<br />
Jen and I got frustrated. While everyone else seemed content to say &#8220;Oh! *This* is the right street!&#8221;, we were content to grab the cell phone, call the house, and announce that we were lost and needed directions. (I was a bit snarky about it, too &#8212; probably a result of the aforementioned frustration.)<br />
Unlike previous excursions to the Hovey&#8217;s (at Easter &#8212; see [[Easter in Calgary, Visiting with Friends, Eating Russian Food]], my family would not be the only ones in attendance. The Tisdales were already in attendance, as were the various relatives on Alaine&#8217;s side of the yard. Several &#8220;kids&#8221; (namely, those a lot younger than I). Luckily, I get along well with the rest of the adults.<br />
We left shortly after 22:00, returning to Calgary. After a brief stop at Brenda and Mike&#8217;s, I drove Mom and Nana to Nana&#8217;s complex, where I swapped the van for my car (left at the complex when we&#8217;d done a run up earlier in the day). In a few short hours, I will be back at Chez Znack for Christmas Day.<br />
Something that, for what seems to be the first time in my life, I couldn&#8217;t care less about.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>
