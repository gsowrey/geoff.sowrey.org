		<p>[[All work and no play make Geoff something something|I used to drive.]]<br />
Then I realized that I should switch to something more environmentally friendly, and I could use the exercise to tone my otherwise sedentary ass. So I started biking.<br />
Biking was great. Fifteen minutes to work (mostly downhill), about 25 coming home (mostly uphill and in rush hour). Generally good. Except for the increase in leg mass that is causing issues with wearing pants (legs don&#8217;t fit anymore).<br />
It started getting darker (and colder). After a couple of near-misses with cars, I felt it was too dark to ride safely. So I switched to the bus.<br />
Makes sense &#8212; the #7 passes about a block from my house. Dumps me off about two blocks from the office. Runs every 15 minutes. You&#8217;d think that it would work well.<br />
Except that [[Calgary Transit Sucks]].<br />
And it kept getting worse. To the point where I was spending nearly two hours commuting. Driving takes 30 minutes.<br />
So I&#8217;m back to driving. There just seems no alternative.<br />
Damn.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of the many joys of homeownership is the clogged kitchen sink. This is not my first clogged kitchen sink, [[Visit to Ontario, Clogged up Kitchen Sink Drain|having worked through such an experience with my father a number of years ago]].<br />
I should point out that the event did not make me an expert, just made me aware of what not to do.<br />
First thing not to do: pour sulphuric acid down the pipes, and hope that it somehow dissolves the gunk that&#8217;s down there. Even moreso: not to blow into the pipe in hopes of forcing it down, only to have it come back up to splash on your pants and dissolve the fabric while you&#8217;re still in them.<br />
Still, about two litres of Draino didn&#8217;t help. It poured in, but the drain didn&#8217;t really unclog. Finally, desperate measures were needed. Not a plumber &#8212; a snake.<br />
The snake is a long metal &#8230; um &#8230; well &#8230; thing. If you&#8217;ve seen one, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. If you haven&#8217;t, then I suggest a short trip to your nearest rental store to ask about one. It&#8217;s about the easiest thing I can think of.<br />
The snake was a 25 footer, which I hoped would be enough to find it&#8217;s way to the clog. I figured that the clog had to be at the drain stack, where the drain would ultimately head vertically into the sewer.<br />
A note about using a snake: Use gloves. Preferably ones you don&#8217;t care about. Because those snakes have been <em>everywhere</em> and they are <em>disgusting</em>. My hands were turned a greasy brown. I chose to believe it was actually grease, and not something else that you normally find down a drain. (At least it didn&#8217;t smell.)<br />
With a bit of help from Alex, we managed to get the sucker down the drain, find the clog, and poke a hole in its formerly impenetrable defenses to allow the drain to &#8230; well, drain.<br />
And I still have my pants!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in August, Alex and I celebrated our paper anniversary, the first. We&#8217;d celebrated by going to Banff and spending the night at the Banff Springs hotel, having a wonderful dinner (note: chocolate fondue is wonderful, but uncomfortably filling), and attending the Mozart on the Mountain concert in Canmore.<br />
As part of our paper anniversary, I gave Alex tickets (paper) to the next Cirque du Soliel show, called Delirium.<br />
We&#8217;ve seen Cirque before in Calgary, earlier when we were dating (see [[Stampede Breakfast, Topmade Barbecue, and Quidam]]). I&#8217;ve also seen Cirque in Vegas (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]) and a couple of other minor times (and off-shoot troupes) in and around Ontario. In short, there was no reason not to get good tickets the moment they went on sale.<br />
The kicker was that Alex knew that Cirque was coming, and kept bugging me to get tickets. I stalled repeatedly and played stupid (I do it rather well, admittedly; comes from being naturally idiotic) and managed to keep her unaware that the tickets were, in fact, already purchased. So when the time came, it was a wonderful little surprise.<br />
We had good seats. Not floor, but really darn close. Close enough that we could almost hear people on the stage (I thought I could, but given the clarity of the sound system it was sometimes hard to tell).<br />
It was a weird show, unlike any previous Cirque show I&#8217;ve seen. This could largely be due to Franco Dragoni having left to do his own thing, and his protégés having taken over. The stage was long and thin, with &#8220;backstages&#8221; on either end. The entire stage couldn&#8217;t have been more than about six metres wide. Each side could be &#8220;draped&#8221; with a long curtain, which was translucent. You could see through the curtains to the other side. This gave a more ethereal look and allowed for projection onto the stage environment.<br />
The show was far more musical than previous shows, and made even less sense than Cirque shows usually make. (Yes, it&#8217;s about the power of dream and imagination, a common theme, but I was still scratching my head to make out some sort of overall plot device.)<br />
The first act was a solo singer who performed with members of the Cirque troupe. It&#8217;s hard to pin down the style (other than being Cirque-like) using Gaelic and Arabic lyrics, by the sounds of it. Active, invigorating, and sold us on a CD during the intermission.<br />
The main show started shortly thereafter. Lots of acrobatics, drums, strange instruments, people hanging from the rafters and a weirdo on stilts (again, typically Cirque). The neat thing was all the video that is shown on the screens that drift across the stagefront every so often.<br />
But no clowns.<br />
Overall, totally worth the price of admission. I love Cirque du Soliel. They&#8217;re always worth watching, even if it&#8217;s not one of their big, extravagant Vegas shows.<br />
Hmm. Which reminds me. I do need to revisit Vegas sometime to catch the other shows I haven&#8217;t seen&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve used video conferencing before. It was a novelty. Nothing fancy. There, but didn&#8217;t think much of it.<br />
Until today.<br />
Critical Mass recently got a Polycom video conferencing unit in the Calgary office. (There are matching units in Chicago and Toronto.) We&#8217;ve started using it with my current client for the weekly status meetings.<br />
The client is in Geneva. The video conference makes them seem like they&#8217;re in the same room.<br />
It&#8217;s trippy. It&#8217;s not the best quality and the lag is a little weird, but you get to see everything. Every facial movement (well, that the resolution lets you see, anyway), the mannerisms, everything. And because you can see yourself, it&#8217;s also makes you very self-conscious. Also trippy.<br />
Our client is eight time zones and over 12 hours of flying away. And our one hour of overlap a day keeps us somehow connected over a simple IP-based video connection.<br />
Technology really does make a difference at times.</p>

		<p>Space. The Final Frontier.<br />
Forty years ago today, a little under six years before I was born, Star Trek took to the air for it&#8217;s original three-year run before being cancelled. It would spawn off an animated series, comic book series, toys, four spin-off television series, 10 movies, and more parodies than you could shake a tribble at.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t know the first time I watched Star Trek in any form, though I&#8217;m relatively sure it was TOS (The Original Series). I know I was an addict for the entire run of TNG (The Next Generation). From there, I progressed to DS9 (Deep Space 9), Voyager, and finally the too-short-lived Enterprise series. Following TNG, my addition tempered and waned, especially as many of the episodes seemed to have lacklustre writing and stints of not-so-great acting. (Yes, it can be argued that none of the series had great acting as a whole. Particularly when it comes to asking what &#8230; have you done &#8230; with &#8230; Spock&#8217;s brain?!)<br />
&#8220;Trekkie.&#8221; The word evokes four possible responses: Laughter, ignorance, revulsion, acceptance. Some know what a trekkie is and merely laugh at the idea. There are those who have no idea what a trekkie is. There are those who do know and thoroughly object to being considered a &#8220;trekkie&#8221;, staunchly preferring &#8220;trekker&#8221;. And there are those who like the idea (and the connotations) that come with the epithet.<br />
I was a trekkie. (Note the past-tense.) I considered those who wanted to be called &#8220;trekkers&#8221; to be far too pretentious for their own good. I was all for the campiness, the humour, the perceived silliness that comes out. I went to Star Trek conventions (two, to be exact &#8212; one in Toronto and another in Buffalo). I had the pins, knew most of the characters, all the TNG episodes, could recite most of The Wrath of Khan by heart. And I wasn&#8217;t ashamed about it, either.<br />
Somewhere along the line &#8212; once I&#8217;d graduated university, it seems &#8212; I&#8217;d began a long, slow decline in my trekkiness. Today, I&#8217;d consider myself having turned my card back, no longer allowed to consider myself one amongst the crowd. &#8220;Reformed&#8221;, &#8220;ex&#8221;, &#8220;former&#8221; &#8212; pick a euphimism. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still love Star Trek in its various forms (although Voyager&#8217;s &#8220;reset button&#8221; habit still ticks me off), I just don&#8217;t devote a significant portion of my brain to it anymore. I&#8217;ve got a variety of other things to cram in there.<br />
Like generally useless trivia. It&#8217;s part of being a know-it-all.<br />
But you have to give Star Trek something. Despite all the wacky behaviour with fanatics, the show has done a surprising amount of good. Well, maybe &#8220;good&#8221; is subjective. It breathed life into the entire nearly-dead science fiction genre and gave rise to Star Wars, among other things. It also kindled new interest in science itself, creating several generations of scientists, physicists, explorers, and astronomers.<br />
The creator is gone. Gene Roddenbury died when I was in university. DeForrest &#8220;Bones&#8221; Kelly followed a few years later. James &#8220;Scotty&#8221; Doohan passed into the final frontier last year. Forty years takes its toll. They may be gone, but the legacy will live on. Maybe even to the 23rd century.<br />
Live long, and prosper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A year ago, I got married. Something that until a couple of years ago, I never thought I&#8217;d do. I&#8217;d been bitten hard, and I couldn&#8217;t do it. Couldn&#8217;t even imagine it. It takes the right person, and the right situation, to make something like marriage seem feasible, even exciting. And until a couple of years ago, I don&#8217;t think I was even mentally ready for it. It&#8217;s a big commitment, one that many people don&#8217;t really appreciate. It&#8217;s just a &#8220;thing to do&#8221;. Witness the divorce rate&#8230;<br />
Today is the first anniversary. We&#8217;ll be going to Mozart in the Mountain, the first concert of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s season. (Obviously, I&#8217;m writing this entry in advance.) I&#8217;m also arranging a night at the Banff Springs Hotel as a sort of celebration. Hopefully it all goes well. But this entry isn&#8217;t about this year&#8217;s anniversary. I want to tell you a story about my wedding, and how things don&#8217;t always go as planned. To set the stage, I give you two words:<br />
Food poisoning.<br />
This all started on the Tuesday before, 23 August 2005. Exactly how, I can&#8217;t tell you. Not because I don&#8217;t want to, but because I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve talked about this endlessly trying to figure out exactly what happened. All I do know is that I ingested <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter">Campylobacter jejuni</a></em>, a rather nasty gut bug that takes a few days to incubate and do its thing. There are a couple of possibilities, but nothing that I would consider conclusive. When when you&#8217;re &#8220;best friend&#8221; happens to be Murphy, you know that it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; you were going to get it anyway.<br />
Skip ahead to Friday, the 26th. My friends Stuart and Therese were in town for the wedding with their daughter, and we&#8217;d all gone out to Chilliwack to have dinner with my family at a cabin they&#8217;d rented. Clams, mussels, and steak. At the time, we were waiting for news of Teak picking Chris up from the airport (having flown in from Japan) and we would all meet at the Mission Best Western, where Therese and Stuart were staying.<br />
It took a while for Chris and Teak to get back. Teak took a few wrong turns in Vancouver (which is very easy if you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going) and they ended up having to stop for dinner along the way. Stuart and I ended up waiting in the hotel&#8217;s restaurant/bar (Therese baby-sat, under the intention of swapping with Stuart once Chris arrived).<br />
Around 23:15, I decided it might be necessary to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;d only had 1/2 of a bottle of beer, though plenty other liquids (I had a bit of a headache, but nothing I&#8217;d consider bad). When I stood up, I knew something was wrong. There was that twinge of nausea that suggested something was amiss, and I <em>really</em> needed to go to the bathroom.<br />
When Chris and Teak finally arrived just after midnight, my head was swimming. I couldn&#8217;t see straight without a lot of effort. There was no way I was going back to Chilliwack that evening (I was supposed to stay with my family). I begged Teak and Chris to crash in their hotel room. I managed to (somehow) drive back to their place in Maple Ridge (about 20 minutes) without causing an accident. I pulled out my sleeping back, curled up on the floor, and proceeded to suffer a tired, awkward, sweaty, and painful half-sleep until my alarm went off at 7:00 the next morning.<br />
By that point, I&#8217;d made a few trips to the bathroom. None of them were to vomit, thankfully, but every trip just reinforced that something was wrong. Teak&#8217;s Advil didn&#8217;t bring much relief. The pressure of the things that needed to be done before 13:00 however, allowed me to concentrate on other things. That, and a stop to the 7-11 along the way to pick up Gatorade seemed to help a bit.<br />
While Alex was getting her hair done (I hadn&#8217;t seen her since early-afternoon the day before), I ran around setting up tables, arranging placements, getting chairs into their locations. Teak and Chris had graciously loaned me their time to help decorating, though we didn&#8217;t really need a lot of it. Mostly just to hide the rather unattractive corners of the tent.<br />
An early-morning call to the bakery had discovered that our order for cupcakes would be ready for 15:00 &#8230; two hours <em>after</em> when we actually needed them. My head still swimming, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to hear that, and strongly suggested that they recheck their schedule, as I was to pick them up around 11:00, and I could only afford the trip into Abbotsford once. After a few minutes of discussion, they assured me it would be ready on time.<br />
My gut started to feel a little like a saltwater taffy puller. Things were moving, and it wasn&#8217;t comfortable. I hadn&#8217;t eaten much to speak of, but hunger was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted was to have the day go off without a hitch. While Chris and Teak toiled away with their decorating, I headed to the bakery to get our cupcakes.<br />
By the time I&#8217;d arrived back, guests were already in attendance. I was in grubby clothes, unwashed hair and unshaven. Not to mention feeling wholly gross from the exploding infection in my bowels. And to top it all off, the two wait staff that we&#8217;d hired promptly asked where they could find the ice.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten the ice.<br />
After the fastest trip yet seen from the house to the corner store and back, I retreated to the basement to try and get ready. I figured a hot shower would help. All it did was call out to the dull ache in my lower back. The shave was like scraping nerve endings. I looked like I hadn&#8217;t slept in a week. I suited up nonetheless, determined not to let some lousy, stupid illness put an end to something that we&#8217;d been planning for months. Ache or no ache, the show had to go on.<br />
Everyone seemed to notice immediately that I wasn&#8217;t feeling up to scratch. But most people &#8212; including my lovely wife-to-be &#8212; were convinced that it was only &#8220;nerves&#8221;. I humoured them and went along with it, but knowing full well the difference between nerves and illness. For the most part, it wasn&#8217;t too bad, I was able to work with what we had, mingling and wandering around, before we actually went into wedding mode. Tie and jacket added, we started the service.<br />
Like most things in our wedding, it was largely unplanned. We had an approximate idea of what we needed, but we didn&#8217;t rehearse (no need to) and didn&#8217;t know how long it would take Paul to go through the speeches. In reality, I have no idea how long the service actually went. All I do know is that the shoes (new) combined with a lot of standing and the seemingly full-on assault to my inner abdomen was wreaking havoc with my back. Spasms periodically shook through my spine and it was everything to bite my tongue and tell Paul to move it along a bit quicker.<br />
To this day, Alex still says I didn&#8217;t enjoy my day. It wasn&#8217;t that I hated it, far from it &#8212; weddings are meant to be wonderful days, and we&#8217;d planned ours in that way on purpose. But I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as her. I couldn&#8217;t eat. I couldn&#8217;t drink. I couldn&#8217;t think clearly. I didn&#8217;t get to partake of all the mingling that I&#8217;d wanted to. Taking the photographs afterwards was almost torture. I looked for every opportunity to sit down. In fact, one of my favourite pictures of us was when we were seated, and I was resting my head on Alex&#8217;s shoulder from sheer exhaustion. It looks angelic in print, even if it belies the torture going on underneath.<br />
The lack of clarity of thought really cut out a few things that I would have liked to do, namely get pictures of myself with those in attendance. As such, we have very little with those who came from afar. It&#8217;s my only regret of the day. The event wrapped up around 18:00 with people heading out into the evening. When most people had left, I headed back downstairs to get myself out of my suit and into something that felt less restrictive. The bed in the room I was changing in looked so inviting that I just couldn&#8217;t resist laying down for a moment.<br />
Alex found me there, passed out. When I awoke, the room spun in wild circles, like a midway ride gone wrong. I had to shut them almost immediately to prevent nausea. Alex let me rest another 30 minutes before we left for our hotel room in Langley. The trip there was hell. Every bump in the road sent pains up my body. Even the cool breeze didn&#8217;t help to clear anything. A card that Chris gave me sent me bawling from emotional overload. Though only a 30-minute trip, even 30 seconds was too long to get there.<br />
The running joke of the wedding night is this: hot and sweaty, without a lot of sleep. And that was just me.<br />
Despite a hot bath and almost having to call the biohazard disposal team from what had escaped from me (again, no vomiting), I still fired up the furnace of illness, actually forcing Alex to sleep at the far edge of the bed from me. It was too hot, even for her. The opposing chills that came were equally intolerable.<br />
The next morning I actually felt marginally better. I ate for the first time in almost a day and a half &#8212; a carrot muffin &#8212; before we headed out for our honeymoon. The idea had originally been to drive to Fairmont, a drive of about nine hours. But that had been scrapped even before my illness, when we realized that it was just unrealistic. Revelstoke seemed much better for our first leg. But even though I felt good enough to drive, we didn&#8217;t even make it as far as the Coquihalla Toll Booth. My system was going down again. Thirty minutes from Kamloops, my hips felt like they were imploding, my legs wouldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
They say married men live longer than single men. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re married, it&#8217;s because single men don&#8217;t have someone to force them to go to hospital when something&#8217;s wrong.<br />
For the record, the Royal Inland Hospital is a very nice facility that offers some really decent healthcare. They triaged me right away, including a bracelet and a urine test. I had to wait only a few minutes to get a bed, my own heart monitor (and blood oxygen monitor), and a nurse that checked in on me to get more information about how I was feeling. Alex was more distracted by all the gadgets in the curtained area than about me at this point &#8212; the problems with marrying someone in the health care industry&#8230;<br />
The trouble really came when the doctor came in. A decent fellow, he thought maybe the shellfish could be culprit, but he seemed doubtful. He carried out a conversation fairly nonchalantly, repeating most of the same topics the nurse had covered not long before. He was so smooth about it that he almost managed to get me to miss the blood test and IV he wanted to put me on.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already heard, I don&#8217;t like needles. I hate them. Loathe them. Despise them. And now he wanted to put something in me not for a few moments, but a few <em>hours</em> to &#8230; do something (I didn&#8217;t ask what). I immediately started reacting by suggesting that there must be some other way. The doctor, wisely, looked at my new wife for support. She just looked at me, smiled, and softly said: &#8220;Suck it up, buttercup!&#8221;<br />
For the record, it was the best thing that could happen. Blood tests ain&#8217;t my thing, and while I didn&#8217;t dig the IV (having to take it down the hall to the toilet to deliver the ol&#8217; poop-in-a-hat test was something I never thought I&#8217;d have to do one day), I felt immeasurably better for having taken the two litres of saline. The majority of my issues were due to dehydration, and this was the best way to get me back on track.<br />
The doctor also informed us that the bacterial infection could potentially spread through body fluids, so we had to keep our respective distance for a few days. On our honeymoon, no less. The ultimate torture for newlyweds. But at least the cramping was gone and I didn&#8217;t have any relapses. It wasn&#8217;t until I got back to Calgary that I found out what I&#8217;d actually had (not the shellfish, that much was certain). Source unknown, but culprit found.<br />
One day, down the road, we&#8217;ll probably get remarried. Something fun, simple, and easy. And hopefully free of nasty bacteria.</p>

		<p><em>Sigh.</em><br />
Just when I thought <a href="http://www.decloak.com/Dev/CSSTables/CSS_Tables_01.aspx">this topic was in the past</a>, to be revisited in the same manner as when historians look at how the Black Plague ravaged Europe. But no, it&#8217;s back. I&#8217;ve had to don my somewhat dusty Web Practice Lead hat at Critical Mass to once again defend the faith from tyranny and the inequities of evil men. (Sorry, sudden <em>Pulp Fiction</em> flashback.) That should read to defend against ignorance. But I digress&#8230;<br />
There has been a slight push in the industry over the last few months to return to using tables for web page layouts, rather than the industry standard CSS presentation. Keeping our finger on the pulse of the industry, many of us at Critical Mass have seen the arguments. Some even begin to question our own direction.<br />
This is a good thing, by the way. I want those questions. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> once said, the most dangerous phrase in the language is: &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it this way.&#8221; Bring the arguments. Bring the discussion. Just come armed and educated.<br />
The movement back to tables is an uneducated position. Despite all the arguments for the movement, the one thing it seems to be ignoring is why the W3C standards exist. They&#8217;re not there because a few people thought it was a good idea. They&#8217;re there because a group of people far more educated than I spent the time to figure out what the best method would be.<br />
Yes, CSS is complicated. I will completely agree that in many ways, CSS is far too cumbersome for most developers. I will be among the first to stand up and say that support is not complete and correct. I&#8217;ll gladly point fingers at Microsoft&#8217;s regular aberrant behaviour. CSS is not perfect, and anyone who uses it with any depth will come to realize that there are issues with CSS&#8217;s specification (never mind the often haphazard way the browsers implement the specification).<br />
BUT<br />
Critical Mass does not represent most developers. We have gone beyond what most developers contend with. Our interfaces are richer and more engaging than the majority of designs out there. We deal with clients who expect results better than middle-of-the-road, and that&#8217;s what will drive us to use the right technology for the right reasons.<br />
As strange as it sounds, we work towards segregation: separation of content, presentation, functionality, and structure. This isn&#8217;t just the W3C standard &#8212; this is common sense. Anyone striving to do proper development, in <em>any</em> language, should be doing this. If you tie the structure to presentation, you&#8217;re going to have a fun time making edits when that presentation changes. I&#8217;ve seen this happen hundreds of times before. Veterans in this industry can tell you horror stories of having to change the structure of a website across a thousand files, a tedious task that took weeks. Yes, this can be automated, but the connection is the point &#8212; it should <strong>never</strong> occur.<br />
In this article, they split CSS into CSS and CSS-P. This is an interesting, albeit incorrect direction. Critical Mass (as well as most decent developers) adhere to CSS 2.1, which doesn&#8217;t break down into two parts. It&#8217;s <strong>one</strong> standard that happens to cover the appearance of fonts and colours, and handle the layout of a page. And that&#8217;s what people need to understand.<br />
This requires an understanding of CSS beyond how to use CSS for fonts. From a hiring perspective, we do require that all new hires have an understanding of CSS. While we do not require skills along the lines of Jason Santa Maria, Dave Shea, or Dan Cederholm, although it&#8217;s very cool when someone comes in the door who writes great CSS. We do want to see people laying out pages in CSS, even if it&#8217;s rudimentary and potentially awkward. Only with that understanding can people learn.<br />
When people cry that &#8220;tables are the only way to go&#8221; for websites, they have given up on the standards and all the benefits that come along with them. They have opted to cut themselves short on skills and knowledge and allow the site to suffer long-term. I cannot accept that anyone would willingly throw in the towel to lose out on the flexibility of using CSS over the rigidity of tables.<br />
Arguments such as speed, ROI, tables already being in databases, and standards that are too heavy are grossly uninformed. Speed is pointless because any sufficiently complicated design will necessarily have a sufficiently complicated table &#8212; and that&#8217;s easily larger than using CSS because you have to download the table on every single page. CSS downloads once. ROI is self-defeating because most people only look at the development phase and neglect the far more costly maintenance phase. Well-developed CSS will always allow for faster (hence, cheaper) maintenance. Yes, tables are in a database &#8230; and if that&#8217;s your argument, you&#8217;ve completely misunderstood the need to separate systems. And that&#8217;s not a discussion I&#8217;m getting into now.<br />
It&#8217;s the flexibility that we want. CSS can change quickly (assuming you&#8217;ve architected your CSS appropriately) and the same structure can be reformatted with many CSS files. I challenge anyone to show me how to do CSS Zen Garden in tables. And remember, any sufficiently powerful tool is by its own nature more complicated &#8212; simple isn&#8217;t always better.<br />
All of that said, I do have a concession&#8230;<br />
Despite the need to follow standards (knowing why we use them), there is an overriding condition that we must be aware of at all times: We have to follow budgets. And if something is too difficult to do in CSS, we will build it with tables.<br />
Though I will immediately point out (should this condition arise) that if you are going to tables because it won&#8217;t work with CSS, that I would question the reasons why. If it&#8217;s an infamiliarity with the technology, then more practice might be required. Or that the CSS is already too complex, and there&#8217;s a cascade problem. Specificity is important, and the key is to know when to use global settings and when to use specific references.<br />
And of course, we should ALWAYS use tables for tabular data. But you already know that.<br />
So why is this coming up? Why is there the movement back? In a word: AJAX (oh, how I hate that acronym). The last time we had a major buzzword in the Web Development field, it was DHTML. It&#8217;s equally as annoying as AJAX because it caused everyone to think a new technology existed. (In both cases, it&#8217;s just promoting something that already exists in a novel way.) The buzz has had a positive spin, forcing a lot of previously less-skilled developers to need to learn the standards to implement AJAX correctly. The speed at which people have had to learn is a concern, and those having trouble with CSS are running back to tables.<br />
To those people: slow down. Don&#8217;t panic. The solution is there, you just need to spend some time and play a bit with CSS. Maybe you need to do it at home. If you think CSS isn&#8217;t worth the time and effort, you really need to think about how you&#8217;re approaching your project. I know from my own experience that tables are a dead-end. And if you talk to the best developers in the field, tables are <em>only</em> good for presenting tabular data. Long live CSS.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a tough person. I don&#8217;t settle for mediocrity in my own work, or in the work of those who work with me. There are the minimum height bars, and then there are the ones I set. Knee-capping height, some even high enough to deliver serious abdominal or even cranial damage if you&#8217;re not careful. Normally, I subject only myself to these standards, and beat myself up when I don&#8217;t achieve them. But as I&#8217;m also a manager, they do creep into others&#8217; reviews.<br />
In 2005, I think many people thought I was an outright ass for marking people as hard as I did. I gave &#8220;average&#8221; marks to otherwise outstanding people who made one or two mistakes. I considered them serious mistakes. Not ones that would get people fired, but ones that I really felt needed direct attention. There were repercussions to myself though, and I was brought to task for those marks. Not for the marks themselves, but for the way it was communicated. How are people to know what they&#8217;re being evaluated against?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Chris arrived on Sunday afternoon. The surprise went down on Sunday night. While over dinner, someone wondered if we were going to have a game night.<br />
Dummy me, I&#8217;d never thought of that.<br />
Years ago, when Chris and I used to live downtown, we used to have game nights. We bought a Sega Dreamcast and a Sony Playstation 2. We don&#8217;t have a lot of games, but the ones we do have were good for getting people together and playing against each other. Most of the games we have are Japanese &#8212; ones you can&#8217;t get in North America. (You can&#8217;t get them at all now, but even when they were on the market, they weren&#8217;t sold in North America.) Games such as Rival Schools and Powerstone 2. Then there&#8217;s the heavy duty fighting games like Soul Calibur.<br />
None of these I particularly like. I&#8217;m not a fighting game sort of person. I&#8217;ve generally prefered single-player games. (Yes, you can joke about this all you want.) Gimme the old-school games like Doom and Quake, and more recent ones like Grand Theft Auto. Mano-a-mano scenarios never really appeal to me too much. MMORGs like World of Warcraft are ones I tend to avoid.<br />
The nights were almost legendary. Fifteen, maybe twenty people all crammed into our living room, jostling each other, taking turns in the trash talk and game play. We&#8217;d start after work on Fridays, and the action would go on until early in the morning. We were loud. Very loud. I&#8217;m amazed to this day that we never once got a noise complaint &#8212; or the cops showing up at our door.<br />
Thankfully, a basement in a detached house is a lot more soundproof than even a concrete apartment. Even if the room is a lot smaller.<br />
For a brief moment, it was like old times. Different place, but the old same faces, the old same habits. Most of the skills had gone rusty over the years, and indeed different people won than could have won four and a quarter years ago. It&#8217;s hard to believe it&#8217;s actually been that long, that long since the Asian Brother Crew got together in such merriment. A reminder that things change and time passes. It&#8217;s saddening and happy at the same time.<br />
Pizza. Fresh-baked oatmeal and butterscotch-chip cookies. Potato chip flavours we would never normally think of eating. Round robin matches, with much victory and loss. Some games that would no longer load (ages defeats us all, it seems).<br />
Virgil left shortly after dinner. The others held out for much longer, but it was a school night, and people were due to leave before too long. The gaming slowed, and the waves of departure began. Two people here, three people there. Soon, it was just Chris, Kaz, Alex, and myself.<br />
I slept poorly. It was over. As I had thought would happen &#8212; I blinked, and the time passed.<br />
This morning, I gathered myself to go to work. Chris and Kaz met me at the door as I prepared to leave. I hate saying goodbye. But I had to go to work, I had a scheduled client call at the time I would normally have taken them to the airport. Ironically, the call was cancelled.<br />
Chris is on his way back to Japan. With luck, our paths might cross again next year. But it will be increasingly more difficult for this to happen. Though I really want to go back to Japan, I&#8217;m not sure when that might happen again.<br />
But it will happen. That I am sure of.<br />
