		<p>I found out today that I&#8217;ve become middle management. I&#8217;ve become my own arch-nemesis.<br />
Critical Mass has (almost) finished its massive organizational effort. It&#8217;s not really a reorganization, per se, but it is a process that we&#8217;ve needed to go through for a very long time.<br />
This year, Critical Mass turns eight years old. It&#8217;s been almost six years since the launch of our first website. I&#8217;m employee #175, and new people are in the #400 range. We&#8217;ve got a lot of people that need organziation to get through their daily lives. So with the introduction of Thelton, our new COO (well, &#8220;new&#8221; as of September), we dove into the melee of putting an actual structure into Critical Mass.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is the first anniversary of my father&#8217;s death.<br />
The last time I saw my father was over a year ago (see [[A Slight Ray of Sunshine on a Very Cloudy Day]]). Since then, all I&#8217;ve had are pictures and the memory of the sound of his voice. I have no home movies, no audio tapes. Just memories that will fade with time, eventually to the point where I can barely remember him.<br />
I no longer speak of Dad in the way I used to. Now it&#8217;s with more reverence, and with more humour. For some reason, I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of using phrases that are prefaced with: &#8220;As my father used to say&#8230;&#8221;, even if I know full well he never said those things. I attribute many of the things I know to him &#8212; most of my home maintenance and renovation skills (most of which, admittedly, is unproven), my (limited) knowledge of automobile mechanics, some of my financial sense (though I have to give most credit to Cathy, also known as my financial advisor), my love of adventure, my desire to travel, and a purpose in life.<br />
Dad didn&#8217;t teach me all these things. I learn a lot through observation. (Hence, my &#8220;Observer&#8221; moniker.) And I certainly cannot mention learning without mentioning Mom. She taught me the rules of life, probably the hardest rules to learn. Mom knew me better as a child than I knew myself.<br />
It&#8217;s been a year without my father. And it&#8217;s been a strange year. A couple of months ago, my family started discussing the possibility of what to do on the anniversary. There had been talk of Las Vegas. Not Dad&#8217;s favourite place, but I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d appreciate the need for celebration rather than mourning. Dad never was a big fan of that.<br />
Hopefully, today will pass without notice. I have no plans to call anyone in my family. Unless I need to. Today, I think all that I may do is find a quiet corner of a bar or pub somewhere, and have a glass of Scotch in my father&#8217;s name.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With Cathy at work, and Craig sleeping for the day (he&#8217;s currently working nights), there was little that would cause me to rise early.<br />
Well, almost nothing. I had a lunch date to keep.<br />
Rising at a reasonable hour, I showered, shaved, dressed, and headed out for the GO Train (thankfully, within walking distance &#8212; though I ended up jogging most of the way there). My ultimate destination that day was the corner of Bloor and Spadina. On the south side, a few blocks west of that corner, I would find New Generation Sushi, where I was planning to meet up with my dear friend Kathryn.<br />
I should emphasize the word &#8220;planning&#8221;. You see, at that point, planning was all Kathryn and I had done. We hadn&#8217;t really *confirmed* anything. I had left a couple of messages with Kathryn, and over the course of the morning, kept calling to see if things were still a &#8220;go&#8221;. But the cell phone wouldn&#8217;t pick up, nor would the land line be answered. Deciding that in the worst-case scenario that I&#8217;d still find something to do, I proceeded with the plan as I knew it.<br />
I hopped the University line upon arriving in Toronto and headed to the Spadina station, mistakenly believing that it was part of the Bloor line station as well (meaning it was near Bloor St.). Of course, it wasn&#8217;t, and was several blocks to the north. No big deal &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t that cold, and was worth the wander. Besides, I was almost an hour ahead of schedule, and had a little time to kill.<br />
I&#8217;ve gotten really good at killing time. I really need to get &#8220;Professional Time Assassin&#8221; business cards printed up.<br />
I found the restaurant, but passed it by in favour of seeing what else I could find in my spare time. Almost reaching Bathurst, I spotted a Starbucks on the north side of the road, and suddenly felt the need for a hot chocolate.<br />
I soon found myself sitting in a Starbucks on the corner of Bloor and Albany, the radiant sun pouring into through the south-facing window, warming my back, the hot chocolate heating my soul. Sitting by the window, listening to Jazz playing in the store, watching Toronto pass by in their daily lives, I felt purely decadent. For a powerfully brief moment, I remembered what I liked about being in Toronto.<br />
Kathryn and I finally connected, and confirmed plans to meet up at the restaurant at 13:30. This meant I still had a little time to kill. So I wandered down Bloor St. back to Spadina, crossing over and coming over to the restaurant. I got a seat for two and started to wait. Thankfully, Kathryn is punctual.<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering how it is that I can meet up with Kathryn at 13:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. Doesn&#8217;t she have to work? In fact, Kathryn is one of Toronto&#8217;s shining stars, and a very busy stage manager. Since leaving school, she&#8217;s done 35 shows of one kind or another. Thirty-five. (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done that many websites.) Her line of work keeps her busy, but usually at night (during production, that is), meaning her days are somewhat free.<br />
Currently, Kathryn is engaged in a play called &#8220;China Doll&#8221;, which is about the Chinese tradition of foot-binding, which ended around 1911. The play starts in the early 1900s and goes until 1917. Had I more time, I think I would have very much enjoyed seeing the play.<br />
We talked for about 45 minutes before finally ordering food. Then we walked for another half hour before the food arrived. We ate, chatted a bit, then talked more. Finally paying the bill, we headed out down Bloor St., still talking. We babbled the whole way into Yorkville, and into cups of coffee and hot chocolate. We chatted until we could chat no more &#8212; and that was only because Kathryn had to go to work, and I had to go meet up with my friend Ed down at Union Station. So we talked all the way to the Museum subway station.<br />
It had been almost exactly three years (give or take a couple of days) since Kathryn and I had spent a significant amount of time together. There had been a bit of time when Kathryn had attended my sister&#8217;s wedding (see [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]]), but because of things that had to happen, we had talked only briefly before she&#8217;d had to leave for a performance that night. Three years. So needless to say, when Kathryn&#8217;s train disappeared into the tunnel as I waited for mine, there was a distinctly hollow feeling &#8212; I don&#8217;t get to see my close friends often enough.<br />
It had been nearly a year and half since the last time I saw Ed (see [[Star Wars and the Last Episode of The X-Files]]), but he hadn&#8217;t changed much. The hair was a bit longer, a little lighter (due to some streaking, so I understand), though he looked a lot more tired than I had remembered. (Given how hard he was working, that wasn&#8217;t too surprising.) We met up and headed off for the 17:34 train to Oakville.<br />
Brian was waiting for us when we arrived. I don&#8217;t really know for sure, but I think the last time I saw Brian was New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1998. Aside from the hairdo, he hadn&#8217;t changed, either. The three of us piled into Brian&#8217;s sports car, and went off in search of a place to hang out for the evening. We ended up at Sharkey&#8217;s.<br />
Sharkey&#8217;s has been a mainstay in Oakville for ages. Apparently, it won&#8217;t be for much longer, as it is slated for demolition. Oakville needs another block of condominiums. But for now, it still reigns supreme on the shores of the 16 Mile Creek, and in the bar, we set up shop to catch up on old times.<br />
Brian and Ed were roommates of mine at the University of Waterloo, living in the Columbia Lake Townhouses. We shared the four-room unit with my roommate from first year, Roger. (Roger is currently living in Prague, so unfortunately was unable to attend the reunion.) The four of us had spent an almost bizarre eight months living under the same roof. It had been together that we&#8217;d witnessed the Blue Jays winning their first World Series, and the Montreal Canadiens winning their last Stanley Cup. And numerous other events, including the Penny Fight, broken shower floors and back doors, watching the &#8220;ducks&#8221;, scaring the hell out of each other, The Neutral Zone, and chemical warfare.<br />
Brian and Ed have had the luxury of seeing each other quite a lot over the last few years. So needless to say, I felt like a bit of an outsider. But it&#8217;s not too bad &#8230; they made sure I felt completely included in the massive string of insults and personal attacks, all good-natured, of course. This was how we&#8217;d conducted ourselves in university, which more and more felt like it was only months ago, not years.<br />
Things have changed over the years, though. We all got engaged, though only Brian, Ed, and Roger got married. I supposedly had enough sense to back out of my engagement before it was too late. Brian is now separated, as is Roger. We joked quite a lot about the &#8220;Columbia Lake Curse&#8221;, and kept looking at Ed to see if he was next in line (for the record, he gave no indication that he was).<br />
Although it was a time I would have gladly continued until the bar closed, both Brian and Ed have to work tomorrow. Such is the sadness of being on vacation &#8212; you can&#8217;t always do what you want to do. But plans are sort of in the works for later this year, as I might be coming out for a camping trip with the guys. It&#8217;s been far too long since the last time I camped.<br />
They dropped me off at Cathy&#8217;s, and I bid them both a good night. I was brought forward into the present, leaving the past of university behind. But it won&#8217;t be the only time on this vacation&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is about this time of year, but I seem to have a penchant for buying expensive things. Last year, I bought a house. This year, I bought my first new car.<br />
For those of you now saying: &#8220;He bought a Mini&#8221;, you would be correct. There are a few of you out there who said I should have bought the Cooper S (the sport version). A little too expensive for me right now &#8212; maybe in a couple of years, I&#8217;ll trade in the one I have. A few of you might frown on my little green bag. Of my favourite deterrents, one even called it a &#8220;girl car&#8221;. Personally, I always thought that was a VW Cabriolet. Call it what you will, this is the only street legal go-kart I know of.<br />
Not even a week ago, I was in the general vicinity of the Mini dealership, and thought I&#8217;d drop in to have a chat with Michael, the Mini salesperson who had been fielding my seemingly endless questions. Unfortunately, he wasn&#8217;t in that night. Another salesperson, also named Michael, chatted me up. We talked about the Mini, and a little about the one I wanted. Michael &#8212; the one I had been talking with before &#8212; had indicated there were a few on-site that might match my needs. Michael &#8212; the one I was talking to at the time &#8212; had some additional ideals.<br />
My criteria were pretty simple: I wanted a cool, distinctive car that had no practical purpose. Yeah, I know, &#8220;mid-life crisis&#8221;. Frankly, if I&#8217;m having a mid-life crisis now, I need help. A lot of it. I think the reality is that I&#8217;m, well, boring. Yes, I&#8217;ll admit it. Dull. Blah. Without any sense of edge. Predictable, even. (Don&#8217;t believe me, check out the comments a few people wrote about me in a survey I sent out a couple years back. See [[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Geoff Sowrey]] for details.)<br />
When Stuart had first shown me a picture of the new Mini a couple years ago, I about freaked. It was perhaps the coolest thing on four wheels I had ever seen. For the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been following the launch of the Mini worldwide, and especially in Canada. For a while, I&#8217;ve lamented living in Calgary &#8212; we were one of the last major cities in Canada to get a Mini dealership. (Saskatoon got one before us. Yes, Saskatoon.) Anyway, about as soon as one opened here, I started looking.<br />
At Christmas, Critical Mass gave me a bonus (why, I&#8217;m not really sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure if I really earned it). While I&#8217;m not at liberty to say how much, it was enough to make me seriously give thought to buying a new car. I guess I need not elaborate on what direction this took me.<br />
Anyway, back to the second Michael. He showed me a model he had sitting in the showroom. It was a demo unit purchased by Mini Canada (Corporate Office) for one of their executives. When they were done with it, the Calgary office purchased it for resale. At a discount. And so began what ended up being a three-day bargaining session. Mini would come to me with a price, and I would turn it around, looking for incentive. It wasn&#8217;t easy &#8212; unlike other dealerships, Mini has the luxury of waiting for the next person to snap up a waiting vehicle. As it stands, I was the first of about five people interesting in purchasing that car.<br />
It&#8217;s British Racing green. (Dark green, for those of you unfamiliar with the colour.) White roof and mirrors. White alloy wheels. Beige leather interior. And really, really, really comfy. So what was the catch?<br />
Manual transmission.<br />
The interesting part is that I actually went out looking for manual. Why? Two reasons. One, it&#8217;s more fuel-efficient than the automatic (a general rule). In fact, the manual transmission Mini Cooper is one of the EPA&#8217;s Top 10 most fuel efficient cars. Secondly, it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t really want to get the automatic. It&#8217;s a CVT &#8211; Continuously Variable Transmission. Basically, no gears. While an uber-cool idea, I was a little paranoid of what would happen if it broke &#8212; how much would it cost to fix? Manuals are less expensive.<br />
Problem: I&#8217;d only ever driven manual once before (see [[Long Weekend in Kelowna, Penticton]]). I know the principle. It&#8217;s just the practice. Which I need.<br />
Now I have one other problem: Where to park it. I can&#8217;t leave the car parked on the road (the city doesn&#8217;t really like that). Naturally, I should park it in my garage. That&#8217;s what I tried to figure out on Saturday &#8212; clean it out, and prepare it for a car. But very early on, I realized I was going to have a major problem: The garage door.<br />
One of the previous owners (I&#8217;m not sure which) decided to sabotage the garage door and remove all the gizmos that let you open and close the door. The door itself is nailed in place. Opening and closing it at present requires two people and a hammer. Not exactly convenient. Closer inspection made me believe that I wasn&#8217;t going to solve my problem with a screwdriver and a mallet. No, I needed a new door.<br />
Off to Revy, where after a few minutes, I happened upon a gentleman by the name of Gerald, who got me the details. Luckily, I have a standard-sized door for my somewhat unstandard garage. It wasn&#8217;t exactly cheap to purchase the door, but I opted also for installation and removal of the old door. I&#8217;ve learned from many people that you simple do not try to install a garage door unless you know what you&#8217;re doing. And aside from the fact that it would take two cars to carry something as large as a garage door, I have no idea what to do with it anyway.<br />
Returning door-less (it comes some time this week), I proceeded to clean out the garage. I succeeded only with the returnable recyclables (we get money back for the containers for which we pay deposits). That pretty much left me incapable of walking, mostly as a result of my first week at the gym. I finished the following day, though not without injury &#8212; I now have a terribly sore throat.<br />
I hate being sick.<br />
Tonight, I signed away what little life I have left after the house, and picked up my new car. This was a good thing, since I was barely able to concentrate on sqwat all day. It took about an hour and a half, including all the financial work, and the walkaround. Yes, a walkaround. You don&#8217;t just drive away from a BMW dealership &#8212; you get the full meal deal. Which is good, because there were a few little things that I wouldn&#8217;t have known otherwise.<br />
I picked up Tamara from home, and we went for a drive. First, to the office to pick up proof of earnings, which I had mistakenly forgot at the office. After faxing that in, we went in search of a Shopper&#8217;s Drug Mart. I needed throat lozenges, very badly. Then it was to Dairy Queen for a quick celebration, and back to the house. As I sit here typing, I can hear the car calling to me.<br />
&#8220;Drive me!&#8221; it coos.<br />
But I need to go to bed &#8212; I have to be up early to go to the gym. I must resist its lures. All I can do it wait with baited breath for the weekend, when I can drive free of the city &#8230; and practice my hill starts without backing into anyone. Maybe I&#8217;ll get Therese and Stuart to teach me.<br />
This time next year, I&#8217;ll have to refrain from anything too expensive. Right now, I&#8217;m thinking of a Snickers bar.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A little exercise never killed anyone &#8230; but there&#8217;s always a first time.<br />
This morning, I made my first visit to a gym in about seven years. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, and no, it&#8217;s not some lame New Year&#8217;s resolution that I&#8217;ve finally got around to. I&#8217;ve actually been wanting to do this for over a year and a half, but found every excuse I could to avoid it. Now I have a vested interest in fitness, and made an effort to give myself no option.<br />
On Saturday, I dropped by the YMCA in Eau Claire, forked over the fee, and got myself a membership. I then went out for a new pair of shoes that I knew I was going to need. This morning, I woke at 5:30, grabbed my bag, and headed out to see what new definitions of pain I could discover.<br />
Actually, I wasn&#8217;t quite that negative. I had a fairly ambitious goal: An hour workout without passing out, heaving up, or needing the assistance of emergency medical sevices.<br />
Laugh if you will, but to say my mind and body are at odds when it comes to exercise is like saying Israel and Palestine are bosom buddies.<br />
Body: I need exercise! Get me in shape, Mind!<br />
Mind: I hate exercise. It&#8217;s so monotonous.<br />
Body: Either you get me exercise, or I&#8217;ll start craving things you won&#8217;t like.<br />
Mind: Ha! Go on. I&#8217;m not scared of you. You have no power over me.<br />
Body: One word: Tequila.<br />
Mind: Is 6:00 okay for you?<br />
Of course, once things get underway, there&#8217;s a sight reversal&#8230;<br />
Body: SWEET JESUS! What were you thinking?!<br />
Mind: Hey, don&#8217;t blame this one me! You&#8217;re the one who wanted this, pal!<br />
Body: Yeah, okay, but 10 kilometres of rowing, 20 kilometres of biking *uphill*, and then a 15-minute endurance swim? That&#8217;s just mean!<br />
Mind: Stop being such a baby, it&#8217;s not that bad. It&#8217;s just mind over matter.<br />
Body: But I don&#8217;t have a mind &#8212; that&#8217;s you!<br />
Mind: Not my problem&#8230;<br />
One of them is gonna kill me. It&#8217;s just a matter of time&#8230;<br />
The Eau Claire YMCA is about 15 years old. The shape that it&#8217;s kept in, you&#8217;d swear no more than a third of that. The facilities are huge &#8212; they have to be for the number of people who come through there &#8212; and immaculately kept. The equipment is in great shape (although the footstraps on the rowing machine kept coming loose), the place is spotless, the air temperature about perfect, and the water in the pool is devine (except the near-lethal levels of chlorine).<br />
So yes, I hurt. Not a lot, mind you &#8212; I didn&#8217;t do weights. That&#8217;s tomorrow morning. Mostly, it&#8217;s my head. Muscles are beginning to remember that they hold this 20-odd pound of meat in place, and they&#8217;re not really enjoying the extra workout. My inner thighs hurt, but it&#8217;s not from muscles &#8212; my skin has the approximate texture of a cheese grater thanks to the near-desert climbe, and the aforementioned chlorine.<br />
And then there&#8217;s my hands, or more specifically, the skin just under where the finger attaches to the palm. All the callouses I&#8217;d built up when I was with the CBC have apparently worn off. I noticed this when I was showering afterwards &#8212; that burning sensation on my skin couldn&#8217;t be due to anything but inflammed skin. Sure enough &#8212; blisters. Big ones. I guess you got to start somewhere.<br />
My morning went from one workout at the gym, to another workout at the dentist. This was my regular six-month checkup. I hoped it would go much better than my visit this time last year (see [[Going to the Dentist, Getting my first Cavity]]). For the most part, I was right. First exercise in futility: x-rays. Captain Choke struck again, and x-rays were delayed for another visit. Onto scaling and polishing. Snooze. Then it was inspection.<br />
This is the part I&#8217;m beginning to hate. Everytime I get an inspection, the dentist finds something wrong. I&#8217;m not sure if my mouth is just falling apart, or if previous dentists were morons. Either way, as he was probing my teeth, he muttered something about &#8220;D5, inclusion&#8221;, which in dentese apparently means my tooth has gone &#8220;soft&#8221;. In other words: return visit on Thursday for correction.<br />
I just hope it doesn&#8217;t mean drilling.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/2003/02/chinese-new-year-4700-space-shuttle-columbia/" rel="bookmark">Chinese New Year 4700, Space Shuttle Columbia Explosion</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The year 4700 on the Chinese calendar got off to a very sombre start.<br />
Today is Chinese New Year&#8217;s day. Today, I had many things I wanted to do. Most of them were summarily forgotten when, barely a few minutes out of bed, Tamara announced: &#8220;The space shuttle blew up.&#8221; I took pause. I was barely awake enough to know that this was bad, but not awake enough for it to truly have effect.<br />
I marched downstairs and turned on CNN. The coverage wasn&#8217;t as intense as September 11th (see [[Reaction to September 11, 2001 (9/11)]]). CNN was skipping commercials, in favour of coverage. They flipped around constantly, talking with reporters from all over America, periodically talking with an official or former engineer. CBC had entirely different coverage, actually bringing in Roberta Bondar to talk with their anchor. A press conference with the Canadian Space Agency featured Marc Garneau.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t the oppressive feeling of loss or shock. Perhaps we&#8217;ve just become too immune. Then an interesting fact came to light &#8212; it was 17 years and four days since the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded over the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds into the 25th shuttle mission.<br />
Just after noon, I was doing my duty as a student crossing guard, curbing the flow of traffic so students could return to school after lunch. As usual, one girl &#8212; a few grades behind me &#8212; came up to deliver her daily torture. For some reason, we didn&#8217;t much like each other. She was a little caustic, and I had a superiority complex. Yet we each recognized this, and turned it into a game. On that day, however, she instead told me the truth: The shuttle had exploded.<br />
At first, I hadn&#8217;t believed her. The shuttle couldn&#8217;t explode. It was the space shuttle! It was NASA! That sort of thing just doesn&#8217;t happen. (This was long before I&#8217;d learned of the Apollo 1 fire, or saw video of NASA&#8217;s early rocket failures.) My faith in the American space programme was unfaltering. I expected there to be regular flights into space by the time I was 20. For the shuttle to explode just seemed too fantastic.<br />
The truth sank in before I returned to school after lunch. Most of my friends didn&#8217;t go home for lunch, and didn&#8217;t know. They seemed as doubtful as I had been. Barely a few minutes into class, the principal called an assembly in the gym. It was true. The shuttle had exploded barely a minute off the launchpad. I don&#8217;t remember the rest of the afternoon. But I watched the entire 6:00pm CityTV news broadcast, which had been almost entirely devoted to the shuttle disaster (only five minutes were granted to other news).<br />
Seventeen years later, the reaction was different. People seemed shocked, yes, but more were accepting of the dangers of spaceflight. It seems that while people do become complacent about regular shuttle launches, they seem to all know that eventually, something will go wrong. When Tamara had told me the shuttle exploded, I assumed it was a launch. Breaking up on reentry was something I had not considered.<br />
I eventually did run a few errands. But in the back of my mind the entire time was what sort of things could I expect to see. Thoughts of what I&#8217;d seen on September 11th still haunt me. I saw and heard nothing. It was almost like it hadn&#8217;t happened. In fact, if Calgary had been upset by the disaster, it was already well on the way to recovery. Chinese New Year went ahead without pause. It was business as usual.<br />
Still, everyone seemed to talk about the loss of Columbia, even if it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on their minds. We still went to Chinese New Year dinner. We still went about our lives. But the thought is still there. I don&#8217;t know if in 17 years, I&#8217;ll remember where I was today.<br />
But I will remember what happened.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like most people who work the ol&#8217; 9-5 grind, my weekend started just as the whistle blew Friday afternoon. It was time to get my nose off the grindstone and into something far more pleasant. A beer.<br />
Not that I want to sound alcoholic (as if I don&#8217;t already sound like that from previous entries &#8212; see most of the entries from the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC train</a>, [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]], [[My Housewarming Party]], [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]], [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]], [[The Critical Mass Summer Social 2001]], [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]], etc.), but this time I actually had a pretty good excuse. There were a fairly large number of birthdays on my floor of the office (referred to as &#8220;Technology&#8221;, &#8220;The Technical Floor&#8221;, &#8220;Domain of the Extremely Geeky&#8221;, &#8220;Realm of the Magicians&#8221;, and the &#8220;Second Floor&#8221;, depending on who you ask), and a few of us went to celebrate Carl, Nathan (recently returned from Europe), and Jude (who could not join us until later).<br />
It&#8217;s good to get out with other members of the Technology department &#8212; I&#8217;m so isolated working on my account that I rarely ever see them again, except in the two neutral zones on my floor: the washroom and the kitchen. This is our chance to sit around, chat about pretty much anything but work (although it&#8217;s inevitable that we do), and act like idiots &#8230; okay, so it&#8217;s not much different that at the office. But at least we can drink.<br />
Following our beverages, we plummeted ourselves back into the -25 degree evening for the second part of the show. The festivities of the evening were divided into three parts: Vicious Circle (the bar/club where we like to hang out), Sakana Grill (about the only place in town for large groups to go for sushi), and roller skating. I avoided the third part mostly due to a total lack of coordination. That, and I really didn&#8217;t feel like adding that kind of fodder to my journal entries.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t been to Sakana Grill for months with a group (I&#8217;ve been there with Therese and Stuart a couple of times). The last time any large number of us were there was when we said farewell to Chris, Nathan, and Jen as they prepared to leave the company (see [[Preparing to Move to Japan]]). Nathan, Carl, and I were extremely happy to arrive. The temperature outside was bitingly cold, even by my standards. Carl and I opted to warm up with sake. We mistakenly ordered a 1/2 litre of it. Not that I was about to complain&#8230;<br />
We had at least 25 people crammed around two tables. We were loud. Loud enough to attract the new head chef. The last time we&#8217;d been there, Peter had not appeared. Peter was the guy Carl always managed to goad into giving us free rounds of sake. But Peter seems to be gone. Instead, we got Tony. Tony seems a pretty good replacement. He&#8217;s not as quick on the insults (which were one of Peter&#8217;s trademarks), but he&#8217;s a lot more generous with the sake. No-one seemed to mind.<br />
As I previously mentioned, I bailed on the roller-skating. I wanted to be relatively alive the following day. I had plans. Big ones.<br />
I even woke up early. Well, sort of. Earlier than I normally do on a Saturday, but early enough. I was going to make a trip up to the northwest quadrant to visit a car dealership. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that I need a new car. My current one is fine, but I want something newer. Something funkier. Sure, I could very easily keep the car I&#8217;ve got, but let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; I&#8217;m young, I&#8217;m (fairly) well off, and I think I can afford something far more fun than my &#8217;91 Plymouth Acclaim. Could I buy a new Chrysler? Sure. A new GM? I suppose so. How &#8217;bout a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan? Definitely. Do I want to? Not really. At the moment, there&#8217;s only one car I actually want.<br />
A Mini.<br />
Possibly the single most impractical car I could imagine, save for a two-seater coupe. The question is, of course, do I need a practical car? The answer is &#8220;heck no&#8221;! I&#8217;ve got a house with no plans to move any time soon. I&#8217;m not married, and the only dependants I have right now are two cats and an inanimate house.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Geoff&#8217;s hit his mid-life crisis&#8221;. Maybe I have, but I have to say that my father went through more exotic cars by my age than I&#8217;ve had cars, period! I figure, I&#8217;ve earned it. (Okay, maybe I haven&#8217;t &#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t want to have fun!)<br />
At any rate, I went up to the sole Mini dealership in town, and flagged me down a car salesman. Doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; just look like you want to buy. We walked, we talked, we inspected, and we rejected. Finally, he hauled me downstairs to their protected underground garage, and we hopped into one of the cars for a little zip around the area.<br />
The salesman, Michael, drove first. Along the way, he told me a little about himself and a lot about the car. It&#8217;s a fairly impressive bit of engineering. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t Minis little more than a patch of tinfoil wrapped around an engine?&#8221; The original Austin Minis were known for their &#8230; well &#8230; mini-ness. They were small, light, and little more than go-karts with substantial chassis. The new ones were redesigned from the group up by BMW, and contain mostly BMW parts. Think of a 325i crammed into half the size.<br />
I guess I need not mention that it&#8217;s a great drive? It&#8217;s also a bit of a weird drive. While I wanted to give the manual a spin, my experience with a stick shift is a little weak. I opted instead for the automatic. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, does it? This ain&#8217;t no ordinary automatic. It&#8217;s a continuous shifting transmission. In short: No gears. It&#8217;s a large steel belt that slides up and down cone-shaped driveshaft. It&#8217;s pretty ingenious. And you don&#8217;t ever feel a gear shift. It&#8217;s a little unnerving at first.<br />
The question, naturally, is: Can I afford it? I&#8217;ve got my financial advisor working on it. I expect a negative result. I might be well off, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m *that* well off. Hey, I gotta try!<br />
I left the dealership carless &#8230; well, Mini-less. (I still have my Acclaim.) There were other events of the day to tackle, and I needed to get home fairly fast. I still had to tidy up the main floor a little (it&#8217;s looking more like a U-Store than a dining room), sweep the floors, shower, change into something a little more appropriate, and head out to the Zoo.<br />
Why the Zoo? Critical Mass did not have a Christmas Party in December, like we had in the past. This year, for what reasons I&#8217;m not entirely sure, we delayed the party until the latter part of January. Unlike the visit to the Scandinavian Centre (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]), this was at the brand-new Destination Africa exhibit at the Calgary Zoo.<br />
It&#8217;s impressive. According to our tour guide, the Zoo spent over $31 million overhauling the exhibits, giving the animals more room (and more comfort), and increasing the educational value of the Zoo itself. In fact, the entire Zoo is undergoing a series of radical changes. In the coming years, other parts will be upgraded to increase available space, and improve animal&#8217;s living conditions.<br />
Which is important when you have -25 degree weather and animals that live in climates that are usually 50 degrees warmer.<br />
Our party didn&#8217;t start until 4:00. I met up with Shantie at the Zoo C-Train station and proceeded to start on a tour of the Zoo. I&#8217;d never been there before. Shantie&#8217;s been an annual visitor, usually because of nieces and nephews. But the Zoo had changed quite a lot since she&#8217;d last been there. And with the wind whipping around, we made a point to enter the nearest warm building we could find.<br />
We went to the Transalta Rainforest first. But more on that place later. Next, we braved the brisk outside and raced over to the greenhouses, where the Zoo has recreated a rainforest and a desert environment. It&#8217;s almost all plants, except for songbirds in the rainforest, and a couple of meerkats in the desert.<br />
Plunging back outside, we hopped over to the Large Mammals building, which save for a pair of ostriches (which Shantie knows a lot about &#8212; her father used to raise them), a couple of elephants, a warthog, a flock of peahens, and a tapir, was mostly empty. Most of the animals are being moved to the Savannah building &#8212; I figure the Large Mammals building is on the list for overhaul.<br />
We circled the rest of the Zoo, our pace quickening with each second we were outside. The trip back was torture, as we now headed into the wind. I lost feeling in my ears. My thighs were going numb. By the time we reached the African Lodge, we were probably running risk of frostbite. The warm air of the Lodge was very welcome.<br />
The tour began about 20 minutes after we arrived. Our guide, Stuart, took a group of us from the Lodge and into the Rainforest. Now we get back to what I skipped before. The Rainforest building is new &#8212; only opened about two weeks ago. It&#8217;s very impressive &#8212; all the trees are real (except the baobab &#8212; it&#8217;s a cold air return duct), and there are animals everywhere. Two of the most impressive parts are the gorilla enclosure, and the aviary.<br />
The gorilla enclosure is massive. It&#8217;s got a huge indoor area that you can view from several angles, a small outdoor &#8220;winter&#8221; enclosure, and a rather large outdoor summer enclosure. The family of nine apes gets along quite well, save for the newbie. (She was raised by humans and hasn&#8217;t quite figured out that she&#8217;s actually a gorilla.)<br />
The enclosure was also supposed to have a set of Colobus monkeys. However, it seemed that the keepers and the architects couldn&#8217;t really overcome one minor problem: Colobus monkeys are really devious. The enclosure is hot-wired &#8212; there are electrical lines that run the perimeter of the main area, and even up the trunks of three trees. Fences prevent escape, and the surfaces are non-graspable. Didn&#8217;t stop the monkeys. The just upped and ran. Luckily, the building goes into lockdown in cases like that, so the monkeys couldn&#8217;t get away.<br />
The aviary is completely netted off, for a similar reason. So far, nothing&#8217;s escaped. Impressive when the birds could probably fly between the mesh if they tried (or rip it open), and there are three ring-tailed lemurs inside. The lemurs are a hoot to watch. When we&#8217;d come through the first time, you could barely see them amongst the massive support poles. But this time, the lemurs were in plain sight &#8212; 70 feet up in the rafters of the roof. The must love the heights.<br />
From the Rainforest we moved to the Savannah &#8212; a huge building that houses warthogs, porcupines, a nasty-lookin&#8217; vulture, two giraffes, and two hippos. Unlike the Rainforest, you can see pretty much everything in the building from anywhere. The central point, of course, is the 80,000 litre hippo tank. Ungainly on land, these creatures swim like ballerinas when submerged.<br />
Returning to the Lodge, most of Critical Mass&#8217; employees had arrived with their guests. The lobby was full of chatting people, with others having moved into the hall. The entire building has an African motif (for obvious reasons), which include the paint on the walls, the tablecloths, and the main chandelier &#8212; a dugout outrigger, fitted with lights in the hull.<br />
Dinner was buffet-style, nothing overly fancy. But all very tasty. The difficult part was seating &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of tables. The centre of the room had a wood floor, which was surrounded by chairs, and filled with various instruments. This was part of our entertainment for the night.<br />
Not long after dinner, the music started. People took seats around a small group of people in the middle. Instructions were given, and the people in the middle (not C-Massers, but musicians hired for the job) started to play. All the instruments, save for a single keyboard and one guitar, were all percussion.<br />
It was a drumming circle, for lack of any better term to use. The musicians in the centre started the rhythm, which everyone else picked up on. The leader slowly brought everyone in until there was a single pulsating chorus of drums, cowbells, and shakers. The leader rose the sound up, and took it down as a conductor would lead an orchestra. The energy was amazing.<br />
An hour later, most people were drummed out. It takes a lot of energy, and a few people had a headache from it. (The room&#8217;s acoustics are quite good, so you could hear very well.) Following the drumming was, of course, dancing. Few people danced at first, partly because everyone was a little tired from drumming, and also because Critical Mass is like a high school at times, and no-one wants to be the first out.<br />
The DJ compensated by starting a conga line. It weaved all around, trying to suck up people. It was quite successful, but the line broke so often that we ended up with about a half-dozen lines running through the building.<br />
The show closed down at midnight, sharp. That was the rule from the start. We picked ourselves up, aimed for the door, and waited for the shuttle bus. Although the wind had died for the night, it had to be nearly -30 outside. This is the second time Critical Mass has had these temperatures for their holiday season festivities. (The last time, I walked &#8212; or rather, stumbled &#8212; about 15 blocks back to my apartment. Luckily, I was insulated by a protective shield of booze at the time.) Shantie gave me a lift home, rather than freeze on the C-Train.<br />
The only thing that was really missing from our soiree? No drunken stupidity. In what is probably a first for a Critical Mass function, everyone left relatively sober.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m as puzzled as you are.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s the beginning of the year. It&#8217;s quiet. I&#8217;m (somewhat) relaxed. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve got a cold.  At least, I think it&#8217;s a cold. It doesn&#8217;t behave like most rhinovirii I&#8217;ve had in the past &#8212; no fever, no stuffy feeling, no constantly-dripping nose. In fact, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s actually given me anything. Although it has taken something away&#8230;<br />
My voice. I can barely whisper, let alone say something.<br />
[Insert thunderous cheers from everyone sitting around me here.]<br />
Yes, many people around here have been enjoying the drop in noise level. I&#8217;ve even had a few people mention that things seem different, only to find that I can&#8217;t say anything. And, of course, I&#8217;ve had those jokers who seem to think that it&#8217;s their responsibility to make comments about my vocal disability, even to the point of deliberately asking me questions that I need to answer.<br />
I have to remember to cough on their keyboards.<br />
It&#8217;s a weird feeling. My larynx has an an extremely faint soreness to it, but that might just be from me clearing my throat when trying to say something. Otherwise, I feel fine. In fact, I&#8217;ve forgotten more than once that I can&#8217;t say anything today, until I hear that airy chirp that emits from my mouth. I don&#8217;t have a frog in my throat, I&#8217;ve got a mouse.<br />
This all started yesterday morning. I came to work with a sore throat. I thought it was due to dryness in the house. Barely halfway into the morning, I could hear my voice cracking. It was puberty all over again. By the end of the day, talking was forced. (I had to take Spaz to the vet again last night. More pills to ease her breathing. Now if the little furball would just take them&#8230;)<br />
When I woke up this morning, I thought I was fine again. Then I tried to talk to the cat. (Yes, I talk to the cat.) Squeak. Spaz snapped her head up, thinking she heard a mouse. I tried to say something again. Squeak. Spaz stared at me hungrily. Nothing like a just-shy-of-six-foot tall mouse! I opted to shower before she got any ideas.<br />
So today, I have relied tremendously on the modern technology of text. Email and ICQ have been my best friends today, allowing me to continue with my job without saying a word. Of course, Allard still likes to ask a question or two, making me cringe at what I&#8217;m going to sound like next.<br />
I just hope this starts going away soon. The pack of cats following me around is getting a little worrisome.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Another year, come and gone&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t. This has perhaps been the single most turbulent year of my life. I had the deep low of my father&#8217;s death, coupled with the meteoric high of participating with the CBC 50th Anniversary train. Many times I thought I was going to lose my sanity or even my job. Perseverence, not to mention blind faith, helps moves things forward. But I did live up to a few things last year (see [[2001, A Year in Review]]): I spent more time out of the office. Not really getting a life, but it&#8217;s a start.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This has simultaneously been the quietest and the busiest Christmas season I think I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I had been looking forward to two weeks of quiet rest, working on personal projects, sleeping, watching movies, and trying my darnedest to relax before the beginning of the new year.<br />
Life loves to mess around with my plans.<br />
Officially off on 20 December, I resolved to sleep &#8230; well, once I had my shopping done. So on the 21st, I wandered down to Chinook (via the C-Train, mostly because I knew parking would be a disaster) and see what I could see. I saw little, except hoardes of people all trying to find the perfect gift. I decided to try my little trick of last year &#8212; find what I want, see a matinee, and shop when everyone else had gone home for dinner. Only problem: No movie I hadn&#8217;t already seen was available at the right time. I had to return to shopping &#8230; but only at two stores. I retreated to downtown where things tend to make more sense.<br />
My mother arrived in town on the 23rd. The plan, originally, was to have the entire family out in this neck of the woods. But Cathy and Craig ended up stranded in Southern Ontario. Airfare, especially during the Christmas season, is far too pricey for people in the midst of a kitchen renovation. We would miss most of their precence this year &#8212; the second Christmas that Cathy and I would spend apart.<br />
The first Saturday and Sunday were occupied with me running errands and cleaning. I didn&#8217;t know when family was going to start dropping by. I had also hoped to finish my Christmas shopping before then. Ya, right. I didn&#8217;t finish shopping right up until the 24th &#8212; my usual timeframe.<br />
One of these days, I&#8217;ll have enough smarts to start earlier. Probably when I can get someone else to do it for me&#8230;<br />
I spent Christmas Eve with two of my closest friends, Tara and Scott, and our friend Geoff. (Yes, having two Geoffs in the same room makes conversation challenging. Getting the both of them drunk makes it funny.) It was a seafood smorgasbord: shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster. We ate, laughed, and carried on until into the wee hours. Mostly because we had to make sure Geoff (the other one) was &#8220;safe&#8221; to go home. Geoff, it seems, has an allergy to shellfish.<br />
The one day I had been really looking forward to was Christmas morning. I was looking forward to sleeping in. Tamara was with her family out past Tisdale, Saskatchewan. It was just me and the cats. And a 7:30 wake-up call. I had to pick up my mom from her hotel. The story had unfolded the day before:<br />
Me (picking up the phone): Hello?<br />
Mom: Hi, it&#8217;s me! Here&#8217;s the plan for tomorrow. We&#8217;re going over to Brenda&#8217;s [my aunt]. Pick me up at 8:30.<br />
Me: 8:30 at night? That&#8217;s a little late for dinner, don&#8217;t you think?<br />
Yes, I actually said that. It took me a moment to realize what was really meant.<br />
I spent Christmas morning with my family. It was nice not to have to open presents &#8212; well, I had to open a few, but they were small. After this year, small is the best I could ever want. Dinner was a turkey tsunami &#8212; all wonderful, but as usually, too much. (I ate way too much this holiday season &#8230; as per usual.)<br />
Boxing Day is North America&#8217;s single largest day of pure capitalism. It&#8217;s a chance for everyone to become completely moronic, act without care of fellow human, and rack up even more debt. So, yeah, I went shopping.<br />
But not until about 11:00am. I wasn&#8217;t willing to get up early. And I wasn&#8217;t willing to visit any of the main malls. I kept it quiet and simple: A&amp;B Sound and HMV, both downtown, and both in walking distance. A&amp;B Sound was a zoo &#8212; people everywhere, and none of them really finding what they seemed to be looking for. Of course, the store had opened at 7:00am, and people had started lining up at midnight. That kind of thing I just do not understand.<br />
On the 28th, we celebrated Nana&#8217;s 90th birthday. Nana is my sole living grandparent. Her actual birthday isn&#8217;t until late January, but this was the most convenient time to have most of her family come and celebrate with her all at once. So for one night, we zipped one month into the future to wish Nana a happy birthday. Even Cathy and Craig made an &#8220;appearance&#8221;, through the magic of pre-recorded messages on video tape.<br />
Like almost every Tisdale clan affair, it was met with far too much good food. I arrived almost four hours ahead of Nana (she was off with my Uncle David, exploring the Kananaskis) to help prepare the meals. We had a wide-ranging theme of dishes, including Vietnamese salad rolls, Asian scallops, mini crab cakes (Jen and I spent the better part of an hour cracking crab on the only available surface &#8212; the floor), and the coupe de grace &#8212; a huge roast beef. I didn&#8217;t eat the next day until almost dinner.<br />
Before I knew it, it was Mom&#8217;s last day in town. We spent it partially at the mall, where we browsed several shops, and also at my home, where she visited with Spaz. There is never enough time for everything, though &#8212; soon, she was back at the airport, and I was watching her through security on her flight back to Toronto.<br />
New Year&#8217;s Eve &#8212; a night when most people (like Tamara) go out and have fun. Me? I watched Minority Report, The Emperor&#8217;s New Groove, and barely half of Lord of the Rings before I called it a night. I wasn&#8217;t interested in going out. It&#8217;s been a hard year. It was a night I wanted to spend alone.<br />
With all the family, activity, and distractions, I didn&#8217;t start feeling really relaxed until this morning. I woke just before 11:00am, and ventured downstairs to watch TV. Exciting, eh? But I had a reason &#8212; today, in theory, would be my moment of national fame. In theory, I&#8217;d be on CBC.<br />
Following the Governor-General&#8217;s and Prime Minister&#8217;s messages to the country, CBC aired the last remaining show of their 50th Anniversary celebrations &#8212; a 50-minute documentary of the CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train. I got to sit and watch friends again, new footage I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and a few surprises I hadn&#8217;t expected. Hopefully now, people can understand what I did, and why I have so much difficulty trying to explain what it was like.<br />
And this is how my year begins &#8212; with a new sense of being, sense of future, and a desire to experience more that this world of ours has to offer. That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t do a lot this year. But that&#8217;s another email&#8230;</p>
