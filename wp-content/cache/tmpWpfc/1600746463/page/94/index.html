	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite the plethora of forest fires plaguing the B.C. interior, my family decided it was a good weekend to dive into the (mostly) green forests of Banff National Park.<br />
Now you&#8217;re probably wondering why on Earth I noted forest fires in B.C. when Banff National Park is clearly in Alberta. Simply put: smoke travels. Calgary has had many hazy days as a result of all the fires, and my eyes have itched a fair amount due to airborne particulates. As we left the city, you couldn&#8217;t see the Rockies in the distance. It will be like this until the forest fires end.<br />
I started off my morning slapping another coat of paint around the windows. I came inside to prepare for the excursion only to find Miao-Yin had decided to lay waste to my couch with the former contents of her stomach. After vigourously repressing the urge to use her as a furry soccer ball (I banned her to the basement for the next 24 hours instead), I cleaned up the mess, then cleaned myself and gathered my photography equipment, finishing just as my family arrived to pick me up.<br />
Uncle Mike drove with Nana riding shotgun. I sat behind Mike; Mom behind Nana. Aunt Brenda, Maggie, and Jen took up the rear of the minivan. With the A/C on full blast (or so it felt), we took off for the trip into the mountains.<br />
Our first stop (not counting the raid of Robin&#8217;s Donuts to get a snack for the ride out) was at the Three Sisters Mountain Village. This is a new development project up the mountain slopes on the south-eastern edge of Canmore. This is a massive project &#8212; the Three Sisters bought up 1,800 acres of land, and portioned them out into lots for fairly expensive homes (condos starting at $250,000 and homes starting at around $400,000) to homes starting at 4,500 square feet (I don&#8217;t want to know the price). Naturally, the area is pockmarked with golf courses.<br />
The development is mostly to cater to those who want to live the Banff lifestyle, but can&#8217;t move into Banff (which has a limitation on development). While Canmore doesn&#8217;t lie within the boundaries of Banff National Park, the city council seems to have kept the general ideas in place. Canmore has yet to acquire a real &#8220;mall&#8221; of any kind.<br />
Sighing off the prices that none of us can (or will ever) afford, we proceeded to Banff. Or more specifically, to the line-up for Banff. Despite the haze brought on by forest fire smoke, a large number of Albertans and tourists alike were gathered at the park entrance to acquire their day passes. So naturally, we ended up in the slowest line.<br />
Mike and Brenda decided to renew their annual pass, and made quick work of the purchase. About a half hour after entering the line, we were pulling off for the Minnewanka Loop. The Minnewanka Loop is a road on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway, across from Banff Townsite. The road is a several-kilometre loop up to Lake Minnewanka, across the retention dam, and eventually back around to the road you went up in the first place. It&#8217;s a nice ride, albeit curvy.<br />
Our first stop was at Lake Minnewanka, where we took a few moments to make use of facilities and take a look around. It&#8217;s a gorgeous little area &#8212; you can even take power and sailboats up there for a cruise around the lake. It&#8217;s a fairly large lake, too, so there&#8217;s a lot to see on water that you would have some trouble getting to on land.<br />
Some of the surrounding hills showed sign of forest fire. To keep Banff National Park (and other surrounding areas), conservationists started controlled fires to burn out some of the material most likely to burn. It&#8217;s a little unsightly, but helps with the forest life cycle and promotes new, healthy growth.<br />
One thing that&#8217;s been discovered in recent years is that, despite the obvious damage, forest fires are a necessary part of life in the forest. New growth can&#8217;t start in old growth forests. Although environmentalists cry out at the thought of burning an old forest (can&#8217;t say I blame &#8217;em, either), the canopies are often too dense to let light in to spur new trees. When the forests burn, the canopies are destroyed and nutrients (in the form of ash) are returned to the soil. Though it takes a few years, the resulting forest is just as strong and healthy as the previous one.<br />
As an additional note: logging does not appear to have the same benefits as burning.<br />
Anyway, we didn&#8217;t stick around too long at Minnewanka, as there was a severe lack of picnic tables. So we decided to head on down to Johnson Lake, in hopes of something there. The road was mostly empty, save for the odd car. Normally, the area would be full of campers. An influx of grizzly bears has put a stop to that for now.<br />
Johnson Lake was slowly beginning to fill up. We arrived early enough, however, to acquire a picnic table in the shade. Considering that it was quite warm outside, this was a definite benefit &#8230; the breeze that blew in off the lake also helped.<br />
The portable propane barbecue was set up (open fires are pretty much verboten throughout Western Canada at the moment) and lunch started while Jen and I went for a little wander around the area. The next time I go back, I&#8217;ll have to make sure to wear shoes (I was wearing sandals) and return when all the trails are reopened (closed either for safety reasons, specifically bears, or for environmental protection).<br />
The six of us sat under the trees, fending off the odd bee and trying to keep Maggie from barking at everyone or eating out of our hands. Aside from the nigh-indestructable table, the experience was pretty much prototypical picnic.<br />
Following our lunch (the table was open for all of 10 seconds before another family swooped in on it), we headed out for Banff Townsite. Like the picnic area we had just left, Banff (Bamf!) was full of people and cars. (Although we managed to get a parking spot on Banff Ave.) Such was to begin our afternoon of shopping.<br />
There&#8217;s only one thing that will truly keep me from shopping: other people. And I&#8217;m not referring to too many other people &#8212; shopping in crowded malls (especially during Christmas) has always been a fun thing to do. The problem wasn&#8217;t mine, so much as it was Nana&#8217;s and Mom&#8217;s. They&#8217;re not exactly the Andretti brothers when it comes to walking down crowded sidewalks. And with the heat, Mom&#8217;s mobility wasn&#8217;t exactly stellar.<br />
Much to Jen&#8217;s dismay, we made it only down one side of the street before calling off the shopping spree. Nana was the only purchaser. We had debated on going to the Banff Springs for a drink on the patio. Then it was the Rose and Crown in Canmore, as there would be far less tourists there. But as we approached Canmore, we decided it was better to have drinks in Calgary.<br />
I fell asleep on the way home. I guess I&#8217;d had too much mountain air for one day. (And I had woken early to tackle some house painting.) I snapped out of my slumber at the Calgary city limits.<br />
That night, my family feasted on Thai from the King and I. What amazed me, at first anyway, was that Mom was keen on trying it. But somehow, it hadn&#8217;t registered with her that &#8220;Thai&#8221; was Asian. And Mom&#8217;s not a big fan of Asian foods. She did eat some of it, though.<br />
That was my Saturday. I can sum up Sunday in one word: Painting.</p>

		<p>The weekend past was the August long weekend. Well, it was the long weekend for most people. For me, it was one of three things: painting the house, spending time with family, or being at work.<br />
Four things, if you count sleeping.<br />
Mom arrived in town Wednesday afternoon. Her arrival was what had fuelled my desire to paint the house. The idea was to have the whole thing painted in time for her arrival. Yeah, my ambition&#8217;s pretty sizeable. I figure: Go big, or go home. I might have made it, had it not been for a couple of work-related things that came up and threw me off-target for time.<br />
Wednesday night I spent with Mom, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jen. Thursday night was here at the office, dealing with project work. For the first time since I started doing overtime at Critical Mass (on my second day on the job &#8212; see [[My First Entry from Critical Mass]]), I wasn&#8217;t programming. I was doing the things I used to do before I came to Critical Mass: document editing and formatting (and a little writing and editing).<br />
What was I working on? We&#8217;re doing the single largest pitch in the history of Critical Mass. And I can&#8217;t tell you who it&#8217;s for, so don&#8217;t ask. All I can tell you is that if we do win it, the contract will fundamentally change Critical Mass. It&#8217;s that big.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Aren&#8217;t I Mercedes-Benz Boy? I&#8217;m still working on our single largest account, no worries about that. But it&#8217;s been a slow year for us, and I had the opportunity to contribute. I also offered to assist with the document construction.<br />
Why did I do that? Well, for those of you who know what I used to do, it&#8217;s probably a bit of a surprise. For those of you who don&#8217;t, allow me to tell you why I&#8217;m a web developer. After graduating university, I became a Technical Writer (something I&#8217;d started doing on co-op work terms). I did technical writing for six years in total. Towards the end, I hated it so much I sometimes felt like a coyote caught in a trap, and wanted to gnaw my own hands off.<br />
While at Radical Entertainment, I started pushing myself more towards web development. I&#8217;d already been doing it for a number of years, so it wasn&#8217;t that big a stretch. Owing to a need to leave Vancouver, I came here. Based on a recommendation from my friend Scott, I applied at Critical Mass and the rest is history. But what isn&#8217;t commonly known is that while I was waiting for word from Critical Mass about my position, I was actively avoiding several technical writing positions.<br />
That&#8217;s how much this pitch means to Critical Mass. That&#8217;s how much I was driven to go back to doing what I used to do. That&#8217;s how I ended up in the office on Thursday night, most of Saturday, and all of Monday (8:00 to well after 22:00).<br />
That&#8217;s how I remembered how much I hate Microsoft Word.<br />
Friday night was the first of what will likely be many family dinners while Mom is out visiting. (Not that I&#8217;m complaining in any way.) But it was Saturday that was the big event &#8212; the birthday party for my Aunt Brenda. I won&#8217;t tell you how old she is, but it&#8217;s the one that causes people to put 50 pink flamingos on your front lawn.<br />
It was supposed to be a surprise party. It was supposed to be a grand little affair where we get her to scream in delight, etc. But I seem the only living person in my family able to organize these things without the guests of honour finding out. Aunt Brenda almost planned her entire party. Were it not for me being a royal pain-the-ass, she would have spent a good portion of it in the kitchen preparing food. I started banning her from the kitchen.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t easy, either. Aunt Brenda&#8217;s kitchen is a magnet for her. Every time I turned my back, she was back in there. I actually uttered: &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me come in there!&#8221;<br />
She did.<br />
I ended up finally kicking her out and handling the things she would have done, like making the best darn corn bread on the planet. It&#8217;s a heart attack in a pan, but it&#8217;s worth the potential coronary. I have *got* to get that recipe one of these days.<br />
The next day, I woke up a little early (for a weekend) to resume painting. It&#8217;s finally cooled off a bit, and it allowed me to tackle painting the front of the house &#8212; the only side I wanted to do before Mom saw the house. (I still have to do the west wall, but you can&#8217;t see it unless you&#8217;re in my neighbour&#8217;s yard.) I even got several of the windows finished up.<br />
Painting a house can be a bit of a Zen thing. (&#8220;Zen and the Art of Decorative Trim&#8221;?) I&#8217;ve had several people tell me that it might be great to have tunes blaring while slapping down a coat of paint. I have yet to have a radio turned on. And when I&#8217;m using the paint sprayer, I can&#8217;t hear anything else.<br />
House painting, in some ways, returns you to your youth. Especially when you use latex paints. It doesn&#8217;t stick to glass, plastic, or skin. It makes you feel like that creepy kid in second grade who put Elmer&#8217;s Glue all over their hands so they could peel it off like a layer of skin. It&#8217;s especially fun in the shower. Doesn&#8217;t matter how dried the paint is &#8212; a little warm water and soap, and *poof* there&#8217;s a clump of sloughed-off paint skin on the shower floor.<br />
Mom, Aunt Brenda, and Jen appeared around 14:00. Mom was being dropped off while the other two checked out &#8220;Johnny English&#8221;. Mom, Tamara and I chatted in the backyard for a while, listening to some jerk across the alley scream his head off at another tenant about unpaid bills and broken windows. It was an argument I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in listening to, but had little choice.<br />
Mom half-guilted me into cleaning up the yard a bit while we sat out back. Mostly cutting back all the suckers growing from two trees and the lilac bush. Admittedly, though, it did look better. Then it was back to painting.<br />
As Sunday was Aunt Brenda&#8217;s actual birthday, we all went out for dinner at a nice homey Italian restaurant along 17th Ave., Buon Giorno. Definitely not the swankiest restaurant in Calgary, but they make a good meal. Try the scallops &#8212; their chef cooks them to absolute perfection.<br />
My cell phone rang at 7:33 Monday morning. It was Chicago. Although I&#8217;d been on call all weekend, this was *the* call I&#8217;d been expecting. I was in the office 10 minutes later and editing. I had hoped to paint that morning. No matter. The worst that would happen was I&#8217;d be editing until 16:00, at which time the documents were off to Kinko&#8217;s for copying.<br />
Or at least that&#8217;s what I thought.<br />
The morning was sheer chaos and panic, especially when I saw the state of the appendix. It would take a phone call with Heather to put my mind at ease, especially when I realized that not everything in the appendix was supposed to be formatted.<br />
More problems with Word trying to do things I didn&#8217;t want it to do. These are problems that Microsoft has never removed. And before you go saying: &#8220;Must be a problem with the user&#8221;, when I first detected them with Word 97, I stumped the tech support guys in Redmond, WA who were unable to solve the problem. You&#8217;d think after six years, they&#8217;d fix the damn thing.<br />
Final call came sometime after 22:00 last night. I was tired. I hadn&#8217;t felt that tired as a result of office work in a very long time. But the pitch is off to the hopeful client-to-be. Now we just have to wait a half a month to find out if they want to take us to the second round or not. I hope there&#8217;s not as much pressure as the first round.<br />
My idea of pressure on the second round is the kind sealed by bottle cap.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I need a weekend from my weekend. &#8216;Course, it&#8217;s my fault for trying to do so much at once.<br />
For the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been preparing to paint my house. (The outside, that is.) I should have painted it last year, as my home inspector suggested (see [[Meeting with the Home Inspector]]), but I had a few things that kinda got in the way ([[Moving into my New (Old) House|moving into the house]], [[My Housewarming Party|my housewarming party]], [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding|a wedding]], and the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC 50th Anniversary train</a>). By the time I could have done it, the weather was too cold.<br />
Once the roof was reshingled (an expensive but necessary repair), I set down to start painting. I didn&#8217;t have to strip all the paint off, but I did have to remove paint from around the windows and the front door. Most of it had disintegrated and really needed to be replaced. The rest I can paint over.<br />
Weather and a few too many activities last week delayed my start, which I pegged as Saturday. However, I had forgotten about one little detail: I&#8217;d already promised to help my friends Fritz and Jin move into their new condo.<br />
This, I might add, I was more than happy to do. Fritz had helped me move last year ([[Moving into my New (Old) House]]), so this was my turn. Luckily, Fritz didn&#8217;t have anything truly awkward (except maybe the futon), so it was just a matter of hauling things around. There were five of us actually moving things: Fritz, Doug, Adrian, Godfrey, and myself. Jin was still frantically packing when I arrived just after 9:00.<br />
Fritz appeared minutes after me, carrying breakfast. (Had I known, I wouldn&#8217;t have hit Tim Horton&#8217;s before coming over.) Scarfing down a sausage McMuffin and a hashbrown, we proceeded to cart down boxes, tables, cabinets, beds (in pieces, of course), sheets of glass (from the tables), chairs, bags of who-knows-what, candlesticks (big ones), lights, paintings &#8230; we wouldn&#8217;t taken the doors, the toilet, and the kitchen sink if we could have gotten away with them.<br />
The hardest part of moving is going out. Because everything is spread out, it&#8217;s hard to gauge how much room they&#8217;ll take in the truck. Although Fritz had rented a medium-sized U-Haul, it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear how well everything would fit. Having moved too many times for my own good, I was confident that we&#8217;d get everything there in one trip.<br />
Slowly, but sure, the truck began to fill up. Godfrey had brought his pick-up truck, which would end up carrying a spare bed and a bicycle. Adrian&#8217;s Golf carried the TV and the computer. My Mini carried the glass from the tables. The truck was filled quite well, but far from capacity. We could have quite easily packed in many more things, but ultimately there was no need for such efficiency. Besides, Fritz and Jin don&#8217;t have that much stuff.<br />
(In fact, that ended up being a debate: who had more stuff in their move? Tamara and myself, or Fritz and Jin? We couldn&#8217;t decide.)<br />
The new condo is quite literally that &#8212; new. In fact, it&#8217;s still being finished. The condo was supposed to be ready last year. An accident set off one of the largest fires seen in Calgary, destroying most of the complex, and damaging a few units that had been finished years earlier. (Critical Mass&#8217; HR director fled home when she found out to save her cat. Luckily, her unit was spared damage.)<br />
The smell of fresh paint, carpet adhesive, and fresh-cut wood permeated the air. Banging could be heard from nearly every direction. (The crews have been working non-stop to finish the condos.) Our first obstacle was finding a place to park &#8212; the streets around Fritz and Jin&#8217;s condo were littered with construction vehicles. We ended up in a no-park zone.<br />
Next obstacle: stairs. There were no ramps, no direct access to the lobby. The architects weren&#8217;t particularly bright on that point, in my opinion. Lucky, nothing was particularly heavy. All we had to do was reverse the process (significantly easier) and move everything into the condo.<br />
Unpacking the trucks and cars would have taken less time than packing, were it not for the stairs and an elevator that were &#8220;in the way&#8221;. But even with that and Godfrey&#8217;s early departure, we still finished the move in about four hours. There was only one causality, a floor lamp that appeared to have had the threads stripped from one of its joints. (The lamp still works.)<br />
The move over, Fritz returned the U-Haul, and we headed over to Fujiyama for a post-move meal. Adrian, Doug, Fritz and Jin would return to the condo to sort out the contents. I, however, had a house to paint. Or more specifically, needed to get supplies with which to paint.<br />
Luckily, I knew what I wanted. Basic white paint, a can of green for accents, a couple of brushes, and a paint gun. Yeah, I know &#8212; what do I really need a paint gun for? Why not use brushes, right? Well, considering the amount of painting that I&#8217;ll need to do on a (semi-)regular basis, I think the cost of the paint gun will far outweigh the time I&#8217;d have to spend painting by hand. And it&#8217;ll save wrist strain.<br />
One other thing that I needed to get, which I determined after an inability to borrow one from someone, was a power washer. Every single site I read and every person I talked to said that I had to wash my house before applying the paint, otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t stick as well. Trips to Wal-Mart and Canadian Tire revealed models running from $129 to over $800. I settled for a little 1200 PSI Karcher.<br />
Rent? Oh yeah, I could have definitely rented both. But I&#8217;d have paid for it in the long run. The paint gun would have run me up quickly, to the point where I&#8217;d have paid more for renting than for owning. As for the power washer, the only rentals were gas-powered monsters that could strip not only the paint but probably some of the wood. (For the record, 1200 PSI is *plenty* for washing dirt, etc. from a house.)<br />
Changing into my painting clothes, I set about to wash down the house and prepare to start painting the next day. For the next three or so hours, I proceeded to get very wet and very dirty. I had paint chips, dirt, insect carcases, water (of course), and Heaven-knows-what-else rain down on me as I removed all the gunk the house has been collecting since the last time someone took the time to do the job. I&#8217;m reasonably certain it wasn&#8217;t the last owner.<br />
With the house dripping wet, there was nothing I could do until the next morning. Tired from a day of moving and cleaning, I opted for a steak dinner. On my way to the store, I felt the need to obtain a cold beverage with which to relax. Imagine my shock and delight when, wedged next to Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown, I found the long-missed lime-green packaging of Steam Whistle Pilsner. Life was definitely getting better.<br />
Originally planning to rise at 8:00, I evicted myself from bed around 9:00, opting for an extra hour of rest. Saturday still had me worn out, and I had a long day ahead of me.<br />
Task #1: Read the instructions for the paint gun. The last thing I want to do is screw the thing up. With the early morning, it was an ideal time to try and paint a portion of the house not easily seen &#8212; the north cupola (containing the bathroom) wall. This requires me to climb onto the roof on my fancy-schmancy ladder. (It bends in three places to help me do just what I was trying to do.)<br />
This is when I found out just how steep my roof is, and how there was no way I would have been able to reshingle the roof on my own. In fact, the roof is so steep that I couldn&#8217;t even climb off the ladder (which bent onto the roof) and climb up on my own. The shingles don&#8217;t help &#8212; they&#8217;re flat so there&#8217;s no grit on which to gain a foothold. I only managed to paint part of the small wall. As it was more a test than a task, I didn&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
As a result of my resounding non-success, I realized that I needed a paint roller to reach the more inaccessible areas. Either that, or mountaineering gear so I could climb up the side of my roof. Either, I resolved to paint the rest later.<br />
The rising sun prevented me from tackling the rear or east walls. (I&#8217;m leaving the west wall for sometime later, when there&#8217;s less pressure. You can&#8217;t see it unless you go into my neighbour&#8217;s yard, anyway.) I wasn&#8217;t too keen on doing the front of the house until I had a little more practice with the gun. I decided to give the stripped windows their first shot of green paint.<br />
About 11:30, I broke for a shower. Nana had invited me to the grand opening of her condo complex in the north end of town, and I wasn&#8217;t about to show up looking like I&#8217;d just done battle against a flock of birds with the runs.<br />
Nana lives in a retirement complex. Basically, an apartment building for people with not as much mobility as they once had. The amenities include a cafeteria (with pretty decent food, I&#8217;m told), nice views of a small man-made lake, exercise room, library, theatre (and a darn nice one, at that), and a wonderful little courtyard. The complex is next to a new strip-mall that has an IGA, various little shops, and 17 food service establishments.<br />
Nana fed me lunch. It was supposed to be a BLT, but I don&#8217;t like raw T. In fact, I can&#8217;t stand &#8217;em. I can eat T any other way, just not raw. So I had a BLC (cheese). It was still yummy.<br />
The party started around 13:00, and we hung around for about 45 minutes. It seemed to be little more than just a gathering. There seemed to be no official announcements, or greetings, or ceremony of any kind. Nana opted to give me the guided tour of the facilities in lieu of waiting around for something that didn&#8217;t seem to be happening.<br />
We ended up at the balcony at the end of her hallway, just down from her apartment. The balcony looks north across the lake. It&#8217;s a wonderful view, even if it is towards another complex being built on the north side of the lake. We sat and talked for almost an hour before I took my leave to resume my house painting.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t go right home &#8212; I made a stop by Revy to pick up the paint roller, tray, and an extension so I could reach those hard-to-reach places. I didn&#8217;t even get in the main entrance when my cell phone rang. It was my friend (and realtor) Robyn. Robyn has taken it upon herself (bless the woman) to be a matchmaker, and I&#8217;m her latest project.<br />
It was a set-up. I knew it was. Just like Thursday night, when we&#8217;d met for drinks down at the Barley Mill. Unlike that time, however, plans were fairly definite: a movie at 19:05 where I&#8217;d meet Robyn&#8217;s mysterious woman. (We have talked on the phone &#8212; an impromptu Robyn set-up, when we were at the pub.) Although it was a movie I&#8217;d already seen, I figured that I&#8217;d like to meet this woman, I could stand to get out for a while, and besides &#8212; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; is actually a pretty good movie.<br />
Back at the ranch, I unpacked my newly-gotten booty, and got on with the show. The east wall was now in the shade, leaving me to start painting. I opted for the middle third of the wall, which is the section the cupola runs off of. The rollers helped me get the very top, which even my rather-long step ladder can&#8217;t reach. Of course, I got almost as much paint on me as I did on the wall and overhang.<br />
Reaching the level, it was time for me to change and prepare for the movie. (Note: I do not use the word &#8220;date&#8221;. It was a group event, as to remove any pressure.) Just as I was about to walk out the door for the trip up, my phone rang. It was Robyn. It appeared that my mystery woman had developed car trouble, and had decided not to go. This pretty much eliminated my desire to go out, since I could finish more painting.<br />
When I explained to Robyn that I&#8217;d rather paint, she was disappointed. But when I mentioned that I&#8217;d already seen the movie, she squealed in delight. I was willing to go see a movie I&#8217;d already seen just so I could meet a girl! I suddenly felt like I was in high school again. (Of course, this sort of thing *never* happened to me in high school.)<br />
Back into my painting gear, I tackled the rest of the east wall, and slid around to the east side of the south wall. I shut down the paint gun for the night after that. Although very fast, it&#8217;s quiet noisy and would probably bother my neighbours. I opted to give the windows a second coat of green, and apply a first coat to the window sills on the east wall.<br />
The sunlight gone along with the remainder of my energy, I went for a late dinner. I already knew that today was going to be rough. My arms are sore (from holding a fully-extended paint roller at a distance), my feet are killing me (standing on ladders), and I&#8217;ve got paint edged under every fingernail.<br />
And I&#8217;ve still got about 3/4 of a house to paint.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve often heard it said that there&#8217;s nothing like the sound of pitter-pattering around your home. This weekend, I found that sometimes this sound isn&#8217;t so nice. Like when your hot water heater is leaking.<br />
I noticed it in the early afternoon on Saturday, shortly after the third load of laundry had finished in the washer. There was a hissing noise emanating from the basement. I assumed at first that this was from the heater reheating. But the noise didn&#8217;t stop.<br />
Further inspection &#8212; actually *looking* at the heater &#8212; revealed hot water leaking from the relief valve. This was the first time I actually had a mild panic as a homeowner. How the hell could I stop/fix this? I knew a little of hot water heaters, but not enough to fix one. Luckily for me, my sister married an original Mr. Fix-It.<br />
A phone call to Ontario found my sister and brother-in-law in the glow of having just finished the installation of their kitchen skylight. Cathy was a tad surprised to hear me ask for Craig. (Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around.) Craig gave me a few ideas as what to do, and some ideas of maintenance. The first step: hook up a garden hose and purge the tank. While purging, open the valve a couple of times and clean it out.<br />
The relief valve on a hot water tank is a very simple (but very vital) piece of equipment. A hot water tank runs at about 150 psi. While that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, if a hot water tank were to explode at that pressure, you could say good-bye to your house and everything in it. That&#8217;s what the relief valve is for. It&#8217;s set to open at 150 psi and bleed off excess pressure before something nasty happens.<br />
Except mine was just open. After purging the tank, the leak was even worse. Another call to Ontario. This time, I removed the valve from the tank. That&#8217;s when I found the culprit of all my problems. Although I can&#8217;t tell for sure, the inside of my tank seems to be lined with about a half inch of calcium deposits. If ever there was an advertisment for water softeners, this is it. The temperature probe on the valve was so encrusted, and I had to pull quite hard to get it out.<br />
Thus began my repair project: immersing in a glass full of CLR and trying to get the thing to work properly. My grandiose plans for hitting the gym and getting in a little exercise before events in the evening were rapidly going to pot. By 19:00, the best I&#8217;d been able to do is a slight (but still noticeable) leak. And that was with a lower temperature. At least I could have a shower.<br />
I left for a party hosted by Chrissie, a fellow co-worker, around 21:00 &#8212; the valve returned to its CLR bath for the next 15 hours.<br />
While we wait for the valve to soak, let me tell you about this party. Chrissie, a long-standing CM employee, wanted to throw a &#8220;nothing to do with Stampede&#8221; party. For those of you not in the know, we&#8217;re currently immersed in the Calgary Stampede, which means the invasion of this city by every cowboy wannabe in the world for two weeks of &#8230; well, probably the best explanation is drunken stupidity. I&#8217;m really glad I no longer live right downtown.<br />
Held in the southeast quadrant of town, Chrissie is in an area that I had previously thought I wouldn&#8217;t want to live in. But her house was gorgeous &#8212; owned and renovated over a few months by Capri and Jason (other co-workers). They&#8217;d done it mostly for fun. (Yes, they&#8217;re both crazy.) It made for a great party venue.<br />
The soiree had a fairly healthy cross-section of the company, new to veteran, programmer to artist. And three DJs (two of whom are on my WebDev team) who kept the tunes running for the next few hours. There were about 60 people there, though it was hard to get an accurate count &#8212; people kept coming and going all night.<br />
One of the key reasons was to jointly celebrate Cory and Laura&#8217;s birthdays (both on Sunday). And hey, like we really need a good excuse to get together and have fun. The trick is just to avoid talking about work.<br />
Shawn came out, too. It was good to see him again. Shawn&#8217;s been on leave for a couple of months, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to his return at the end of the month. It&#8217;s just been too quiet without him around.<br />
I value Shawn&#8217;s opinion, mostly because he&#8217;s about as genuine as they come. Towards the end of the evening, Shawn and I were talking on the couch, when he mentioned that it was good to see &#8220;the Old Sowrey&#8221; again. I was a tad confused at first. I know I&#8217;m among the older folk in the WebDev group, but I didn&#8217;t realize I&#8217;d become the &#8220;Old Sowrey&#8221;. But Shawn qualified this by adding that the &#8220;New Sowrey&#8221; had worried him.<br />
Basically, Shawn had remembered what I was like in my first year and a half here. I was loud, obnoxious, and apparently a lot more fun. In the last year, I&#8217;ve become much more business-oriented, more focussed, and apparently a lot less fun. The thing is &#8212; I agreed with Shawn&#8217;s assessment. My ambition to rise in the ranks had led me to reforming myself to be more &#8220;appealing&#8221; to those who would promote me. I succeeded (far more than I thought possible) in that aspect, but inadvertantly led me to failing in another.<br />
The team dynamic is everything. No-one gets into the WebDev group unless they&#8217;ve got the attitude to go along with the skill. It was that attitude that I&#8217;d slowly been killing over the last year. I&#8217;ve actually become *too* professional.<br />
Before you start objection with this analysis, I&#8217;ll point out that this was not some snap decision. This was a bit of a revelation (even if it was someone pointing out the obvious), and I did spend some time truly thinking about it. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m going to have to keep an eye on. I want to be a professional, but the last thing I want to do is have that get in the way of having fun with my teammates.<br />
We left the party around 04:00. We knew we were ready when Cory just upped and walked out the front door. I&#8217;d stopped drinking about two hours earlier, knowing that I&#8217;d be driving people home. Originally it was just Shawn. But Candace abandoned Cory at the party, meaning he&#8217;d need a lift home. And Reid, who&#8217;d somehow managed to hang out that long, asked for a ride since he wasn&#8217;t far from Cory&#8217;s place.<br />
The ride back to Cory&#8217;s was fairly quick, though he lives at the south-west edge of town. At four in the morning, most of the intersection lights are blinking (amber on the main thoroughfare, red on the minor ones) &#8212; only major intersections have their lights still in normal operation. Which was good for Cory.<br />
We hit our only red light when we got to Southland and MacLeod. Cory, sitting in the front passenger seat, nonchalantly turned and opened the door. At first, I thought he was going to get out. (Cory was still quite loaded at this point, and I&#8217;ve seen drunks do weird things at early hours of the morning.) Cory leaned over, but not to get out of the car. He cursed me later for taking so long to stop at a light.<br />
As Shawn and I returned to downtown (Shawn lives not too far from my house), we noted that the sun was taking an awfully long time to set. It was then we realized that it was so late that it was early. Already, I knew that my sleeping schedule was going to be really screwed up for the next couple of days.<br />
Meanwhile, back at the hot water heater&#8230;<br />
Awaking around 13:00 (having gone back to bed after Jim called me at 10:15 to play disc golf, which I sleepily refused), I returned to the hot water tank problem. The valve had sat in CLR all night, and was glistening clean &#8212; no more rust or calcium. Figuring this was good, I taped it up and slapped it back in. A couple small drips.<br />
Fixed, right? Wrong. There shouldn&#8217;t be any drips. So it was off to Revy to get a new valve, and some piping for a drain pipe (the previous owner didn&#8217;t have one). Luckily, this stuff is so standard it was almost ridiculous how fast I picked up the valve, a 3/4&#8243; adapter (for the pipe), a connector, a three-foot section of copper tubing, and a plumbing soldering kit (I didn&#8217;t have one yet, and it was as good an excuse as any to get one).<br />
Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t purchase the valve with the intent to replace it right away. Actually, I had hoped the dripping would stop while I was gone. I might have been able to deal with a periodic drip, but when I raised the temperature to its normal setting, gushing water sealed the fate of the valve. It had to go.<br />
Luckily, my father had taught me how to install plumbing when I was a kid. I&#8217;m no expert, but I can handle most of the simple stuff. Probably couldn&#8217;t do a home improvement show, but as far as a pressure relief valves go, I&#8217;m good as gold. All I have to do now is sit back and wait to see what will go wrong next.<br />
My bet&#8217;s on the furnace&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Canada Day, most people take the time to go do something special, like visit events in their local community or town, possibly visit one of Canada&#8217;s majestic national parks (which are free today), or visit the local taverns and have one of Canada&#8217;s national beverages with friends.<br />
Me? I hang around with trains.<br />
Okay, before everyone gets all over me for doing &#8220;the train thing&#8221; again, I have to say that this is for the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, not me. Given the choice, I&#8217;d probably have hung out in and around the just-reopened Prince&#8217;s Island Park for the day. I probably would have avoided the killer sunburn I managed to get on my face. (You&#8217;d think that since I planned ahead and brought sunblock that I&#8217;d use it. Shows how much you know!)<br />
Every year on Canada Day, the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (I&#8217;m going to write &#8220;RMRS&#8221; from herein &#8212; it&#8217;s a long name to type) puts on a &#8220;show&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a show, but a chance for us to connect with some of the local enthusiasts, show off some of our equipment (the &#8220;Eagle Springs&#8221; combine car &#8212; no, not the farm type, a beautiful 1930&#8217;s passenger car, and our Alco S-3 diesel. This stuff usually just sits in Calgary because we can&#8217;t normally do anything with it. But on Canada Day, not only do people get to see this stuff, but they get to ride it, too.<br />
Starting last year, Don managed to get us into the old CP Ogden Shops (now the Alstom Shops) to hold our show. It&#8217;s very handy, since that&#8217;s where our equipment is being stored here in Calgary. It&#8217;s also convenient, since there&#8217;s a plethora of rail equipment from multiple owners all over the massive complex.<br />
We&#8217;d been out twice before Canada Day, getting things ready. Last Wednesday, it was vacuuming the cars and general clean-up. Yesterday, it was preparing the display and getting things roughly set up. And making a few repairs to CP&#8217;s display cars (graciously donated for the day so there was more than just our stuff around) &#8212; during switching, someone had flattened the railing needed to hook the stairs to get in. Nothing a blowtorch, sledgehammer, and prybar won&#8217;t fix.<br />
Don&#8217;t try this at home, kids, we&#8217;re experienced professionals. (We do this to 6060 all the time.)<br />
This morning was gorgeous. Which was great for me, since I had to spend the first 45 minutes awake in the gym. Arthur (friend, co-worker, and workout buddy) has put me on a new torture regimen. He claims my butt&#8217;s going to be in severe pain tomorrow. I truly hope not. Especially with all the walking and standing I did today&#8230;<br />
A massive volunteer crew &#8212; the largest I&#8217;ve ever seen for the RMRS &#8212; was beginning to assemble when I arrived at Ogden just after 11:00 (ironically enough, I was delayed by a freight train). Thus began an hour of hurried unpacking, setting up, moving of heavy objects, taping off areas verboten, and making sure everything was ready after the various cars were switched into their locations. CP loaned us the use of a SW 900 diesel-electric switcher (#6711), their historic mail car (#3266), and towed the train down the south side of the Ogden yard for about 2200 yards before returning, to give people a little ride.<br />
The crowd we got was a lot larger than I thought it would be. We don&#8217;t publicize this (for a variety of reasons), so we don&#8217;t get a lot of people. Still, most of our chairs were filled. It was pretty impressive, I think. We had the deputy mayor, the head of CP&#8217;s Heritage division, and representatives from the RCMP out to represent not only rail history, but of course, Canada&#8217;s history. It is Canada Day, after all.<br />
The afternoon shot by. Before I knew it, the clock read 16:00, and everyone was gone. We packed up, shunted the cars, and were ready to go home just after 17:00. Which was great, because my head was killing me.<br />
That&#8217;s when I realized I&#8217;d had too much sun. Tomorrow&#8217;s gonna hurt.</p>

		<p>Heat arrived in Calgary this weekend. It&#8217;s been warm here for a few weeks now (off and on, anyway), but this was the first really hot time in the ol&#8217; town. Which, of course, is a perfect excuse to flee the city for a day.<br />
A few people in Calgary (like, half the resident population) are out this weekend. Half of Critical Mass took today off so they could get a nice four-day weekend (counting tomorrow&#8217;s national holiday). I suspect the rest of Calgary ain&#8217;t much different.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I got a rather interesting surprise: an email from an old friend, still living in Vancouver. It appears that a couple of weekends ago, my ex-girlfriend (and ex-fiancee) got married.<br />
When I read this rather interesting piece of news, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little sad. I no longer harbour feelings towards her, one way or the other, but I found I still do for her family. I grew quite close to them when we were together, and perhaps the most pain I felt when I left was from my betrayal of their trust.<br />
No doubt I am no longer a consideration in their lives, nor should I be. I suppose that thought/feeling alone makes me sad. What is my future? I have a good job, a home, a nice car, I exercise regularly, have more friends than I really know what to do with, and have led my life as I choose to direct it. In fact, the last three years have been extremely good to me &#8212; the death of my father notwithstanding.<br />
But I come home to an empty house. I&#8217;ve got a roommate I hardly see anymore (a boyfriend and a new life outside of Critical Mass have contributed to that), and two cats. Though I love them all, they won&#8217;t share in my experiences or adventures. I have no-one to hear my victories in battle, no shoulder to cry on. Almost three and a half years. Longer than I was in any relationship.<br />
The closest I&#8217;ve come to that sort of a relationship is with Chris &#8212; possibly my dearest and closest friend. (Anyone willing to tell me I&#8217;m full of crap when I start doubting myself can&#8217;t be anything but a close friend.) Since he&#8217;s moved away, the hole in my life seems to get bigger. I try to fill it with things: new websites, trains, work, exercise. Not even the largest freight train can span the gap that I sometimes feel splitting me apart.<br />
Such was the feeling I got when I found out my ex is a married woman. There are a lot of people who believe I should feel a lot of animosity towards her. I did, three years ago. I had a lot of anger. Back then, I honestly didn&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;d feel any different as time went on. But the saying is true &#8212; time does heal all wounds.<br />
Today, I sit here and type nothing but best wishes for her and her new spouse. I hope that their lives together will be long and fruitful, that her family is happy and well. Perhaps this is the end of a chapter of my life &#8212; the last few threads tied off that allows me to move on. I don&#8217;t think this was holding me back, but that&#8217;s the strange thing about the subconscious: you never really know.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are certainly worse ways to spend Friday the 13th. There are certainly more healthy ones. But when Critical Mass decides to throw a party for its employees, you can be sure of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lot of laughs.</li>
<li>There will be a lot of drunk people. (That kind of leads back to #1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I should point out, for the record, that the New Year party was extremely tame. I have no idea why specifically, but it was the first time I haven&#8217;t seen at least a few co-workers completely loaded.)<br />
Unlike last year&#8217;s little surprise (see [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]]), the staff knew that this party was coming. What they didn&#8217;t know was where it was going to be. There were many theories: Sylvan Lake, Calaway Park, Banff, even whitewater rafting. Most were discounted due to distance, cost, and safety. One location that had circulated a few times was COP &#8212; Canada Olympic Park. I assumed it would not be there, since I assumed (rather poorly) that there was little for us to do there. Little did I know&#8230;<br />
Our morning began a little earlier than usual. For me, it was with a little more responsibility &#8212; I had to take a staff photo. In the six years that Critical Mass has been in business, there has never been a staff photo. This was the first time since the Kelowna trip (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]) that we&#8217;ve had everyone in the same place at the same time.<br />
Since we laid six people off last week (including my roommate), we are without an &#8220;official&#8221; photographer. I guess I&#8217;m the next in line (can&#8217;t imagine why), so I was asked to take the picture. To allow this, Darrell (the VP of Operations) arranged for me to gain access to the roof of the next door building and shoot across the parking lot. Two great things about this: the angle is perfect, and the sun in the morning is great.<br />
The bad thing? Organizing that many staff is like herding cats. Which is why I was very happy to be just outside of comfortable shouting range.<br />
Pictures in hand, we boarded our busses for our unknown location (which we would soon find out was COP). We were grouped into five teams: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, White. (These are representative of the Olympic colours, of course.) This not only organizes us, but creates the groundwork for the competitive in-your-face attitudes that we generally lack in the office.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s a chance for us to completely mock each other.<br />
The line at the bar formed as soon as the busses arrived. It took less than a few minutes for us to be kicking back in the main tent, drinking our beverage of choice (usually one of Corona or Heineken), and getting into the groove of the day. Pat and I both remarked that in some ways, the day was reminicent of the Kelowna trip &#8212; starting the day off with beer.<br />
What I would find was that as the day went on, the more I felt like I was not in Calgary. The company had whisked us away to parts unknown to engage in a weekend of total debauchery. It wasn&#8217;t to the same scale as Kelowna (I&#8217;ll be very impressed if we ever see that again), but there was so much energy from having the entire day to do (pretty much) as we pleased that everyone seemed to forget that we were (at the core) just co-workers.<br />
We began our mini-Olympics around 10:00. The events were fairly simple, and none too difficult. (They were designed to be played by the dozen or so pregnant women currently at the office.) They included Bocce-Curling (get your ball the closest to the target), Cookie Stacking (stack Oreos as fast as you can in 30 seconds, using only one hand), Channelz (using five half-pipes, run a ball around an obstacle course, moving the ball from one channel to the next every 20 feet), Memory (remember what a bunch of articles are), and Balloon Toss (tossing a water balloon between two people, increasing the distance every throw).<br />
Oh, and there was one other event. As we arrived, 10 people volunteered for a &#8220;special event&#8221;. No-one knew what it was until it started: a Scavenger Hunt. A lot of people who didn&#8217;t volunteer wanted on, and a few who did volunteer wanted off. The details of the whole thing are still sketchy. We didn&#8217;t see the Hunters until just before lunch.<br />
Although I was part of Team Yellow, I spent most of my time running around between the various events, taking pictures. I gotta say: drinking beer and running don&#8217;t mix well at all.<br />
Participants were well-behaved. For about five minutes. I mean, come on! Put a bunch of people (mostly men, admittedly) in the vicinity of filled water balloons, and well, you&#8217;re gonna have some trouble. Suffice to say, every team that left the Balloon Toss went to their next event armed. It&#8217;s a good thing we had a sunny, warm day &#8212; a number of people got a wee bit damp. (Fortunately, our adolecently-minded staff had the decency not to aim water balloons at the women in white shirts.)<br />
Things calmed down a wee bit come lunchtime. That&#8217;s when everyone put their guns down and loaded up on food. (You&#8217;d be surprised how much acting like buffoons works up an appetite.) Nothing overly fancy &#8212; just hamburgers and salads.<br />
After lunch, we were left to our own devices. Some people went off wandering, some played mini-golf, and some went to play beach volleyball. The rest sat around and chatted. Resuming my photo run, I proceeded to find interesting things to take pictures of. For some reason, I started with beach volleyball.<br />
The five courts are wedged in the last curve of the bobsled/luge track. Unlike most of the other courts I&#8217;ve seen, these had more than the 2-3 inches that you end up driving your foot through into pavement. I took the opportunity to run around a bit and get a few action shots of people playing.<br />
My first memory card full, I took a moment to rest before heading back to get the second one. That&#8217;s when Ed suggested I come play with them. Still being inebriated enough not to know any better, I hopped out on the court.<br />
Now, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright idea on my part. My head (along with the rest of my body) was still swimming in ol&#8217; ethyl. The actions of volleyball &#8212; whipping the head around following the ball, diving, rolling, yelling &#8212; combine against your brain&#8217;s better judgement to stay in one place and lie down. Needless to say, it&#8217;s quite the argument my body got into.<br />
While in the midst of a set that I don&#8217;t really remember, I caught a glimpse of water balloons arcing over the trees. The angle required to get the balloons over the trees was so great that the balloons never came close to the courts. That didn&#8217;t stop me from annoucing (rather loudly) that if anyone hit my camera with one of those balloons, it would be the end of them.<br />
That statement would be my downfall.<br />
About 20 minutes later, Allard (my boss) caught us in between serves to borrow my little camera. Or rather, I thought that&#8217;s what he was looking for. In reality, he was checking to make sure I was camera-free. I hadn&#8217;t seen the audience on the hill carefully hiding my big camera.<br />
Next thing I know, there&#8217;s a line of people standing on the hill. They were in plain view. You know those old cowboy movies where the angry Indians all stand in a line at the top of a ridge? It was like that, only with water balloons. And no Indians.<br />
Somehow, instinctively, I knew to run. It didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; apparently, I&#8217;d earned the privilege of being the prime target. Two balloons bounced off me, but one made a direct hit in the front, followed moments later by one in the rear.<br />
Neil ran past. (Although he still claims his innocence, I have witnesses as to his involvement.) Picking up the two balloons, I chased him all over the courts. Then Neil got smart and stopped. Before I could do anything, he&#8217;d burst the balloon in my hand, and stepped on the other. Now balloon-less, there was only one other thing I could do: chase him.<br />
For all I know, I had a blood-curdling rebel yell as I chased Neil up the hill. Someone yelled out: &#8220;Tackle him! Go for the legs!&#8221; Remembering snippets of high school gym class, I dove and grabbed the legs. From what Arthur tells me, it was a textbook tackle. All I know is that the whole effort wore me out, and there&#8217;s no video evidence.<br />
I walked around damp for most of the afternoon (like I said, it&#8217;s a good thing it was warm), constantly shedding dried grass and sand from the escapade in the volleyball court. Although I can&#8217;t say I was the wettest that day, you could put me in the top rankings, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
The winners of the games were announced towards the end of the day. I wasn&#8217;t particularly paying attention, having reached what I can only assume was the bottom of my bottle, figuratively speaking. Team Green won, partly due to their skill (I can only assume) and subterfuge (which was widely known). Hey, it&#8217;s just a game&#8230;<br />
We returned to the office to begin the *second* event of the day. Thought we were over, didn&#8217;t you? Ha! If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s when to stop. Hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing&#8230;<br />
Vicious Circle was our next port of call. We didn&#8217;t all arrive at once, but before long a large portion of the company had packed themselves into a seat somewhere. And at Vicious Circle we sat, talked, drank, snacked, and took strange pictures of everyone who was there. And then suddenly, almost without warning, people began to filter out into the night.<br />
Torin, Adrian, Jim, and myself headed to Ceili&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not too sure why. We ran into a couple of people from CM, but after a quick search for anyone else in the building, we found outselves alone. This meant it was time to vacate. The problem, however, was that during our search, Jim decided it was time to get another beer. (For those of you who think *I* was far-gone, you needed to see Jim.) We didn&#8217;t much want to wait for Jim to finish his beer. No problem for him &#8212; he just slipped the 3/4-full pint into his pants pocket.<br />
Out the door and down Stephen Ave. &#8212; we were headed to SkyBar, where we knew the rest of the crew could be found. We didn&#8217;t get much further past Penny Lane when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: Sean, aka Muck, aka my cousin Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. Pam, of course, was right there. We talked briefly (the others were waiting for me, and I couldn&#8217;t very well wait around too long) before resuming our quest to SkyBar.<br />
When we reached 1st St., Jim disappeared. We were across the street from Murrietta&#8217;s, one of the cooler bars/clubs downtown. That night, they had a live band playing p-funk (basically, horn-driven music). Jim blurted something about it, and next thing we knew, he was gone. We waited around a couple of minutes, but Jim was gone. (James and I would discuss this the next day &#8212; James received two completely unintelligable voicemails from Jim over the course of the night.)<br />
Torin, Adrian, and I continued to SkyBar. There we ran into Cyndy, Ashifa, a couple of Marks, and other people I don&#8217;t quite remember now. SkyBar cover was $15. We weren&#8217;t objected to it so much as we were STARVING. Conveniently enough, Saltlik was next door. On the order for a late-night snack: a peppercorn steak.<br />
It was midnight when we hit the streets again. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, had at least that many beers over the course of the day, been water-bombed, run ragged, and my feet suddenly decided to tell me they were ready for revolt. As much as I would have liked to go up to SkyBar, my body cried out in defeat. It was time to go home.<br />
The lights were off, and nobody was home. (Except the cats, of course.) I assumed Tamara was out having her own breed of fun that night. For some reason, though, I felt the urge to look for a note. I found one on my computer keyboard: &#8220;Back in a few days. Enjoy your weekend!&#8221; I laughed, though probably more from being too tired. I crawled into bed next to Spaz, who was rather upset that I was making her move.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait for next year!<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Okay, before you all say &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s Geoff and his trains again!&#8221;, I would like to emphasize &#8212; for the record &#8212; that I only did this because the Society was desperate for people.<br />
The Society, of course, is the Rocky Mountain Rail Society. But you&#8217;re thinking I was up working on 6060 all weekend, guess again. I remained in town &#8230; at Heritage Park. The Park is a recreation of life in a prairies town/city circa late 1880&#8217;s to around 1910 or so. Depending on where you are in the Park, you&#8217;ll see roughly appropriate recreations. (I think only a few things in the Park are authentic &#8212; most were rebuilt from pictures and plans.)<br />
One of the things Heritage Park has done for the last 17 years is hold something called &#8220;Railway Days&#8221;. It&#8217;s a draw that brings out more people to the Park, and causes the local modellers and rail hobbyist organizations to come out and show off their things. Naturally, this brings out the Society to show off what we&#8217;ve got, raise a few bucks for funding, and hopefully snag a few more members.<br />
Don, who organizes all the local events (I sometimes wonder if he actually sleeps at nights), asked me to be there most of the weekend &#8212; all of Sunday. I didn&#8217;t have any firm plans otherwise, and agreed. I arrived an hour early Saturday morning, expecting to have to go through the rigamarole of setting up the displays. Everything was already in place when I arrived.<br />
I had an hour to kill. This gave me an excellent chance to wander around the Park. I haven&#8217;t seen much outside of the roundhouse, coach house, and the main street. I didn&#8217;t go for a huge walk, but got a better idea of what the Park is like. Luckily, the weather was infinitely better than last year&#8217;s (for once, I have no entry to link to!) &#8212; it was bitterly cool and rainy the entire weekend, keeping the people away. On Saturday, we had bright, sunny skies, and though it started off a little cool, warmed up very nicely.<br />
We were put into the roundhouse, along with the other commercial interests. This was a little disheartening &#8212; we&#8217;re not commercial. We&#8217;re non-profit. We sell things, yes, but just to earn some money so we can pay for projects we need to do. As it stands, we only made $600 for the weekend, and our profit margins on that stuff is quite low.<br />
Of course, we&#8217;re not there so much to make money. Our goal is to raise awareness. We&#8217;ve been around almost 20 years now, but we&#8217;re not known outside the rail community. Even within the community, we regularly get stories that 6060 has been permanently retired and put up on static display. It&#8217;s particularly a challenge when we&#8217;re told this to our faces at trade shows.<br />
It&#8217;s so much easier when you can roll your steam locomotive into a town, pop open a door and announce &#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8221;<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have too much trouble with people finding us. As the roundhouse is a fairly major attraction, and we were right next to the door, we had a steady stream of visitors both days. Last year, we were in the Coach House, which is virtually buried behind the railway tracks and beyond the roundhouse. Unless you happen to see the signs, you are definitely going to miss it.<br />
Oh yeah, assuming you haven&#8217;t already figured it out, Heritage Park has its own self-contained railway. It&#8217;s nothing particularly fancy &#8212; a big loop with a turntable and roundhouse, a siding for storing the &#8220;freight&#8221; train, and two stations. Two locomotives ply the rails on Railway Days (usually, it&#8217;s just one), both 0-6-0 switchers. They&#8217;re painted as CP 2023 and CP 2024.<br />
It&#8217;s with some irony that in a CP town, Heritage Park ended up with two small steam locomotives originally from (of all places) the US Army. Both started off with the Army, moved to New Westminster in BC where they worked the docks until the mid-60s. They eventually found their way to Heritage Park where they were fixed up and put to use. (They were originally US Army #4012 and #4076.)<br />
Heritage Park does have two actual CP steam locomotives: another 0-6-0, #6144, which now operates with a diesel engine; and CP 5931, one of two preserved Selkirks (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Canadian Railway Museum]]) &#8212; the largest locomotives used in Canada. (There is widespread belief 5931 could run again, but the politics behind doing so dwarf the massive engine by many times.)<br />
Amidst people coming and going (and Don running around to help out with the presentations), I made a couple of opportunities to go take pictures. When you&#8217;ve got two steam locomotives double-heading (basically, running end-to-end), you make an effort. Especially if the weather&#8217;s good.<br />
Early afternoon arrived, and we had so many people at the booth that I didn&#8217;t see a need for me to be there anymore. So making sure all was well, I ducked out to enjoy the rest of my afternoon.<br />
Sunday, it rained. It was raining when I got up, it rained off and on until just before lunch, and then rained pretty much consistently for the rest of the day. Naturally, this staved off the numbers of people we&#8217;d seen the day before, but it wasn&#8217;t *so* bad. It gave us more time to watch the videos we show constantly.<br />
I spent all Sunday at Heritage Park. It wasn&#8217;t the most rivetting way to spend the day, but at the same time I can certainly think of worse things to do.<br />
Besides, I got to watch the trains.</p>
