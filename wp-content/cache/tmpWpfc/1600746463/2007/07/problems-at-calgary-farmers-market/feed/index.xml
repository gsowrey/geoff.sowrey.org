					<description><![CDATA[What’s really going on at the Calgary Farmers market is: vendors were asked from the old market to help them build the market by investing $100 a square foot. In the lease these vendors had,  they indicated they would pay so much and no more. When the market got itself into financial problems instead of fixing their own problems they broke the lease agreements with the vendors and demanded illegally more money. Some vendors left the market most are trapped because they have thousands of dollars invested. We had invested $50,000. Market raised our rent from $36000 to approx. $58000 in the first year.  When we were forced out the market they refused to pay us our initial investment and now we are perusing the matter in court. The arrogance and for lack of a better word sleazy way of the market is they do not even respond to a lawyers letter for the monies they owe people. Allot of people like that market but really they have no idea how disrespectful the market is to vendors who supported them for years and helped them build the market.
Myself I stay away from the Calgary Farmers Market just because I do not support business that treats calgarians so poorly. Especially out of towners.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Geoff,
I have to confess, we&#039;ve recanted our stance against P&#038;S. We did some digging and found out that they&#039;re not a massive chain -- they just look the part. They&#039;re much more down to earth, and make a good cuppa joe.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Phil and Sebastian are local boys committed to making amazing coffee.  I avoided them in the beginning because I liked Bit o&#039; Beans so much but the boys at P &#038; S have got it together, it&#039;s the Starbucks-like crowd that sucks!!]]></description>
