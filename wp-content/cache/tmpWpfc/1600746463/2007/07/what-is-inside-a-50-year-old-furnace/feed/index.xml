					<description><![CDATA[I just finished removing the 50-year-old furnace/AC. I bought the place last January. However, I knew it was eventually going to have to be done. The furnace was made by Singer. The real estate agent gave me extra CO detectors for free and stressed that I use them. These were sure signs of a furnace replacement in the horizon.
I pulled quit a bit of metal from that unit and outdoor condense. I am hoping to recover some money in scrap value. Meanwhile, I await the new furnace, drip the faucets, and heat with a portable during the day. It was 22 degrees last night...brrrr.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When we lived in Winnipeg several years ago, the furnace had to be replaced in the house we were renting.  The old one was close to the size of two refrigerators, and the new one was just a little bit larger than a dishwasher and WAY more efficient.  As you say - lots more room!
Hmmmm - I wonder just how old our furnace is........]]></description>
