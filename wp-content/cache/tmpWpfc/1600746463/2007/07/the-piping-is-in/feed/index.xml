					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Not really. Yanked most of it because it was in the way of a variety of things, and probably a lot bigger than it needed to be. There&#039;s bits and pieces left (notably the stuff in the crawl space under the kitchen extension), but otherwise almost all removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m planning to replace it with things more efficient/effective.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t know yet. Not Canyon&#039;s field of expertise, so I&#039;ve got to find one. Was going to call Eldo Enterprises for quotes, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you recommend one in particular? I&#039;m admittedly weak on that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Codes are different city to city(i&#039;m in Edmonton) but since you already have a poured basement they propably could care less on how efficient it is.  A note of interest though which you can mention to Canyon... every new house system I&#039;ve sold in the last 5 years and our competition.. Bartle and Gibson, Emco etc.  All have either BFB or foam insulation if there&#039;s infloor in the basement.  I would presume it&#039;s the same for them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve also challenged Canyon to justify the non-insulated direction. Curious to see what they come back with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though as an interesting point of note: the City has approved the installation as-is. Would the use of insulation not be a required point that should come up during inspection?&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah.. tucking between the piping segments is kind of useless.  On any suggestions now.. I&#039;ll ask around and check.  Email me a list of your equipment being installed too and I can give you some pro&#039;s/con&#039;s to what your using.  I&#039;m constantly researching Hydronic Sytems since that&#039;s being a big portion of my companys sales for the last 8 years.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hmm... that&#039;s a rather interesting point. I just assumed that the heat would stop at the ground under the concrete, being a transitionary layer. Given that the piping is already ramsetted the floor, could something be slipped under? I assume tucked just between piping segments wouldn&#039;t be effective.
We&#039;re pouring 1.5&quot; of gypcrete (the height of the 2x4s and 2x6s defining the footing plates), which by your description doesn&#039;t sound like enough. I&#039;m a little leery about pouring more concrete, though. (Mostly because I don&#039;t have the framing done yet, and can&#039;t finish until the concrete is all in.
Anything I can do to improve the situation without a) ripping anything out, or b) pouring a lot extra?
Thanks for the input, by the way! I just wish I&#039;d heard it a few days earlier! (Oh well, can&#039;t win &#039;em all ... it&#039;s still better than forced air, though!)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Suprisingly it seems to.  The comments i&#039;ve seen and heard from homeowners and contractors through my company, show that gas bills seem to be significantly lower with some sort of insulation.  In the industry we call using no insulation as &quot;Sink Heat&quot;(heat going down the drain).  Ground(basement) cement is always cooler then normal areas. To get the cement to actually radiate would take an unusual/abnormal amount of heat as there&#039;s no limit to how far the heat goes down before radianting up to the area desired. An example I&#039;ve told clients is to stick a hot plate on your concrete... then on a place mat on the concrete... you&#039;ll see and realize quite a difference.
On the issue of how the floor bonds is a great question. If your only pouring an inch of concrete or gypcrete you will have issue&#039;s as your floor would be unstable with BFB. If Ceiling hight is an issue you could glue 1/2&quot; high density foam(Some Rona&#039;s carry this) to the floor which is also quite commen.  Depending on the thickness of the concrete there&#039;s different options.]]></description>
