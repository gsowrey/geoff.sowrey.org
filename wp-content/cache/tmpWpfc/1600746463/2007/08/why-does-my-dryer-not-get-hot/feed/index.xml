					<description><![CDATA[Sorry about the delay, Amanda.
Sounds to me like the same problem I had -- making sure that your breaker spans phases in the panel. From what I&#039;ve gathered, you&#039;ve got two hot lines that must be out-of-phase for your dryer to actually get hot. So long as you&#039;ve spanned phases, it doesn&#039;t matter which of the two wire connect to which pole in the plug. You&#039;ve got four poles (two hots, a neutral, and a ground), and the hots are interchangeable.
Can you poke around in your panel and see if that&#039;s the issue?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, just poppiong in here trying to figure out why my dryer doesn&#039;t pump and heat?  I&#039;ve found lots of troubleshooting info however I think my case is slightly different and was wondering if you might beable to shed any light.
I have recently just moved to a new home.  I bought a washer and dryer (used) and found that the dryer didn&#039;t pump heat although it seemed to work in all other areas.  I thought i just got ripped off and bought a second used dryer (electric) from people I know wouldn&#039;t have lied about their dryer working.  Again, no heat!  I&#039;ve read abit about the heating coils or fuses blowing but in two machines?  I&#039;m wondering if it could have something to do with the power box/receptical since its unlike that i would&#039;ve broken two dryers in two days!
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
please feel free to email me.  loopyky@hotmail.com
Thanks

					<description><![CDATA[Geoff,
You are bringing memories back to me big time..... my neighbor helped me walk Bob&#039;s desk outside the house and around to the walk in basement so I could put up the crib and paint the nursery upstairs...... Bob did not think we needed to move his office!!! Friends of ours loaned us a solid cherry cradle and Bob insisted on
setting it up right next to his side of the bed in our BR..... when Kara arrived, Bob almost killed himself getting out of bed..... he forgot that the cradle was right next to his side of the bed..... he had insisted on placing the cradle there because he had already had children and I had not had any..... therefore, what could I possibly know!!! Need I say more??? Parenthood is a constant learning experience..... it is wonderful..... good and bad. Keep in touch. Please tell Alexa that childbirth leaves wonderful memories to relive.  Kara is now 26 years old and just bought a town house/condo outside Washington, DC.  Don&#039;t know where the time went.

					<description><![CDATA[Sigh... we&#039;re barely started on the baby&#039;s room. Lack of free space owing to the basement delays has compounded all the problems. We need to get something on the Gypcrete so we can move stuff downstairs and make room to finish.
But we&#039;re also planning on having the wee one in our room the first couple of weeks to make the hourly feedings and diaper changes easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Not really, no. It was pretty minor. Doesn&#039;t harm anything, but you just get no heat. Technically, the air moving through the dryer does dry things, but it takes a LOT longer. ;)
Yeah, but I think I&#039;ve finally sold Alex on gas. So nothing beyond an ordinary plug is needed. :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if &quot;little thing&quot; is appropriate when in reality it was a rather big thing don&#039;t you think?
FYI - if you&#039;re getting a new stove, it too needs a special outlet - but you probably already knew that!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Judging by the nicknames I grew up with, you can do a lot with &quot;Sowrey&quot;. But most of those I don&#039;t want to put up here. ;)
And I&#039;m reasonably certain that if Holmes ever came through my basement, I&#039;d probably fall into the category of those renovators he hates. I&#039;m nowhere as good as he is, but I&#039;d like to think I&#039;m at least effective.]]></description>
