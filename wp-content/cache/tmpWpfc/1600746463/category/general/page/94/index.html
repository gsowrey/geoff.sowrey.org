		<p>It seems that good things do happen to those who wait. Surprisingly enough, that also applies to me.<br />
You may recall some weeks ago, [[The Hell of my job|I lamented Critical Mass&#8217; ability to see the need to promote from within]]. It wasn&#8217;t so much about me as it was about using the resources we had, and not stalling forever on putting people into open positions.<br />
I kept raising the red flag. I was, well, a kind of whistle-blower, but only in reminding management that we were rapidly heading for a serious problem if we didn&#8217;t fill the position that I knew needed to be filled. I bugged Allard, and I bugged Cory. I wanted to make sure that we would have some sort of movement on the issue.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have officially become mobile. Today, I picked up the keyboard for my PDA, and am able to create my log entries wherever I am on the planet.<br />
And have an electrical socket to recharge the batteries. (Minor detail.)<br />
Wait a second &#8230; you probably have no idea that I have a PDA. Actually, I&#8217;ve had a PDA since 1996 &#8212; an Apple Newton. It was given to me by my boss when I worked at Arkipelago in Toronto. When I left, my boss told me to keep the Newton.<br />
I used it for a couple of more years, but it slowly fell out of favour with me, mostly because it wasn&#8217;t as convenient as I would have liked. The major issue was size &#8212; the Newton is a size of a thinnish brick. Weighs about as much, too.<br />
I did without a PDA for years. For the last three, most of my notes were written just like everyone else&#8217;s &#8212; on notepaper. The more notes I wrote, though, the more likely I was to forget things. Finally, upon taking over the Web Development team on Mercedes-Benz, things finally got too much.<br />
I take a lot of notes, and can sometimes get lost in details &#8212; no different than anyone else. I can&#8217;t allow myself to forget too much, though, lest it impede my job. I finally decided a PDA which could sync itself with my daily schedule was what I really needed.<br />
Research. Anything that&#8217;s gonna cost me more than $100 requires research. I had a set of requirements that I needed to fulfill. One was the need for handwriting recognition. I didn&#8217;t want to learn a new alphabet &#8212; like the Palm systems force you to do. I also wanted something that would synchronize with my calendar. That brought me to looking mostly at Pocket PCs.<br />
These things run on Microsoft software. That I&#8217;m not particularly thrilled about, but I have to accept the fact that to get what I need, I sometimes have to make sacrifices.<br />
After about three months of research (periodic, not continuous), I came to rest on two models: the Dell Axim X5, and the Toshiba e330. The Dell was the superior model for functionality and expandability, but was quite a bit larger. The Toshiba was smaller, but more limited. About equal price.<br />
It finally came down basically to a coin toss. The coin was tossed the night I replaced my watch battery &#8212; the store (Battery Plus) had a Toshiba. I nearly closed the store from all the humming and hawing. It came down to a demonstration period.<br />
According to the clerk, I had two weeks in which to decide if the PDA was what I needed. During that time, I could do whatever I wanted. So long as I didn&#8217;t damage the unit, I could bring it back for a full refund if I felt it wasn&#8217;t for me. It hasn&#8217;t been two weeks yet, and I&#8217;m sold.<br />
As the saying goes: so far, so good. Well, almost. When I first picked up the keyboard today, I couldn&#8217;t get it to work properly. Naturally, my first impression was that it was defective. Not wanting to retain a defective piece of equipment, I decided to pay Staples a visit (that&#8217;s where I bought it).<br />
I didn&#8217;t immediately ask to return it. My first initial thought was to check and see if, just perhaps, I wasn&#8217;t using it correctly. (Hey, it&#8217;s possible.) I got the feeling the clerk had been through this before, and promptly asked if I&#8217;d installed the software.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t even aware the keyboard had additional software. It stood to reason, though, that if the appropriate driver wasn&#8217;t installed, some of the more advanced functions of a keyboard might not work.<br />
Frankly, I don&#8217;t consider the enter key to be an advanced function, but I had to give it a shot.<br />
Whipping off to the office, I pulled in the PDA and inserted the CD into my desktop computer. A moment later, the software was installed. A test of the keyboard revealed that nothing had changed. A little puzzled, I hunted for some setting that might shed a little light on the problem.<br />
It turns out you have to enable the keyboard before you can use it. Doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me, but hey &#8212; if it works, then great!<br />
So I now have an almost completely portable website content-creation machine. Now if I can just figure out how to hook my camera into this thing&#8230;</p>

		<p>Normally, around this time of year, I rant about the really dumb decisions the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science makes when awarding their own. Normally, it&#8217;s because they give Oscars to those who &#8220;deserve&#8221; the award, not those who&#8217;ve earned it.<br />
Not this year. This year, I actually have to praise them for making the hard choices.<br />
Last night, I convinced Tamara and her friend Todd to watch the Oscars. Didn&#8217;t take much &#8212; all I had to say was that &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221; was up for Best Documentary. That was enough in Tamara&#8217;s books to watch the rest of the ceremony. We missed the beginning of the show, but came in just as the awards were beginning.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s get most of the nitty-gritties out of the way. Best Animated Feature Film could only have been Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s &#8220;Spirited Away&#8221;. Having seen all the other nominees except &#8220;Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron&#8221;, there was but one choice. Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Chris Cooper and Catherine Zeta-Jones) gave me no reason to argue (though I might have preferred John C. Reilly in &#8220;Chicago&#8221;). &#8220;Chicago&#8221; scooped most of the primo awards, but considering the competition, that wasn&#8217;t all that surprising.<br />
But the night was a rollercoaster of surprises. Unlike previous years where the winners were always predictable, this series seemed to play to the underdogs and renegades of the industry. Adrien Brody winning Best Actor for &#8220;The Pianist&#8221; threw a lot of people &#8212; I was expecting Daniel Day-Lewis. (Not that I&#8217;m arguing with the choice.) Eminem taking out music heavyweights like &#8220;Chicago&#8221;, U2, and Paul Simon was extremely welcome (although the guy who accepted could have least had the decency to wear something better). The Best Original Screenplay went to a foreign film, &#8220;Talk to Her&#8221; &#8212; an Oscar rarity. And despite all the controversy, Roman Polanski won the coveted Best Director.<br />
Nothing was more surprising, and more pleasing, than hearing &#8220;Michael Moore, &#8216;Bowling for Columbine'&#8221; being read out. Both Tamara and I cried out in joy. Frankly, I thought Moore&#8217;s chances of winning were virtually none. Heck, I was shocked that he was even nominated! (Though I had a personal note never to watch the Oscars again if they didn&#8217;t nominate the movie. I guess someone listened to me for a change.)<br />
If you&#8217;re wondering why I was shocked about the nomination, you obviously haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;Bowling&#8221; or know who Michael Moore is. The guy is possibly the single most politically-charged firebrand in the States at the moment. (Even previous Academy Awards where Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon made statements barely even come close to what Moore did.) In &#8220;Bowling&#8221;, he asks a lot of hard questions, though finds it almost impossible to actually get them answered. He even confronts Hollywood heavyweights Dick Clark and Charleton Heston. Both come out looking a lot dirtier as a result. Heston takes a cinematic beating, however, retreating from Moore&#8217;s questioning by merely walking away.<br />
For those insults, I thought Moore&#8217;s changes of a nomination were nil. Okay, so he gets nominated &#8212; no chance he&#8217;ll win. The institutionalization of Hollywood won&#8217;t allow it. I would kill for a video tape of the production booth when &#8220;Bowling&#8221; won. The producers probably dove immediately into recovery mode. Because as soon as the standing ovation ended, and the quick thank-you was done, they knew that Moore&#8217;s political views would turn the heat up inside.<br />
Hell of a way to get a ratings boost, though.<br />
So the speech was barely cut short (Adrien Brody actually managed to get an extension, but finished his war speech far more tactfully than Moore&#8217;s), but the point was made. I think that&#8217;s all Moore really wanted to do. I don&#8217;t think he returned for the rest of the evening. Mind you, after his speech, producers might have just avoided showing him again. Steve Martin (the host) joked that Teamsters were helping Moore into the trunk of his limo. It was Moore&#8217;s first Oscar, and my guess is that it&#8217;ll be his last. Something tells me, though, that he won&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
I want to thank the Academy, for doing the right thing for a change!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long time, but I&#8217;ve gone back to school.<br />
The last time I took a class (see [[Why I Don&#8217;t Want to be a Technical Writer Anymore]]), it was for work. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything I didn&#8217;t already know, and I wasn&#8217;t really all that happy about it. This time, I&#8217;m taking something I have (some will say) far too much interest in, and (so far) have been really happy with. What is this wonderous education that I&#8217;m receiving? What is this subject in which I&#8217;m so engrossed?<br />
I&#8217;m going to Steam School.<br />
Okay, you can stop groaning now. Yes, this is related to trains. But not in the same over-the-top manner many seem to expect from me. (Either I&#8217;ve set far too many precedents, or people seem to expect a lot.) It&#8217;s actually an Antique Steam course, which is something I need to take so I can start my safety training for steam boilers.<br />
Why steam boilers, you ask? Remember my girlfriend? (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]].) Well, she needs more people trained to maintain and operate her. There&#8217;s a lot of work involved with running a steam locomotive, especially one with a boiler the size of 6060&#8217;s. And with the bulk of our society getting older every year, we&#8217;re in a pinch to make sure our newer members (e.g. me) have the necessary training.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; the course I&#8217;m taking now doesn&#8217;t even come close to qualifying me to even getting me in the cab while the locomotive is running. As with all things, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Once I&#8217;ve obtained this permit, then I can start working towards my Class 5 permit. That will, at least, get me in the cab during operation. Then it&#8217;s a matter of time and training before I can write my Class 4. I need a Class 4 to operate 6060&#8217;s boiler &#8212; in other words, apprentice to be a fireman. (It&#8217;ll be a number of years before I can be an engineer.)<br />
The class met at Pioneer Acres, a museum in Irricana, about 45 minutes northeast of Calgary. The village of Irricana is small, only about 1,000 people. It was likely once a railway town (the CN mainline &#8212; formerly Grand Trunk Pacific&#8217;s &#8212; to Edmonton runs through Irricana), but has since become little more than a small farming community. The village is surrounded by vast acreages.<br />
Our instructor was late, caught in the snow where he lives. Although a chinook and the onset of spring has pretty much wiped out the snow in most of Alberta, some parts are still in a deep freeze. No-one seemed to mind too much, though. For the $100 fee, a large number of us are having the fees covered by employers or our respective museums and historical societies. It gave us a chance to get to know eacy other a little better.<br />
The instructional material is &#8230; well, not so much in-depth as it is cohesive. Sounds a little odd, I know, but allow me to explain. Although I haven&#8217;t spent a huge amount of time with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, my education started the day I showed up in Warden (see [[Reunion with Steam Locomotive CN 6060]]). Sometimes it&#8217;s just someone telling me the name of a strange blob of cast iron. Sometimes, it&#8217;s telling me how it works. If I&#8217;m really lucky, I get to see it in pieces. However, none of it really seemed to make sense.<br />
The course I&#8217;m in is primarily aimed at safety. Steam engines (stationary boilers, traction engines, and locomotives alike) are all very dangerous. Even a stationary pressure vessel with pressures as low as 20psi can explode with disasterous consequences. 6060&#8217;s boiler runs at 260psi. As you can guess, safety is covered repeatedly during the session. The safety isn&#8217;t so much for us (though that is important), it&#8217;s mostly for the public. No steam engine would exist today were it not for the public wanting to see it operate. They&#8217;re far too expensive to own and operate without funding. So with the crowds we expect come the rules needed to operate them.<br />
Over the last two days, I&#8217;ve received a very clear picture of how certain elements of a steam boiler operate. Most of them to me were textbook concepts. Our instructor make sure that the ideas that once seemed so simple were carefully explained. Luckily, we have several in the class who can explain things a little further. The SAIT instructor even managed to fill in the missing bit of information that finally cleared up how a steam injector operates. (Of course, having some knowledge of physics and thermodynamics actually does come in handy.)<br />
I still get strange looks from friends and coworkers whenever I tell people about the things I do in my spare time. I guess most people expect that I would work on a computer all the time. With my job being close to the leading edge of computer technology, I guess I prefer having a hobby that has nothing to do with computers at all. There&#8217;s a certain amount of relaxation that comes from working with something that predates the electronic age. Something that has no knowledge of microprocessors (the federally-mandated radio notwithstanding), no cares about lines of software code, and no relation whatsoever to the mass-produced garbage of our era.<br />
It might weigh more than 23 times the average city bus, but our nigh 60 year-old toy always seems to lift off the worries of my little world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last October, I bade farewell to my newly-made friends from the CBC Train (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Halifax finale|5 October 2002]] and [[Touring Halifax, Part 1|7 October 2002]]). Since then, I have only talked to them over email and phone. It&#8217;s not the same as being there in person. And I&#8217;ve missed a lot, too &#8212; I get emails from some of them telling me about events and run-ins with the crew. Living out here, I feel pretty separated.<br />
So imagine my excitement when I saw a note from Angela informing me that CBC (specifically Angela and Tracy, who handle CBC Newsworld) were coming to Calgary for two nights of free documentaries. All she asked was that I tell a few people.<br />
I figured about 300 would be enough.<br />
I arrived at the Glenbow Museum at about 18:40, well before the 19:00 start time. Angela and Tracy were holding the inner doors open, and greeting people as they arrived. Simultaneously, it felt like only a moment had passed since I&#8217;d seen them last, and a lifetime.<br />
We talked for a while at the door, I stepping out of the way of arriving visitors. But soon it was time for the movie, and I wanted to go find a seat. That wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; the theatre was mostly empty. Although I had tried to tell as many people as possible, it can take a bit to get Calgarians to go out and do something, even if it is free.<br />
The documentary was &#8220;The Hockey Nomad&#8221;, the filmed version of Dave Bedini&#8217;s &#8220;The Tropic of Hockey&#8221;. (Dave Bedini is the rhythm guitarist for the Rheostatics, and a self-proclaimed hockey fanatic.) A couple years ago, Dave had travelled the world looking for hockey. He&#8217;d found things like a tribe in remote northern China, a national team in Mongolia, rumours of a rink in the Amazon, and things that to even the most aware North American hockey afficianado would sound peculiar.<br />
Such was the case of this movie. Dave and his camera crew visited three places: Ciuc (pronounced &#8220;chuck&#8221;) in the Transylvania region of Romania, ice rinks in the United Arab Emirates, and Ulan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia. He came to do one thing: Play hockey. Dave is a great story-teller, and even a subject like hockey (which can make even the most avid player roll his eyes) was completely fascinating. The story was compelling, and all the while featured a Canadian perspective.<br />
Afterwards, Dave came down to answer questions of the audience, and of a local broadcaster who had his own set of questions to pepper around. Questions were plenty, and the answers interesting. Soon, it was 21:00, and time to wrap things up. I walked over to Tracy and Angela in an effort to see if maybe they wanted to grab a coffee and have a quick chat. They countered with an offer to tag along with their group.<br />
We headed first to Saltlik, hoping to get into the lounge. Completely full, we opted for the James Joyce, just down the road. Tracy, Angela, and I were soon embroiled in our past. I felt kinda bad, though &#8212; they&#8217;ve already been through this with the others in Toronto. I have not. The only person out here is Enza, and I haven&#8217;t had time to get together with her for a chat.<br />
For a time, it almost felt like we were in some dark corner of a bar in the middle of the prairies. (Okay, we *were* in a dark corner of a bar in the middle of the prairies, but that&#8217;s beside the point.) I could have sworn that if I&#8217;d turned around I&#8217;d see Emma, Roger, Amy, Chris, Gerry, the Bills, the Robs, Neil, Jule &#8212; the whole crew doing what we did best: Be together as a team.<br />
It was all over too soon. Work calls as always, and I have early mornings at the gym. I left my part of the tab, and bit Tracy and Angela goodbye. Tomorrow is another movie, which I will unfortunately miss, and then they are off to Edmonton. It will probably be a while before I see them again.<br />
Though the saying may go: &#8220;The world is getting smaller&#8221;, it still seems far too large for me.</p>

		<blockquote><p>One is left with the horrible feeling now that war settles nothing; that to win a war is as disastrous as to lose one.<br />

<cite>Barbara Bush (wife of Fmr. President George Bush, and mother of current President George W. Bush)</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>A little over 12 years ago, I sat on the floor of my bedroom, watching in silence as the Gulf War burst into horrific life. I had been greatly saddened by the events, and greatly worried that our world was about to boil over into something much more serious.<br />
Imagine my shock when I sat down to watch a little television tonight. At 19:45 MST, the White House spokesman stepped onto the podium, saying that operations had begun in Iraq, and the President would be addressing the nation in 30 minutes. I had planned to do some work. Instead, I suddenly felt 12 years younger, and a lot more worried about the future.<br />
When Dubya went on the air a half hour later, I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what to expect. Except for armageddon, of course. Sure enough, through all the rhetoric, the message was quite clear: The &#8220;Allied Forces&#8221; (comprised mostly of America and British forces) had started their attack on Iraq. Exact details weren&#8217;t clear, but from what I could glean from CBC and CNN, the US had launched a barrage of missiles into Iraq as part of a &#8220;decapitation&#8221; strike, trying to take out Iraqi leadership.<br />
No matter how you try and make it sound nice, a &#8220;decapitation strike&#8221; sounds about as appealing as a root canal without painkillers.<br />
I can only imagine what we&#8217;ll see in the coming weeks. No commentator can agree on the details. Some think this will be a fast war, some think it will drag on for weeks, maybe months. Some say the Iraqis don&#8217;t have a lot to offer in the way of defence, others suggest that the Allied forces are outnumbered four to one. They are agreed on a couple of things: the US will spend countless billions to fund this war, and a lot of people are going to lose their lives. And it&#8217;s almost certain that the protests will begin tomorrow.<br />
There are two sad ironies in all this. First, the US can&#8217;t really &#8220;restore&#8221; democracy to Iraq. If they do, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that the electorate will vote in a follower of Islam, who would more than likely not bow to the will of the US. So Iraq will likely be run under a US-positioned puppet. At least until that person decides that they don&#8217;t want to listen any more, start doing their own thing, and bring the US military back in about two decades.<br />
Second, terrorism will likely increase as a result. No-one seems to have considered this part. Striking an Arab nation (even one run by a despot) will only succeed in angering neighbouring nations. Most certainly, this will raise the fur on Al Quaeda&#8217;s back. We can only certainly expect a reprisal at some point.<br />
It&#8217;s debatable whether the Iraqi people are going to be better off as a result of all this. Everyone seems to be speaking of them, but more concerned with their own self-importance and sword-waving. Only the United Nations seems to have a rational head on their shoulders. It&#8217;s too bad that legally, they&#8217;ll have no recourse against the US and UK. It&#8217;s all fine for the UN to crack down on a small rogue nation. But what do you do when two of your most powerful nations go renegade? The coolest heads seem to be coming from France and Germany: Two countries that know all-too-well the horrors of war and of occupation.<br />
I find it interesting that 65 years ago, another nation that opted to force its opinion and will on others started the &#8220;War to end all wars&#8221;. It was horror the likes of which no-one had seen before, and has brought us 60 years of stories (fictional and non).<br />
Actually, I take that back. It&#8217;s not interesting. It&#8217;s frightening.<br />
&#8216;Cuz we might end up with a front row seat.</p>

		<p>I found out today that I&#8217;ve become middle management. I&#8217;ve become my own arch-nemesis.<br />
Critical Mass has (almost) finished its massive organizational effort. It&#8217;s not really a reorganization, per se, but it is a process that we&#8217;ve needed to go through for a very long time.<br />
This year, Critical Mass turns eight years old. It&#8217;s been almost six years since the launch of our first website. I&#8217;m employee #175, and new people are in the #400 range. We&#8217;ve got a lot of people that need organziation to get through their daily lives. So with the introduction of Thelton, our new COO (well, &#8220;new&#8221; as of September), we dove into the melee of putting an actual structure into Critical Mass.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is the first anniversary of my father&#8217;s death.<br />
The last time I saw my father was over a year ago (see [[A Slight Ray of Sunshine on a Very Cloudy Day]]). Since then, all I&#8217;ve had are pictures and the memory of the sound of his voice. I have no home movies, no audio tapes. Just memories that will fade with time, eventually to the point where I can barely remember him.<br />
I no longer speak of Dad in the way I used to. Now it&#8217;s with more reverence, and with more humour. For some reason, I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of using phrases that are prefaced with: &#8220;As my father used to say&#8230;&#8221;, even if I know full well he never said those things. I attribute many of the things I know to him &#8212; most of my home maintenance and renovation skills (most of which, admittedly, is unproven), my (limited) knowledge of automobile mechanics, some of my financial sense (though I have to give most credit to Cathy, also known as my financial advisor), my love of adventure, my desire to travel, and a purpose in life.<br />
Dad didn&#8217;t teach me all these things. I learn a lot through observation. (Hence, my &#8220;Observer&#8221; moniker.) And I certainly cannot mention learning without mentioning Mom. She taught me the rules of life, probably the hardest rules to learn. Mom knew me better as a child than I knew myself.<br />
It&#8217;s been a year without my father. And it&#8217;s been a strange year. A couple of months ago, my family started discussing the possibility of what to do on the anniversary. There had been talk of Las Vegas. Not Dad&#8217;s favourite place, but I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d appreciate the need for celebration rather than mourning. Dad never was a big fan of that.<br />
Hopefully, today will pass without notice. I have no plans to call anyone in my family. Unless I need to. Today, I think all that I may do is find a quiet corner of a bar or pub somewhere, and have a glass of Scotch in my father&#8217;s name.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With Cathy at work, and Craig sleeping for the day (he&#8217;s currently working nights), there was little that would cause me to rise early.<br />
Well, almost nothing. I had a lunch date to keep.<br />
Rising at a reasonable hour, I showered, shaved, dressed, and headed out for the GO Train (thankfully, within walking distance &#8212; though I ended up jogging most of the way there). My ultimate destination that day was the corner of Bloor and Spadina. On the south side, a few blocks west of that corner, I would find New Generation Sushi, where I was planning to meet up with my dear friend Kathryn.<br />
I should emphasize the word &#8220;planning&#8221;. You see, at that point, planning was all Kathryn and I had done. We hadn&#8217;t really *confirmed* anything. I had left a couple of messages with Kathryn, and over the course of the morning, kept calling to see if things were still a &#8220;go&#8221;. But the cell phone wouldn&#8217;t pick up, nor would the land line be answered. Deciding that in the worst-case scenario that I&#8217;d still find something to do, I proceeded with the plan as I knew it.<br />
I hopped the University line upon arriving in Toronto and headed to the Spadina station, mistakenly believing that it was part of the Bloor line station as well (meaning it was near Bloor St.). Of course, it wasn&#8217;t, and was several blocks to the north. No big deal &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t that cold, and was worth the wander. Besides, I was almost an hour ahead of schedule, and had a little time to kill.<br />
I&#8217;ve gotten really good at killing time. I really need to get &#8220;Professional Time Assassin&#8221; business cards printed up.<br />
I found the restaurant, but passed it by in favour of seeing what else I could find in my spare time. Almost reaching Bathurst, I spotted a Starbucks on the north side of the road, and suddenly felt the need for a hot chocolate.<br />
I soon found myself sitting in a Starbucks on the corner of Bloor and Albany, the radiant sun pouring into through the south-facing window, warming my back, the hot chocolate heating my soul. Sitting by the window, listening to Jazz playing in the store, watching Toronto pass by in their daily lives, I felt purely decadent. For a powerfully brief moment, I remembered what I liked about being in Toronto.<br />
Kathryn and I finally connected, and confirmed plans to meet up at the restaurant at 13:30. This meant I still had a little time to kill. So I wandered down Bloor St. back to Spadina, crossing over and coming over to the restaurant. I got a seat for two and started to wait. Thankfully, Kathryn is punctual.<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering how it is that I can meet up with Kathryn at 13:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. Doesn&#8217;t she have to work? In fact, Kathryn is one of Toronto&#8217;s shining stars, and a very busy stage manager. Since leaving school, she&#8217;s done 35 shows of one kind or another. Thirty-five. (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done that many websites.) Her line of work keeps her busy, but usually at night (during production, that is), meaning her days are somewhat free.<br />
Currently, Kathryn is engaged in a play called &#8220;China Doll&#8221;, which is about the Chinese tradition of foot-binding, which ended around 1911. The play starts in the early 1900s and goes until 1917. Had I more time, I think I would have very much enjoyed seeing the play.<br />
We talked for about 45 minutes before finally ordering food. Then we walked for another half hour before the food arrived. We ate, chatted a bit, then talked more. Finally paying the bill, we headed out down Bloor St., still talking. We babbled the whole way into Yorkville, and into cups of coffee and hot chocolate. We chatted until we could chat no more &#8212; and that was only because Kathryn had to go to work, and I had to go meet up with my friend Ed down at Union Station. So we talked all the way to the Museum subway station.<br />
It had been almost exactly three years (give or take a couple of days) since Kathryn and I had spent a significant amount of time together. There had been a bit of time when Kathryn had attended my sister&#8217;s wedding (see [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]]), but because of things that had to happen, we had talked only briefly before she&#8217;d had to leave for a performance that night. Three years. So needless to say, when Kathryn&#8217;s train disappeared into the tunnel as I waited for mine, there was a distinctly hollow feeling &#8212; I don&#8217;t get to see my close friends often enough.<br />
It had been nearly a year and half since the last time I saw Ed (see [[Star Wars and the Last Episode of The X-Files]]), but he hadn&#8217;t changed much. The hair was a bit longer, a little lighter (due to some streaking, so I understand), though he looked a lot more tired than I had remembered. (Given how hard he was working, that wasn&#8217;t too surprising.) We met up and headed off for the 17:34 train to Oakville.<br />
Brian was waiting for us when we arrived. I don&#8217;t really know for sure, but I think the last time I saw Brian was New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1998. Aside from the hairdo, he hadn&#8217;t changed, either. The three of us piled into Brian&#8217;s sports car, and went off in search of a place to hang out for the evening. We ended up at Sharkey&#8217;s.<br />
Sharkey&#8217;s has been a mainstay in Oakville for ages. Apparently, it won&#8217;t be for much longer, as it is slated for demolition. Oakville needs another block of condominiums. But for now, it still reigns supreme on the shores of the 16 Mile Creek, and in the bar, we set up shop to catch up on old times.<br />
Brian and Ed were roommates of mine at the University of Waterloo, living in the Columbia Lake Townhouses. We shared the four-room unit with my roommate from first year, Roger. (Roger is currently living in Prague, so unfortunately was unable to attend the reunion.) The four of us had spent an almost bizarre eight months living under the same roof. It had been together that we&#8217;d witnessed the Blue Jays winning their first World Series, and the Montreal Canadiens winning their last Stanley Cup. And numerous other events, including the Penny Fight, broken shower floors and back doors, watching the &#8220;ducks&#8221;, scaring the hell out of each other, The Neutral Zone, and chemical warfare.<br />
Brian and Ed have had the luxury of seeing each other quite a lot over the last few years. So needless to say, I felt like a bit of an outsider. But it&#8217;s not too bad &#8230; they made sure I felt completely included in the massive string of insults and personal attacks, all good-natured, of course. This was how we&#8217;d conducted ourselves in university, which more and more felt like it was only months ago, not years.<br />
Things have changed over the years, though. We all got engaged, though only Brian, Ed, and Roger got married. I supposedly had enough sense to back out of my engagement before it was too late. Brian is now separated, as is Roger. We joked quite a lot about the &#8220;Columbia Lake Curse&#8221;, and kept looking at Ed to see if he was next in line (for the record, he gave no indication that he was).<br />
Although it was a time I would have gladly continued until the bar closed, both Brian and Ed have to work tomorrow. Such is the sadness of being on vacation &#8212; you can&#8217;t always do what you want to do. But plans are sort of in the works for later this year, as I might be coming out for a camping trip with the guys. It&#8217;s been far too long since the last time I camped.<br />
They dropped me off at Cathy&#8217;s, and I bid them both a good night. I was brought forward into the present, leaving the past of university behind. But it won&#8217;t be the only time on this vacation&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is about this time of year, but I seem to have a penchant for buying expensive things. Last year, I bought a house. This year, I bought my first new car.<br />
For those of you now saying: &#8220;He bought a Mini&#8221;, you would be correct. There are a few of you out there who said I should have bought the Cooper S (the sport version). A little too expensive for me right now &#8212; maybe in a couple of years, I&#8217;ll trade in the one I have. A few of you might frown on my little green bag. Of my favourite deterrents, one even called it a &#8220;girl car&#8221;. Personally, I always thought that was a VW Cabriolet. Call it what you will, this is the only street legal go-kart I know of.<br />
Not even a week ago, I was in the general vicinity of the Mini dealership, and thought I&#8217;d drop in to have a chat with Michael, the Mini salesperson who had been fielding my seemingly endless questions. Unfortunately, he wasn&#8217;t in that night. Another salesperson, also named Michael, chatted me up. We talked about the Mini, and a little about the one I wanted. Michael &#8212; the one I had been talking with before &#8212; had indicated there were a few on-site that might match my needs. Michael &#8212; the one I was talking to at the time &#8212; had some additional ideals.<br />
My criteria were pretty simple: I wanted a cool, distinctive car that had no practical purpose. Yeah, I know, &#8220;mid-life crisis&#8221;. Frankly, if I&#8217;m having a mid-life crisis now, I need help. A lot of it. I think the reality is that I&#8217;m, well, boring. Yes, I&#8217;ll admit it. Dull. Blah. Without any sense of edge. Predictable, even. (Don&#8217;t believe me, check out the comments a few people wrote about me in a survey I sent out a couple years back. See [[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Geoff Sowrey]] for details.)<br />
When Stuart had first shown me a picture of the new Mini a couple years ago, I about freaked. It was perhaps the coolest thing on four wheels I had ever seen. For the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been following the launch of the Mini worldwide, and especially in Canada. For a while, I&#8217;ve lamented living in Calgary &#8212; we were one of the last major cities in Canada to get a Mini dealership. (Saskatoon got one before us. Yes, Saskatoon.) Anyway, about as soon as one opened here, I started looking.<br />
At Christmas, Critical Mass gave me a bonus (why, I&#8217;m not really sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure if I really earned it). While I&#8217;m not at liberty to say how much, it was enough to make me seriously give thought to buying a new car. I guess I need not elaborate on what direction this took me.<br />
Anyway, back to the second Michael. He showed me a model he had sitting in the showroom. It was a demo unit purchased by Mini Canada (Corporate Office) for one of their executives. When they were done with it, the Calgary office purchased it for resale. At a discount. And so began what ended up being a three-day bargaining session. Mini would come to me with a price, and I would turn it around, looking for incentive. It wasn&#8217;t easy &#8212; unlike other dealerships, Mini has the luxury of waiting for the next person to snap up a waiting vehicle. As it stands, I was the first of about five people interesting in purchasing that car.<br />
It&#8217;s British Racing green. (Dark green, for those of you unfamiliar with the colour.) White roof and mirrors. White alloy wheels. Beige leather interior. And really, really, really comfy. So what was the catch?<br />
Manual transmission.<br />
The interesting part is that I actually went out looking for manual. Why? Two reasons. One, it&#8217;s more fuel-efficient than the automatic (a general rule). In fact, the manual transmission Mini Cooper is one of the EPA&#8217;s Top 10 most fuel efficient cars. Secondly, it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t really want to get the automatic. It&#8217;s a CVT &#8211; Continuously Variable Transmission. Basically, no gears. While an uber-cool idea, I was a little paranoid of what would happen if it broke &#8212; how much would it cost to fix? Manuals are less expensive.<br />
Problem: I&#8217;d only ever driven manual once before (see [[Long Weekend in Kelowna, Penticton]]). I know the principle. It&#8217;s just the practice. Which I need.<br />
Now I have one other problem: Where to park it. I can&#8217;t leave the car parked on the road (the city doesn&#8217;t really like that). Naturally, I should park it in my garage. That&#8217;s what I tried to figure out on Saturday &#8212; clean it out, and prepare it for a car. But very early on, I realized I was going to have a major problem: The garage door.<br />
One of the previous owners (I&#8217;m not sure which) decided to sabotage the garage door and remove all the gizmos that let you open and close the door. The door itself is nailed in place. Opening and closing it at present requires two people and a hammer. Not exactly convenient. Closer inspection made me believe that I wasn&#8217;t going to solve my problem with a screwdriver and a mallet. No, I needed a new door.<br />
Off to Revy, where after a few minutes, I happened upon a gentleman by the name of Gerald, who got me the details. Luckily, I have a standard-sized door for my somewhat unstandard garage. It wasn&#8217;t exactly cheap to purchase the door, but I opted also for installation and removal of the old door. I&#8217;ve learned from many people that you simple do not try to install a garage door unless you know what you&#8217;re doing. And aside from the fact that it would take two cars to carry something as large as a garage door, I have no idea what to do with it anyway.<br />
Returning door-less (it comes some time this week), I proceeded to clean out the garage. I succeeded only with the returnable recyclables (we get money back for the containers for which we pay deposits). That pretty much left me incapable of walking, mostly as a result of my first week at the gym. I finished the following day, though not without injury &#8212; I now have a terribly sore throat.<br />
I hate being sick.<br />
Tonight, I signed away what little life I have left after the house, and picked up my new car. This was a good thing, since I was barely able to concentrate on sqwat all day. It took about an hour and a half, including all the financial work, and the walkaround. Yes, a walkaround. You don&#8217;t just drive away from a BMW dealership &#8212; you get the full meal deal. Which is good, because there were a few little things that I wouldn&#8217;t have known otherwise.<br />
I picked up Tamara from home, and we went for a drive. First, to the office to pick up proof of earnings, which I had mistakenly forgot at the office. After faxing that in, we went in search of a Shopper&#8217;s Drug Mart. I needed throat lozenges, very badly. Then it was to Dairy Queen for a quick celebration, and back to the house. As I sit here typing, I can hear the car calling to me.<br />
&#8220;Drive me!&#8221; it coos.<br />
But I need to go to bed &#8212; I have to be up early to go to the gym. I must resist its lures. All I can do it wait with baited breath for the weekend, when I can drive free of the city &#8230; and practice my hill starts without backing into anyone. Maybe I&#8217;ll get Therese and Stuart to teach me.<br />
This time next year, I&#8217;ll have to refrain from anything too expensive. Right now, I&#8217;m thinking of a Snickers bar.</p>
