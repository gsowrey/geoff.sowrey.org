	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not quite five and a half years ago, [[Moving into Critical Mass&#8217; New Building|Critical Mass moved into our current building]]. It was a monumental exercise that required a lot of forethought, planning, and organization. When we moved into the then-new building, we separated into our departments: Project Management (along with Reporting and some account services) on the first floor, Technology (and internal support) on the second floor, Creative on the third floor, with Administration (and some executives) on the fourth floor. Dewi and the Bistro were in the basement.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much how it was from the moment we got in the building. We&#8217;ve moved around a bit within the floors (I changed seats three times, landing in the same desk space twice), but generally kept the department separation.<br />
That was until a couple of weeks ago, when the Leadership Team (which, apparently, I&#8217;m loosely attached to now) called a meeting to announce the next great move. My first thought was that we were going to move buildings again. We know we&#8217;re running low on available space in this building. We need more people all the time, and are running out of places to put them. Sooner or later, we&#8217;re going to have to lay siege to one of the surrounding buildings and take the space for our own. Personally, I&#8217;m all for buying up the self storage building on the next block and installing a connecting walkway.<br />
But this wasn&#8217;t about running out of space. Well, not directly, anyway. This was Phase 1 of making more effective use of our space. And the first step was to do something that many of us veterans have talked about for years: reorganizing the floors so the project teams sit together. I was a little surprised to hear this, as I honestly thought that the idea had been so thoroughly squashed as to not even render a single drop of whine. We were outlined the almost laughably short timeline under which it would take place, and that no-one would officially know until the week before it took place.<br />
(The irony was that most people already knew &#8212; even before I was told, so I gather. It was one rumour I hadn&#8217;t heard before hearing official notice.)<br />
The trickiest part was that we had to sort out the seating plans so administration could rearrange phones and network connections. (The sad part is most people around here seem to only grudgingly acknowledge the Herculean tasks that Administration regularly pulls off without anyone noticing.) &#8220;Tricky&#8221; because most people had their own thoughts of where they wanted to sit. The task of setting the seating plan, however, would be left to the team leads, to minimize the inevitable cacophony over who was sitting where.<br />
Originally, my business unit was to stay on the second floor. Fine for me, as I&#8217;ve been there for years. Creative, however, wasn&#8217;t so keen on that. As a result of discussions with Misch and Jason, we figured out a plan that would work &#8230; and would give me one of the choicest seats on the floor. (I can rationalize nearly anything. Especially when I can get something good out of it.)<br />
Lest you think I purposely positioned myself to get the best seat, here&#8217;s the reality: I wanted to merge our team members, putting PM next to developer next to designer. In my oh-so-educated [insert sarcasm here] view, it was the best way to try and get projects running, by letting people learn from each other across disciplines and departments. That&#8217;s what I wanted &#8230; but I knew it was going to be a hard sell. Mostly because I&#8217;m the only one who wanted it. So we grouped by department, and the most convenient grouping happened to put the Technology group into the southwest corner. Looking at the desk plan, it just made sense to put me in the corner.<br />
Then we had a business unit rearrangement. Dell&#8217;s been getting bigger and bigger, and finally (like Mercedes-Benz and Rolex before it) be ejected into its own business unit. But it wasn&#8217;t just as simple as moving an account. It meant people had to be moved to handle the movement of the other accounts. It meant the Rolex team had to move &#8212; we were bumped to the third floor. And we had to make a very quick replanning to handle the team&#8217;s movement up one floor. As it stands, we more-or-less moved straight up one floor. And due to fortunate happenstance, I managed to snag the corner desk again. Two windows. Goregous view (compared to what I used to have, anyway). And way too much space.<br />
When we left on Friday, everything packed up and labelled, I questioned whether or not this move would go truly smoothly. My key concern was for things like the side tables. They&#8217;re hot property around the office, and as soon as one becomes available it&#8217;s snapped up. Sure enough, when I arrived on Monday, it was clear that monkey business had ensued in the hours before I arrived. I have no idea exactly what happened, but I sure heard about it.<br />
The other thing I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to hear about is the extra space I&#8217;ve ended up with. There&#8217;s a good desk&#8217;s worth of space between my desk and Jim and Scott&#8217;s. Someone&#8217;s gonna complain about that, I know. Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having someone else in there. It&#8217;s too open. I just don&#8217;t know who would want that space. Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed Jason let me have it. He claimed it was a concession for us having to come to the third floor. Like moving into the best floor of the building is a concession into itself.<br />
Overall, the move is a good thing (irrespective of my desk location). I think it&#8217;ll help the teams work better, even if it means departments suffer a bit as a result. But since our end product is work for our clients, not for ourselves, I think it&#8217;ll go to help the movement. But like many things, only time will tell.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember a young whipper-snapper starting at Critical Mass nigh-six years ago. Another newbie, Angie, had mentioned that she&#8217;d brought his stuff out from Winnepeg. Not that I was far off from being a newbie myself &#8212; it had only been a couple of months since I had started.<br />
Since then, Dennis grew from being a quiet little kid to being the single strongest Senior Web Developer we have &#8230; or probably ever had. Dennis and I sat across from each other when we moved to the new building over five years ago. For a year or so, we would chat with each other over ICQ, rarely actually saying anything to one another. We&#8217;d work late almost every night. And we&#8217;d engage in endless debates about technology and management.<br />
Dennis could always code me under the table. He was a better developer, no two ways about it. He scared me back then. I had mastered the ins and outs of developing for Netscape 4 &#8212; a true pain in the arse to support. And the browser equivalent of the evolutionary dead end. Dennis was already well into DOM-compliant development, and object-oriented constructs. He could code a regular expression in his head &#8212; something I can barely do in a regular expression-capable application reading a dummy&#8217;s guide. Despite his age (he was the youngest person at Critical Mass for about three years running), he developed as fast (or faster) than anyone else and kept his own.<br />
A lot of people around here had the impression that I hated Dennis. I have to admit, I have no idea where that came from. Sure, Dennis did pick me off with an eraser once while I was on the phone, but I was just pissed off that someone had done that while I was on the phone! How did they know it wasn&#8217;t a client? In reality, I had &#8212; and still have &#8212; nothing but the highest respect for Dennis. He ran a team easily twice the size of the one I had with seeming ease, and kept everyone running smoothly. Dennis gets higher praise from his team under pressure than I did managing a team under considerably less strain.<br />
I&#8217;m going to miss that devious smirk of his. You&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Dennis is outspoken when he has a particular point of view. He&#8217;s mostly patient, but when he wants to say something, you&#8217;ll see it. He tries not to immediately jump in, but will eventually force his way in. And he doesn&#8217;t come unprepared.<br />
Tabs vs. Spaces. The single largest and most religious of the debates in programming. Which do you use when writing code? The Senior group finally had it out over a month ago. I brought beer to ease the inevitable pain. There wasn&#8217;t nearly as much yelling as I expected. Dennis had his argument for tabs nailed down. I figured he was going to win even before we started &#8212; he&#8217;d prepared himself for <em>months</em>.<br />
Last Friday was Dennis&#8217; &#8220;going away&#8221; binge. A lot of us went to the Ship (and Anchor) to commiserate with our loss. A few of us got into a heated &#8230; no, actually, just drunkenly loud discussion about the past, present, and future of Critical Mass. Those of us who&#8217;ve been around long enough to see the changes (for better or for worse), and speculate on what will be. I do know this much &#8212; you can&#8217;t go home. You can&#8217;t go back to the way things used to be. Times change, and you have to accept that the people you&#8217;ve known and the friends you&#8217;ve made will eventually go the route they need to, even if it is away from yourself.<br />
Dennis was the #3 guy for Web Dev seniority. Now the #3 falls to Torin, who&#8217;s a year and a half behind me. That gap scares me a little bit. That&#8217;s a long gap between seniority. Mind you, we did have some questionable folks in that gap, and there&#8217;s been a long time for them to filter out. But still, it&#8217;s a little worrisome. Mostly because then the next question is: have I overstayed my welcome? It is not a case of there being a gap &#8230; but me staying too long in one place?<br />
D-Money is gone, off to (assumedly) greener pastures. I&#8217;m gonna miss him, too. I miss a lot of people it seems, and a lot more often than I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;ve written too many entries on people leaving. Inevitable or not for our industry, I still don&#8217;t like when it happens.<br />
Take care, Dennis &#8212; keep shaking things up!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ever find yourself providing information to someone as an &#8220;expert&#8221;, where the point of view flows from your lips as easily as drinking a glass of water, and then after you&#8217;ve finished wonder where you learned all that?<br />
Lately, that seems to be happening to me more and more. Someone asks me a question, and I can enter on a diatribe about best practices for creating passwords on application forms, the principles about building websites as best to leverage the content and the technologies, or the best practices in implementing content management when you&#8217;re not even sure what architecture you&#8217;re dealing with.<br />
<em>Where the hell did I learn all this?</em><br />
I think back to my university education. I went to the University of Waterloo. I went there because my high school counselor suggested it. I wasn&#8217;t originally even thinking of Waterloo. I was going to Trent! I wanted to take computer science and rule the world. In Ontario, though, you can only apply to three universities. (There&#8217;s a huge student population, and a lot of universities. Everything goes through a central agency. It&#8217;s weird, but it works.) Waterloo was my #3 choice (I think York was my #2).<br />
I went to Waterloo because they offered me residence, and my parents were adamant about me living in residence. I had no idea what the impetus was for their desire to have me cooped up with 25 late-teen men, but in retrospect I know what they were trying to achieve. My first year at Waterloo remains one of my more memorable. Even today the smell of stale beer still bring back visions of walking down halls in Village 2.<br />
Anyway, I went to Waterloo for computer science. At the time, it was part of the Mathematics faculty. Which meant that you had to take an inordinate number of math classes just to take one lousy computer science class. And let me tell you &#8212; anyone who complained about their math courses at university didn&#8217;t attend Waterloo. Remember &#8212; it was the Math faculty. They didn&#8217;t teach calculus &#8212; they taught you how calculus worked. I got 12% on my first midterm.<br />
Ouch.<br />
That should have been my first indication that perhaps I might not be long for the Mathematics faculty. Despite getting into the computer science stream in second year, and doing reasonably well in my classes, it was clear by the end of my second year at Waterloo that either I switched to a different line of study, or my arse would be sporting skid marks before too long.<br />
English Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Yep, I&#8217;m officially an Artsie. I took all sorts of wacky courses at Waterloo: psychology, philosophy, physics, calculus, algebra, statistics, literature (several versions), music appreciation, Latin, Spanish &#8230; most of them aimed directly at my new-found major, but I still took the time to take computer science. Management information sciences (which was a total waste of time &#8212; I could have learned that course by reading a text book), development methodology, and networking theory (I learned how the internet actually works). But very little programming.<br />
In fact the most programming I did after going into English was learning how to write HTML &#8212; something I got from my English Rhetoric 209 professor, Neil Randall. He scribbled a few tags on the board and gave us the option of either turning our essays in traditional paper, or online. (Little did I know where that would ultimately take me&#8230;) But none of my university career taught me what I know now &#8212; certainly not to the depth that I seem to have acquired.<br />
Out of university, I was a technical writer, taking the love of writing and my technical know-how and actually making a viable career out of them. But I bored of it. A lot. Soon, I couldn&#8217;t stand technical writing. It was dull, repetitive. Mind-numbing, even. When I worked for Radical Entertainment, I took it upon myself to build some web-based productivity tools (such as a room booking tool) to avoid going insane.<br />
When I started here at Critical Mass, I was hardly a web development expert. I was green. But back then, I was a butt in a seat, earning the company money. It didn&#8217;t matter how much or how little I knew. It was that I could do <em>something</em>. I&#8217;d never heard of an application server, never worked with a content management system, had a clue about any formalized process whatsoever, could barely code enough Javascript to do anything useful, and CSS was the most minimal skill for me. (Were I to apply to Critical Mass today with the skills I had when I was originally hired, I wouldn&#8217;t make it through the resume review round, let alone get an interview.)<br />
Green as bamboo, and just as inflexible. Sure, I could bend, but there was no way I could hold my own to the people who&#8217;d been working there longer than I and understood the industry a lot better. I had to give into requests &#8212; no matter how outrageous &#8212; and accept direction from others.<br />
That&#8217;s what I think about &#8212; that kind of helpless ignorance &#8212; when I stop and wonder how on Earth I managed to say something I didn&#8217;t previously know. And to some degree, still wonder if I actually know it. I don&#8217;t know if any of you have been in this situation, but when I get to talking about things that a mere six years ago I wouldn&#8217;t have given a second thought to (even if I knew enough to do so), I feel like I&#8217;m in some kind of verbal auto-pilot. It just comes out on its own.<br />
It&#8217;s truly strange. I&#8217;ll actually be thinking to myself, as my mouth is motoring along, how is it that I can be saying these things? I&#8217;m not even actually <em>thinking</em> about what I&#8217;m saying! It&#8217;s just coming out, as if someone else were in control of my mouth. It&#8217;s like some freaky version of <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, except I have no idea who&#8217;s in my head or if they get dumped out on the Jersey Turnpike. More likely the intersection of Barlow and 56th near the truck stop, I think.<br />
I always seem to know what to say. So far, I have yet to put my foot in my mouth. I haven&#8217;t said anything truly stupid. But I&#8217;m sure that day is coming. That&#8217;s what I fear most. That I&#8217;ll be in the middle of a good oration on the best way to handle organic search implementation with one of our clients when something comes out that I didn&#8217;t expect. It&#8217;ll sound something like this:<br />
&#8220;The goal is to make sure that the document structure properly contextualizes the content, and is seeded with the keywords from the analysis phase. Rumper gilford flamma-lamma-ding-dong walla walla *snort* willy come home and BANG!&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s going to happen. I know it. The facade will come crashing down and I will be exposed for the phony that I sometimes believe myself to be. I still think of myself as that naive web developer, hired to slap together promotional web properties. I didn&#8217;t care about the standards, how to manage people, the intricacies of client communication, or internal politics. I was a grunt. I still feel like I am, and that somehow I&#8217;ve gotten where I am without truly knowing what on Earth I&#8217;m doing.<br />
The reality is that I <em>do</em> actually know. I just don&#8217;t know that I know. Over the years, I&#8217;ve written a series of handy managerial routines that kick in when needed. It&#8217;s an automatic process, digging out lots of stored bits of knowledge and experience. I suppose this is what it&#8217;s like to have experience &#8212; and dare I say it, wisdom. You just know it. Temet Nosce. The whole Neo-save-the-world thing. You don&#8217;t have to think about it. It&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s ready and waiting to come out. You only need tap the resource, like uncovering an underground stream &#8212; it just flows out.<br />
Still, it&#8217;s weird. I wonder how long it&#8217;ll be until I get used to this?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>James on Monday. Rudy on Friday. I can&#8217;t make any &#8220;Rudy Tuesday&#8221; jokes on this one, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
Rudy was only the second Web Developer that we hired after moving into our current building (I can&#8217;t say &#8220;new&#8221; building, &#8216;cuz it ain&#8217;t new anymore). And that was almost a year after we picked up Carl.<br />
Rudy was one of our workhorses. Give him a task, and let him loose. Didn&#8217;t matter how much time he needed to put into it, didn&#8217;t matter what the estimate was. He got it done, and it was done when it was promised. A quality that is not only admirable, but hard to come across. And it no doubt hurt Rudy&#8217;s social life, at least to some degree.<br />
I never once heard Rudy complain over the years. Admittedly, I&#8217;m not sure complaining is even in Rudy&#8217;s nature. A couple of years ago, Rudy was in a fairly nasty motorbike accident, basically screwing up his legs for a month or two. But even when he struggled in for Jude&#8217;s farewell (see [[So long, Jude!]]) on crutches, he was still all smiles and laughs. I suppose that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to miss most about Rudy.<br />
Rudy was one of the popular crowd, something I never was. Never been a popular person in general, really. I&#8217;m Joe Average. I have my ups and down, but when it comes to the end of the day, I don&#8217;t stand out, make waves, attract, or repel. In a group of two, I&#8217;m the one you won&#8217;t see. I wasn&#8217;t part of the 5% &#8212; even if I was included in a couple of events &#8212; and generally only find out about things after they happen.<br />
That sort of thing really used to bother me a lot, being left out. I was never sure of it was a conscious thing: &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t call Geoff &#8212; we don&#8217;t want him around here!&#8221;. Or was it just merely that I&#8217;m forgotten? Hard to say which is worse &#8212; exclusion or insignificance. They both pretty nasty. It&#8217;s also hard on the ego, being left out like that. It really makes you think about the friends that you have (or don&#8217;t have), and how people ultimately view you.<br />
I&#8217;ve come to accept that I&#8217;m generally not liked. (Hopefully, it doesn&#8217;t extend to me being outright hated.) At best, I&#8217;m tolerated. I can&#8217;t trace the thousand steps it took me to get where I am. It&#8217;s those thousand steps &#8212; or thousand cuts? &#8212; that slowly wore away at any appeal that I did have (and probably some of the credibility, too). I might get the job done, but generally I&#8217;m just a bastard. An ass. Maybe it&#8217;s my own self-importance speaking to me, I&#8217;m not sure. But I know that people treat me differently now than they used to even a couple of years ago. And I feel alone.<br />
With Rudy&#8217;s departure, isolation sinks in more and more.<br />
Rudy was supposed to be my major project this year. Despite being at Critical Mass about three and a half years, he never made it to Senior. I felt he was ready, just that we needed to push him a little more. It was all minor stuff, too. And that the opportunity we had planned for him on the Michelin projects didn&#8217;t come through the way we&#8217;d planned. In many ways, I feel like I failed him.<br />
There&#8217;s almost none of the old guard left. After Dennis, it&#8217;s about a year and a half before you get to Torin, the next most senior web developer we have. I talk to those who&#8217;ve gone to &#8220;greener pastures&#8221;, and I wonder what it would be like out there. In a little over two weeks, I complete my sixth year here at Critical Mass. I&#8217;ve come a long way &#8230; but at what cost? Maybe I&#8217;ve become too complacent? Have I been responsible for too many people leaving? Am I even competant in my job anymore?<br />
I ask myself questions like this more and more. I do what I think is right, but is it? Maybe Rudy&#8217;s got the right idea &#8212; get out while you can and do something else. Work someplace different. Reground yourself before it&#8217;s too late. And maybe I am where I&#8217;m supposed to be. Maybe I&#8217;m already in the only place I can be. Oh, the questions&#8230;<br />
Good luck, Rudy. We&#8217;re gonna miss you &#8217;round the farm. Wherever you land, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Google is the power in the internet right now. Issues with <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/soapbox/google-censorship-china.shtml">censorship</a> aside (and their suddenly lacklustre results in the stock market &#8212; the revaluation is long overdue), Google still remains the top search engine and one of the best ways to engage in online marketing.<br />
Which is the primary reason why when Google comes to town, you make an effort to drop by.<br />
The CCAT &#8212; the <a href="http://www.ccat.org/">Calgary Council for Advanced Technology</a> &#8212; conducts regular meetings. What exactly this group does, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. But they do seem to arrange for an interesting networking opportunity.<br />
Originally, I wasn&#8217;t really interested. Jim sort of goaded me into it, though. Aside from the fact that it was Google, it seemed like getting an entire table of us (eight, in total) would be possible &#8230; but only if I went. I figured, if nothing else, a change to see what else Google had up their sleeves might be something worth seeing.<br />
The night started off at the Telus Convention Centre (lower level of the Glenbow Museum, to be specific), in what I can only describe as the largest networking scene I&#8217;ve yet seen in Calgary. I was hardly a shining example, focusing mostly with Rob (a former co-worker), Mark (from the Green Party of Canada), and a guy who specialized in PDA solutions. Hugh (whose name was recorded as &#8220;High&#8221;) scored about at least a dozen cards in the time we were there. There&#8217;s a man I need to learn a lot more from when it comes to meeting new people!<br />
Table 20 was just us: Dave, Ryan, Allard, Nichole, Chantelle, Jim, Hugh, and myself. Ryan and I ended up with our backs to the stage, where Wendy Muller of Google would speak later on. Until then it was a variety of speakers from around the Calgary community. The only good one (I think) was the CEO of West Canadian, George Brookman. He had a calm, easy demeanour (and apparently knew most of the people in the room &#8212; including the mayor) and leapt into a speech that sounded completely off-the-cuff, and yet completely practiced.<br />
Sadly, he would remain the best speaker of the night. The president of the CCAT read his script, and didn&#8217;t sound at all at ease in front of the room. Normally, the uneasiness should pass in a couple of minutes (or so I&#8217;ve read). Normally.<br />
The keynote was Wendy Muller, the VP of Marketing for Google Canada. She&#8217;s been in the marketing industry for a couple of decades and seems to know her stuff. A couple of things were clear, however, during the course of her speech. First, as much as others look to Wendy to be the &#8220;voice&#8221; of Google Canada, Wendy doesn&#8217;t understand her field.<br />
She&#8217;s been at Google for four years. But she doesn&#8217;t get the point. She doesn&#8217;t get the technology. She&#8217;s an old-school marketer. She knows the way things used to be done. The new way still seems to escape her, however. The presentation was short, and the Q&amp;A period even shorter. Questions were often specific, but Wendy either hasn&#8217;t learned how to divert the answer (the two most common responses were &#8220;no comment&#8221; owing to specific internal situations; or a very long-winded answer, signifying nothing, ending with &#8220;does that answer your question?&#8221;).<br />
And like the president who introduced her, she read her presentation, too. I&#8217;m no speaking guru, but even I know that you should practice your presentation. Make it sound good. Go over it again and again and again until you know it so well that you don&#8217;t need your notes. You should only glance at the presentation to make sure you&#8217;re covering all the points that are there. If you&#8217;re reading the points in their entirety rather than using them as a summary &#8230; might as well email the bugger to everyone on the list and save them the hour.<br />
Well, the meal was pretty good. So perhaps it was ultimately worth it. Even if I didn&#8217;t win the iPod up for grabs.<br />
I think Wendy needs to attend one of the major Search Engine Strategy conferences, and get to see how others present from her company. There&#8217;s a wad of Googlers who are lower-rung than her, and present a lot better. Wendy didn&#8217;t really say anything that I didn&#8217;t already know to some extent (clarification on statistics notwithstanding). And I doubt that I&#8217;m the only one thinking that.</p>

I hate it when friends leave, even if it&#8217;s just to go to another company in the city. And with James&#8217; departure, it hits a little more. Not just because I saw a lot of my older self in him, not just because he was one of our Sr. developers, or even just because he single-handedly put an end to reply-alls in the building for a long time.<br />
It&#8217;s probably because this place will be a lot quieter without him.<br />
I still remember when James started. He was a young, brash, loud, and potentially brilliant developer. Which meant that certain people on the team immediately hated him. Why? Because James rocked the boat by refusing to fall in line. Unlike those of us who chose to go against doctrine in a more passive manner, James was much more vocal. Where others use subtlety, James used subterfuge. When others whispered, James cracked a whip.<br />
Very early on, James single-handedly took on the issue of people replying to companywide emails with trivial points, often engaging everyone in a conversation that no-one truly cared about. James&#8217; approach? The most effective weapon in his arsenal: comedic, sometimes outright mocking images. They did an exceedingly good job at putting replies to an end. James&#8217; first image was beautifully simple: a small boy, praying at the side of a bed (presumably before he went to sleep). The caption read: &#8220;Please God, make it stop.&#8221;<br />
James&#8217; second reply was to a CEO&#8217;s email. I suggested that he might want to back off until he at least passed his probationary period.<br />
I saw a lot of myself in James, only amplified a few times. The brashness of youth, the self-realization of brillance, the demands of excellence. James has yet to reach the age I was when I started (though he is close now), and I wonder if he will mellow over the years in the way I have calmed down. (Those of you who knew me as a teenager/early 20-something will no doubt find that hard to believe.)<br />
I had hoped we could hang onto James, but after three-ish years it&#8217;s hard to hang onto veterans. That&#8217;s the nature of our industry &#8212; a couple years here, a couple years there, and the process goes on. The loss of experience and knowledge is often hard to deal with. It hurts every time we lose a long-term employee. We&#8217;ve seen this loss many times over, and we&#8217;ll see it again and again &#8212; the nature of our business.<br />
Amy. Luke. Adam. Mark. Dave. Jaime. Christine. Andrew. Jude. Scott. Angie. Pat. Carl. Rich. Vlad. Neil. Tamara. Bill. Myles. Damon. Ed. Cory. Jules. Reid. Darren. Nancy. Rob. Jen. Graham. Dave (a different one). And that&#8217;sonly just those I can easily remember. I missed recording most of the departures over the last year due to my blogging inactivity. (There&#8217;s a thousand reasons for that, none of which have any real validity when it comes down to the fact that I just didn&#8217;t do what I should have been doing.) So for all of you who have left who wonder where your farewell is &#8230; I can only apologize.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not blaming anyone for this. Ours is a hard industry, and it&#8217;s hard to stay here for long without the desire to move on. That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that the pressures of the job don&#8217;t get to you first. Client demands are often a hard thing, and they can wear you down. Even in the lower echelons, where client contact rarely happens, the trickle-down effect can be quite pronounced.<br />
I suppose after a while you become immune to the pressure. Or you find a way of dealing with it. Or you go insane. Heck, there&#8217;s really only four options, and if you don&#8217;t decide to move on, you succumb to each of the other three over time &#8230; though the order in which each of them gets you is different from person to person. I think I&#8217;ve almost reached the &#8220;immune&#8221; stage. Or at least, I hope I&#8217;ve almost reached it.<br />
So James is gone. Unlike Scott or Jude, though, he&#8217;s still in town. So it&#8217;s not so bad. And Mike has returned after his effective exile of about four years ago. Rudy&#8217;s going soon, so that&#8217;s something else to contend with.<br />
Times they are a changin&#8217;. For better or for worse, that&#8217;s how life goes. It sucks when friends aren&#8217;t as readily accessible as they were before, but at least &#8212; if nothing else &#8212; the internet does make communication significantly easier.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You could almost have called last night&#8217;s telecast &#8220;The George Clooney Show&#8221;. That man attracts far too much attention for being only one person in Hollywood.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that he doesn&#8217;t deserve attention, but come on&#8230;<br />
I have to admit, I wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled to hear that Jon Stewart was going to host the Oscars. This is an event where the right person can do a spectacular job. Witness the years Billy Crystal and Steve Martin have hosted. The wrong person turns it into a complete fiasco, and you really wonder where the hell it&#8217;s all going. Witness David Letterman.<br />
Despite missing most of the red carpet show (thankfully, no real fashion accidents this year &#8212; though I do have to say that&#8217;s most of the reason I watch that segment, anyway), I sat down with my ear-to-ear grin to watch the show. It started a little differently than previous years. In lieu of reviewing the movies that had come out and were nominated (as Crystal is oft to do in song), it was a recap of the hosts over the last ten or so years, all explaining why they couldn&#8217;t host. The nearest any of them really got to any one movie were the first two: Billy Crystal and Chris Rock, in a tent in a lush valley in the mountains. Both were &#8220;busy&#8221;.<br />
Ironically enough, the funniest one was David Letterman, who claimed he couldn&#8217;t do it as he was watching over Steve Martin&#8217;s kids, so they wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;grow up funny&#8221;. (Steve had delivered the joke a couple of people earlier. The kids &#8212; and a dog &#8212; wore wigs reminiscent of Steve&#8217;s own white locks.)<br />
Jon Stewart woke up from a dream, believing that he was asked to host the Oscars. Only to find himself in bed with Halle Berry. Another dream. When he reawoke, it was George Clooney. Not a dream. Sorta. Clooney didn&#8217;t really seem to be enjoying himself on that one, admittedly. But it wouldn&#8217;t be the last time that evening.<br />
Most of the segments in the show were obviously due to Jon Stewart&#8217;s Emmy award-winning writing team. (The faux mudslinging ads for best actress and best sound mixing, modelled after the well-understood and well-used paradigm of political ads during election campaigns.)<br />
There were a couple of slip-ups during the presentations. Morgan Freeman flubbed a line. Lauren Bacall, out to introduce the timeless film noire segment, had extreme difficulty with her lines &#8212; almost to the point where I thought she was going to give up and leave the stage. But she&#8217;s a quintessential performer, and got herself back on track to a complete finish. (My guess? The teleprompter ran too quickly.)<br />
Yes, the Academy Awards are completely insular. They&#8217;re a reflection of Hollywood&#8217;s self-congratulatory nature, and really have no bearing on any dose of reality outside of the Los Angeles area. So what? It&#8217;s a chance to escape into something completely unnecessary, and watch famous people get jealous on each other.<br />
It&#8217;s also a chance to watch some interesting turns of event. While there was no surprise that &#8220;Wallace and Grommit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#8221; won for Best Animated Feature, nor that &#8220;March of the Penguins&#8221; walked away with Best Full-Length Documentary, there were a few surprises. I hadn&#8217;t expected Reese Witherspoon to snap up Best Actress. Judi Dench, certainly, but not Reese. I&#8217;m not suggesting that she&#8217;s not worthy of the nod, but I wonder what exceedingly minor role Dame Judi will win Best Supporting Actress for next year. Ang Lee wasn&#8217;t a surprise per se, but the competition was stiff. Philip Seymour Hoffman for Best Actor? Not completely surprising &#8212; he&#8217;s an outstanding actor &#8212; but my money was on Brokeback&#8217;s Heath Ledger.<br />
Which does bring up an interesting point: &#8220;Brokeback Mountain&#8221; didn&#8217;t do nearly as well as the buzz suggested. Sure, the buzz is non-binding, but when you consider that the buzz had got to come from <em>somewhere</em>, there much be an iota of truth in it, right? I&#8217;m sure the theme to Brokeback will haunt me for years to come, much as the theme from &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; still does.<br />
The broadcast kept to schedule, and finished on time &#8212; even a little early (by a couple of minutes, anyway). It wasn&#8217;t the best Oscar show I&#8217;ve ever seen, but it was far from the worst. And Jon Stewart? I think he could successfully host again. Once he got into his groove, he was an able host. Not as much an insider as Billy Crystal, and certainly not a lyrical, but at least he doesn&#8217;t try &#8220;Uma, Oprah&#8221; jokes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are a many things that I am grateful for: a loving family, a good job (even if it does stress me out a lot and keeps me insanely busy), good health, high speed internet connections, snow, sunshine, a warm bed, a hot shower, food on my plate, my friends (though I seem to have fewer these days &#8212; my own fault), and my sanity (what little of it that seems to remain, anyway).<br />
Now I have one more thing to add: fuzz therapy.<br />
Not quite a month ago, Asia entered the family. Not the continent &#8230; the cat. Asia is now the fourth cat I&#8217;ve had in my life. And I hope that she&#8217;s here for a long time to come.<br />
My first cat was Sylvester, a black and white domestic short hair (DSH) that I got from my Aunt Ruth. A pregnant stray barn cat wandered into her home (on a farm, of course), and gave birth to a litter of kittens. Smiley, as she became to be known, mothered them for a while before the offspring were given away. I got one of them, and Sylvester Q. Pussycat (as Dad used to call her) was with my family for 18 long years. We had to put her down &#8212; or rather, the task fell to Mom &#8212; when one day, Sylvester seemed unable to keep living, but hadn&#8217;t the strength to die.<br />
Not long afterwards, we inherited my grandmother&#8217;s cat &#8212; a lovely siamese called Spaz. That&#8217;s why I called her, anyway &#8212; I was the only one in my family to use that name. Spaz was originally named &#8220;Yum Yum&#8221;, after a character in the Mikado. Like Sylvester, Spaz was a gift from my Auth Ruth (although Spaz was purebred, not a stray) to keep my grandmother company. Spaz got her name due to her rambunctious nature &#8212; she tended to wreak havoc around my grandmother&#8217;s house. That led to her being declawed in the front, and led to her calming down a bit.<br />
When Grandma had to move out of her house, my family took Spaz in and she became one of the family. And the neighbourhood terror. To other animals, that is. To people she was, well, the cat&#8217;s meow. She loved everyone, and (almost) everyone loved her. But if you were another cat, or a dog, or a raccoon, or a fox, or even a skunk, you were in for some trouble. Spaz took on almost everything. In her years, she lost only twice. One, sadly, to a skunk. (That was really troublesome, considering her affectionate nature.) The second time was to the neighbour&#8217;s Jack Russell terrier, a dog that most of the neighbourhood wanted to see as road pizza. Never put a mark on Spaz, but she didn&#8217;t go outside again for days.<br />
Spaz&#8217;s health would decline in her later years, mostly due to asthma. In the end, I finally [[Putting down my beloved Siamese cat|had to put her down]]. Without question the hardest thing I&#8217;ve ever done in my life. A couple of things have come close since, but nothing else has quite had the same impact.<br />
Cat #3 is Miao Yin, another domestic short hair. Miao Yin was another stray, picked up by my roommate Chris &#8212; a man allergic to cats. I might never fully understand Chris&#8217; reasoning for getting a cat, but I certainly didn&#8217;t mind. Even if Miao Yin had a tendency to not always use the litter box or meow incessantly when she wanted to be fed. Sadly, it wasn&#8217;t the most melodic meow, either. But without question one of the most even-tempered animals I&#8217;ve ever known &#8212; never bit or scratched anyone. And she was a great lap warmer.<br />
Miao Yin is still alive and kicking, despite a minor bout of diabetes, which she seems to have overcome. Miao Yin is now with Tamara, a successive roommate of mine. A change in my life required that I give Miao Yin away &#8212; allergies are a hard thing to overcome, and I didn&#8217;t want to cause too many problems. Luckily, Tamara had bonded quite well with Miao Yin, so she has done very well in her new home. I haven&#8217;t seen her in almost a year now, but I imagine she&#8217;s quite happy.<br />
I had resigned myself to never having a cat again. Which is hard, because I love cats. They&#8217;re the perfect pets, in my view. Sure, some people believe their aloof and self-centred. (Obviously, they&#8217;ve never hung around with humans.) But I find them absolutely warm and personable. You just need to spend the time to get to know them, and for them to get to know you.<br />
Take Asia, the newest addition. She&#8217;s also an ex-stray. She&#8217;s a tabby, or at least tabby-like colouring (with white feet, chin, and belly), about a year and a half old. A little under a month ago, she was just another anonymous cat in the SPCA&#8217;s system. Temporarily taking up residence in the Pet Cetera in southeast Calgary, she didn&#8217;t initially know what to make of this strange person with a beige corduroy jacket and black leather gloves. She was resistent, cautious, but at the same time strangely playful and very interesting.<br />
&#8220;Allergies be damned&#8221;, I heard &#8212; the cat had to come home. And so she did, the next night. She immediately hid behind the furnace. An hour later, she was on the main floor of the house, trying to get an idea of where on Earth she&#8217;d managed to end up. And who were these two strangers?<br />
Petting her was inviting a bite and scratch. Asia had no idea what we were doing, and I suspect that whomever had owned Asia before us had mistreated her quite badly. Even a month later, approaching hands cause her to rear back a bit. A quick sniff seems to quell the issue and she&#8217;ll usually open up to a good chin or belly scratch. However, she still has her claws, and they&#8217;ve since grown back in (they had been heavily worn down, according to the SPCA&#8217;s records). They&#8217;re sharp, too. Little cuts abound in places, but Asia&#8217;s slowly learning that claws aren&#8217;t acceptable.<br />
Especially on the furniture.<br />
Allergies are still an issue however. The day after Asia arrived at home, colds struck. How&#8217;s that for pathetic irony, eh? It was almost impossible to tell what was cold and what was allergy. Asia didn&#8217;t seem to mind or care &#8212; she was still getting attention, food, and a warm place to stretch out. The colds subsided and left, a new filter inserted into the furnace, and an ionic cleaner in the bedroom seemed to improve matters as well. An old bedspring also helped keep Asia out of the bedroom &#8230; at least until she learned how to jump on top of it. For now, a large crumpled sheet of aluminum foil seems to keep her at bay. (And before you ask, no, there is no door to the bedroom. Open concept is neat until you need to keep a cat under control.)<br />
So now I have some fuzz therapy to help me out. When I&#8217;m feeling stressed out or blue, I go find Asia. Unless she&#8217;s having her daily freak out (I still do not understand why cats do that), she never seems to mind a good stroke or two. And her purr goes a long way to clearing the cloud of doubt.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The definition of &#8220;patent&#8221;, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#patent">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. U.S. patent grants are effective only within the United States, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions. Under certain circumstances, patent term extensions or adjustments may be available.<br />
The right conferred by the patent grant is, in the language of the statute and of the grant itself, &#8220;the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling&#8221; the invention in the United States or &#8220;importing&#8221; the invention into the United States. What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import, but the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the invention. Once a patent is issued, the patentee must enforce the patent without aid of the USPTO.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s quite a bit more to that definition, but this is as good a place as any to start. Mostly because this is the key point at which the problems seem to start: &#8220;the right to exclude others from [doing anything with] the invention&#8221;. Basically, suing people to ensure that you either get royalties or stop them from doing anything with the invention in question.<br />
And more importantly it is the term &#8220;invention&#8221; that I have issue with.<br />
Lately, it seems that there are a number of companies quite content with registering patents for &#8220;inventions&#8221; that are little more than an extension of logical progression &#8212; something that was bound to come in just a matter of time. But due to the way that American Capitalism works, there is money to be made &#8230; even if you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to get it.<br />
A few people were applauding the USPTO&#8217;s decision to grant a patent on the techniques used to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180206472">implement rich media interfaces on the internet</a> (and pretty much anything that would connect to the internet, including set-top boxes, wireless devices, and the odd refrigerator). This was filed by Balthaser Online, a one-man operation who happened to think of the idea (filing the application for the patent, that is) before anyone else.<br />
Sound familiar? It should &#8212; a similar sort of broad-ranging patent was filed by Eolas Inc. to handle the method in which plug-ins were included in webpages. That&#8217;s a little thorn in the side of the internet that&#8217;s raged for years, now, with pipsqueak Eolas taking on Microsoft Corporation for over US$520 million in compensation.<br />
Compensation for what? For having an idea? Having <em>just</em> an idea? Where the hell is the value in that? Can anyone tell me why on Earth someone should be awarded over half a billion dollars for an idea? Especially if you didn&#8217;t sell it to someone first?<br />
Both Eolas and Balthaser have something in common: they beat someone else to the punch. They filed patents for things that others were thinking of (or would think of shortly thereafter) &#8212; things that others would expand upon and turn into industry standards and solid techniques. In the case of Eolas, the basic idea of including a plug-in was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium and became the de facto way to include items other than HTML into a given webpage. For Balthaser, they&#8217;ve successfully patented a method for using rich media to present an interface. This includes the use of Flash, Flash, AJAX, and XAML. This affects pretty much every aspect of the much lauded Web 2.0.<br />
But where is the <em>innovation</em>? Sure, they beat everyone else to the punch, but what did those companies do to push their &#8220;inventions&#8221; further? From what we can see, all they did was sit around and wait for the USPTO to approve their patents so they could then turn around and license their patent to those who wanted to use the same ideas, or sue those who refused to cough up the dough.<br />
I side with the companies trying to defend themselves against such ridiculousness &#8212; yes, even Microsoft. I want them to win their little spat against Eolas. Tell me that this makes any sense at all. Did Eolas strike out at every browser maker who has ever used a plug-in? They could have gone after Apple and AOL (owners of Safari and Netscape, respectively). Nope. Just Microsoft. Why? Money, what other possible reason could their be? This is the kind of insipidness that comes as a result of allowing patents on broad concepts that are in development in an industry in several places, or already formed and one person happens to patent it first.<br />
Patents weren&#8217;t intended for &#8220;armchair inventors&#8221; &#8212; they were meant for people who wanted to actually do something with it. Look at the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>, the man credited with inventing (and patenting!) vulcanized rubber. This is a guy who wanted to make a difference, someone who had a vision and was willing to follow that vision to the bitter end. And it was a very hard trail &#8212; he and his family lived in poverty (Goodyear himself was in and out of debtor&#8217;s prison) for most of their lives because of Goodyear&#8217;s obsession with creating vulcanized rubber and trying to market his invention. The poor living conditions led to the death of his son.<br />
Goodyear defended himself in court against a wealthy (and unscrupulous) businessman, Horace Day, who had purchased several of Goodyear&#8217;s first run with the invention &#8212; shoes &#8212; to figure out how it was made so he could duplicate the process. The case, known both as &#8220;Goodyear vs. Day&#8221; and the &#8220;India Rubber Case&#8221; is well-known in patent legal precendent for defending an inventor&#8217;s rights to profit from their hard work.<br />
That&#8217;s the key point of patents &#8212; they&#8217;re a defensive measure, not meant to be a weapon against others. That&#8217;s what most of these new patents seem to be &#8212; an effort to scoop cash because someone had the wherewithal to patent a technique that was already well on the way to development, and not even something they were responsible for coming up with.<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the most recent (potential) offender, Balthaser Online. I loathe to immediately label them as the bad guy, but with the awarded patent, it&#8217;s not looking good. Why? Because Neil Balthaser, the former VP of Strategy for Macromedia, filed a patent in 2001 for &#8220;Methods, Systems and Processes for the Design and Creation of Rich-Media Applications via the Internet&#8221;. This was filed when Flash was already in its third version, so it was hardly a new idea. Balthaser just happened to be the first guy in the door.<br />
But maybe I&#8217;m being too harsh. Maybe I&#8217;ve been too jaded with the silliness of the <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=39838&amp;DisplayTab=Article">Eolas vs. Microsoft lawsuit</a> or the utter nonsense of the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1930636,00.asp">NTP vs. RIM lawsuit</a> (I mean, really guys &#8212; are you so callous about money that you&#8217;re willing to cripple communications for hundreds of thousands of people, bringing chaos to the upper echelons of Corporate America?) that I can&#8217;t see anything but ill intent. It&#8217;s possible that Balthaser got the patent to ensure that no-one else did, and will open that patent to everyone thus ensuring that all the developments in the internet since its filing will continue as they should, without impedence or fear that the financial penalty for innovation won&#8217;t prove efforts were for naught.<br />
Having looked at American Capitalism lately, though, I&#8217;m not willing to hold my breath.<br />
The short of this is that the USPTO does not represent the internet. Developments take place in parallel (and often in concert), building on the steps set down by others often not seen until years later (witness the sudden appearance of AJAX, despite the introduction of the core method &#8212; XMLHttpRequest() &#8212; years earlier by Microsoft). Patents filed by those keen only on reaping the rewards of others&#8217; labour serve only to cause problems and financial hardships for those trying to honestly make a difference (and a few bucks, of course).<br />
The USPTO should be restricted to allowing patents where there is proven effort to invent the concept, and <em>continue that innovation</em> to further the idea, market the idea, and do what the giants of the past did &#8212; such as Goodyear &#8212; and <em>earn the right</em> to own that patent. Not just be the first person to put their hand up.<br />
If the change doesn&#8217;t come, maybe I&#8217;ll file a patent for stupidity, so I can sue all the idiots in the world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass works hard. We know that from all the various nervous ticks we&#8217;ve developed over the years from working too hard.<br />
So you can imagine that when we play, we make up for the difference.<br />
There are two annual events in the Critical Mass calendar. The first is the Summer Event, which has been a staple since I started back in 2000. The other, a more recent edition, is the CMMYs (pronounced &#8220;see-emmies&#8221;). It&#8217;s our own internal awards show, showcasing the work we&#8217;ve done over the last year. It&#8217;s a combination of the Emmys, the Oscars, the MTV Movie Awards, and a car crash. Namely, that it runs longer than you think, but you just can&#8217;t stop watching it.<br />
During CMMY week, Critical Mass is a madhouse. Mostly because we import all of our offices to Calgary and still try to function. The Calgary office surprisingly can still accomodate all those people &#8212; well over 300 of them &#8212; and not have to share desks. Meeting rooms, on the other hand, are in much shorter supply. And that&#8217;s a problem when meetings become a priority because everyone&#8217;s here. And because it&#8217;s a prime time for 2006 planning.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m glad that this week is nearly over &#8212; the meetings have been murder, and I&#8217;ve not gotten nearly enough done. Next week, things will return to normal. I hope.<br />
The events of this week have been varied, but interesting. People started arriving Monday morning from the Toronto office &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t expecting people until Tuesday at the earliest. The Bistro was quite full at breakfast. Faces I&#8217;d not seen in quite some time (partly due to me leaving the Mercedes-Benz account) were a happy sight. And a lot of faces that I&#8217;ve never seen before.<br />
I used to pride myself on knowing everyone in the company. But there are just too many of them now. I think I&#8217;ll be lucky to know even half of Critical Mass. Half of that number I might know personally. It might be a small world, but there are lot of people in it.<br />
Tuesday was the Town Hall and Department meetings. The winter Town Hall is often &#8230; well, dull. Not because it&#8217;s all financial and organizational material. Not <em>just</em> because. It&#8217;s mostly because it&#8217;s not played up as much as the summer Town Hall, which has been the source of some absolute hilarity at the complete expense of anything business-related. So the winter session is a little harder to sit through.<br />
The Department meeting was also a little hard to sit through, despite the lubrication of having beer readily available. The major issue was how the Technology department will work at Critical Mass. We&#8217;ve reorganized a bit, and we&#8217;re now part of the Strategy group. This, I like. I like the idea that Planning will come before Design, and that Technology is a part of that planning. The trouble is, that&#8217;s not the way that Critical Mass has worked in the past &#8212; Technology has historically come after the Design phase.<br />
It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re objected to change, only that we don&#8217;t understand yet how it will all work. But that&#8217;s the thing &#8212; no-one has spelled it out in detail. And no-one will &#8212; you can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s just too many things to state to make it an effective piece of communication. But it&#8217;s the direction that matters, and it&#8217;s something we need to pay closer attention to. Agility and strategic positioning is what it&#8217;s all about.<br />
Wednesday was all about meetings of various kinds. Two of particular importance to me, however, were the Web Development meetings. First was a meeting of the Senior web developers. This is the steering group, the ones who set the best practices in the company, and guide the rest of the team in our daily work. For the last few weeks, we&#8217;ve been establishing our own internal standards. We&#8217;ve had the standards embedded in our culture for a long time, but never actually written down. Now that we have more than one production office, we need to get our act together.<br />
The topic of this meeting? It was important to have this specific meeting, given that all of our seniors were in the same place (except Colin, who got sucked away to a client visit in California). This was the sort of discussion that required everyone present. It&#8217;s a religious debate amongst developers, one that widely divides camps, and creates shouting matches. (Which is also why I bought beer, so we could keep it somewhat calm.)<br />
Tabs vs. spaces.<br />
For those of you in the programming field, you know what I mean. For those of you who have no idea what the big deal is, well, it&#8217;s hard to explain the passion that abounded about which standard we would use. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care. Or I didn&#8217;t until that meeting. As the arguments went along, I fell into line with Dennis&#8217; well-crafted argument to use tabs. Torin&#8217;s defence of spaces never really quite caught on for me, though it was also well-handled. Tabs won out.<br />
The next meeting was not as successful as I would have liked: the Web Dev Bru Ha Ha. Every so often, we try to get the entire Web Dev team out for a drink after work. It&#8217;s a chance to mingle and get to know one another. But despite having the entire team in the city, we got barely half of the team out. Sadly, or fortunately (depending on your view), it just means we&#8217;ll have to keep trying until we get it right.<br />
Thursday, yesterday, was the big day. Everyone was anticipating the big night. And we knew from the start that this was going to be something interesting, when spying the Brokeback Mountain poster taped to one of the meeting room walls &#8230; and then realizing that it said &#8220;Brettback Evan&#8221; and featured the faces of two of our IT wizards, Brett and Evan in place of Heath and Jake.<br />
One final meeting was the BU meeting &#8212; the Business Unit that we belong to. Our BUs are colour-coded, and contain one or more accounts depending on their size. Until a week or so ago, I was part of the Orange BU. That was until we found out that our newest client &#8212; for whom I&#8217;m the Technology Director &#8212; was a lot larger than we&#8217;d thought. Now I&#8217;m in the Gold BU. We&#8217;re still small, but we&#8217;ll be growing this year. But due to our compact size, we could easily squeeze into the upper floor of the Rose and Crown. We were back at the office just before 17:00 to get ready for the CMMYs.<br />
The CMMYs are a time for Critical Mass to play it up a bit. It&#8217;s also a time for us to look more presentable than usual. In fact, there&#8217;s even a dress code: No jeans, no running shoes, no hats. That&#8217;s it, so it leaves a lot of options open &#8212; no matter what your sense of taste is. Last year, it brought out guys in the stereotypically gaudy 1970&#8217;s powder blue tuxedos complete with the ruffled shirts. It&#8217;s a chance for Jerry, our Chairman, to break out his very dapper tuxedo. It&#8217;s a chance for people to dress up in ways they normally wouldn&#8217;t, and enjoy the change.<br />
Deciding that I&#8217;ve worn my wedding suit too often (it&#8217;s becoming a pattern), I opted for something a little different. I wore my kilt.<br />
Actually, it was my dad&#8217;s kilt. Custom-made in Scotland. It&#8217;s a heavy little bugger, but it looks great. The last time I&#8217;d worn it was at Cathy&#8217;s wedding. Back then, I didn&#8217;t like the kilt so much. It&#8217;s a winter-weight kilt, which means you bake in the middle of the summer. I was also a few pounds heavier, meaning I barely fit in it.<br />
I&#8217;m thinner now (thanks to Arthur), so wearing it isn&#8217;t such a burden. And being winter, it&#8217;s more comfortable. Well, almost. It figures that the first actual cold day since winter began in Calgary is the day I&#8217;m going to not wear pants. It was -35 with the wind chill.<br />
We all arrived at the Calgary Hyatt for 18:00 &#8212; the start of cocktail time. When Neil spotted me walking into the coat check area, he spied my hairy legs poking out from under my Morrison dress tartan, and immediately declared: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna know.&#8221;<br />
He was referring, of course, to the oft-mentioned fact: what do Scotsmen wear beneath the kilt? You&#8217;d be surprised how often I was asked that question. But only one person dared check: John. The sheep-shagging haggis stuffer was the only one bold enough to continue hauling it up. I don&#8217;t think he ever got a good look, thankfully! John and I have a long history, though &#8212; he was my account manager on my first project. I met him for the first time when I&#8217;d had to be sent down to Cincinnati to fix a problem on another project (see [[Live from Cincinnati]]).<br />
Dinner was served promptly at 19:00 &#8230; I think. I&#8217;d officially lost track of time by then. I was at the back of the room with my fellow technical cohorts, most of them Flash developers. The rest were web developers. I felt like the old fart at the table, and not just the fact that I&#8217;m older than the rest of them. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass nearly six years &#8212; only Natalia came close to my tenure. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass long enough to be able to remember the events coming up on the projection screen.<br />
(Incidentally, to the Critical Mass historian: the first town hall that took place at the Danish Community Centre followed by a visit to Ceili&#8217;s took place in 2000, not 1999 as it appeared. I know &#8212; I was there. I have witnesses to that effect.)<br />
Dinner was surprisingly good. I was worried that our meals would be &#8230; not terribly satisfying due to the banquet-style serving. But the Hyatt did an outstanding job of my steak. Certainly something worth praising, I think.<br />
Following dinner, we began the awards show. Every year, we strive to have someone worthy of being on stage, someone who can captivate the audience, while simultaneously being able to offer witty, sometimes slanderous quips. Who else but the beautiful Arif?<br />
The awards go for most risky project, ones with the most changes before it was complete, best integration, and so forth. Mixed in between the awards were short clips of video promoting our CMVPs, one of whom would be chosen as CMVP of the year. It&#8217;s a big honour &#8230; and a big cheque. I&#8217;d filmed some stuff for Torin&#8217;s segment. The best part was seeing how the video was edited into it&#8217;s final form. Quotes were intentionally taken out of reference, things spliced in such a way as to tell a story that no one person could tell.<br />
Also thrown in were two other special events. The first was a tribute to Jerry, our new Chairman of the Board. Jerry used to be the CEO, but we had a restructuring this year that put Jerry to the head of the heap. I&#8217;ve gotten to know Jerry a bit over the years, though I know most of my knowledge is courtesy of stories told by others. Though Jerry does tell a number of good ones, himself.<br />
The second was a tribute to employee #001. It was introduced by Darren, who believed himself to be #001. As the story goes, though, he found out that he wasn&#8217;t in fact #001. So he renumbered himself to #000. The one bearing #001 is Randy &#8212; our first financial wizard. Randy doesn&#8217;t say much, but he certainly did this time. And Randy didn&#8217;t allow himself to stay alone, asking up the other original few who are still with Critical Mass. It was time to celebrate one more thing:<br />
iPods.<br />
No, wait, sorry &#8212; that was afterwards. It was to celebrate 10 Years of Critical Mass. Ten years ago, Ted Hellard and Michel Clairo started a little CD-ROM firm. Today, we&#8217;re the top interactive agency in North America. A few people working out of a living room turned into a seven-office marketing demon with over 300 employees. I&#8217;ve been here over half of its life, and I think I&#8217;m going to be here for a long time to come &#8230; I hope.<br />
As a present to everyone who had helped Critical Mass get to where we are, everyone was given a gift: iPods. 30GB versions to the permanent employees, Shuffles to the term employees. I&#8217;ve already got a Nano, so this was icing on the cake. On the back is an inscription: &#8220;CRITICAL MASS Ten years and counting&#8221;.<br />
Brett won for CMVP of the year &#8212; deservedly so. The presentation was accompanied by the trailer for Brettback Evan, a parody of Brokeback Mountain. Every year, every meeting like this, someone creates a classic Critical Mass video. This was the CMMYs&#8217; contribution to posterity. It joins the class of &#8220;Arif Striptease&#8221;, &#8220;Dirty J&#8221;, &#8220;Luke&#8217;s Workout&#8221;, and &#8220;The Office Enforcer&#8221;. One day, I&#8217;ll need to get a DVD of all of these.<br />
We never all made it to Ducky&#8217;s. That had been the plan. But in typical awards fashion, we didn&#8217;t wrap up the show until nearly midnight. By then, it was clear we were better off staying at the Hyatt. I held out until about 2:00 before finally weaving my way home. I&#8217;m not able to handle the drive as well as I used to &#8212; I must be getting old.<br />
This morning was a little rough. My head hurt. Tylenol, an extra-cheesy omelette, a -25 degree walk to the bus stop to get to work (I left my car at the office so I wouldn&#8217;t drive home), and four mugs of jasmine tea corrected the queasiness.<br />
My throat hurts, and my voice is a good octave lower. That&#8217;s mostly due to yelling. As anyone who&#8217;s been around me after two beers and in a noisy environment knows, my ability to control the volume of my voice goes right out the window. I&#8217;m sure I deafened Ryan when I was encouraging him to be passionate about something he wants to do.<br />
Gary showed up at work in the same clothes as last night. He doesn&#8217;t fully remember everything. He wasn&#8217;t even sure if he took pictures (he did) or what happened to his jacket. People are calling in sick. Those here aren&#8217;t moving with the same vigour as usual. Pictures from last night look &#8230; interesting.<br />
God, I love this company.<br />
