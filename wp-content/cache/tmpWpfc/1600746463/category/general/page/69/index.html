	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, 14 February 2006, is being touted as the day people are to <a href="http://actionnetwork.org/sft/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=3738734">&#8220;break-up&#8221; with Google</a> (also <a href="http://noluv4google.com/article.php?id=801">here</a>). They&#8217;re to sever their relationship, their ties, their love for what is still the most dominant search engine on the internet. It might be losing its top place due to a drop in its relevance (word to Google&#8217;s engineers: you guys gotta tighten that baby up &#8212; MSN is beginning to beat you out), but its popularity has never been stronger.<br />
Which is part of the reason why people are trying to punish Google for censoring itself in China. It&#8217;s a backlash against the Big G to try and remind them of their &#8220;do no evil&#8221; mantra.<br />
It&#8217;s about the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard of.<br />
In recorded history, the actions of a group of people have instigated (either directly or as an end result of continued actions) a change in behaviour of an entity, be it the church, a government, or a company. The belief (no matter how ill-thought) is that by removing the traffic from Google&#8217;s engines, people will somehow force Google into removing the censorship in China, allowing the poor, huddled masses there to see all the material currently forbidden by the Chinese government.<br />
The problem isn&#8217;t that Google is censoring &#8212; it&#8217;s that people believe that <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">Google&#8217;s moral direction</a> somehow overrides the legality of operating in another country.<br />
Yes, Google is an American company. It follows all the laws and guidelines set within the United States of America. What most people seem to forget is that just because a company is based there doesn&#8217;t mean that it can behave the same way in every other country on the planet.<br />
The traditional Corporation (we&#8217;ll ignore that the internet exists for a moment) starts in Country A, defined by and operating under the laws that govern that nation. When the Corporation wants to do business in Country B, it can either do so across borders (when it is convenient and relatively painless), or it opens a subsidiary to acclimatize to the different conditions. Every country has a specific set of laws that are almost invariably different (not necessarily hostile towards) to the laws in the originating country. The subsidiary allows the Corporation to function internally with minimal changes, and having the subsidiary deal with the legal specifics.<br />
Even between the United States and Canada, there are legal differences. Although almost economically transparent to one another, there are sufficient differences to require significant treaties to allow the exchange of goods and services (witness the US/Canada Auto Pact or NAFTA). The laws that companies operate within are also different, which leads to having specific subsidiaries in Canada. Even companies like Dell and Microsoft &#8212; and yes, even Google &#8212; have Canadian-specific offices to handle Canadian-specific legal requirements.<br />
When Google wants to do business directly within a country, it needs to open an office. This is particularly important when that country is viewed as being a strong source of revenue. (Yes, folks, this is all due to money. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; or not, money is the root of all evil and money rules everything.) Such is the case with China &#8212; it is the next great revenue source for the search engines. Google just happened to be the first to knock on the door.<br />
China has very specific laws when it comes to information. Such is the reality of living within the confines of a oligarchy-ruled &#8220;communist&#8221; nation. You control the masses (and lest we forget that China has over 1.6 billion people) by controlling information. China allows a great deal of information through its borders (having been there, I&#8217;ve seen what is allowed) and offers its people a great deal of freedom.<br />
But to ensure that its society remains harmonious, there are aspects that are not allowed. Anything to do with democracy, freedom of speech, or anything that might incite revolt against the ruling party is viewed to be particularly dangerous. China has a history of particularly violent civil wars &#8212; even if the ruling party weren&#8217;t trying to save their collective butts, it would be a wise policy to allow gradual change rather than end up with an internal conflict on the order of World War I.<br />
This isn&#8217;t about China&#8217;s policies &#8212; this is about others having to recognize that they exist. Google has, much to the chagrin of others. Google has done what a lot of people now view as a violation of Google&#8217;s moral perogative: censored itself. It has done &#8220;evil&#8221;.<br />
There is an interesting allegory to this. There once was a garden. And in this garden grew a tree. The inhabitants of this garden were told never to eat from the tree. Yet they were inticed by a serpent &#8212; a representation of evil &#8212; to ignore what they were told, and eat the delicious fruit, and ultimately learned the horrible truth.<br />
The story of Adam and Eve is often used as a prime example of evil&#8217;s profits. And yet, if we consider Google to be the tree, for it does contain all the collected knowledge &#8230; who is the snake? It&#8217;s not China, for they want that knowledge to remain in the tree, away from those who would eat the tree&#8217;s fruit. Eating that apple is considered evil.<br />
I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s going to stir a few objections &#8212; how dare I consider the allegory to be even remotely equivalent to a company that chooses to side with an &#8220;evil&#8221; country! Like many things, the concept of &#8220;evil&#8221; is highly subjective. We westerners look down on other nations that do not provide the same notions of freedom. We do not see the same societal constructs that have existed elsewhere for centuries. We consider our enlightenment to be the only true way.<br />
If the recent weeks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy">Muhammad cartoons</a> have not yet taught westerners that absolute belief in our own superiority is a supreme fallacy, I don&#8217;t know what will.<br />
Every company, no matter what medium it exists in or what product or service it offers, must comply with the local laws of the country in which it wishes to do business. For Google to operate in China means it has to contend with the laws that govern China &#8212; that means removing content from their service that are in violation of China&#8217;s information ban. Regardless of how we view China&#8217;s policies, they are what will guide and rule whatever company cares to hang a shingle inside their borders.<br />
Lest we forget, though, it&#8217;s not just China. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1744845,00.asp">Microsoft got slapped by the EU for Windows Media Player.</a> Last time I checked, I didn&#8217;t hear the west complaining about that. In fact, we were encouraging the EU to fine Microsoft and force changes. This was just the EU enforcing the laws they have adopted, for better or for worse.<br />
And it&#8217;s not to say that Google has become wimpy, either. Remember when the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10925344/">White House demanded records on pornography searches</a> on their indexes? Google refused to hand them over. We lauded them for that. But it wasn&#8217;t because they knew they&#8217;d win the hearts of users. It was their policy not to hand over information that was in potential violation of the law. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; includes abiding by the laws they operate under.<br />
Google won&#8217;t be the only one. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/02/12/afx2519826.html">Yahoo&#8217;s following Google to China.</a> And they are also encountering the laws that have given Google so much trouble. The word &#8220;fight&#8221; has shown up, but it&#8217;s not a fight &#8212; it&#8217;s an adaptation. Yahoo, like Google, will need to consider (and probably will end up) censoring its content if it wants to gain the favour needed to earn money behind the Great Wall. And if <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/02/09/china.yahoo.ap/">China asks for information on one of its users</a>, Yahoo will comply.<br />
So perhaps its time for everyone to pull their highly enlightened heads out of the sand and look around. The world doesn&#8217;t end at North America&#8217;s borders. Things are different out there, and companies have to play by different rules if they wish to earn revenue in other nations. And it doesn&#8217;t matter what moral direction that company says it will follow.<br />
The idea here is to pressure China to change its policies by forcing companies to bring in western ideals. This is not a realisitic perspective. Companies will not force changes in an economy the size of China&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not feasible. Companies are too small, too insignficiant. And they know it. Only governments can inflict changes like the ones activists want to see. They want human rights brought in like those in the west. They want Tibet freed. Google can&#8217;t do that. Yahoo can&#8217;t do that.<br />
You want that kind of change? Get your government to change. They&#8217;re the ones who can influence change through trade sanctions, through changes in diplomatic behaviour. Only when political pressure is enacted will it be possible for change to take place. And China&#8217;s considerable economy is tough to overcome.<br />
Don&#8217;t punish Google (or Yahoo, for that matter) for complying with the laws of another country. Talk to your elected official. Lodge your complaints. Make your voice heard by your government. Only through them will the changes you want to see take place.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am a know-it-all. Both in the best and worst senses.<br />
I became one as a kid. When all of my friends were reading Hardy Boys or Lord of the Rings, I was reading through Time Life books, learning how the universe worked &#8212; from the formation of suns right down to the reproductive systems in humans.<br />
That was Mom&#8217;s doing, actually. She knew two things of my behaviour. First, that I read a lot. If we&#8217;d had the Encyclopedia Britannica, I would have read the whole thing, cover to cover. It&#8217;s probably a good thing that we didn&#8217;t, actually. The other thing was that I was nosey. I knew most of Mom&#8217;s good hiding spots for presents. (I&#8217;m sure Mom had a few others that I hadn&#8217;t even considered.) That was how Mom managed to sneak in a book that she was sure I would read.<br />
The human body made up as robots, all geared to explain sexual reproduction to kids. Sounds like a weird concept. The first time that I read the book, it didn&#8217;t sink in. Something just didn&#8217;t make sense. When I reread the book a few months later (Mom had since then removed the book from the &#8220;hiding&#8221; place to the bookshelf), it stuck. It didn&#8217;t fit with my world view at the time, so required some additional processing.<br />
My appetite for information, however, didn&#8217;t waiver. Mom got me another set of books &#8212; Time Life again &#8212; on Planet Earth. This covered pretty much every angle of Earth&#8217;s formation, behaviour, the things that make it up, and the things that live on it. Given that it&#8217;s Time Life, it&#8217;s not super-detailed, but it allowed me to get a decent grasp on plate tectonics.<br />
In Grade Eight.<br />
My English teacher believed that my parents had written the report rather than myself. At the time, I hadn&#8217;t understood the accusation, but would later realize what she was getting at.<br />
Jeopardy bored me. My family had a habit of watching Wheel of Fortune (which I couldn&#8217;t stand, then or now) and Jeopardy over dinner. If I didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the episode, I often came darn close. The Teen and College editions were laughable.<br />
In university, I made it a habit of taking a variety of courses &#8212; for interests&#8217; sake. I went in for Computer Science, came out with an English degree, and took courses from nearly every faculty along the way. Some because I needed courses other than my core ones, but others because they looked interesting. And I learned a lot.<br />
The internet has been my biggest provider, despite the risk of inaccurate (or completely false) information that is sometimes to be found there. The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is my latest obsession, and I regularly find myself consciously steering clear of it so I don&#8217;t become completely absorbed. That, combined with my 70 or so RSS feeds do a pretty decent job of filling my head full of often-useless crap.<br />
And believe me, I keep it pretty full. It got so full that I eventually reached &#8220;informational mass&#8221;, the point at which a person is no longer able to keep this information bottled up and feels the urge to share it with everyone else. Often at annoying or poorly coordinated times. I became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Claven">Cliff Claven</a>.<br />
Yes, my friends have called me that. To my face. In front of my family. Several times.<br />
I can&#8217;t help it! I&#8217;m sure that psychiatry would be well-motivated to investigate this mental illness if they knew how many people are afflicted with know-it-all-ism. Just imagine how many people must require treatment for the sake of their sanity, their marriages, or even their jobs!<br />
My job has been both a blessing and a curse for my know-it-all-ism. It requires me to know a lot to enable decision making, and affords me the chance to offer up information to help others. However, it means that I&#8217;ll frequently offer information that has nothing to do with the work at hand &#8230; such as the specific date the Romanov family was assassinated (16 July 1918) and that Anastasia didn&#8217;t survive as myth sometimes suggests.<br />
One of my ex-project managers, Nancy, even called me on one of my factoids:</p>
<blockquote><p>Geoff, do you actually know that, or do you just make yourself out to sound like you know?</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best part is that you&#8217;ll never know for sure.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the key to being a know-it-all: confidence. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you know something or not. You could be completely wrong about it. But you have to sound like you&#8217;re right, completely and without the possibility of fault. So long as someone is convinced that you know what you&#8217;re talking about (even if you&#8217;re way off), then you&#8217;re a trusted source.<br />
Oh, and you have to speak your mind. Often out-of-turn. When no-one asked for it. That&#8217;s also a defining point of a know-it-all.<br />
Take the case of <a href="http://ajjacobs.com/">A.J. Jacobs</a>, for example. He dedicated himself to the task of reading the Encyclopedia Britannica end-to-end under the guise of becoming the smartest person in the world. And then <a href="http://ajjacobs.com/content/book.asp">he wrote a book about the journey</a>.<br />
I mention this because I&#8217;m reading the book. I&#8217;m only up to P, but so far it&#8217;s been a great book. Especially for me since I really identify with A.J. Or should that be sympathize? Well, I suppose it works both ways. It&#8217;s a great read, though. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s for everyone, mind you, since you need to be a bit of a know-it-all to fully appreciate its humour.<br />
Even A.J., having read the Britannica, admits that you can&#8217;t know everything, and a lot of what you &#8220;know&#8221; depends on how well you can convince others. Take his brother-in-law, Eric, who tried to convince his own wife that a waitress serving them was not from a small town hear where his wife was raised, but in Eastern Europe. Needless to say, A.J. was quite pleased when Eric go trounced. And A.J. learned the secret of being a know-it-all.<br />
I try to manage my dissemination of knowledge, but I know full well that I periodically still sound like Cliff. Without the accent, that is. Or the postal carrier outfit.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate Starbucks.<br />
Not because the word &#8220;Starbucks&#8221; has come to mean anything so popular and prevalent as to find it on every street corner. Not because they&#8217;ve taken the idea of luxury coffee and turned it into a readily-accessible commodity. Not because they charge <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/content/opinion/2004/11/27/the-$5-coffee/">almost five dollars for a coffee</a>.<br />
I hate them because they stopped making Chantico.<br />
What is Chantico? I could use the superlative: &#8220;hot sex in a small cup&#8221;, but even that doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. So I&#8217;ll give you the actual definition: hot whole milk, ground chocolate, a bit of flavour, made really thick. It&#8217;s drinking chocolate. It&#8217;s like heating up a Dairy Milk bar and sucking it back before it resolidifies.<br />
It&#8217;s not for everyone. I know a few people who can&#8217;t stand it. It&#8217;s strong. Really strong. It&#8217;s like a kick to the head compared to regular hot chocolate. (Especially when you ask for a shot of peppermint syrup in it!) But to anyone who loves chocolate, it&#8217;s pure heaven.<br />
And incidentally, I&#8217;m not referring to people who like chocolate who say they love it. You don&#8217;t have an obsession for it. You don&#8217;t start drooling uncontrollably when you see a box of Lindt Lindors. You don&#8217;t go into convulsions when you enter a Bernard Callebaut store. The scent of quality dark chocolate doesn&#8217;t cause blackouts.<br />
I should join Chocolate Lover&#8217;s Anonymous. I know I should. But I can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t want to wean myself off of chocolate. When I see the episode of the Simpson&#8217;s where Homer daydreams that he&#8217;s in the Land of Chocolate &#8212; I <em>identify</em> with that! I think how wonderful a place like that would be! Damn the implications of malnourishment and tooth decay &#8212; it&#8217;s all about the gratification!<br />
That&#8217;s what Chantico is &#8230; or rather, was, for me. It was the little land of chocolate in a small paper container. I weep for the loss, as I know of no replacement for it. My life will likely change now as I embark on a journey to find that replacement. I will search high, low, in, out, up, down, forward, backward, under, over, through, and around every single place I ever happen to be, searching for a recipe, a scrap of knowledge, even a hint of a whisper that I might yet again experience the sheer ecstacy that is drinking chocolate.<br />
So if you do one day come across a poor, broken man on the side of the road who asks you for a chocolate bar, give the poor man pity. It&#8217;s not his fault. The chocolate made me do it.<br />
That is why I hate Starbucks.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Wow. Long time no write, eh?<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how one&#8217;s life can change so dramatically in such a short period of time. Things that had once been hugely important become minor, and things you never imagined having a major sway in life suddenly start dominating every action and thought.<br />
I&#8217;m not going to recap the events of 2005 &#8212; at least not in detail. Suffice to say, a lot has happened. I went around the world. I got promoted. I got married. I moved into a new house. I travelled. I welcomed a new niece. I worked far harder than I had in a long time, and pretty much shrank off into a little world of my own.<br />
That&#8217;s what happens when you don&#8217;t try to balance yourself better. The only result of that is suffering. Not just yourself (or myself, as the case ended up being) but also those around you. It&#8217;s hard, and some of the decisions you make are not always wise ones.<br />
Because of the last year, I backed off of writing a lot. I tried getting back into it with more ranting (like that ever accomplished anything), and then decided I need to take my site in a different direction and started doing a photo blog. That was not quite a disaster, but I just couldn&#8217;t keep up to the schedule I had tried to set myself. The website takes a decided backseat to everything else. It has to.<br />
Ultimately, I became very dissatisfied with the way things were going. I was ruining a lot of things, mostly because I kept stewing over things not going the way I&#8217;d like them to. This website, believe it or not, was one of the key things driving me nuts.<br />
Spammers are a problem. I didn&#8217;t get into the site a lot, but when I did, I spent way too much time cleaning up the mess. As nice as blogging tools are, some things are just not needed. And apparently, those bonehead script kiddies out there haven&#8217;t figured out that comment spam doesn&#8217;t do anything other than piss off the administrator. You can only take so much garbage on Texas Hold&#8217;em poker sites before you finally go off the deep end.<br />
I decided to go back to my roots. Hand-coded. Hand-administered. Old school. But far less prone to problems, even with the extra work needed to do even a simple post as this one.<br />
So I&#8217;m back, and I&#8217;m hoping to stay around a little more frequently. Emphasis on the word &#8220;hope&#8221;.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Canadians are strange. I know &#8212; I&#8217;m one of them.<br />
In some places in the world, such as our oft-maligned (deservably or not) neighbour to the south, people vote for a person and the position/platform that they take in the course of presented themselves to the electorate. The fact that they belong to a specific political party is often inconsequential.<br />
We Canucks are a strange lot, however: We&#8217;ll actually vote out completely competant and capable people, or somehow magically organize ourselves nationwide to vote out a party in retaliation for things they&#8217;ve done during their administration. It&#8217;s our polite way of taking revenge.<br />
Canada took revenge on the Liberals. After a decade of ruling the country, we decided to give them the heave-ho in favour of the only other politically-viable party: the Conservatives. Thankfully, we collectively had the sanity to only give the Conservatives a minority government &#8212; the baby managed to hang onto the tub while we threw out the bathwater.<br />
Do I like the fact that the Conservatives are in? Not particularly. I don&#8217;t much like the right-of-right-wing idealism that has spun out of that group in the last couple of years. I didn&#8217;t mind the Progressive Conservative party back in the day. Periodically inane, yes, and were effectively decimated to two lousy seats following the Mulrooney era, but all-in-all weren&#8217;t that bad.<br />
Canadians have a short memory. People seem to forget that it was because of the Liberals that we have most of the social policies that we do today. Remember, if it weren&#8217;t for Trudeau, the state would have poked its nose into the bedrooms of the nation probably well into the 1970s. Following Mulrooney&#8217;s retirement from office (wisely chosen mere months before a federal election eliminated the PCs of official party status in the House of Commons) &#8230; anyone remember why?<br />
Oh, and anyone ever really notice that the dropped &#8220;Progressive&#8221; from the party name? That should be an indication of how willing the Conservatives are willing to look forward. The Conservatives are intersted in status quo &#8212; the one of years&#8217; past.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m in no way trying to absolve the Liberals of wrongdoing. There were serious violations of protocol, and people knew about it. At least internally. It wasn&#8217;t until the Gomery Inquiry that things came more to light. It was a mess. The ruling party was involved. And darn it, that just ain&#8217;t Canadian!<br />
Let&#8217;s ignore one of the more crucial facts: Not all the Liberals were involved in the scandal. In fact, most of the shenanigans took place with federal employees &#8212; people the electorate have no control over. People who might still be there. Certainly, if nothing else, the poisoned environment still exists. Things might have gotten quieter, but does it mean that the corruption has been purged? I&#8217;m willing to suggest it&#8217;s not.<br />
The part that worries me most of all this is how much we&#8217;re going to be set back. The Conservatives (so aptly named) are scared of anything that go against what they consider normal. They will do everything in their (albeit limited) power to take away rights bestowed to groups, takea way the legislation geared to making Canada safer and open, and abolishing systems we have come to depend on. Oh, and the child care thing? Harper &#8212; please take a lesson from Quebec. They&#8217;re the only ones who have this figured out.<br />
How long the Conservatives stay in the lead role remains to be seen. Minority governments generally don&#8217;t last long because before too long, they either make a mistake and are forced to set a new election, get overly cocky and want to hold an election to get more seats, or the other parties gang up and end up dissolving the house &#8212; and bringing about another election. I speculate they&#8217;ll play it safe as long as possible to stay in power as long as possible. Make enough good in-roads with the rest of Canada, and they might pull of a majority government.<br />
The next few years will be interesting, to say the least. And I sincerely hope it&#8217;s not a disasterous four years.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Minority governments are always a touchy thing. This is something the Americans have trouble with &#8212; in a two-party system, you don&#8217;t get minority governments, just slim margins. In multiple party systems (three or more), it&#8217;s possible to have a situation where the ruling party doesn&#8217;t have a majority of the seats in the legislative house. When that happens, fewer decisions can be effectively made, and the whole political process slows down even more than usual.<br />
And that&#8217;s a pretty darn scary thought, when you get right down to it.<br />
Seventeen months ago, that&#8217;s exactly what happened in Canada. We hadn&#8217;t seen a federal minority government for quite some time, mostly because people remember how successful the last one was. People tended to vote either for the Progressive Conservatives (now just the Conservative Party) or the Liberals. A few people would vote for the NDP (mostly in British Columbia, it would seem), or the Bloc Quebecois; but one of the Tories or the Liberals would usually run the House of Commons.<br />
Seventeen months ago, after a few rounds of Liberal governments, the Canadian population decided to get &#8220;strategic&#8221;. Every time this happens, it means a minority government. Oddly enough, this is what Canadians &#8220;want&#8221;, because it means we get a bit of a break of one party acting like they own the place. That means fewer decisions, and less rocking of the boat.<br />
Now, given, the Liberals were the ones boat-rocking. Normally, they&#8217;re pretty &#8230; well, dull. They do some nice stuff, they do some not-so-nice stuff, but they&#8217;re middle-of-the-road. They&#8217;re centre. They&#8217;re Liberals. But the whole <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/groupaction/sponsorship_inquiries.html">Sponsorship Scandal</a> really threw a wrench in the works, and brought the Liberals out as looking like the bad guys.<br />
Okay, yes, they did try to hide the facts. And the funds were being redirected back into the Liberal coffers. And they tried to deny it. And a couple of Liberal people were involved. Yeah, things aren&#8217;t all that rosey, when you start to look into it.<br />
So the leaders of the three major opposition parties (<a href="http://www.conservative.ca/EN/biography/">Stephen Harper</a>, Conservative Party; <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/bio/">Jack Layton</a>, NDP; and <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/fr/equipe_detail.asp?ID=58">Gilles Duceppe</a>, Bloc Québécois) banded together to take the Liberals out.<br />
Right before Christmas.<br />
Thanks a lot, guys. We really appreciate this. I mean, how much better could the holiday season possibly get now that we have to not only contend with the over-commercialization of a formerly holy Christian holiday (replete with way too many red-tag sales and far too much Kenny G&#8217;s &#8220;Greatest Holiday Classics&#8221;) than to also endure the intolerable jackhammer chatter of &#8220;vote for me or my opponent will ruin this country&#8221;.<br />
Yeah, there&#8217;s a cheery message for the season.<br />
Okay, while we&#8217;re on the topic, let&#8217;s look at a few things&#8230;<br />
The Conservative Party. Led by the unthinkable Stephen Harper. When the mere suggestion of same-sex marriage came up, the first thing he was happy to pronounce was that when he was elected, he would table legislation to have it removed from the law books. Now that he is looking at election square in the face, he&#8217;s actually pulled back a bit. Why? Easy &#8212; he&#8217;s got to look good to southern Ontario, the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, most of Quebec, and a good chunk of the Maritime Provinces who perceive him as a fanatical right-wing racist homophobic nutjob. Given some of the wonderful things that he&#8217;s said over the years (<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/s/stephen_harper.html">the silly and the stupid</a>, and while I hate to have a &#8220;they say, he says&#8221; thing going on, I rather like the Liberal&#8217;s idea for a <a href="http://www.stephenharpersaid.ca/">campaign against Stephen Harper</a>), how can we take this guy seriously? At least King Ralph has the history of being an alcoholic with which to pass of some of the strange things that he&#8217;s uttered.<br />
The Liberals. Been in power a few too many years, some would suggest. They&#8217;re not reliable, they&#8217;re dishonest, bla bla bla. Spotless record? Heck no. Name a political party in <strong>any</strong> country that&#8217;s got a spotless record. About as easy as finding a vegan in Alberta&#8217;s cattle country. Paul Martin&#8217;s regarded as the most credible of the leaders up for the top seat, but he only comes in at 34%. Why not more? Scandals do damage. Mr. Martin might think he did a good job keeps arm&#8217;s distance from the whole thing, but let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; there&#8217;s been some real shady things going on in the Ruling House, and given Paul&#8217;s neck-deep interest (remember that he was Finance Minister for a long time; you don&#8217;t hold a position like that and not know a few things) he can&#8217;t come out squeaky clean.<br />
The NDP. The Shiny, Happy People Party. The Things Are Always Perfect Party Even If We Don&#8217;t Really Understand What We&#8217;re Doing Party. Okay, maybe that last one was a little unfair, but generally speaking, the NDP haven&#8217;t done a particularly good job when they manage to get into power. Witness Saskatchewan, Ontario (for that brief period in the 1990s), and British Columbia. The NDP generally have the right idea, but their implementation stinks. Ironically enough, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Rae">former Ontario premier Bob Rae</a> was one of the best politicians Canada has seen since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> &#8230; but he only figured it out about a year before the NDP were all but laid waste in a provincial election. The Federal NDP are led by Jack Layton, a former Toronto city councillor. He was an able person who did a good job of representing his riding in the now mega-city. But that wasn&#8217;t enough &#8212; he wanted to represent Toronto in Canada.<br />
And that&#8217;s his problem. Just like Harper doesn&#8217;t understand anything outside of the conservative west, Martin doesn&#8217;t understand the west, Duceppe doesn&#8217;t give a crap for anything outside of Quebec (and probably not for Anglo Montreal, either), Layton doesn&#8217;t get anything outside of Toronto. Sure, he&#8217;s <em>been</em> outside of Toronto, but he doesn&#8217;t get it. He&#8217;s been there too long. If Jack&#8217;s to get any credibility, he needs to live in Truro, Campbellton, Churchill, Prince Albert, Yellowknife, and Kamloops for a few months each. Yes, Toronto is the economic hub of Canada, but as I&#8217;ve learned myself, there&#8217;s a lot more to this country than the corner of Yonge and Dundas. Is he a capable politician? Heck yes &#8212; he worked out a deal with the Liberals to push through a budget, with a few conditions of his own. That&#8217;s well-used power. Can he do that if it were only the NDP in power? Don&#8217;t hold your breath&#8230;<br />
And then there&#8217;s the Bloc. Do I really need to review these guys? Gilles Duceppe doesn&#8217;t care about the rest of Canada. All he wants is separation, and he doesn&#8217;t even understand why. It&#8217;s not because of French culture (if he believes that Anglo Canada is trying to wipe it out, he needs to live out in BC for a while, immerse himself in the Anglo society, then move back &#8212; then he&#8217;ll see how distinctive and wonderful it truly is). It&#8217;s not because of French politics (Quebec uses civil law, unlike the rest of Canada &#8212; and big surprise, it works just fine without any interference from anyone else). It&#8217;s not for money (Quebec is largely dependent on transfers from the Federal government, much of which comes from Ontario and Alberta). So what&#8217;s the big chip on your shoulder, Gilles? What do you like about the rest of us? We smell or something? Not like the Bloc could ever actually take over as the ruling party &#8212; because of their limited span, they couldn&#8217;t get enough seats to pull that off. And in all honesty, they&#8217;re about the best opposition party because they hate everything the ruling party does.<br />
The big cry is the sweeping change: Get the Liberals out, get us (&#8220;us&#8221; being one of the opposition parties at hand) in, and things will get better.<br />
But will they? Based purely on track record, the NDP would likely screw up the finances. (People say the Liberals already did, but they were the ones who brought the debt under control and have managed to actually produce surpluses.) There would be more programs, yes, but before long taxes would have to go up. The Tories would no doubt try to live up to their idiotic promise of reducing the GST &#8230; which would no doubt backfire once the coffers run dry due to all the cuts in taxes given to all their friends in business, or so history suggests. Oh, and then there&#8217;s that minor setback in equal rights as they squash all the progress we&#8217;ve made, but who would really notice that, any way? The Liberals would likely do status quo. But after over a decade of the same tune, do you really want to keep listening?<br />
Whoever ends up in power still has one minor problem: All that infrastructure that made the Sponsorship Scandal work? Still there. All the ineffiiencies? Still there. All the duct tape holding parts of our fragile goverment together? Still there. Voting out the ruling party doesn&#8217;t get rid of it. It doesn&#8217;t go away.<br />
So yes, we have ourselves a wonderful Christmas present: We get to think about all the problems we have with our Feds and try to make some sort of an educated decision that might somehow make our lives better.<br />
But we won&#8217;t. Fact is, we have no clear options. All of them have their flaws. All of them fail to see the forest for the trees. All of them fail to see past the political daycare centre that we elected them into, complete with same the squabbling, toy-hogging, paste-eating mentality we see in people one tenth their age.<br />
Better buy yourselves something nice for Christmas, folks. With luck, it&#8217;ll put you in a good enough mood to survive until late January.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Y&#8217;know, I used to believe that all the really shady governmental meddling always happened south of the border.<br />
Little did I know that our own government has been setting the stage to run things that we&#8217;d been taking for granted. I caught this first on SlashDot (news for nerds), which directed me to the appropriate article on the Toronto Star website.<br />
It&#8217;s quite freaky, actually. The short version of the story is that <a href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/">Canadian law enforcement wants near-direct access</a> to any information an Telecommunications Service Provider (TSP) might have regarding their users or the information their users transmit over a TSP&#8217;s systems. Without court orders and without having to inform the users. The TSP has no legal recourse but to cough up the goods or face fines and jail time.<br />
Awfully heavy-handed, if you ask me. This is not the usual behaviour of our spend-millions-on-useless-inquests governments. Someone&#8217;s been taking lessons from Uncle Sam.<br />
There&#8217;s a dual impact: not only are our rights to privacy completely ignored (and didn&#8217;t we just <a href="http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/index_e.asp">finish putting in privacy laws</a>?), but there&#8217;s a huge financial cost to the TSPs. Three guesses where that cost will be transferred to? Hello, $50 residential phone service.<br />
But where is this all coming from? The majority of it is the internet, which relies heavily on the TSPs for carrying the signals around the country. The internet scares many people, and it&#8217;s not just the grandmothers of the world who hear about the &#8220;web&#8221; and think of a room full of spiders. It scares legislators because the internet has long been out of the reach of the law.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say people haven&#8217;t tried. Regulation has had some effect in the United States. If you call <a href="http://news.com.com/RIAA+settles+with+12-year-old+girl/2100-1027_3-5073717.html">suing a 12 year-old kid for sharing music</a> files effective, anyway. Here in the Great Not-Quite-White North (all the snow is gone in Calgary), it&#8217;s been hands off. Or so we thought.<br />
It seems the hands were under the table, trying to tap into the phone lines. The government wants to know what we&#8217;re up to. Telephones, email, FTP transmissions, binary streaming data, even VoIP access. And since the internet also runs across cable providers, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if venerable televisions falls under the harsh gaze of the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">RCMP</a>, or even <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">CSIS</a>.<br />
The world changed, and we didn&#8217;t notice. We just went along for the ride. But the fear that the world is running unchecked is worrying some up on Parliament Hill, and they want control. Perhaps not direct control, as in North Korea, but they want to know when we&#8217;re not behaving.<br />
That&#8217;s all fine &#8212; we put governments in place so we don&#8217;t have to deal with the monotony of Big Picture hassles. That&#8217;s what governments do. Did we give them permission to read our emails? Without a court order, I think not.<br />
The legislation currently going through is wide-ranging, and it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty vague. They&#8217;ll be able to define it however they want, and the only victim is every single Canadian who dares to pick up a phone.<br />
I&#8217;m curious to know the underlying reasons. No doubt that fear is an issue &#8212; fear that the government doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on under the covers. Fear that the <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/">CRTC</a> can&#8217;t control what goes on over the internet. Fear that the telecoms might suffer as a result of VoIP.<br />
Technology changes at orders of magnitude faster than anyone in the government can comprehend. By the time you finish reading this, something else big will be on its way. Governments cannot expect to manage something like this without having the capability of understanding it.<br />
Perhaps that means we need a Ministry of Information. Yes, that rings of <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/combined">Brazil</a>, but that&#8217;s not my view. It&#8217;s a place where people can understand the technical infrastructure of Canada. What&#8217;s going on in those phone lines, and what kind of recommendations can be made to make sure that everyone plays nice, and we don&#8217;t impede upon the rights of others. (Like our privacy, for example.)<br />
The world won&#8217;t ever stop changing. That means we need to change. And so does the Government&#8217;s thinking.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m an avid reader of Yahoo!&#8217;s <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=index&amp;cid=757">Oddly Enough</a> news section. Usually because it&#8217;s full of irreverent blurbs. Every so often, there&#8217;s something that creeps in there that actually ticks me off.<br />
Ever heard of the Bavarian Purity Act of 1516? It&#8217;s also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>. Basically, it makes sure that your finely crafted German beer is as finely crafted as the price you paid.<br />
For almost 500 years, the law has stated that there would be only four ingredients in German beer: malt, hops, yeast, and water. That was partly for political reasons (e.g. bakers getting their wheat) but also to make sure that shifty brewers wouldn&#8217;t take shortcuts.<br />
Well, some bozo felt it was a good idea to challenge the law because he wanted to add sugar to his product. Never mind the half-MILLENNIUM of tradition and quality. Never mind that the Bavarian Purity Act is even used as a marketing gimmick for other beers around the world. No, sorry, we have to put sugar in ours and still call it beer.<br />
Jerks.<br />
So they managed to convince the courts, after a decade, that the Bavarian Purity Act should be weakened. One day, sadly, it will probably have no oomph at all, and will be merely a distant memory.<br />
So raise a glass of [insert favourite German beer here], &#8230; cuz it won&#8217;t be long before it won&#8217;t be just &#8220;beer&#8221; anymore.</p>
