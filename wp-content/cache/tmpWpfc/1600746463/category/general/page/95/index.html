	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A little exercise never killed anyone &#8230; but there&#8217;s always a first time.<br />
This morning, I made my first visit to a gym in about seven years. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, and no, it&#8217;s not some lame New Year&#8217;s resolution that I&#8217;ve finally got around to. I&#8217;ve actually been wanting to do this for over a year and a half, but found every excuse I could to avoid it. Now I have a vested interest in fitness, and made an effort to give myself no option.<br />
On Saturday, I dropped by the YMCA in Eau Claire, forked over the fee, and got myself a membership. I then went out for a new pair of shoes that I knew I was going to need. This morning, I woke at 5:30, grabbed my bag, and headed out to see what new definitions of pain I could discover.<br />
Actually, I wasn&#8217;t quite that negative. I had a fairly ambitious goal: An hour workout without passing out, heaving up, or needing the assistance of emergency medical sevices.<br />
Laugh if you will, but to say my mind and body are at odds when it comes to exercise is like saying Israel and Palestine are bosom buddies.<br />
Body: I need exercise! Get me in shape, Mind!<br />
Mind: I hate exercise. It&#8217;s so monotonous.<br />
Body: Either you get me exercise, or I&#8217;ll start craving things you won&#8217;t like.<br />
Mind: Ha! Go on. I&#8217;m not scared of you. You have no power over me.<br />
Body: One word: Tequila.<br />
Mind: Is 6:00 okay for you?<br />
Of course, once things get underway, there&#8217;s a sight reversal&#8230;<br />
Body: SWEET JESUS! What were you thinking?!<br />
Mind: Hey, don&#8217;t blame this one me! You&#8217;re the one who wanted this, pal!<br />
Body: Yeah, okay, but 10 kilometres of rowing, 20 kilometres of biking *uphill*, and then a 15-minute endurance swim? That&#8217;s just mean!<br />
Mind: Stop being such a baby, it&#8217;s not that bad. It&#8217;s just mind over matter.<br />
Body: But I don&#8217;t have a mind &#8212; that&#8217;s you!<br />
Mind: Not my problem&#8230;<br />
One of them is gonna kill me. It&#8217;s just a matter of time&#8230;<br />
The Eau Claire YMCA is about 15 years old. The shape that it&#8217;s kept in, you&#8217;d swear no more than a third of that. The facilities are huge &#8212; they have to be for the number of people who come through there &#8212; and immaculately kept. The equipment is in great shape (although the footstraps on the rowing machine kept coming loose), the place is spotless, the air temperature about perfect, and the water in the pool is devine (except the near-lethal levels of chlorine).<br />
So yes, I hurt. Not a lot, mind you &#8212; I didn&#8217;t do weights. That&#8217;s tomorrow morning. Mostly, it&#8217;s my head. Muscles are beginning to remember that they hold this 20-odd pound of meat in place, and they&#8217;re not really enjoying the extra workout. My inner thighs hurt, but it&#8217;s not from muscles &#8212; my skin has the approximate texture of a cheese grater thanks to the near-desert climbe, and the aforementioned chlorine.<br />
And then there&#8217;s my hands, or more specifically, the skin just under where the finger attaches to the palm. All the callouses I&#8217;d built up when I was with the CBC have apparently worn off. I noticed this when I was showering afterwards &#8212; that burning sensation on my skin couldn&#8217;t be due to anything but inflammed skin. Sure enough &#8212; blisters. Big ones. I guess you got to start somewhere.<br />
My morning went from one workout at the gym, to another workout at the dentist. This was my regular six-month checkup. I hoped it would go much better than my visit this time last year (see [[Going to the Dentist, Getting my first Cavity]]). For the most part, I was right. First exercise in futility: x-rays. Captain Choke struck again, and x-rays were delayed for another visit. Onto scaling and polishing. Snooze. Then it was inspection.<br />
This is the part I&#8217;m beginning to hate. Everytime I get an inspection, the dentist finds something wrong. I&#8217;m not sure if my mouth is just falling apart, or if previous dentists were morons. Either way, as he was probing my teeth, he muttered something about &#8220;D5, inclusion&#8221;, which in dentese apparently means my tooth has gone &#8220;soft&#8221;. In other words: return visit on Thursday for correction.<br />
I just hope it doesn&#8217;t mean drilling.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The year 4700 on the Chinese calendar got off to a very sombre start.<br />
Today is Chinese New Year&#8217;s day. Today, I had many things I wanted to do. Most of them were summarily forgotten when, barely a few minutes out of bed, Tamara announced: &#8220;The space shuttle blew up.&#8221; I took pause. I was barely awake enough to know that this was bad, but not awake enough for it to truly have effect.<br />
I marched downstairs and turned on CNN. The coverage wasn&#8217;t as intense as September 11th (see [[Reaction to September 11, 2001 (9/11)]]). CNN was skipping commercials, in favour of coverage. They flipped around constantly, talking with reporters from all over America, periodically talking with an official or former engineer. CBC had entirely different coverage, actually bringing in Roberta Bondar to talk with their anchor. A press conference with the Canadian Space Agency featured Marc Garneau.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t the oppressive feeling of loss or shock. Perhaps we&#8217;ve just become too immune. Then an interesting fact came to light &#8212; it was 17 years and four days since the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded over the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds into the 25th shuttle mission.<br />
Just after noon, I was doing my duty as a student crossing guard, curbing the flow of traffic so students could return to school after lunch. As usual, one girl &#8212; a few grades behind me &#8212; came up to deliver her daily torture. For some reason, we didn&#8217;t much like each other. She was a little caustic, and I had a superiority complex. Yet we each recognized this, and turned it into a game. On that day, however, she instead told me the truth: The shuttle had exploded.<br />
At first, I hadn&#8217;t believed her. The shuttle couldn&#8217;t explode. It was the space shuttle! It was NASA! That sort of thing just doesn&#8217;t happen. (This was long before I&#8217;d learned of the Apollo 1 fire, or saw video of NASA&#8217;s early rocket failures.) My faith in the American space programme was unfaltering. I expected there to be regular flights into space by the time I was 20. For the shuttle to explode just seemed too fantastic.<br />
The truth sank in before I returned to school after lunch. Most of my friends didn&#8217;t go home for lunch, and didn&#8217;t know. They seemed as doubtful as I had been. Barely a few minutes into class, the principal called an assembly in the gym. It was true. The shuttle had exploded barely a minute off the launchpad. I don&#8217;t remember the rest of the afternoon. But I watched the entire 6:00pm CityTV news broadcast, which had been almost entirely devoted to the shuttle disaster (only five minutes were granted to other news).<br />
Seventeen years later, the reaction was different. People seemed shocked, yes, but more were accepting of the dangers of spaceflight. It seems that while people do become complacent about regular shuttle launches, they seem to all know that eventually, something will go wrong. When Tamara had told me the shuttle exploded, I assumed it was a launch. Breaking up on reentry was something I had not considered.<br />
I eventually did run a few errands. But in the back of my mind the entire time was what sort of things could I expect to see. Thoughts of what I&#8217;d seen on September 11th still haunt me. I saw and heard nothing. It was almost like it hadn&#8217;t happened. In fact, if Calgary had been upset by the disaster, it was already well on the way to recovery. Chinese New Year went ahead without pause. It was business as usual.<br />
Still, everyone seemed to talk about the loss of Columbia, even if it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on their minds. We still went to Chinese New Year dinner. We still went about our lives. But the thought is still there. I don&#8217;t know if in 17 years, I&#8217;ll remember where I was today.<br />
But I will remember what happened.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Like most people who work the ol&#8217; 9-5 grind, my weekend started just as the whistle blew Friday afternoon. It was time to get my nose off the grindstone and into something far more pleasant. A beer.<br />
Not that I want to sound alcoholic (as if I don&#8217;t already sound like that from previous entries &#8212; see most of the entries from the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC train</a>, [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]], [[My Housewarming Party]], [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]], [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]], [[The Critical Mass Summer Social 2001]], [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]], etc.), but this time I actually had a pretty good excuse. There were a fairly large number of birthdays on my floor of the office (referred to as &#8220;Technology&#8221;, &#8220;The Technical Floor&#8221;, &#8220;Domain of the Extremely Geeky&#8221;, &#8220;Realm of the Magicians&#8221;, and the &#8220;Second Floor&#8221;, depending on who you ask), and a few of us went to celebrate Carl, Nathan (recently returned from Europe), and Jude (who could not join us until later).<br />
It&#8217;s good to get out with other members of the Technology department &#8212; I&#8217;m so isolated working on my account that I rarely ever see them again, except in the two neutral zones on my floor: the washroom and the kitchen. This is our chance to sit around, chat about pretty much anything but work (although it&#8217;s inevitable that we do), and act like idiots &#8230; okay, so it&#8217;s not much different that at the office. But at least we can drink.<br />
Following our beverages, we plummeted ourselves back into the -25 degree evening for the second part of the show. The festivities of the evening were divided into three parts: Vicious Circle (the bar/club where we like to hang out), Sakana Grill (about the only place in town for large groups to go for sushi), and roller skating. I avoided the third part mostly due to a total lack of coordination. That, and I really didn&#8217;t feel like adding that kind of fodder to my journal entries.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t been to Sakana Grill for months with a group (I&#8217;ve been there with Therese and Stuart a couple of times). The last time any large number of us were there was when we said farewell to Chris, Nathan, and Jen as they prepared to leave the company (see [[Preparing to Move to Japan]]). Nathan, Carl, and I were extremely happy to arrive. The temperature outside was bitingly cold, even by my standards. Carl and I opted to warm up with sake. We mistakenly ordered a 1/2 litre of it. Not that I was about to complain&#8230;<br />
We had at least 25 people crammed around two tables. We were loud. Loud enough to attract the new head chef. The last time we&#8217;d been there, Peter had not appeared. Peter was the guy Carl always managed to goad into giving us free rounds of sake. But Peter seems to be gone. Instead, we got Tony. Tony seems a pretty good replacement. He&#8217;s not as quick on the insults (which were one of Peter&#8217;s trademarks), but he&#8217;s a lot more generous with the sake. No-one seemed to mind.<br />
As I previously mentioned, I bailed on the roller-skating. I wanted to be relatively alive the following day. I had plans. Big ones.<br />
I even woke up early. Well, sort of. Earlier than I normally do on a Saturday, but early enough. I was going to make a trip up to the northwest quadrant to visit a car dealership. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that I need a new car. My current one is fine, but I want something newer. Something funkier. Sure, I could very easily keep the car I&#8217;ve got, but let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; I&#8217;m young, I&#8217;m (fairly) well off, and I think I can afford something far more fun than my &#8217;91 Plymouth Acclaim. Could I buy a new Chrysler? Sure. A new GM? I suppose so. How &#8217;bout a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan? Definitely. Do I want to? Not really. At the moment, there&#8217;s only one car I actually want.<br />
A Mini.<br />
Possibly the single most impractical car I could imagine, save for a two-seater coupe. The question is, of course, do I need a practical car? The answer is &#8220;heck no&#8221;! I&#8217;ve got a house with no plans to move any time soon. I&#8217;m not married, and the only dependants I have right now are two cats and an inanimate house.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Geoff&#8217;s hit his mid-life crisis&#8221;. Maybe I have, but I have to say that my father went through more exotic cars by my age than I&#8217;ve had cars, period! I figure, I&#8217;ve earned it. (Okay, maybe I haven&#8217;t &#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t want to have fun!)<br />
At any rate, I went up to the sole Mini dealership in town, and flagged me down a car salesman. Doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; just look like you want to buy. We walked, we talked, we inspected, and we rejected. Finally, he hauled me downstairs to their protected underground garage, and we hopped into one of the cars for a little zip around the area.<br />
The salesman, Michael, drove first. Along the way, he told me a little about himself and a lot about the car. It&#8217;s a fairly impressive bit of engineering. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t Minis little more than a patch of tinfoil wrapped around an engine?&#8221; The original Austin Minis were known for their &#8230; well &#8230; mini-ness. They were small, light, and little more than go-karts with substantial chassis. The new ones were redesigned from the group up by BMW, and contain mostly BMW parts. Think of a 325i crammed into half the size.<br />
I guess I need not mention that it&#8217;s a great drive? It&#8217;s also a bit of a weird drive. While I wanted to give the manual a spin, my experience with a stick shift is a little weak. I opted instead for the automatic. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, does it? This ain&#8217;t no ordinary automatic. It&#8217;s a continuous shifting transmission. In short: No gears. It&#8217;s a large steel belt that slides up and down cone-shaped driveshaft. It&#8217;s pretty ingenious. And you don&#8217;t ever feel a gear shift. It&#8217;s a little unnerving at first.<br />
The question, naturally, is: Can I afford it? I&#8217;ve got my financial advisor working on it. I expect a negative result. I might be well off, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m *that* well off. Hey, I gotta try!<br />
I left the dealership carless &#8230; well, Mini-less. (I still have my Acclaim.) There were other events of the day to tackle, and I needed to get home fairly fast. I still had to tidy up the main floor a little (it&#8217;s looking more like a U-Store than a dining room), sweep the floors, shower, change into something a little more appropriate, and head out to the Zoo.<br />
Why the Zoo? Critical Mass did not have a Christmas Party in December, like we had in the past. This year, for what reasons I&#8217;m not entirely sure, we delayed the party until the latter part of January. Unlike the visit to the Scandinavian Centre (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]), this was at the brand-new Destination Africa exhibit at the Calgary Zoo.<br />
It&#8217;s impressive. According to our tour guide, the Zoo spent over $31 million overhauling the exhibits, giving the animals more room (and more comfort), and increasing the educational value of the Zoo itself. In fact, the entire Zoo is undergoing a series of radical changes. In the coming years, other parts will be upgraded to increase available space, and improve animal&#8217;s living conditions.<br />
Which is important when you have -25 degree weather and animals that live in climates that are usually 50 degrees warmer.<br />
Our party didn&#8217;t start until 4:00. I met up with Shantie at the Zoo C-Train station and proceeded to start on a tour of the Zoo. I&#8217;d never been there before. Shantie&#8217;s been an annual visitor, usually because of nieces and nephews. But the Zoo had changed quite a lot since she&#8217;d last been there. And with the wind whipping around, we made a point to enter the nearest warm building we could find.<br />
We went to the Transalta Rainforest first. But more on that place later. Next, we braved the brisk outside and raced over to the greenhouses, where the Zoo has recreated a rainforest and a desert environment. It&#8217;s almost all plants, except for songbirds in the rainforest, and a couple of meerkats in the desert.<br />
Plunging back outside, we hopped over to the Large Mammals building, which save for a pair of ostriches (which Shantie knows a lot about &#8212; her father used to raise them), a couple of elephants, a warthog, a flock of peahens, and a tapir, was mostly empty. Most of the animals are being moved to the Savannah building &#8212; I figure the Large Mammals building is on the list for overhaul.<br />
We circled the rest of the Zoo, our pace quickening with each second we were outside. The trip back was torture, as we now headed into the wind. I lost feeling in my ears. My thighs were going numb. By the time we reached the African Lodge, we were probably running risk of frostbite. The warm air of the Lodge was very welcome.<br />
The tour began about 20 minutes after we arrived. Our guide, Stuart, took a group of us from the Lodge and into the Rainforest. Now we get back to what I skipped before. The Rainforest building is new &#8212; only opened about two weeks ago. It&#8217;s very impressive &#8212; all the trees are real (except the baobab &#8212; it&#8217;s a cold air return duct), and there are animals everywhere. Two of the most impressive parts are the gorilla enclosure, and the aviary.<br />
The gorilla enclosure is massive. It&#8217;s got a huge indoor area that you can view from several angles, a small outdoor &#8220;winter&#8221; enclosure, and a rather large outdoor summer enclosure. The family of nine apes gets along quite well, save for the newbie. (She was raised by humans and hasn&#8217;t quite figured out that she&#8217;s actually a gorilla.)<br />
The enclosure was also supposed to have a set of Colobus monkeys. However, it seemed that the keepers and the architects couldn&#8217;t really overcome one minor problem: Colobus monkeys are really devious. The enclosure is hot-wired &#8212; there are electrical lines that run the perimeter of the main area, and even up the trunks of three trees. Fences prevent escape, and the surfaces are non-graspable. Didn&#8217;t stop the monkeys. The just upped and ran. Luckily, the building goes into lockdown in cases like that, so the monkeys couldn&#8217;t get away.<br />
The aviary is completely netted off, for a similar reason. So far, nothing&#8217;s escaped. Impressive when the birds could probably fly between the mesh if they tried (or rip it open), and there are three ring-tailed lemurs inside. The lemurs are a hoot to watch. When we&#8217;d come through the first time, you could barely see them amongst the massive support poles. But this time, the lemurs were in plain sight &#8212; 70 feet up in the rafters of the roof. The must love the heights.<br />
From the Rainforest we moved to the Savannah &#8212; a huge building that houses warthogs, porcupines, a nasty-lookin&#8217; vulture, two giraffes, and two hippos. Unlike the Rainforest, you can see pretty much everything in the building from anywhere. The central point, of course, is the 80,000 litre hippo tank. Ungainly on land, these creatures swim like ballerinas when submerged.<br />
Returning to the Lodge, most of Critical Mass&#8217; employees had arrived with their guests. The lobby was full of chatting people, with others having moved into the hall. The entire building has an African motif (for obvious reasons), which include the paint on the walls, the tablecloths, and the main chandelier &#8212; a dugout outrigger, fitted with lights in the hull.<br />
Dinner was buffet-style, nothing overly fancy. But all very tasty. The difficult part was seating &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of tables. The centre of the room had a wood floor, which was surrounded by chairs, and filled with various instruments. This was part of our entertainment for the night.<br />
Not long after dinner, the music started. People took seats around a small group of people in the middle. Instructions were given, and the people in the middle (not C-Massers, but musicians hired for the job) started to play. All the instruments, save for a single keyboard and one guitar, were all percussion.<br />
It was a drumming circle, for lack of any better term to use. The musicians in the centre started the rhythm, which everyone else picked up on. The leader slowly brought everyone in until there was a single pulsating chorus of drums, cowbells, and shakers. The leader rose the sound up, and took it down as a conductor would lead an orchestra. The energy was amazing.<br />
An hour later, most people were drummed out. It takes a lot of energy, and a few people had a headache from it. (The room&#8217;s acoustics are quite good, so you could hear very well.) Following the drumming was, of course, dancing. Few people danced at first, partly because everyone was a little tired from drumming, and also because Critical Mass is like a high school at times, and no-one wants to be the first out.<br />
The DJ compensated by starting a conga line. It weaved all around, trying to suck up people. It was quite successful, but the line broke so often that we ended up with about a half-dozen lines running through the building.<br />
The show closed down at midnight, sharp. That was the rule from the start. We picked ourselves up, aimed for the door, and waited for the shuttle bus. Although the wind had died for the night, it had to be nearly -30 outside. This is the second time Critical Mass has had these temperatures for their holiday season festivities. (The last time, I walked &#8212; or rather, stumbled &#8212; about 15 blocks back to my apartment. Luckily, I was insulated by a protective shield of booze at the time.) Shantie gave me a lift home, rather than freeze on the C-Train.<br />
The only thing that was really missing from our soiree? No drunken stupidity. In what is probably a first for a Critical Mass function, everyone left relatively sober.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m as puzzled as you are.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s the beginning of the year. It&#8217;s quiet. I&#8217;m (somewhat) relaxed. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve got a cold.  At least, I think it&#8217;s a cold. It doesn&#8217;t behave like most rhinovirii I&#8217;ve had in the past &#8212; no fever, no stuffy feeling, no constantly-dripping nose. In fact, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s actually given me anything. Although it has taken something away&#8230;<br />
My voice. I can barely whisper, let alone say something.<br />
[Insert thunderous cheers from everyone sitting around me here.]<br />
Yes, many people around here have been enjoying the drop in noise level. I&#8217;ve even had a few people mention that things seem different, only to find that I can&#8217;t say anything. And, of course, I&#8217;ve had those jokers who seem to think that it&#8217;s their responsibility to make comments about my vocal disability, even to the point of deliberately asking me questions that I need to answer.<br />
I have to remember to cough on their keyboards.<br />
It&#8217;s a weird feeling. My larynx has an an extremely faint soreness to it, but that might just be from me clearing my throat when trying to say something. Otherwise, I feel fine. In fact, I&#8217;ve forgotten more than once that I can&#8217;t say anything today, until I hear that airy chirp that emits from my mouth. I don&#8217;t have a frog in my throat, I&#8217;ve got a mouse.<br />
This all started yesterday morning. I came to work with a sore throat. I thought it was due to dryness in the house. Barely halfway into the morning, I could hear my voice cracking. It was puberty all over again. By the end of the day, talking was forced. (I had to take Spaz to the vet again last night. More pills to ease her breathing. Now if the little furball would just take them&#8230;)<br />
When I woke up this morning, I thought I was fine again. Then I tried to talk to the cat. (Yes, I talk to the cat.) Squeak. Spaz snapped her head up, thinking she heard a mouse. I tried to say something again. Squeak. Spaz stared at me hungrily. Nothing like a just-shy-of-six-foot tall mouse! I opted to shower before she got any ideas.<br />
So today, I have relied tremendously on the modern technology of text. Email and ICQ have been my best friends today, allowing me to continue with my job without saying a word. Of course, Allard still likes to ask a question or two, making me cringe at what I&#8217;m going to sound like next.<br />
I just hope this starts going away soon. The pack of cats following me around is getting a little worrisome.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Another year, come and gone&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t. This has perhaps been the single most turbulent year of my life. I had the deep low of my father&#8217;s death, coupled with the meteoric high of participating with the CBC 50th Anniversary train. Many times I thought I was going to lose my sanity or even my job. Perseverence, not to mention blind faith, helps moves things forward. But I did live up to a few things last year (see [[2001, A Year in Review]]): I spent more time out of the office. Not really getting a life, but it&#8217;s a start.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This has simultaneously been the quietest and the busiest Christmas season I think I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I had been looking forward to two weeks of quiet rest, working on personal projects, sleeping, watching movies, and trying my darnedest to relax before the beginning of the new year.<br />
Life loves to mess around with my plans.<br />
Officially off on 20 December, I resolved to sleep &#8230; well, once I had my shopping done. So on the 21st, I wandered down to Chinook (via the C-Train, mostly because I knew parking would be a disaster) and see what I could see. I saw little, except hoardes of people all trying to find the perfect gift. I decided to try my little trick of last year &#8212; find what I want, see a matinee, and shop when everyone else had gone home for dinner. Only problem: No movie I hadn&#8217;t already seen was available at the right time. I had to return to shopping &#8230; but only at two stores. I retreated to downtown where things tend to make more sense.<br />
My mother arrived in town on the 23rd. The plan, originally, was to have the entire family out in this neck of the woods. But Cathy and Craig ended up stranded in Southern Ontario. Airfare, especially during the Christmas season, is far too pricey for people in the midst of a kitchen renovation. We would miss most of their precence this year &#8212; the second Christmas that Cathy and I would spend apart.<br />
The first Saturday and Sunday were occupied with me running errands and cleaning. I didn&#8217;t know when family was going to start dropping by. I had also hoped to finish my Christmas shopping before then. Ya, right. I didn&#8217;t finish shopping right up until the 24th &#8212; my usual timeframe.<br />
One of these days, I&#8217;ll have enough smarts to start earlier. Probably when I can get someone else to do it for me&#8230;<br />
I spent Christmas Eve with two of my closest friends, Tara and Scott, and our friend Geoff. (Yes, having two Geoffs in the same room makes conversation challenging. Getting the both of them drunk makes it funny.) It was a seafood smorgasbord: shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster. We ate, laughed, and carried on until into the wee hours. Mostly because we had to make sure Geoff (the other one) was &#8220;safe&#8221; to go home. Geoff, it seems, has an allergy to shellfish.<br />
The one day I had been really looking forward to was Christmas morning. I was looking forward to sleeping in. Tamara was with her family out past Tisdale, Saskatchewan. It was just me and the cats. And a 7:30 wake-up call. I had to pick up my mom from her hotel. The story had unfolded the day before:<br />
Me (picking up the phone): Hello?<br />
Mom: Hi, it&#8217;s me! Here&#8217;s the plan for tomorrow. We&#8217;re going over to Brenda&#8217;s [my aunt]. Pick me up at 8:30.<br />
Me: 8:30 at night? That&#8217;s a little late for dinner, don&#8217;t you think?<br />
Yes, I actually said that. It took me a moment to realize what was really meant.<br />
I spent Christmas morning with my family. It was nice not to have to open presents &#8212; well, I had to open a few, but they were small. After this year, small is the best I could ever want. Dinner was a turkey tsunami &#8212; all wonderful, but as usually, too much. (I ate way too much this holiday season &#8230; as per usual.)<br />
Boxing Day is North America&#8217;s single largest day of pure capitalism. It&#8217;s a chance for everyone to become completely moronic, act without care of fellow human, and rack up even more debt. So, yeah, I went shopping.<br />
But not until about 11:00am. I wasn&#8217;t willing to get up early. And I wasn&#8217;t willing to visit any of the main malls. I kept it quiet and simple: A&amp;B Sound and HMV, both downtown, and both in walking distance. A&amp;B Sound was a zoo &#8212; people everywhere, and none of them really finding what they seemed to be looking for. Of course, the store had opened at 7:00am, and people had started lining up at midnight. That kind of thing I just do not understand.<br />
On the 28th, we celebrated Nana&#8217;s 90th birthday. Nana is my sole living grandparent. Her actual birthday isn&#8217;t until late January, but this was the most convenient time to have most of her family come and celebrate with her all at once. So for one night, we zipped one month into the future to wish Nana a happy birthday. Even Cathy and Craig made an &#8220;appearance&#8221;, through the magic of pre-recorded messages on video tape.<br />
Like almost every Tisdale clan affair, it was met with far too much good food. I arrived almost four hours ahead of Nana (she was off with my Uncle David, exploring the Kananaskis) to help prepare the meals. We had a wide-ranging theme of dishes, including Vietnamese salad rolls, Asian scallops, mini crab cakes (Jen and I spent the better part of an hour cracking crab on the only available surface &#8212; the floor), and the coupe de grace &#8212; a huge roast beef. I didn&#8217;t eat the next day until almost dinner.<br />
Before I knew it, it was Mom&#8217;s last day in town. We spent it partially at the mall, where we browsed several shops, and also at my home, where she visited with Spaz. There is never enough time for everything, though &#8212; soon, she was back at the airport, and I was watching her through security on her flight back to Toronto.<br />
New Year&#8217;s Eve &#8212; a night when most people (like Tamara) go out and have fun. Me? I watched Minority Report, The Emperor&#8217;s New Groove, and barely half of Lord of the Rings before I called it a night. I wasn&#8217;t interested in going out. It&#8217;s been a hard year. It was a night I wanted to spend alone.<br />
With all the family, activity, and distractions, I didn&#8217;t start feeling really relaxed until this morning. I woke just before 11:00am, and ventured downstairs to watch TV. Exciting, eh? But I had a reason &#8212; today, in theory, would be my moment of national fame. In theory, I&#8217;d be on CBC.<br />
Following the Governor-General&#8217;s and Prime Minister&#8217;s messages to the country, CBC aired the last remaining show of their 50th Anniversary celebrations &#8212; a 50-minute documentary of the CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train. I got to sit and watch friends again, new footage I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and a few surprises I hadn&#8217;t expected. Hopefully now, people can understand what I did, and why I have so much difficulty trying to explain what it was like.<br />
And this is how my year begins &#8212; with a new sense of being, sense of future, and a desire to experience more that this world of ours has to offer. That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t do a lot this year. But that&#8217;s another email&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Assuming you&#8217;re not avoiding the media or living under a rather large rock, you&#8217;ve probably heard that the second chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy opened today.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I&#8217;ve already seen it.<br />
A few weeks ago (over a month, actually), the Famous Players Paramount Chinook theatre started selling tickets for opening night. First showing: 12:01am.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: That&#8217;s when we saw it.<br />
There were originally just three of us: Adrian, Tamara, and myself. But Jensenne caught wind, and wanted to tag along. The more, the merrier, I say! Besides, then I have more &#8220;normal&#8221; people to stand around so I don&#8217;t look like such a dork being surrounded by obsessed Tolkien fans. (Okay, yes, I was there at midnight for a movie &#8230; but it&#8217;s a good movie!)  And believe me, there were a number of them. They started lining up early. At noon.<br />
Yup, a full twelve hours before the movie started. Why? Good question &#8212; I&#8217;m sure their lives can&#8217;t be so empty of fulfillment that 12 hours is nothing to them. Mind you, Star Wars fans tend more to the obsessive side. Both Tolkien and Star Wars fans are geeky &#8212; can&#8217;t avoid that one. They get really wrapped up in the story, the characters, the ethos of the whole thing. But there are differences between the two. Tolkien fans dress up as characters. Star Wars fans are the characters.<br />
Then there&#8217;s Trekkies. Let&#8217;s not go there.<br />
John was the first person in our group to arrive on the scene, and mostly by accident. He was in the theatre for another reason, and happened to notice &#8212; at 6:00pm &#8212; that the line was already underway. Due to the fortunes of modern technology, the line would form quickly. Our team would fall into place in line, myself being the last to arrive around 9:00pm. (There&#8217;s another whole story to that, but I&#8217;ll spare you the tangent.)<br />
There were noticeable people in the line. A couple were dressed up in costume. One carried a sign on a staff that read: &#8220;One sign to rule them all.&#8221; (Hey, I said Tolkien fans were reserved &#8212; I didn&#8217;t say they were any less geeky than the others.) The group sitting behind us brought &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; Risk &#8212; until that time unopened. The drawback was that none of them had played before. By the time they&#8217;d gotten underway, we had to move the line again. The single best way to kill time in line was the guy who&#8217;d brought a laptop with a DVD player. I&#8217;ll give you three guesses what movie he played.<br />
And no, it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#8221;.<br />
The line formed quickly. Within an hour of my arrival, we&#8217;d already had to shuffle the line twice to prevent blocking other doors. By 10:00, there were so many people in line, we couldn&#8217;t sit down anymore. Sardines have more room. People had to get creative with ways to keep from going mildly mental standing in the line. Tamara got smart and brought playing cards a Nintendo Gameboy. Which, in retrospect, was her downfall&#8230;<br />
A-Channel (a local independent television station) sent out a camera crew to get footage of the freaks in line. Tamara laughed about this, mocking the few at the front who would likely stand out the most. So imagine her surprise, and our amusement, when an A-Channel camera peered over her shoulder as she played Tetris, then thrust a microphone in her face to ask her a question about how she had prepared to stand in line. There&#8217;s nothing like actually seeing the look of &#8220;Please God, not me&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Twenty minutes, and we were in the theatre. After standing for well over an hour, it was good to sit down again. Snacks, a quick run through the washroom, and it was magic time&#8230;<br />
A little over three hours later, we filtered out of the screening (some of us making fast dashes for the washrooms) and headed off into the quiet Wednesday morning. We made a fairly hasty return home. I had to be at work this morning, as per usual. Three hours&#8217; sleep really doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. Good thing work is slow right now.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I fell asleep at work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that I could no longer stall. I had put it off for years, and it wasn&#8217;t really helping me. In fact, my apathy about the entire situation was appalling. To move ahead in such a fashion was foolish, to say the least, and would almost certainly hamper my future.<br />
It was time to buy another computer.<br />
For the last six-odd years, I&#8217;ve been working on an inferior Gateway P133 laptop. It&#8217;s old, heavy, the screen is slowly going, and the CD-ROM drive has been nothing but a nuisance for a very long time. And well, it&#8217;s old, slow, and not really suitable for the things I want to do with a computer. (That includes Internet access, running web servers, using more recent operating systems, and yes, playing video games.)<br />
I looked at Apple, long and hard. I&#8217;ve spent most of my computing life (about 99% of it) on PCs of one form or another. The PC arms race is beyond irritating, and the idea of constantly supporting them really didn&#8217;t sit well with me. Macs are much simpler, I can still do most of my job on them, and that new iMac was worth drooling over (especially the one with the wide screen).<br />
But after much information gathering, not to mention a fair bit of soul searching, I had to come to the conclusion that I would have to purchase a PC. Not my most favourite of conclusions. But at least it was a direction. Now for a vendor.<br />
My initial thought was Dell. I&#8217;d had a bad experience with Gateway 2000 some time ago, so I wasn&#8217;t really too keen on mail-order computers (or Internet-order, for that matter). But Dell has an impressive track record, and I have yet to hear a really disparaging comment about their systems. Besides, the laptop I used when I was with the CBC (software notwithstanding) was so impressive, that their desktop computers can&#8217;t all be bad.<br />
I searched, I priced, and I bought: Pentium 4 2.4GHz system with 512 MB RAM, an 80 GB hard drive, a 48x CD-ROM drive, a 4x DVD-R/CD-RW drive, IEEE 1394 ports, Turtle Beach sound card, an nVidia GeForce4 MX video card, a 17&#8243; LCD flat panel display, and some really nice speakers. No, it wasn&#8217;t cheap (the monitor really jacked up the price), but it was worth it.<br />
Almost.<br />
I had no Internet. When you live and breathe hypertext transfer protocol, you really do need a constant connection. And I ain&#8217;t talkin&#8217; about the measly 56k modem installed in the computer. I mean ASDL or Cable access. 24/7. All the information I could ever want, whenever I wanted it. Problem: Tamara already had it.<br />
Well, okay, that&#8217;s not really a problem. But it meant that we needed another port. Shaw charges $10 a month for an extra port. That seems just a little silly to me, since it&#8217;s no skin off their backs. Especially when for $130, I can purchase a little router that will allow up to four computers from our house to surf the &#8216;net or communicate with each other. But first, to find a router.<br />
That took a little longer, but surprisingly enough, not too long. My first stop was at Memory Express &#8212; *the* place to find computer parts in Calgary. Sold out. For a week. Who&#8217;da thunk there&#8217;d be a run on routers at this time of the year? But the Memory Express staff is extremely helpful &#8212; they suggested I try Compusmart down the road.<br />
Compusmart is one of those stores I try to avoid: flashy, high-flallutin&#8217; (at least so far as computer stores go), and the salespeople tend to be a little pushy. But they had the router I wanted. Then I tried a little tactic &#8212; did they do price matching? Luckily for me, they did. I pointed the salesman to Memory Express&#8217; website. Same router, and now the same price.<br />
Back at home, I pulled the router out of its box and did something I don&#8217;t normally do: read the instructions. This was because I was about to seriously screw around with Tamara&#8217;s computer, and she wasn&#8217;t there for me to ask for permission. Whatever I was about to do, I wanted to make sure that I could restore my changes and not affect her one bit.<br />
I read the sheet carefully (it fold out to the approximate size of a city map), then went into Tamara&#8217;s room and plugged the router into the electrical socket, plugged the Internet feed from the modem into the router, Tamara&#8217;s computer into the router, and my computer into the router.<br />
It took more time for me to read the instructions than it did for me to start surfing the web. A few years ago, this would have been like pulling teeth. I honestly can&#8217;t believe it was this easy! Suddenly, Macs aren&#8217;t quite so appealing.<br />
So I&#8217;m finally going to be mildly productive at home. Basically, I can do my own work on my own terms, instead of having to go to to office to use a computer.<br />
Now I can just figure out how to telecommute&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Tuesday (12 November 2002), the extended version of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released on DVD. The standard theatrical release came out a few months ago, but this was the one I was waiting for &#8212; more material, worth the price I was going to pay.<br />
The bold idea, of course, was to really show this movie. In fact, it was about as good an excuse as any to hold the first true &#8220;Movie Night&#8221; in my house. Chris and I used to hold movie nights all the time in our apartment, but due to lack of time, space, furniture, and the fact that at times my home looked more like the aftermath of a F-5 tornado than a house pretty much kept large events at bay.<br />
Until now.<br />
This release was reason enough to drag out a considerable number of people to my home, sit down, and listen to the movie at a volume that would deafen most teenagers. The subwoofer was turned up so much the floor shook. I&#8217;m sure that if my windows didn&#8217;t have brass strip accents, they would have rattled. The room was dark, and everyone had goosepimples. It was great.<br />
We paused the movie a couple of times, one for the when Virgil&#8217;s pizza arrived, a second (much longer) time when our Chinese food arrived (it had been far too long since our last Chinese dinner), and one last time when the first disc ended.<br />
Yes, the &#8220;first&#8221; disc. The extended version is on four discs. No, the movie itself doesn&#8217;t extend across all four &#8212; just the first two. Why so long? Well, the movie itself is 208 minutes &#8212; that&#8217;s pretty long, even for a DVD. Tack on a small army of extra audio channels, and suddenly you&#8217;ve got too much information for one measly little DVD disc.<br />
So we took a slight break. I popped out the first disc, swapped in the second, and pressed play. And then I crossed my fingers.<br />
Why cross fingers? That&#8217;s to compensate for my rather bad luck. You see, I had the set still in the A&amp;B plastic bag, and sealed in its wrapper. I hadn&#8217;t opened it. I wanted to preserve it so that its first real viewing would be in front of my friends. Naturally, that meant that it wouldn&#8217;t work.<br />
Have I ever mentioned that Murphy is my best friend?<br />
At first, the disc took an inordinately long time to load. My first thought: this wasn&#8217;t loading. There, that was my problem! Oh well, my luck &#8230; the disc finished loading and the title came up on the display. Huh &#8212; how &#8217;bout that, no problem! Well&#8230; so I thought, until I heard:<br />
Them: &#8220;Geoff, you doofus! You put the first disc in!&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s the right one!&#8221; (I check the discs, just to make sure.)<br />
Them: &#8220;Then why is the first disc&#8217;s contents on-screen?&#8221;<br />
I scratched my head. The first disc was in the case. I popped the disc out. Disc Two.<br />
Me: &#8220;Ha! This is the second disc!&#8221;<br />
Them: &#8220;Ha! You should have checked your copy before inviting us over!&#8221;<br />
They had a point.<br />
It appears that A&amp;B received a batch of bad copies of the movie. Somehow, I should have expected this. In fact, I pretty much did. This is how much luck tends to go. But where there&#8217;s a will (or a great deal of stubbornness), there&#8217;s a way. A nearby Blockbuster also helps.<br />
Not surprisingly, their copies were all rented. Audrey, however, took charge, and asked if there were any copies &#8220;lying around&#8221; that we could rent. Nada. Audrey didn&#8217;t stop, and had them check other stores. One of the nearby Blockbusters had one copy remaining.<br />
A mere viewing of the movie wasn&#8217;t enough. No, we had to engage our own quest for the ring. Audrey, Adrian, Calvin, and myself braved the treacherous Fire Lights of the Tenth Road, the decaying Bridge of Bow, a hurried run past the edge of the Forest of Glass Towers, and onto the hedonistic Avenue of Drunken Morons, finally arriving at the Blockbuster of Mount Doom, er, Royal. Obtaining our movie, we headed north on 14th Aisle of Laggan, before turning into the Hamlet of Kensington, and finally to Hobbiton, I mean, my house.<br />
Lights, DVD, action!<br />
We resumed our movie, revelling in the visual and aural bombardment. The cats wisely stayed out of the living room. The movie finally ended at half-past midnight, a full hour and a half after it should have.<br />
But such is the nature of a quest &#8212; you never know when it will truly end.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It doesn&#8217;t take long for me to get back into the swing of (some) things. I&#8217;m already working on trains again. This time, it&#8217;s the locomotive from which I caught the train chasing bug.<br />
I got a call from Don on Saturday, wanting the tapes I shot for 6060&#8217;s trip out to Jasper last year (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]). We chatted briefly, then mentioned that I should drop by the roundhouse at CP&#8217;s Alyth Yard to see 2816 all steamed up. Asking if the engine were heading back to Vancouver for a six-month inspection or more work, Don replied that 2816 was making a run from Calgary to Banff and back with some of CP&#8217;s executives. I was to drop by around 11:00am on Sunday.<br />
When I arrived, Don&#8217;s truck was nowhere in sight. Having never been here before, and coming at Don&#8217;s invitation &#8212; not CP&#8217;s &#8212; I was careful to wait for my escort. Don arrived shortly afterwards, and I followed him in.<br />
2816 was not out in the yard, or even on the turntable (as I&#8217;d hoped). It was tucked inside, the smokebox cover completely removed, the superheater covers removed, and four men milling around inside. Present were Bill (2816&#8217;s lead engineer), Jim (CP employee, RMRS member, and steam locomotive engineer &#8212; Jim had run 6060 to Jasper with us last year), Al Broadfoot (who supervised 2816&#8217;s overhaul), and another man who I&#8217;d never met before.<br />
It seemed that the night before, after Don had left, Bill noticed an odd noise in the smokebox. Upon investigation, he found steam eminating from one of the flue tubes. That could mean only one thing &#8212; a superheater had burst.<br />
We had arrived to find them in the midst of removing superheater tubes. Luckily, they knew exactly which one was giving them trouble, but it was tucked behind a couple of other tubes that needed to be removed first. This involved using an overhead crane for support, and a forklift for leverage. Superheater tubes, especially in larger locomotives, are extremely heavy. Removing them by hand is torture (or so I&#8217;m told by the 6060 crew, who had to do just that).<br />
I didn&#8217;t directly participate. Partly because Bill and Al don&#8217;t know me, but also because I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;ve never seen this done before, let alone participated. I fell into my role of gopher. (Which I&#8217;m quite comfortable at, especially with people who know a lot more than I do.) That basically meant a coffee run.)<br />
While all this was happening, I had long chats with Al. It would appear that my education of Al has been woefully one-sided. I&#8217;ve heard lots of stories and some generally not nice things about him. I&#8217;d always been a little skeptical &#8230; but not enough. Al seems to be a genuinely honest man, trying to keep locomotives in good running shape. This is what I gathered talking to him directly. He actually mourned the RMRS&#8217; lack of a proper shop to maintain 6060. (This is something everyone agrees with.) Needless to say, if for nothing else, I&#8217;m glad I went just so I could talk with Al.<br />
The troubled superheater soon slid out of the boiler. As it popped out and was slowly lowered to the ground, water seeped from the bend. Etched in the forged piece was a tiny hole, about 1/16th of an inch across. Possibly a thin-walled area, aggravated by a grape (a weld that has pooled into a sphere on the inside) causing an eddy, bored right through the side.<br />
Normally, this would sideline a locomotive. But with CP&#8217;s resources, it&#8217;s a matter of cutting off the offending piece and getting in a welder to attach a new bend. Jim knew a good one in town who could come the following day to fix it.<br />
We left 2816 in the roundhouse, covers off, superheaters laid out, awaiting repairs. It almost looked like a patient anxiously awaiting a dentist to fill a cavity. It&#8217;s due to run to Banff (Bamf!) on Friday. I&#8217;m pretty sure it will.</p>
