	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You&#8217;d think I&#8217;d have learned from my jaunt out on Thursday night (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]). I guess I did to a point, but I made one key error: I went out to celebrate Jim&#8217;s birthday.<br />
For the record, Jim&#8217;s a great guy. He&#8217;s a lot of fun &#8212; he has no inhibitions to speak of, he lives more on the edge than most (especially when it comes to skiing), and lives for the moment. He&#8217;s a great web developer, he&#8217;s inquisitive, and is always interested in pushing the boundaries of website development. Unlike most people, Jim doesn&#8217;t really have a shell to come out of &#8212; he wears pretty much all his internal organs on his sleeves.<br />
What&#8217;s all this mean? Well, when you receive an invitation from Jim, asking you to attend an evening of drinking, you can immediately know where it&#8217;ll likely head. The fact that today is Jim&#8217;s 26th birthday made events of last night all the more &#8230; necessary.<br />
I arrived at Jim&#8217;s apartment (a two-minute walk from the venerable Rose &amp; Crown pub) shortly after 20:00, the approximate time we were asked to arrive. Upon entering the apartment to the loud calls of Scott (who&#8217;d arrived mere moments before me), James (already quite well into the bag), and two of Jim&#8217;s friends (whose names I&#8217;m drawing a blank on), I was informed of the house rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No smoking inside. (No worries there.)</li>
<li>No throwing large objects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than that, there were no other rules. But there was a bit of preparation.<br />
As each person arrived, they had to roll dice. For most people, it was three. Women only had to roll two. Mia and Lindsay got away with only one &#8212; Mia was on antibiotics, so was taking a (wisely) careful approach. The number you rolled were the number of drinks you had to have before the night was over. The rules (as stated by Jim) meant that all ones were actually sevens. Thusly, the drink minimum was six, and the maximum was 21. Jim (and Luke, the co-birthday boy) each had to drink 26, because that&#8217;s their new age.<br />
I rolled a 17. Figures. James rolled a 20. He finished even before we left for the Rose &amp; Crown.<br />
To ensure that everyone had their share, you strung the number of candies (taken from a candy necklace) onto a piece of dental floss, which you wore around your necklace. For each drink you finished, you ate one of the candies. Beers and shots counted as one. For pints, it was in groups of three: first pint was a single drink, the next two were two drinks each, for a total of five.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if anyone every really put that rule to the test.<br />
With most of the group assembled around 23:30, we departed for the Rose &amp; Crown (Mia and Lindsay had come and gone by that time). It was cold, but the alcohol kept us (somewhat) warm. Luke bypassed the pub, saying he needed food. He never came back. We kept going at the Rose &amp; Crown, talking drinking, and eating nachos until &#8230; well, until you couldn&#8217;t hang out any longer.<br />
I stopped around 1:30 or so. I was out of money (I had budgeted myself as a limiting device) and feeling kinda tired. I also didn&#8217;t want to relive Friday when I woke up later this morning. So it was off towards home, stopping at Canadian Pizza Unlimited for a little repast, and at the Mac&#8217;s to pick up a litre of Gatorade and a small bag of chips. (Gatorade restores the salts, etc. your body loses while drinking.)<br />
Falling asleep on the couch, I awoke only when Tamara came crashing through the door around 4:00. I don&#8217;t wholly remember her return. I just rolled over and went back to sleep. I haven&#8217;t slept that well in a long time.<br />
Aside from being really tired, I had a much better day than on Friday. Oddly enough, it felt really good to just laze around for a change. It&#8217;s been a while since I outright relaxed. I can only imagine what kind of a day Jim must&#8217;ve had. But something tells me that he wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was not so great &#8212; he almost certainly had a great time last night.<br />
As for me, I think I&#8217;m going to remain sober for a while yet to come. Two nights of debauchery in such close proximity isn&#8217;t good for me. I might begin to like it.<br />
Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering, no, I didn&#8217;t finish the 17. I might have actually had 13 drinks, including shots. Even then, I&#8217;m not too sure. It was probably less &#8212; I cheated a couple of times.</p>

		<blockquote><p>There were green alligators, and long necked geese,<br />

<p>There are all sorts of smart things one can do on a school night. Getting drunk ain&#8217;t one of them.<br />
For those of you no longer in the scholastic world, a &#8220;school night&#8221; is no different than those you experienced at school. Basically, most weekday nights (not counting Friday) and Sunday night. So named because you have to get up early in the morning, file yourself off to a building, and concentrate on things that you might not otherwise like doing.<br />
For the last three days, I&#8217;ve been in all-day meetings. We&#8217;re planning out the 2004 projects for Mercedes-Benz. Now that I&#8217;m part of the lead team, I now participate in these meetings. They&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. We sort out all sorts of issues and really get a good feel for the direction we want to take the account.<br />
But they are draining.<br />
It&#8217;s like having a Martian Brain Sucker attached to your skull all day. By the end of it, you&#8217;re exhausted. The advantage is that you feel really good about the work you&#8217;ve done. All in in all, it&#8217;s a good experience.<br />
&#8216;Course, the best part is the dinner that follow the last day. That&#8217;s when the MB team goes out for dinner. Well, &#8220;dinner&#8221; is a subjective term, since we eat a little and drink a lot. (The amount of drinking varies, usually inversely proportionate to how smart you are about when to stop.) But it&#8217;s all fun.<br />
To make things more interesting, I didn&#8217;t leave right at the end of the day. You see, irony of ironies, the site that I worked on directly (and for which we were having the dinner), MBUSA.com, was down. It had been down since about 11:00 that morning. All because of a database edit. A fairly simple thing, really, which is why we were so utterly puzzled when the &#8220;fix&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.<br />
When 17:00 rolled around, the fixing was still at full speed. I got the skinny on what was going on (I only knew during the day that there was a problem, but not exactly what it was) and tried to understand what part of the problem was. (There was a lot of Java discussion, which I don&#8217;t possess enough of an understanding to truly grasp.) In a nutshell, there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to help.<br />
So I went out to get drunk.<br />
Well, that wasn&#8217;t so much the intention so much as the result. And lest ye be thinking I&#8217;m turning into a raging alcoholic, please rest your fears. Now I know there are a number of stories that always seem to start: &#8220;So we went out to get drunk&#8230;&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I don&#8217;t live my entire week like that &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have made it 31 years if I did. Just that the drinking stories are usually the most fun.<br />
The Wildwood Pub is one of the nicer places in town to meet. It used to be a lot better. Sadly, as I found out last night, their beer quality has begun to sink dramatically. Peter, our newest copywriter, was telling me to avoid the stuff. I should have listened. Between Peter and myself, we tried every variety of beer they had (there&#8217;s only six or seven of &#8217;em). They were all bad. We both switched to Keith&#8217;s.<br />
I think I ended up being the only technology person in attendance. (Most of the others, sadly, were trapped at the office trying to resolve the site problem. The fix, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was to restore a previous backup of the database.) So I guess I felt a responsibility to represent. [Insert cliched reference to LA gangland-style comrades here.]<br />
That might have been what possessed me to drink beer a little too quickly. Either way, a good time was had. So good, in fact, that eventually, it was down to just five people: Dan (the Managing Director &#8212; the Big Kahuna, if you will), Mabel (Dan&#8217;s assistant), Jason (Project Manager), Daryl (Account Manager), and yours truly. That was when Mabel convinced us that we had to go somewhere else.<br />
We retreated to two cars: Mabel&#8217;s and Dan&#8217;s. I rode in Dan&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d never been in a Mercedes-Benz before. (Hey, he *is* the Managing Director. He kind of has to own one.) It&#8217;s nice &#8230; the rear seats are brutally cold, but it is nice. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever own one, though.<br />
Mabel and Dan zig-zagged through Calgary. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I knew where they were going, but we eventually ended up at Mabel&#8217;s apartment, where she ditched her car. The five of us continued in Dan&#8217;s to our destination: Aussie Rules.<br />
Aussie Rules is an Australian bar. (Or at least, it&#8217;s supposed to be.) Now before you think that&#8217;s a little strange, here&#8217;s something else to make you scratch your head: It ain&#8217;t the only one in town. Yes, there is another one: The Flying Emu (okay, so technically, it should be a New Zealand bar), just down from my old apartment.<br />
So you think I&#8217;d see kangaroos, drink Foster&#8217;s, and eat barbecued shrimp, right? Nope. We listened to dueling pianos.<br />
Yes, dueling pianos. Perhaps one of the stranger things to see in a bar. Two pianos (baby grands), facing each other. Two player/singers. But it&#8217;s not a competition &#8212; they play together, banging out whatever songs people request (or whatever they feel like playing). Mabel led us to the table right in front of the stage so we could get the full effect.<br />
We came at an opportune time (which I can only assume was in the vicinity of midnight), as these guys had been playing (and drinking) for a couple of hours. They were definitely well into their silly stage. While they did play great music (they actually did a couple lines out of Gowan&#8217;s &#8220;A Criminal Mind&#8221; on a request I shouted out; they wouldn&#8217;t touch Gordon Lightfoot), they also did a pub favourite. This was Mabel&#8217;s request.<br />
At some point in your life, you&#8217;ve probably heard The Irish Rover&#8217;s &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;. If you listen to it the way the Rovers do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is a very nice song. If you listen to the way the Dueling Pianos do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is an Olympic event.<br />
When the request was made, one of the two pianists (a guy about 40 lbs overweight, I&#8217;d guess) climbed up on top of the piano (I assume it can easily handle the weight of someone on the lid), picked up a microphone, and hopped over to the top of the other piano, and prompted demanded everyone stand up.<br />
Incidentally, I assume they&#8217;ll only do this song after people have been drinking long enough.<br />
So here&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s all about a couple of the verses (here&#8217;s a link, <a href="http://www.irish-rovers.demon.co.uk/lyrics/unicorn.htm">in case you want to know what the lyrics actually are</a>), repeating the chorus often, making the audience mimic the animals mentioned in the chorus, and following the direction of the singer (for example, when he yells: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221;, you point at the bar). If you manage to get to the end with all the motions without laughing yourself to the floor, you&#8217;ve done pretty well.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it. But I didn&#8217;t land on the floor.<br />
Anyway, without going into excrutiating detail (&#8216;cuz you know I could), we had a blast at Aussie Rules. Before we knew it, there was the Last Call. At the time, it didn&#8217;t really click with me what the time probably was. For some reason, I decided that whatever time it was, it wasn&#8217;t really that late. It didn&#8217;t feel that late.<br />
Time flies when you&#8217;re drunk.<br />
We upped and left (paying the bill, of course) and headed towards downtown, dropping Mabel off along the way. Then it was over to the Mercury, another Calgary establishment. I have no idea what time it was when we arrived. It couldn&#8217;t have been too late &#8212; the place was still serving. Dan decided we needed some Irish Whisky to finish off the night.<br />
Dan drove us home. I live somewhat close to Dan, but saved him the trip through Sunnyside by having him drop me off at 2nd Ave and Centre St. From there, it&#8217;s a 20 minute walk home, which I really needed. It gave me enough fresh air to remember to drink a couple glasses of water and take a couple Tylenol to stave off the inevitable hangover.<br />
Tamara had been home barely 30 minutes before I walked in. She laughed. I was a wreck, and she knew it. (Technically, I knew it too, but just wasn&#8217;t willing to acknowledge it.) I had the water, pills, quick run through the bathroom, and crawled into bed somewhere around 3:00.<br />
Well, I assume I crawled into bed. I don&#8217;t really remember that step, but since I woke up in there, that&#8217;s about as close an assumption as I can make. My alarm &#8212; Chris&#8217; stereo which clicks on at 5:20 playing the Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; album (the entire thing &#8212; that&#8217;s over 45 minutes long) &#8212; didn&#8217;t wake me up. Not even remotely. I forgot to set my secondary alarm. Luckily, I have a backup.<br />
It&#8217;s furry, has four feet, and purrs. She also meows really loudly in the morning when she wants to be fed.<br />
At 7:37, I bolted out of bed in a bit of a panic, threw my head under the tap to get the bedhead down, dressed, shaved very quickly, ran a toothbrush across my teeth, and was in the process of about to run out the door when I realized Tamara was still asleep. We carpooled. I don&#8217;t drive to work usually, but considering we had to be at work for 8:00, I made an exception.<br />
The hangover kicked in around 8:30. And it got progressively worse all morning. The more I moved, the worse it got. Fortunately, nothing so serious that I was ready to &#8230; well, y&#8217;know, but I sucked back a few aspirin with ginger ale to try quieten the body. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a greasy lunch at A&amp;W that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Well, as normal as anyone can feel after mimicking a chimpanzee in a Australian bar in suburban Calgary at some ungodly hour of the night because I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for my own good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. And it&#8217;s not even Hallowe&#8217;en yet.<br />
Starting early this week, the weather folk started telling us to prepare for Calgary&#8217;s first snowstorm of the season. This is something we&#8217;ve heard a couple of times before &#8212; some of you might have heard about this &#8220;big dump&#8221; we were supposed to get back in September (we had, at most, a light dusting).<br />
This time, though, they weren&#8217;t wrong. Tuesday, it started raining. And the temperature fell all day. By 20:00, it was snowing. Only colder things (e.g. cars and benches) were gathering an accumulation. Everywhere else it was melting away. I walked home from downtown &#8212; by the time I got there, it was clear that this wasn&#8217;t going to be a simple dusting.<br />
The temperature dropped overnight, and the snow fell harder. By morning, there was at least four inches of snow on my front walk. I debated for a moment on either shovelling before the gym, or dealing with the aftermath when I got home. I chose the latter, mostly because I wanted to get to the gym, and my snow shovel was in the garage.<br />
Before I left, I realized that I would not be able to wear my shoes outside. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve worn running shoes &#8212; the same ones I would wear to work any other given day. Sounds a little chilly, I know, but because I&#8217;m always moving, it&#8217;s never been a problem. But my current choice of footwear was definitely not suited to winter weather.<br />
Thus, I hauled out my pair of winter boots. They had not seen outdoors in over six years. The last time I&#8217;d worn them was when I worked in downtown Toronto. I had to don a second pair of socks (wool ones), as the rubbing of the leather would probably wreak havoc on my poor feet. These boots have massive grip &#8230; on anything that&#8217;s not ice (as I found out this morning when my heel got a little too far ahead of me, and I found myself sitting in the middle of Centre Street).<br />
None of the roads had been ploughed, and only one short segment of the sidewalks in my area had been shovelled (the guy gets up even earlier than I do). Memorial Drive was a mess, as the night time traffic wasn&#8217;t frequent enough to clear the road. Fortunately, the city Peanut Pusher had cleaned off part of the pathway, giving me an easier walk to the Prince&#8217;s Island Park footbridge. The bridge was a little difficult, and the snow was still deep on the other side. I was a couple minutes late getting to the gym.<br />
The snow was still falling heavily when I left the gym over an hour later. The walk to work wasn&#8217;t easy. Although more sidewalks were now clear, they were also quite slippery. (Most hadn&#8217;t put down any salt.) I was about five minutes late getting to work.<br />
Some people were almost two hours late. And people wonder why I live in the inner city&#8230;<br />
It snowed most of the day. It was still snowing when I went home and shovelled the snow from my walkway and sidewalk. (On the bright side, the thick layer of snow obscures the scar where the sewer was replaced &#8212; see 24 September 2003.)<br />
The snow had stopped by this morning. But it was -12 when I left the house for the gym. Minus 12. It&#8217;s not even November yet. The windchill was double that. So say that this is not exactly expected (or desired) is to put it mildly.<br />
And, of course, tomorrow is Hallowe&#8217;en. The forecast is for at least -7, if not colder. You won&#8217;t be seeing any ballerinas, elves, or fairies tomorrow night. This years&#8217; hot costume in Calgary? Inuit.<br />
Snow is forecast for a few days yet to come. We won&#8217;t see above-zero temperatures for at least a week, by the looks of it. This is definitely one of the weirdest autumns I&#8217;ve yet experienced.<br />
I&#8217;m not ready to go walking in a mid-fall (hence, not-quite-winter) wonderland.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I love seeing old friends. I just hate seeing them leave.<br />
Therese was in town this weekend. Not really to visit with people so much (though that was one thing she did), but to defend her dissertation &#8212; the last step in obtaining her PhD. It&#8217;s the end of a very long road for Therese, something she&#8217;s been working hard to complete for over a third of her life.<br />
The defence was on Thursday afternoon. I had vowed to leave her be until then, since I knew that she&#8217;d be in preparations until then. We ended up talking for a while Wednesday afternoon &#8212; Therese called me while she took a little break. I&#8217;m not sure if she called so much for a social conversation, or looking for affirmation. As Therese would explain to me, graduate students often have low self-worth, having been told time and time again their work isn&#8217;t good enough. Luckily, it didn&#8217;t take much to instill faith in her knowledge and wisdom.<br />
Either that, or she was gullible enough to believe me.<br />
Therese&#8217;s defence began at 14:00 Thursday afternoon. Exactly what happened in there, I will never know. (Not that it&#8217;s really any of my business, anyway.) The defence was supposed to last about two hours, after which, Therese would receive her final grade. It&#8217;s a three-point score. If you get a &#8216;1&#8217;, you get champagne. If you get a &#8216;2&#8217;, you get a congratulations. If you don&#8217;t get either, you get to do it over again. Therese would find out around 16:30 what that score was. Ideally, that&#8217;s when I would find out if I had to start calling her &#8220;Doc&#8221;.<br />
16:00 came and went without any news. I called around 16:45, in hopes of catching her before something happened (we were supposed to get together that evening). I ended up at home around 17:45 without so much as a peep. I called again, and caught Therese in the midst of something very loud. I didn&#8217;t ask if she passed. I didn&#8217;t have to. I knew.<br />
&#8220;So, can I call you &#8216;Doc&#8217; now?&#8221;<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my privilege to present the new Dr. Therese Hollingsworth. (Feels kinda weird to be writing that, I have to say.)<br />
The plan was to meet at Catch at 19:15 (the first time they had a table for five) and celebrate. (Besides, Therese had $50 in gift certificates to spend.) Therese drove over with her friend Joe, Geoff and Deanna would meet us there later. When I arrived, I found Therese alone at the table. It had only been a month and a half since I&#8217;d last seen her, but it felt like a lifetime.<br />
What made it more poignant was that this was a different Therese. This wasn&#8217;t the Therese I had come to know over the last decade. This Therese was happy, relaxed, and for the first time in her life, free of school. And just to complicate things even more (as if finishing her doctorate, moving to Montreal, and buying a home weren&#8217;t enough), Therese is three months&#8217; pregnant. In a few short months, two of my best and closest friends will be parents.<br />
I suddenly feel about 10 years older. (That&#8217;s 28 for those of you keeping count.) I&#8217;m not ready for this level of maturity. I&#8217;m too young for this.<br />
We ate a wonderful dinner and celebrated Therese&#8217;s success. The conversation around dinner naturally stemmed towards Therese&#8217;s pregnancy, sprinkled every so often with the defence and how it had gone and what Therese was going to do with her post-doctorate in Montreal. Life, it seems, rarely stays in place.<br />
I drove Therese to Stefanie&#8217;s that night, where Therese would stay until she leaves for Montreal this afternoon. But this wasn&#8217;t goodbye yet &#8212; there was still much to do. And Friday night would be such an event.<br />
Geoff (I should point out that I&#8217;m not talking about myself in the third person &#8212; this is *another* Geoff) booked the private room at the Blind Monk for Therese&#8217;s &#8220;reception&#8221;. So, after work, Erin and I headed down (after making a quick pit stop at Bernard Callebaut &#8212; Stuart had asked me to pick up some chocolates for Therese), where Therese got to meet Erin for the first time.<br />
The evening was long &#8212; running from about 19:00 to just after midnight. For us, it was tiring. For Therese, it was a marathon. Being on Eastern time, still exhausted from the defence, and pregnancy don&#8217;t really help one&#8217;s stamina. But Therese was among the last to leave.<br />
The next day, later in the afternoon, I picked up Geoff and Therese from the university to go shopping at Chinook. Therese and Geoff were going to visit Jeanine, Dory, and their new baby in Innisfail the next day, and weren&#8217;t about to go up empty-handed. Baby clothes and toys were the order of the day. I even threw in a small blanket with a bunny head sewn in the middle. (It sounds rather morbid, but it is cute.)<br />
Geoff left early, as Therese and I finished shopping. First to Willow Park for wine &#8212; a thank you gift for Therese&#8217;s advisors. Then it was to PetSmart to obtain a gift for Stefanie and Ian, who had put Therese up for a few days. Then it was the long drive back to Stefanie&#8217;s (not counting a side trip for a quick snack). Therese and I talked the whole way. I knew this would be the last time I&#8217;d see Therese for a while.<br />
Leaving her was difficult. I didn&#8217;t see Therese (or Stuart, for that matter) as much as I would have liked while she lived in Calgary. Now she&#8217;s 3,000 kilometres away, and three months&#8217; pregnant. I&#8217;ll not be seeing her again until after her child is born. We both found it hard to left go. Luckily, the dark streets were empty as I drove down the street. I could barely see the road through the tears.<br />
My weekend did not end there, though. Sunday brought around another first for Erin &#8212; not only had she met one of my closest friends (she had met Stuart when he had come out a month ago to ship out the contents of their house), but now she was going to meet my family.<br />
Well, &#8220;clan&#8221;, I guess. Since Mom, Cathy, and Craig live back in Ontario, Erin won&#8217;t meet them until Christmas (or so). But this was a chance for her to meet my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, cousins Jen, Pam, and Darren, Sean (Pam&#8217;s boyfriend), and of course, Nana.<br />
Needless to say, Erin was a little nervous.<br />
Actually, even *I* was a little nervous. I mean, they&#8217;re my family and I love them to death, but it&#8217;s hard to know how things will go. It&#8217;s not that I planned on disaster or anything (I wouldn&#8217;t have brought Erin if I didn&#8217;t think things would go well), but you never really know how well things will go until they happen. Besides, strange things always seem to happen when we go over there for dinner.<br />
Example: Mike announced that he had to pack up three bags of crabs for a co-worker. This suddenly conjured images of three large bags of Snow or Alaskan King, making me wonder what bet Mike had lost. I wasn&#8217;t the only one with this thought, and we soon found out that he had meant crabapples, not seafood. A co-worker wanted to make crabapple jelly. This led Mike, Jen, Sean, Darren, and I outside and quite literally up a tree.<br />
Sadly, many of the apples were going soft (some were outright rotten), but there were still many to be had. The tricky part, though, is getting them off the tree. Rotten apples are a breeze &#8212; just shake the branch. The good ones have a much stronger grip, and have to be picked by hand. Darren climbed a latter. Mike hopped on the fence. I went up the tree itself. (And have all the scratches to prove it.) It must&#8217;ve been quite the sight to see all of us in the denuded tree. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find out when Brenda gets her photos developed.<br />
Dinner, as expected, was outstanding. The food was excellent, and the conversation well matched the repast. But dinner was cut a little short. It seemed Darren and Sean were harbouring a virus, which showed through soon after the meal was complete &#8212; they were fading fast. Dinner was over by 20:00. A little unusual for my family, but not unwelcome &#8212; it gave us plenty of time to drive Nana home, me to drop of Erin (who lives in the deep south of Calgary), and be home in time to get my butt up for gym in the morning.<br />
I now sit, staring out my window, half wishing I could see planes taking off from the airport. I&#8217;d wave to them, knowing eventually Therese&#8217;s plane would be passing over. Instead, I have to wave at the crackheads and hookers who love hanging out in our area.<br />
Have a safe flight, dear friend. Hopefully it won&#8217;t be too long &#8217;til when next we meet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>In years previous, I&#8217;ve spent Thanksgiving with my family. This year, however, I spent it with Erin&#8217;s.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t a spur-of-the-moment thing. In fact, this was loosely planned from the last (and first) time I&#8217;d met Erin&#8217;s parents (see [[Meeting the parents]]). The idea had arisen during the dinner, when (thorough engaged in conversation, not at all affected by the wine we were drinking or by the comradery Erin&#8217;s dad and I felt as we took on Erin in a battle of wits) Erin&#8217;s father had suggested that next time we might stay the night and not have to worry about what we ate or drank.<br />
Thanksgiving was just the next logical opportunity. And with my family out of town, there seemed no reason not to go.<br />
Not there wasn&#8217;t any possible apprehension. Let&#8217;s be realistic here &#8212; I&#8217;m spending over 24 hours with my girlfriend&#8217;s parents (in their home). I&#8217;ve met them from before, so in that respect there&#8217;s no pressure, but this is a slightly different aspect. In my last serious relationship, I spent the night on my first visit. But I slept in a separate bed. Erin and I were destined for the same room, same bed. At times, I almost worry that there&#8217;s *too* much acceptance. If that actually makes any sense&#8230;<br />
We headed out from Calgary late Sunday morning. I love long weekends &#8212; Sundays never seem sad because you don&#8217;t have to go to work the next day. I think I&#8217;ve always disliked Sunday for that reason. (I&#8217;ve never minded long weekend Mondays, though.) The day was cool, but bright, and the trip down to Nanton was fairly speedy &#8230; except for that stretch of Highway 2 just north of High River being repaved.<br />
Dinner preparation was already well underway. The turkey was due to hit the barbecue (yes, not the oven &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how well it works) at 13:00. As Erin and were running a little late, the original plans for lunch had to be altered. While Erin&#8217;s dad stuck around to ensure that the turkey hit the heat on time, Erin, Erin&#8217;s mom, and I went on a little trip to retrieve sustenance.<br />
Nanton&#8217;s a small town. Erin&#8217;s parents live a block away from the &#8220;downtown&#8221; core. (If you drive south from Calgary on Highway 2, you&#8217;ll pass right through downtown Nanton.) You can walk around the downtown in about 20 minutes, I think. About half of the stores are antique shops, there&#8217;s a couple of restaurants, a pub or two, a CIBC, one hotel (near as I can tell, anyway), and a few grain elevators.<br />
Nanton, once upon a time, was a (fairly) major station on CP&#8217;s MacLeod subdivision, when it ran from High River down to Ft. MacLeod. (Assumedly for lack of profitability, the subdivision was closed and the tracks ripped up south of High River between 1998 and 1999.) Today, the rail bed is still very visible, and the grain elevators sit forlorn, no longer in active (rail) use.<br />
Whether or not the disappearance of the railroad has led to Nanton&#8217;s shrinking commercial base (there are a number of closed businesses) is a debatable one. The loss of the railroad has affected other towns in the past (Hanna, Biggar, Melville, Stratford), and some manage to recover through various efforts (such as the Stratford Festival). Nanton, however, seems quite content to be as it is.<br />
The three of us wandered across a somewhat chilly downtown to a small restaurant on Highway 2 north (the highway divides running through Nanton), sitting between the road and the rail bed. While the name of the place completely escapes me, it&#8217;s the only (open) restaurant on that side of the road. There you&#8217;ll find all sorts of homemade-type foods. And without a doubt, possibly the best sandwich I&#8217;ve ever had. (Mind you, the uber-fresh, all-natural bread from a little bakery in High River contributed to that.)<br />
After some discussion, Erin and I went for a walk around town. Specifically, I wanted to see all the antique shops. I think Nanton&#8217;s second-largest industry after agriculture is antiques &#8212; there&#8217;s more stores in two blocks than in most of Calgary, I think. And the prices are actually pretty reasonable (well, except for one place). Most of the items are quite interesting, too, and you don&#8217;t have to spend huge amounts of time filtering through things.<br />
One store in particular is massive. Once upon a time, it was a hardware store on the main level, with apartments in the second floor. Now the entire building is nothing but antiques. Name it &#8212; it&#8217;s probably in there, somewhere. Once upon a time, so I&#8217;m told, the store owners had things laid out very carefully. The apartments were laid out as &#8220;suites&#8221;, with entire collections made out so you could (in theory) buy an entire suite at once. The original owners sold and moved on, and now things are just stacked to the ceiling.<br />
There was only one shop we didn&#8217;t make it into before closing time. But by then, Erin and I didn&#8217;t really care too much &#8212; the whine of Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; fridge and the musty smell of the antiques gave the both of us headaches. We retreated to Erin&#8217;s parents&#8217; home to do something about the pain.<br />
Dinner was the traditional fare for Thanksgiving: turkey, sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, and buns. For most of the day, I managed to keep myself clear of food preparation. But as Erin was mashing potatoes, I felt the urge to suddenly interject.<br />
I have issues with mashed potatoes. I hate them. Well, to be specific, I hate plain mashed potatoes. They&#8217;re boring. They have no flavour, and almost no texture. It bothers me immensely. So when I saw Erin&#8217;s mom bringing out the milk, I suggested a slight modification to the dish: Beer.<br />
Yeah, I know, beer&#8217;s my solution for everything. In this case, it partly is. You want to make really good mashed potatoes? Here&#8217;s what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-6 medium-sized red skin potatoes</li>
<li>1 medium-sized white (or yellow) onion</li>
<li>2-5 cloves of garlic (depending on how strong you like)</li>
<li>1 can Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown (or beer of choice)</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>dried or fresh rosemary</li>
</ul>
<p>Clean, but do not peel, the potatoes (there&#8217;s a lot of flavour in the skin). Cook as you would normally, until ready to mash. While cooking the potatoes, chop the onion and put into a frying pan on medium-low heat. Cover the frying pan with a lid, uncovering only occasionally to stir (you don&#8217;t want anything to burn). This will caramelize the onions. When you&#8217;re ready to start mashing the potatoes, chop and add the garlic to the onions. Mash the potatoes with a hand masher &#8212; it&#8217;s more work, but the texture is better than with a blender. Pour in only as much beer as you need to mash the potatoes. You can go for thick and chunky or &#8220;creamy&#8221;, depending on what you like (I find that just enough beer to take most of the large lumps out is perfect). Add the onion/garlic mixture, sprinkle some rosemary, and mash some more.<br />
Everyone seemed to like them. (Well, why wouldn&#8217;t they?)<br />
I also dabbled in making the gravy, when Erin&#8217;s mom tried to back out of making it by saying there weren&#8217;t enough drippings. (Small children could have swam with all the drippings we had.) I was more than happy to dive in and &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem.<br />
The turkey was completely free-range organic. The farm it came from (Sunworks Farm in Armena, AB) is so eco-friendly that its pamphlet even advertises that it&#8217;s &#8220;predator-friendly&#8221;. It&#8217;s more expensive, to be sure, but I have to say &#8212; you can taste what turkey is *supposed* to taste like. This is a farm I&#8217;m definitely going to have to look into much closer in the future.<br />
Oh. I have to mention the cranberry sauce. (I can hear the &#8220;oohs&#8221; from Cathy and Mom.) I&#8217;ve never liked cranberry sauce. Felt it was just not the sort of thing I would eat with turkey. Well, Erin&#8217;s mom pulled a recipe for &#8220;Gourmet Cranberry Sauce&#8221; from one of the bazillion &#8220;Best of Bridge&#8221; cookbooks. It&#8217;s essentially cranberries (fresh or frozen), oranges, and Gran Marnier. Screw the turkey &#8212; that stuff you can eat on its own.<br />
Even though we were quite full from the first round, we had to partake of dessert &#8212; pumpkin pie. As we briefly congregated in the kitchen to carry out the dessert, Erin&#8217;s mom suddenly thrust a small crystal bowl mostly filled with a transparent green substance.<br />
Lime Jell-o.<br />
Now, there are probably a few people in my family who will laugh at this. The rest of you are probably confused beyond all heck.<br />
What&#8217;s the deal with the lime Jell-o? This stems back to the last time I was in Nanton. I&#8217;d told Erin&#8217;s parents about Christmas (and other family dinners) at my father&#8217;s mother&#8217;s home in Leaside (Toronto). At the time, I&#8217;d hated all the other desserts: pies, some cakes, trifle, etc. So Grandma had always make bowls of Jell-o for me, which I sometimes had to fight over with others.<br />
Erin&#8217;s mom had remembered, and made me a bowl of Jell-o. Erin was thorough confused, apparently having forgotten that conversation. Heck, even *I* hadn&#8217;t realized why Erin&#8217;s mom had made it at first, until I remembered the stories I&#8217;d told the last time I was there.<br />
Needless to say, I like Erin&#8217;s parents.<br />
We had a late harvest Riesling with dessert. By that point, my stomach was crying &#8220;uncle&#8221;, and I spent about 45 minutes trying to put myself in a semi-comfortable position as not to feel too ill. Turkey coma kicked in about an hour later, and I ended up crawling into bed shortly after midnight.<br />
The next morning, it was my turn to cook. (I&#8217;d made this request from when it was suggested that I was coming to Nanton.) I&#8217;d been wanting to make my dad&#8217;s pancakes for years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t had them since Christmas of 2001, and was dying to have them again. So, with Erin&#8217;s family watching, I whipped up a batch of pancake batter, fried up some sausages (Erin&#8217;s mom made some really good bacon), and julienned a couple potatoes for hash browns.<br />
My poor stomach hadn&#8217;t recovered from dinner the night before.<br />
The sausages were thoroughly delightful, not the least of which was because they (like the turkey) were all-natural. Instead of fillers or sweeteners, there were cranberries. I&#8217;m certain the casings weren&#8217;t edible plastic, either.<br />
Having completely ruined my diet for about a month, Erin and I set up to head back to Calgary. Both of us had things to do, and while sticking around was a good thought, we readied to roll. But not without trucking back enough food for a small battalion.<br />
I love leftovers. Especially when it&#8217;s turkey.</p>

		<p>This weekend, I visited southern Ontario. Even though I&#8217;ve only just left, it almost feels like I was never even there.<br />
A few weeks back, Critical Mass announced (to the employees) that it was in the process of pitching a very large client (see [[Friends: Visiting and moving away]]). And no, I still can&#8217;t tell you who it is.<br />
Anyway, at the time, there was the great expectation that I&#8217;d be coming out to Toronto to help interview people and (ultimately) help set up the team in the Toronto office &#8212; assuming that we won the work.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass is growing. We&#8217;re preparing for a (hoped) massive expansion, but also have organic growth to contend with.<br />
This is what led Critical Mass to have to hire a new Project Analyst. And luckily for me, it&#8217;s my friend Graham.<br />
You might remember Graham from a couple train chases, specifically my last hunt of 6060 (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]) and from the Inaugural Run of the CPR Empress (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It&#8217;s because of Graham&#8217;s ex-girlfriend that I met Graham while chasing 2816, because I looked a little lost. Since them, Graham and I have forged an interesting friendship, based mostly around trains.<br />
This means, of course, that I&#8217;m no longer the only train guy in the office. And some people here already know this. When Graham came for his first interview, Claude asked him about his hobbies, which included (of course) chasing trains. They asked if Graham knew me.<br />
Now this is where I got screwed. You see, Graham didn&#8217;t apply for this job because of me. I didn&#8217;t even know about it. Graham applied knowing that I work for Critical Mass. Because he wanted to get in on his own merit, he feined ignorance of me. If I&#8217;d had the chance to recommend him (and I would have), I could have received a $1,000 referral bonus.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Either way, it&#8217;s all good. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see Graham more than I have in the past (which isn&#8217;t that much), but with him on the fourth floor and me on the second, it&#8217;s hard to say how much our paths will cross.<br />
And we have to be a little cautious. If both of us ever called in sick at once, the immediate assumption would be that we&#8217;re chasing trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, I did the one thing that most guys dread when they get into a relationship.<br />
I met the parents.<br />
This was something Erin and I had discussed several times over the last week or so. It sounds like a huge deal, I&#8217;m sure. It means I&#8217;m getting serious &#8212; why would I meet her parents otherwise, right?<br />
Things aren&#8217;t quite *that* serious. In fact, the primary reason I&#8217;m meeting her parents isn&#8217;t because I need to start calling them &#8220;Mom and Dad&#8221;, but because they&#8217;re an important part of Erin&#8217;s life. She sees them almost every weekend, and talks to them almost every day. It&#8217;s the same as introducing Erin to Scott when he was in town.<br />
So, with that in mind, we took off from Calgary late this morning for Nanton, a small town about 45 minutes south of the city. It&#8217;s an easy drive &#8212; Highway 2 runs right through the middle of town, and Erin and I rarely stop talking.<br />
Erin was trying to psyche me out. Although this was important to her, she was trying to have as much fun with it as possible. But despite trying as hard as she could, Erin was more nervous about me meeting her parents than I was. (Of course, it helps to have gone through this before, but on a bigger scale &#8212; see [[Visiting Friends in Calgary, Deciding to Leave Vancouver]].)<br />
Erin&#8217;s parents met us at the door. I presented Erin&#8217;s mom with a bouquet of flowers in thanks for hosting us for the day. (My mother drilled into me the need to make sure that I don&#8217;t show up empty-handed.) Erin&#8217;s dad was quick with a handshake. Within minutes, I had a &#8220;slush&#8221; in hand &#8212; basically, a home-made bellini. (If you don&#8217;t know what a bellini is, just think of it as an alcoholic Slurpee.)<br />
Now this is when you&#8217;d expect 20 Questions. In fact, we ended up starting down a path quite humourous. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Make Fun of Erin&#8221;.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; this is risky business. This is the sort of thing that gets me in big trouble with the significant other. For the record, I didn&#8217;t start this &#8212; Erin&#8217;s dad did. Erin and her father have an odd relationship of constantly badgering each other. I just jumped on the bandwagon when I had the opportunity to get a couple of jabs in. I caught a few &#8220;oooooh, you&#8217;ll get yours&#8221; glares from Erin, but haven&#8217;t (as of yet) received anything in return.<br />
Erin&#8217;s an only child, so is close to her parents. But make no mistakes, Erin is not the spoiled brat one might expect. Erin&#8217;s upbringing was controlled (which led Erin&#8217;s mother at one point to declare &#8220;there&#8217;s only one thing we didn&#8217;t let you do&#8221;, which of course took on the wrong connotation and nearly left me in convulsions). Erin doesn&#8217;t get away with much, especially with her father on her case. (I just tagged along for the ride.)<br />
We had loosely planned to visit for a while and then go look at all the antique stores in Nanton. But soon we were into the Las Vegas photo albums, and Erin&#8217;s dad hauled out their rather impressive collection of Canadian Mint coins. Before we knew it, it was dinner time.<br />
Beef tenderloin, cabbage salad (from which the mushrooms were withheld because someone had told Erin&#8217;s parents that mushrooms and I don&#8217;t get along), cheese bread, baked potatoes, and beans. Far more than I&#8217;d ever expected, and all delicious. We talked almost the entire dinner.<br />
And did I mention the bundt cake? Erin&#8217;s mom made a cake based on her aunt&#8217;s recipe. It comes with a white chocolate glaze that just about sent my blood sugar count through the ceiling. And worth every vibrated tooth.<br />
But before long, it was just past 20:00, and we had to head back to the city. It&#8217;s a 45 minute drive to Erin&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s another 20-30 minutes to my house. I need to make sure I hit the gym tomorrow to try and work some of the dinner off.<br />
We&#8217;ll be back. I&#8217;ve been invited for Thanksgiving. The question is who&#8217;ll be the bigger turkey: me, or the bird.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Just when you think it&#8217;s safe not to worry about having to put out any additional funds for home improvement, the proverbial crap hits the fan.<br />
Or in this case, the sewer line.<br />
For the record, it wasn&#8217;t *my* sewer line. It&#8217;s my neighbours&#8217;. As you might recall from a previous note about my house (see [[Strange Things that Happen while Buying a House]]), the house next door to mine is a mirror image. They were built at the same time, using the same (but reversed) floor plan, and similar construction. In fact, when built, the houses were so similar they even put in the sewer lines at the same time, a scant six inches from each other as they go out to the road.<br />
Yes, you are correct: &#8220;Uh oh&#8221;.<br />
Now to really get things into perspective, you need to understand two things: 1) The sewer lines are original, meaning they were put in place 91 years ago, using materials common to construction 91 years ago. 2) There were a number of trees planted and removed over the last 91 years.<br />
What&#8217;s this mean? Allow me to explain&#8230;<br />
About three weeks ago, I sat on my couch (okay, I was sprawled all over it&#8230;) watching either TV or a movie (can&#8217;t remember which). I noticed a City of Calgary Waterworks Emergency truck pull up in front on my home. The passenger shone his flashlight at the street numbers, hard to see in the late evening light. I became worried when they stopped in front of my home. I suddenly was worried that there was something up with my sewer that I didn&#8217;t know about.<br />
They went to my neighbours&#8217; place. They came back the next day, followed soon after by Roto-Rooter. Finally talking to Neil, I got the scoop: a section of their sewer line, outside of City property (hence, responsibility) was so blocked that Roto-Rooter couldn&#8217;t get through it with their gizmos. Near as the technicians could figure, the pipe had collapsed.<br />
What had caused the pipe to collapse? Well, we&#8217;re not entirely sure about that, but we&#8217;re pretty certain it was the aforementioned trees. Whether it was that blasted poplar that&#8217;s been wreaking havoc, or it was the tree that (until recently) sat above the pipes is anyone&#8217;s guess. But age combined with root taps had done in the wonder of the modern age, and it was time for it to be replaced.<br />
This meant digging. This is when I find out that our two sewer lines are a scant six inches apart, right in the same area as our water lines.<br />
Oh yeah, I was just *loving* this.<br />
I&#8217;m not about to be the kind of assoholic neighbour that&#8217;ll stand up and say: &#8220;Sure, you want to replace the sewer? Go nuts. You can pay for mine while you&#8217;re at it.&#8221; Why? Well, aside knowing that I was likely in the same boat, there&#8217;s a neat little book floating around that has a good piece of advice in it: Love thy neighbour. (I might not be a religious person, but books of faith often have some good common-sense thoughts in them.)<br />
So last Wednesday, bolted home to get started on the dirty work. The lines ran underneath a section of grass shared by the two properties, divided by a fence and a tree. Because this section would be completely dug out, the fence had to go, and the tree had to come down. By the time I got home, Neil and Daryl were already at work.<br />
The front fence at Neil and Daryl&#8217;s place had to come down completely. The section of fence from the property line to my front gate had to come out (thankfully, not the rest). And, of course, the fence down the property line. Above the ground, the fence looked pretty good. But as we dug it out, we realized that the people who&#8217;d put it there had not used treated wood. A few more years, and it would have had to have been replaced, anyway.<br />
The tree was the fun part. None of us had power tools suited to the job. All we did have were handsaws and a length of rope. (The rope was tied off to branches to keep the houses from being hit.) At first, the job was pretty easy. But as we started getting to the larger branches, it became a much harder problem. We sawed and hacked (with a hatchet) through thick branches, and then would all get on the end of the rope to try and pull the branch down.<br />
Across the road, the superintendant of one of the apartment buildings had been watching our progress. He sauntered (slowly) across the road to see how we were doing.<br />
Him: So. (Pause) Looks like you&#8217;re cutting down a tree.<br />
Us: Really? We thought we were putting up a monument to Che Guevara&#8230;<br />
Him: You&#8217;re going about it the wrong way.<br />
Us: Actually, we felt we needed to get back to our Amish roots.<br />
Him: Let me go get you my chainsaw.<br />
Us: You kind, generous, thoughtful man! We are forever in your debt!<br />
So the superintendant sauntered (slowly) back across the road, returning (slowly) with his electric chainsaw. After giving Neil a demonstration of how to use it, we set down to the task of cutting down (and chopping up) the remainder of the tree. Neil and Daryl hauled off the remains to &#8230; well, somewhere, but I never did find out.<br />
Yesterday, the digging started. Roto-Rooter brought in a backhoe, and began the task of uncovering the pipes. Neil was there at the beginning to oversee the work (though he ended up staying the entire day), and called me with updates as things happened.<br />
Teak and I had planned to get together for lunch, but I ended up having to ask him to drive me home so I could see what was going on. The trench was unreal &#8212; roots sprouted out everywhere. It was amazing the sewer pipes were intact at all.<br />
They&#8217;d dug all the way back between the houses. (We&#8217;ll have to replace the concrete pathways next spring.) Neil and Daryl&#8217;s cast-iron house pipe was exposed, but my pipe was still clay. The houses might be identical, but things were definitely not equal under the surface. (An additional five feet of digging still didn&#8217;t find the pipe, but they did find an excellent quality clay pipe to use for a connection.)<br />
While my sewer line hadn&#8217;t yet collapsed, it was just a matter of time. Roots had grown in a tight mass inside my line, and had actually started to grow up the pipes into the house. Before connecting the new sewer pipe (something called &#8220;Schedule 40&#8221; PVC), Roto-Rooter cleaned out all the roots they could. (We did a flush test when Tamara got home, to make sure water was flowing freely.)<br />
By the time I got home, just after 20:40, the work was done. The pipes were in place, the dirt filled back in. It was far from perfect &#8212; the torn-up ground was nothing to look at, and the walkways were a disaster. I&#8217;m actually hoping it snows soon so I don&#8217;t have to look at it. Looks like I&#8217;ve already got some home improvement projects set up for next year&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s another cost I hadn&#8217;t planned (or expected). It&#8217;s another one of those joys of owning a home. (The next owner is gonna have it soooo easy.) On the bright side, it&#8217;s something else I won&#8217;t have to worry about.<br />
As the saying goes, shit happens. But now, it&#8217;ll flow a lot more freely.</p>
