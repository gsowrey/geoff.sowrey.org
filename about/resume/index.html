		<p>In my experience, a leader is never a specialist &#8212; a good leader knows the scope of their department, manages the challenges in conducting business and supporting their services, understands fiscal responsibility and able to plan for future growth, expects change and navigates its course. A good leader also knows that none of this happens without a strong team who can execute the plans, and support an entire organization with competency and pride.</p>
<h2>Talents</h2>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-the-box thinking: helping find non-obvious solutions to unique problems</li>
<li>Technical documentation: manuals, requirements documentation, process documentation</li>
<li>System architecture: specifications from inputs to outputs and all points in-between</li>
<li>Process simplification: finding optimal paths in complex collections</li>
<li>Communication: making the technical comprehensible</li>
</ul>
