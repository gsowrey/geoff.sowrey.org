	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;The goats have been sucked.&#8221;<br />
That was how the Rad Sox season wound up Saturday afternoon. We started off the season with a fairly inspirational rallying cry before each game. However, as our less-than-stellar season progressed, the cry degraded to: &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221;<br />
Why goats? Dunno. It was Amy&#8217;s idea. We found it funny, and it put our games into perspective &#8212; don&#8217;t take it seriously. This was a good thing, considering how bad we usually lose. In our entire season, playoff games included, we stand at 24 games played, and only two wins.<br />
Yes, two.<br />
Why? Well, we were playing in a league with people who were (approximately) our age, unlike the &#8220;Old Sweaty Fat Guys&#8221; league the Sox were in last year. This, naturally, made them better than those in the &#8220;OSFG&#8221; league. We also had a problem of getting our key team members (i.e. the good players) to show up on a regular basis. This is partly the reason we lost all three of our games on Saturday.<br />
Triple headers hurt. Especially if they start at 8:00am. I pulled myself out from under the sheets at 7:07am, and managed to trudge my way into some clothes and get down to the car. Because we had to be at our field at 7:40 (so dictated by our coaches), I wanted to give myself a fair bit of leeway. It took (usually) 30 minutes to drive from Metrotown to Kerrisdale (where Allison used to live), so I figured on about 20 minutes.<br />
Even with a stop at Country Style to grab a dozen doughnuts, I still arrived 10 minutes early. No-one else showed until about 10 minutes later, during which I began to wonder if I was on the correct field. (I was, of course.)<br />
Our first game was against our arch-rivals, the Bladerunners. We don&#8217;t much like them. They&#8217;re really annoying. Their coach uses a kid&#8217;s toy megaphone. It&#8217;s annoying. Their first baseperson starts off every inning with a &#8220;Three up, three down, Bladerunners!&#8221; in a fake gravelly voice. She&#8217;s annoying. And although we creamed them 24-7 the last time we met, we lost by six runs. That was really annoying.<br />
Our game ended at 9:35, which meant we had just under four hours until our next game. It was time for breakfast. I headed downtown to meet the others for our morning meal. In the end, only Jonn and I ate, the others opting to work. (We&#8217;re on tight deadlines &#8212; two of our games are attempting to get out the door.)<br />
I returned to the office following breakfast to wait out the remaining hour or so by playing video games. Not even through my first lap in &#8220;Need for Speed III&#8221;, my phone rang. Allison was looking for her parents.<br />
The Collins&#8217; were coming over for the weekend to go to the PNE &#8230; and watch the Rad Sox lose two softball games. They were supposed to call Allison when they got downtown, before boarding a bus to Oakridge Mall (which is close to the baseball diamonds we were playing at). Allison was concerned that they were lost (even though the Collins&#8217; had travelled through Europe all on their own), and she was going to go find them. Thinking this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea (the Collins were to call our apartment, so I wanted Allison to stay), I offered to go look.<br />
I cut my game short, hopped in my car, and headed out to Oakridge. I parked at the Safeway (the Collins were supposed to be waiting there), and walked inside. No sooner had I reached the entrance to Safeway inside the mall did my phone ring. In fact, I was holding it in my hand, and had already dialled the first four digits of my home phone number. It was Allison. The Collins had called. They were in the food court.<br />
I waited with the Collins while they ate lunch, but had to head out to the ball park before Allison arrived. Even then, Allison and her parents were virtually right behind me, arriving mere minutes after me.<br />
Our second game was up against the Paper Kings. We like them a lot better than the Bladerunners. Very nice people. We had to borrow a player from another team (one of the nice people from the Bladerunners) because we were short a woman &#8212; we have to have at least three on the field at any time. We played a very close game, ultimately losing by only a couple of runs. Barb (our borrowed player) was dying in the field towards the end, desperately in need of a toilet. No sooner was the last out called that she took off across the field towards the washrooms, somehow still managing to cross her legs at the same time.<br />
Our third game was against the Tubeworms. They&#8217;re competitive. Not as bad as #69 on the Rippers (who would win the coveted &#8220;Jerk of the Year&#8221; award, if we had one in our league), but they just creamed us. Well, at least as much as a maximum of 10 runs can be considered a creaming. (League rules have a 10 run lead maximum during playoffs. There are a lot of weird rules in our league.)<br />
We sucked goats. Our last game was the worst of the three. Probably because we were exhausted &#8212; physically, and emotionally. You can only take a beating for so long before you become really frustrated. I know I was frustrated &#8212; my last up to bat of the year was a pop-fly after two horrible fouls. It put me in a pretty rough mood for the rest of the day.<br />
The next day was our trip to the PNE. We wanted to be there for the opening of the gates at 10:30 so we could quickly get into the PNE prize home. Every year since 1934 (not including the war years, when the PNE was used as a training camp and Japanese-Canadian internment centre), the PNE has offered a prize home. This year&#8217;s home is the largest ever offered: 4,189 square feet. It&#8217;s freaking huge. And frankly, not all that exciting. I&#8217;ve seen better. Like last year&#8217;s home. But it had a few design features we took away for use at a later date.<br />
We ventured through the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building, where you can literally buy nearly anything you&#8217;ve seen advertised on TV. It&#8217;s usually packed full of people and really annoying demonstrations offered by people wearing hands-free microphones with solid understanding of the human need to buy useless junk. Okay, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there are useful things in there, but you have to look for them. Like the fudge.<br />
We wandered around a bit, eventually finding ourselves at the Pig Races. We couldn&#8217;t actually see them, however, as there was a tremendous wall of people surrounding the spectacle. We continued on to the Petting Zoo. Mr. Collins looked like a little kid as he got in line.<br />
The Zoo is small &#8212; a gazebo about 30 feet across. Inside are chickens of various breeds, goats (old and young), sheep, donkeys, pigs, rabbits, chicks, ducklings, a couple of llamas, and lots of children. The animals are surprisingly content with people touching them all over.<br />
Following our visit with the kids, we took a short hike through Hastings Park. This is the fate of the PNE. Although the PNE has resided in its current location since 1910, the city of Vancouver is slowly converting it into an actual park. We saw Phase I for the first time this year &#8212; a second of ground that had been dug out for large ponds that had once been part of the midway. Over the next three years, most of the park will be torn up and replaced with trees and grass. The PNE&#8217;s days are numbered.<br />
You may be asking: &#8220;Why?&#8221; Simple answer: There&#8217;s no park on that side of town. More complicated reason: Although the PNE is the largest 4-H event in North America, it&#8217;s agricultural roots are beginning to die away &#8212; it&#8217;s really not the best place to hold these sorts of things anymore. There&#8217;s been talk for years of moving the agricultural events to Abbotsford, and the fair to Delta. At the moment, it&#8217;s only talk. The ultimate fate of the PNE is unknown, since no-one in government seems capable of making up their minds. It&#8217;s possible that in the struggle to sort all this out, the PNE might be brought to a final close.<br />
After lunch, we visited Hastings Racetrack, to watch the horses. I&#8217;d never been to horse racing before. I don&#8217;t have any great desire to go again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s (a little) fascinating to watch, but after two races, you get the general idea. Unless you&#8217;re into the betting aspect of it, there&#8217;s not much pull.<br />
It was then over to the Techni-Cal Superdogs show. We&#8217;d gone to the one last year, and thought it was pretty neat. This years show was, well, I leaned over to Allison just as the lights dimmed and muttered: &#8220;Let the cheese begin.&#8221;<br />
The show was held in the Pacific Coliseum, formerly home to the Vancouver Canucks. It was dubbed &#8220;Hollywoof&#8221;, and featured the &#8220;race to the moon&#8221; &#8212; a doggie obstacle course that pitted one side of the coliseum against the other. My frustration from the day before seeped back in as our side kept losing races.<br />
Sometimes, I think I&#8217;m not cut out for competition sports.<br />
The highlight of the show was a race between a 160-pound Rottweiler and a one-pound ball of fuzz, called Hiccup. The ball of fuzz won. The low point of the show was the introduction of the leader for the blue side (our side of the coliseum) &#8212; Captain Woof. He was described (rather accurately) by the leader of the red side as a &#8220;Village People reject&#8221;.<br />
Following the show, we went to see the Main Gate Theatre show. This was a production about the past 89 years of the PNE. It&#8217;s a musical, performed by four people (two men, two women) who appear to be theatre students. They&#8217;re pretty good actors, and decent singers. One of them looked a little like Gerry, but enough that I knew that it wasn&#8217;t him. Besides, I&#8217;ve heard Gerry sing&#8230; (Just kidding, Ger!)<br />
Then it was a race down to the Pig Races. Mr. Collins and I cut through a few hundred people and managed to save four seats on the bench to watch the races. The track is simplistic, a horseshoe-shaped track with a pool of water and a slide in the middle (this is for the duck races).<br />
Richard runs the thing. He started this many years ago, and spends most of the year touring with pigs and ducks. He told us that every May, he makes the trip from Woods Hole, Arkansas to Manitoba to collect four racing pigs. He then trains them (which he claims ain&#8217;t difficult) and takes them on tour.<br />
Pigs run pretty darn quickly. In fact, the actual race takes about 10 seconds. If that. So in order to make a show out of it, Richard also races ducks. They don&#8217;t race the same distance as the pigs &#8212; they go about a fourth of the distance, then up a ramp and down a slide into a pool of water.<br />
Then the pigs come out. Unlike the ducks, the pigs have names, such as Hammy Fay Bacon (Tammy Fay Bakker). Then the gate opens, they tear around the track, up a ramp at the other end, whip down the front of the cages to a dish containing exactly one mini-donut. That&#8217;s what the pigs race for. Frankly, I could understand that.<br />
I understood that so much that the first thing I did after the race was buy a bag of mini-donuts. They&#8217;re not quite as tasty as the Tiny Tom Donuts at the CNE, but they&#8217;re pretty darn close.<br />
After we pigged out on the mini-donuts, we headed out to get a hat. Bank 1, making a foray into the Canadian credit card market, was offering hats if you signed up for their card. This was when I temporarily lost the Collins&#8217;.<br />
I had to make use of the facilities. I raced in, telling the Collins they could keep going and I would catch up. When I came back out moments later, I couldn&#8217;t see them. So I raced into the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building to find them. I raced around for about ten minutes, somehow managing to miss two of them twice, before spotting Mr. Collins looking for me.<br />
Our PNE visit came to close. I was thankful for that &#8212; the lower half of my body was about ready to fall off. My legs were still reeling from the punishment I&#8217;d dealt them the day before. Allison&#8217;s feet were threatening to go on strike, so it was good timing on a whole.<br />
Undoubtedly, you may be wondering why it&#8217;s been a month since the last Observer&#8217;s Log. I&#8217;ve been busy. Really, really busy. With several major projects on the go at any one time, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of energy to whip one of these off. Not to mention that Allison and I have been laying low since the last weekend of July, to try and cope with the stress.<br />
However, it&#8217;s high time for an update, so I&#8217;m sending one out. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be a bit more frequent from now on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I found out this morning that I&#8217;m worth keeping. Needless to say, this is a big boost to not only my esteem, but also my ego.<br />
What&#8217;s all this stemming from? The Radical restructuring. Today will forever be known as &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221; within the walls here at Radical. Today will be an example of why we hate Disney.<br />
A couple of years ago, Radical negotiated a contract with ESPN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Broadcast Corporation, who happens to be owned by Disney. We were making (and were in the process of making) games for ESPN Digital Games &#8212; a venture between us and ESPN. We had three: Hockey, basketball, and a snowboarding game.<br />
A couple of weeks ago, we got the bad news &#8212; Disney said &#8220;no&#8221;. We weren&#8217;t allowed to try a publish them. TRY. It was like talking to Yoda: &#8220;Do or do not, there is no try.&#8221; Someone (dunno who) believed we were incapable. We had been gearing up for publishing for quite a while (which is why we have an office in San Francisco, and are technically an American company, so investors won&#8217;t be spooked). Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we aren&#8217;t doing jack with ESPN anymore.<br />
Unfortunately, ESPN was our major revenue stream. In other words, we&#8217;re screwed. And that&#8217;s what brought us to today. We&#8217;re closing the San Francisco office. We&#8217;ve released our CEO and CFO (much to the delight of everyone here). But we also had to release about 50 people here. That didn&#8217;t go over so well.<br />
We knew this was coming. We&#8217;ve known for a couple of weeks. It&#8217;s like walking on broken glass around here. You feel like there&#8217;s a sniper ready to take you out at a single command. Okay, *I* felt that way. Most of Pure3D is safe &#8212; they&#8217;re pretty bulletproof. Well, almost all of them.<br />
Greg James and Nenad Ukropina weren&#8217;t. I thought I was a goner, for sure. Resume ready to roll at a moment&#8217;s notice. Not that I wanted to leave, but I needed to be ready to bail if the plane started diving.<br />
Pure3D actually had private meetings to plan our escape, should things go really bad. Tim&#8217;s a Big Guy here &#8212; he knows almost everything. But even he sounded worried. (Either that, or he&#8217;s utter brilliant at getting us to think along safety lines.) We worked out a plan of attack &#8212; five of them, actually, Option A through Option E. These various plans went from things going according to plan, to Pure3D leaving as a team and going somewhere else (this was &#8220;Option D&#8221;, a running joke for several weeks before and after &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221;), to casting off to the four winds.<br />
This morning, we were all called to the lounge for a short meeting. It was a short meeting. It went kinda like this:<br />
Management: Good morning. We&#8217;ll keep this short. We have to release about 50 people so that we can keep the company afloat.<br />
Us: (To ourselves) Oh boy&#8230;<br />
Management: When you return to your desks, some of you will have email. If you do, please return here with your personal effects immediately.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: You will have to turn in your keys and anything else that belongs to Radical. You will then be escorted from the building.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: Thank you.<br />
You could have told us this would happen, and we wouldn&#8217;t have believed you. No way in a million years would we have guessed that this was how they were going to deal with the issue. It almost felt like Nazis had replaced our cool management team overnight with a bunch of assholes.<br />
Tim wasn&#8217;t in a good mood. I don&#8217;t blame him. He didn&#8217;t want to do what had to be done, and I know he didn&#8217;t like what had to be done. Radical did the only thing they could &#8212; remove the people before their anger did anything damaging. It was possible, though nothing seems to have happened &#8230; yet. The day&#8217;s long from over.<br />
Lunch will be an interesing one. I&#8217;m certain there will be talk. Mostly about Option D. We have no idea what&#8217;s going on, or what will happen in the coming days, let alone weeks and months. I think I&#8217;d better keep my parachute ready&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The fallout from the round of layoffs a week and a half ago came to a rather disappointing end &#8212; one of our lead programmers decided he didn&#8217;t want to work for corporate America, and quit. Just as the game he was working on entered the final development stages. I still can&#8217;t believe that the Powers That Be could not see that coming. I suspect that Rory and Ian (the two driving forces of the company) predicted something like this would happen, but the final decision came from the States. Convenient that they don&#8217;t really have anything to do with this office.<br />
Then Marketting (also located in San Francisco) decided to get into the act. Earlier in the week, a couple of press releases got around about the deal Radical has with ESPN (we&#8217;re making video games for them). One of our investors, who writes a column for BC Technology, decided he&#8217;d start spewing out to the entire planet about the neat things we were doing.<br />
Problem: No-one was supposed to know until today.<br />
So Marketting decided they&#8217;d send around a message that pointed us at a rather heavily made-up internal website that warned employees about talking to the press. (They didn&#8217;t mention a thing about boneheaded investors.) That was mildy degrading. Two days later, we received the hard copies. Four-colour print on expensive-feeling paper. One copy for each person. Nice waste of money, especially so close to layoffs, eh?<br />
It turns out that the flyers were approved and printed before the financial crunch, but I still think that the idea to hand them around was extremely poor. Many people in San Francisco wonder if all of Vancouver hates them. I can safely say we don&#8217;t hate all of them &#8230; just selected people.<br />
Onto different things&#8230;<br />
I got out this weekend. I had originally decided to go out and get a haircut. I haven&#8217;t had a haircut in about three months, so it&#8217;s looking a little scraggly. (I don&#8217;t buy into the ol&#8217; &#8220;haircut every four weeks&#8221; baloney &#8212; that&#8217;s a ploy by the hairdressers of the world to make more money. Same applies for showering daily, which is really only needed unless you&#8217;re dirty or you smell bad.)<br />
Didn&#8217;t make it that far. Allison immediately suggested that we could go to White Rock. Having read a little about it, and not having been there yet, I thought it a good idea. So we hopped in my car, and took off in the general direction of the former resort town.<br />
Finding it was another issue. Although I knew approximately where White Rock was, I had no idea exactly how to get there. Neither did Allison, although she had a much better idea of where it was. We drove across the Knight St. bridge, and drove through Richmond. We eventually found ourselves in Delta, trying to find out way into Surrey. (White Rock is at the south end of Surrey.) Once we entered Surrey, I decided that it would be a good idea to get a roadmap. (Hey, I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who drives aimlessly for hours without asking where I&#8217;m going.)<br />
About 45 minutes or so after leaving home, we found the main drag in White Rock. We drove along for a short distance, and pulled into a parking lot at the side of the road. You could tell we were in a tourist trap &#8212; the parking cost a dollar an hour.<br />
We crossed the railway tracks (Burlington Northern runs a line between White Rock&#8217;s building and beach, a left-over from the heady days of being a resort town, I suspect) and walked towards the wharf, about a kilometre away. (We could have parked closer to the wharf, but we didn&#8217;t know exactly where we were.)<br />
Along the way, we ran into the White Rock, from which the town received its name. It&#8217;s a large boulder of white granite, an erratic left over from the days of the glaciers. Since White Rock was founded, the boulder has received a few coats of white paint, usually from the local graduates.<br />
The wharf (pier, boardwalk, whatever you want to call it) extends into Shemiamoo Bay about a half kilometre or so. At the end are a lot of people fishing, but mostly crabbing (throwing in crab cages and attempting to catch dinner).<br />
We wandered back through the town for a while, before I darted back to retrieve the car. (The parking meter was running low, and Allison&#8217;s new shoes weren&#8217;t exactly co-operating with her feet.) When I returned, I was met with a freight train that rolled along the tracks, (presumably) heading towards Vancouver.<br />
We stopped for a quick snack at an ice cream shop, and took a moment to relax somewhat (we had walked quite a while that morning). Having had our fill of White Rock (it doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; White Rock&#8217;s is quite small), we opted to travel further west along the shore.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Point Roberts. If you follow the western shoreline of Delta south, you pass by Tsawwassen, a major ferry terminal, just before you reach the 49th Parallel, and the end of Canada. But right at that point isn&#8217;t the end of the land &#8212; it actually goes just a bit further south, and into the United States.<br />
In 1854, after many years of arguments between the United States and Britain (who held domain on the western side of the Dominion of Canada), the border was extended across the 49th Parallel until it reached the Georgia Strait, where it dipped slightly to accomodate Fort Victoria, at the south end of Vancouver Island. Originally, the Americans had wanted the border to allow them access right up the coast to Alaska (then-President Polk was elected on the slogan &#8220;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&#8221;), but eventually the Americans and the British agreed on the treaty of 1827, setting the border at the 49th Parallel. Because Point Roberts wasn&#8217;t on the oceans, it became cut off from Canada.<br />
But you&#8217;d never know. Pretty much the entire 4.9 square mile peninsula caters to Canadian interests. There are many beach homes (which sell for as little as US$50,000), and the area is almost completely undeveloped. But most amenities are available, and some of the municipal services (water, hospital) come from neighbouring Canada. The grocery stores take Canadian money with no question. And due to the relative tight security (you have to go through a border crossing when entering and exiting Point Roberts), the crime rate is also very low.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long. Just enough to buy some cheap cheese, and fill up on cheap American gas. We thought we might even stay for dinner, but Point Roberts isn&#8217;t exactly known for its good food. We headed home, but ended up in Richmond to eat at Antonio&#8217;s, a tasty pasta bar.<br />
On Sunday, Allison and I made a quick spin of Metrotown, so we could obtain some free shorts, and peruse the haircutting establishments (none of which I was at all thrilled with). I then pretty much resigned myself to cleaning up my apartment. Having acquired some furniture from IKEA earlier in the week, I was determined to try and clean up my apartment a little.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this is my first crack at a proper Branch entry. Hopefully these will go as well as I hope they do&#8230;<br />
My weekend got off to a bit of a rocky start &#8212; my company laid off 12 people in our Vancouver office. The CEO and CFO of our company (both from our San Francisco office) came up to inform us of the situation. The two driving forces of the company, Ian and Rory (the guys, who IMHO are the men behind the curtain) broke the bad news, and the CEO and CFO put the spin on it.<br />
Now I know why I didn&#8217;t like working for Corporate America &#8212; the spin. I hate spin. I like hard, cold, unsugared facts. I have to give Rory and Ian their credit &#8212; they know their staff well. The CEO on the other hand, well, he needs to be here a little more often to understand us, I guess. All I know is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought his presentation was a little too slick.<br />
On Friday, Allison and I decided we&#8217;d head to Nanaimo for the long weekend. Allison had not been home since our last excursion at Easter, and wanted to go home for a short while. I, too, wanted to go, because it would allow me to get out of the city for a brief period of time. (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says &#8212; a change of scenery is a must from time to time.<br />
Allison picked me up at the office just after 12:00 on Friday afternoon. Our first destination was Granville Island, so we could visit the market. Our plan was to bring over all the goodies needed to have a good west coast barbecue.<br />
Following a brief lunch, we looked around at the various shops. We purchased vegetables (asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), fruit (strawberries), bread (sourdough), salmon steaks wild sockeye), and a bottle of a not-too-dry white wine. The whole shebang came out to around $40. (The salmon and wine accounted for most of the cost.)<br />
By the time we left, we found we would be hard-pressed to get to the ferry at Tsawassen in time. So we opted for the Horseshoe Bay ferry. One minor problem: We weren&#8217;t the only ones with that idea.<br />
By the time we got to Burrard, the street was backed up. It took over 10 minutes to crawl a few measly blocks. Georgia was even worse &#8212; traffic was solid for several blocks. But when we finally cleared the entrance to Stanley Park, the flow began to speed up. However, it was already 14:10, and we had to be at the ferry no later than 14:40 &#8230; if we were lucky enough to find parking.<br />
We had not been able to beat the rush to the long weekend, which was clearly evident by the very long lineup for the ferry. It looked like a three or four sailing wait for some people. Since Allison and I were aiming to be walk-ons, we were able to scoot down into Horseshoe Bay to look for a parking lot. Luck shone on us that day &#8212; we got one of the last spots.<br />
Despite some communication problems, we managed to contact Allison&#8217;s parents. They picked us up at the ferry, and we went to the Collins&#8217; for dinner. Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t started to make dinner yet. It was barbecue night.<br />
The next day, Allison and I thought we&#8217;d do some driving. Mrs. Collins suggested Cathedral Grove, which is a rather famous patch of old-growth forest near the very middle of the Island. Mr. Collins thought Coombs would be a nice stop along the way. Mrs. Collins then started to tell Allison about the new interchanges in the area &#8230; then promptly decided that the four of us should go on the trip. I had no objections.<br />
We stopped along the way at Rathtrevor beach, so I could see what a good tidal beach looked like. I don&#8217;t know how far out that beach went, but it looked like a half-kilometre. At high tide, the beach would completely vanish. All I could think was that the beach would be immense fun in the summer.<br />
We proceeded north to Parksville, where we turned onto the Port Alberni Highway, and headed west. Not too far from Parksville, we entered Coombs, a little town in the Island interior. Coombs probably used to be nothing more than a mining or logging town. Today it has a thriving little tourist business, formed around the Coombs market. What&#8217;s so special about the market? It&#8217;s not every day you see a sod roof with real goats parading about.<br />
Soon we entered Cathedral Grove. It&#8217;s a provincial park that was created from land donated by H.R. MacMillian, a forester who founded HR MacMillian (part of MacMillian-Blodel industries, if I&#8217;m not mistaken). Yes, Her-mac (as one call it) is a logging company. Sounds a little weird for a founder of a company that has come under a lot of fire for logging old growth-trees to donate a small forest of old-growth trees for parkland, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, Mr. MacMillan was apparently a nice guy, and wanted the future to know what the past looked like. Public outcry also forwarded the cause.<br />
Cathedral Grove is aptly named &#8212; I have never in my life seen trees so large. But even trees so large are not immune to the environment. On Jan. 1, 1997, there was a tremendous windstorm that tore through the grove. It knocked over several trees and thousands of branches. Several parts of the forest floor were complete littered with timber. But none of it was cleaned out &#8212; the park is to remain almost completely untouched.<br />
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Coombs, to shop at the market, and look around. It&#8217;s a nice little market &#8230; with a few hundred people packed in. But it&#8217;s worth the drive &#8230; at least, I thought it was worth the drive.<br />
We had a late lunch in the restaurant, and wandered through the multitude of wares in the market. (Oddly enough, most of the wares were Mexican &#8230; a little strange, IMHO, considering the Native influences in BC.) I purchased two very large Mexican hand-woven blankets (which are really warm). Allison bought a handful of paper mache vegetables for decoration.<br />
Returning home, we sat down to the task of making dinner. But even then, we didn&#8217;t eat until 20:00 or so. I offered to try and fix Mrs. Collins&#8217; email problems on her computer. She&#8217;d been having problems with the addressbook, and having multiple copies of Netscape floating around.<br />
The next day we rose early to go see the Victoria Day Parade. The Victoria Day Parade is a big thing out here. Few places in Ontario (only Ottawa comes to mind, and apparently Orillia also carries on the tradition) have a formal parade. In Ontario, the Victoria Day Weekend is more commonly known as the &#8220;May Two-Four&#8221; (the weekend was traditionally around May 24th, and a case of 24 beers is known as a &#8220;two-four&#8221;). It&#8217;s essentially the start of the cottage season in Ontario.<br />
We arrived downtown at about 10:40, expecting the parade to start at 11:00 (which was what we were led to believe). However, we noticed that there were still a lot of cars on the parade route, not all the reviewing stands had been completed, and we were the only people standing around. Mr. Collins soon found out that we had come too early &#8212; the parade didn&#8217;t start until 13:00.<br />
So we went wandering down on the waterfront. It was a nice day, albeit a little chilly from the wind. The weekend had brought a small amusement park to the waterfront (where just attractions appear during festive weekends). We had a batch of less-than-satisfactory french fries (they left a horrible taste in my mouth, and neither Allison or I were feeling too good as a result).<br />
At about 12:45, we headed back to the road to see the parade. When we arrived, the crowds that I had been expecting had appeared. Just after 13:00, the first sign of the parade went by &#8212; a fire truck. I had forgotten what community parades were like. It had been so long since my last one.<br />
I found out after the weekend that one of my co-workers, Greg Mayer, had been on the Hungarian Cultural float (it won for best Cultural Presentation, and Best Presentation Overall). We had somehow managed not to see each other.<br />
We had to hurry back to the Collins&#8217; to go to a family barbecue with Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents. We were sidetracked temporarily at home. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and had to lie down for a while before continuing out again.<br />
The barbecue was great &#8212; Mrs. Collins had made a potato salad that was exactly like the one my mother makes. It was like being at home. We ate until there was no food left to eat, and then ate some more. Dessert was a berry mix on a sponge cake, with whipped cream. Very tasty. Mostly considering that until this weekend, I didn&#8217;t eat berries. Things just keep changing&#8230;<br />
After dinner, we went inside where Allison and I watched the last episode of Murphy Brown. It was sad to see such a good show go, but it was a good last episode. Between Murphy Brown and the X-Files (which came on later), we went into the kitchen to make &#8220;stamps&#8221;. These were pieces of paper that you stamped with ink, and then sprinkled a special glitter overtop. Using a heater, you melted the glitter to make the stamp. It was fun. I won a prize.<br />
Then the final episode of the X-Files came on. Well, the final one that was filmed in Vancouver, anyway. (For we Canucks, it might as well be the final one.) I felt bad because I pretty much had the entire family in the living room watching a show that really didn&#8217;t seem to appeal to anyone. It was only a plot-builder for the movie being released this summer.<br />
Following the movie, the Collins and I made a hasty retreat back to the waterfront to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, we were late in arriving, and the fireworks had already started. As a result, we didn&#8217;t get out of the car. On the bright side though, we managed to be the first car out of there, and missed all the traffic. I felt bad again for making everyone miss the start of the fireworks.<br />
I tried to amend for my selfishness by buying coffee (and hot chocolate) and donuts (and muffins) for the Collins on our way back home.<br />
The next day, the weather couldn&#8217;t make up its mind. It was either rainy or somewhat sunny &#8212; there was no comfortable medium. We left late in the afternoon, catching the 16:30 ferry from Departure Bay. For those of you who know the ferry schedule, yes, that is not a standard ferry time. Extra ferries were running to cope with the traffic.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once again, I&#8217;ve left writing too long, and probably forgotten details of the events of my life. So if I forget anything, I apologise in advance&#8230;<br />
A couple of weeks ago, I decided it was high time that I started taking matters in my own hand &#8230; namely, I needed some exercise. I wasn&#8217;t getting out enough, and I was really afraid that I&#8217;d lose my figure. So it was time to start biking.<br />
My goal was to bike to and from work every day, rain or shine. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the only person &#8212; a good portion of Vancouverites engage in such activity, and it&#8217;s so popular at Radical, that we even have a dedicated bike storage room. (And having showers available certainly entices one all the more.)<br />
Some of you may remember that I made such a boast last year, when I said I would bike from Oakville to Toronto every day. Poor pathetic me didn&#8217;t realise just how far away Toronto was. I biked once, then left my bike there for about two months before bringing it home.<br />
But I said things would be different this time. So one evening, I ventured down to the locker room, pulled out my bike, and straightened out the handlebars (they were turned sideways when it was shipped out).<br />
The following morning, I make my first attempt to bike to work. I went across Grange to where it connected with Kingsway, briefly over to Boundary, and then proceeded north on Boundary to Adanac, which was the bikeway. It took me at least 15 minutes to get to Adanac.<br />
Despite the fact that a large portion of the trip to Adanac was downhill, I was wiped by the time I got there. I couldn&#8217;t believe how out of shape I was. And I still had to cross the city of Vancouver. I proceeded along Adanac, and felt ill to my stomach&#8230;<br />
The only bright point was that I had a shower waiting for me. And I really needed it too! When I went home that night, I went by MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop) to buy a new backpack. The one I have is for hiking, and is completely ill-suited for the purposes of biking. Similarly, my nylon briefcase is painful to wear for that length of time.<br />
When I resumed my riding the next morning, I found a new expression of pain in the saddlesores I had acquired. One does not get a full appreciation of how hilly it is here until one has to bike it.<br />
However, I persevered, to the point where I dragged Allison out on the Saturday for a bike ride around Stanley Park. Oh wow&#8230; I knew that Stanley Park was nice, but I didn&#8217;t think it was *that* nice. For all the reasons that I hated leaving Ontario, the ability to bike around Stanley Park outweighs a large chunk of them.<br />
That night, we went out with one of Allison&#8217;s friends (Rhona-Mae), who was leaving for home (High River, AB) the following day. We went to the Blarney Stone, where we wanted to throttle the doorman for not letting us in for almost an hour. Stupid nightclub politics&#8230;<br />
The following week was Hell Week for me &#8212; my group was putting out a new version of our 3D rendering system, and I had a lot of stuff to document. It was not a nice week at all. This culminated in a couple of nights where I got very little sleep. In one night, I slept about an hour. The next night I ended up sleeping at the office because I was behind in my deadlines.<br />
Allison and I are looking forward to the weekend. Unlike the infamous May Two-Four weekend in Ontario, we just have various festivals. We&#8217;re going to Nanaimo for the weekend, and a slew of barbecues. Ought to be fun&#8230;<br />
Yesterday, my work got flipped on its ear for a little while. I was happily working away, when I received a phone call. At first, I thought it was going to be Allison (we were planning to go see a movie). It was a familiar voice. My father&#8217;s.<br />
Immediately my brain began to have the following conversation:<br />
Left: It&#8217;s dad.<br />
Right: So?<br />
Left: Why would he be calling me?<br />
Right: Hmm&#8230; something important, no doubt. He doesn&#8217;t call otherwise.<br />
Left: He doesn&#8217;t sound upset.<br />
Right: True. Must be something else.<br />
Left: You don&#8217;t suppose&#8230;<br />
Right: Suppose what?<br />
Left: That he&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;in Vancouver?<br />
Left: Oh&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;S**t!<br />
Sure enough, dear ol&#8217; dad had appeared in Vancouver. Why? Because he decided to drive out. Confused? Good, &#8216;cuz I still am&#8230;<br />
You see, when I moved out here, I didn&#8217;t bring my car. I figured I would have it brought out when the time was right. I hadn&#8217;t needed it, so as far as I was concerned, it was a moot point. But my father had wanted to bring it out, dragging my poor mother along for the ride.<br />
So I started talking with my friend Joe, who was living in Toronto, and looking for a new job. I figured he&#8217;d be the perfect person to take my car for a ride. So I started into negotiations, prodding him, bribing him, all sorts of devious under-handed things to get him to drive my car here.<br />
And then my dad shows up with it. At least he didn&#8217;t bring my mother. She was safe at home.<br />
So needless to say, my evening went down the drain rapidly. On the bright side, my father, Allison, and I went out to dinner at the Yaletown Brewery. I figured he could use a couple of beers after the trip out. After that, I drove Allison home, and dad crashed in my bed.<br />
I stayed up to try and find him passage back home. Most of the major airlines wanted at least $1200 for a last-minute one-way ticket. This sort of thing really bothers me. If I call two weeks in advance, it&#8217;s $400. Why should the price rise so much? Lousy capitalism&#8230;<br />
This morning I woke up bright and early at 06:55 &#8230; an hour before I planned to get up. It seemed that dad thought I had to get up at that time. I guess my repeated suggestions that Vancouver time differs quite a bit from Toronto time had gone unnoticed. (I don&#8217;t normally get up until around 08:00.)<br />
My mother called a scant five moments later to tell me that Canada 3000 had deals on their airfare. I had to remind my mom that I wasn&#8217;t in Saskatchewan, and that BC is *three* hours behind, not *two*. (It wasn&#8217;t the first time that she had done that to me.) I made a quick arrangement and booked the flight.<br />
The three of us went out to dinner again, but this time to the Pink Pearl, a Chinese restaurant downtown. It wasn&#8217;t anything to wow about, but at least the food was good. I was a little annoyed at the price, though. I didn&#8217;t think the place would cost so much (it came out to just over $20 a person).<br />
Tomorrow, we dump dear ol&#8217; dad at the airport so he can wing his way back to Toronto. Allison and I are off to Nanaimo on Friday afternoon (I think). I hope everyone has a good weekend, and I&#8217;ll let you know what happened with mine!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First and foremost, I apologise for not writing sooner. It&#8217;s been over a month since my last message, and I can safely say that in those four weeks, I&#8217;ve been so busy that I can group my life into three categories: Work, spending time with Allison, and sleeping. Those of you who know me can probably guess where the majority of my time was spent. (For those of you who don&#8217;t, the list is in order of time spent.)<br />
This means that I&#8217;ve had little time for the basic things, like shopping for food and laundry. Needless to say, email fell quite sharply in priority. But with things winding down (at least a little), I&#8217;m finding the time to write.<br />
What has kept me so busy? Well, if you&#8217;ll remember from one of my last messages, I was hired by Radical Entertainment (<a href="http://www.radical.ca/">www.radical.ca</a> &#8212; yes, the website&#8217;s pretty blaise, but apparently we&#8217;re working on it) as a technical writer. For those of you who missed it the first time, Radical makes video games.<br />
You&#8217;d think that working for a video game company means I play video games all day. Well, you&#8217;d be pretty much correct &#8230; at least when there&#8217;s a good Quake 2 deathmatch, or someone starts a game of Worms 2. And then there&#8217;s the previews of our own games, not to mention the zillions of demos we go through in a week &#8230; bla bla bla. Sounds pretty dull, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
The week after I started, Tim (I seem to be cursed with bosses named &#8216;Tim&#8217;) gave me first big assignment: get the documentation ready for the next software release &#8230; two weeks later.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t sound too bad, does it? Well, allow me to provide some details. The team I work in is called &#8220;Pure3D&#8221;, and they&#8217;re the rendering gurus of the company. They write all the functions and libraries that all the game teams use to make video games. This means that I had to learn everything there was to know about computer graphics in a very short span of time. I also had to learn what all the software did, how to use it, and how to use the existing documentation format.<br />
Needless to say, the documentation didn&#8217;t meet with my satisfaction. The fact was, I simply didn&#8217;t have the time to do the job I wanted to do. Another month and a half, and I might have been able to straighten the whole thing out.<br />
Almost immediately following, I got drafted to do the Scientific Research and Experimental Development report so we could get a chunk of money back from the Feds. I had done one last year for Arkipelago, so I was familiar with the report. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for the sheer amount of work that Radical does in a year. The document stands at over 100 pages, and I&#8217;m still not done editing it.<br />
That has been the majority of my time for the past little while. It&#8217;s rather draining, but it&#8217;s also a lot of fun. And I know I&#8217;m getting satisfaction from the job. So all in all, I have nothing to complain about.<br />
All this means that I haven&#8217;t been getting out of Vancouver much. I didn&#8217;t even really do anything fun until last weekend, when Allison and I decided we&#8217;d look into (everyone brace yourselves for this) condos.<br />
Yes, condos. Glorified apartments. Condos are the most cost-effective real estate in the lower mainland &#8230; unless you&#8217;re rich and can afford the housing out here. Mind you, even after Allison and I looked around, we weren&#8217;t too impressed with the condos out here.<br />
In fact, we were so unimpressed, that we came to the conclusion that there was only one place we could live &#8212; Calgary. Vancouver&#8217;s too expensive, and Allison doesn&#8217;t like the suburbs. (Frankly, I agree with her.) So when it comes time for us to settle down, we have to leave.<br />
We did some calculations, and we found that no matter how we looked at it, living in Vancouver (condo or not) just wasn&#8217;t worth the money. We make sure of our ideas by popping onto a real estate database (www.mls.com) to see what we could find in Calgary. (If anyone&#8217;s interested, there&#8217;s some really nice properties in Banff for less than $200k.)<br />
Since then, we&#8217;ve also started considering Victoria. The only reason we&#8217;re a little apprehensive about Victoria is that it&#8217;s &#8230; well, quiet. Very quiet. Disturbingly quiet. It&#8217;s for the Just Wed and Nearly Dead, so I hear. Certainly feels that way too.<br />
We started looking ahead to vacations. We think we&#8217;re going to take two one-week vacations and explore the coasts of the US &#8212; east in late August, and west in late fall. But then again, we may go to Hawaii&#8230; We&#8217;re still thinking. There&#8217;s also Prince Albert National Park, where I can see my relatives, but that&#8217;s just a thought at this point&#8230;</p>
