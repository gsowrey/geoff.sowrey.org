<p>A decade ago right now, Mommy and I were preparing to go to Foothills Medical Centre. There, Mommy would have a caesarian section and you would be pulled forth into this world &#8212; <em>not of woman borne!</em> &#8212; with your arm draped around your neck like a feather boa, safe and sound. </p>



<p>Well, mostly. That whole anti-K thing and all, as we remind you of every now and then. Which is almost a bizarre parallel to today: almost immediately after you were born, the doctors wanted to whisk you away to the NICU to ensure that the anti-K situation wasn&#8217;t affecting your health. You were isolated. </p>



<p>Ten years later, you&#8217;re isolated again. This time, none of our doing (biological or otherwise), but because of COVID-19. You&#8217;re spending your birthday apart from nearly everyone but your family. </p>

		<p>I blinked, and 2013 kind of vanished on me. It&#8217;s a blur, a seemingly endless stream of activity that rarely relented long enough for me to appreciate any of it. I have pictures to prove it, sure, but I have to struggle sometimes to remember the date, or what else might have happened.<br />
I&#8217;m fairly certain this isn&#8217;t (solely) a result of age. It&#8217;s parenthood. It&#8217;s a rigorous schedule that keeps the family machine moving at quite a pace. Between work schedules (which alternate such that Alex and I resemble &#8220;ships passing in the night&#8221;), school schedules, various after school activities, and the family activities, there&#8217;s very little time for much else.<br />
Like, say, writing a blog.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For me, 2012 was a bad year. Between a host of medical issues (brutal chest cough that led to pulled muscles, to appendicitis, to strep throat, a couple nasty colds-cum-killer flus, and a minor outpatient surgery), ridiculous amounts of stress, the ever-present struggle of being a parent to young children, a general malaise, and an unfulfilled burning need to travel, it&#8217;s truly a wonder I got out of bed in the morning.<br />
So it wasn&#8217;t with any reservation that 2012 walked out of my life on Monday night, yet it still managed to leave me rather depressed. Sadly, 2013 woke me up looking already a lot like 2012, so I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m able to look at this new year with much hope yet. Instead, I suppose I shall have to try harder to make things work more my way.<br />
This not to say that I &#8220;didn&#8217;t like&#8221; 2012. It&#8217;s hard not to like an entire year in one&#8217;s life, especially one that brings so many new things to learn and experience. I just wish it hadn&#8217;t been so darned painful&#8230;<br />

		<p>Well, kids, this vacation is certainly having some ups and downs. I&#8217;m taking that as a good thing, by the way, since without variation things can get a little dry. That&#8217;s also a joke, incidentally &#8212; &#8220;dry&#8221; isn&#8217;t a concern around here. It&#8217;s rained every day so far (we have thunderstorms as I&#8217;m writing this), and not far away, flooding is so bad that highways are being washed out.<br />

		<p>Yesterday morning, I woke up unusually hungry. I honestly can&#8217;t think of the last time I actually woke up hungry. Also dead tired, but that&#8217;s another matter. Breakfast was small, one egg and coffee, which I hoped would be enough.<br />
By 9:30, though, the pains were back, and I tried to eat again. Nothing fancy, just a rice cake with some peanut butter. It only kind of worked. A half hour later, hunger had turned to real pain.<br />
Things only went downhill from there.<br />

		<p>I like long years. Really. Yes, I complain about when things seem to drag out far longer than they should, or if I&#8217;m busting my arse far harder than I think I should. That&#8217;s part of being human, no? In the end, though, I like long years because I get to look back and not worry about how quickly time has flown by. Time should never fly by quickly &#8212; it means I&#8217;ve missed something, and &#8230; well, darn it, I just hate missing things!<br />
This last year was a big one for me in one major way: it was a redefinition of my professional existence. Since the end of 2009, I&#8217;ve transformed from a professional manager to a &#8230; hmm &#8230; well, my title (however formal it needs to be) is &#8220;Solutions Lead&#8221;, but that belies a lot of what I do every day, and just using &#8220;web developer&#8221; or &#8220;programmer&#8221; &#8212; even with a &#8220;Senior&#8221; prefix &#8212; completely understates the reality. This year was really about taking all the skills and knowledge I&#8217;d acquired as a leader, and merging that back into my day-to-day development practices.<br />
And that, as the saying goes, was only the tip of the iceberg&#8230;<br />

		<p>Let&#8217;s pick up where we left off, dear reader. As you already know, I came home in a fair amount of discomfort. Thankfully, I also came home drugged up and bearing a temporary stash of drugs to maintain the druggy state. They delivered in their promised one-two punch: lessening of pain, and increasing drowsiness.<br />
I should point out that until Friday, I had not really known pain. My previous experiences had been limited to bonks of the head (one of which has left a noticeable scar) plus a few nasty scrapes. And with one exception (which led to stitches in my nose), every injury was resolved with a simple bandage.<br />
Now I understand why &#8220;keeping up on your meds&#8221; is so key during recovery.<br />

It wasn&#8217;t a procedure that I was particularly looking forward to &#8212; the thought of surgery was more than a little frightening &#8212; but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be glad to have had.<br />

		<p>As little as a hundred years ago, North Americans lived (generally) in towns and (much smaller) cities, where it was possible to know your elected representatives personally, meet with them, and have a person-to-person chat. In the years following, our representatives have been accused more and more of being &#8220;disconnected&#8221; and &#8220;out of touch&#8221; from their constituents, as the towns and cities grow, and the number of people in a given district rise well past the point of &#8220;manageable&#8221; by a single person.<br />
The biggest problem is not really the number of people &#8212; it&#8217;s the time councillors need to connect with them all, while still doing the job for which they were elected. In a physical sense, it&#8217;s nearly impossible. Some have turned to the internet to help bridge the gap, using technology to connect.<br />
Allow me to show you an example, which I experienced today&#8230;<br />

		<p>Back in August, <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2010/08/living-with-a-hernia/">I was diagnosed as having a direct inguinal hernia</a>. While not particularly serious (right now), it is periodically uncomfortable &#8212; especially with a groin-level child who doesn&#8217;t realise that hitting in the groin area can be painful with such an affliction (let alone the hits to the family jewels).<br />
I was told at the time that it could &#8220;take a year&#8221; until I could get it fixed, but if I was willing to do things more ad hoc, they&#8217;d put me on a call list. On the call list I went &#8230; and I waited. I finally got called about a month ago, which put me in surgery on 17 March &#8212; the day before Choo Choo&#8217;s 1st birthday. Recovering from surgery on such an important day was simply something I wasn&#8217;t willing to do, so I passed. Last week, they called again.<br />
On 15 April, I&#8217;ll get to experience surgery for the first time, ever. And I gotta tell ya, I&#8217;m more than a bit apprehensive.<br />

		<p>When I was about 12 years old, my eye doctor told me that I&#8217;d need glasses one day, but not until I was 40. When you&#8217;re 12 years old, you can&#8217;t comprehend 40 &#8212; heck, it&#8217;s hard to comprehend 13. Still, it was something that always stuck in the back of my head as reality &#8212; one day, I&#8217;d need glasses.<br />
Then, last year, I found out that <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2010/05/look-into-my-eye/">I needed frickin&#8217; lasers shot into my frickin&#8217; eyes</a>. At the time the diagnosis was made, it was already apparent that age was catching up to me, and that my vision &#8212; compounded from nearly 30 years in front of a computer monitor &#8212; was finally beginning to lose its finesse. But I stayed in denial, and stuck to my &#8220;when I&#8217;m 40&#8221; belief, and marched on with life.<br />
That was until this year. The time has come.<br />

<p>A couple of months ago (could be longer, but let&#8217;s start there), I noticed a rather odd bulge just to the left of my [CENSORED FOR PUBLIC DECENCY]. At the time, I wasn&#8217;t too concerned &#8212; it didn&#8217;t hurt, and prodding it seemed no different than the other side. Given my new exercise regiment, I merely assumed it was a result of over-exertion. (As a side note, I&#8217;m probably still correct on that point.)<br />
Yesterday, while having a shower, I happened to notice that it looked bigger than before. Alex, my personal medical encyclopedia, looked at it and said: &#8220;hernia&#8221;.<br />

		<p>A little over four months ago, Alex dragged us all out to see an eye doctor. It had been a couple of years since my last visit, so there was a pretty darn good reason to go back and visit. Not that I particularly wanted to go &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a phobia of anything touching my eye, and eye doctors have a bit of a tendency to do just that.<br />
At the end of the appointment, the doctor told me she suspected I might have something called &#8220;narrow angles&#8221;, and sent me to an ophthamologist. It took nearly two months to get into see him. <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2010/05/look-into-my-eye/">That was an awkward appointment, and ended up with the news that I needed surgery.</a> Which I got, today, on my birthday. Laser surgery. <em>In my eye.</em><br />
Ow.<br />

		<p>A couple of months ago, Alex arranged for all of us (herself, Monkey, and yours truly) to visit the eye doctor for a checkup. It&#8217;d been a couple of years since my last run, and <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2009/07/im-not-old/">given my age</a> it was a wise idea. (I would love to know if there&#8217;s ever been a study on whether married men have better overall health, since their wives are usually the ones scheduling their appointments. Bachelors/single guys, take note!) Not that I particularly like the idea of anyone getting too close to my eyes&#8230;<br />
The results were pretty much what I expected: I need glasses. Well, not need, but should probably get for reading and night time. And even then, it&#8217;s only a recommendation and not mandatory &#8212; I still see (more or less) fine, though there is a wee bit of blurriness. Dr. Amy (my first eye doctor) told me I&#8217;d need glasses when I was 40, and darn it I&#8217;m going to wait until I&#8217;m 40!<br />
But then there&#8217;s the glaucoma&#8230;<br />

		<p>Once upon a time, I had it. &#8220;It&#8221; being my state of fitness. Back in early 2003,<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/02/ymca-starting-exercise/"> my friend Arthur put me on an exercise and diet regimen</a>. Over the course of a few months, I shed something like 30 pounds of flab, and gained at least 10 in muscle. (I surmise that by the slimness, combined with only a 20 lb difference on the scale.) Back then, I was in the best fitness I&#8217;d been in for years. Probably in my life.<br />
So, here I am, a scant seven years later, probably at the opposite end of the scale. No, I haven&#8217;t ballooned out to slovenly proportions, but I&#8217;m definitely not where I was by the end of 2003. I&#8217;m far, far from it. How do I know this? Because I biked today, for the first time in (what Alex figures) is about three years.<br />
All I gotta say is: <em>Holy crap</em>, I&#8217;m outta shape.<br />

Well, add to that a very sick and very pregnant wife, and a sick toddler (which I suspect led to Alex and I becoming ill), and you&#8217;ve got a pretty miserable household. This is all part of parenthood and families &#8212; one goes down, chances are the rest are going down too. (How my parents managed to never seemed to be ill when I was a kid is beyond me.) But it also tends to cause problems when you&#8217;re supposed to go places. Like, say, a baby shower.<br />

		<p>Yesterday, we went in for our now-weekly anti-K checkup. The process is fairly simple: toss the Monkey at some poor, unsuspecting friend to keep her out of our hair for the hour-or-so long appointment, truck over to the EFW in the TRW building at FMC (gotta love them acronyms, eh?), have a sonographer scan Alex&#8217;s belly, and talk to a doctor afterwards to get the run-down on the details.<br />
Or rather, that&#8217;s how simple the process should be. But as we&#8217;re finding, things rarely seem to go the way we want them to. In fact, as of yesterday, we&#8217;re pretty much at the opposite end of the spectrum of &#8220;wants&#8221;. All of this is because of a &#8220;new&#8221; finding that almost displaces <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2010/02/dealing-with-kell-antigens/">the anti-K issue</a> as being an issue.<br />

It was an early morning, and getting everyone up and rolling within an hour set a new Olympic record in the Getting Monkey Up, Dressed, Fed, and Out Of The House  event.<br />
While Monkey went to hang out with our friend Rebecca, Alex and I headed back over to EFW for her appointment, and for the news on Choo Choo&#8217;s progress. Although it&#8217;s been only five days since our last appointment, there was hope that there would also be improvement.<br />

		<p>Two weeks ago, I was sitting at my desk at work, plugging away on requirements documentation. It&#8217;s rather mind-numbing at times, but is often very helpful for the rest of the team. My phone rang. It was my wife, Alex. Normally, she just text-messages me. Actual phone calls are left for things that are important and need immediate discussion.<br />
Alex didn&#8217;t sound her usual cheerful self. In fact, the tone of her voice that worried me almost immediately. She asked me: &#8220;Look up &#8216;anti-k&#8217;. What does it mean?&#8221; Google quickly plunged me into Wikipedia and a raft of pages filled with partial information and incomplete answers. &#8220;You need to get a blood test right away! We need to know if you&#8217;re K+.&#8221;<br />

		<p>I&#8217;ve had some interesting Boxing Days in my past, but perhaps today will rank as one of the strangest.<br />
This morning, we woke up when The Monkey &#8212; who has become very adept at waking up before Mommy and Daddy &#8212; came marching into our room somewhere around 7:00. We all lollygagged before getting up.<br />
That&#8217;s when I knew something was wrong. The room was spinning.<br />

		<p>Well, Monkey, the last week&#8217;s been quite the slog. Last Saturday, you started showing signs of being sick, having caught something from one of your schoolmates. It basically turned you into a bonafide snot factory. (One upside: you&#8217;ve learned how to wipe your own nose. Now if we can just figure out how to make you blow it, too.)<br />
The bug hit me next, kicking in on Tuesday, and then taking me down on Thursday and half of Friday (I didn&#8217;t sleep at all Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday nights, partly due to your coughing and partly due to feeling so crappy.) Mommy caught it next, and her illness really kicked in on Friday, and is just coming out of her illness today.<br />
The group of us effectively played &#8220;Sick Family Robinson&#8221;, holing up and trying to keep our wits, all the while trying not to spread the sickness to Grandma.<br />

		<p>This weekend past was not one of your healthier ones, Mi Pequeña Niña. On Saturday, we noticed your nose was running, and you were coughing again. We&#8217;ve almost come to expect this since you started going to school a few months ago. Until then, you were the picture of health, barely having the sniffles from teething.<br />
Since going to school, you&#8217;ve had a variety of illnesses, coupled with ear infections and your final teeth coming in (you&#8217;ve got all your baby teeth now), and it&#8217;s been a bit of a challenge for you and Mommy. You&#8217;ve seen the doctor a few times, now.<br />
But you gave Mommy and I a bit of a scare last night.<br />

		<p>Yesterday, Mi Pequeña Niña was sick. Not the sniffly, sneezy, coughy kind of sick (she has yet to get a cold [insert sound of me knocking on wood here]) &#8212; but the worse kind of sick. Things coming back up kind of sick.  <br />
The three of us (Janice is also down for a visit, which was already a very welcomed event, but became a significant blessing with her presence) tried to figure it out yesterday evening. What had MPN ingested? Was it something more serious? Did we need to go to a hospital?  <br />
These are the things that all new parents have to go through at some point, until they begin to understand the physical attributes of their children: allergies (if any; so far, so good on our end), what might make them sick, how well they recover from illness, how they handle warm and cold, and so forth.  <br />

		<p>As you might have seen on my Tweets this morning, I&#8217;m alive in Costa Rica. But I&#8217;m not &#8220;well&#8221;. My daughter gave me a parting gift &#8212; a nasty head cold. Fortunately, it didn&#8217;t kick in until I arrived here, otherwise flying would have been utter hell. Such as it is, my head is stuffed with a pound or two of mucus, which is pouring out of a couple of orifices. Kept me up most of the night. Oy.<br />
I had a better experience than Jason or Mark. Jason arrived at the airport on my flight last night only to find his bags didn&#8217;t arrive with him. Mark&#8217;s connection had issues, and got stuck in O&#8217;Hare. I had an email from him at 3:20 this morning, with a 5:45 departure. The bags and Mark should arrive just after 12:30 today.<br />
Jason and I met with Javier this morning. Good news on the office front &#8212; we have a space to work in for the next month and a half, and we&#8217;ve started to acquire materials to construct the new office. I&#8217;m not going to go into details on those just yet &#8212; there are some things you really have to see to believe.<br />
For now, Jason and I are cooped up in our hotel rooms (Jason&#8217;s likely to be here another night) until we can head out to get all of our paperwork signed for the condos. More than likely, Mark will be here and come with us at the time. With luck, I&#8217;ll be in my condo this evening, and the cat will finally have reign to run around a bit.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A year ago, I got married. Something that until a couple of years ago, I never thought I&#8217;d do. I&#8217;d been bitten hard, and I couldn&#8217;t do it. Couldn&#8217;t even imagine it. It takes the right person, and the right situation, to make something like marriage seem feasible, even exciting. And until a couple of years ago, I don&#8217;t think I was even mentally ready for it. It&#8217;s a big commitment, one that many people don&#8217;t really appreciate. It&#8217;s just a &#8220;thing to do&#8221;. Witness the divorce rate&#8230;<br />
Today is the first anniversary. We&#8217;ll be going to Mozart in the Mountain, the first concert of the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra&#8217;s season. (Obviously, I&#8217;m writing this entry in advance.) I&#8217;m also arranging a night at the Banff Springs Hotel as a sort of celebration. Hopefully it all goes well. But this entry isn&#8217;t about this year&#8217;s anniversary. I want to tell you a story about my wedding, and how things don&#8217;t always go as planned. To set the stage, I give you two words:<br />
Food poisoning.<br />
This all started on the Tuesday before, 23 August 2005. Exactly how, I can&#8217;t tell you. Not because I don&#8217;t want to, but because I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ve talked about this endlessly trying to figure out exactly what happened. All I do know is that I ingested <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter">Campylobacter jejuni</a></em>, a rather nasty gut bug that takes a few days to incubate and do its thing. There are a couple of possibilities, but nothing that I would consider conclusive. When when you&#8217;re &#8220;best friend&#8221; happens to be Murphy, you know that it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; you were going to get it anyway.<br />
Skip ahead to Friday, the 26th. My friends Stuart and Therese were in town for the wedding with their daughter, and we&#8217;d all gone out to Chilliwack to have dinner with my family at a cabin they&#8217;d rented. Clams, mussels, and steak. At the time, we were waiting for news of Teak picking Chris up from the airport (having flown in from Japan) and we would all meet at the Mission Best Western, where Therese and Stuart were staying.<br />
It took a while for Chris and Teak to get back. Teak took a few wrong turns in Vancouver (which is very easy if you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going) and they ended up having to stop for dinner along the way. Stuart and I ended up waiting in the hotel&#8217;s restaurant/bar (Therese baby-sat, under the intention of swapping with Stuart once Chris arrived).<br />
Around 23:15, I decided it might be necessary to go to the bathroom. I&#8217;d only had 1/2 of a bottle of beer, though plenty other liquids (I had a bit of a headache, but nothing I&#8217;d consider bad). When I stood up, I knew something was wrong. There was that twinge of nausea that suggested something was amiss, and I <em>really</em> needed to go to the bathroom.<br />
When Chris and Teak finally arrived just after midnight, my head was swimming. I couldn&#8217;t see straight without a lot of effort. There was no way I was going back to Chilliwack that evening (I was supposed to stay with my family). I begged Teak and Chris to crash in their hotel room. I managed to (somehow) drive back to their place in Maple Ridge (about 20 minutes) without causing an accident. I pulled out my sleeping back, curled up on the floor, and proceeded to suffer a tired, awkward, sweaty, and painful half-sleep until my alarm went off at 7:00 the next morning.<br />
By that point, I&#8217;d made a few trips to the bathroom. None of them were to vomit, thankfully, but every trip just reinforced that something was wrong. Teak&#8217;s Advil didn&#8217;t bring much relief. The pressure of the things that needed to be done before 13:00 however, allowed me to concentrate on other things. That, and a stop to the 7-11 along the way to pick up Gatorade seemed to help a bit.<br />
While Alex was getting her hair done (I hadn&#8217;t seen her since early-afternoon the day before), I ran around setting up tables, arranging placements, getting chairs into their locations. Teak and Chris had graciously loaned me their time to help decorating, though we didn&#8217;t really need a lot of it. Mostly just to hide the rather unattractive corners of the tent.<br />
An early-morning call to the bakery had discovered that our order for cupcakes would be ready for 15:00 &#8230; two hours <em>after</em> when we actually needed them. My head still swimming, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to hear that, and strongly suggested that they recheck their schedule, as I was to pick them up around 11:00, and I could only afford the trip into Abbotsford once. After a few minutes of discussion, they assured me it would be ready on time.<br />
My gut started to feel a little like a saltwater taffy puller. Things were moving, and it wasn&#8217;t comfortable. I hadn&#8217;t eaten much to speak of, but hunger was the last thing on my mind. All I wanted was to have the day go off without a hitch. While Chris and Teak toiled away with their decorating, I headed to the bakery to get our cupcakes.<br />
By the time I&#8217;d arrived back, guests were already in attendance. I was in grubby clothes, unwashed hair and unshaven. Not to mention feeling wholly gross from the exploding infection in my bowels. And to top it all off, the two wait staff that we&#8217;d hired promptly asked where they could find the ice.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten the ice.<br />
After the fastest trip yet seen from the house to the corner store and back, I retreated to the basement to try and get ready. I figured a hot shower would help. All it did was call out to the dull ache in my lower back. The shave was like scraping nerve endings. I looked like I hadn&#8217;t slept in a week. I suited up nonetheless, determined not to let some lousy, stupid illness put an end to something that we&#8217;d been planning for months. Ache or no ache, the show had to go on.<br />
Everyone seemed to notice immediately that I wasn&#8217;t feeling up to scratch. But most people &#8212; including my lovely wife-to-be &#8212; were convinced that it was only &#8220;nerves&#8221;. I humoured them and went along with it, but knowing full well the difference between nerves and illness. For the most part, it wasn&#8217;t too bad, I was able to work with what we had, mingling and wandering around, before we actually went into wedding mode. Tie and jacket added, we started the service.<br />
Like most things in our wedding, it was largely unplanned. We had an approximate idea of what we needed, but we didn&#8217;t rehearse (no need to) and didn&#8217;t know how long it would take Paul to go through the speeches. In reality, I have no idea how long the service actually went. All I do know is that the shoes (new) combined with a lot of standing and the seemingly full-on assault to my inner abdomen was wreaking havoc with my back. Spasms periodically shook through my spine and it was everything to bite my tongue and tell Paul to move it along a bit quicker.<br />
To this day, Alex still says I didn&#8217;t enjoy my day. It wasn&#8217;t that I hated it, far from it &#8212; weddings are meant to be wonderful days, and we&#8217;d planned ours in that way on purpose. But I couldn&#8217;t enjoy it as much as her. I couldn&#8217;t eat. I couldn&#8217;t drink. I couldn&#8217;t think clearly. I didn&#8217;t get to partake of all the mingling that I&#8217;d wanted to. Taking the photographs afterwards was almost torture. I looked for every opportunity to sit down. In fact, one of my favourite pictures of us was when we were seated, and I was resting my head on Alex&#8217;s shoulder from sheer exhaustion. It looks angelic in print, even if it belies the torture going on underneath.<br />
The lack of clarity of thought really cut out a few things that I would have liked to do, namely get pictures of myself with those in attendance. As such, we have very little with those who came from afar. It&#8217;s my only regret of the day. The event wrapped up around 18:00 with people heading out into the evening. When most people had left, I headed back downstairs to get myself out of my suit and into something that felt less restrictive. The bed in the room I was changing in looked so inviting that I just couldn&#8217;t resist laying down for a moment.<br />
Alex found me there, passed out. When I awoke, the room spun in wild circles, like a midway ride gone wrong. I had to shut them almost immediately to prevent nausea. Alex let me rest another 30 minutes before we left for our hotel room in Langley. The trip there was hell. Every bump in the road sent pains up my body. Even the cool breeze didn&#8217;t help to clear anything. A card that Chris gave me sent me bawling from emotional overload. Though only a 30-minute trip, even 30 seconds was too long to get there.<br />
The running joke of the wedding night is this: hot and sweaty, without a lot of sleep. And that was just me.<br />
Despite a hot bath and almost having to call the biohazard disposal team from what had escaped from me (again, no vomiting), I still fired up the furnace of illness, actually forcing Alex to sleep at the far edge of the bed from me. It was too hot, even for her. The opposing chills that came were equally intolerable.<br />
The next morning I actually felt marginally better. I ate for the first time in almost a day and a half &#8212; a carrot muffin &#8212; before we headed out for our honeymoon. The idea had originally been to drive to Fairmont, a drive of about nine hours. But that had been scrapped even before my illness, when we realized that it was just unrealistic. Revelstoke seemed much better for our first leg. But even though I felt good enough to drive, we didn&#8217;t even make it as far as the Coquihalla Toll Booth. My system was going down again. Thirty minutes from Kamloops, my hips felt like they were imploding, my legs wouldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
They say married men live longer than single men. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re married, it&#8217;s because single men don&#8217;t have someone to force them to go to hospital when something&#8217;s wrong.<br />
For the record, the Royal Inland Hospital is a very nice facility that offers some really decent healthcare. They triaged me right away, including a bracelet and a urine test. I had to wait only a few minutes to get a bed, my own heart monitor (and blood oxygen monitor), and a nurse that checked in on me to get more information about how I was feeling. Alex was more distracted by all the gadgets in the curtained area than about me at this point &#8212; the problems with marrying someone in the health care industry&#8230;<br />
The trouble really came when the doctor came in. A decent fellow, he thought maybe the shellfish could be culprit, but he seemed doubtful. He carried out a conversation fairly nonchalantly, repeating most of the same topics the nurse had covered not long before. He was so smooth about it that he almost managed to get me to miss the blood test and IV he wanted to put me on.<br />
If you haven&#8217;t already heard, I don&#8217;t like needles. I hate them. Loathe them. Despise them. And now he wanted to put something in me not for a few moments, but a few <em>hours</em> to &#8230; do something (I didn&#8217;t ask what). I immediately started reacting by suggesting that there must be some other way. The doctor, wisely, looked at my new wife for support. She just looked at me, smiled, and softly said: &#8220;Suck it up, buttercup!&#8221;<br />
For the record, it was the best thing that could happen. Blood tests ain&#8217;t my thing, and while I didn&#8217;t dig the IV (having to take it down the hall to the toilet to deliver the ol&#8217; poop-in-a-hat test was something I never thought I&#8217;d have to do one day), I felt immeasurably better for having taken the two litres of saline. The majority of my issues were due to dehydration, and this was the best way to get me back on track.<br />
The doctor also informed us that the bacterial infection could potentially spread through body fluids, so we had to keep our respective distance for a few days. On our honeymoon, no less. The ultimate torture for newlyweds. But at least the cramping was gone and I didn&#8217;t have any relapses. It wasn&#8217;t until I got back to Calgary that I found out what I&#8217;d actually had (not the shellfish, that much was certain). Source unknown, but culprit found.<br />
One day, down the road, we&#8217;ll probably get remarried. Something fun, simple, and easy. And hopefully free of nasty bacteria.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke at 4:30 this morning, not originally knowing why I was tired. I had tried (unsuccessfully) to get myself drunk the night before. I wanted to numb the pain. I didn&#8217;t want that dull ache in my gut that told of bad times to come. I didn&#8217;t want to hear that voice that was trying to tell me what I was going to see. But I couldn&#8217;t drink fast enough. I couldn&#8217;t put a stop to the future.<br />
So this morning, I arose, dressed, and caught a cab to the airport. I checked in, made my way to the gate and boarded my plane destined for Toronto. All the while, and through the flight, I tried to simultaneously ignore and accept one simple truth:<br />
I&#8217;ve come home to watch my father die.<br />
This was not a trip I wanted to make. Partly because I&#8217;ve never dealt well with death. I universal constant it may be &#8212; but it&#8217;s one that still leaves me with the cold sweats, one that I sometimes wish didn&#8217;t exist. But I also didn&#8217;t want to come and see a man who was not the father I know and love.<br />
This is one time I&#8217;m glad death does exist. My father is in pain &#8212; perhaps not physical, but the pain of living as he is now probably makes up for it.<br />
This is all due to his worsening medical condition. Last year, my dad beat lung cancer. However, as we were celebrating the victory, some rogue cancer cells were preparing a second offensive in his brain. It led to the condition that brought me here today &#8212; a stroke that hit him early last Friday morning.<br />
Still in Calgary, I had to hear only news and stories from Mom and Cathy &#8212; how Dad couldn&#8217;t recognize people, or how he wanted things that, to us, made no sense.<br />
Today, things are a little better. At first, Mom and Cathy had to take care of Dad on their own. This was a burden they could not fulfill &#8212; it was wearing both of them down. So instead, the hired a nurse to look at his medical condition, a homemaker to change Dad&#8217;s clothes, wash him, and change his diaper (the stroke left Dad without basic bodily controls), and a &#8220;night watchman&#8221; to keep an eye on Dad while they slept.<br />
I walked into my parent&#8217;s home feeling very guilty. I have done nothing. I am almost an outsider here, feeling like I&#8217;m only a spectator in a macabre show. Cathy and Mom have done so much and I so little.<br />
Dad is bedridden. He sleeps in a hospital bed in what was once my bedroom. It is now the room he will likely spend his last days, however many they may be.<br />
Today, he saw many visitors: Ross Gray and Jimmy Johnston, old friends and co-workers from Truck &amp; Tractor &#8212; a company Dad worked for during most of my upbringing. Complete live wires, they had Dad laughing most of the morning, but also wore him down. Rod MacPherson, Cathy&#8217;s and my godfather, was also out. Auth Ruth, who picked me up at the airport, come down to see her brother and keep him in good cheer.<br />
Mrs. Robinson and Julie popped in and out. At one point in the afternoon, she came in to say that she could smell urine &#8212; Dad&#8217;s diaper needed changing. Cathy, Mrs. Robinson, and I took to the task of changing Dad&#8217;s diaper and rolling him on his side (as not to get bedsore).<br />
Most people look at their fathers as strong, powerful individuals &#8212; it&#8217;s a view of my father that I&#8217;ve had for whole life. But in the last year, I&#8217;ve been watching that view slowly develop little cracks. Today, the image was shattered by what seems to be a simple act.<br />
My father is a proud man. Fiercely independent, he had serious trouble when the progression of his illness cost him his driver&#8217;s license. But I&#8217;ve never seen the pain is experiencing &#8212; not until his daughter and his wife&#8217;s best friend, with the loose assistance of his son, changed his diaper.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if he really knew what was going on. But he looked like he wanted to cry. His dignity was gone, and he was now dependent on others. He puts up with it, but I doubt he likes it.<br />
Mind you, I&#8217;m not even sure Dad knows what&#8217;s happening to him. I almost hope he doesn&#8217;t &#8212; knowing that you&#8217;re doing to die is knowledge that I don&#8217;t think most people would want to know. I think Dad&#8217;s having a hard enough time without knowing that.<br />
Hell, I don&#8217;t want to know. I want to reset the clock back 12 years &#8212; back to high school. Things were easier then. The worst thing I had to worry about was my math homework.<br />
I know a lot of people who thing that I must be mad for wanting to go back in time to high school. But most people don&#8217;t seem to look past their own bad experiences &#8212; the cliques, the homework, the bad relationships. I was a simpler time, when families were stronger, and people healthier. While I wish I could dwell in the past, I can only look to the future.<br />
The next few days will be hard. If the doctor is right, we have only until the end of the week.<br />
Life is short, and unfair.<br />
Luckily though, the man in my old bedroom is still my father. He older, he&#8217;s frailer, and with almost no hair, but he knows who he is, who I am, and remembers the good times. I suppose that there is some comfort in that when the time comes, he&#8217;ll have seen me one last time.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Fewer things are harder than losing a loved one. I suppose it&#8217;s even worse when you lose them slowly. And it&#8217;s only worse when there&#8217;s nothing you can do about it.<br />
My father is dying. As you might recall, late last year, he beat lung cancer. What wasn&#8217;t immediately known was that when he started chemotherapy, the cancer decided it was time to hole up somewhere else. It found a new home in his brain.<br />
Brain cancer is one of the worst. Because it&#8217;s a &#8220;clean zone&#8221;, no chemotherapy will work &#8212; there are biological processes that keep those toxins out. (Though, interestingly enough, they&#8217;ll let cancerous cells in.) The cancer took hold, and started growing. While we were celebrating dad&#8217;s triumph over lung cancer, the unnoticed brain cancer was preparing for the second battle of the war.<br />
It&#8217;s a war that my father is likely to lose. When the tumour was found a month following his radiation treatment (during a follow-up CT scan), it immediately became a problem. It was almost as if the tumour knew that we knew it was there, and was bent on taking revenge for being forced out of the lung.<br />
The first thing to go was dad&#8217;s balance. The tumour was in the right place to throw that off. Steroids solved that problem &#8212; mostly. But it swelled his face quite a lot &#8212; a side effect, so he ended up looking much better off than he actually was.<br />
The last time I saw dad was at Christmas. He wasn&#8217;t the fastest moving, but he was more than capable of carrying out his Christmasy duties. No-one, really, was any wiser to what was yet to come.<br />
Only a few days after returning to Calgary, dad took a fall. Quite a bad one, and injured himself in the knee and ankle. He had to start using a walker &#8212; his lower body strength was atrophying (though his upper body strength seemed no worse). For my father, this was quite a blow, not just physically but also mentally &#8212; he&#8217;d lost his self-support. A prideful man, for him to rely on anything but himself was something I don&#8217;t think he was really ready to accept.<br />
This is common with my family. My grandmother was like this, too. My grandmother used to live in a two-storey Leaside home, until my father and aunt finally convinced her that she needed to move into a retirement home, where she could be looked after and she wouldn&#8217;t have to climb stairs. Although her mobility was fair, she could no longer smell or taste foods. It was a struggle to move her from her home of many decades &#8230; stubborn pride is a tough thing to fight.<br />
Today, I learned that despite another radiation treatment to retard the brain cancer, the disease is progressing &#8220;normally&#8221;. Although we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen, the doctor is hinting that my father will live only until about Christmas.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what I will do without my father. He&#8217;s always been such a wonderful source of information, and a role model that I can only dream of imitating. He tried so hard to be the perfect father, and yet there has always been a slight distance between us. I think it&#8217;s partly due to me &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the most affectionate child. The rest &#8230; well, it doesn&#8217;t matter, really. He&#8217;s my father, and I love him no matter the past or the future. This is not a year I&#8217;m looking forward to.<br />
Worse, though, is what Cathy will have to go through. Cathy is on the frontlines. She&#8217;s the one who has to deal with dad&#8217;s illness, the one who goes to the doctor, the one who keeps mom and dad going from day to day. I feel so bad because I cannot do the same. As much I would love to take the next six months off, go home and help out my parents, this I cannot do. Perhaps when I do finally find a home of suitable size, I can invite my parents to spend time out here, where I can try to care for them and take some of the load off Cathy, even if only for a while.<br />
This isn&#8217;t exactly the easiest time for all this, either. On a selfish side, I&#8217;ve got a change in my career (more management than implementation), the stress of hunting (and trying to purchase) a house, Cathy&#8217;s wedding (although I&#8217;m not doing a lot with it so far), trying to help out the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (but I&#8217;m swamped at work), and then there&#8217;s my father&#8217;s health mixed in with all of that. It&#8217;s hard.<br />
These are things I want to talk about with my friends. But what do you say? How do I not come across like someone who&#8217;s looking for attention? I just need to talk. My friends know be better than this, of course, so my problem is all with me.<br />
Right now, I can only do what Cathy does &#8212; live day to day. And hope that the doctor&#8217;s prognosis is wrong. He&#8217;s been off before, and maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; the stubbornness of the Sowrey family is enough to turn this around.</p>
