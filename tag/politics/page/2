		<p>I was sitting at my kitchen table, poring over recommendations I&#8217;m writing for my client (partially communicative, partially CYA), when I had one of those sudden thoughts: I need tea.  While I was drinking my tea &#8212; a pomegranate green tea, if you must know &#8212; I had one of those epiphanal moments when something becomes radically clear.<br />
Greed kills innovation.<br />
It&#8217;s short, it&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s sure to raise the ire of a lot of people, but it&#8217;s also a major problem we&#8217;re seeing lately, especially in internet technologies. It&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s dogged humanity for generations. And it&#8217;s getting worse.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The late 16th Century was the dawn of the British Empire. England had triumphed on the seas, and had set its eyes on colonising the New World (before its enemies did). Patents were issued, companies were founded, and flotillas of ships dispatched to every corner &#8212; known and unknown &#8212; of the planet in the name of Queen/King and country. Colonies were born out of determination, slavery, and blood extracted from those too weak to defend themselves from British will.<br />
In time, a phrase was born: The sun never sets on the British Empire. Great Britain&#8217;s influence extended far beyond its native shores, its power unquestionable. A few thrived under the colonial system, but the majority &#8212; the people living under colonial rule &#8212; were marginalised as being little more than the ignorant masses; significant numbers suffered horribly.<br />
It&#8217;s really no wonder that the Empire collapsed under its own weight.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">Dear Honourable Michael Ignatieff MP,</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">I recently read a CBC article where you made public a video of Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper in less than a positive light (http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/09/10/ignatieff-harper-speech.html). The article, including references to the video and a few comments from yourself, aimed to effectively attack Rt. Hon. Harper&#8217;s character and credibility. While this action may very well be justified in terms of raising awareness to the Canadian public, I (and likely many other Canadians) see this only as a prelude to what will likely be the fourth federal election in as many years.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">What you have before you is a problem, Hon. Ignatieff: you might be right, but Canadians are going to hate you for it. We&#8217;re going to hate you for doing exactly what every other politician running for a major office has done for the last quarter of a century: make the election personal.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">Canadians pride themselves on multiculturalism. We happily point to the different patches of our country that identify themselves as being distinct and unique. These are not faults, but are facets of a jewel that would not shine any other way. Along with those facets come &#8212; as an absolute requirement &#8212; differing perspectives, attitudes, and personalities. In effect, it ensures that no two people will approach the same scenario in the same manner.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">You must remove personalities from the equation. All that mudslinging achieves is to showcase pettiness and desperation. If all you have to bring up is someone else&#8217;s poor judgement, it makes us all wonder what you can bring to the table. It does not matter what Rt. Hon. Harper has personally said, regardless of how inflamatory those comments may be. Your position should be a higher one, not of a tattle-tale elementary schoolyard child, but of the correcting teacher who directs a class to overcome a poor decision.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">The Conservatives have something in their favour that the Liberals do not: since coming into power in 2006, the Conservatives have not made any serious mistakes &#8212; things that would normally cause Canadians to vote differently. That is a level of inertia that the Liberals &#8212; and you, as their leader &#8212; need to overcome.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">You have another inertia to overcome as well: Canadian political apathy. As you may recall, the 2008 federal election had the lowest turnout in Canadian history. If you wish to turn the tide, you have to encourage everyone not just to perform their civic duty, but be engaged in the direction of their country. That is a task that no Canadian political leader is willing to, at the risk of being attacked by the others. However, this is a risk you&#8217;ll need to take.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">And you need to take that risk to the west. I&#8217;m sure you saw the electoral map from the previous election (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/72/Canada_2008_Federal_Election.svg) &#8212; the west is a sea of blue, and your party acquired only seven seats. Alberta, in particular, love their Conservatives &#8212; attacking Harper will only lend sympathy rather than turning a tide. You need to appeal to the Western Canadian, and have them feel that Western Canada is as important to Canada as Quebec has been in previous elections.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">So, how? I don&#8217;t presume to preach to a politician, author, professor, and journalist. Instead, I would like to talk to you as a fellow Canadian. You don&#8217;t need to tell us what&#8217;s wrong with other politicians &#8212; you need to tell us what&#8217;s wrong with us, with our nation, with the things that we hold as dear and true to our identities as toques, beavers, hockey, and the maple leaf. And then inspire us to help repair those things, so that we become part of the solution, so we don&#8217;t just hand our problems to our government and expect everything to be fixed.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">We do not need promises or assurances. We need truths, no matter how hard they might be to hear. We need to be told &#8212; plainly &#8212; what has to happen. We need to be told that even the difficult is possible, and that hope isn&#8217;t just a word. We need to believe. We need to want.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">Ignore Rt. Hon. Harper. Ignore Hons. Duceppe, Layton, and May. Rise above them. Rise above the petty bickering. Make your message speak for itself, and speak to Canadians. Make us believe that you have a vision that means something more than merely acquiring office. If we are to go to the polls again, we have to know it&#8217;s for a good reason, and not because of a political spitting match. If you can bring faith back into Canadian politics, you may also bring greater enthusiasm and support.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">Sincerely,</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="width: 1px;height: 1px">Geoff Sowrey</div>

		<p>Maybe not the entire world, but certainly the wired world &#8212; the people online. All day, ever since I logged on, I&#8217;ve seen Tweets, blog posts, momentiles, and the like about people who are absolutely dying to see the results from the US election.  <br />
Most of those people want to see Obama win. (Or at least those are the ones I&#8217;ve seen.)<br />
I wonder, is this the most-watched election of all time (I say that because it likely is) due to Obama (and his chances of winning) or because of social networking bringing everyone out into the open?  <br />
There&#8217;s a thesis in this, I&#8217;m sure&#8230;</p>

		<p>This isn&#8217;t a predictive headline, folks. This is truth. The Conservatives will win the election in October. I, as an Expat, can&#8217;t vote in it, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t take at least a sense of interest in it. Or stock in the fact that the Conservatives are finally getting what they wanted the last time: Complete control.<br />
For the last two years, Canada has been living in the most blessed of political states: a minority government. As close to having the car in neutral as it gets. It means the least chance of political scandal (the &#8220;ruling&#8221; party doesn&#8217;t want to make mistakes that&#8217;ll haunt them come election time), and the opposition enjoys a place of perceived power as they get courted by the ruling party to help push through votes.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s all coming to an end now. So brace yourself, Canada &#8212; things are likely to get worse.<br />

<blockquote><p>Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said the Games would &#8220;help the world to understand China, and it will also help China to understand the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think we need to send a team into the IOC&#8217;s fantasy world and extract them, because they&#8217;ve clearly (and totally) misunderstood the situation.<br />

Heck, it could be like that already, for all we know.<br />

		<p>Yep, believe it or not, there was an election in Alberta yesterday. Provincial. New MLAs, new premier (in theory), all that jazz. In most provinces, it&#8217;s usually time of actual change &#8212; old regimes are voted out, new ones come to power, more scandals (from different angles), and (this is the important part) an opposition party that actually has some teeth.<br />
But this is Alberta. Nothing ever changes in Alberta. The PCs being in an overwhelming majority is like the sun coming up in the morning.<br />
