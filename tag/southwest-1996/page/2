	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dawn arrives early at high altitudes, but we didn&#8217;t notice until around 09:00 that morning. Dawn also arrives very cold. When we went to bed, the temperature was something in the neighbourhood of 10 degrees Celsius. Not terribly warm, but when you&#8217;ve been having cold temperatures for six months, 10 degrees is not too bad. When we woke up the next morning, the temperature was somewhere close to zero.<br />
I woke after Dhar. I don&#8217;t know how long he had been up, but no sooner than I had opened my eyes that he was looking back. Both Stefan and Rebecca were asleep, showing no signs of immediate arousal. I raised the window curtain next to me and peered out into the early Colorado morning. The clouds that had shrouded Pikes Peak the previous day were gone, the sky was a perfection of blue. The sun cast long shadows but shone directly on the front of the van, lighting the interior.<br />
Immediately I noticed the cold. I hadn&#8217;t felt this since I had last gone camping. It was a damp cold too, mostly from the condensation inside the van. Most of the ceiling and windows were covered with large beads of water. I wondered if it was from humid air that we had somehow brought with us (not too likely considering how often the windows were open), or from our breathing. Either way, there was about a litre of moisture on the walls.<br />
A rustling of the sheets behind me and a few mumbled words indicated that at least one of our two remaining sleepers was beginning the agonizing stages of waking up. As it turned out we placed the two worst morning people together &#8212; a marriage of convenience, if you will. Both Stefan and Rebecca take forever to get up in the morning, though Rebecca is about a hundred times worse than her other half. The irony was Rebecca continually complained of Stefan&#8217;s lack of motion in the morning, yet he was always up before her.<br />
Dhar and I took this sign as an opportunity to draw all the curtains and go outside and see what morning in the Rockies felt like. I could hear mumbled protests from in and under sleeping bags and pillows about not only the noise, but the sudden increase in the light level.<br />
Colorado Springs is the only place I have ever been that had crisp air that wasn&#8217;t in the middle of winter. Normally, that crisp feeling only comes at some God-awful point in the winter when it&#8217;s so cold your nostril hairs freeze when you breathe through your nose. Except for the temperature and the frozen nostril hairs, Colorado Springs had that same feeling when you breathed.<br />
I smiled to myself, a remnant of a much earlier trip. When I had gone to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1989, Keith Black, the tour group leader, had continually said: &#8220;Smile, you&#8217;re in a different country.&#8221; (See [[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Introduction|My Trip to the Soviet Union]]) The United States is old news for a Canadian living so near to the border and has visited a few states. But nothing I had seen or experienced before prepared me for the sights of the Midwest. I smiled because for the first time, I really knew what Keith Black had meant.<br />
I had noticed Fountain Creek when we had arrived the night before, but hadn&#8217;t really bothered to take a look at it. The creek bed lay about 100 feet directly in front of the van, just to the east of where we were. The creek was low, and might even run dry during the summer months. The winter run-off had already come and gone, as the washed back grasses and debris testified to. The creek couldn&#8217;t have been more than a foot deep, but was probably only a couple degrees above freezing.<br />
Suddenly to my left, I saw something move. Looking over, I saw a medium-sized cat. At first I thought it was a wild cat, considering how it had lurched when I arrived. But when I got a good look at it, I realized that it had been a tourist&#8217;s cat that had gone feral.<br />
I was reminded of a book I had read, Tony Hillerman&#8217;s Skinwalkers. It&#8217;s a story of Navajo Tribal Policemen trying to solve a bizarre string of murders &#8230; a fairly typical plot idea. One of the main characters keeps a sort of watch over a feral cat that moves into a shelter near his trailer. Hillerman described the cat in a very specific way: under-nourished; looking like it had been well-bred; and very wild looking, like it was relying on its wits for survival.<br />
The cat before me was a domestic breed, but not a pure bred. It was definitely not a wild cat. Not yet. How long it had been in the wild I couldn&#8217;t tell &#8212; it was either a quick learner or a very good hunter. Either way, the cat seemed much better off than its literary cousin. It shared the same wild look in its eyes, which shone brighter than the sun. I know house cats, this cat was now closer to being a puma than a pussy.<br />
When I got back Stefan had finally pulled himself out of the bed, and was finding all the stuff he needed to have a shower. I decided to follow suit. I quickly realized however that my towel was still very damp from the night before (it really hadn&#8217;t dried during the night, which may also explain all the condensation on the walls and ceiling). Having a shower would obviously make me feel better, but I would have no way of drying myself off. Rebecca mumbled a nearly coherent idea about the hand dryers in the washrooms.<br />
I collected my toiletries and followed Dhar over to the washrooms. Alas, a hand dryer was nowhere to be found. I sighed and returned to the van, accidentally forgetting my shampoo on the counter. Stefan was entering the bathroom just as I left. When I got back, the doors were locked. My initial thought was that Stefan and Rebecca had locked themselves in. As it happened, Stefan had locked the door leaving Rebecca behind while he showered.<br />
Rebecca was still in bed when I knocked on a side window and announced that whatever it was that Stefan and Rebecca were doing would have to wait. When Rebecca opened the door, she gave me a bit of an odd look. I attributed it to her not quite hearing what I had said, and her general lack of alertness (Rebecca was not a morning person, especially without a large cup of coffee within arm&#8217;s reach). Rebecca promptly turned around, walked back to the rear of the van and buried herself in the sleeping bags, mumbling something about never waking up again.<br />
When Stefan returned, he looked much like a drowned rat who had tried to dry off by shaking the water from its fur. I don&#8217;t know how Stefan always managed to look like that, but I&#8217;ll give him one thing: he was consistent. He immediately apologized for forgetting that he had locked the van when he left. Rebecca grabbed her things and the infamous &#8220;purple bag&#8221; of toiletries from Stefan, and left to do her thing in the washroom. Dhar arrived a moment later and handed me a large beige bottle of Pantene shampoo. I mentally kicked myself in the rear for forgetting it.<br />
Having some of the Behemoth&#8217;s members back gave me the opportunity to give a quick call home. I hadn&#8217;t wanted to do so during the day, considering how much it would cost, but I knew full well that it would be rather difficult to coordinate my times with my parents. They didn&#8217;t like anyone calling after 22:00, so I chose the lesser of two evils and would call at 09:00 &#8230; 11:00 their time.<br />
I wandered over to the pay phone at the back of the KOA office, carrying my daily planner (which, as you&#8217;ll remember from two chapters ago, was doubling as our expenses log during the trip &#8230; not that this particular detail is of any use on this particular occasion) so I could jot down my medical insurance number in case my mother had managed to find it. Taking a suggestion from Stefan, I used the 1-800-Collect(r) service to get through to home. I found it not only a lot easier to use than the system I had used the day before (all I had to do was key in my home number), but also a lot faster to connect.<br />
This time my mother wasn&#8217;t panicky when she picked up the phone. This was probably because I told her I would call when I got to Colorado. It wasn&#8217;t entirely true, I had to call her sometime later, but I was keeping with my word. She hadn&#8217;t found my insurance number. This wasn&#8217;t surprising considering the condition of my room when I left (which, as my mother would often comment, befitting of the local waste disposal site). She asked me the typical questions: &#8220;How are you?&#8221;, &#8220;What are you eating?&#8221;, &#8220;Did you sleep well?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you wearing clean underwear?&#8221;<br />
I kept the conversation short for two reasons: 1) It was expensive calling long distance from the States during the day, even if 1-800-Collect(r) said you could save up to 40% on the call (shameless plug); and 2) My mother&#8217;s questions always annoyed the hell out of me. Hanging up, I walked around to the front of the office to buy postcards.<br />
KOAs make life very simple: everything you need is at arm&#8217;s reach &#8230; though not quite so literally. All of them carried postcards and stamps, although the staff wasn&#8217;t always on the ball with how much postage cost. Normally 40 cents (American), I was first quoted 20 cents in Colorado Springs, and 50 cents when we hit Albuquerque.<br />
The clerk at the desk was the same one we had dealt with the night before. I bid her a good morning as I set about the task of selecting appropriate postcards. At first I was going to buy five cards every place we stayed, one for my parents and one for my close friends at home: Scott, Tara, Chris and Kathryn. But as I quickly learned, many of the places we stayed (including the KOA) had the ol&#8217; four-for-a-buck deal. Now I don&#8217;t want to sound cheap, but saving money on postcards was a blessing, since I sent over $20 (American) of postcards and stamps home. Scott and Tara (who were seeing each other &#8230; and still are) were lumped together.<br />
I chose pictures of Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, miscellaneous mountains, and the tackiest postcard I could find. Scott had challenged me to send him all the tacky (or as he had said, &#8220;cheesy&#8221;) postcards to him that I could find. This proved to be a huge challenge, since for some reason good-looking postcards had become more popular than the bad ones.<br />
Having chosen my cards, I asked the clerk for postage. At the time I had no idea of how much postage to get. Unfortunately, neither did the clerk. But she said that 20 cents would get me just about anywhere, so I bought four 20 cents stamps. I filed the stamps and postcards in my organizer so I wouldn&#8217;t lose them and promptly started to head back to the van. Just as I was leaving, I thought to see if a postbox was nearby. The clerk indicated a small stand-up box just outside the door.<br />
Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar were sitting at the picnic table next to the van, poring over the maps we had, and arguing about where we would be going next. Stefan&#8217;s desire to stay in Colorado and travel about the different canyons and natural sights was being shot down by both Rebecca and Dhar. (No, Stefan hadn&#8217;t relented from the argument we all engaged in two days earlier.) I decided it wasn&#8217;t necessary for me to put a word in since my goals were being met through the dual attack. After only a minute or two, Stefan finally gave up and capitulated to figuring out where we were to go next.<br />
The TripTik provided by CAA was promptly pitched on a shelf &#8212; we were going to do the route the way we wanted to do it. Actually, the way they wanted to do it. I personally wanted to follow the TripTik because it would save us time in getting to our destination, which I assumed to be Las Vegas. I hadn&#8217;t yet shaken my habit of efficiency and punctuality.<br />
This was a problem for me, I loved efficiency. If there&#8217;s one thing I really couldn&#8217;t stand, it was wasting time driving the long way to a place. When I planned road trips, it was using a modified MST, a computer term for Minimum Spanning Tree. In plain English, this is the shortest combined distance (or measure) along a given series of points. In our case, the overall shortest distance meant we would first go to Las Vegas, then hit the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon. That was by my methods.<br />
I will be the first to point out that my methods aren&#8217;t always the best ones. And this was just such an example. The route according to the TripTik was to go south on Highway 115 to Highway 50, where we would travel almost due west until we reached Grand Junction, where we would pick up I-70. This would take us to I-15, which would take us directly to Las Vegas. But in doing so, we would have missed some of the most spectacular scenery I have ever seen. At some point in your life, you need to stop and smell the roses, or you miss living. The roses were especially sweet that day.<br />
So Stefan got at least part of his wish, which was to take a scenic route through the Rockies to Cortez, Colorado. There we would spend the night before heading to the Grand Canyon. But more on that when I get to it.<br />
Before we would leave, we decided that we should see something of Colorado Springs. The two principle things on our list were the Cave of the Winds and Pikes Peak. According to the AAA Colorado TourBook, Pikes Peak ran a Cog Railway to the top, but only in good weather. The Cave of the Winds was supposedly open all year long, but in any case I wanted to check. While the others continued to bicker over what roads we were going to take, I headed over to the phone.<br />
Interesting Fact: American phones don&#8217;t take Canadian quarters. Americans in general tend to dislike Canadian change. We found this out a few times when we accidentally (honestly!) mixed a couple Canadian pennies in with our American change. This (luckily) never happened to me, but Dhar and Rebecca both were scolded for &#8220;attempting to cheat&#8221; a retailer. I, purely out of curiousity, wanted to see if a Canadian quarter would work.<br />
According to the receptionist at Pikes Peak, the cog railway had not run the 09:00 run due to snow on the tracks. The receptionist didn&#8217;t know if the 13:00 train would run for the same reason, but suggested I call back at 12:00 to find out. This unfortunately ruled a trip to the top of Pikes Peak out because we simply didn&#8217;t have the time, at least in my humble opinion. Cave of the Winds was open, and all tours were running normally at regular intervals.<br />
I relayed this information to my comrades, who were still in disagreement about the routes. (For the record, this was the only time we had a real debate about which way we would go. For some reason, the rest of the United States was not a point of contention.) Stefan was dead set on the scenic route. I was more for the more direct approach, but agreed that the scenic route was a possibility provided we had the time to drive it. Then Dhar and Rebecca gave in and agreed to the deal. The majority won. I lost. Stefan smiled broadly &#8212; he finally got something to go his way for a change.<br />
We began the procedure of packing up. I went around to the driver&#8217;s side of the van to disconnect the hose and electrical cord. I quickly realized that someone had turned the water off in the night, assumedly to prevent hoses from bursting &#8212; a wise precaution. Following my father&#8217;s instructions, I blew any extra water out of the hoses, coiled the hose and connected the ends together to prevent any dirt or bugs from collecting inside. I also put away the propane tank, having found that it resealed itself during the night. At first I thought it might have been due to the cold, but I had let it sit in the sun for about an hour, and no further leakage appeared.<br />
Following another of my father&#8217;s instructions, I checked the van&#8217;s oil and engine coolant. My father is a stickler for things like that, particularly when cars are involved. My father does most of the maintenance on our vehicles, and in a way he expects me to be like him. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I work on computers, not cars. I actually prefer biking whenever possible.<br />
The van roared to life minutes later. My father drilled into our family to always let a car engine warm up before going anywhere, just to make sure there&#8217;s no strain on the engine&#8217;s parts. While the engine warmed, we filled several left over two litre plastic Coke bottles so we would have an ample water supply. Stefan warned us that we would dehydrate quickly at the altitudes we would be traveling at. I, for one, was not willing to take risks like that.<br />
I took first shift driving, and our first stop was the pump station. Although we never used our toilet, the washing of the dishes, my brushing my teeth, and the general use of the sink faucet had collected a lot of water in the gray water tank, which I wanted to dump before gallivanting around the Rockies. Rebecca and Stefan headed to the KOA office to get postcards and whatnot, Dhar stuck around to watch.<br />
Pumping stations are usually fairly simple things: a hole in the ground (into a holding tank) with a water hose to wash any spillage. The smell is absolutely atrocious. If you&#8217;ve ever used an outhouse, imagine a smell 100 times worse. I never want to know about the things that end up in a holding tank.<br />
Under the driver door is a running board step. This step is hinged and flips up to reveal the van&#8217;s propane tank with its valve, and the sewage hose with the tank valve handles. Unscrewing a small cap and pulling back a metal plate releases the hose from its tube, pulling out to a distance of about ten feet. But since I parked right next to the holding tank cover, I needed only a couple feet. I pulled back on the handles and dumped our dirty water.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were still milling around inside the office when we got there. Dhar and I went in to see what they were doing. I took the opportunity to purchase another four twenty cent stamps to correct the oversight on my postcards.<br />
I dropped the postcards in the drop box on our way out, boarded the van, and prepared to head back up I-25 to Cave of the Winds. The trip back was a little on the convoluted side, with all the off-ramps and road construction, but soon we found Highway 24 and started heading west. Unlike the day before, we didn&#8217;t cross over to Colorado Avenue, since we would have had to remerge onto Highway 24 further down.<br />
After a little while we found the exit for Cave of the Winds. It was in fact, a set of stoplights. We turned right and started heading up a road up the side of a mountain. A sign at the entrance told us to ask for assistance if we were driving a large vehicle. However the booths at the base of the mountain, where the help was supposed to be, were vacant. I sighed to myself, shifted into a lower gear, and prepared to see if I could keep ourselves from sliding off the road into a fiery death.<br />
The incline of the road varied but was at least a 6% grade, probably extending into the double digits in a few places. The road was narrow too, so I had to be extra specially careful when going around corners to make sure I didn&#8217;t fall off the edge. To top it all off, the road zig-zagged its way up the side of the mountain. It made Lombard Street in San Francisco look like a straight-away.<br />
The others oohed and aahed as I slowly guided our way up. I kept my eyes glued firmly to the road, not wanting to be distracted by a damn thing. Only once did I have to pass a car coming down, and for that I was thankful. I once caught a glimpse of the edge of the road, and frankly, it scared the hell out of me.<br />
When we reached the top, we drove around to a pull-through parking spot and climbed out. We weren&#8217;t too sure what we should wear inside, but I took the precaution and wore my shoes. Caves tend to keep a constant temperature, and it&#8217;s usually cooler than on the surface. Rebecca and Stefan wore sandals. Dhar would wear shoes until Las Vegas, and would hardly ever take off his jeans.<br />
The view from up there was amazing, but a neighbouring ridge blocked our view of Colorado Springs. I snapped off a few shots of the camera before we headed towards the Cave&#8217;s entrance. Along the way we found the grandstands used for the laser light show, something we were two weeks too early to see, and a miniature replica of an old-West saloon for kids to crawl through.<br />
The Cave entrance was a building built on the side of the mountain. On its main level was a lounge, containing flyers for other attractions, a love tester, and a black hole simulator for coins. Any good tourist trap needs to have a black hole simulator. Below the lounge was an arcade which according to Stefan had an old Zaxxon video game machine. Across from the building&#8217;s entrance was the gift shop, were we would get our tickets for the trip.<br />
We would be a part of tour 13. Lucky us. The shop was heavily unpopulated, containing a small handful of tourists, almost as many clerks, and a couple repairmen getting the store ready for tourist season. I guesses that tourist season had not opened yet. (Be vewy, vewy quiet. We&#8217;re hunting tourists. Hehehehehehe.)<br />
We opted for the Discovery Tour, a 40 minute quickie of the Caves. Also available was the Lantern Tour, which was slightly longer than our tour and performed completely with dimly lit lanterns; and the Wild Tour, a 6 hour trek through the mud and muck that makes up the harder to access parts of the cave. Ours was the cheapest, the quickest, and probably the cleanest (the brochures recommended that you wear coveralls and bring a change of clothes if you take the Wild Tour).<br />
We had to wait about 15 minutes before our tour left. This gave us time (perhaps too much) to wander about the store and see what there was. We found all sorts of tacky tourist souvenirs, including a series of cedar hand paddles with cute comments such as &#8220;Attitude Adjuster&#8221; and &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Little Helper&#8221;. I found an interesting law framed on one of the walls. Desecrating the cave (that is, breaking any of the natural formations or writing on the walls) resulted in a $500 fine and a potential 30 days in jail. I read the particulars, but nearly choked when I read that the law had been written in the mid-1800&#8217;s. That law was still in effect.<br />
Slightly below the legal notice was something I had considered a relic of times past: a sign indicating a fallout shelter. I had to point this out to (I believe it was) Stefan, remarking that the idea seemed a bit absurd. I was referring to the use of the sign at all, not the fact that the cave was a designated shelter. Stefan seemed to misinterpret my meaning, and replied that a cave would be an ideal shelter. This I never doubted, but the fact that the sign still existed was both curious and worrisome.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca both bought lollipops. Nothing in that action was overly interesting, only that the lollipops were all-natural and hand-made. Rebecca&#8217;s was a chocolate and peanut butter flavour, one that I must admit is unusual. Rebecca, originally enthralled with the idea, quickly found that the flavour was none too inviting.<br />
When the boarding call came we proceeded to a door on the north side of the gift shop, next to the frame that held the law. We handed over the little plastic tour tickets to the attendant then walked out to a small porch. There we waited until the tour guide appeared. He looked young, probably in his mid-20&#8217;s or so, and strongly built &#8212; this guide either worked out a lot, or did far too much spelunking for his own good.<br />
He gave us a quick run down of the rules, mostly involving desecration of the cave. A couple words about chewing gum, and then he noticed Dhar and Rebecca sucking on their lollipops. They too were a no-no (the lollipops, not my compatriots), and were quickly tucked away in bags wrapped in waxed paper.<br />
The entrance to the cave was through a short tunnel apparently dug out of the side of the mountain to allow for easier access to tourists. The original cave entrance, used by the two boys who discovered it, was further down the side of the mountain and much harder to use.<br />
The cave was not at all what I expected. Most of my knowledge of caves came from the pages of National Geographic, television documentaries, and whatever books I happened to read. (And people wonder when I describe myself as a nerd &#8230; go figure!) All of them depicted rock or dirt floors, lots of running water, stalactites and stalagmites, crystal formations, and little unnatural lighting. In other words, caves that had seen little of mankind. Cave of the Winds was a commercial cave, not run by the U.S. Park Service. It was &#8220;improved&#8221; to make it more accessible to tourists.<br />
The first stop was less than 20 feet into the cave, where the tour operators had a camera set up to take pictures of the tour members. Almost everyone on the tour were couples, except for a single elderly man (whose wife didn&#8217;t want to go into the cave), a couple with their toddler, and our group of four. In all there were about fifteen people in the tour group. The picture was nothing special, we were officially known as Group 13D, and would see our picture when we got out. This I found rather interesting since I knew that it would take nearly 30 minutes just to develop the film. The 8.5 x 11 pictures would take almost as long (under normal circumstances), and the tour was only about 45 minutes. (One of the advantages of having worked at a Black&#8217;s Camera shop is you pick up these things &#8212; the absolute fastest we could develop film was 45 minutes.)<br />
The first point of the actual tour was a large room about 100 feet long, about 40 wide and sloping from about 10 to 40 feet high. Here we were shown the original entrance, since barred over to prevent people getting stuck or lost. Also here was a time capsule, to be opened around the year 2080. The tour guide invited one and all to come back to witness its contents. We happily laughed at an otherwise lame joke.<br />
And so we walked down the concrete pathways with their aluminum, brass, and iron railings; up the concrete steps; marveled at the coloured lights that shone on the broken cave formations. I actually felt sorry for the cave, having to put up with humans continually wandering through, leaving behind their mark. I&#8217;m not a rabid environmentalist, but I&#8217;m not for destroying the world. As a camper, I strongly believe in leaving things as they were found, leaving nothing behind. I would have been much happier seeing the cave with lanterns, knowing how little of it had been changed.<br />
The Cave of the Winds holds the record for America&#8217;s highest commercial cave. I assumed that means that there are other caves higher than Cave of the Winds that are protected by the U.S. Park Service, but chose not to clarify the tour guide&#8217;s statements.<br />
Some parts of the cave were interesting. On one of the ceilings were a series of cave flowers, which are crystal formations that grow out like flowers. To prevent people from trying to pick them, the tour operators covered the flowers with wire mesh. Albeit ugly, the mesh kept the flowers for all to see, at least what was left of them. Many of the flowers were visibly broken or altogether missing.<br />
Fat Man&#8217;s Misery / Tall Man&#8217;s Agony was a rather interesting place to visit. It was so named due to its low ceiling (requiring tall people to almost have to walk through on all fours) and its narrow width. Only children could enter the passage without having to bend or crouch. I couldn&#8217;t help but call out &#8220;Everybody limbo!&#8221; like a boisterous Ricardo Montalban as I entered the passage.<br />
The Cave of the Winds, despite its name, was formed mostly through water pressure. Many caves (such as Mammoth Cave) are formed through water erosion, which although similar in nature, is still different. Natural erosion takes place over hundreds of thousands of years; water dripping and seeping through cracks eventually opens chambers. Under water pressure, the sheer force of water eroded the cave, most likely in a shorter span of time. When Cave of the Winds was formed, it was much closer to sea level than it is now. Many parts of the cave showed this erosion through pressure, the swirls and indentations of the currents were plain to see.<br />
We exited the cave nearly an hour after entering, leaving the cool 58 degrees Fahrenheit behind and returning to a much warmer 75 degrees. Upon exiting, our pictures were ready. The picture was nothing special, a simple 8.5 x 11 inch photo in a stiff paper frame. I was tempted to ask if we could buy the negative rather than the picture. That notwithstanding, Dhar bought the picture.<br />
We wandered about the gift shop for a few minutes while Dhar got his change from the store. Rebecca took the opportunity to buy some homemade fudge that the store sold. She was a bit confused about the flavour she was buying, since she had never heard of a Heath Bar. In Canada, we know the Heath Bar better as a Skor candy bar. I find the name &#8220;Heath&#8221; a rather interesting one for a candy bar, since the word &#8220;heath&#8221; means &#8220;wasteland&#8221;. (Part of the joys of being an English major.) Incidentally, the fudge was magnificent.<br />
The drive back down the mountain was not quite as nerve-wracking as the trip up, although I&#8217;m not too sure why. This time, I could see down the mountain, and it should have frightened me half to death. Maybe it was that I could see where I was going (the way up was mostly obscured by the cliffs). But the van remained in second gear the whole time to keep it from moving too fast, my foot firmly on the brake.<br />
The next issue was food. Not necessarily lunch, but food from which we could make meals. We opted not to return to Colorado Springs, but continue west on Highway 24 until we found a more appropriate place to buy our nourishment. When we reached Woodland Park about twenty minutes later, Dhar was too hungry to wait any longer.<br />
McDonald&#8217;s is not exactly known for their fine cuisine. In fact, a Big Mac is almost at the bottom of things I would eat when given a choice. But Dhar was in the mood for a McChicken &#8230; or a Filet O&#8217; Fish, one of those dumbly named sandwiches. I wasn&#8217;t too hungry and decided that a couple cheeseburgers would fill the void that was forming in my stomach.<br />
School was out for lunch. Everywhere I looked were high school students, and most of them looked rather undeveloped &#8212; I figured the hamburgers they were eating had higher IQs. As I looked around the establishment, I followed Stefan&#8217;s gaze to a family eating lunch. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so interesting as it was to realize that the family was wearing what appeared to be their Sunday best, and had dragged Grandma along for the ride. I shook my head silently, not understanding how someone could classify Raunchy Ron&#8217;s as good eating.<br />
Mind you, this particular McDonald&#8217;s seemed to be caught in a bit of a time warp (though none quite so severe as the Kansas Interspatial Distortion). On the wall next to the door next to the door we had entered through was a Mac Tonight sign. I suddenly had a flashback to the failed ad campaign McDonald&#8217;s launched in the mid-80&#8217;s to get people to eat at McDonald&#8217;s for dinner. The waning moon-head of the character was oddly disturbing, even more so when I was surrounded by people that some anthropologists might consider throwbacks to the Stone Age.<br />
We didn&#8217;t leave for quite some time, Dhar&#8217;s order took a while. Even when we did leave, we had to come back to retrieve the sandwiches he forgot. What a silly bunt! We continued along Highway 24, now looking for two things: a grocery store and a liquor store. (But you don&#8217;t even know her!) We didn&#8217;t even need to leave Woodland Park to fill that need. Stefan and I waited while Rebecca and Dhar shopped for sustenance. This gave me a chance to finish my lunch.<br />
I can eat a Canadian McDonald&#8217;s cheeseburger regardless of what its temperature is, or when it was made. The cheeseburgers I had just bought were freshly made (I had seen them made), but tasted horrible. American beef has a lot of fat and hormones in it, that is fact. Beyond that, I don&#8217;t know what else it could have been. The meat was like gray mush, there was only one lousy pickle, and the onions had no flavour. It was the worst hamburger &#8230; sorry, cheeseburger that I had ever eaten. It was the last American hamburger I ate during the entire trip.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what Dhar and Rebecca were doing, but they took nearly a half hour to buy a few bags of food. That included cans of corn and green beans, pancake mix, popcorn, tortillas, chicken, hot dog buns, green peppers, orange juice, and my personal favourite: fruit loops. Not the Kellogg version, but some knock-off that was cheaper, but just as high in sugar content.<br />
While Rebecca and I saw to the storing of the food, Dhar and Stefan saw to the purchasing of alcoholic substances: Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, and a large bottle of cheap wine. Neither exactly my flavour.<br />
Stefan guided me out of the parking spot (which had me on an angle pointing down a hill), and out into the driving lane. A few moments later and we were once again heading west on Highway 24. The day was bright, the air was warm, and we had almost seven hours and over 6,000 feet of elevation to traverse before arriving in Cortez later that night. By this time I had accepted the scenic route as the decided course, and on such a day it was not to be a course to be forgotten.<br />
The lack of clouds in the sky, the snowy caps of the mountains, the immense conifer forests became absolutely breathtaking. The roads wound in, around and through the hills and valleys that made up the Rocky mountains and the plains that exist between the ranges. Several times we stopped for pictures and to look at the beauty without the obstruction of the van. It wasn&#8217;t long before we left Highway 24 and started on Highway 50.<br />
Our highest point was Monarch Pass, which we arrived at about two hours after leaving Woodland Park. At 11,312 feet above sea level, both the Behemoth and I were having problems getting a good breath of oxygen. I felt a little light headed. We stopped as we crept up the pass, pulling over to the side for a while to have a brief snowball fight. The last time I had run around in the snow in my shorts had been about three years earlier when I was visiting a friend in Montreal. And this time I wasn&#8217;t even wearing my shoes &#8212; they were tucked away somewhere in the closet, I was wearing my sandals sans socks.<br />
Stefan took over driving from that point. I concentrated on seeing things I had never seen before. Rebecca and Dhar retreated to the back of the van to play cards, as they were very prone to doing. Stefan seemed to get really annoyed at this, he was very enthusiastic about all the nature we were seeing, and all Rebecca and Dhar could do was play cards. I stayed out of the argument, preferring to watch the world pass us by.<br />
Driving down the pass was almost as much fun as driving up. Stefan kept the van in second gear pretty much the whole way down, not wanting to burn out the brakes as we descended. Fortunately, the pass isn&#8217;t widely traveled and traffic was fairly low. The odd semi-trailer would drive it, and we usually passed them going in the opposite direction. Though just as we were exiting, we ran into one.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take Stefan long to get around it, the van having found new life at 9,000 feet, and we quickly found ourselves in the middle of cattle country. Everywhere we looked were cows, steers, and the odd bison. It seemed that it was breeding time too, as one bull on our right quickly told us. Outside of nature documentaries, I had never actually seen animals on the verge of mating. To be honest, I was envious &#8212; animals make it look so easy, they don&#8217;t have to deal with all the bullshit surrounding human relationships.<br />
One bull suddenly started gushing fluids from its groin, and it started to mount one of the cows. Rebecca sounded almost like a giddy schoolgirl witnessing sex for the first time. She shrieked about &#8220;how large it is&#8221;. I had to feel sorry for Stefan, that somewhere he felt he was being compared to an animal whose phallus resembled a metre-long heat seeking moisture missile. (Metaphor intended.)<br />
About halfway along Highway 50, just outside Gunnison, we stopped for pictures at a kind of picnic area. The road into the small park had an interesting feature that I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and that we saw almost continually until we reached Louisiana: a large steel grating made of parallel bars. It ran between the fence posts at either side of the road. I was justifiably curious, not knowing what it was. Stefan was quick to explain that animals, particularly cloven ones, are unable to cross the grating. It saves money as you don&#8217;t have to build or maintain a gate.<br />
The roadway inside the tiny reserve was poor, not likely having been repaired in some time. But the park did have one thing that I found useful &#8212; a Johnny-On-The-Spot. Not exactly the Ritz as far as the smell is concerned, but a welcome relief nonetheless.<br />
The view from the lookout was breathtaking. The lookout was perched right on the edge of a hill, which quickly dropped just below us. Just a few miles ahead was Gunnison, laying part way into a vast plain. Across it were more mountains. I took out the panoramic for another picture, pausing just before taking it when I had a much better idea.<br />
I had Rebecca, Dhar and Stefan position themselves in the middle and at the edges of the viewfinder so that they effectively split the picture in three. As it turned out, the picture looked pretty good (for a disposable camera with a cheap plastic lens), although I found that the viewfinder is a little smaller than the lens&#8217; view when I saw the picture two weeks later.<br />
Just outside Gunnison, on the other side of town, we came across the Blue Mesa reservoir. Somewhere down river, one of the Governments (either State or Federal) had built a dam, creating the reservoir. But this reservoir was strangely depleted. We had arrived at the reservoir just following the spring run-off, during which a reservoir should be filled almost to the limit. Yet the water level was at least 30 feet below what appeared to be the normal water line.<br />
Huge strips of land connected what would normally be islands with the shore. Exposed lake bed glowed a yellowish-brown, marked with a few large rocks every so often. Stefan and I commented to each other repeatedly about the water level, several times trying to get Rebecca and Dhar to express any interest in the phenomenon. But they were too engrossed in their card game to really care too much.<br />
After cross a bridge to the south side of the reservoir, we stopped a little ways down at an interesting mesa hillside visible on the north side of the reservoir. Erosion had cut tall fingers out of the hill, creating a sort of effect of someone having dragged a huge comb through the soil.<br />
About an hour later we reached Montrose, where Highway 50 ended. The sun was beginning to set on us, and I was beginning to have serious doubts of getting to Cortez before 20:00 that evening. A quick calculation proved that the earliest we could get there was at 21:30, well past the KOA&#8217;s office hours. We turned onto Highway 550 for our half-hour trip to Ridgway where we would pick up Route 62, continuing the Scenic Route.<br />
The shadows grew long, hiding all the trees and cliffs. Soon all around us was darkness, and a desperate need to go to the bathroom. Montrose looked deserted when we passed it, so we had to continue in our quest for relief. I suggested we get familiar with the on-board toilet. However, a certain member of our regiment steadfastly insisted she could last.<br />
Soon we reached Route 145, which would take us indirectly to Cortez. I refuse to say &#8220;directly&#8221; because the road weaved in and out of hills and valleys in a huge zig-zag. The first major bend was just outside of Telluride, where we found an open gas station. Although we didn&#8217;t need any fuel, we all needed to relieve ourselves and stock up on liquids and chocolate, the latter being a not-so-good idea.<br />
The moon was out that night, and was very bright. Unfortunately, it was hard to see it amongst all the trees. Dhar took over from Stefan, who took over navigating from me. I perched myself behind Stefan and peered out the windows to try and see anything in the dark. Through rare breaks in the trees I could see valleys, small mountain peaks, and the odd house. Otherwise, it was a series of black blobs.<br />
About 30 miles out of Cortez, we finally hit some excitement. As we came around a corner, we saw the flashing lights of a police car, in this case a Bronco. A cop had set up flares and positioned his car to prevent people from hitting a small landslide that had blocked part of the lane we were driving in. Dhar passed the cop slowly, allowing us to peer out at what we might have hit had the cop not been there to warn us. It was then that I realized just how dangerous that part of the trip had been. A heaving run-off could have dislodged a large rock, taking out the van with a single blow.<br />
The excitement didn&#8217;t end there however. About ten miles later, we caught a glimpse of the clean-up crew racing to the landslide. The first vehicle in line was a dumptruck with a plow on the front. I don&#8217;t know how fast he was going, but he came within a foot of hitting us, enough to make the four of us hold our breaths for a moment, then swear in unison that we weren&#8217;t all killed. Almost right behind the truck was a front-end loader that kept his distance.<br />
Almost as quickly as we entered the mountains, we exited them. Before us were the lights of Cortez, a city of only 7,300, but with enough lights to block out some of the stars in the sky. We pulled over just outside of the forests and gazed up for a few moments. Stefan remarked that Rainy River was much better, having no lights brighter than a 100 watt bulb. We piled back in and kept on driving.<br />
Route 145 ended at Highway 160, which coincidentally enough was where the KOA was located. We turned left, drove about 100 feet, and headed in for a late check-in. Stefan gathered up his wallet, bounded out the door, and went over to be frustrated by the late check-in booth. This was the first time we had ever checked in late, so this was a whole new experience for Stefan.<br />
He stared at the instructions for a few minutes, then came back for a pen he could write with. I never asked Stefan if he knew what on Earth he was doing, I figured he&#8217;d always answer &#8220;yes&#8221; regardless if he did or not. But it always took quite a while to get checked in every night we came in late. I don&#8217;t know if it was a result of him trying to figure out the cost when the discount was figured in or not, but nonetheless it took a while. Eventually, he returned with a map of the camp, indicating where we were to park.<br />
We drove almost all the way around the park before we finally found the right slot. Then we drove around to the other side so we could properly pull through. Once Dhar had us in place, I hopped out with the keys and proceeded to get us hooked up.<br />
Dinner had us in a heated discussion for about ten minutes before deciding on peanut butter and honey sandwiches. None of us were in the mood for cooking, and were all pretty tapped out from all the driving we had done that day. I figured in part the lack of will was due to us not being comfortable at the high altitude. During the day, we had traveled over 10,000 feet vertically (over 5,000 up and another 5,000 down) and all the pressure change had my ears nearly ringing.<br />
To go along with our light meal was the wine Stefan and Dhar had purchased in Woodland Park. Three large plastic cups were partially filled with the cheap spirits, whilst I drank of Coke. I normally don&#8217;t mind wine (at least not since I started drinking at New Year&#8217;s that year), but the kind I prefer starts at $20 a litre. The gallon they bought was around $4.<br />
The sandwiches filled a nutritional void that needed to be filled, we were quite satisfied that we could now go to sleep without a serious argument from our stomachs. Stefan and I were undoubtedly a different situation, but the both of us would agree that even a little food is much better than no food at all. One other advantage with making sandwiches was a minimalist clean up.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960423.227</strong><br />
<em>Day 3</em><br />
This can be easily defined as perhaps one of the most beautiful days in my life.We didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to go up Pikes Peak, the result of finally figuring out what the hell we were doing. We went to the Cave of the Winds, an uphill drive (and downhill) I&#8217;ll not soon forget.<br />
We spent almost as much time on the road as in Kansas, but the sights were much better.<br />
Finally arriving in Cortez, we scarfed down peanut butter sandwiches for &#8220;dinner&#8221; and everyone (sans moi) is getting drunk on cheap wine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was the alcoholic content of the wine, the change in altitude, or the phase of the moon but Rebecca got loony very quickly. By loony, I mean more or less drunk. Being the Observer, I know what drunk people are like &#8230; I&#8217;ve known hundreds, and this year became one of them. So I know drunk. Rebecca was not &#8220;hammered&#8221; or &#8220;blitzed&#8221;, but she was, to take a line from Pink Floyd, comfortably numb.<br />
The wine didn&#8217;t seem to affect Stefan or Dhar much, except the slight redness in Dhar&#8217;s nose, so we concentrated on Rebecca&#8217;s antics. When that got boring (right about when the bottle was emptied), we began talking about whatever came to mind.<br />
Take a set of young adults, give them alcohol, put them in a confined space and 99 times out of 100, they&#8217;ll end up on sex. Not necessarily participate in the act of sex (although that is a possibility), but discussion almost invariably leads to sex. I really have to wonder why psychologists have never studied this. Is it a preoccupation? I know it is with men (being one, I feel I can speak confidently for the whole), but is it with women? I can&#8217;t say Rebecca speaks for the whole of women, since she&#8217;s preoccupied with it for different reasons &#8212; she already has had kids, and is a sex expert in her line of employment.<br />
Nevertheless, we ended up talking about sex. Specifics I cannot recall, since I was not only fairly tired, but the number of such discussions I have had prior and since that night have irreversibly garbled what memory of particulars I had of that evening.<br />
What I do remember of that evening was Dhar&#8217;s silence. Rebecca did most of the talking, Stefan and I accounting for about only half the discussion. It was then that I realized that Dhar was insecure about the subject. At first I thought he was just a kindred spirit to myself &#8212; too shy to ask, too desperate to get it. But his general lack of contribution, even when prompted, told a totally different story. Sex was not quite taboo, but it was something very private to him and not open for discussion at any time. I sympathized with him, having to listen to the three of us babble away while he patiently sat there and waited for us to finish.<br />
Somewhere close to 01:00, we decided that sleep was not a bad idea. The plans for the following day were to visit the Four Corners and the Grand Canyon, getting into Las Vegas sometime around 20:00 that night.<br />
I pulled my bed out as usual, but Dhar decided that he was going to try a different way of sleeping, and simply tilted his chair back. Dhar spent the night sleeping in a reclined seated position, facing the rear of the van. It didn&#8217;t stop him snoring through, he began than less than five minutes after the lights went out&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The rain came down so heavily I have yet to see an adjective to properly describe it &#8212; &#8220;sheets&#8221; is not hard enough, and &#8220;Niagara Falls&#8221; is far too much. Somewhere in between will have to suffice until a proper word can be agreed upon. Needless to say though, Rebecca was none too thrilled with having to drive through it.<br />
I personally believe that any person, regardless of sex or race, is capable of anything when dead set on doing something &#8230; except for a few cases. This happened to be one of them. Rebecca was visibly nervous about driving the van, even more so when visibility dropped to less than 100 feet. I know that when I get stuck with something potentially dangerous, and someone more capable than I is nearby, I ask for help. I also know that it&#8217;s the strong people who seldom ask for help. Intelligence be damned &#8212; pride is a hard thing to overcome. (I&#8217;ll dispense with the Pulp Fiction quotes.)<br />
Rebecca pulled off I-70 and into a closed gas station, amidst a flurry of road reconstruction. (The construction theme was one we would see many times throughout our trip, this was the first major encounter for us.) Unlike others that would follow, this didn&#8217;t greatly affect our travel.<br />
Under the canopy of the gas bar, Rebecca relinquished her seat to Dhar. He promptly set about getting the mirrors exactly where he wanted them. This gave us all a chance to get up for a moment and stretch out before getting back onto the Interstate. A moment later, Dhar pulled out from under the canopy, drove out into the chewed-up road, up the on-ramp and back onto the highway. And into a storm the likes of which I had never seen before.<br />
The rain we encountered briefly with Rebecca had been hard and steady &#8230; but short. Almost as soon as we had pulled off the highway, the rain had slowed to a trickle. None of us chose to see this as a sign, or at least if anyone did they kept quiet. When Dhar took over driving, we entered a four hour maelstrom of water, lightning, and wind.<br />
(Author&#8217;s note: About a week after we returned home, the mid-west, including a good portion of the states we drove through, experienced serious flooding as a result of heavier-than-usual rainfall.)<br />
Less than a half hour after leaving the gas station, the wind began to pick up again. This disappointed us because we firmly believed that the head-wind we had coming from Oakville had given us our less-than-excellent gas mileage. It also made driving more difficult. But the wind wasn&#8217;t the result of the heating of the Earth&#8217;s surface, as had the wind some twelve hours earlier &#8212; this wind was the result of a cold front. A cold front that brought us the worst storm I have ever seen.<br />
The rain started coming down shortly after the wind started. Every ten minutes the rain&#8217;s volume doubled, likening the downpour more to Niagara Falls than a sheet. Even with the windshield wipers on full we could hardly see. For a short period, Dhar reduced speed to keep us from hitting something or sliding off the road.<br />
Flashes in the distance continued to come closer and closer, until we were surrounded by lightening. The sight was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I have loved lightning storms for many years now (despite that when I was a kid, I was scared to death of them), and although we saw only a few truly spectacular bolts, those that we did see ranked among the most spectacular of my life. Not long after we entered the lightning portion of the storm, Stefan decided to make me feel like a little kid again.<br />
&#8220;Is this van shielded?&#8221; he asked. Being a non-engineer, and being rather uneducated in vehicular safety outside of seat belts, airbags, anti-lock brakes, and drink holders big enough to hold a jumbo Slurpee(r), I had no idea what Stefan was referring to. He explained that most cars (and by most, I am referring to any car you can buy from a dealer) are electrically shielded. If struck by lightning on the roof, the charge is carried down the walls and out through the bottom simply by the way the car is constructed.<br />
As Stefan was quick to point out, the roof of the van wasn&#8217;t metal &#8212; it was fibreglass and plastic. The last time I checked, the only thing you could conduct with fibreglass or plastic was an orchestra. I knew there was a wrap-around antenna for the television, but I didn&#8217;t know if Home &amp; Park had installed a grounding strip to draw any outside electrical current into the metal body of the van. I had a vision of a bolt suddenly bursting through the ceiling and vapourizing us where we sat. I tried to think of any recorded lightning strikes on a moving motorhome &#8230; and drew a blank. Nevertheless, I quickly found myself wondering when we would be exiting the storm.<br />
Stefan, now having successfully frightened me into staying awake watching for lightning strikes, wandered to the rear bed where Rebecca was already asleep. Rebecca got more sleep during the trip than Stefan, Dhar and I combined. I&#8217;m not complaining, I think she deserved it &#8212; mothers with small children get so little sleep. I know my parents took every opportunity to get away from my sister and I to relax, so I could hold nothing against Stefan and Rebecca.<br />
Dhar continued to drive through the night, wrestling the wind and the rain. The two of us talked, played music, and stared out into the lonely stormy night. Every so often we were passed by a semi-trailer driving about ten miles an hour faster than us, which naturally made Dhar and I a little leery of sliding off the road into a fiery death. Appealing as it may be to some, we had intentions of making it at least as far as Vegas before committing ritual suicide<br />
Over the course of several hours, the storm lessened in strength until at last all that was left was an overcast sky. At around 05:30, we entered Kansas City Limits. I should also point out at this time that we had already crossed into the Central Time Zone, and our clock was dutifully adjusted whenever we crossed any time zone.<br />
The amount of traffic in Kansas City was negligible, rush hour wasn&#8217;t for at least another hour. And this time we would hit rush hour &#8212; it was now Monday morning. Soon we were skirting in and around the overpasses and underpasses that made up the downtown core of Kansas City. Several times the wind blew us around, and scared the hell out of Dhar because he wasn&#8217;t ready. In a little more than a half hour, the city limits were again approaching, as was a minor change in our roadway status.<br />
We entered onto the Kansas Turnpike. Unfortunately for us, this was a toll road. Doubly unfortunate, there was no way to avoid it (if we had tried to stay on I-70, we would&#8217;ve ended up in Wichita). For me, this was the first time I had ever been on a toll road where you paid to get off, not on. At the first booth, we took a ticket from the gate attendant, and proceeded on our way. Almost immediately, Dhar noted that we couldn&#8217;t exceed the speed limit here, since the attendant at the other end would know if we tried to go too fast by the amount of time it took us to get there.<br />
By this time the sun had begun to rise, and the two in the back slowly began to wake up. Stefan had mentioned shortly before joining Rebecca that he wanted to see the sun rise that morning, and left orders with us to wake him at that time. As it turned out, he awoke before the sun could really be seen (the clouds remained for quite some time that morning, and didn&#8217;t burn off until after noon.)<br />
Stefan, becoming more aware of where he was, suddenly realized that he&#8217;d been there before several years previous. He remembered rest stops in the middle of the Turnpike. As he explained it, somewhere along the turnpike was a restaurant and a gas station &#8230; in the middle of the road. Odd, perhaps, but it didn&#8217;t change the fact that while Stefan remembered that they existed, he couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where.<br />
As the ambient daylight increased, our fuel supply decreased, both automobile and human alike. Then the blue and white sign appeared before us: Rest Stop, 1 Mile. Another sign soon indicated that we would exit not on the right side of the road, but the left. Stefan&#8217;s memory seemed quite accurate, if incomplete.<br />
Once again I will state for the record that while Americans can build the best highways in the world, they have no concept of merging. Putting on-ramps and off-ramps along the faster lanes is just poor planning, regardless of efficiency. Unless you happen to drive a vehicle with a turbo-charged V12, or happen to have solid-rocket boosters strapped to the side of your minivan, you&#8217;re potential roadkill. The length of American on-ramps and off-ramps is also horrible, quite often being less than 20 feet. I know of few vehicles that can accelerate to 60 miles per hour in less than 20 feet. The Behemoth isn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
We pulled off the road shortly after 06:30, and pulled up to a Hardee&#8217;s, the American equivalent to Harvey&#8217;s. We were hungry, but the foremost thing on my mind was using the toilet. I opened my door, and my skin immediately started crawling, desperately trying to get away from the cold. We had started our travel south, but the warm weather we so desperately wanted was not yet to be felt. I quickly jogged around the side of the beige brick building, and found the entrance.<br />
I quickly realized that this was a truck stop. I define a truck stop as any restaurant that wouldn&#8217;t accommodate most families. This one wouldn&#8217;t accommodate most families of roaches, let alone me. I quickly entered the Men&#8217;s Room and even more swiftly, emptied my bladder into the first available urinal. Several large, mostly overweight men were milling about, in various states of relieving themselves. I opted not to start a conversation.<br />
A moment later, I was back at the van, warning the rest not to eat there, adding that the restrooms should be considered &#8220;last resorts&#8221;. I expected more opposition, but I guess there&#8217;s always a good solid line between food and sanitation. Hey, we might have been university students, but even we had our limits.<br />
But the gas was cheap, so we took the opportunity to fill our tank. The wind was chilly, maybe 10 degrees Celsius, my hands nearly froze to the pump handle. Wearing shorts probably didn&#8217;t help matters much.<br />
I took over driving again, feeling fairly awake considering my lack of sleep. I assumed that my excitement to be someplace new was enough to keep me going. (That, and the rude awakening from running around in the cold while wearing shorts.) I honestly wondered how long I could keep it up. Pulling out into the turnpike turned out not to be too severe a problem &#8212; there was no-one else driving that early on a Monday morning.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we found ourselves at the end of our jaunt along the Kansas Turnpike, as it began to arc towards Wichita, which was away from our planned route (kind of like Syndey, Australia is out of the way of Paris, France). We paid our $1.75 toll and returned to the I-70. We drove for only a couple hours before hunger got the better of Dhar, Rebecca, and myself. Despite his proclaimed starvation at the Hardee&#8217;s earlier, sleep overcame the walking stomach (Stefan), and he crawled back into bed. The rest of us kept watch for a restaurant.<br />
Finding restaurants along Interstates turned out to be a relatively easy prospect. Whenever an exit sign appeared, it was usually followed by three more signs. Each of these signs indicated which gas stations, hotels, and restaurants were available at each exit. This, for us, was a big benefit because it kept us from having to get off the Interstate and wander around needlessly wasting gas. So whenever we got mildly esurient, we kept watch for restaurant signs and bickered about which places we weren&#8217;t going.<br />
With Stefan mostly asleep, we took the first exit the three of us agreed on &#8212; Perkins. It wasn&#8217;t Rebecca&#8217;s first choice for fine eating &#8212; nor anyone else with a heartbeat &#8212; several times she had mentioned that Perkins was prone to bad food and horrible service. This was her experience. I, on the other hand, had never been to a Perkins before and had no qualms about giving it a try.<br />
Rebecca, Dhar, and I got ready to go for breakfast while Stefan steadfastly stuck to staying in bed. It was ironic that the human garborator, who only an hour or two earlier had professed his undying need for nourishment, was in fact &#8220;too tired&#8221; to eat. Having formerly held a similar title in eating, I knew that there was no such thing as &#8220;too tired&#8221;. But I wasn&#8217;t about to try and move him. I figured we&#8217;d just leave him to his stomach.<br />
The Perkins was nearly empty. This I found somewhat surprising considering that it was now past seven o&#8217;clock and most people would be ready to eat. Then again, it was a Monday morning in a small town whose only link to the outside world seemed to be through the Interstate. What appeared to be the main road ran under the Interstate, and every building of significance seemed to be within a mile of the Interstate, including the Perkins.<br />
The waitress appeared almost as soon as we had sat down. We ordered up two coffees and one orange juice (I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, drink coffee &#8230; I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;d be like wired on that much caffeine). Rebecca chided me for not having coffee, proclaiming that I should &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; and be a little more adventurous (I got that a lot during the trip &#8212; I&#8217;m a conservative in rebel clothing). I didn&#8217;t want to get addicted to coffee, I have found dependence to something during long journeys can be distracting. As it stands, I actually considered having coffee after a taste of my orange juice &#8230; rather, my glass of Tang.<br />
Almost as soon as the waitress disappeared with our drink order, Stefan stumbled in through the entrance. We knew that he&#8217;d be along sooner or later, you simply can&#8217;t sleep when your stomach wants to be satisfied. He sat down across from Rebecca and announced wearily that he was hungry. We restrained the urge to snicker. When the waitress returned a moment later with our beverages, she was visibly confused, wondering if she had accidentally missed a person the first time. Stefan smiled sheepishly and ordered a coffee.<br />
As for the food, I chose a decidedly large breakfast of a three-egg omelette, pancakes, hash browns, and sausages. By the time I finished eating, I was quite satisfied. I felt ready to tackle another large chunk of America. Stefan&#8217;s and Dhar&#8217;s means were variants on each other, and of equivalent size to mine. Only Rebecca ate less &#8230; and even then, not by much. Stefan woke up the more he ate, by the end of breakfast he looked completely alert. However, that might have been due to the coffee&#8230;<br />
Stefan picked up the tab for breakfast that morning, but we added it to the log of expenses so we could figure out how much we owed him at a later date. This was a pattern that would continue for the rest of the trip. It make figuring out bills a lot easier.<br />
Outside the wind was still blowing hard and cold, I made a quick return to the van to get it started. Rebecca made mention of stopping somewhere for food and drinks, but I was more intent on getting back on the road. I figured that we&#8217;d find what we wanted at the next gas stop.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960422.075</strong><br />
<em>Day 2</em><br />
Despite a storm of biblical proportions, we&#8217;ve made it into Kansas. I&#8217;m surviving on about 2 hours sleep &#8230; does it ever hurt.We&#8217;ve run into our first major argument &#8211; namely where the hell this damn trip is going. I personally want to hit all the places in our itinerary, but Stefan seems to want to keep us in the Colorado Springs area. I was planning only on about 2 days, but now that&#8217;s up to 4 &#8230; we&#8217;ll figure this out somewhere.<br />
Becka survived her initial stint of about 10 miles at the helm, but she caught the very front of that storm, and we moved Dhar in instead. 9 hours to our last stop.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus we truly began our nine hour odyssey across Kansas. Of all the states we visited, Kansas would be the last state I would ever settle in. It&#8217;s too flat. The Interstates go on for hundreds of miles in straight lines. There&#8217;s nothing to see for hours on end. The distance markers never seem to change. (If you haven&#8217;t already gotten the picture, it&#8217;s unbelievably boring.)<br />
Somewhere in the galactic schemes of things, Kansas has become the place where time and space have no meaning. You can exist there for hours and get nowhere. True believers think that all the strangeness exists in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. No-one has even considered Kansas. No-one knows that its original settlers still live there, not having ever grown old. It&#8217;s a little known fact, and Kansasites want to keep it that way &#8212; waiting for the day their people come from Borotron to capture the Earth. Mark my words: when aliens take over the Earth, their capital will be in Kansas!<br />
Boredom, thy name is Kansas. I was so strung out from crossing the Sunflower State, when I saw a bumpiness just on the horizon, I swore they were mountains. Everyone else was telling me they were just clouds, but I didn&#8217;t want to believe it. By this time Stefan had assumed the driver&#8217;s position, and I became obsessed with leaving the wide open spaces for something a little more feature-ridden. To my despair, the bumpiness turned out to be only clouds forming into strange shapes, that I wrongly assumed could have only been formed near large formations in the Earth. I never did find out how those clouds formed, but we didn&#8217;t see any real mountains until a few hours later.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Kansas wasn&#8217;t the first mostly flat place I&#8217;d been. My mother was born in Saskatchewan, which is almost in the middle of the great Canadian plains. The plains I knew best were the ones from Saskatoon to Prince Albert, a distance of about 200 kilometres. There the land is reasonably flat, but with a fair number of rolling hills and the odd valley or two. My mother testifies that the southern portion of Saskatchewan, out by Regina, is flatter than the proverbial pancake. Having never been further south than Saskatoon, I didn&#8217;t know. Kansas is awfully like the southern portion of Saskatchewan, only flatter.<br />
It was while we drove endlessly through Kansas that I first heard of &#8220;highway hypnosis&#8221;. I learned that during long trips, especially in places with nothing to look at except straight lines with few curves (I won&#8217;t mention any six-letter mid-American agricultural states), you tend to start not noticing things. At first you miss the odd road sign. Then it&#8217;s how fast you&#8217;re going. Pretty soon you don&#8217;t notice the semi-trailers carrying large red farm equipment heading directly for you because you drifted over into a lane you didn&#8217;t know existed. None of us seemed to succumb to the potentially fatal problem, but then again we tended to talk too much while we were driving.<br />
After what seemed like an eternity, our first sign of progress appeared: the Kansas / Colorado border. We felt like celebrating, like we had accomplished some great feat of endurance that no human had ever before had done. But even from that point, we still had another hour and a half before we would leave the I-70 and take State Highway 24 to Colorado Springs. So we settled for a rousing rendition of: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re in Kansas anymore!&#8221;<br />
As we rounded a large rain storm just to the south of us, I caught a glimpse of my first mountain. Until then the largest mountain I had ever seen were in the Laurentian Mountains in Quebec, part of the Appalachian Mountains. Much older than the Rocky Mountains, the Laurentians are also much shorter. Stefan was quick to note that although spectacular, even the mountains in the Colorado section of the Rocky Mountains were small when compared to the ones in British Columbia and Alberta.<br />
Before we knew it the land was bubbling with mountains, most of them capped with high snowy peaks. Some a leftover of a strong winter, the rest due to their height. Never before had I imagined such a sight. Sure, I had read literally hundreds of books and articles on mountains and mountain ranges, and seen countless feet of footage in movies and documentaries, but nothing in the world could have prepared me for the sight I beheld.<br />
And nothing could have prepared us for what still lay on the ground. Snow. Winter in most of Canada that year had been particularly long and harsh. Part of the trip, for me at least, was to escape the winter for at least two weeks. The snow had melted in Canada some two to three weeks earlier. But in Colorado, patches of snow still clung to the ground like a frightened child to its mother. I suddenly felt a little depressed. Long winters tend to do that to a person.<br />
The van was beginning to act rather strangely, even for a vehicle that hadn&#8217;t been fully broken in yet. I assumed the problems stemmed from our altitude. Just from entering Colorado alone, we had climbed to an altitude of some 4,000 feet above sea level. Oakville, by comparison, is only about 300 to 400 feet above sea level. The higher we climbed, the less air there was for the van to use. Even I started feeling a little light-headed after a while.<br />
When we reached the junction of the I-70 and Highway 24, we quickly found ourselves traveling through the quaint little town of Limon, elevation 5,360 feet. I wondered how strange we looked to the locals, seeing a large white van-cum-motorhome speeding through small 4&#215;4&#8217;s, pickups and cars. The roads weren&#8217;t as nice as the Interstate, but as Stefan had been waiting to see, the roads were pink.<br />
Yes, pink.<br />
In most places around America, the roads are made with black sand. Don&#8217;t ask me why, this is just the way of things. But believe it or not, black sand is expensive, at least to carry to places like Colorado. There they made use of local materials instead. And in Colorado, not to forget Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, some of the readily available materials, namely the sand, is red. The result is pink roads.<br />
And you thought Highway Hypnosis on black roads was troublesome.<br />
The question of residence was raised not long after we entered Colorado. We still hadn&#8217;t decided where we were going to be spending the night. A partial decision had been made some time earlier that we stay at a campsite, but which one was still up in the air. Thus we dove into the RV Campsite book that my father had received from the Mobilife, who had sold us the Behemoth.<br />
The Campsite book is concise and complete, listing every single campsite across North America. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s also several inches thick. After several debates on the services we wanted to have available, we decided on the Garden of the Gods campground, which was on the opposite side of Colorado Springs to the side we were entering. I wasn&#8217;t too thrilled with having to cross an unknown city, but for a pool and hot-tub, it seemed like a good idea. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Colorado Springs city limits came into view.<br />
Under most situations, the navigator doesn&#8217;t do very much. When passing through a city, the navigator makes sure the driver doesn&#8217;t accidentally take an off-ramp into the downtown core, or get onto a different highway that takes us to Timbuktu. And that&#8217;s in the worst of conditions, they last usually no more than a half hour. (At night, the navigator is also helpful at keeping the driver awake.) When we actually get off into a city, that&#8217;s a whole other issue.<br />
I was pulling navigator duty when we arrived in Colorado Springs, somewhere around 17:30 in the afternoon. Unfortunately, this meant rush hour. So far, we had managed to avoid any major form of vehicular traffic, something we liked. It kept our travel time lower, not to mention our stress levels. But it had become time to face the music and get stuck in the thick of things.<br />
We got off Highway 24 onto Power Boulevard and headed south to Fountain Street. The idea was to get us to the other side of the city as easily as possible so we could find Colorado Avenue. This, according to the Campsite book, was where we would find the Garden of the Gods campground. What the Campsite book didn&#8217;t tell us was how hard it would be to get across the city with our asses still attached to our rear ends.<br />
We barely missed going the wrong way at an intersection and almost landed on I-25. As it turns out, that in itself wouldn&#8217;t have been so bad, but I would&#8217;ve had to figure out which exit to then get off. (No, I&#8217;m not that bad a navigator, but it was first proverbial kick at the cat, so I wasn&#8217;t entirely confident in my abilities at that point.) Eventually we made it over to Cascade Avenue, which we would then take up to Colorado.<br />
We noticed something about Colorado Springs almost immediately &#8212; it was clean. Not just a general lack of garbage in the streets, but an overall appearance of cleanliness. There was no dirt on the roads, the grass was cut, there seemed to be no pollution &#8230; even the trees seemed to be polished. It was like driving through a Disney-created city. Disturbing is too soft a term to describe what I felt, and frightened is too harsh.<br />
Many Americans, when they come to Canada, marvel at how clean our cities are. After many years, many Canadians would probably beg to differ with those Americans. Many of these Canadians, however, haven&#8217;t been to the United States. For a Canadian, then, to call an American city &#8220;clean&#8221; is nothing short of high praise. Colorado Springs was nearly spotless. To this date, I still proclaim that there are two cities in the United States I would move to. My first choice is Colorado Springs. (My second choice is New Orleans, which has got to be Colorado Springs&#8217; antithesis. Go figure that one, eh?)<br />
We debated on the reason for the cleanliness. One of our conclusions was that Colorado Springs is a military city, containing both Fort Carson and the Peterson Air Force Base. All the military spending might spill into the city, either allowing or forcing the city to keep itself clean. Another reason that we either initially ignored or forgot was that Colorado Springs is also a large tourist attraction in that part of Colorado. The tourist dollars (a few of which we contributed) simply allow a solid cleanup effort.<br />
But even clean cities still have rush hour traffic. (Though I&#8217;d forgotten about that?) I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to make of it then, and I&#8217;m still not sure what to make of it now. The veteran of some of the worst traffic jams Toronto has to offer, I&#8217;ve seen (and experienced) some of the worst rush hours in North America. Colorado Springs, population 247,700, is the only major point of population in its area &#8212; rush hour probably only lasts an hour, if that. This I determined from sitting at the corner of Cascade and Colorado.<br />
It looked like the intersection of any non-descript small city. No buildings nearby over three stories, lots of trees, lampposts that were at least 15 years old (not that it&#8217;s a bad thing, they added a lot of character), meridians down the middle complete with trees and grass &#8230; it was very picturesque. It was also full of cars.<br />
We were in the left turning lane, the sole vehicle trying to turn from Cascade onto Colorado. We waited patiently for all the traffic in the on-coming lane to disperse so we could continue on our way. But one of the vehicles in the on-coming lane was a semi-trailer with a flatbed. He was way too close to the edge of the road. And apparently not too experienced with going around corners.<br />
Trucks like that normally take very wide right hand turns, mostly to compensate for the length and inflexibility of the trailers. Remember I said &#8220;normally&#8221;. This guy either got stuck in the rightmost lane, or was a beginner and no idea what he was doing. He started turning left and quickly found that he was going to take out the traffic light control box if he continued forward. He was blocking our exit, and the lights were about to change. Rebecca, Dhar, and I quickly urged Stefan to back up before we started blocking traffic. The urge was particularly strong because we hadn&#8217;t anyone else behind us at the time, and I didn&#8217;t know how long that would last.<br />
We had backed up just as the lights changed. The truck however, was still stuck in the intersection, waiting for the traffic to disperse in the lanes in front of him so he could pull forward more before turning. This caused the traffic wanting to cross the intersection to have to wait until the truck was gone before they could go. I began to wonder how many lights we were going to have to sit through to see this problem resolved. By the end of the light cycle, the truck was driving off, and the cars on Colorado were crossing Cascade. But with no advanced green or an arrow to let us go, we had to wait for traffic on Cascade to filter out.<br />
But soon we were on Colorado heading east, towards what we hoped would be our campground. It was then I found out an interesting thing about Colorado &#8212; the roads like to move around. It turned out that somewhere along the line, Colorado shifted to the next road north. We were back on Highway 24. And surrounded by morons, like the woman in a teeny tiny little car who decided she would pass us on our right as Stefan began to make a lane change. She even had the gall to honk at us like it was our fault. Some drivers should just be run off the road and be taken out of everyone&#8217;s misery. But I will say one thing about American drivers: on a whole, they have far more common sense than most of the drivers in Southern Ontario.<br />
We passed under the overpass for the I-25 and quickly came to another lighted intersection, just changing red in our direction. Dhar immediately noticed a series of cooling towers to our left. Our initial impulse was a nuclear power station, prompting Dhar to sing (to the tune of The Flintstones theme): &#8220;Simpson &#8230; Homer Simpson &#8230; he&#8217;s the greatest man in history! From the &#8230; town of Springfield &#8230; he&#8217;s about to hit a chestnut tree!&#8221; Like I already said, Dhar and I drove Rebecca crazy with our Simpson&#8217;s references.<br />
I dismissed the notion of a nuclear power plant being so deep inside a city, and so far away from a major source of water. I guessed it was a power plant fired by natural resources (like coal), or even perhaps a geothermal station (about which I was somewhat doubtful, as I didn&#8217;t know of any geothermal activity in that area). Either way, we didn&#8217;t get too long a look as the light soon changed and we drove on through.<br />
In Colorado Springs, there is at least one intelligent city road planner. This was the person who saw it necessary to install small junctions from Highway 24 across a small valley to Colorado Avenue. A good thing, otherwise we&#8217;d have driven into the mountains, which was where we didn&#8217;t want to go. This got us closer to where we wanted to be, but even then we weren&#8217;t certain. Tensions grew and tempers shortened as each person tried to give directions to the campground we couldn&#8217;t find.<br />
One thing I should also note about navigators &#8212; only one navigator should be allowed to navigate, otherwise confusion seems to reign supreme. The Campsite book was in the possession of Dhar and Rebecca, neither of whom were the current navigator, both of whom read out differing accounts of the same directions to take us to Garden of the Gods, and both became more irritated when Stefan was unable to comply with their instructions. Stefan, in a vain attempt to figure out what both of them were trying to say, drove up Colorado until we entered Manitou, a suburb of Colorado Springs. At this point, we all agreed that we&#8217;d gone too far.<br />
Frustrated, we turned around and came back, still not sure of where we were going. Stefan decided to take things into his own hands and darted up Garden of the Gods Road, thinking that maybe the campground might be located on that street. At the time, the idea couldn&#8217;t have hurt &#8212; eight eyes all missed the entrance twice.<br />
But up Garden of the Gods Road, we found the road&#8217;s namesake &#8212; Garden of the Gods Park. I had briefly read something about the park in the AAA TourBook (r) for Colorado / Utah, and it seemed like an interesting place to visit. I hadn&#8217;t expected to see it on our arrival, but the break was more than welcome &#8230; especially since we were probably only minutes from starting to scream and yell at each other.<br />
Stefan drove up the winding road, walls of trees and rock sprouted on either side of a the road for a moment, then gave way to a large reddish ochre rock wall as the road turned. In the wall was a large V-shaped crack running vertically, and at the top of the crack was a large boulder of the same colour as the wall upon which it sat. That alone wasn&#8217;t as impressive as what lay around another turn.<br />
Immediately I understood the reason why someone had named the park &#8220;Garden of the Gods&#8221;. The portion we could see was a shallow bowl-shaped valley, surrounded by large mountains of the same reddish-ochre rock. The mountains were inconsequential when compared to the neighbouring Rockies, but the Rockies lacked the bold colour.<br />
The rocks were likely a sandstone, formed many millions of years ago when the Colorado Springs area sat under 50 feet of ocean. Over the years, the water level dropped and the land level rose, exposing the layer of stone to the elements. The wind and the rain carved the rock into a softly flowing, sweeping landscape. The valley that was left eventually filled with deep green foliage in the forms of shrubs and small trees. It could have been the playground for Zeus&#8217; children, for Venus&#8217; lovers, for Diana&#8217;s prey. It was now the plaything of the more outgoing members of the human race.<br />
Stefan pulled to the side of the road, mostly on our urging, Dhar and I immediately sprinted outside and started to take pictures. I took both my large 35 mm camera, and a small disposable Kodak panoramic camera I had bought just before we left. Alas, the pictures I took just didn&#8217;t bring out the vibrant hues that seemed to spill from every point in my view (even though I was using Kodak film, which tends more towards reds and oranges.)<br />
Dhar took a few pictures as did Stefan or Rebecca, depending on which one was using the camera at the time. We spend only a few minutes basking in the splendour before climbing back in the van, and proceeding down the road to try and find the campground.<br />
We drove slowly, partly so we could see all the scenery, partly because there were many pedestrians, bicyclists, and much smaller vehicles driving about, and Stefan probably wasn&#8217;t in the mood to crush anyone at the time. After rounding several corners, we stumbled across the General Store and Gift Shop, which seemed like an interesting place to stop temporarily and get directions to figure out where we were going. I also wanted to get more film.<br />
The store looked like a reconstruction of a stereotypical store one would expect in a stereotypical Western movie, with the exception of the stereotypical town drunk, and that the store was only a single-level establishment. Out front was a robotic cowboy, complete with poorly moving jaw and a computer-synthesized voice straight out of the Commodore 64 version of Impossible Mission by Epyx. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh not only at the antiquated technology as I walked by, but also at the other tourists who were taking pictures of it.<br />
This was one of few trips I have ever been on, in fact it may be the only trip, that I completely acknowledged the fact that I was a tourist. Many times I have gone out of my way to blend in, as not to look &#8220;dorky&#8221; or end up &#8220;sticking out like a sore thumb&#8221;. This usually occurs when I walk around with my camera slung around my neck. But this trip was different &#8212; I felt like acting like a tourist. Why? Just in case I was asked where I was from. That way I could tell people how much snow there was in Canada, that I have to take a dog sled team to work everyday, and that during certain times of the year we pay for things with ice because it&#8217;s too cold to carry money with you.<br />
And so we entered our first tourist trap of the trip. Inside was every single tacky souvenir you could possibly image &#8230; and a few you couldn&#8217;t. We spent a few minutes wandering around, seeing what annoying little gifts we would have to avoid buying over the next few days we were in Colorado. I bought another roll of film, and Stefan obtained directions to the campground.<br />
Unluckily for us, the directions we received were even more cryptic than the ones we had tried to follow about a half hour earlier. But part of the instructions we understood &#8212; go to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. This sounded at least partially feasible. So we all climbed back in the van again, and continued to follow the one-way road out towards what I believe to be 30th Street, which had the east entrance to the park. Just across the road was the Visitor&#8217;s Center.<br />
After a quick bought of indecision by yours truly on which entrance to use (there were two), Stefan drove south about 100 feet and turned into the driveway. He continued through the almost completely empty parking lot, and pulled up front the sliding glass doors. Two people walked in front of us as we pulled up, a man and a cigarette-smoking woman. Both of us seemed to cast a stare that said: &#8220;What the hell are you doing here?&#8221;<br />
The glance was in a way justified, the Center had closed, though when it had closed was indeterminable without getting out of the van, which none of us were really too keep about. We sighed, Stefan backed up and turned around, and then headed down 30th Street towards Colorado Avenue again.<br />
Part way down, he turned at a side street and headed west to another side road. Stefan barely slowed at the stop sign and turned south again. This road was interesting, as it was divided by a creek running down the centre of the road. The road was divided by about 20 to 30 feet, where it formed a concrete and stone &#8216;V&#8217;. Every so often, a small concrete bridge linked one side of the road with the other. The creek emptied into the valley that separated Highway 24 and Colorado Avenue.<br />
When we reached Colorado Avenue again, Stefan turned right and headed west one more time. Almost immediately the confusion we had tried to lose in the Garden of the Gods caught up, and we started arguing again. At a slight bend in the road a small road jutted to one side, which for us was going perfectly straight. I suggested to Stefan that he pull onto it for a moment until we figure out where we were. It didn&#8217;t seem to help much. But just as we were about to turn back to Colorado, a well-hidden sign right in front of us read: Garden of the Gods Campground. We let out a quiet cheer as Stefan pulled into the lot.<br />
The only campgrounds I had ever been to before were for tents. I hadn&#8217;t seen an RV park before, and wasn&#8217;t immediately impressed with Garden of the Gods. In hindsight, it was actually quite a nice looking place. Except for one small detail &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t quite open yet. As it turned out, we were the pre-season tourists.<br />
The main office was closed, but we were met by whom I assumed to be the caretaker. He explained the water and electrical hook-ups were available, but none of the facilities were really open yet, and only the toilets were usable &#8212; the showers wouldn&#8217;t be ready for a couple weeks. I was past the point of giving a shit, and was interested in getting hooked up for the night, eating, and getting some sleep. Both Stefan and Rebecca wanted a hot tub to relax in for a while.<br />
The caretaker suggested that we check out another campground just down the road which was listed as a &#8220;Good Sam Park&#8221; (whatever that&#8217;s supposed to mean). So we thanked the caretaker, suggested that we might be back (which I took to mean that only if the world came to an end and we felt the need to end our lives in a rush), climbed back into the van and left the campground.<br />
The Good Sam park wasn&#8217;t any better. It was much smaller, and it&#8217;s facilities weren&#8217;t open either &#8230; what few it had. We didn&#8217;t have to get out of the van before we decided that we weren&#8217;t staying there either. Stefan drove across a small bridge from Colorado Avenue, stopped briefly in front of the main office, drove around back, round to the front, across the bridge and back onto Colorado.<br />
Dhar started whining. He wanted a hotel room. Dhar was housebroken &#8212; he had never been camping before, in any form. An RV is a luxury for a camper, and for Dhar this was roughing it. Before the trip, he hadn&#8217;t had Kraft Dinner (or facsimiles), or anything else that seemed to go hand-in-hand with camping. I was surprised that he even had a sleeping bag.<br />
Everywhere along Colorado were hotels and motels advertising rooms for $30 or less. Stefan, Rebecca, and I flatly refused to give in so easily, opting to try and find the KOA that Stefan knew was in the area and settle in for the night. The only problem we seemed to have was finding the KOA. None of the maps we had seemed to indicate the exit we had to take to find the KOA, and while the instructions in the RV Campsite book were fairly good, Stefan&#8217;s last memory of trying to find the campsite was rough.<br />
Apparently, when Stefan had been in Colorado Springs the first time, he had stayed at the Kampgrounds Of America (KOA) in the south side of the city. But as he had tried to find it, the driver took a wrong turn, and landed in Fort Carson&#8217;s Tank Proving Grounds. Normally, you can&#8217;t miss this area, as the roads are lined with tank crossing signs.<br />
The first idea was to find the AAA office. Stefan knew that there we could get a KOA book, which would have much better directions to our destination. I guided Stefan onto the I-25 south, which would take us back to Highway 24 east. That in turn to Academy Boulevard, somewhere on which was supposed to be the AAA office.<br />
The route back to Academy Rd. was a little on the nerve-wracking side, having more cut-offs and merging streets than we could really handle after driving so long without a break, and arguing over where we were going. This culminated with me jumping the gun and leading Stefan up the wrong road. We still got to Academy, but we lost the advantage of a light to turn easily onto Academy. But Stefan was undaunted, and executed a perfect left turn, crossing two lanes of traffic and merging with a large flow of cars from the south.<br />
For five minutes we traveled north until we were where one of the maps said the AAA should be. However the map we were using was incorrect. The office was in reality in the north end of the city. This didn&#8217;t stop us from going through several of the strip malls, searching for the illusive AAA sign. After keeping this up for about ten minutes, and several &#8220;let&#8217;s try the next mall, just in case&#8221;, we gave up. Academy Road, alas, wasn&#8217;t there any longer &#8212; the road had split into one-way roads, with another strip mall in the middle.<br />
Stefan continued to mutter under his breath as he negotiated his way into the southbound lanes. While Stefan muttered, I looked through several maps and tried to piece together enough information to figure out where we were going. It took a few minutes, but I eventually determined where we needed to be. No-one said a word of hope or encouragement, partially due to lack of energy, partially in case I was wrong.<br />
As per my instructions, Stefan headed south towards I-25. Rebecca and Dhar pointed out all the liquor stores that seemed to line Academy. This started a long running joke about liquor: &#8220;But you don&#8217;t even know her!&#8221; (Liquor &#8230; &#8220;Lick Her&#8221; &#8230; get it?) When I first heard this, I had to think about it a minute. I was tempted to respond with such answers as: &#8220;Nothing wrong with strange bedfellows&#8221;, or &#8220;How you know she won&#8217;t like it?&#8221; But what little decency I had at the time kept my big mouth shut.<br />
About fifteen minutes after Stefan had turned around, he got back onto I-25, and started south. We didn&#8217;t have to go far, only about four miles until we got to the exit we needed. On the west side of I-25 was the Tank Proving Grounds. I assumed it also to be an active wargames venue, as in several of the valleys we could see, the Army had erected camouflaged tents and command centres. But there were no tanks or people in sight. Stefan was actually hoping to hear cannon shots all night.<br />
When we exited the highway, Stefan pointed out the wrong way to get to the KOA. The last time he had been there, he had turned right instead of left and drove right into an active wargame. I found this rather interesting considering the roads were lined with Tank Crossing signs. They look just like people crossing signs (yellow diamond-shaped signs with black silhouettes), but have little black tanks on them instead of people. Unfortunately, we forgot to take a picture of one of them.<br />
I started following all the instructions I could read verbatim. We turned left, and drove only about 150 feet, then turned right onto a small road that ran along the northbound lanes of I-25. We drove down that about a half mile, until the logo of the KOA sprang into view. Four quiet sighs hissed through the van as we saw the end of our 30 hour trek in view.<br />
Stefan sounded as happy as Marcel Marceau as he pulled in and prepared to get us signed in for the night. He pulled in our front of the KOA office, grabbed his wallet and darted inside. After a few minutes, Rebecca and I also got out and wandered inside to see what was taking so long.<br />
The office was combination administration depot and convenience store. The room was about 40 feet wide by 20 feet long, with a small jutting to the right of the door where souvenir t-shirts and hats were displayed. In the middle of the room was a small selection of foodstuffs, toiletries, and other necessities that are associated with camping and RV life. At the back of the room were three sets of glass doors, which at the time were papered up so you couldn&#8217;t see through them. (We found out the next morning that they were for a refrigeration cabinet, either just being installed or being upgraded.) To the left of the door was the administrative desk, which was where we found Stefan.<br />
The clerk was a young woman, probably somewhere in her 20&#8217;s. I doubted that she was the owner of the establishment, partly due to her apparent age, partly due to her countenance (which wasn&#8217;t exactly welcoming &#8211; we never saw her smile or heard her laugh). I assumed that it was partly due to the fact that it was less than half an hour until closing (which was at 20:00 in the evenings). She was an unremarkable woman, neither immediately attractive, nor offensive in appearance. She was about five foot, eight inches in height, about 180 pounds, with fairly long dirty blonde hair. She wore no visible makeup except for her cherry nail polish.<br />
Stefan was trying to figure out exactly what we needed. He had already signed up for a membership, a requirement for a stay at a KOA, and was being instructed on a special deal we had managed to stumble across that would potentially save us a lot of money. I wandered about the store as Stefan and Rebecca hovered on every word the clerk had to say. Rebecca paid particular attention to the hot tub and pool information. Unfortunately, the pool was still closed. But we still had about 20 minutes to get into the hot tub.<br />
Stefan took the camp map, which had our camping slot clearly marked, and we headed back to the van where Dhar was patiently waiting for us to return. Stefan drove carefully down the gravel roads, looking for the right slot for us to drive into. When we found it, we realized that we had come around the wrong way, and had to drive further down the path and return down the next path over. (This was because the water and electrical hook-ups were on the driver&#8217;s side of the van.)<br />
The camp itself was nothing spectacular &#8212; in fact it was the looking of the three we had seen. By &#8220;plainest&#8221;, I mean there were no trees next to the campsites, the grass still was slightly yellow from the winter snow, and what few trees there were had not yet started to grow leaves in any abundance. There were about five small gravel roads parallel to the road we drove on from I-25. Between the gravel roads were RV camping &#8220;pull-throughs&#8221;, designed to ease the process of parking and leaving. Just down from the main entrance were the bathrooms, pool and hot tubs which were all contained in the same building. Further down (east in direction) were half a dozen Kamping Kabins, a small log house that contained bunkbeds for those who want the camping experience without actually camping. (Not unlike a full-frontal lobotomy &#8230; for that feeling of death, without really dying.)<br />
Once we had parked, I took the keys from Stefan and went around to the storage compartment to hook the van up to the water and electricity. The running boards of the van behind the driver were converted into a storage compartment large enough to hold two golf bags. In the compartment we kept a small propane barbeque, a garden hose for the city water hook-up, a heavy duty 110 volt extension cable, an adapter to handle the standard 110 volt three prong outlets, and the van&#8217;s built-in 110 volt connection cable.<br />
At the bottom of the compartment is a round access hatch with a screw-in cover, used for running electrical and water supplies without having the compartment door open all the time. I ran the electrical cord out and plugged it in, then ran the water hose from the tap into the screw fitting. The tap leaked slightly, but the screw fitting on the van was watertight. I then closed the compartment and locked the door.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were about to leave when I got back in. Dhar was refusing to go into the hot tub with the rest of us, but was all for a much needed shower. I grabbed my swim trunks, towel, soap and shampoo, then hopped out of the van and went around the back. I opened the back door and removed my hiking backpack from the trunk space under the rear bench. The four of us then headed towards the showers.<br />
The air in Colorado was not as cold as Kansas had been that morning, and there was more sun to keep us warm. However, the sun was setting, and the air was cooling off with every minute. But it wasn&#8217;t uncomfortably cool. The four of us wearily trudged across the gravel roads, glancing at some of the technical marvels we were sharing the campground with. Many were enormous, some even had DirecTV dishes set up so the occupants wouldn&#8217;t miss a minute of Y &amp; R. We had chosen not to bring a TV with us (even though it was a possibility). We felt there was too much else to watch. (Though a TV and VCP would have been nice across Kansas &#8230; and Arizona &#8230; and New Mexico &#8230; Texas wasn&#8217;t so hot either &#8230;)<br />
The building was fairly simple &#8212; we entered about a third of the way along the side of the building. To our right was the pool and two hot tubs, though only one tub was open. To our left were the women&#8217;s and men&#8217;s washrooms. The washrooms were nothing special, having the necessary toilets, showers, and sinks. The three of us (men) immediately set down to getting ready. I jumped in a shower stall, put on my swim trunks, and quickly jumped into the shower to rinse myself off (common courtesy before climbing into a public water-based entertainment facility).<br />
The showers were strange, to the point of becoming annoying &#8212; they had only one knob, which unlike other single-knob showers I knew of, only turned off and on. The water temperature appeared to be fixed to slightly above what I considered to be comfortable. Yippee.<br />
Stefan was already outside by the time I was ready. I grabbed my clothes, stuffed them in my knapsack, and hauled it out to the hot tub, fenced away from the washrooms. I commented mentally that the fence looked rather odd indoors. Stefan and Rebecca were accompanied by a man, perhaps in his late 50&#8217;s or early 60&#8217;s.<br />
I had used a hot tub only a couple times before. Former neighbours of mine in Oakville had put in a hot tub in the early 1980&#8217;s, and as a child had used it a few times with the neighbour&#8217;s children, who were friends of mine. That family had kept the hot tub at over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which I found very uncomfortable and hard to get into. The hot tub at the KOA was thankfully different, its temperature was around body temperature. I climbed in with relative ease, and almost immediately, the 3,000 kilometres and 30 hours of driving vanished in the bubbles.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing what a simple device a hot tub is. Essentially a square (or round, depending on configuration) bathtub riddled with air hoses and nozzles, the hot tub is the only known device known to humanity that can suck out all the stress you have and provide sexual gratification at the same time. Though I&#8217;ve often heard those go hand-in-hand, if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun. Nevertheless, I was relieved to be bobbing in it.<br />
I was wearing a pair of swim trunks I had found left at my home almost ten years previous. They still fit me, though only barely. I hated them. I preferred to wear my bikini-style swim suit I had from my days in the swim team in high school. But as I had found out on a previous trip to Florida, most of my friends didn&#8217;t approve of me wearing them. As they put it, the swim suit didn&#8217;t &#8220;leave much to the imagination&#8221;. Not knowing how Rebecca, Dhar, or Stefan would respond, I chose not to bring it.<br />
Stefan was wearing a bikini-style swim suit, and Rebecca had her swim team swim suit, both in a matching black. I suddenly felt like an idiot for thinking I could offend either of them with my swim suit. I then reminded myself that I had also lost my physique from high school, and retracted my previous thought. Wearing such a swim suit, considering that I purposely bought it a size too small for racing purposes, it would have caused my thighs to pinch and bulge, which as you can undoubtedly imagine, is not particularly attractive.<br />
The stranger appeared to be your typical retired well-to-do office worker. He wore glasses, probably of a light to medium prescription, had white hair with a few flecks of original colour, and a wedding ring. We soon learned that his wife was to be joining him.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca had been talking with him quickly before I arrived, and I soon learned that he and his wife were on a trip much like ours, only in reverse. And not as fast. The man hailed from Detroit, and had been driving for the last few weeks through New Orleans, Texas, Arizona, Las Vegas and had just reached Colorado, at about the same time we had arrived. I guessed that the man knew where he was going, while we aimlessly bounced around the city figuring out what to do.<br />
Next thing I knew, I was shifting to the right to avoid being stepped on by the man&#8217;s wife as she climbed into the tub. I was not the only one who had been stung before by hot tubs that were too hot. It took her a moment to get in, but she too found it very relaxing. I suddenly felt very alone, the only single person in hot water. An interesting symbol, if you think about it a while.<br />
I quickly found out that the walls and floor of the tub were sculpted, with certain shapes installed containing jets to calm those aching muscles. A chair now rested under me, as did an air jet which ever so conveniently caused my trunks to fill with air. That annoying little trait made wish all the more that I had brought my Speedos with me.<br />
The five of us floated in the now-cramped tub for about another five minutes before I decided I was going to get have a shower before going back to the van. The tub, for all its relaxing power, reeked of chlorine. As a former member of the swim team, the smell of chlorine became a bit of an aphrodisiac &#8212; its prickly scent would make we swoon, almost pant in desire to swim. But after several years of abstinence, the smell was making me nauseous.<br />
I hauled myself out of the enveloping warmth, grabbed my knapsack, and headed back to the washroom. Dhar was stepping out having completed his shower. He smiled for a moment, about to ask me a question, when I asked if he could take my bag back with him while I showered. He was to ask the same question I proposed.<br />
The shower was hot, but after the hot tub, not as severely uncomfortable. I bathed in its heated glory, washing off the remaining grime collected after traversing almost three-quarters the distance across the continent. My hair felt free of the oil and dirt, my skin free of the suffocating dinginess. After ten minutes of scrubbing, I felt good enough to go to bed.<br />
I dried, changed into clean clothes, combed my hair, and jogged back to the van in the cooling air of dusk. Dhar was there reading one of the TourBooks. I stowed my toiletries on the shelf in the toilet closet, hung my towel to dry, and put my dirty clothes in a plastic bag. I then sat down and sighed in satisfaction of having arrived.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca showed up about five minutes later, and announced they were hungry. We all were. The last thing we had eaten were blue corn tortilla chips as we crossed Kansas some six hours earlier. It was decided that the hot dogs were the food of choice. I asked Stefan to grab one of the propane tanks from the trunk space (accessible through a hatch under the rear bench seat cushions) while I retrieved the barbeque from the running board compartment.<br />
Rebecca dug out the hot dogs, actually turkey dogs (Dhar refused to eat red meat, or drink milk &#8230; at least in most cases, he hadn&#8217;t quite kicked using milk in his coffee), and the buns. I set up the barbeque, got the butane lighter from the kitchen and started heating the burner. Despite its size, the barbeque heated very quickly and delivered a staggering amount of heat. It made quick work of the hot dogs. Not to mention toasting Rebecca&#8217;s buns. (Insert rude comments here.)<br />
Inside we set up the forward table, turning the driver&#8217;s and navigator&#8217;s seats to face the rear seats. In less than ten minutes, the hot dogs were ready and we all sat down to eat our first meal on the road. Rebecca, Stefan and I raised our milk in toast, Dhar his glass of Coke. Then we downed a package of twelve hot dogs. Like I said, we were hungry. By this time, it was barely 22:00.<br />
We had to close the side doors at one point, the air outside was becoming cool and Rebecca was getting cold. The van proved to be a very good protector against the cold, and also the heat. I suppose that all the insulation that Home &amp; Park cram into the van&#8217;s body tends to help.<br />
We made quick work of cleanup. Rebecca and Dhar washed the dishes, I put away the barbeque. The propane tank, however, seemed not to properly close. The tank was a simple design: the top was screwed into a regulator which had a small needle that opened the seal of the tank. But the seal wasn&#8217;t closing properly, and gas continued to leak out. I put the white cap back on and left it on the passenger side running board, in hopes it would seal overnight.<br />
The table was disassembled and the beds made. It was the first time I had truly had to set up both driver&#8217;s and navigator&#8217;s beds, and I was curious to see what it would look like. The chair were turned 90 degrees until they were back-to-back, and the rear seats unfolded. The beds turned out to be designed for people slightly shorted than Dhar and myself, but would suit our needs for the trip.<br />
We drew the blinds and locked the doors. I made an effort to brush my teeth in the sink, removing the last of the scum two days had brought on my mouth. Then I crawled into my brown sleeping bag, prepared to catch up on a day&#8217;s worth of sleep. I quickly noticed two things: there was a hole in my sleeping bag liner, and Dhar snored.<br />
I&#8217;ve always been jealous of people who can fall asleep quickly. I normally take between 15 and 30 minutes to fall asleep, and as much as two hours if I&#8217;m anxious about something. Dhar fell asleep in under five minutes, at least that was how long it took him to start snoring. Not that snoring bothered me too much &#8212; both my parents snored and ground their teeth. Even my first cat snored, and that was louder than both my parents! I just shook my head and prepared to pass out.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Alive and well, we&#8217;re now about to settle in for the night. It took us too long to find the stupid KOA, but we&#8217;re all set now. Probably lost a propane tank. Met some folks taking a similar trip as us, but only in reverse.Kansas was hideously boring.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke at a little after 08:00 that morning. I wasn&#8217;t the slightest but groggy, my usual waking state &#8212; I was excited. The day had finally come. I wandered out of my room. Dhar&#8217;s (rather, my sister&#8217;s) door was open, and he wasn&#8217;t anywhere to be seen. The bed didn&#8217;t even look slept in &#8212; either he stayed up all night, or was much neater than me (which, with all honest, can&#8217;t be all that difficult). Little did I know at the time that Dhar didn&#8217;t require a lot of sleep. I quickly jumped in and out of the shower and did all the neat and tidy things I could to make myself look presentable for the first day. Exactly why I did this I&#8217;m not too entirely sure &#8212; Stefan and Rebecca knew who I was, and what I was capable of. I guess it was mostly for Dhar&#8217;s sake, I didn&#8217;t want to frighten him &#8230; at least until we were out of the country.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan were still sleeping at the time, so I went outside as quietly as I could (not too easily done, the front door creaks quite loudly). I quickly found Dhar, having what appeared to be a deeply involving automotive discussion with my father. This didn&#8217;t particularly surprise me since my father had previously owned a Ford Probe as well, but had given it up due to a bad back &#8212; or to be more specific, the bad back the Probe gave him. As it turned out, Dhar had quickly learned as much about the van as I knew, which I knew would come in handy in the event that I forgot about something important. And when it comes to cars, I usually tend to forget everything.<br />
My father had already gone to the trouble of draining the fresh water tanks, an experience that told us how slow the tank emptied, and refilled it with clean water. He did this twice to make sure that the tank was free of Javex prior to our departure. (There&#8217;s nothing like the taste of bleach-contaminated water &#8230; and after that you&#8217;ll can taste nothing.) The water hose was coiled and put away along with the electrical cable in the running board storage compartment.<br />
A moment later, Stefan bounded out of the front door. Either someone had awaken him and Rebecca (the latter of which was not nearly as fast moving in the morning as the rest of us), or like Dhar and myself, were too anxious to sleep any longer. Dhar took this opportunity to make use of the shower, before starting what would be a 30 hour drive to Colorado.<br />
Our trip was ambitious (bordering on insanity, at least according to some of our friends and family), but not as ambitious as it had once been. In less than two weeks, we planned to visit Colorado Springs, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Albuquerque, Roswell, San Antonio, Houston, New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville, and Cleveland. Originally we had also planned to visit Death Valley, Los Angeles and San Diego. However, when our time became more and more constrained, and we realized just how large a trip we were looking at, we cut California right out of the picture. As it turned out, we didn&#8217;t even get to see all that we had planned (namely the entire state of Texas).<br />
At this time, I would like to provide some free advertisement for the Canadian Automobile Association (and its American counterpart). Planning a trip like this would have been a complete nightmare if it were not for the efforts of the CAA. Not to mention all the freebies that come with membership&#8230;<br />
A few years ago, my parents bought my sister and I memberships with the CAA. This was due mostly to both of us doing a great deal of driving to and from our beautiful national capital (Ottawa), sometimes in less than ideal weather. While it&#8217;s true that a CAA membership (or suitable equivalent) isn&#8217;t used very often, the times that you need it most are the ones you&#8217;re glad you have it. This trip was just one of those occasions.<br />
On a suggestion from my mother (suggestions being 50% of motherly duties, the remainder made of nagging, scolding, and guilt-tripping), I went to the Hamilton Automobile Club (the local branch of the CAA), and informed them of the trip. From the destinations that had become our route, the CAA created a &#8220;TripTik&#8221;, which is a city-by-city, highway-by-highway map of your journey. For the Interstate-uninitiated, this can be a Godsend, keeping you on the right track whilst traveling through the United States (though we realized that you&#8217;re better off if you&#8217;ve got a map book that covers Interstates). I also acquired a rather large collection of travel books for all the states that we would either be visiting or passing through. Most of these books got extensive use.<br />
And the membership is compatible with the AAA (the American Automobile Association), in the event you need roadside assistance somewhere in the United States &#8230; providing of course that you have a method of contacting them (there&#8217;s never a pay phone in the middle of the Mojave Desert when you need one). We never needed that kind of coverage, but the knowledge that we had access to it was enough to let us drive in peace and not worry about a major problem. Being a member also means less problems with health &#8212; for a mere $20, I also bought extra health coverage in America just in case I fell ill. Again, it wasn&#8217;t needed, but without it I would have had to pay a fortune in medical costs (getting sick in the States is not good for your health, bodily and financially).<br />
So for anyone planning an extensive trip in the United States, I strongly recommend getting a CAA membership (or AAA, if you happen to live in the U.S.). You never know when problems will come, and Murphy&#8217;s Law always says you&#8217;ll get them at the most inopportune time. This means that you&#8217;ll lose all your fluids in the middle of the desert. Luckily, we didn&#8217;t &#8212; but we were covered in case Murphy had stowed along for the ride (which was a bit doubtful, when you considered all the crap we brought along).<br />
Most people (except the good souls at the CAA) who I mentioned the trip to thought we were insane. Over 10,000 kilometres in less than two weeks was not what most people would consider a vacation. I, for one, cannot stand sitting in the sun for more than a day without my brain decalcifying from having nothing to do. The thought of visiting so many places seemed like a dream come true to me, I only wished that we had more time so that we could have included California in the itinerary.<br />
And besides, the purpose of the whole fling was as a road trip. All road trips are characterized by one thing: piling into a vehicle and driving a long distance. Until our &#8220;Road Trip From Hell&#8221;, I hadn&#8217;t been on a trip that exceeded six hundred kilometres in distance. I was embarking on a discovery tour, going places I had only seen in movies and TV, or read about in magazines and books. I would be doing things that a year previous I never even imagined. And the whole time I would enjoy myself &#8230; or at least that was the plan.<br />
But before we could pack ourselves into the van, my parents (specifically my mother, performing one of her lesser, but still necessary, motherly duties) turned into the kind of sappy parents you see parodies of in National Lampoon. The dreaded camera was out. We arranged ourselves like a police line up and politely grinned as my mother decided that she would take the first picture of the trip. (I didn&#8217;t bother to tell her that Dhar had already taken a picture the night before during the tour, to prove the size of the inside of the van.)<br />
As a last step before final boarding was called, I got the spare set of keys from the hall drawer. In case something befell the set of keys the current driver carried, my father suggested (in other words, decided) that we should bring spares. The safety of those keys were naturally entrusted to the most responsible person in the group. Stefan and Dhar looked a little taken aback when I handed the huge plastic keyring to Rebecca.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960421.10</strong><br />
<em>Day 1</em><br />
We&#8217;re ready to hit the road. Everyone showed up early last night, kinda caught me off guard. But we&#8217;re now ready to hit the road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus we piled into the van and strapped ourselves in for the longest drive we would have for the duration of the trip. Partly to appease my father, and to let the others get accustomed to the van &#8212; though mostly due to pride &#8212; I took the first shift of driving. I carefully nudged the van forward, tooted the horn (which if you ask me, is not nearly loud enough), rounded the corner and didn&#8217;t look back.<br />
At least until I got to Maplegrove Village, where my branch of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was located. I needed to make a quick transaction to prevent my cheques from bouncing. Less than five minutes later, we headed up Ford Drive to join with Highway 403. From there to the Trafalgar Road bypass, which in turn would take us to Highway 401. Less than a half hour from leaving home, I set the cruise control for 100 km/h, Dhar set the CD player, and we headed for Windsor, which would eventually take us to Detroit &#8212; our gateway to the United States.<br />
The stretch of highways from Oakville to Highway 8 I had driven many times, as that was the route I took to get to the University of Waterloo, where I had been studying English Rhetoric and Professional Writing. Those stretches took about half an hour to cover. Once we past that, I commented that I was traveling a portion of the 401 that I had never seen before. Stefan was rather startled by this revelation, I guess he believed that I had gone this way several times.<br />
Suddenly I realized that only Stefan had ventured to the Midwest previously. Dhar, Rebecca and myself were all proverbial virgins at that portion of the continent. I was no stranger to the West, my relatives live in Saskatchewan. However, that had been as far west as I had ever traveled with good memory. My mother claims to this day that I went to British Columbia as a wee babe to visit my mother&#8217;s Godmother, but my memory as a wee babe does not recall such a venture (although, oddly enough, it does include an incident of sitting down while wearing soiled diapers). As such, this trip would be my first real experience of the West.<br />
For the next two hours or so we continued along the 401, while forming what would eventually become our regular pastime &#8212; finding out more about each other. I learned a great many things not only of Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar, but also of myself. They were things I had known unconsciously, but only through such conversation did the truth come to the surface &#8230; but not necessarily to light.<br />
Less than an hour from the border, we stopped at what would become our last taste of Canada for almost two weeks: a batch of Tim Horton&#8217;s Timbits (donut holes to the uneducated). It was a fortuitous stop in more than one way, as I also needed to relieve a filled bladder. Once again, I was confronted with an odd insecurity I, and many other males have &#8212; an inability to use a urinal when other men are present.<br />
It&#8217;s rather annoying: you walk into the Men&#8217;s Room, stand in front of the urinal, unzip the front of your pants, and stand uncomfortably because for some reason none of the muscles in your groin care to cooperate and allow you to urinate. What causes it I have no idea. At one time I used to think it was a result of being insecure about my genitals. After several years of university, endless discussions of sex, and more &#8220;interesting&#8221; situations I care to recall, I choose to discount that theory &#8230; at least for myself. Besides, I&#8217;ve found that with practice the problem goes away.<br />
At any rate, this problem was quickly overcome with the use of one of the toilet stalls. I may have received a few odd looks, but less pressure at the waistline allows me the luxury to not care and proceed with my life.<br />
Within minutes, we piled back into the van and resumed our heading westward. An hour later, we entered Windsor, and caught our first glimpse of the Ambassador Bridge, peeking above the tops of the low-set skyline. Our time in Canada was drawing to a close. On an earlier suggestion from Stefan, we immediately began to look for Canadian Customs, so we could register our more expensive items on board. This was for two reasons: in the event something got stolen, or in case Customs believed that we were trying to smuggle something back.<br />
Before I knew it, I (still the current driver) had accidentally overshot the entrance to the Customs facility. Unfortunately, I had never entered into the United States through the Windsor gateway, I had always gone through either Niagara or Fort Erie. I knew where the Customs facilities were there. We quickly ducked into the area normally reserved for trucks going to the U.S. Rebecca and Stefan went into the office to find out how we would get back to the Customs building. The roads around the facility were all one-way roads, so we were justifiably confused.<br />
The instructions they returned with were cryptic at best (not unexpected from Canadian Customs officials). We had to ask someone else. This meant we had to cross through the toll access point. When we got to the booth, we asked the attendant what we had to do. She told us to go up the road a little, just pass the median, pull a U-turn and head back towards the Canadian Customs booths just below us. There we could find out what to do. We received a receipt in the event we got hopelessly lost and ended up back at the toll booths again.<br />
Once I had us pointed back in Canada again, we pulled up to the Canadian Customs booths. In less than three seconds we completely managed to confound the clerk, trying to explain to him what had just happened (it&#8217;s always fun to play &#8220;Stump the Chump&#8221;). But in a moment he understood and pointed us in the right direction to the Customs building. He also pointed out the route we would later take to get back to the bridge and avoid the toll booths. The man scribbled on a yellow piece of paper and handed it to us, not mentioning what it was for, then waved us on.<br />
We drove across a large roadway into the Customs complex, and found a pull-through parking slot. We immediately noticed the plethora of Government employees not doing anything (in other words, a typical Government installation). We were sadly not surprised at this, disappointed that our tax dollars were feeding apathy.<br />
We immediately set down to finding every last serial number of an expensive item we had. Fortunately, Home &amp; Park (who built the Behemoth) had already created a list of all the van&#8217;s expensive items. Dhar&#8217;s camera, lens and flash; my camera, lens and flash; the CD player; and Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s camera were recorded onto a piece of paper. Then Dhar and I wandered over to the main Customs building for approval.<br />
We expected a large lineup &#8212; it was a Government office, after all. Border crossings, although nicely informal, were often slow mainly due to volume. This was the first time I had ever gone through the Customs office before leaving the country, but I expected no difference in efficiency.<br />
Upon entering the doors, Dhar and I immediately noticed several people sitting down, a few people at kiosks, and a bunch of Government employees milling around doing nothing (different group of public employees, same work ethic). We paused a moment, and ventured to stand in line. Almost immediately, a woman behind the counter moved away from her discussion and motioned us to go to her. We informed her we only wanted to register the items we were taking over with us. She in turn asked if we had the serial numbers available. I produced the sheet that came with the van and the one we created, mentioning that some items didn&#8217;t have serial numbers. Even before I had finished speaking, the two sheets were stamped and the woman had walked away. Dhar and I looked at each other in surprise, shrugged our shoulders in disbelief, and headed back towards the doors. It was hard to say what bothered me more: the fact that she really seem to care about what she was doing, or that we were only in the building for 30 seconds.<br />
On the way back to the van, Dhar and I encountered two more Customs agents, who took the mysterious little piece of yellow paper from me, looked at it, then waved us on. Typically cryptic government shenanigans. We were probably passing notes between all the clerks. Now hopelessly confused, Dhar and I returned to a locked van (and me without my keys). Stefan unlocked the door, Dhar and I climbed in, and we prepared to finally leave Canada behind us.<br />
A minute later we had crossed the political border and were stuck in a traffic jam on the down side of the bridge. And we were in the slow lane. I had not yet learned all the nuances of the van, and wasn&#8217;t in the mood for trying to run into the next lane. We were in no hurry, so we decided to critique the City of Detroit instead.<br />
We were amazed at the decay we could see. Buildings crumbling, garbage everywhere, soot and grime seemed to cover everything. Even the air seemed dirtier than just across the river. Detroit seemed a large unwieldy mess of concrete, glass, and steel. It&#8217;s amazing how much culture shock one can receive merely by traveling less than one kilometre, the distance from Canada to the U.S.<br />
A half hour after crossing the bridge, we finally arrived at the U.S. Customs booth. It was time for 20 Questions. &#8220;Where ya goin&#8217;? Fer how long? Are ya takin&#8217; any fruit or vegetables? Where ya from? Is ev&#8217;one Canadian? Lessee yer birth certificates. You in back, lessee? Anythin&#8217; to declare? Okay, have a good time.&#8221; I almost expected to hear a &#8220;y&#8217;all&#8221; as we passed out of earshot.<br />
We breathed a sigh of relief, even if only psychologically, as we were now free to roam the vast expanses of America without any fear of something hanging over our heads. Dhar quickly dug out the TripTik again, and began deciphering the route to get out of Detroit and onto I-94. I didn&#8217;t quite catch the instructions completely, so Stefan attempted to clarify. It was only when the most responsible person of the trip got a hold of the TripTik did we finally get moving. When in doubt, ask a woman.<br />
Dhar started drooling less than five minutes into the States. We made the mistake of taking a route through the middle of the Motor City, the headquarters of the Ford Motor Corporation. Detroit was Dhar&#8217;s Mecca, and took every opportunity to find Ford billboards, and if he was lucky, an automotive plant. I waited with baited breath for the question: &#8220;Can we go on a Ford tour?&#8221;. As we exited Detroit into its suburbs, Dhar spotted Ford&#8217;s Special Vehicle Labs. It was there such geniuses as Shelby created some of the most well-known American sports cars in existence. It was there that Dhar&#8217;s Probe was given birth on a drawing board. He sighed as we passed westward.<br />
Outside of Detroit we got sidetracked. Actually, sidetracked isn&#8217;t the right word. We got lost. Ann Arbor creates a divide in I-94, causing the main route to go just south of the city, and a smaller state highway to go north of the city. At this point, none of us were completely comfortable with U.S. highways, and we weren&#8217;t ready for the split. In a panic of which route to take, we took the north route onto State Highway 23, away from I-94. At first we thought we were still on I-94. But when we realized that the red, white and blue I-94 highway markers were replaced with a white shield bearing the number &#8217;23&#8217;, we panicked. But only for a moment or two.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t help feel like morons for getting lost in America so quickly. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, we still had two weeks to find our way around. In only a matter of moments, someone figured out that Highway 23 was nothing more than a bypass of the city, and wasn&#8217;t going to get us hopelessly lost. We continued to follow the 23 around until we saw signs that guided us back to I-94.<br />
Road trips, by their very nature, tend to be performed by the seat-of-the-pants &#8230; in other words, unplanned. Ours was intended to be the exception &#8212; we had done a good deal of the ground work in advance. Or at least that was the impression I had given myself. Prior to leaving, we had established a long line of places we wanted to go and roads we had to travel. Due to our time constraints, we also knew that there wasn&#8217;t too much room for leeway. But as one can inevitably expect, plans change. Ours started to.<br />
Stefan, unbeknownst to me (and the others, much to our chagrin), wanted to go places we had never even discussed. First off, I&#8217;ll state for the record that Stefan is a nature nut. Now I&#8217;m not holding that against him &#8212; I am too, though not quite to the extent of Stefan &#8230; or Rebecca, for that matter &#8212; but he wanted more nature than we planned for.<br />
Colorado is a state full of natural wonders, most of which spring up due to two things: the geology and the general remoteness of certain parts of the state. The end result is an abundance of parks &#8230; a good deal of which Stefan wanted to visit. Under different circumstances, I might have gone along with the deal. Maybe if we had planned not to go to places like Las Vegas and New Orleans, perhaps I would have been more supportive. But I was in an explorative mood, and I wanted to see all that I could see, and an endless number of trees and mountains wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to explore.<br />
Thus we began to argue &#8230; okay, maybe argue isn&#8217;t the correct term &#8230; discuss loudly where we going. I quickly realized, with some relief, that I wasn&#8217;t alone. Rebecca and Dhar both wanted to see Vegas and at least one of the other places we had planned. Stefan was pushing for at least four days in Colorado. I knew full well that any more than two would result in having to axe something from the trip. (As it turns out, we had to axe the entire state of Texas, but that was for different reasons.)<br />
The discussion lasted for roughly fifteen minutes when the most responsible member of the group called an end because it was giving her a headache. We resolved to continue the discussion in Colorado Springs when we were settled in.<br />
We weren&#8217;t even out of Michigan.<br />
The roadside billboards became, for a while, a focus of some fascination for us. In Canada, the public has prevented the plethora of eyesores that American urban highways are noted for. The diversity of the ads, and the names of the products they advertise provided us with a great deal of entertainment, especially Dhar.<br />
Earlier that morning, I learned of Dhar&#8217;s habitual rhymes: &#8220;Awesome Possum&#8221;, &#8220;Starvin&#8217; Marvin&#8221;, &#8220;Gotta Stop Lollipop&#8221;, and so forth. Cute, but endlessly annoying if left unchecked for a few days. (Not to mention the fact that it was a habit I was afraid I would adopt over the course of the trip.) Luckily, for me, Dhar either grew tired of the habit, or he didn&#8217;t use it very often in the first place. Either way, the rhymes were infrequent.<br />
So what does Dhar&#8217;s habitual rhyming have to do with billboards? Shortly before we entered Lansing, Dhar nearly leapt out of his seat. For a moment he was stammering about something he had seen, and we couldn&#8217;t understand him. When asked to repeat his statement, we learned that we had just passed a billboard advertising, and I swear I&#8217;m not making this up, a store called Starvin&#8217; Marvin. Dhar swore then and there that he would have a picture of a Starvin&#8217; Marvin store before the trip was over.<br />
I continued to drive until we arrived in Lansing, Michigan. By that point I had been driving for about six hours, and was feeling tired. This was my first introduction to Interstate Rest Areas. This was part of Dwight Eisenhower&#8217;s plans for a great American highway system. About every 20 miles or so outside of urban areas one can find small parking lots, usually with toilets, at the side of the Interstate. These quickly became havens for us, where we stopped to use the bathrooms, cook our dinners, or catch enough sleep to keep driving. I used the opportunity to call home.<br />
Now don&#8217;t go callin&#8217; me a momma&#8217;s boy &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t homesick, just absent-minded. I had forgotten two very important things: addresses to mail postcards, and my CAA health insurance number. The latter I could do without until a major crisis developed, but the addresses I would need much sooner.<br />
AT&amp;T (or whoever ran the local payphones) has a particularly annoying collect call system. I had to actually say into the phone &#8220;Collect Call&#8221; to place the call. Even though I had to key in the number, I had to vocalize what I wanted. Some programmer could&#8217;ve made everyone&#8217;s life a lot easier but just having someone press &#8216;1&#8217; or &#8216;2&#8217;, and so forth. Humanity tries to make life too easy, and ends up making it more complicated.<br />
My mother immediately panicked (a typically mother-like thing to do), not expecting to hear from me so soon. I reassured her that the only reason I was calling was to get the information I had left behind. A moment later I had the addresses safely jotted down in my organizer, but the health insurance was nowhere to be found. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned about this, but decided to make another check of my stuff to make sure I didn&#8217;t actually manage to pack it when I wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
We&#8217;re well into the States now, despite an unintentional detour. I got Scott&#8217;s, Tara&#8217;s, Chris&#8217; and Kathryn&#8217;s addresses &#8211; I should be okay from here. It&#8217;s 4:37 now, and we still have some 18 hours until we get to our final destination.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Stefan volunteered for the next shift of driving, and I retired to the couch in the rear to get some sleep. We had plans to drive in a six hour rotation, so that we could easily drive through the night and arrive in Colorado Springs as soon as possible. Thus it made sense for me to get some sleep so we wouldn&#8217;t have any problems with me driving come morning.<br />
However, I had always had problems sleeping in cars, so I doubted heavily that I would be able to sleep at all while we were on the road. Nevertheless, I went to the back, stretched myself out on the bench, buckled myself in so I wouldn&#8217;t fall off, and tried to get a couple hours of sleep. I closed my eyes and began a mental exercise to try and get myself to sleep. I&#8217;m normally a heavy sleeper, but it takes a long time for me to get to a heavy sleeping state. Over the years I developed a mental exercise which causes me to reflect sleepiness back into my mind, thus amplifying the effect. But it wasn&#8217;t working in the van.<br />
Next thing I knew, we were exiting I-94 somewhere just inside the Indiana border. I had no idea how long I had been asleep, but I guessed at no more than an hour. It was time for our first fill-up of American gasoline, and our first shot at American gas-bar convenience stores. I quickly dug out my personal organizer, which was doubling as our travel expenses log. I jotted down the distance we covered on the tank of gas, and prepared to take the rest of the information regarding refill volume and price. But in the meantime I opted for disappearing into the store and getting something to eat.<br />
Never before had I seen a Subway in a gas station &#8230; a normal gas station. This wasn&#8217;t one of those mega-stations that started appearing along Highway 401 in Ontario, but an average sized gas station one would expect to see in any town or city. But inside was a Subway sandwich bar, complete with bread bakers. Only the seats and tables were missing. As near as I can figure, the only reason for such things was that it was next to an Interstate.<br />
But I was hungry, and not about to debate the reasoning for placing the Subway where it was. I quickly found out that the prices in the States (or at least along the Interstate) were almost identical to those in Canada, not counting the conversion. In other words, the American Subway was more expensive than the one just off-campus that I used to go to on an infrequent basis. Thus I opted for the cheapest sub they had available that I liked &#8212; the Subway Club.<br />
The toppings were all standard: lettuce, olives, hot peppers, green peppers, onions, pickles. But instead of normal mustard (which is French&#8217;s in Canada, if I&#8217;m not mistaken), it was Dijon mustard. And instead of Italian dressing (which is &#8220;sub sauce&#8221; in Canada), I had virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar. Added an interesting zing to the sub, but overall didn&#8217;t change the flavour much.<br />
I quickly discovered that I wasn&#8217;t as hungry as I thought I was, and ate only half the sub. I tossed the rest in the fridge for later. Dhar and Rebecca promptly decided they were going to have dinner. Dhar vacated the navigator&#8217;s position, and I took over. It was about this time that we entered the Fort Wayne area, which in other words meant that it was time for a navigator to start giving directions.<br />
Fort Wayne was one of the easier places for us to travel through &#8212; we never left the highway we were on. Despite the fact we ran through Fort Wayne at around 18:00, we didn&#8217;t encounter any traffic. Living near Toronto brings you a certain level of awareness of time. You know that there are several hours in the day that you simply don&#8217;t drive on the highways because you hit traffic so nasty you want to pull all you hair out. For example, rush hour in Toronto lasts from about 15:30 to nearly 18:30. But in Fort Wayne, the traffic never came &#8230; that was when I remembered that it was still Sunday.<br />
It&#8217;s often amazing how little meaning days of the week have when you go on a vacation. You just keep track of the actual dates themselves &#8212; you know you have to be in city X by the 23rd, and in canyon Y by the 25th. I was amazed at how quickly I forgot what the day was.<br />
Shortly after Dhar and Rebecca finished eating, Dhar lay down to get some sleep. He had volunteered for the late night shift, and wanted to be awake for it. I tried to convince myself that I would also need more sleep later on, since I would be driving again come the morning. But I knew that would be difficult, since I was so excited to finally be on another trip, the first one in five years.<br />
Stefan drove for the next four or five hours without any incident. It was an uneventful portion of the trip, we found new ways to keep ourselves interested. Several times I thought about opening my Linguistics text I had brought, so I could get some reading done. But every time I thought about it, the thought of doing school work while on a vacation seemed appallingly trite. Thus it remained packed in one of the upper compartments where I promised to forget about it for at least a week.<br />
My duties as navigator were required when we entered Indianapolis, shortly after nightfall. Here we moved up a highway, from I-69 to I-70. But to do so, we had to skirt around the edge of the city on the I-465. The Americans are rather interesting about how they design their highways &#8212; they seem to regularly build rings around their cities so travelers only need enter the city if they need do, unlike cities such as Toronto where you get mired in traffic if you pick your time poorly.<br />
Scarcely a half hour later, we were watching Indianapolis fade away into the greyness behind us. Already the sky was darkening as clouds began to form above us. It was a foreshadow of what we would receive later on that evening.<br />
A few hours later we arrived in St. Louis. It was dark and foggy, but even through the glare of the city lights, we could see the famous Gateway Arch off in the distance. I woke Dhar and Rebecca to view the sight, though I must admit, I seemed to be the only one interested in it. Another half hour, and we were exiting the St. Louis city limits, and re-entering the enveloping darkness of the Interstate.<br />
By this time, Stefan&#8217;s stint behind the wheel had ended, and he wanted to relax a while. Driving the van wasn&#8217;t at all tiring under normal circumstances, but when you had to fight the wind to keep the van in the lane you quickly got worn down. Fortunately, the wind had started to die down with the coming of night, but the damage had already been done and Stefan had to take a break for a few hours.<br />
Rebecca was the next victim in line. We pulled off the highway, down an off-ramp, crossed the road and got on the on-ramp, stopping just as we got onto it. Quickly, Stefan jumped out the door as Rebecca slid between the driver and navigator&#8217;s chairs and took her seat. The doors behind me opened and shut, there was a hasty clicking of belt buckles, and the van started back onto the Interstate.<br />
Prelude to disaster: Dhar and I used the same mirror settings, with the odd minor adjustment. Taking over from Stefan usually meant another larger adjustment to compensate for Stefan&#8217;s height. Under the best of conditions, Rebecca never would&#8217;ve been able to see with Stefan&#8217;s mirror settings. We were unknowingly about to throw Rebecca into conditions so bad they made me cringe. And we forgot to change the mirrors.<br />
After only a few minutes of driving, we realized our first major mistake &#8212; letting Rebecca drive in the dark. It&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s a bad driver (I&#8217;d never actually been in a car when she was driving), it&#8217;s that Rebecca wasn&#8217;t ready for the task. Back home in Kingston, Rebecca usually only drove about town during the day in her Dodge Laser (for those of you who don&#8217;t know, Kingston is a very peaceful city on the south side of Ontario, about half-way between Toronto and the Quebec border). We had put her behind the wheel of a three tonne, eight foot three inch high, 19 foot long, blind spot laden behemoth &#8230; in the middle of the night. Rebecca was justifiably worried.<br />
But we made efforts to try and adjust the mirrors so she could make it a couple hours, gain some experience, and let Dhar rest up before his early morning shift. But as Murphy&#8217;s Law always states: if anything is already wrong, it can only get worse.<br />
It began to rain.<br />
Heavily.<br />
I almost expected to see an off-ramp sign for Noah&#8217;s Ark.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Most of the work was on my family&#8217;s newly-purchased RoadTrek 190 Versatile, a Dodge Ram van converted into a small motorhome. It was the result of my aunt&#8217;s interest in the RoadTrek company, and my father&#8217;s interest in toys. I doubt my family would have been so quick in purchasing the RoadTrek (which would become to be known as &#8216;The Behemoth&#8217;) if this trip had never been thought of.<br />
When the trip had first been planned, we looked into renting a car or minivan to support us for our trip. But the costs were too high &#8212; we would be adding almost $200 per person before adding the cost of gasoline. The cost was so prohibitive, I volunteered my 1991 Plymouth Acclaim to ferry us about the United States. Not nearly as comfortable as a minivan, but certainly a lot cheaper than renting.<br />
Somewhere along the line, my parents found out about the trip (sometimes I think they&#8217;re telepathic &#8230; either that or I&#8217;m becoming more forgetful with age). Not that I was trying to keep the trip a secret &#8212; they had to eventually find out. My father, in one of what I have come to call his &#8220;moods&#8221; decided that a RoadTrek would be a good idea to take on such a trip. Seeing the possibilities (not the least of which was a lower cost for accommodation, and more space for stretching out), I chose not to argue.<br />
At the time, my family owned a 37&#8242; trawler, moored in Penetanguishene, just off Georgian Bay. But the upkeep on the boat, the costs required to maintain it, and the extremely short amount of time we could use it each year caused problems. The fact that only my father was experienced in driving the ship meant that neither my sister nor I could take it out without the presence of dear old dad. Not to mention the fact that a VHF license was required in the event we needed to use the radio. To make a long story short, my parents had already decided to sell the boat.<br />
So why not just sell the boat and leave it at that? Well, my parents (bless &#8217;em both) are registered members of CARP, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons. My father has been unofficially retired since about 1990, when his employer decided to force him to quit. He played around with a few other jobs, but I think it was mostly to prevent boredom. But in the past couple of years, dad calmed down and accepted the fact that he could do whatever he wanted.<br />
Selling the boat left us without a form of recreation outside the house. My parents, in quasi-retirement (my mother continues to do bookkeeping for a few local companies, and my father is too stubborn to relax), needed such a medium for their extra time when they weren&#8217;t doing something. The loss of the boat would mean that they would have no way of seeing the countryside without driving. And driving the car had its limits since you either had to return home at the end of the day, or spend a great deal of money going to hotels and restaurants.<br />
Enter RoadTrek: take your home with you. Although my mother liked the idea, the thought of driving everywhere was none too appealing for her. She never consciously would admit to it, but her attitude during the discussions of what to do continually said: &#8220;I really don&#8217;t want any part in this&#8221;. But in the end my father, my sister and I all agreed that buying the van was a good idea. My mother continued to smile and nod quietly.<br />
The van was picked up on a Thursday (three days from departure) from the dealer in Kitchener, where the dealer promptly gave my father and I a detailed breakdown on the operation of the vehicle. This involved the use of the liquid propane system; the black water, grey water, and fresh water tanks; the storage spaces; the hook-ups (water and electricity); the furnace; the hot water heater; air conditioner; sink; fridge; shower; toilet; and a few specifics about the underlying vehicle. This took almost three hours.<br />
On the morning of the 19th of April, plans were made to get all my gear ready to go, get a barbeque, garbage pail, dishes, food, money, tools, and a few other odds and ends for the van. My father and I found a barbeque at the local Wal-mart, despite some confusion with the pricing and stocking of the materials. We also bought an oil filter so we could make an oil change prior to departure.<br />
A garbage pail that would suit the deep blue interior of the van was not to be found anywhere. As such, I was directed to find a pail in the States. (This was a task uncompleted since not once did I see a waste bin for a van, let alone a deep blue one.) Money was also an uncompleted task, since I didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to the bank to withdraw $100 in American funds.<br />
On the morning of the 20th, I received my first real trial by fire, by taking the van up to my Aunt Ruth&#8217;s in Caledon East, just north of Toronto. The trip opened my eyes to just how sensitive the van was to winds, and how poorly it drove when it was unloaded. The van&#8217;s height, eight feet three inches, created an excellent wall that the wind could push very easily. This problem was overcome by loading material into the van, and by increasing the air pressure in the tires.<br />
Upon returning home, it rained. This was a problem because my father had intentions of changing the oil before the next day, departure day. When the rain stopped, he donned his coveralls, and pulled himself under the van to change the oil and attempt to lubricate the joints. Next we filled the fresh water tank to test it for ourselves. It was then we found a label in the storage compartment that told us to clean the tank before use.<br />
The Javex bottle was mysteriously waiting for me at the back door when I arrived to retrieve it, a complete coincidence. The tank was filled partly with bleach, and the rest with water. We then plugged the van into the house to charge the main battery, and set the fridge to cool overnight. The next morning we would flush the tanks and refill them with fresh water for the trip.<br />
That night, I packed and gathered together all the things I thought I was going to need for the trip: CD player (which I had bought earlier that day to replace my old one which seemed to have given up the will to spin), CDs (with specific titles suggested by Stefan and Rebecca), clothes, a couple hats, shoes, sandals, two books, and my journal and log book. At around midnight, I decided to check email.<br />
Following a pattern that had been ongoing for months, I had more messages from Rebecca and Stefan. I went over a few older ones to make sure I hadn&#8217;t forgotten something, and made note of a few other things mentioned in the newer messages. From everything I had read, I assumed that I would see them and Dhar at around noon the next day. No sooner than had I logged off, the doorbell sounded.<br />
(Okay, so it isn&#8217;t a doorbell, it&#8217;s another toy. The doorbell is musical, the result of my father doing strange things. It&#8217;s unique &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen, or heard, anything else like it, but after 15 years of use it&#8217;s no longer anything really fun. And it&#8217;s not something you want to hear at a quarter after midnight.)<br />
Almost as soon as I heard it, I knew who it was. None of my friends in Oakville would come by after 20:00 without checking with me much earlier. It could only have been Dhar, Stefan and Rebecca. I was right.<br />
I was shocked.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t ready.<br />
They were.<br />
When I opened the door to greet them, I suddenly realized that my parents had already enabled the security system, it started beeping immediately. A quick jump at the controls avoided a rather loud awaking for my father, who was already in bed.<br />
Suffice to say, I apologized for not being able to leave that night, and offered them a bed and a shower in the morning. Both Dhar and Stefan were a little agitated at not leaving, but sleep sounded good to both of them (they both had written exams earlier that day). Rebecca didn&#8217;t seem to really care one way or the other. But before turning in for the night, I offered a tour of what would become our mobile accommodations.<br />
Like any normal van, the RoadTrek has five doors: the driver&#8217;s door, the &#8220;shotgun&#8221; (or in our case, the navigator) door, a pair of doors behind the navigator, and a large door at the rear. Inside, RoadTrek put together a very nice, comfortable place to live for two weeks. The driver and navigator&#8217;s chairs are both orthopedic, with lumbar support controls. These chairs are meant to be used for long hauls, like our long stints behind the wheel. The chairs were fitted with both a front / back slide, and a swivel so they could turn 180 degrees and face backwards. This was necessary in part because when locked in a 90 degree position, these chairs formed part of the forward bunks.<br />
Behind the driver and navigator are two large seats. Unlike the front seats, these are built not to turn, slide or even tilt back. Instead, these chairs are disassembled to form the rest of the forward bunks. The seat portion of the chairs pulls out. The back slides up, and then is placed where the seat portion used to be, forming a longer pad. When the front seats are rotated 90 degrees, they form a reasonably comfortable bunk, although people over five foot five inches might find it a bit short.<br />
Between the two chairs is a lowered floor. Home &amp; Park (the builders of the RoadTrek vans) cut out an 18 inch by eight foot chunk out of the floor, and lowered it about four inches. This lowering, with the addition of the raised roof, provided me with exactly enough clearance to walk around without having to duck my head. Stefan wasn&#8217;t so lucky. At the front of this lowered section, between the two rear seats, is a hole to allow the setting of a table into the floor.<br />
Towards the back of the lowered floor is the kitchen / washroom area. On the driver&#8217;s side of the van is the kitchen: a sink, two burner gas stove, and a microwave oven (usable only when the van is connected to a 110 volt electrical system). Above the stove is a fan with a light to funnel away smells and waste gases from the burners. Above and below the sink are several cabinets for storing dishes and food. (The van has a great deal of storage space &#8212; and we used all of it.)<br />
Across from the sink, on the navigator&#8217;s side, is the toilet. This is a manual flush system, requiring the user to step on a pedal to flush the toilet. The toilet was contained in a two by six foot cabinet, with doors that swung out to create a barrier across the van for privacy. Also in the cabinet was the shower curtain and shower head. None of these were ever used during our trip, we made use of the showers at the KOAs we stayed at. In the middle of the ceiling of the kitchen area was ceiling fan and skylight. The fan had a thermostat which could be set with a dial to keep the fan going until the interior was a comfortable temperature.<br />
Behind the kitchen at the back of the van was the main bunk. Normally, it appeared as an L-shaped couch. In front of the couch in the floor was hole for another table, which we rarely set up. When unfolded, the couch became a double bed, just wide enough to fit most people stretched out. Just below the couch was the furnace for those cold mornings, and above it the air-conditioner for those hot nights. Like the microwave, the air-conditioner required a 110 volt system.<br />
The interior of the van was finished with a deep blue carpet with matching seats. The walls were a light grey fabric resembling office dividers (though not quite so visually unpleasant &#8230; that&#8217;s assuming you find woven grey polyester appealing). All of the cabinets and doors were either solid oak or oak-laminated particle board, stained a nice medium brown, kind of an &#8220;off-coffee-with-double-cream-and-sugar&#8221;. The counter top in the kitchen was white. The ceiling was white vinyl (resembling those really bad car seats from the 70&#8217;s), with three windows at the front of the raised roof.<br />
Following the tour, we unloaded Dhar&#8217;s Ford Probe, putting most of the contents into the van. The remainder came with them back into the house. After setting the alarm, I informed my guests not to open any of the doors during the night, or face the music (or the siren, depends if the wailing suits your musical tastes or not).<br />
I took Stefan and Rebecca downstairs to the TV room (so named because that&#8217;s where my friends and I watched endless hours of Star Trek, the X-Files, and the Simpsons), where we had our fold-out bed (a necessity in any family). Dhar was given the option of having a room all to himself for the evening, namely my sister&#8217;s room (my sister was finishing school in Ottawa at the time, and wouldn&#8217;t be home until we were well on our way). In less than five minutes, Dhar was settled in.<br />
I continued to run about for the next half-hour, assembling what remained of the things I was bringing, retrieved the sleeping bag, put out my pack sack of clothes, the CDs, books and so forth in the front hall. By the time I was done it was almost 02:00, and I was exhausted. I knew that the next day was going to be a long one, so I headed to bed. Unfortunately, I could hardly sleep. I was too excited. A long awaited trip was about to begin, and I so desperately wanted to leave.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entire scenario began back in the heady days of what most university students refer to as &#8220;spring break&#8221;. In many cases, this involves an exodus from the country (Canada) to a warmer climate for approximately one week of drinking, frolicking, debauchery, and general mayhem. In our case, it was a break from classes to allow us to get caught up in the work we hadn&#8217;t yet started.<br />
It was also the time that friends of mine had set aside to bring their wedding party together. Scott E.<!--lliott--> and Teresa D.<!--unat--> had approximately eleven or twelve people in their wedding party, and arranged to have eleven of them meet in Kitchener for a few hours of introductions and too much food. Stefan S.<!--cherer-->, like myself, had been drafted as one of Scott&#8217;s groomsmen.<br />
Both Stefan and Rebecca J.<!--ohnston--> were long-time friends of Scott, remembering him back to when the three of them were in high school in Rainy River in northern Ontario. Rebecca wasn&#8217;t a part of the wedding party per se, but attended the party as part of the invitation and to visit with friends.<br />
During the course of the evening (which involved many games, some of which gave us unexpected, albeit humourous, insights into certain people&#8217;s sex lives), Stefan asked me what I had planned to do at the end of the term. I replied that I had no single thing in mind outside of starting my job. It was then that the idea of a road trip was first suggested. But unlike many other road trips that my friends or I had experienced, this was to be a voyage of an entirely different breed.<br />
Over the course of the next two months, about a hundred email messages passed between the inboxes and outboxes of Rebecca, Stefan, and myself, all intended to coordinate and plan the first vacation I would see in over 5 years. The logistics at times seemed to be a nightmare, and more than once the trip came on the verge of getting canceled. But in the end, the pieces fell together, and the plan came to fruition.<br />
But before you continue any further, you should learn more about who I was traveling with. (It&#8217;s kind of important, seeing as I played as much a role in the whole fiasco as them.) Unlike some of my previous excursions, this cast is a small one, so you can come to get to know these people much better and much quicker.<br />
I first met Rebecca J.<!--ohnston--> in the summer of 1992, when I was working for Digital Equipment of Canada Ltd. in Ottawa. One night I was visiting with Scott at his place in Nepean (Scott was working for the Federal Government at the time), when the door bell rang. A moment later Stefan, Rebecca, and Eric walked in the room. Eric is Rebecca&#8217;s son, though not by Stefan (Eric&#8217;s father is often euphemistically referred to as &#8220;The Sperm Donor&#8221;).<br />
I must admit that at first I was immediately attracted to Rebecca &#8212; she is a very beautiful woman. When I later learned of Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s relationship, I put aside any attraction for Rebecca (it&#8217;s a personal policy of mine not to interfere in other&#8217;s relationships). This relationship has since culminated with her second child (and Stefan&#8217;s first), a darling girl named Thea.<br />
Rebecca is a strong woman: physically, mentally, and emotionally. Strong willed and highly intelligent, it&#8217;s hard to wage a battle of the wits with her &#8212; unless you happen to be well educated and open-minded, you are bound to lose. Having graduated from Queen&#8217;s University in Kingston with a degree in Women&#8217;s Studies, Rebecca pursued volunteer work at the &#8220;Sex Clinic&#8221; where until just prior to the trip she was its director. A full-time position as mother and wife with a husband still in school, Rebecca also searched for a full-time paying job. At the time of the trip, Rebecca was 22 years old.<br />
All I new of Dharmendra N.<!--oorhasan--> prior to the trip was that he was one of Stefan&#8217;s male classmates, and had a penchant for computers and cars (which according to Rebecca, was all that Dhar and Stefan ever spoke of). Beyond that, I knew nothing of what would eventually become a compatriot on our tour of the Midwest.<br />
Like any Queen&#8217;s engineering student I have ever met, Dhar (as he preferred to be called) was well versed in cars. (This habit among engineers is still mostly a mystery to me &#8212; even Computer Engineers seem to know far too much about their Honda Preludes.) As Rebecca predicted, Stefan and Dhar talked at length of cars throughout the trip, despite regular protests from Rebecca (often in the form of a change in topic). Dhar was also a computer wizard, having already designed several networks for the Federal Government of Canada.<br />
His parentage of African origin, Dhar was a naturalized Canadian, and like many Canadians he hated the winter. From his parents he developed his taste for spicy food, a taste that unfortunately was never truly satisfied during the trip &#8212; even a true Cajun dish in New Orleans couldn&#8217;t bring tears to his eyes or sweat to his brow. Dhar was 26 at the time of the trip.<br />
I met Stefan S.<!--cherer--> at the same time I met Rebecca. Admittedly, I got along with Stefan much better than I did Rebecca at first, but that was due to two things: a sharing of common interests, and my discomfort around Rebecca (a result of my aforementioned attraction &#8212; I was a very shy person back then).<br />
Stefan first came to Canada from Germany at the age of 12. He quickly learned the English language and many of the customs. Even today he makes the odd slip of the tongue (although I&#8217;ve never caught one), and gets confused when he hears German then tries to speak English, but his efforts to fit in are awe-inspiring.<br />
Stefan possesses many qualities about him that I admire, not the least of which is his complete and utter devotion to his family &#8212; both his parent&#8217;s family and the one he has with Rebecca. I can only hope that should I ever reach the stage where I am to become a parent, I can possess as much love and strength for my family as Stefan has for his.<br />
Stefan was finishing his second-last year of his Electrical Engineering program at Queen&#8217;s University, and greatly looking forward to getting out. Many times he complained about the style of education he received there, and many times wished that he had gone to the University of Waterloo instead. Stefan was 21at the time of the trip.<br />
Lastly there was me, the Observer. More formally, I am Geoff Sowrey. At the time of the trip, I was 23 years old, having completed 98% of my university education. I won&#8217;t give you any description of me, I figure that as you read this incantation you will learn who and what I am.</p>
