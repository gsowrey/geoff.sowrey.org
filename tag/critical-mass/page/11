	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is a hard-working company. And Ted (our founder and corporate Chairman) knows it. To &#8220;thank&#8221; us for all the grief he puts us through, he closes (more or less) the office for two days, packs us off to some remote part of the country, and gets us all horribly drunk &#8212; and he pays for everything. It might be good to be king, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be a peasant every once in a while.<br />
Critical Mass starts planning &#8220;The Trip&#8221;, as it&#8217;s usually referred to, about four months early. It&#8217;s a fairly involved excursion, and when you consider the attendance (at least this year) is about 300 people, there&#8217;s a fair bit of coordination involved. We have two people who work on it nearly full-time, in addition to their regular jobs. And then there&#8217;s a team of about 10 people (representing the various departments in the company) who help in the decision making for things such as, well, the beer labels.<br />
Yes, beer labels. This was something I participated in. We had a beer label competition. If you buy enough beer from the Big Rock Brewery here in Calgary, you can make your own special labels for the event. When I first heard about the opportunity to see if I could out-design the Design department, I leapt a the chance. I came in second. Behind Adrian. A guy who works in Design. Oh well, maybe next year.<br />
We arrived at Critical Mass on Thursday morning with bags in hand, ready for the nine-odd hour trip to Westbank, British Columbia. (For those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of Westbank, it&#8217;s a little south of Kelowna, on the east side of Lake Okanagan.) Luckily, we were not taking school busses (I can only imaging the agony of sitting in those for more than three hours at a time) &#8212; were taking Greyhound.<br />
The busses started arriving around 8:00am. We were told they would arrive at 7:30am. This was a tactic to make sure we all were there on time. As it stands, the fourth (and last) bus didn&#8217;t arrive until nearly 8:45, and we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 9:00 (despite the threatened 8:30 departure time). Again, all of this was planned with an iota of experience &#8212; I assume they had problems last year, and figured it would be worse this time around.<br />
Luckily, our Greyhound busses came equipped with all the modern conveniences: Reclining seats, air conditioning, and a VCR with two TVs. That meant movies. And what better movies to travel with than the Indiana Jones trilogy? Well, if you&#8217;re Mike (on of my co-workers, and a huge fan of independent films), it also includes &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221;. Mike, it seems, was the only one really interested in it. I would have preferred to see &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#8221; instead, which was bumped when Mike beat us to the VCR.<br />
We made three stops along the way &#8212; a quick one at some rest stop, one at Golden for lunch, and a third one in some rinky-dink place north of Vernon so all the smokers on the busses wouldn&#8217;t shake it apart from nic-fits. Every time we had a stop, Pat (whom we labelled &#8220;Bus Masta P&#8221; &#8212; he was in charge of all the busses) got stressed out trying to keep everyone on schedule by getting them back on. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll willingly do that again next year.<br />
We arrived at the Cove Resort around 5:30pm PDT. Now, before you get all &#8220;oooh, a resort!&#8221;, this is at best a word that would describe the long-term plans. There&#8217;s no shuffleboard, no sailboats, no beach &#8212; not even anything remotely resembling a restaurant. It&#8217;s an old farm converted to 26 cabins and a small motel-like building. My cabin, in fact, used to be the farm house. Even all those cabins couldn&#8217;t house our bulk &#8212; we needed the large field to accommodate an additional 20 or so tents.<br />
There were no real plans that evening, aside from getting settled (which took a while &#8212; we had a lot of stuff to unload from the busses), eat (which we did, around 7:00 that evening), drink (which we did in abundance), and relax (which came after the aforementioned drinking). Many of us congregated at Cabin #6, home of the Conners Brothers and Colin &#8212; a perfect recipe for trouble, especially when four tenters were regularly crashing on the cabin floor rather than sleeping outside. Cabin #6 became legend by the following morning.<br />
I didn&#8217;t rise until nearly 1pm, opting to catch up on a lot of sleep. The day was warm and sunny, and people were milling about. I headed to the main tent, where I hoped lunch was being served (I didn&#8217;t really know what time it was, I didn&#8217;t know for most of the weekend). I was in luck &#8212; lunch was slowly beginning to end, and snatching up a meal was as simple as walking up to the table and taking whatever I wanted.<br />
The day was slow and lazy &#8212; the way a day should be. Others went off in search of amenities such as McDonald&#8217;s and Starbucks. I went off in search of things I could watch. I opted not to actually participate in anything, trying not to do anything physically active at all. (This was a conscious decision &#8230; it came right after I realized I&#8217;d forgotten my swimsuit.) There were plenty of things for me to watch &#8212; people were playing sports all over the place, including horseshoes, bocce, volleyball, soccer, and touch football.<br />
The &#8220;major&#8221; event of the day was the wakeboarding demonstration. Ted (who lives barely five minutes from the Resort) is basically a big kid, and is always looking for new toys and things to do. (This is why we also had a houseboat that would take us on short rides on the lake, and Ted took extreme pleasure in whipping people around in his new super-fast powerboat.) Ted hired professional wakeboarders (some of whom had placed as high as fifth in Wakestock, the wakeboarding championships) to not only show us what they could do, but teach others to do it as well.<br />
The demonstration sucked.<br />
Okay, to be fair, they were good. The only problem was that their best demonstration was nearly half a kilometre away, and nearly impossible to see. Our cheering could be best described as &#8220;reserved&#8221;.<br />
Hamburgers were on the menu that night. We were lucky &#8212; our meals were provided by a catering company (who did an excellent job). Last year, those who went on the trip were preparing their own meals. Relaxation is much easier when you only need to show up and eat.<br />
Entertainment for the first night in Westbank was courtesy of several &#8220;amateur&#8221; (though they certainly sound professional) DJs who work in various parts of the company. The second night&#8217;s entertainment was also musical, but certainly more &#8230; interesting.<br />
Karaoke.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;You did karaoke??&#8221; Well, *I* didn&#8217;t do karaoke, but just about everyone else did. Why didn&#8217;t I? Aside from a terminal case of stage fright, I also happen to be extremely self-conscious about my inability to sing. Hey, when you take a jab at yourself in front of your friends (such as &#8220;I sing horribly&#8221;), and they don&#8217;t respond the way friends normally do (such as &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not *that* bad&#8221;), you know you suck.<br />
Mike (the guy with the independent film fetish) was anxious to get on stage and show his stuff. (Mike&#8217;s a little weird.) He wasn&#8217;t the first on stage. That was Geoff Mackenzie.<br />
Geoff&#8217;s a character. (Must be in the name.) He was dressed in jeans (pants and jacket), a somewhat-loud cowboy-like shirt, and a corduroy cowboy hat. The first song of the evening was &#8220;Stand By Your Man&#8221;. And no, he didn&#8217;t change the lyrics one bit. Geoff&#8217;s performance (with heavy doses of ham) set the tone for the evening, and it went downhill from there.<br />
Chris (my roommate, friend, and fellow troublemaker) was up shortly after Geoff. Chris erupted onto the stage with an opening that went somewhat like this: &#8220;Aight, they didn&#8217;t have any NWA, so instead, this one goes out to all my Critical Mass niggaz and all my Critical Mass shortys. Let&#8217;s roll up on this motherf***er&#8230;&#8221; He did Lionel Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Easy (Like Sunday Morning)&#8221;. With audience participation. Shannon, another of my co-workers who knows Chris, was sitting on the balcony outside his motel room (there was a motel-like building that housed another six rooms of people) was duly impressed with Chris&#8217; performance. It led to a return to the stage for a duet with Rob (who&#8217;s in Design, I think) to do &#8220;Ebony and Ivory&#8221;. Rob and Chris lapped up the audience&#8217;s appreciation.<br />
During a needed sprint back to my cabin (bathroom break), I missed the opening of one of the headlining acts for the night: Ted and Dewi. They brought their own music (they figured the karaoke company wouldn&#8217;t have the song they wanted to do) &#8212; Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;Larger Than Life&#8221;. Only they had help &#8212; four others who did the now-famous chair dance while Ted and Dewi crooned. (I should point out that this was not only set up well in advance, but the chair dancers practiced their moves before strutting their stuff in public.) The audience might as well have been from an actual Backstreet Boys concert from the amount of screaming and cheering&#8230;<br />
Geoff came back for another round of fun, performing that Johnny Cash classic, &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;. You&#8217;d never think so many people would be so into karaoke. I guess it all depends on who&#8217;s up performing. I think I have a whole new appreciation for that brand of entertainment. For example, we staged the first ever Tiffany mosh pit when two singing souls (Steve and Andrew) did their rendition of &#8220;I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now&#8221;. It was a sign of things to come.<br />
Anyway, Geoff stole the show again, and then managed to get everyone in the tent to break a few hundred noise by-laws by screaming at the top of their lungs. I think my Aunt Alaine and Uncle David (who live on the other side of the lake) could probably have heard us that evening. Luckily, the cops never showed up.<br />
The fight for the limelight also included Shawn Conners (one of the Conners Brothers). Shawn is about as perfect a specimen of a (pardon the language) &#8220;shit disturber&#8221; as I have ever met. He is also an artiste (note the extra &#8216;e&#8217;) and the biggest honey-glazed ham I have ever had the pleasure to have known. He and Colin did a great version of Milli Vanilli&#8217;s &#8220;Blame It On The Rain&#8221;. But Shawn wasn&#8217;t content with a simple singing version &#8212; he had to go that one step further and dump a bottle of water on himself (very much like in &#8220;Flashdance&#8221; &#8212; I still think they should have been doing &#8220;What A Feeling&#8221;) while striking an overly-dramatic pose.<br />
I made a hasty departure when Dave and his posse started singing &#8220;American Pie&#8221;. Keith&#8217;s a great singer, but it was a riot just waiting to happen. I hung out at the fire pit for a while, talking with some of the people who had fled the chaos, before retreating to Cabin #6 sometime around 1am, after the karaoke had broken down into a rave.<br />
I woke earlier the next morning and found my way to the big tent, where others were waiting for lunch. Breakfast had just ended, but I didn&#8217;t miss anything (muffins and fruit salad every morning were not enough of a reason for me to get up early). Lunch that day were smokies, and the tent was packed with hungry people waiting to eat.<br />
The afternoon was relaxed again. Some people slept, many others disappeared into town again, in search of amenities. Several went to see &#8220;X-Men&#8221; playing at the local cheapie theatre. I wandered around, talked with people, watched others try to wakeboard, sat around the campfire (which I think never went out from the moment it was lit), and watched others play cards.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t bored. Boredom comes when you want to do something, but are unable to determine what it is you want to do. I was trying to avoid activity. I was letting my mind turn to mush for a while. By purposely not thinking or doing anything, I was letting myself relax. I haven&#8217;t done it in a very long time, and it was hugely relaxing.<br />
One thing that required the use of my brain somewhat was reading the paper. Someone had left a copy of the Vancouver Sun on the table in my cabin, and I figured I&#8217;d see what was going down in the Lower Mainland. Aside from a massive sewer rupture spilling millions of litres of untreated sewage into Burrard Inlet, it seemed that not much had changed since I left &#8212; same political name-calling, same sports successes, and school was back in session (you know it&#8217;s a slow news day when&#8230;) It was very comforting to read a newspaper &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t read one since I was staying at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s here in Calgary.<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating one bit. While the previous day had been nice (although the night had been quite cold), we had bursts of rain for most of the day. Although right before dinner, we found ourselves gazing at the largest and most vivid double-rainbow I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve never seen a complete rainbow before, either &#8212; usually the top or either end is missing, but this one was a complete 180-degree arc. It was awe-inspiring. The joke that immediately followed was a query about how much Ted paid to have a rainbow appear before dinner.<br />
Our last supper in Westbank was steak and salmon, with baked potatoes and Caesar salad. Those of us who could, pigged out. Aside from the bones, it was great. (Although we apparently ran out of salmon, and I feel a little guilty for getting as much as I did. Only a little &#8212; it was Pacific salmon, after all.)<br />
Dessert was a special one that night. It was Ted&#8217;s birthday, and we had three cakes to spread around. Two of the cakes bore our Critical Mass propaganda logo, the third bore a relief sculpture of a caricature of Ted&#8217;s face. In icing. It was beautiful &#8230; and the artist (Mark Gervais) didn&#8217;t get fired for it.<br />
It was Caribbean night. This meant loud polyester shirts, shorts, and lots and lots and lots and lots of booze. (We went through between 9,000 and 13,000 pounds of booze in the weekend.) The Caribbean music (although good), lasted only long enough to get Ted (who was a little past plastered) to take a few swings at a piñata. Then the DJs got back into their swing, and the rave got going again. This was probably the most intense it had been since we got there, but most people realized that this was their last night to really let loose. And most of them did.<br />
Not being a dancer, nor finding anything else to do at that point, I found myself back at the fire pit again. Our group of six (comprising nearly every level and department in the company) engaged in hearty conversation. Our numbers soon swelled, when Ted arrived. (Wherever Ted goes, people go. It&#8217;s either an Einsteinian thing where people flow to the gravity well formed by Ted&#8217;s immense power, or they&#8217;re drawn like moths to candle flames. Either way, we soon had a lot of people.<br />
Ted was a little dismayed to find it was only 10:50. He had hoped it was 12:50. He wanted to go home, but thought it would be &#8230; well, wimpy of him to leave before 1am. Ted was wiped &#8212; the day had really taken a dent out of him, and he had two more hours to survive. Soon, there were about 50 people around the fire, and I&#8217;d lost my seat.<br />
Around midnight, the Rave Revolt began. First it started with Ted commenting that they&#8217;d played the same song for over three hours. Dan went over to &#8220;correct&#8221; the problem. He reported back (sans a change in music) saying Dewi protested, offering a change after &#8220;the first set&#8221;. Some of the more &#8220;senior&#8221; people (those over the age of 35) didn&#8217;t much like this answer. Ted decided it was time for action, and walked back towards the tent, muttering something about &#8220;Christmas bonuses&#8221;. A few minutes later, lyrics returned to the music, and the beat was noticeably different.<br />
It&#8217;s something that I think the older folk don&#8217;t quite understand. Rave music is meant to have a single beat that lasts for hours. It&#8217;s a challenge to keep the beat while changing the songs. The beat, although important, isn&#8217;t everything &#8212; melodies change, different layers of sound are woven in and out, even some lyrics thrown in for good measure. But it&#8217;s a sign of a skilled DJ who can make several hours of music sound like one song.<br />
By about 2:30 in the morning, there were only nine: Chris, myself, Ben, Adrian, Virgil, Mike (different Mike), Teak, Simone, and Marcie. We talked. All night. Our first major topic of conversations was 80s TV themes. Ben is the King of 80s TV. He knows the themes from virtually every TV show that aired from 1979 to 1991, except the really obscure ones like Automan, Manimal, Outlaws, and The Highwayman (bonus points to you if you a) even remember what they were, and double points if b) you can describe them.)<br />
Marcie and Simone left shortly before we finished that topic, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s time for bed&#8221;. Adrian suggested we do movie quotes &#8212; you give the quote, and the rest had to guess it. Chris and I had a decided advantage, having a) watched about a billion movies, and b) spent a great deal of time memorizing lines. For everyone who thought we were wasting our time, I offer you the fruits of our labour. Of course, Chris and I were always telling each other not to speak up, because we knew that the other would know the quote.<br />
Yeah, yeah, we act like we&#8217;re married. Like we haven&#8217;t heard that a thousand times before. It doesn&#8217;t help that we&#8217;ve been good friends for 13 years.<br />
Somewhere around 3:30am, Simone and Marcie returned to our circle, not having made it to bed. They&#8217;d been distracted by another social gathering elsewhere (assumedly not one as geeky as ours), but instead of going to bed when it broke up, they came back to us. (So I guess we&#8217;re not that geeky. No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
Somewhere around 4:00am or so, it began to rain. A lot. It was the sort of rain you knew would get you utterly soaked. And with the wind picking up, it was going to get us cold very quickly. We retreated to the big tent. We flipped on the lights, cranked up the heater, and returned to our little games. Ben bailed on us about 30 minutes later, leaving just the Group of Eight.<br />
When morning finally arrived, we started the process of getting ready to leave. Chris and I showered, packed, and hauled our stuff out to the Resort office porch, awaiting arrival of the busses. We then ate breakfast (muffins and fruit salad) and watched the sun come up. Figures that the day we leave good weather returns to Westbank.<br />
When the busses showed up, people started jumping on them. That started trouble. People (in general) are stupid. People don&#8217;t think about big pictures, what needs to be done, bla bla bla. That&#8217;s why we have visionaries. And anal retentive busy-bodies. (They&#8217;re often one-in-the-same, but that&#8217;s another long essay.) This is when I called upon the bus leaders to get their acts in gear, or we weren&#8217;t getting all the sound equipment, leftovers, and tents onto the busses.<br />
Chrissie (now the designated Bus Master), quickly knighted me and gave me the power to order others around. Holding everyone else back, we loaded our leftovers and whatnot onto the busses before letting everyone else suck up the rest of the space with their belongings. Packing took about 30 minutes.<br />
Chris was nowhere in sight. Having made mention to it earlier in the day (or later in the night before, take your choice), he had probably grabbed a seat with Marcie. (I would find out I was right after our first stop in Revelstoke.) I was seated behind Yasmin, one of our new people &#8212; she&#8217;s an Information Architect, and in front of Rich, one of our Project Managers. Along with most of the bus, we slept most of the way back to Calgary.<br />
We watched three movies: &#8220;Dumb and Dumber&#8221;, &#8220;Big Trouble In Little China&#8221;, and part of &#8220;True Lies&#8221;. When I was awake, I wasn&#8217;t watching the movies most of the time &#8212; I was watching the scenery. The day was so bright, and I wasn&#8217;t driving, that I got my first really good look at the sights to be seen in the mountains. There were a few times that I wished I could have stopped the bus just so I could look around.<br />
Arriving in Calgary, chaos ensued when we unloaded. But soon Chris and I were safe and sound at home. Overall, it was a great weekend, except for the 18 hours spent on the road. Those were a little more tedious. But I can think of worse things &#8212; 18 hours across the Prairies, for example.<br />
This morning, people were tired, foggy, semi-unconcious &#8212; basically everything you&#8217;d expect from such a weekend. Productivity will take a day or two to get back to normal. Whatever normal is&#8230;<br />
One last note: It was minus one this morning as I walked to work. The shorts are gone, the fleece is out, and the sandals are bare moments from being packed away. Summer is definitely over.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It all started when I received an email during my stay in Cincinnati. (This was a couple of weeks ago, obviously.) It was entitled &#8220;Kicking Horse Blazing Paddles&#8221;. It was a call for those interested in experiencing the adrenaline of whitewater rafting on the Kicking Horse River.<br />
I need not mention that I was interested&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;d never been whitewater rafting before, but I knew a few people who had, and they all loved it. So, naturally, my curiosity was piqued enough to be interested, and certainly the opportunity to try something more invigorating than a rollercoaster was enthralling. I had my named added to the list of other half-suicidal CMassers.<br />
As it turned out, there would only be six of us: Sean (who organized the trip), his brother Robin, Shannon, Sara, and Sara&#8217;s significant other, Brett. We had hoped for eight, at which point we could get a group discount, but we settled with our six and hoped for the best trip we could get under the circumstances.<br />
What about Chris? Well, Chris has a love/hate relationship with water. He doesn&#8217;t much like it outside of showers (although he&#8217;s taken up a healthy swimming regiment as of late). He also hates the cold. Really hates the cold. Loathes the cold. His response to my invitation to join us was:</p>
<blockquote><p>HAHAHAAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH.<br />
Ha.<br />
Your [sic] a funny f&#8211;king lad&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We met early Saturday morning in the Critical Mass parking lot. Sean and his brother would drive in one car, Shannon and I in my car, and Sara and Brett in their SUV. Sean informed us that morning that we might in fact be late &#8212; there was the possibility that the drive could take upwards of four hours. Our trip was scheduled for noon. We were going to have to move fast.<br />
We left the parking lot, turned onto 10th Ave. SW, turned up 8th St., and then onto 6th Ave. Robin led us out to Sarcee Trail, which then took us to 16th Ave. (aka Trans Canada Highway), and then out of the city. For the next two hours, we stuck together like glue: Robin and Sean in front, Shannon and I in the middle, and Sara and Brett picking up the rear. This wasn&#8217;t particularly easy, since we hit speeds as high as 140 km/h making sure we got to our destination in time.<br />
Our destination was the Kootenay River Runners company, located on the Kicking Horse River about halfway between Field, BC and Golden, BC. This would be my first trip into British Columbia in almost four months. Admittedly, I was a little apprehensive at first, but I cast aside that irrational fear and plunged headlong&#8230;<br />
&#8230;into rain.<br />
Lots of it. Figures &#8212; I was going to BC, after all.<br />
It rained from almost the moment we left Calgary until just after we&#8217;d crossed the Kicking Horse Pass. So in a strange way, it wasn&#8217;t really raining *in* BC. Odd, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
The trip there was marked with Shannon and I discussing favourite movies, and me giving a brief history of Canadian development in the Rockies to Shannon. He didn&#8217;t know a lot about the area, and I guess I know more than I should. But he seemed interested, and (as most of you who know me will testify) I like to talk.<br />
We arrived at the Kootenay River Runner&#8217;s Whitewater Ranch at about 11:15 &#8212; way ahead of everyone else. We were listed as &#8220;early&#8221;. This gave us the chance to look around a little. The Whitewater Ranch is not as fancy as it sounds. Basically, it&#8217;s nothing more than a large shed (which houses most of the equipment and two washroom/change rooms), a couple of miscellaneous sheds, a half-completed barbecue shelter, and a large section of flood plain where the rafts waited to whisk us downriver.<br />
My first stop (after using the toilet) was to the river. The Kicking Horse River, like most of the rivers in the Rockies, is a glacial river. English translation: Frickin&#8217; cold. About one degree Celsius. Yes Virginia, it&#8217;s that cold. The river isn&#8217;t clear &#8212; it&#8217;s powder blue. This is from all the ice crystals suspended in the water. (This is also why glacial lakes, like Lake Louise, are blue.) And yes, it was very cold.<br />
People soon started arriving, and we opted to change into our rafting wear: Bathing suits and t-shirts. I gave up my sandals for my winter boots (basically over-grown shoes), as I wasn&#8217;t too keen on putting my bare feet into that river at any time. The guides (specifically one guy who we learned was called &#8220;Rhino&#8221; &#8212; he never told us why he was called that) and given the low-down on equipment.<br />
Our attire would not be limited to our swimsuits and t-shirts, for obvious reasons. (Namely, we&#8217;d develop hypothermia in less than a minute in these waters). Our first layer would be a swimsuit (or nothing at all), on top of which would be a wet suit. It wasn&#8217;t a full wetsuit, the top looked like neoprene overalls. On top of that would go a nylon fleece top, and a &#8220;spray jacket&#8221; on top of that (basically a slightly rubberized nylon shell). On top of that would be our life jacket. Our feet would have either neoprene &#8220;socks&#8221; or boots (or shoes, for those of us who couldn&#8217;t get the socks or boots). Lastly would be a helmet, so we wouldn&#8217;t knock ourselves silly on the rocks &#8230; or each other.<br />
Suiting up didn&#8217;t take too long, although some people had problems with the wetsuits, and one guy near me could not get the small fleece top over his extra large body. It was quite amusing to watch, though.<br />
After tossing our things onto one of two buses (we were only doing the Upper Kicking Horse portion of the river; roughly half of the group was also doing the Lower portion), we headed down to the river. There we got the safety speech. This is important. This is where you learn the basics of whitewater survival. Most of the time, you probably don&#8217;t need this speech &#8212; it&#8217;s for the worst-case scenarios.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we got it.<br />
The six of us ended up on raft #17. It&#8217;s a SOTAR (&#8220;State Of The Art Raft&#8221;), which basically means short of a nuclear blast, it&#8217;ll survive almost anything the river can offer. Our guide, Eric, was a nine-year veteran of river guiding, and had been guiding on this river for several years. He drove in from Vegreville (about five hours away) every weekend to send another group of hapless weekend warriors downriver to experience the thrill of freezing to death.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s not *that* bad&#8230;<br />
Before boarding, we had to finish adjusting our lifejackets. Most people who use them (not all do) wear them pretty loosely. In most cases, this is probably fine. However, if you&#8217;re going whitewater rafting, particularly in such cold water, the lifejacket has to be tight &#8230; so tight it&#8217;s difficult to breathe. Why? Because if you fall out of the boat, they use the jacket to haul you back in. Eric had to tie Sara&#8217;s jacket on extra tight &#8212; she&#8217;s not a large person, and she was swimming inside the flotation device.<br />
We piled in, Shannon and I in the bow, Brett and Sara behind us, Eric in the middle, Sean and Robin behind him, and a recently-married elderly couple behind them (I only learned the man&#8217;s name, Neil). After a quick shove-off, we started our journey.<br />
Eric reiterated the safety speech, just to make sure we all understood what was going on. He then sent us through some simple drills. Forward and backward paddling, alternating sides paddling, diving to one side or the other &#8212; basic things to get us down river. The key was to paddle in sync, which meant Shannon and I would spend more time watching each other than the river. This would come back to haunt us.<br />
The first portion of the river was fairly tame &#8212; the odd ripple, a couple of nice currents, but nothing major. Then Eric sent us into (what I guess is) a Class II rapid. Shannon and I got soaked. It was cold. Really cold. But unlike jumping into cold water and starting to hyperventilate, it wasn&#8217;t paralysing. After a couple of moments, the water warmed a bit (as a wetsuit is supposed to) and it became less uncomfortable. Sara, who was sitting behind me, wasn&#8217;t quite as comfortable &#8212; she hadn&#8217;t done up the collar on her spray jacket and got a few cups of ice-cold water down the front.<br />
About 45 minutes after leaving Whitewater Ranch, we pulled over at the side of the river for lunch. By this point we were hucking our lifejackets to try and cool off. It was quite warm with those things on so tight. Waiting for us was hot coffee, hot water (with packets of hot chocolate powder), and lunch &#8230; though the guides had to help setting it all up. Soon, lunch was called and we dropped into line to get it.<br />
Lunch was pretty simple &#8212; make-your-own sandwiches, pickles, caesar salad, cantaloupe, and cookies. The website had said there would be a barbecue, but the shelter wasn&#8217;t complete, so we didn&#8217;t get to partake in that. Maybe next time&#8230;<br />
Lunch wasn&#8217;t particularly lavish, but it was filling enough to occupy the voids beginning to form in our stomachs. The group of 60 (or so) filled out the small clearing, munching away and discussing the first leg of the trip. Some of us knew what was in store for the second leg (we&#8217;d already been filled in by co-workers who&#8217;d done the trip the year before), and were excited to get back on the water.<br />
Especially since we were beginning to get cold. The lifejackets were great insulation from the cold, which was now beginning to set in. We couldn&#8217;t wait to get buckled back in and paddling to warm up.<br />
We shifted seats a bit when we headed back out. Shannon moved back to where Sean was sitting, I moved to where Shannon was sitting, and Sean moved to where I was sitting. Didn&#8217;t change much beyond that. I had to switch to the other side because my right arm was beginning to hurt a bit, and I wanted to give my left a chance.<br />
Soon we were off, back into smaller rapids, getting wet, and having fun. Only about five minutes out, we pulled off to the side again. Eric claimed he had to get out and &#8220;get his bearings&#8221;. I think this is code for the guides to figure out where the largest wave is to scare the bejeebers out of the beginners in the raft. We were about to enter Shotgun Alley.<br />
This is a section of the Kicking Horse where rocks have created the most intense rapids in the Upper section of the river. They max out at Class V (out of a maximum of Class X). We couldn&#8217;t see around the corner, and so had no idea what we were about to get into. Eric came back, saying he knew what he was going to do, so loaded us up, and away we went.<br />
Shotgun doesn&#8217;t look as bad as it actually is &#8230; at least from the river. Maybe from above it looks worse, but it&#8217;s hard to tell when your guide is yelling &#8220;Forward Paddle! Forward Paddle!&#8221; and you&#8217;re trying to match your strokes with the guy next to/in front of you.<br />
Suddenly, the powder blue water had turned an angry white. The boat lurched down and a massive wave crashed over the bow, knocking me square in the chest, and into the bottom of the raft. I struggled to get myself back out, but by the time I could, another wave hammered me again. Realizing that there was just no way I could get myself back up on the bow, I stayed inside the boat and hauled my paddle outside and kept paddling.<br />
The boat lurched down and up again, and more ice-cold water briefly blinded me. I flailed with the paddle as best I could, but it was seconds before I could see again. When I did see again, I was quickly wishing I wasn&#8217;t seeing what was about to happen.<br />
Rocks.<br />
Big ones.<br />
Eric, our guide, had either steered us too close to the side of the river (which happened to end in a sheer rock face), or my inability to paddle properly had reduced the power on my side of the boat, steering us in. Can&#8217;t say which, because I honestly don&#8217;t know. Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we still hit solid rock.<br />
Well, &#8220;hit&#8221; isn&#8217;t a good verb. &#8220;Ran aground&#8221; would be more proper, I guess. The rock was sloped, and what&#8217;s what we ran onto. I could feel the rock beneath me as we ran onto it &#8212; but we didn&#8217;t stay there for long. The river&#8217;s current dragged the raft sideways (with the bow acting as the pivot) and then off the rock and down river.<br />
Right into a large Class V rapid known as &#8220;The Terminator&#8221;.<br />
The raft rolled sharply up on it&#8217;s side (my side being the low side). The sudden upward swing catapulted Sean off the raft. Neil, the old guy at the stern, slid off. I, who was still trying to get back on the side to try and paddle, found the side now slipping out from under me. I, too, fell into the icy Kicking Horse River.<br />
We had been told at the safety orientation that when faced with a large rapid that the guide would yell &#8220;hold on&#8221; and we would grab a rope called the &#8220;centre line&#8221; that ran down the length of the raft. However, the call never came, and I didn&#8217;t see the rapid before it was too late. We&#8217;d also been told that in the event that you couldn&#8217;t grab the centre line, there was another rope that ran around the outside of the raft. This was called (and please pardon the language) the &#8220;Oh Shit!&#8221; line, so named because that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re usually yelling as you fall off.<br />
Luckily, my three years in sailing school had ingrained in me a survival instinct to stay with the boat. After my foot slipped out from under the centre line (I had tried to hike myself back in using that method), I reached for the OS line. Brett was immediately at the side of the raft to help me back in. As we were instructed during our training, I brought my paddle hand out of the water to hand them my paddle &#8230; only it wasn&#8217;t there. In the rush of falling out, I somehow had let go of it. Admittedly, it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on my mind at the time.<br />
Brett hauled me back in on the count of three, and we tried to resume a somewhat stable position. My immediate thought was &#8220;Where the heck is Sean?&#8221; &#8212; he wasn&#8217;t there (I didn&#8217;t know at the time that he&#8217;d been thrown clear off). I looked behind us and saw Sean floating some 100 metres away near the side of the river (the side with the sheer cliff).<br />
As we would find out later, Sean was trying to save his butt. He had managed to hang onto his paddle longer than me, but had turfed it in favour of saving himself. The raft behind us had tried to save him with one of the oars, but just as Sean reached for it, a rapid sucked him under. When he came back up, the raft was too far away, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any warmer. Sean saw a tree near the side, and swam for safety.<br />
Unfortunately, this meant that Sean was trapped at the side of a frigid raging river with no obvious way out. He&#8217;d also lost one of his neoprene boots in the chaos. (But he still had his contact lenses and his waterproof camera.) One of the rafts pulled to the same side of the river as Sean, and the guide went back to retrieve our fallen comrade-in-paddles. It was nearly 30 minutes before we saw them in the trees &#8212; we greeted Sean&#8217;s safe return with loud cat calls.<br />
A few minutes later, Sean was returned to our raft. Two paddles were passed forward, and we continued our trip. Sean and I stuck to the bow, unafraid of what would befall us (having already been befallen) and kept taking the waves. About 20 minutes later, we arrived at the end of our trip.<br />
Half of the group was continuing onto the Lower Kicking Horse, but had to leave the river and drive a bit further down. There&#8217;s a stretch between the Upper Kicking Horse and the Lower Kicking Horse that Eric described as &#8220;impassable&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t elaborate.<br />
Eric was called away to guide one of the Lower rafts, so bade us farewell, and darted away. We were left to peel our waterlogged clothes off, and put our dry clothes (which came in the bus) back on.<br />
We would find out that our raft wasn&#8217;t the only one to be taken out by the Terminator. Two other rafts from another company (which had entered the slot not long before us) had flipped. We got off lucky. Eric must have seen the spectacle, and opted not to tell us so that it wouldn&#8217;t get us worried. Luckily, we&#8217;d gone through a flip drill (not actual, but talked through it) in the event that happened.<br />
We changed, put all our wet things into huge piles, and boarded a bus to take us back to Whitewater Ranch. There we got back into our cars and made for the trip home. I had hoped to convince everyone to stop in Banff and go to the Irish pub there for dinner. I didn&#8217;t seem to get any initial takers, but Sean and Robin said they&#8217;d want to stop somewhere. The consensus was to drive back, and we&#8217;d stop somewhere along the way.<br />
Robin and Sean took the lead, and promptly started to disappear. I don&#8217;t know what their hurry was, but the rest of us had a heck of a time trying to keep up. I was cursing them for about an hour until I finally said &#8220;the heck with it&#8221;, and pulled ahead from Sara and Brett, hoping that they might be able to catch up later. Someone had to tell the other two to slow down.<br />
A couple of times I came close, but as soon as I got within honking distance, they pulled ahead and I couldn&#8217;t catch up. It wasn&#8217;t until we got back to a four-lane divided highway that I managed to catch them. Doing 150 km/h. In a 90 km/h zone. (If I&#8217;m *really* lucky, I won&#8217;t get a speeding ticket.)<br />
I chewed them out over the phone about 30 minutes later, after the cell phone signal was restored. Brett and Sara were nowhere in sight. I finally convinced Robin and Sean to pull over and wait. No sooner than we pulled over than Sara and Brett shot by at about 130 km/h. By the time we got back on the road, they were gone. We assume they pulled into Banff.<br />
We did not &#8212; I gave up my Irish stew and Guinness for a Wendy&#8217;s double hamburger and lemonade. Not exactly what I would call a consolation prize &#8230; more like a booby prize.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a lot of fun. And I&#8217;d do it again. I just have to find seven half-suicidal people to go with me&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Be it ever so humble &#8230; and a little messy &#8230; there&#8217;s no place like home.<br />
I missed yesterday&#8217;s log. Oops. Basically, the testing went well &#8212; the changes I made held and so far, things are looking good. That meant I could finally come home. I had to make some near last-minute changes (extending my stay at the Westin, and telling Northwest that I&#8217;d be leaving the following day), but otherwise all was fine.<br />
Actually, the last-minute changes were a little more in my favour &#8212; I had to book an earlier flight because the one I wanted was full. That was fine with me &#8212; I was more interested in coming home.<br />
This morning was mostly involved with updating the testing pages on the staging server, letting the team know which files were &#8220;approved&#8221; and which ones still needed work, and letting them know how to find me. Then it was off to the airport.<br />
If you ever go to Cincinnati Airport, make sure you bring a book. There&#8217;s nothing to look at there, the airport&#8217;s rather dull, and there&#8217;s no store once you pass security. Kinda annoying, if you ask me. Of course, I could have gone back through, but I really couldn&#8217;t be bothered.<br />
I was writing. Not this, but a report that I have to file for what I did. Our client&#8217;s still a little edgy with this so-called solution, so I need to prove it with a nice lengthy document that no-one will read. Fortunately, I&#8217;m good at being verbose. These logs are a testament to that, if nothing else.<br />
I love first class, although I have to admit I feel a little guilty taking it. I know what it&#8217;s like to be peering from steerage into the plushly-furnished curtained area. Unlimited drinks (which admittedly, I didn&#8217;t take advantage of), nicer meals, and big, comfy seats. Very nice.<br />
The flight from Cincinnati to Minneapolis was about an hour and a half, before I got dumped there to catch a connecting flight. During that time I took the opportunity to recharge my laptop&#8217;s battery. It&#8217;s a long life battery, but I wanted it to last the remaining leg of the journey. Northwest doesn&#8217;t show in-flight movies on such &#8220;short haul&#8221; flights, and I had nothing to read. I figured I&#8217;d entertain myself with a report.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain how much I enjoyed seeing the Prairies again. Land that stretches out forever, where it&#8217;s rare that cloud covers everything, where the buffalo used to roam, and the deer and the antelope are hunted for fun.<br />
We passed over Drumheller on our way in (I was amazed that I could recognize it from the air), and sailed smoothly into Calgary. Being the second from the front of the plane, I was the second one off. However, I was the first into Customs, which I blitzed right through. I completely bypassed baggage claim (carry-ons &#8212; it&#8217;s the only way to fly), and tore out the front door. I grabbed the first taxi, and was on my way home.<br />
I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m much more adjusted to the western climate &#8212; it&#8217;s drier here, and I&#8217;m not a big fan of the oppressive humidity of the east. I was very happy not to be sweltering in the heat, and feeling a cool breeze for the first time in over a week.<br />
So if you&#8217;re ever living on the air in Cincinnati, don&#8217;t look for WKRP. It doesn&#8217;t exist. However, there is a WKRC.<br />
No kidding&#8230;</p>

		<p>Today was a good day. Finally.<br />
There&#8217;s nothing quite like the feeling of finally overcoming a problem that&#8217;s kept you up a night, sent you to perhaps the dullest city in mid-eastern America, had you eating mediocre food for a week, and put massive (albeit temporary) dents in your credit cards.<br />
It&#8217;s also good to know that I didn&#8217;t waste my weekend. The problems, not quite all, but most of them, are gone. All the work that I poured into this handy little laptop, not to mention some great backup from Calgary, solved our quandaries. The site&#8217;s working (mostly), and after tomorrow, we&#8217;ll be able to say that the site is solid, and I can finally go home.<br />
I met with John today. He&#8217;s our (Critical Mass&#8217;) account manager for our client. He&#8217;s not much older than me &#8212; I figure 30, tops. Probably from a business school. But he&#8217;s good with clients, and seems pretty good at fighting fires. He was here for his bi-monthly meeting with the client. He knows this city well.<br />
We had an interesting chat after work, over dinner at the Fifth and Vine, an eatery in the corner of the hotel. I gotta tell ya &#8212; he&#8217;s a great guy. He saw the client in pretty much the same way I do. Not to mention the contractors. I got a lot of positive feedback &#8212; he was glad I came. Although not the best candidate, I was good enough to convince some of the contractors that Critical Mass isn&#8217;t all pretty front-ends, and that we do know how to solve hard problems.<br />
Whether or not that keeps going is anyone&#8217;s guess&#8230;<br />
Tomorrow is coding and testing, and then I&#8217;m outta here on Thursday. With luck, I&#8217;ll be at work Friday morning.<br />
If I&#8217;m not, I might start looking for an apartment down here. It&#8217;ll certainly be cheaper than these hotels&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate this city. And Memorial Day. The two of them combined? Well, let me tell you&#8230;<br />
I figured I&#8217;d stay in today and get some work done. Fine, no problem. Or so I thought. I got up later than I&#8217;d planned (probably because I&#8217;d stayed up so late), and so skipped breakfast (which I&#8217;ve done almost every day since I got here). I figured that I&#8217;d make it up with a nice sub.<br />
So I thought.<br />
In Canada, whenever we have a holiday, it&#8217;s a good excuse to go shopping. I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; nearly everything that can be open is usually open. There are exceptions, but more often than not, you can at least find a restaurant, or a Subway, to get a meal.<br />
Not in Cincinnati.<br />
It&#8217;s locked down tighter than a drum. Even the bars are closed. What&#8217;s with that? Since when don&#8217;t Americans want to get drunk on a National Holiday? I thought that was a stereotype, for crying out loud!<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m annoyed.<br />
After wandering around downtown for about an hour, I found ONE open store or restaurant. Arby&#8217;s. I won&#8217;t touch Arby&#8217;s for all the roast beef in England. Can&#8217;t do it. Won&#8217;t do it. I hate Arby&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve eaten there twice, and hated it both times.<br />
So I figured I&#8217;d eat at one of the hotel&#8217;s restaurants. They closed at 1:50pm. They don&#8217;t open again until 5pm. What the heck kind of service is that??<br />
Oh yeah, there&#8217;s room service &#8230; if you want to pay US$15 for a lousy hamburger. For US$15, I can get a bottomless soft drink, a beer (a wheat beer, not some mega-swill), a huge gourmet hamburger (made to order) with cheese and bacon, fries, and a caesar salad. That&#8217;s at the Rock Bottom. I&#8217;d just as soon go there &#8230; but it&#8217;s closed.<br />
So I&#8217;m eating a Snickers bar and holding out until 6pm.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to go home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was my day off. It didn&#8217;t start that way &#8212; I was figuring on getting a lot of work in, but as I went out to scout for lunch, I decided that the day was nice enough that I would take a little walk. My logic says that if I take today off, I can work my keister off for the next 36 hours and still get the job done and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
In theory, at least.<br />
My goal was the Cincinnati Museum Center. It sounded like a really neat place to check out, and it was about the only thing in walking distance that I wanted to see.<br />
I walked up to 9th Street before heading west. Along the way, I passed examples of architecture from just about every period since the mid-to-late 1800s. Gerry would love this city.<br />
The weather was threatening rain, amidst bursts of sunshine. The forecast was for thunderstorms, but I never heard even so much as a slight rumble. Heck, it barely rained in the entire time I was walking about. Which was good, because I had neither an umbrella or a raincoat. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to go anywhere where I would be horribly out of place showing up soaked.<br />
According to the maps I&#8217;d read, all I had to do was cross I-75 on 9th Street, turn onto Gest Road, and walk up to Western Road. Unfortunately, maps seldom match reality. For starters, 9th Street doesn&#8217;t actually cross I-75 &#8212; 8th Street does. Although 8th Street doesn&#8217;t actually connect with the road that crosses I-75. Doesn&#8217;t make sense, does it? Well, considering the city has no movie theatres downtown and no stores open past 9pm (the Subway closes at 5pm on weekends!), it fits the pattern.<br />
When you get to the other side of the I-75, you&#8217;ll find that Gest doesn&#8217;t actually intersect with the road you&#8217;re walking on. It&#8217;s pseudo-parallel. And Western? I don&#8217;t think it meets Gest, either &#8230; although I could have just missed it without realizing.<br />
You can see the Cincinnati Museum Center even before you&#8217;ve reached the other side of the bridge. It&#8217;s that big. It took me about ten minutes to get there from the bridge, and when I got there, I realized that I had another five minutes of having to walk around so I could actually get in. (I came down towards the side, which has a road that goes under the parking lot.)<br />
The Cincinnati Museum Center is also known as Cincinnati Union Station. It was built in 1931 to handle the massive passenger rail traffic that used to run through the city. The station was huge. Its centre is a huge quarter sphere, with the flat side facing the front. The curved portion forms the massive rotunda of the complex. It&#8217;s a very dramatic art deco style. Gerry would love this building. So would Stuart, I think.<br />
I like the art deco style. I&#8217;d even go so far as to say I&#8217;m an art deco revivalist. Maybe it&#8217;s because I think the style is elegant, maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not concrete. Sometimes I think I long for the era that spawned art deco &#8212; the days when rail travel was king, when technology was the newest radio.<br />
Then again, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to write these logs as easily&#8230;<br />
The museum has four exhibits: The Cincinnati Museum in the south wing, the Natural History Museum in the north wing, the Children&#8217;s Museum in the &#8220;basement&#8221;, and an OmnIMAX theatre. Okay, &#8220;exhibits&#8221; is the wrong word &#8212; but museums sounds a little strange.<br />
Actually, there&#8217;s a fifth exhibit &#8212; the building itself. If you go on a weekend, you can get a free tour of Cincinnati Union Station &#8212; when it was railway station. They take you through the various sections that are still in the semi-original state. I caught a part of it when I was waiting in line for the OmnIMAX movie. More on that later.<br />
After purchasing my ticket, I went into the Cincinnati Museum. I figured that I could get through that before the movie at 4:00. The two wings used to be where vehicular traffic came through. It was a place for taxis and &#8220;motor coaches&#8221; (buses) to drop people off and pick people up. They arrived at the north wing (now the Natural History wing), drove under the main structure and picked people up on the south wing (now the Cincinnati Museum exhibit). The driveways are still visible, although now covered in grass.<br />
The first thing you notice when entering the Cincinnati Museum is a massive model of 1940s downtown Cincinnati. Some of the buildings are familiar &#8212; they still stand today. But many are gone, replaced by more modern (although not necessarily more attractive) buildings. One thing that&#8217;s very noticeable is the streetcars (taken out in the 1950s), and the railyard and warehousing district on the waterfront. Today, there are no rails down there, and the only buildings (aside from the highways) are Cinergy Field (home of the Cincinnati Reds) and a new stadium, currently under construction (the future home of the Cincinnati Reds).<br />
I spent about 15 minutes at the model, going through the interactive video, learning more about the city keeping my prisoner. It grew from the copious river traffic that flowed up and down the Ohio River. River travel was so important that the river boat captains wielded strong power over many decisions facing early Cincinnati.<br />
One of those decision was to build a bridge to neighbouring Newport, Kentucky. The captains didn&#8217;t like that idea &#8212; it would hinder their ability to monopolize freight and passenger traffic. But eventually it was built, although Cincinnati took three more years than its neighbour to grant permission. (Their excuse was potential loss of Cincinnati jobs and an increase in runaway slaves.)<br />
The bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, the same person who designed the Brooklyn Bridge. The John A. Roebling bridge, as it&#8217;s now known, is in fact the forefather of the Brooklyn Bridge. The design was later improved for its much more famous descendant.<br />
From there, I walked through a rather large exhibit about Cincinnati&#8217;s wartime efforts. They seem really proud of that. A little too proud, if you ask me. Of course, it might just be part of the Memorial Day festivities (there were vets all over the place).<br />
Then it was into ancient Cincinnati, starting from the arrival of Native Americans. One thing I learned early on was that Cincinnati, the order of officers for whom the city obtained its name, comes from Cincinnatus. Cincinnatus was a Roman general, who came from commoner stock. The officers of the Revolutionary War thought it was an appropriate name to give themselves (&#8220;Cincinnati&#8221; is Latin plural for &#8220;Cincinnatus&#8221;). So I guess in theory, a person from Cincinnati is a Cincinnatus. Hmm, I wonder&#8230;<br />
The exhibit was really quite fascinating. They covered the period of western encroachment into Ohio, from the first explorers, to the founding of Losantiville, the founding of Fort Washington, the Miami Purchase (don&#8217;t ask me what that was &#8212; the Americans seem obsessed with &#8220;purchases&#8221;, and the rising of the modern city that I can&#8217;t seem to escape.<br />
One of the neater parts of the exhibit was a 3/4 scale model of a steamboat, complete with part of original downtown Cincinnati. The exhibit stopped around the turn of the 20th century.<br />
By that time, I thought I should head up, so I wouldn&#8217;t miss the movie. I was about 40 minutes early, so I just camped out around the door. Soon, the tour of Cincinnati Union Station came by. At first, I didn&#8217;t know what it was, but I was offered to join. So I did.<br />
The first stop (for me, and also the last) was at the Amtrak station. Yes, there is an actual operating Amtrak station in this museum. Apparently, the rail travel still has to go through here. Kinda neat, eh?<br />
Once upon a time, it used to be the Men&#8217;s Waiting Room. (There was also a Women&#8217;s Waiting Room.) It featured a lounge, showers (baths for women), smoking room &#8212; everything you needed to freshen up (or wait) for your train. Today, the women&#8217;s room is gone &#8212; it&#8217;s now storage, the showers have been taken out and the door removed, and the decor is plastic overlay instead of wood. But it still features the original flooring and art deco lights.<br />
When we exited the room, the line-up for the movie had grown considerably. I opted to not follow the rest, as I wanted a good seat (this is crucial in an IMAX film).<br />
The movie was &#8220;Amazon&#8221;, and is perhaps one of the better IMAX movies I&#8217;ve seen. It tells the story of how two completely different civilizations (Western, and of the many that live in and around the Amazon basin) look to the Amazon with the same purpose in mind &#8212; saving lives. It didn&#8217;t preach heavily, but it didn&#8217;t really have to &#8212; the need to preserve the Amazon was quite clear. It was the first IMAX movie I&#8217;ve seen that made me queasy. Of course, that might have been due to lack of food.<br />
After lunch, I caved in a bought a disposable camera. I wanted a pictures of the building &#8212; it&#8217;s too nice not to take pictures. Besides, I want to scan them and put them up for all to see.<br />
Afterwards, I went through the Natural History wing. Not nearly as interesting as the Cincinnati Museum, but then again, I knew most of this. They had a few things that I didn&#8217;t expect to see &#8212; a mock-up of a cave (similar to Mammoth Cave, about three hours from here), and a mock-up of a glacier (which according to the museum, stopped just short of here during the last ice age).<br />
The animals that lived here during that time were fascinating. I had never seen a skeleton, let alone a recreation, of a giant beaver. About three times the size of a normal beaver, this beastie could probably have taken down entire trees with a single bite. Big, sharp, pointy teeth.<br />
I left around 5:45, heading back towards downtown. This time I went down Ezzard Charles Drive to Central Parkway, before heading south. I went all the way down to 3rd Street, where I walked over to the John A. Roebling bridge. (One of the weird conditions about building the bridge was that it was not allowed to be in line with any existing Cincinnati streets).<br />
I walked towards the bridge until I got to a staircase that allowed me to get down to the Ohio River. From there, I got a good enough angle to take pictures of the bridge. I returned to the bridge to take a picture from its deck.<br />
Returning to Fountain Square, I partook in a late dinner at the Rock Bottom Brewery again. I was relieved to finally get off my feet &#8212; I&#8217;d been walking for hours, and was quite tired at that point.<br />
Then it was back to my room, and back to work. But at least I got part of a day off.</p>

		<p>Ugh.<br />
It never fails. I get a long weekend, I get lousy weather. I had hoped to go to the Cincinnati Museum today, but the weather kept me indoors. Okay, that sounds like a really stupid statement &#8212; if I&#8217;m going to a museum, why would I care what the weather&#8217;s like?<br />
I want to walk there &#8212; I&#8217;m a little tired of taxis, and I could use the exercise. But it rained for most of the day. It didn&#8217;t clear up until later in the afternoon. A good thing, since I wanted to go out for dinner tonight.<br />
I spent the day working, fixing our client&#8217;s website. I watched movies and coded. I&#8217;m amazed at how much work I got done watching &#8220;Meet Joe Black&#8221;. You really can work for huge periods of time and not miss much in that movie. On the opposite view, I didn&#8217;t get much done during &#8220;The Highlander&#8221;.<br />
Importantly, though, I had breakthroughs. I only wish I were actually in the office to put my theories to the test. But I have to wait until Tuesday. Our client doesn&#8217;t like having strangers run amok in the offices unescorted.<br />
My first meal in Cincinnati that wasn&#8217;t a sub was at the Rock Bottom Brewery, a brew pub in Fountain Square, pretty much right across the street from the Westin. I don&#8217;t much like going to places like that on my own, but I didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice. Besides, Nancy (my project manager) more or less ordered me to get out for dinner at least one night this weekend.<br />
Tomorrow &#8212; more rain. Hence, more work. But Monday&#8217;s supposed to be nice. If I get enough done, I&#8217;ll make an effort to get out and see what I can find. Besides, I&#8217;ll need the air by that point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another day, another hotel. Owing to some strange reason, there seem to be a lot of people coming to Cincinnati. Can&#8217;t really figure out why.<br />
The Omni was completely booked for today when my room was booked on Tuesday. So I moved the next block over to the Westin. Larger room, better bed. Lousier TV selection, though. Oh well, I guess there are trade offs&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m definitely here for the long run. Probably won&#8217;t be escaping this place until Wednesday at the earliest. We&#8217;ve got problems that really have no explanation. Rather annoying, if you ask me. Today was about as effective as Wednesday and Thursday. This weekend is all mine, though. I&#8217;m going to rebuild parts of the site that the contractors did a number on. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t blame them &#8212; completely, anyway &#8212; they did what they had to do. Unfortunately, they aren&#8217;t the best coders in the world when it comes to HTML.<br />
My task this weekend is to correct all the mistakes. Not just theirs, but ours. We (Critical Mass) sent a few files that had a few discrepancies in style. Not a good thing. So I&#8217;m going to spend a lot of time going through every file in the site. There&#8217;s a few, but luckily, not a lot. If I had to do this for, say, the Mercedes Benz site, I&#8217;d be spending the better part of a month doing that.<br />
After work, I took the time to wander through part of downtown Cincinnati. It&#8217;s an interesting city, if only for its idiosyncracities. Its architecture is &#8230; well &#8230; interesting. (Seeing as the city&#8217;s &#8220;interesting&#8221;, I guess that goes hand-in-hand.) The buildings in downtown Cincinnati have more variance in styles than any city I&#8217;ve lived in. This is probably because Cincinnati&#8217;s been around a while, and gone through a lot of changes.<br />
The town of Losantisville was founded in 1788 on the shores of the Ohio River. Two years later, Northwest Territory Commander General Arthur St. Clair renamed the town Cincinnati, in honour of the Society of Cincinnati, an officers&#8217; organization from the Revolutionary War.<br />
Cincinnati&#8217;s location is the nexus of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. This made it a central location for commerce, which naturally attracted people. The mid-1800s saw Cincinnati&#8217;s population grow by 40 percent as a flood newcomers, mostly German immigrants. Steamboat trade and the explosion of the pork-packing industry led to Cincinnati&#8217;s role as the &#8220;Queen City of the West&#8221;. For a time, it was the nation&#8217;s sixth largest city and third-largest manufacturing centre.<br />
Today, the industry that built Cincinnati is gone. In its place are Fortune 500 companies and a lot of smaller companies. The massive factories are gone, or subdivided by smaller companies. The downtown core is completely commercial, which explains its death in the evenings (and my boredom).<br />
Because of Cincinnati&#8217;s past, it has a very interesting present &#8230; at least from an architectural perspective. Most of the buildings downtown are either modern (built within the past 20 years), or from the 1920s to 1940s. There are a few edifices from the 50s, 60s, and 70s &#8212; they&#8217;re not too hard to spot. (Although the Federal Reserve, built in 1972, is quite nice.) Old buildings are well preserved, and easy to find.<br />
Not easy to find are Cincinnati&#8217;s mistakes, and they&#8217;ve made a couple biggies. One of the more interesting ones is Cincinnati&#8217;s attempt at a subway system. The City made the attempt, starting in the 1920s using leftovers from a canal system. A large portion of the system was completed before the Depression brought the project to a screeching halt. Lack of funds and a general trend towards automobile traffic eventually led the subway into abandonment. The tunnels are used for storage, the half-built stations boarded up. Today, hardly anything exists.<br />
Tomorrow, I intend to check out the Cincinnati Museum, an old art deco railway station converted into a museum. But that&#8217;s just part of the day &#8212; the rest will be work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m trapped. Metaphorically speaking, that is.<br />
Today, I effectively did nothing. I spent the day trying to solve problems, but not really accomplishing anything. I started off with a conference call with Critical Mass and a few representatives of our client. We were reviewing the situation I&#8217;ve been dealing with since I arrived.<br />
The meeting wasn&#8217;t too long, and afterwards I felt that those involved had a clearer picture of the situation. This was important from my perspective, since I wasn&#8217;t too sure whether my superiors were wholly confident on sending me down in the first place. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m not trying to blow smoke. But considering my lack of progress, I had to make sure that the others understood that I know what I&#8217;m doing &#8230; sort of.<br />
My major problem is that there&#8217;s nothing I can do directly &#8212; I have to ask others to do it. And if those others aren&#8217;t interested in helping me, well, then I look like a bit of a putz. Not much I can do about it, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
I struggled through the day, doing what I can, until conference call #2 in the afternoon. Same client, different project. This is the one I started on my second day at Critical Mass. It just so happened that I happened to be in Cincinnati when they needed someone. Convenient, non?<br />
Tomorrow&#8217;s the start of the long weekend here. It basically means that not much work will be done. And considering the past two days of relative inactivity, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m making it out on Sunday. Not unless all the problems disappear tomorrow, and there&#8217;s a chance I can get in on the weekend. I know snowballs that have better chances than that&#8230;<br />
After work here is dull without something to do. I&#8217;ve spent the past couple of hours watching TV. Luckily for me, I get TBS &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen Enter The Dragon all the way through. First time for everything, I guess. After this is Rumble In The Bronx with Jackie Chan. I suppose Cincinnati isn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
If you can stay in your hotel room all the time, that is.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My alarm went off early this morning. I rose somewhat slowly (I hadn&#8217;t quite adjusted to the time zone), but eventually found my way into the shower. That woke me up enough to get dressed, shave, and prepare my notes for this morning.<br />
First stop was breakfast. Continental was served in the spacious (and opulent) dining area on the lobby floor. I found out shortly thereafter that I&#8217;d be far better off not eating &#8212; at nearly $18, I was quite relieved to know that I could expense it.<br />
I returned quickly to my room to call Corey, my contact at the client site. Corey works for the backend consultant, and would be one of the people I would be working with. I dug out his number and dialled his mobile phone. He asked that I call back &#8212; he was apparently still in transit. On the second call, he gave me directions to the building where I&#8217;d be wreaking havoc trying to fix a broken system.<br />
I&#8217;m working in a small team, all of whom have been slaving away on the installation since February. I feel sorry for them &#8212; given the amount of frustration I felt today alone, I can understand why they don&#8217;t smile a lot.<br />
It took most of the day before I began to understand what was going on. It wasn&#8217;t anything that we (Critical Mass) had done with our code. Nor was it anything that the consultants had done. It was, or at least seemed to be, the server. The software we needed didn&#8217;t appear to be correct. Simple HTML codes were being garbled.<br />
So, problem solved and I get to go home, right? Not quite. There&#8217;s a lot of things that are still unresolved &#8212; most notably the issue of whether or not the server is actually the problem. We don&#8217;t know. I came to that conclusion based on results we were getting from the server and my knowledge of how these things (usually) work. The consultants liked my answer, mostly because they were having so many problems, my hypothesis would explain a large part of it. However, I have yet to put it through the scientific process.<br />
After work, I trudged my way back to the hotel. It was hot. It was humid. I&#8217;d forgotten what it was like &#8212; I&#8217;ve been gone from the East for so long, the sudden rise in temperature (and subsequent decrease in comfort) was a little surprising.<br />
What wasn&#8217;t surprising was the city. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but Cincinnati feels and smells like &#8230; well, an American city. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s the same acrid diesel-infused stench (thankfully not strong) of an industrial city. Which is odd, since Cincinnati isn&#8217;t quite as industrial as it used to be.<br />
Returning to my room, I quickly changed into shorts, and proceeded to figure out what I would do. The answer was quick (and somewhat obvious, at least to those who know me) &#8212; a movie. Specifically, Mission: Impossible 2. (Critical Mass *had* to send me in opening week&#8230;) The hard part was finding a place that actually had the movie.<br />
There are no movie theatres in downtown Cincinnati. I don&#8217;t know why. Makes no sense. The nearest theatre is five miles away &#8230; straight-line distance. It&#8217;s about 10 miles, once you count in all the turns and zigzags. It costs about US$14. So why did I bother? Well, simply put, there ain&#8217;t a heck of a lot to do in downtown Cincinnati.<br />
The taxi driver had no idea where the Showcase Cinema was. I only knew that it was off of Route 562. The driver took off in that direction, while I attempted to narrow down the search. The major problem was that we had no real address, and for the second time since I got here, my cell phone didn&#8217;t want to dial. (A note for you Clearnet users &#8212; it has problems roaming in the States.)<br />
We headed up I-71, looking for the turn-off onto Route 562. The driver&#8217;s instinct took over and he left the highway shortly after turning onto Route 562, into a subdivision. We pulled into a BP station, where he quickly got directions. A scarce five minutes later, we arrived at the Showcase Cinemas.<br />
It was worth it, at least in my opinion. Certainly better than watching TV in my suite all night. And yes, the taxi was expensive, but since I ate about US$5 of food today, and will probably do same tomorrow, it&#8217;ll all eventually balance out.<br />
I hope&#8230;</p>
