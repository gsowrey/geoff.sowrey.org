	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long day.<br />
It all started about a week ago. One of our clients, whom I&#8217;m afraid I cannot mention, had a problem with the website we developed for them. Actually, it wasn&#8217;t the client so much as it was our so-called partner in crime.<br />
Critical Mass typically designs the front-end &#8212; all the pretty pictures and clicky things &#8212; of a website. Typically, someone else does the back-end &#8212; all the junk that deals with the ecommerce and database. This isn&#8217;t our idea &#8212; it&#8217;s usually the client&#8217;s. We don&#8217;t much cotton to that process; it lends to more problems than it&#8217;s worth. That&#8217;s how I ended up here in Cincinnati.<br />
We provided one of our stunning works of art to the client, who then turned it over to the backend developers (whom, again, I cannot mention). The firm is large, and we assumed technically savvy. We should know better.<br />
They fubared the site. Lemme back up &#8212; they tried to merge our site with their backend, and then claimed that our &#8220;monkey s&#8211;t JavaScript&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a load of bally-hoo &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t have shipped it if it didn&#8217;t work. Then we got the email that drove most of us in Web Development off the deep end&#8230;<br />
We develop our sites with the most recent developments in HTML, including JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). One of our favourite tricks is to build everything in &#8220;layers&#8221; &#8212; small pieces we can stack on top of each other. It makes the site very flexible. This technique is what was causing the backend consultants grief.<br />
The backend (using a system called Dynamo) wasn&#8217;t working with our layers (specifically, a tag called a &#8220;DIV&#8221;). So they decided that we could no longer develop using DIV tags, and had to build everything with tables. Uhhhhh, no.<br />
We thought this was a load of crock from the moment we first heard it. We knew that our code was solid &#8212; we&#8217;d built several sites using Dynamo and DIVs, and never had a problem. So we told them that. They didn&#8217;t exactly listen. I wrote up a small quasi-manifesto (with some contributions from Adile, my partner in crime in my first project at Critical Mass). I figure that&#8217;s how I ended up here.<br />
On Friday, just after lunch, Nancy (the account manager for this particular client) drew me aside and asked if I would go to Cincinnati and clear this mess up. Big responsibility. No, I wasn&#8217;t the best choice &#8212; there are others in the company who were far better suited to this problem &#8212; but I was the best choice of the available people.<br />
Simply put, there were about five people Nancy would have sent. Two were far too tied up on projects to pull off. One was, well, we were worried that they would back down and give into the consultant&#8217;s demands to convert the entire site to tables. Another would have been ideal, but would probably get into too many arguments to be truly effective. That left me. Being between projects, and having some experience with Dynamo and DIVs, I got fingered to go.<br />
This morning, I was running around like a madman, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible. The flight still hadn&#8217;t been booked (nor the hotel), I hadn&#8217;t packed (owing to a lack of a suitably-sized duffel bag), I needed to set up email forwarding, get files copied to the laptop (which had only just returned from Cincinnati), I had to square away rent (just in case I don&#8217;t get back before the beginning of the month), and I had to pay a couple of bills. All that before 11:00.<br />
I left at 11:40 for the airport. The flight was at 2:05 on Northwest Airlines. I would fly from Calgary to Minneapolis/St. Paul, where I&#8217;d catch a connecting flight to Cincinnati. (Oh the joys of the airline hub.) I arrived at Calgary airport in sufficient time to check-in and get lunch.<br />
I&#8217;ve never flown Northwest before. I don&#8217;t like American airlines in general, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having to take one. But when given no choice, you take what you&#8217;re given. That&#8217;s why when I found out that my ticket automatically upgraded me to First Class, I didn&#8217;t refuse.<br />
I didn&#8217;t check any bags &#8212; I prefer not to, just so I don&#8217;t have to deal with baggage pick-up at the other end. Customs was fun. The game was &#8220;Let&#8217;s See If We Can Freak Geoff Out&#8221;. The questions came fast and hard, and I responded just as quickly. Then I goofed. When asked for the duration of my stay, I said I hoped to return on Sunday. &#8220;Hoped.&#8221; Bad choice of word. This brought up a whole issue of why I wouldn&#8217;t be coming back on Sunday. That escalated into the purpose of my visit, and what exactly was I doing there. I figured it would snowball into &#8220;Why can&#8217;t an American do this?&#8221; &#8212; luckily, it didn&#8217;t.<br />
The flight was late, by about 30 minutes or so. Soon we were called, and I walked down the gangway to our DC-9. I can&#8217;t tell you the last time I&#8217;d flown in a DC-9, only that it&#8217;s been a very long time. I had 3C, and the adjoining 3A, all to myself. Wow. Big seats. Nice service. Free booze. Too bad I&#8217;m trying not to drink (I get dehydrated enough as it is on planes without having alcohol).<br />
It was about three hours to Minneapolis. During the time, we were served lunch &#8212; a chicken sandwich. But in First Class, the sandwich is nice and hot, with yummy cheese and grilled peppers. It comes with a nice little salad, and an Italian rolled ice cream ball.<br />
I like First Class.<br />
You also get a GLASS glass for your drink, instead of some goofy plastic cup. It really does make a difference.<br />
We arrived in Minneapolis around 5:45pm (local time). I was supposed to go to Gate 7, where I&#8217;d catch my connecting flight at 7:00. So of course, we came in at Gate 64. Figures. I hiked across the airport (and boy, is it a big airport), and found my way to Gate 7. There, I plunked myself down, and continued to teach myself Dynamo. (Not having a manual makes it kinda hard.)<br />
Around 6:30, I began to wonder why Gate 7 didn&#8217;t have any sign up for my flight. Gate 8, which was leaving for Green Bay at 7:15, had its sign up before I got there. I started to wonder. So I asked.<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Yeah, your flight is leaving from Gate Sev&#8230; er, they&#8217;ve moved it.&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;Where to?&#8221; (I already knew the answer. Murphy was standing right behind me.)<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Gate 82.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8212; I&#8217;m glad that I started working out (although I&#8217;ve been a little lax in the past week or two). By the time I got to Gate 82, I was winded. Of course, I was hiking at a serious pace to get there on time.<br />
Flight 8530 was being operated by Mesaba Airlines. I haven&#8217;t heard of &#8217;em, either. Frankly, that worried me, too. But as it turns out, they just operate Northwest&#8217;s regional flights. Supposedly, Cincinnati is regional from Minneapolis.<br />
We flew an RJ-45, er, 85 (sorry, techie joke there). I&#8217;ve never heard of an RJ-85, I don&#8217;t even know who built the silly thing. It looks kind of like a cross between a Harrier Jumpjet and a 747. Very strange. Holds about 69 people. Flies like a kite &#8212; sways all over the bloody place.<br />
The meal was another sandwich &#8212; turkey, this time. No ice cream, though. We got a gourmet cookie instead. Whee. This time I had a rowmate, a guy from Cisco Systems. We engaged in hearty conversation in the last 20 minutes or so of the flight, recounting our views of Digital Equipment, and how we realized that they were doomed long before Compaq bought &#8217;em out.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten how humid it gets out here (in the East, that is). Calgary is dry &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking through a lake out here (comparatively speaking, of course). I sweltered the entire way downtown to the Omni Netherlands.<br />
Nathan, who&#8217;d only recently returned to Calgary from here, complained that the Omni&#8217;s rooms were &#8220;small&#8221;. I could easily hold a small concert in my room. I hate to know what he thinks &#8220;big&#8221; is.<br />
Well, I&#8217;m off to bed now. I&#8217;ve got a long day tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. It&#8217;s going to be a long week&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend saw the first league tournament of the season. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out why we had a tournament so early in the year (we&#8217;ve had TWO regular season games so far, both on the same day). But I wasn&#8217;t about to turn down the ability to go out and get some more practice.<br />
Goodness knows I need it.<br />
Our first game was Friday evening up in the Northeast at Lester B. Pearson High School (a bare hop-skip-and-jump from my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s), against a team called the Screwballs. Oddly enough, of the three games we played this weekend, theirs is the only one whose name I remember.<br />
We almost had to forfeit due to lack of players. It wasn&#8217;t a problem of not enough women, we didn&#8217;t have enough guys. Luckily, the rest showed up just as we started the game. It was a chilly evening, so I was quite happy to play right field, where I would be at least somewhat mobile.<br />
The first inning went more-or-less uneventful &#8212; no major screwups on our part, no major offensive on their part. The second inning brought my first at bat. Memories of our first two games hung heavily with me. I was dreading another strike out. I hadn&#8217;t had the chance to get to a batting cage (and so I&#8217;ve found out since then, they ain&#8217;t cheap, so I&#8217;ll be going sparingly when I actually get around to going). I was, shall we say, apprehensive.<br />
Looking at the selection of bats, I noticed that there was a new bat. I&#8217;d tried all the previous three bats, all without success. I figured that I couldn&#8217;t possibly do any worse with the new bat.<br />
The first pitch looked good. Figuring that I was going to miss it anyway, I swung. A peculiar feeling vibrated through the bat handle a fraction of a moment later, and I found myself wondering what just happened. I looked up to see a small off-white sphere sailing away from where the bat had just been. The now-familiar &#8220;plack!&#8221; sound the ball usually made when it landed on the mat was not to be heard. Using my powerful deductive reasoning, I came to the (rather surprising) conclusion that I&#8217;d actually hit the ball.<br />
Who &#8216;da thunk it?<br />
That&#8217;s when I heard the voices. &#8220;Run!&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t my team yelling at me &#8212; it was the ones in my head. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone insane. I&#8217;ll explain in a moment.) I bolted to first as fast as my legs, which clearly weren&#8217;t ready for the sudden motion, could take me. There was no way I was going to make it to second, so I held tight.<br />
Needless to say, I was rather amazed with myself. Not so much that it was a good hit (it passed over the shortstop&#8217;s outstretched (with a good jump) glove by mere inches), but that I hit it at all. Little did I know what was happening to me.<br />
(I would hit every single time at bat for the rest of the weekend &#8212; only once would I not make it to base. Every time, it was with that bat &#8212; a Louisville Slugger. I love that bat.)<br />
The inning ended, sadly, with me stranded on second. Well, I was on my way to third, but the batter was caught out.<br />
Returning to right field, I began to sit back into waiting. Right field, especially in this league, is quiet. Not much happens out there. (Now that I&#8217;ve said that, I&#8217;ll be inundated with pop flies for the rest of the season.)<br />
The first batter up collided with the ball sort of like a Howitzer &#8230; into right field. (He was a lefty, it was half-expected.) Last year, I missed a lot of these shots. For some reason, I was always too short. (Short as in I wasn&#8217;t far enough out in the field.) I could see the ball arcing towards me, and all I kept thinking was: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna miss this.&#8221;<br />
Then I heard the voices.<br />
&#8220;Take a couple steps back.&#8221;<br />
So I did. Suddenly, I realized that I was under it. I adjusted my footing so that I was right under it. Next thing I knew, the ball was in my glove. I paused a brief moment until the shock wore off. I threw the ball to the second baser, but there was no rush &#8212; there were no other runners.<br />
While I waited for the next batter, I stood there trying to figure out what the heck had just happened. I was puzzled beyond belief.<br />
You see, I&#8217;d heard the voices before. On last Monday&#8217;s games, I kept hearing things like &#8220;Run&#8221;, &#8220;Hold up&#8221;, &#8220;Bend and scoop&#8221;, and &#8220;Stab at the ball&#8221;. Yet no-one on my team was telling me these things.<br />
At first, I thought it was just me. But standing out there in right field, one gets a fair bit of time to think, reflect, self search, and wonder. In that inning, I had an epiphany. Like being broad-sided with a battleship, I abruptly realized what was happening. I didn&#8217;t have (and still don&#8217;t have) a mentor on the team. But I don&#8217;t need one &#8212; I&#8217;ve got my mentors from last year. Every word of advice they ever told me is coming back.<br />
It&#8217;s sort of like when you make a stew or chili. If you try and eat it right away, it&#8217;s okay, but not great. You have to let it sit and let all the flavours blend. During the six-plus months off, all the advice I got starting sinking in. Like someone turning a light on in a dark room, I knew where the voices were coming from.<br />
As you can guess, I was quite happy to figure this out &#8230; I was beginning to worry for a while.<br />
Now this hasn&#8217;t turned me into Sammy Sosa &#8212; but I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m playing significantly better than last year. Either that, or the team (and the league) is significantly worse than last year&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Despite my apparent improvement, we were unable to defeat our opposing team. However, we lost by only a couple of runs. This, believe it or not, is a very positive thing. It showed that despite only one practice (which I missed) and two games (one of which we one), we weren&#8217;t doing too badly.<br />
That didn&#8217;t stop us from engaging in another practice. Those of us who weren&#8217;t in a rush to take off stuck around for an impromptu ball-catching session. The voices kept telling me what to do (&#8220;Dive&#8221;, &#8220;Step Back&#8221;, &#8220;Run In&#8221;, &#8220;LOOK OUT!!&#8221;), and I kept catching the balls. It was almost like someone had me on remote control. It was actually kinda creepy.<br />
My alarm went off at 6:00 the following morning. I ignored it until the second alarm went off at 6:30. Because we&#8217;d lost the previous night, our first game was at 8:00 at the Deerfoot Athletic Park at Deerfoot and 16th Ave NW.<br />
One look out the window told me what it wasn&#8217;t going to be a warm day. It looked cold. There was no reason for me to think that, but it looked cold. Sure enough, a check of the thermometer (on TV) told me that it was cold &#8212; it was definitely a morning for sweats.<br />
I arrived at the field not long after Ken, our coach. We found our field, and started to wait for the rest of the team. They slowly started accumulating after a little while, the rest of us shivering in the cold. When the equipment finally arrived, several of us immediately began warming up.<br />
The sun poked into the field about 20 minutes after we started, and as the right fielder, I was in a prime position to take its full warmth. Even then, I was still cold. It wasn&#8217;t until after a couple of innings that I was warm enough to even unzip the collar on my sweatshirt.<br />
The game was tough and tight &#8212; we were about evenly matched. Except that we were one player short. We need 10 people on a team (the tenth person is a &#8220;rover&#8221;, someone who can run throughout the outfield, supporting the other fielders). We had only nine. This meant we had to take an automatic out every rotation of the batting order. It was a shortage that would cost us dearly.<br />
Tight as the game was, we came up two runs short. And no, the final score wasn&#8217;t 2-0. It was 10-8. That&#8217;s how well we played. Hearing voices in my head was becoming a handy thing to have.<br />
Our next game wasn&#8217;t until 12:30, so I opted to head downtown and do some work. Not real work, of course, but something for fun. I&#8217;m developing a website for a good friend of mine, who has a very cool product. It gets launched next Monday &#8212; maybe I&#8217;ll let you know! I was a little behind on my work on that, so I figured I&#8217;d make use of the downtime and start plugging away.<br />
As I wrote HTML and tweaked images, I could see the bright sunshine outside. I figured our next game would be nice, and I could finally strip down to my shorts. I should know better than that&#8230;<br />
When I got back to Deerfoot Athletic Park, the sky was cloudy, the wind blowing harder, and it seemed even colder than in the morning. I was the first to arrive, and I watched as two teams battled for the chance to play again later in the day.<br />
Our team assembled, even with a couple of spares for a change, and prepared to take the field. I took right field, as usual, and started freezing to death. It wasn&#8217;t much above zero (as was fully shown when it snowed in the fourth inning).<br />
In fact, it was so cold the voices shivered. Luckily, I was still able to play reasonably well. But even if we had all played in top-notch form, we could not have held back the onslaught. We were outmatched, and it wasn&#8217;t by a small margin. Final score: 22-8.<br />
Losing by that much when you play poorly isn&#8217;t such a bad loss &#8212; you kind of expect it. Losing by that much when you put everything you have into the game is just downright demoralizing.<br />
Tonight, we&#8217;re back at the game for another doubleheader. (All our play dates this year are doubleheaders, for some stupid reason.) My shin is still a little stiff from Saturday, but with luck I&#8217;ll be able to play.<br />
Just so long as I have the voices to keep me company in right field.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;The goats are being sucked.&#8221;<br />
Many of you will stare at the screen and wonder what the heck that means. Others of you will nod in recognition. For the benefit of those who have no idea what that quote means, &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221; was the Rad Sox&#8217; battle cry last year just before taking to the field.<br />
Yesterday was my new team&#8217;s first foray onto the diamond. I play with one of two company softball teams. There were 40 people who turned out this year, so we made up two separate teams. One, called the Cooters (got me on the meaning of this one), and the one I play for &#8212; the Base HREFs. Never let HTML developers try to come up with punny names. They can&#8217;t.<br />
I was a late joiner. During my interview at Critical Mass back in early March, I saw a sign-up sheet for the softball team. Thinking that this would be a good way to get me out, I made myself remember the sign was there for when I was hired. (Yes, I was optimistic.) Sure enough, I got myself onto the team within a few days of starting here.<br />
Because I was a late joiner, and because there were already 20 people on each team, I was accidentally missed from the first batch of email, one of which listed the first (and so far only) practice. That said, I made it out to last night&#8217;s games (we had a double-header), complete with a jersey (left over from last year).<br />
This year is going to be difficult. I know only a couple of people on the team. Our captain, Ken, knows the rules, but he&#8217;s not a tenth as cool (nor does he possess the attitude) as Lee, the Rad Sox&#8217; &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221;. There&#8217;s no star player jackrabbitting around the outfield. And I have no mentor this year to correct my plethora of bad habits &#8212; the gap Neall filled is quite large, as was evident by last night&#8217;s games.<br />
The first game was against ourselves, or rather, the other CMass team. This was going to make for interesting water cooler conversation and stairwell banter &#8212; to the loser would go the ignominy of defeat, to the winner the right to brag for the rest of the year. So needless to say, we all played horribly.<br />
There were shining points &#8212; both teams had their rallies while the outfield scrambled madly to catch fly balls, and the infield shut down runners with Terminator-like efficiency. There were also the downpoints &#8230; like my batting. I didn&#8217;t hit a darn thing all night. Nada. Sqwat. In fact, I *think* I *might* have actually disturbed the ball&#8217;s wake once. Struck out every time I went up. At least last year I tended to hit the ball more often than not.<br />
I need to spend an afternoon in a batting cage&#8230;<br />
I will say one thing about the fields in Calgary &#8212; like the Prairies, they&#8217;re flat. It&#8217;s great. No worries about a fast rolling ball suddenly flying up into your schnoz. I&#8217;m not really looking forward to reliving last year&#8217;s little injury.<br />
The game lasted only seven innings &#8212; we had a double-header, and the sun sets just after 9:00, leaving only about three hours of play. Both teams played hard, and for a while, I thought we were losing (rather badly) to the other team. But in the bottom of the seventh (we were up at bat), I was surprised to find out that we were only three runs down. Then it was two &#8230; one &#8230; and then tied. We ended the game with a final run.<br />
Then the dispute began. The Cooters believed that we had miscounted, believing they were six runs ahead. Name calling and insults &#8212; the usual interoffice banter &#8212; erupted around the diamond while the score keepers sorted the mess out. Despite the loud by-the-books manager of the Cooters (who I&#8217;m told is the CEO&#8217;s brother), they missed an entire inning of runs. We hailed victorious.<br />
Somehow, I&#8217;ve got the feeling that&#8217;s the only win we&#8217;ll see this season.<br />
The second game was &#8230; well, I was going to put in a neat little literary description to give you an idea of how badly we lost. The only problem is I can&#8217;t think of one good enough to convey such an utter defeat. The only thing that comes close is Napoleon&#8217;s naval defeat in Aboukir Bay by Admiral Horatio Nelson in 1798. Nelson claimed &#8220;there is no word to describe such an utter victory&#8221;. It was the most decisive battle in naval history.<br />
No, I didn&#8217;t just pluck that little fact out of my head &#8212; living on my own, I&#8217;ve had a bit of time to watch TV, and I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of The Learning Channel lately. They had a show on Napoleon&#8217;s Obsession with Egypt &#8212; quite a fascinating show. I can certainly understand why Napoleon was so revered. (Perhaps more interesting was another TLC show that told the story of Napoleon&#8217;s murder many years later on the island of St. Helena.)<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a geek with lots of useless trivia. Let&#8217;s just say that I&#8217;ve never needed to use a lifeline on &#8220;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&#8221;. Not that I watch the show with any regularity at all. In fact, I think I&#8217;ve seen parts of about seven episodes. I usually turn the channel because I end up screaming at the guy who can&#8217;t remember if Humpty Dumpty fell of a wall or a horse.<br />
I played right field during both games. In the first game, I was bored. The Cooters are all right-handed batters. But The Screwballs (the second time) not only had left-handed batters, but had people who could place hits. I was running all over the place. That&#8217;s how I got injured.<br />
Relax, no blood loss. I was sprinting after a shot (that I should have caught), but as usual I was too shallow. Realizing this, I quickly pivoted to lunge and catch it. Only problem was that while my body was turning, my right leg decided to mutiny. I somehow ended up wrenching my quadricep. I barely made it through the inning, and ended up sitting out the rest of the game.<br />
Today, I&#8217;m sore. That&#8217;s to be expected, I guess. I haven&#8217;t played in about nine months. But I&#8217;m not as bad as I thought I would be. I&#8217;m going to the batting cages &#8212; I&#8217;m in dire need of practice. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll do better in this weekend&#8217;s tournament.<br />
You can all stop laughing now.</p>

		<p>If it were possible to work like a dog, my name would be Rover.<br />
Bow wow.<br />
I&#8217;m working on the latest and greatest version of a website we&#8217;re doing for one of our Fortune 500 clients. There are nine people on the team: Three designers, two project managers, a production person, one and a half programmers, and one web developer &#8212; that is, me. Our project was due tomorrow. Despite the approximate 200 hours I&#8217;ve put in during the past two weeks (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), that&#8217;s just not happening. There&#8217;s still so much to do.<br />
So yes, I&#8217;ve been busy. For quite a while. Been working my tail off. (Yeah, there&#8217;s that dog reference you&#8217;ve been waiting for me to spring on you.)<br />
I&#8217;ve pulled a few near-all nighters. I usually end up pulling &#8217;em with Dave, one of my colleagues, and the guy who hired me. We get really goofy around 2am or so. Usually we&#8217;re loaded up on Coke or Pepsi and adrenaline (from playing Unreal Tournament). You&#8217;d be amazed how much I can actually get done when it&#8217;s just Dave and I plugging away at our seemingly endless list of problems.<br />
So Friday rolls around. I&#8217;m planning on being here during the weekend, to finish more work. (I&#8217;ve got lots of it &#8212; enough to last at least another week.) Nancy (my project manager) calls me to discuss a few things. I let her know I&#8217;ll tackle them during the weekend. The conversation goes like this:<br />
Me: Yeah, I&#8217;ll fix it over the weekend.<br />
Nancy: No, you won&#8217;t. Look, Geoff, take the weekend off.<br />
Me: Can&#8217;t, too much work to be done by Tuesday. [Tuesday&#8217;s our deadline.]<br />
Nancy: Geoff, go home for the weekend. Don&#8217;t make me make you&#8230;<br />
She called back at about 5:30 that evening. Dave and I were engaged in a serious game of blowing each other up with high explosives. The phone call went like this:<br />
Nancy: (Sternly) You&#8217;re still here.<br />
Me: Uh, yeah? I usually am&#8230; (oooh, you little weasel, I&#8217;ll get you for that!!)<br />
Nancy: Go home, Geoff. Now.<br />
Me: I&#8217;m not doing work!! Honest! (HA! Take that, Dave!!)<br />
Nancy: Then what are you doing?<br />
Me: Playing video games with Dave. (You missed!! You missed!! CRAP! You didn&#8217;t miss!)<br />
Nancy: Oh, well, that&#8217;s fine. Just don&#8217;t do anything productive, okay?<br />
I got a cool project manager.<br />
Not working this weekend wasn&#8217;t easy. I had the urge to come back and fix things. Yes, I&#8217;m dedicated to the project. I want to see it work well. Call me weird&#8230;<br />
So Friday night, Chris and I met a friend (and co-worker), Sylvie, at Eau Claire Theatres to catch the Friday premiere of the most anticipated movie of the month. No, not &#8220;The Cell&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Godzilla 2000&#8221;, of course! There&#8217;s nothing like watching some guy in a massive rubber suit trash models of Tokyo. Especially when it&#8217;s presented on the big screen! (We saw &#8220;The Cell&#8221; the following night with Dave.)<br />
It was a weird night. As we left the theatre, I suggested to Chris that we pop into Pongo, a trendy little neo-Asian restaurant on 17th Ave. As we walked down 4th St. towards Pongo, we encountered two young ladies who were (assumedly) on their way to the Palace. They required some assistance.<br />
The first question, which I missed, was &#8220;Hey, do you guys have sisters??&#8221;<br />
Chris answered the question correctly. The answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;. They assumed (rather poorly, at least in my case) that our sisters would have asked our opinions as to their appearance before going out clubbing. Cathy has never asked me such a question (she&#8217;s smart enough to know I&#8217;m utterly clueless about most of these things). These two poor girls, however, were too drunk to notice that I&#8217;m clueless.<br />
Okay, maybe not the blonde. She knew enough to ask only Chris.<br />
Anyway, they literally wanted us to check them out. They invited us. Only in Calgary, I tell you &#8230; only in Calgary. I&#8217;ve never in my life been invited to purposely ogle, and then offer words of encouragement. It threw both Chris and I for a bit of a loop.<br />
Our interrogators walked onto their destination (after momentarily chastising us for not going with them &#8212; I believe their exact words were &#8220;You&#8217;re going the wrong way!!&#8221;), and we headed towards ours. But the weirdness didn&#8217;t end there&#8230;<br />
As we arrived at Pongo, three jock-types leaned over and asked if we would flip two women &#8220;the bird&#8221; as we walked in. We were told that &#8220;we know those chicks&#8221;, and that it would be in good fun. Chris and I don&#8217;t play those games, especially if we&#8217;re single, they&#8217;re single, and there&#8217;s a hope in hell of *something* happening. (Hey, we might be silly, but we ain&#8217;t stupid &#8230; most of the time, anyway.)<br />
We were running out of excuses not to when one of the women piped up: &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got a beer glass, and I ain&#8217;t afraid to use it!&#8221; Chris ended our conversation with the jocks: &#8220;No offence guys, but she frightens me more than you do.&#8221;<br />
On Saturday, Chris and I wandered about Calgary, wandering mostly aimlessly. It was great. I hadn&#8217;t been out of the office for so long, I&#8217;d forgotten the sun was even out. We walked in and out of malls and shops, not looking for anything in particular (though I did buy another CD recommended by my &#8220;source&#8221; at A&amp;B Sound). While we were there, we ran into our newest friend in Calgary, Shannon. She&#8217;s a long-term A&amp;B employee looking to get out.<br />
Chris and I have become career counsellors for Shannon. She&#8217;s been offered the chance to get a job at the Calgary Sun. But she&#8217;s been out of the loop for so long, she&#8217;s not sure how to get the job. So Chris and I are working to improve her portfolio and resume. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to do something for her.<br />
Only in Calgary would someone you really only got to know that day call you up for help in getting a better job. Only in Calgary&#8230;<br />
Anyway, I&#8217;m late at the office again, having taken a chainsaw to some really nasty software bugs in the code. I had a few minutes to whip of a &#8220;hello, I&#8217;m alive&#8221; message. I hope y&#8217;all are doing well, and hopefully we&#8217;ll talk in the not-too-distant future&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It is said that the best things come to those who wait. I can safely say that I&#8217;ve got good things coming.<br />
It&#8217;s been a month since my somewhat dramatic departure from Vancouver and I entered into obscurity. It&#8217;s high time that you all found out what the heck happened since then. Some of you already know, but this is for everyone else&#8230;<br />
The destination was Calgary. Reason: I have family here (relatives &#8212; my parents and sister live in Ontario) and I have friends here. Calgary is also an ideal location for getting a job, particularly if you&#8217;re in the high-tech industry. I arrived here in late afternoon on March 1, and have been here ever since.<br />
The job hunt was important, and it began almost immediately. My first (and only) interview with a company was only two days after arriving. I continued to search through the Internet (Workopolis, Monster.Ca, and various other sites) and landed a few interviews with headhunters (ack!).<br />
Things picked up when Critical Mass (the company I interviewed with) called to check my references. Three weeks after arriving in Calgary, I landed a job. I am now a Web Developer at Critical Mass, developer to the stars &#8230; or at least American companies with a lot of money.<br />
I started on Monday. I would&#8217;ve sent this email then, but I didn&#8217;t have a computer. I didn&#8217;t get a computer until nearly noon yesterday, and then I got buried under a rush job. They don&#8217;t waste time around here trying to break newbies. It was daunting to say the least &#8212; I knew no-one, had no idea what I was doing, and was being thrown into a project I new nothing about.<br />
It was great. Really. I enjoyed it.<br />
Except for the fact that I worked until 23:15 last night. On my second day. At least my name is getting around&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m realizing that my web development skills are going to accelerate about 100 fold in the next few days as I learn all these neat tricks Critical Mass has developed over the past year or two.<br />
CM parallels Radical in many ways &#8212; lots of people (estimates are around 160), they occupy most of a building except for a quasi-architectural firm on the first floor, the average age is in the mid-to-late 20&#8217;s, and the talent here is amazing. I hope I can live up to the competition.<br />
But it&#8217;s definitely not Radical. Maybe in time I&#8217;ll think of them as being the same, but for now &#8230; well, it&#8217;s a living.<br />
I have a new apartment in downtown Calgary. It&#8217;s nice, and has a view of the north and of downtown. It&#8217;s really close to a lot of things, including work (a five minute commute on foot) &#8230; my roommate (and one of my best friends) Chris joins me in a few weeks.<br />
Hmm&#8230;<br />
You&#8217;d think that after a month, I&#8217;d have a lot to write about. I guess not. My log entries will hopefully be a tad more frequent. Oh, and as I do with each new email address I have &#8212; any of you who would prefer not to receive these (relax, they only come every couple of weeks or so), please let me know.</p>
