		<p>Leaving Alex this morning wasn&#8217;t easy. Given the events of the last couple of days, I would have preferred to stay in bed with her.<br />
But business calls, and I&#8217;m off to New York (though Newark) for business meetings with the IT department of our Mercedes client. It&#8217;s mostly an educational exchange, as we try pass on a lot of the knowledge we have to the IT group. Exactly <em>why</em> we&#8217;re doing this I&#8217;m admittedly a little unclear on, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s all for a good reason.<br />

		<p>Despite having the room to myself, I was really groggy when I got up this morning. I know it wasn&#8217;t a result of last night, though, as I didn&#8217;t feel any worse for wear. I showered, packed, and checked out (using the television interface &#8212; I don&#8217;t go to the front desk unless I have to). Running into Jamie on the way down, the two of us hiked directly over to the Tribune building. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to go to the office for email.<br />

		<p>Allard and I hit the restaurant in the main atrium for breakfast, joined shortly thereafter by Christian and a very tired-looking Jules. Powdered eggs aren&#8217;t exactly the breakfast of champions. Jules has been up late working on presentations for today. Allard and I are thankfully exempt from any actual presentations. We&#8217;re more or less along for the ride.<br />
Actually, me more than Allard. Allard, at least, is the Technical Director. He needs to be there because the client knows who he is. He needs to be there because some of MBIT will be there. Why do *I* need to be there? Well, I can&#8217;t say for sure, because I really don&#8217;t know, but I think it comes down to the Client-Side Rearchitecture project that I&#8217;m spearheading, and that Allard won&#8217;t be here tomorrow (he&#8217;s only here for a day).<br />

		<p>I hate waking up before 6:00. There&#8217;s just something fundamentally wrong with it. Today, though, it was necessary. Today, I fly to Chicago.<br />
Was ready for my 6:30 pickup. Allard was collecting me for the trip to the airport. I wasn&#8217;t sure if he was going to show up on time, since we&#8217;d had no actual solid confirmation of the pickup. At 6:25, I started formulating a backup plan, in the event that Allard was running a little late. His car appeared in front of my house at 6:30, right on the nose, saving me additional grief.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We had 2005 planning meetings this week, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. They can be quite painful, if for no reason other than for going over projects all day. It really wears on the brain, and the body. Well, my body, anyway. I have to drink Coke to focus well, since these meetings have a tendency to cause my brain to tune out. At the end of Wednesday, I was exhausted. It also didn&#8217;t help that I was having to stay late to catch up on work I was unable to do during the day.<br />
But as is typical with these annual meetings, we usually have an annual team building event. There were no green alligators or long-necked geese this year (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]), which I&#8217;m partially thankful for. (That had been a lot of fun, but I felt quite hungover the next day &#8230; not that today is going all that swimmingly, I might add.)<br />
Following the end of our work day, those of us on the Mercedes-Benz USA account high-tailed it over to Eau Claire Market and the Cinescape, an arcade/lounge attached to the Cineplex Odeon theatre. We didn&#8217;t know exactly what was in store for us, especially since Scott, Torin, and I were the first to arrive.<br />
Somehow, though, we stuck out like a giraffe in a penguin parade, and a very helpful server by the name of Nigel came to our rescue. We had two pool tables, a series of tables, and an unlimited bar tab at our disposal, with food coming along shortly thereafter.<br />
Let the party begin.<br />
By 18:00, most of those who would be attending had arrived. Although the team numbers about 60, maybe only 2/3 of them showed up. While we waited for dinner, we played pool (I got smoked by Torin and Casey, who are both pool sharks) and chatted amongst ourselves. Some of the designers played darts (which, after Luke&#8217;s going away party &#8212; see [[Luke leaves Critical Mass]] &#8212; I had decided I was going to avoid).<br />
Dinner was quite good &#8212; much better than I had expected. Salads, buns, mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and chicken or salmon (or both, if you prefered). It tasted great, even standing up. While we ate, the rules of the game were explained&#8230;<br />
Each of us were given $1,000 in Monopoly money (photocopied, mind you) and 40 game tokens. The idea was to bet each other on games and try win as much money as possible. We were divided into teams, and the team with the most money at the end won the bragging rights. (As it stands, it&#8217;s up for debate which team ultimately ended up winning, no doubt in part to the quantities of alcohol consumed.)<br />
Not being a betting man, myself (I follow the wise words of Jack Burton: When the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake, just look that big old storm right in the eye and say, &#8220;Give me your best shot. I can take it!&#8221; &#8230; no wait, wrong quote &#8230; I never bet my money, only my life). I pocketed the whole wad in my back pocket and played dumb the rest of the evening.<br />
For those of you who know me, I can play dumb real well.<br />
I finally beat Adrian in a game of air hockey. It&#8217;s taken a while. It was a hard-fought game, with both of us sending the puck in multiple directions off the table. The score came down to 7-6. It would be the last time I choose to challenge Adrian last night. (I would take Scott later on, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly who won &#8230; it was probably him.) I jumped in and out of games throughout the night, until all my tokens (including a healthy refill from Dan) were depleted. My trigger finger hurt.<br />
Talking and boasting continued until the lounge closed, and we all headed over to the Barley Mill to continue. Now, true believers, this is where things get a tad hazy, because I&#8217;m not entirely sure how long we were there for. I do remember one beer and playing a game where you try to guess what three words have in common (quite a good game, I might add). But that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t think we were there very long before we all upped and headed for Chinese.<br />
We lost two along the way, but Dan was still leading the charge. We ended up at Me and U, on the corner of 3rd Ave. and Centre Street. I&#8217;d never been there before, but it seemed like fun. Or would have. You see, as soon as I sat down and had my first cup of tea, my body started to rebel. I went to the bathroom and stood over the sink for about 10 minutes before Dan came to find me. I&#8217;d officially had the buscuit, and headed home.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what happened. I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d had that much. Maybe I did, and just don&#8217;t remember. Either way, though, the walk home wasn&#8217;t pleasant. I wasn&#8217;t sick, just really dizzy. It wasn&#8217;t like any enbriated state I&#8217;d experienced. Mind you, my memory was a little off, so it wasn&#8217;t easy to tell.<br />
Speaking of memory, mine was so shot that I didn&#8217;t wake up until 8:30, thanks to Tamara making noise in the bathroom. Crap. I hauled ass and was out of the house in less than 10 minutes, arriving at work just over an hour late. I depleted the Bistro&#8217;s supply of ginger ale. Ate several slices of banana bread. But it wasn&#8217;t until the greasy A&amp;W lunch that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Thank god we only do this once a year&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple of weeks ago, we received a note in our inboxes that Thelton McMillan, the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) had left Critical Mass. Needless to say, this had come as a bit of a shock to the staff, who had not expected something like this to happen.<br />
The reasons for the departure were a bit nebulous, since we weren&#8217;t entirely sure what was truth and what was made up to soften the blow. The official story was that Thelton had done what he was hired to do (restructure Critical Mass into a professionally-managed organization; we were previously more fly by the seat of our pants), and had run out of challenges. Not able to extend himself further, he felt it was time to move on.<br />
To a large extend, Thelton will be missed. Good leadership is hard to find, and that he was, despite his initial introduction to Critical Mass.<br />
When I returned to Critical Mass after my stint with the CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train (see [[Home for a rest]]), Thelton had come on to replace Di during her maternity leave. The Friday of that week, I got my first formal introduction &#8230; when he went on a massive rant about Critical Mass&#8217;s value system, respect, and responsibilities.<br />
He almost instigated a mass exodus. In the span of a few minutes, Thelton pretty much managed to piss of the department with the worst morale in the company. He never apologized for what he said, nor should he have. There was a new wind blowing at Critical Mass, and we were just figuring out what it was.<br />
Over the course of a few months, Thelton turned that relationship around. It took a lot of trust (and to be sure, there were those who never did fully trust him), but the results that came around as a result of his initiatives were undeniable. Politics within the departments aside, the transition went pretty well. (As some of you know, I had pretty major issues with how the transition went within Technology.)<br />
So tonight, many of us came out to bid Thelton a proper farewell. (Especially those of us who have benefitted greatly at his generousity when buying rounds of drinks at various Critical Mass events.)<br />
Departing from Critical Mass shortly after 17:00, Scott and I drove down to 15th Ave. and 5th St. SW, about a block from Bungalow (the lounge formally known as Pongo, since redesigned and reopened), which was our destination. There, we found John, one of our DBAs, trying to find the bar.<br />
Only a handful of people had arrived. The group had doubled 20 minutes later, and double again 20 minutes after that. Thelton and Christy arrived about 15 minutes after we did. Scott had to leave about 18:00; I had to leave before 18:30. It could have easily ended up being a major bender (had I not had existing plans, no doubt I would have hung around to the bitter end). Instead, I had a chat with Thelton and Garth, getting a feel for Thelton&#8217;s plans.<br />
I bid adieu to Thelton as I headed out to my car. I don&#8217;t know when our paths will cross again. I only hope that they will.<br />
Picking up Alex from home, we headed out to Banff (Bamf!). The entire Tisdale clan (extended or otherwise) along with friends were gathering. Tomorrow is Pam&#8217;s wedding.<br />
The drive out was filled with conversation, but after a long day, I was happy to get there and get ourselves squared away. Too bad that ended up being more difficult than it should have been.<br />
It appears the staff at the Banff Park Lodge are a little on the dense side. Aunt Brenda had booked four rooms: one for Brenda, Mike, and Jen; one for Cathy and Craig; one for Mom and Nana; and one for Alex and myself. We were the last to arrive, but there were no rooms left under Brenda&#8217;s name. Two were gone, and the remaining two had been switched to Cathy and Mom.<br />
I piled back into the car to run out and find Cathy and Craig at the St. James Gate, an Irish pub about two blocks away, where everyone was meeting starting at 20:00. We had passed C&amp;C on the way over, so I knew they&#8217;d be there.<br />
Alex&#8217;s introduction to C&amp;C was on the sidewalk outside the pub in the cold weather. Not exactly an ideal situation, but you can&#8217;t always control everything. Cathy was certain that we were in room 105.<br />
The four of us returned to the hotel, Cathy going to retrieve Aunt Brenda. As the story boiled out, Uncle Mike (who had arrived earlier) checked in at the front desk, and was assigned to #105, despite his wife being in #104. He&#8217;d even dumped his things in the room.<br />
Keys in hand, bags in room, car parked underground, and introductions more or less complete, Cathy, Craig, Alex, Mom, Brenda, and I all headed over to the pub. The room in the back was already fairly full, but we managed to squish into a table.<br />
We had a couple of drinks, chatted a while (Mom and Brenda left after about a half an hour), until just after 22:00, when Alex and I decided to head off in the direction of the Hot Springs. (There was another minor reason that was the initiator, but it&#8217;s not particularly relevant.) Jen came with us. It was raining a bit as we drove up, chatting with one another. I dropped Jen and Alex off at the building and went to park the car. They were waiting for me when we arrived. Despite Jen being a couple inches taller than me, she still qualifies as a child.<br />
I was the first out of the change room. The pool was empty. For a moment, I thought it might be closed. But it turns out, on what seems to be an uber-rare event, there was no-one else in the pool. The springs didn&#8217;t close until 23:00, and it being only about 22:25 or so, the pool was all mine.<br />
Well, for about two minutes, which is when Alex joined me, followed a couple minutes later by Jen. For about 10 minutes, the pool was all ours. We were then joined by a pair of women, who stayed primarily at the cooler end of the pool. We went from the hotter section to laying in the &#8220;children&#8217;s&#8221; area and back. I finally bailed about 23:50, when nausea began to set in. Top sign you&#8217;ve been in too long&#8230;<br />
The evening was much more comfortable with the benefits that come from relaxing in that pool. I almost wish I lived in Banff so I could buy and annual pass, and go to the pool whenever I liked. Such as it is, I can&#8217;t.<br />
Maybe this means I need a hottub&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s something about driving like a maniac that makes for an interesting afternoon.<br />
I&#8217;ve been working on the Mercedes-Benz USA account for over four years now. In all that time, the closest I&#8217;ve ever come to a Benz are the ones I see driving down the street, or the ones we caught in the 2004 Calgary Auto Show.<br />
That is, until today.<br />
Exactly how this was worked out, I&#8217;m not sure, and I&#8217;m not one to pry. All I know is that it was not only well worth my time, but it was a heap of fun. Through an announcement we received from Thelton (likely arranged through Dan, who was on vacation until today), we found that Critical Mass had arranged to attend one of Mercedes-Benz Canada&#8217;s Ride and Drive events. This would give us first-hand exposure to the products we market.<br />
First, though, we had to go through a product seminar. Or at least that&#8217;s what we were told it would be. As it turned out, the presentation had become an episode of &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221;. The team was broken into five teams, each with a speaker. The speaker was to answer the question (or question the answer, in this particular case).<br />
In some cases, the questions were correct, and points awarded. In my team&#8217;s case, represented by Jason, they were not. Christine was kind enough to tally our final score at about -$10,000.<br />
Immediately following the &#8220;seminar&#8221;, we headed to our own personal vehicles (or other&#8217;s if we were getting a lift, which I was), and headed towards the southeast to Race City Speedway.<br />
The event was to start at 14:00, at least according to the website. It was already underway when we arrived around 13:30, although you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of people there.<br />
Race City Speedway is on the bare outskirts of Calgary. It&#8217;s been there for decades, and it shows. It&#8217;s not the most glamourous place: the main parking lot is ratty gravel, the dirt oval looks like it hadn&#8217;t seen a spot of paint in at least 10 years, the timing tower&#8217;s seen a couple of improvements probably in recent times, though iffy, and the bleachers &#8230; well, you won&#8217;t catch me sitting on them any time soon.<br />
That said, the Speedway has a quarter-mile track for drag racing, and a small course for road racing. It was where the quarter mile track starts that Mercedes had set up the entry tent. There we received our tags, denoting us as participants in the event. Exiting the tent, we found the collected inventories of the Hyatt and Lonestar Mercedes-Benz dealerships neatly lined up for viewing. (One of the salesmen would later tell me that Murphy arranged to have their dealerships swamped with customers on the two days the cars weren&#8217;t there).<br />
We were ferried down from the cars to the first of the three event pieces. We were either driven in an ML350 or an S500. I opted for the S500, since I have no interest in the M-Class. The S-Class is a nice line, though I know I have no hope of ever affording one.<br />
The Ride and Drive event is put on by Mercedes-Benz Canada as a sales gimmick. The idea is to go beyond the ordinary test drive, to get a chance to push the car to do the things you wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to do in a normal test drive. The event is actually run by a completely different company, though.<br />
There are three activities at the Ride and Drive: the slalom, the C55 challenge, and braking and handling. This was the order I did them in, too, though I initially had no peticular desire to go near the C55. Details on that in a moment&#8230;<br />
The slalom is a fairly simple thing. The course is a loop, about 250 metres long, and about 15 metres wide. You drive down one side, at a fairly brisk pace, getting to know what the car is like in sharp corners. The course then turns around to return the way you came, with a jog to the left, then back to the right, and a stop sign just before the start/finish line.<br />
Jen, our Product Specialist (she ran the &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; game), and I piled into a C230 Kompressor for the slalom. Jen took the first run, whipping in and out of the pylons that marked the edges of the curves, before whipping around the end, and bursting to the stop sign. We reached the end quite quickly, and we swapped. I don&#8217;t know how fast Jen did the course, but I think I ran it at about 50 km/h. I only hit one pylon. Others in our team were not quite so lucky, both Mabel and Jeff got lectures from the officials about their driving.<br />
I have to say that I have changed my opinion of the C230 Kompressor. I built the microsite for the Mercedes-Benz USA launch a few years ago. I came to loathe and despise the vehicle. I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it. I actually tried to avoid driving it, opting for the C230 Sport Sedan instead. But somehow, it worked out that I got a chance to experience a car that, until today, I hated. Funny how things happen.<br />
As we watched others running the course, Robb finished his run in the C55, proclaiming:<br />
&#8220;You guys have gotta try this!&#8221;<br />
The C55 activity wasn&#8217;t really &#8220;active&#8221;. The C55 is the top of the line in the C-Class line, running about CDN$75,000 base. It&#8217;s an AMG, which is Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s custom sport line. It&#8217;s powerful, about 360 horsepower. It&#8217;s not the sort of thing that Mercedes-Benz is going to willingly let us drive. So they brought in a professional race car driver.<br />
Jen, Marcie, and I donned crash helmets and piled into the C55, Marcie in the front passenger seat, myself behind Marcie, and Jen next to me. The driver smirked through his visor, and the car took off, probably due to the massive ACME rockets strapped to the sides. (Well, okay, it felt like it.)<br />
The course isn&#8217;t long, maybe a kilometre in total length. Of course, pulling corners at 160 kilometres an hour eats up track very quickly. The locks on the seatbelts kicked in almost immediately, and stayed engaged until we got to the end.<br />
The driver didn&#8217;t hit the brake once. Marcie cried: &#8220;Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod&#8221; as we rounded the corners, hanging on to whatever would keep us in our seats. The driver asked if we wanted to slow down. There was a doubly-defiant &#8220;NO!&#8221; from the backseat. Marcie was relieved when the ride was finally over.<br />
The next activity, just down the way from the C55 was hands-on: braking and handling. The task is fairly simple: drive as fast as possible towards a tight, short s-curve to the right, taking the turn while braking. Then come around for a straight-away run back in the direction we came in, running at full speed towards a stop sign, braking to the point where the ABS has to kick in. The idea, of course, is to find out what the cars handle like under the conditions.<br />
We had the choice of a C230 Sports Sedan, the S600, an ML350, and an E500. When I found out that the C230 had a manual transmission, I couldn&#8217;t resist the chance to give it a whirl. Scott (from our Research and Analytics group) hopped in the passenger seat.<br />
The clutch and the shift was a bit &#8220;squishy&#8221; (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that), but I got up to about 100 km/h before reaching the corner. It wasn&#8217;t easy to see (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that, either), and the car handled the braking and turning quite well &#8212; far better than I had expected.<br />
The return run was almost too much fun. Having (more or less) figured out the clutch&#8217;s sweet spot, I accelerated to over 120 km/h before I got to the stop. I popped the gear to neutral, and tried to put the brake through the floorboard. Nary a squeal from the tires, and the car came to a very quick halt.<br />
I would do the run again in an E500, but only as a passenger. It was a noticeable difference, mostly in that the E500 doesn&#8217;t handle as well. It is a bigger engine, but it&#8217;s also a bigger car.<br />
The smell of burning rubber was everywhere. If it wasn&#8217;t us smoking the tires on the slalom course (we regularly did &#8230; though I don&#8217;t believe *I* did), it was us squealing on the braking and handling course. Naturally, the C55 did have a bit of residual afterburn from the hard driving.<br />
We even managed to set off the brake overheat alarm on the E500.<br />
I have to say, I was duly impressed by the Mercedes-Benz lineup that we got to try. I somehow doubt that I&#8217;ll ever own one, mostly because I simply don&#8217;t get paid enough for one. (Besides, I do like my Mini.) What did I get out of all this today, then? A better appreciation for them, which is something you simply can&#8217;t get looking at pictures.<br />
Afterwards, we all headed over to one of the local pubs (Duck and Firkin, Fox and Gherkin, Bob and Merklin &#8230; something like that) for a few rounds. It gave us all a chance to recount our specific tales of automotive achievement, and ridicule each other about the dumb things we did.<br />
&#8216;Cuz hey, if you can&#8217;t mock your co-workers, what other reason do you have for working?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, My Favourite Giant left Critical Mass. And we are lessened by his departure.<br />
Luke Puxley started at Critical Mass not quite two years ago. He was a daunting figure, mostly due to his sheer size. Luke is not a small man, though he never played the &#8220;big man&#8221; role. He was simply a larger version of EveryMan. He was kind, funny, helpful, thoughtful, intelligent, and hard-working.<br />
And he liked to goof off just as much as the rest of us. Maybe moreso.<br />
Luke was &#8220;My Favourite Giant&#8221; to some of us, &#8220;The Giant&#8221; to others, &#8220;Sir Bonks-A-Lot&#8221; to a precious few, but was as much a Critical Masser as the rest of us. He will be forever immortalized in a sketch prepared for our summer Town Hall (see [[Critical Mass Summer Town Hall and Kananaskis Cowpunch]]), most notably for his portrayal of a hard-working, sweat, big guy. (Come to think of it, some of us are still haunted by those images&#8230;)<br />
So it was simply natural that we have to make a final burst for Luke as he heads his way to an MBA. Yesterday, Mark arranged for a lunch at the Drum and Monkey, which I couldn&#8217;t attend due to an interview I had to conduct. (For the record, I don&#8217;t much like the Drum and Monkey for lunch, anyway. Too much food, and the service is lousy.) We would make a go of the usual run of things: Vicious Circle and sushi afterwards.<br />
Late because of a long-running conference call, I arrived at VC shortly after 17:40. Festivities were already well underway. Although we didn&#8217;t have a massive gathering, there were at least 25 people in attendance. Not shabby for someone who&#8217;d been mired on the Mercedes account for three-quarters of his employ.<br />
Friday afternoon was sunny and warm, and sitting on the patio of VC was something we all could enjoy. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Critical Mass team dominated the east side of the patio. We could have packed in more people, but were snubbed by Steve and Jana, and later by Thelton and Christie (though they had a better excuse &#8212; anniversaries do tend to take precendence).<br />
As afternoon turned into early evening, attendees started to drop off. The call for sushi went out, but acquired only a handful of takers: Scott, Linday, Luke, Reid, and yours truly. When minimal mass (the opposite of critical mass &#8212; when a sufficiently small number requires the dissolution of a particular state) was finally attained, the five of us headed over to the Sumo Lounge in Eau Claire Market (convenient for Luke, Lindsay, and myself, since we all live within walking distance).<br />
We had a booth to ourselves, thankfully away from everyone else. Why thankfully? Because we were loud.<br />
Okay, <em>I</em> was loud.<br />
One litre of sake between the five of us. Luke eventually cut himself off (it was a bit much for him). Peter Kinjo, the owner and Chief Troublemaker, made a point to come around and spread his unique brand of cheer. No dancing for Luke in a rubber wig and kimono, though &#8212; I suspect they wouldn&#8217;t have fit him, anyway.<br />
Departing Sumo, all of us but Reid (he was heading out to join up with Jim) headed upstairs to the Cineplex to play some air hockey. Luke went down in the first round, but it wasn&#8217;t an easy one. (Sake really destroys hand-eye coordination.) He&#8217;d get his revenge later on. We went around to various video games before deciding to give pool a shot. Somehow, we ended up playing darts instead. That took a while, since none of the four of us were any good.<br />
Oh, and that round of bottle caps (drinks, not the candy) didn&#8217;t really help, either.<br />
Scott and I finished a round of pool while waiting for Luke and Linday to finish their darts game. Despite having a near total lack of coordination at this point, I was able to aim surprisingly well. The lack of coordination finally showed through when Luke took me down in a final game of air hockey.<br />
With that, we all headed out into the unusually warm Calgary evening, Luke and Linday heading up to Crescent Heights, Scott and I heading over to my place in Sunnyside. I offered to give Scott a ride home, but needed to sit down a while and rest before getting behind a wheel. (Just because I&#8217;m inebriated doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m irresponsible.)<br />
We watched The Simpsons on DVD before I was inspired to put on The Great Escape. I fell asleep barely into the movie (I was exhausted), waking up about an hour or so in. By this point, it was almost 3:00. I took Scott home, hitting the sack almost as soon as I got back.<br />
The office will certainly be a quieter place without Luke around anymore. But we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see him from time to time.<br />
After all, he&#8217;s gonna miss us at the breakfast table.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s 23:00 Sunday night, and this is the first time in four days that I&#8217;ve had a chance to be alone with my computer.<br />
Not that I&#8217;m necessarily complaining, I might add.<br />
The last four days have been a mad combination of work-related mayhem, drunken debauchery (see: work-related mayhem), and spending time with Alex. All of it has been great fun, which is why I need two entries to cover it all. But first, the work-related mayhem and drunken debauchery &#8230; more or less in that order.<br />
Every six months, Critical Mass holds a Town Hall. It&#8217;s a gathering of everyone in the company, remote offices included, to listen to information the company wishes to disseminate in a semi-public forum. The Town Halls held in January are mostly business. Numbers, facts, trends&#8230; you usually need several strong coffees to get you through them. But the ones in June are a special breed &#8212; it&#8217;s more of a show than real information. It&#8217;s almost an excuse to leave the office and watch a bunch of people entertain the rest of us, gain a bit more information than we already did, and then go drinking.<br />
At least, that&#8217;s what this one was like.<br />
We gathered at the Vertigo Theatre, in the basement of the Calgary Tower complex downtown, not far from the office. This apparently used to be an old movie theatre, now converted into fairly nice stage theatres. When we arrived in the lobby, we were split into small groups (for what reason, I wasn&#8217;t initially certain. When our group was called, we walked over to the theatre door, but were thrown up against the wall, and subjected to what I can only describe as a severe infraction of the Geneva Convention. We had to sing The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;Macho Man&#8221;.<br />
This was courtesy of Dan, my business unit&#8217;s Managing Director. He was strung out on something (either far too much caffeine, or something far more exotic), wearing a microphone of a style made famous by Garth Brooks, and yelling like he was on TV. Apparently, so were we. As Phillipe filmed, we were made to cheer, laugh, heckle, and boo. Then came the song. We were quite puzzled, to say the least. It came quite clear when we entered the theatre, only to find the next group after us being subjected to the same humilation &#8212; broadcast onto a large screen on the stage.<br />
Once everyone had been put through the wringer and the auditorium was full, we began the show. Dan walked out on stage, still wearing the mike, announcing that he was the stage manager of this freak show, and it was time to get it going. So with no further adieu, he welcome onstage the announcer, the man with the best radio voice in the company, Scott. Naturally, this precipitated a loud cheer from those of us who work with him. Scott then took over, bringing on the musical host of this wacky production, which was to no-one&#8217;s surprise, our sound engineer, Dewi. And then came the host, the man who puts the &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;loser&#8221; (bit of an in-joke, due to his last name), my *boss*, Allard.<br />
*That* suprised me. No, actually, that *stunned* me. I simply did not see that coming. But the fact that he was hosting the little deal was nothing compared with the fact that he was not only good at what he did, he was *amazing*. As I would find out later, almost none of Allard&#8217;s material was scripted (at least so that he had to remember it). He either only had vague directions leading to some dialogue, or completely adlibbed. His opening monologue was actually very funny. He even caught our CEO, Jerry, completely off-guard by calling him by his initials: JJ &#8230; and JK, JL, JM, J-Lo. (Jerry&#8217;s reactions to Allard&#8217;s off-the-cuff comments were almost as entertaining as the comments.)<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;ve challenged Allard to keep this up for our meetings. He&#8217;ll make them a lot more interesting.<br />
Several videos peppered the skits that the group put on. The group included the five previously mentioned, Thelton, Dave, Carl (who did a great job presenting the true direction of the company), two Peters, Simone, Robb, Chrissie, Ed, Jason, Arif (a mainstay of all our Town Halls), and &#8220;guest appearances&#8221; by Cory, Colin, and the infamous rubber chicken. While the chicken incident kind of bombed (the joke was a little abused as of late), the videos had people rolling in many cases.<br />
The bulk of the actual business information came from the rather lengthy Q&amp;A session with Thelton and Jerry, kicked off by the question that all inquiring minds wanted to know: Boxers or briefs? While Thelton and JZ were hoping to avoid some of the more numbers-related questions, they invariably arose (hard not to, I guess). But they were all answered. And we ended the session early.<br />
Early enough for the aforementioned debauchery.<br />
This year, we ended up at the Whiskey. They weren&#8217;t ready for us when we arrived, and the poor bartender upstairs had to run around frantically to get ready. We got there about an hour ahead of time. But frankly, that&#8217;s not an excuse. The inside of the Whiskey was dead. Can you expect me to believe that they couldn&#8217;t have had the upstairs ready in time? Not swift, if you ask me. But soon enough, we were getting loaded, and that&#8217;s all that really matters.<br />
A water gun made an appearance, weilded by Thelton. (You got to love a President who&#8217;s willing to be as immature as the rest of us.) Adrian tackled him to get it away and hose down others. I got wet on a few occassions, but didn&#8217;t care so long as the camera stayed dry.<br />
Before I knew it, the sun was setting, and a group of us were heading over to the Bear and Kilt to continue festivities. The antics, including spilled beers (on the pool table, so I gather &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t me, incidentally), spilled french fries and beef dip sauce (that was me), and probably more than a few spilled secrets (don&#8217;t know if that was me or not &#8212; I was very drunk by then) flowed about. By after 1:00, it was time to go home.<br />
Mark, Amy, and I wandered down 4th St. to take Amy home. Mark headed off at 17th Ave., with the two of us continuing south. Amy offered to put me up at her place overnight, but I needed to get home for my cameras for the following morning. Despite two stops for hangover prevention, I woke up with a killer headache.<br />
Just in time for the Kananaskis Cowpunch.<br />
&#8220;What on Earth is that?&#8221; you might be asking. This is the name for this year&#8217;s company summer event. Arriving at the office (holding my head and liberally drinking a bottle of Gatorade), we waited for the signal to board our buses and head out to the Rafter 6 Ranch, not far from Exshaw. There, we would engage in activities that would have nothing to do with our daily job. This included golf (nine holes), white water rafting, horseback riding (western-style), yoga, hiking, or canoeing. Me? I chose to do nothing, and take pictures instead.<br />
Why? Well, I don&#8217;t have my own clubs, and I play cross-country golf. (I&#8217;m pretty bad.) I&#8217;ve done white water rafting on the Kicking Horse River three times &#8212; the Kananaskis River just ain&#8217;t gonna cut it. I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of horses, so riding was out. As for yoga, while I do love it, I&#8217;m very partial to my yoga instructor, Lori, and wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for someone different. Hiking didn&#8217;t sound interesting at first, though I found out later that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have minded it. As for canoeing, it was in a 12-person canoe. That&#8217;s a dragonboat to me, which is not really quite what I had in mind for relaxing.<br />
Besides, *someone* needs to take the pictures.<br />
The weather in Calgary and area as of late resembled that of Vancouver &#8212; wet and miserable. Cyndy, our office manager and the one who organized most of this, was unbelievably relieved to see that the weather had panned out. She swore that things weren&#8217;t going to work out. But the sun was out, the weather was warm, and clouds were few and far between. Almost as soon as we arrived at the Ranch (the golfers went direct to the course), the groups went off to get ready.<br />
I wandered down to where the horse riders were gathered to hop on their mounts. The horses were not the happiest animals I&#8217;ve ever seen. They&#8217;re either extremely well-trained, or (and I hate to suggest it) abused. They didn&#8217;t move very much, and didn&#8217;t seem particularly energetic. As I don&#8217;t know horse behaviour that well, I can only assume (and hope) that Rafter 6 Ranch follows proper animal treatment guidelines.<br />
Over at the rafting shed, the majority of the CM group was getting their waivers sorted out (which apparently contained some clause about bears, of all things) and preparing to get their equipment to head out. I really wanted to get photos of the rafters on the water, but as I had no idea where they were setting in (it wasn&#8217;t at the Ranch), I had to settle for some group shots pre-wetsuits.<br />
I passed back and forth between the horse riders (it took a while to get them all on horseback) and the rafters (it took a while to get them all in rubber) until both groups had headed off. Luke, the largest person in the rafting group, looked about the most uncomfortable in his wetsuit. I so desperately wanted a picture of him in his neoprene skin, but he wisely declined.<br />
The horses were mostly watching people who have either never ridden a horse, or looked very uncomfortable on a horse, waiting around for the rest of the group (there would be two waves) to get their horse. Some people were fairly even with their steeds, and aside from a bit of uneasiness, were ready to ride. Some, like Jamie, looked like they&#8217;d never been on a horse before (Jamie actually said: &#8220;How does this thing work?&#8221; &#8212; it was hard to tell if he was serious or not).<br />
Then there was Garth. Garth is our DBA Manager. Garth seemed to really know what he was doing. I even commented on it.<br />
Me: Garth, you sound like an old ranch hand!<br />
Garth: I am.<br />
Figures I&#8217;d meet a DBA Manager who grew up on a farm south of Edmonton, who rode horses for the better part of a decade.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that there weren&#8217;t a couple of problems. Terri&#8217;s horse suddenly decided to not want to cooperate and reared up. Terri, fearing a bucking, grabbed the reins to keep from falling off. Sadly, not the correct course of action, as pulling back on the reins only makes the horse rear more. It took a few quick commands from the handlers to keep Terri from falling off.<br />
Horses off and rafters away, I wandered back up to our portion of the ranch to hang out for the next couple of hours. There, I found Cyndy and Lindsay, who had beers in hand. It appeared the bar was officially open.<br />
And everyone else thought I was missing out on activities&#8230;<br />
We chatted a while, admiring the surrounding area. The Rafter 6 is located in a wonderful little pocket of Kananaskis, within spitting distance of the mountains without actually being in them. And far enough away from the highway that you can&#8217;t hear it. Just the wind, the birds, the odd nickering of a horse, wind through the trees, and the river (once you get close enough to it, anyway).<br />
The Ranch is about 200 years old, so I&#8217;m told. It&#8217;s also massive, though I suspect much of the land has either been turned into random pasture land (instead of the need for huge expanses for cattle) with some turned over to other interests (there&#8217;s a YMCA camp &#8220;next door&#8221;, which I imagine was once part of the ranch itself). But there&#8217;s still ample room to wander around. The grounds have several buildings, including the hotel, dining hall, barn, several cabins, and the chapel (which was where the yoginis practiced their moves &#8212; quite a beautiful sight from where we were).<br />
Lindsay and I decided to go off on a short walk to find the others in our &#8220;do nothing&#8221; group. We headed down to the river (we understood that Pavel had brought a fishing rod), babbling the whole way there and back. We never found the rest of the group, but did have a nice walk, nonetheless.<br />
Lunch was not far off when we got back, which was about the time that the hikers, horse riders, and rafter returned. Yoga had finished, the participants changed and lounging around. Slowly, but surely, the group was regathering. Cyndy and I went out to meet the horse riders as they trotted through. Cyndy was having far too much fun with everyone else, and commented that they&#8217;d all be walking bow-legged for a while. Someone commented about needing a rub-down &#8230; then Harjinder commented about needing some Vaseline. I nearly dropped the camera from laughing so hard.<br />
Lunch was hamburgers, chicken, vegetable shishkebabs, baked beans, and salads. Following what most of us considered to be normal buffet behaviour, we grabbed two hamburger buns and got in line. One burger each. Fine, we&#8217;ll just come back later. Apparently, Rafter 6 had only enough buns so that we&#8217;d have *one* burger each. One. Just one. Uh, hello? It&#8217;s a barbecue. No-one has just *one*. Sliced bread had to come out for everyone else. The golfers finally showed up as the first round of lunch was wrapping up.<br />
After lunch, we had completely unstructure free time. This led Luke, Torin, and myself to go way out into the fields and throw around Luke&#8217;s aerobee (basically, a flying ring, as opposed to the standard Frisbee). My aim was way off for the first little while, and I made Luke and Torin run a bit. I eventually grew tired of the activity, and resumed photography.<br />
I was waiting for the &#8220;surprise&#8221;. At 14:30, we were told to head down to the rodeo corral for the remainder of the afternoon. This was for a rodeo, though not with any animals other than horses. This was a volunteer rodeo, where various members of the staff would hop on a horse and make a horse&#8217;s ass of themselves. Which, of course, is the point.<br />
More food would await us. As I approached the rodeo corral, I saw a large group of people milling around something, then walking off with &#8230; ICE CREAM! Changing my direction, I went in direction of something cold and yummy. I had thought the vessel holding the cool treats was a freezer of some kind. But we were on a ranch &#8212; the ice cream was contained in soft-sided insulated bags, slung over the back of a miniature horse. It was very cute, although the little guy REALLY hated the bags, and didn&#8217;t really appreciate 200 somewhat drunk people surrounding it.<br />
The rodeo was quite simple: a corral, six horses, and a few interesting games. First up was Musical Horses. Similar to musical chairs, the idea is to walk your horse around a ring of tires. When the music stops, you jump down and put one foot in the tire. The rest is pretty self-explanatory. Then there was the egg race, which is a lap around the corral holding an egg on a spoon. Following that was a race where two people (on different horses) had to hold a piece of plastic tape between them. First ones across the finish line still holding the tape between them won. Then came the barrel race, a rodeo mainstay, involving a little more horsemanship to get around all the barrels. A bizarre relay race came afterwards, involving two riders per horse and a few transgender clothing swaps. The final race was the favourite: the beer race. That&#8217;s when six riders run to the other end, chug a beer (you have to turn it upside down over your head to prove you&#8217;ve finished), then race back.<br />
Musical horses was quite funny. Dan got stuck with the smallest horse, which he seemed rather proud about. Dan was quite adept with his little horse, out-maneuvering several others, only to finally be defeated because his horse wanted to grandstand instead of co-operate. The music, incidentally, was the rest of us singing &#8220;100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall&#8221;, which went something like this:<br />
&#8220;100 bottles of beer on the wall, 100 bottles of beer, [incoherent mumbling following the tune of the song], 99 bottles of beer on the wall&#8230;&#8221; and so on.<br />
Partway through the rodeo, I opted to go get another ice cream. It was hot, and they&#8217;re tasty. And that&#8217;s all the excuse I need, darn it! When I got out there, the wee little horsie wasn&#8217;t in much better of a mood than when I&#8217;d first come across him. In fact, as I attempted to get my ice cream bar, the little bugger got out of his bridle, and started to pull away. His handler tried to hang onto him, but only got one of the refrigerator bags off instead. Released of the grip, he was off like a shot, tearing away at a rate you couldn&#8217;t have convinced me a little thing like that could do! He even kept up with the bigger horses. One of the ranch hands took off after him with a lasso. Had my hands not been full, I would have been able to get the whole event on video.<br />
The egg race was a little dull, other than all the fallen eggs, of course. The tape race was only amusing insofar as watching Evelyn and Jamie try to stay on their horses and still hang onto the tape. Jamie&#8217;s prowess with a horse is &#8230; well, nigh non-existant, so he was having difficulties staying with Evelyn. The barrel race was a bit of a heart-stopper when Marcie fell off when her horse came to a dead halt as it prepared to go around the last barrel. Thankfully, she was alright. Moments later, the same thing nearly happened to the next person, but recovered in time. The clothes race was something to watch, if only to see Jerry in a frilly woman&#8217;s bathing suit.<br />
The beer race was the contentious one. It came down to two key competitors: Bill and Chris. On the first race, Bill won but was called out for supposedly not drinking all of his beer (on video replay, there was a bit too much landing on his hat). Chris, reported to be the fasted guzzle in the west, probably felt a bit cheated. So there was a rematch, pitting the two (and Lindsay, who came in third) to resolve the issue. This time, Chris raced to success, with Bill a little more drunk for wear.<br />
The rodeo over, we all headed back to the dining area to relax until the busses were called &#8212; not long afterwards. By this point, I was resembling a lobster (or rather, I was told I was; in reality I wasn&#8217;t nearly that bad), and felt it wise to head out on the first wave of busses. However, I should have waited for the fourth and final bus.<br />
Those who did engaged in what I could only imagine to be the wildest bus party the company has ever seen. Cyndy was so loopy, she was tossing clothing out the window as it went down the road (I have no idea whose it was). Waterguns were soaking everything in sight. Thelton decided to try and sneak up on Shawn, our Account Director in Austin, crawling along the aisle floor on all fours. Shawn, however, saw Thelton coming, crawled over two rows of chairs to empty his beer onto Thelton&#8217;s head. A pit stop at a Petro-Canada set off a round of stickering (mostly on people) and a run on beef jerky. Somewhere along the line, Cyndy declared something about &#8220;getting nekkid&#8221; and swapped shirts with Jim.<br />
*Sigh* I miss all the fun.<br />
We were to head to Coyotes after arriving back at Critical Mass. There we engaged in more games of &#8220;see how many drink tickets we can get from Thelton&#8221;, among babbling with each other. Staying at Coyotes was not an option, however. Coyotes is not really my first choice for a good bar to go to &#8230; actually, it would be my *last* choice, along with Cowboys and Tantra (formerly The Drink). Such as it was, however, the beer was free, and that was reason enough.<br />
Luke, Allison, James, Torin, Scott, Natalia, Wendy, Alain, Gary, and myself vacated (long before the Miss Corona pageant was to start, thankfully) and went to Sumo over in Eau Claire Market. There we gorged ourselves on Japanese (mostly sushi) and swapped stories about the day. As the sun slowly set, a chill came over. About 30 minutes before we left, Torin barked out &#8220;Hey Jerks!&#8221; to someone passing by the patio we were on. It was Jerry, Scott (from Chicago) and Shawn. Jerry whipped around to see who had insulted him. Seeing it was just us, he barked back: &#8220;F*ck you!&#8221; We laughed.<br />
The evening over, I retreated back to my safe little home to recover from the day. Lest you think I was heavily intoxicated at the time &#8212; I was very sober. In fact, I&#8217;d spent the whole day pretty much peachy. Not driveable-peachy, but not even really buzzed. Hangovers tend to make you not want to drink as much the next day, I find. No, the reason I went home was that I was very, very tired.<br />
And after the last two days, I needed the rest.<br />

<p>(I&#8217;ve been wanting to quote that bit for <em>years</em>.)<br />
Another veteran of Critical Mass&#8217;s Web Development ranks is heading for greener pastures, palm trees, and dates with Hollywood models (we can only assume). It half came as a surprise, the rest as a disappointed sadness, when I found out that Jude Matsalla was leaving.<br />
Jude has been at Critical Mass for well over five years. Jude was always one of our innovators, one of those people who always pushed the envelope for all the really interesting ideas, someone the rest of us always looked up to. (Especially because Jude was always approachable, no matter how much stress he was under. Something I still need to work on.) He got an opportunity to move down to Pasedena for a while and check out the American life. Like several before him, he will be missed.<br />
Chrissie, one of our long-time veterans of Project Management, couldn&#8217;t let Jude go without a fight. So she organized a send-up for him, to ensure that Jude would remember his time at Critical Mass. (I would have assumed he&#8217;d get the usual Critical Mass logo cattle brand, but I guess since Jude&#8217;s a vegetarian, the only logical thing was mental trauma.) So was planned a three-event outing on Friday evening.<br />
Stop number one was at Ming, a trendy bar cum bistro on 17th Avenue. I&#8217;ve been there a couple of time before, but it&#8217;s never really been one of my more favourite places, especially when you&#8217;re with a large group. It&#8217;s just hard to get the people in that tiny little space. But being true to the Critical Mass spirit (which, in many ways, resembles university fraternities), we crammed in everyone who wanted to come out.<br />
Scott, Luke, and I walked down from the office, partly because we had no car, but also because Calgary was being blessed with a wonderfully warm day (for a change &#8212; May always has strange weather). As we approached Ming, we noticed two things: Thelton&#8217;s red Mini parked out front (Thelton got his Mini long after I got mine &#8212; the copycat! &#8212; but at least he got a different colour), and the City of Calgary Parking Enforcement car pulling up behind it. (You&#8217;re not allowed to park on 17th Ave. until after 18:00.) Thelton was quickly warned, and managed to avoid a ticket.<br />
We were among the earlier ones to arrive, but soon the Mass started to appear, and all were packed into the little space under the stairs. Eventually, we overflowed into other parts of the bar. People who didn&#8217;t normally come out to such events rounded out the list of usual suspects (but we never achieved the sheer outpouring seen at Ben Wong&#8217;s departure &#8212; see [[Three Parties and a Little Hockey]]), even if they were only out for a while.<br />
We were even joined by Rudy (one of our web developers) and his &#8220;manservant&#8221; Virgil (a former Critical Mass employee, and friend, of whom you&#8217;ve heard many times before). Rudy was in a motorcycle accident a couple of weeks ago, and has been out sick ever since. He hobbled into Ming on crutches to make an appearance. At which point we yelled:<br />
&#8220;If you&#8217;re good enough to come to a bar, you can whack out some code! Get your butt back to the office, ya slacker!&#8221;<br />
All in good jest, of course.<br />
The plan had been to adjourn to the second destination at 19:00, but we didn&#8217;t start moving until almost 20:00. James, Scott, Colin, Jude, and myself all piled into James&#8217; car, and we fired off in the direction of Lloyd&#8217;s, in the southern part of Calgary (north of Heritage Drive). Lloyd&#8217;s is an institution in Calgary &#8212; it&#8217;s where teenagers go to rollerskate.<br />
Yes, rollerskating. Wasn&#8217;t exactly on my list of things I have to do before I die. Colin and I took a bit of a detour, though, and opted for a pizza at Tom&#8217;s Pizza, instead. That, two beers, and a really long conversation. Colin and I have these every now and then. It really feels good to have them, because I really feel isolated from all the other developers being on the Mercedes account.<br />
Getting into Lloyd&#8217;s, we found James, Scott, and Jude hanging out with Chrissie, Jason, Jude&#8217;s cousin Vince, Rob, and Rob&#8217;s girlfriend (whose name I&#8217;ve forgotten). Colin and I didn&#8217;t bother with skates &#8212; neither of us were particularly interested. Instead, we watched as Jude attempted to jump from one chair to another, only to have his feet slide out from under him, and narrowly miss face-planting the floor. (Scott&#8217;s video capture will become an instant classic.)<br />
Not long after Colin and I arrived did the really bad music, lousy deejay, and the plethora of 15-year olds finally get to us, and we headed for older pastures. This took us to what we call the No Name Lounge. We call it that because, like the name suggests, it has no name. Literally. If you pass by on the street, you&#8217;d never know. There&#8217;s no name. Even the liquor license is numbered &#8212; no name. What do you tell your friends when you&#8217;re going to a place that has no name? It&#8217;s a little odd the first time.<br />
But it&#8217;s a nice place, and very cool. The interior is narrow, but long. It&#8217;s lit mostly by red lights, the deejay is an ex-Critical Mass employee who spins some amazing tunes (although we regularly complain that the deejay sucks, just for digs), and the decor is pretty chic &#8230; when you can actually see it. (The eyes take a few minutes to adjust.) This was our third and final stop for the night, where we hung out until the wee hours of the morning.<br />
Those of us from Lloyd&#8217;s were also joined by Mark, Carmen, Rudy, Virgil, Jason (two of them, actually), Laura, Michelle, Lindsay, Mabel, Shannon, and finally Pat (after Colin and I gave him grief for not showing up earlier). We never did see Angie, though. I finally left well into the next day, deciding that I&#8217;d had too much to drink, and desperately needed sleep.<br />
In all, it was a great departure. I could only hope that all parties are like this. I just hope we don&#8217;t have too many of them &#8212; my poor body can&#8217;t take all this.<br />
