	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are some rumours I understand. And there are others that I do not. There are some that I begin. But this is one I want to end.<br />
For years &#8212; literally, years &#8212; there is a rumour that&#8217;s been floating around Calgary that Critical Mass is going to lose the Mercedes-Benz USA account. We hear it every so often, usually from people in the industry or trying to get into the industry. But only people who work in Calgary &#8212; never from anywhere else. We used to hear this a lot more a couple of years ago. Back then, it was more a irritation. So imagine my surprise when it came up in an interview today.<br />
I think the last time I heard this rumour was when I&#8217;d been out with Virgil a couple of years ago (long before Chris left for Japan). I can&#8217;t quite remember the details, but Virgil&#8217;s friend was convinced we were going to lose the account, and his company was just going to sweep in there and take the business from us.<br />
What kills me is that this seems to be the prevailing attitude: that when Critical Mass loses the Mercedes-Benz USA account, someone in Calgary is going to get it. Okay, let&#8217;s have a little reality check here, okay? Critical Mass is about 200 people (don&#8217;t ask me for a specific number, simply because I don&#8217;t have one to give). If that 200 people, about 60 work on it full-time. That&#8217;s over 25% of our entire workforce, dedicated to a single account. Most interactive companies in Calgary aren&#8217;t 60 people in total, let alone that many to spare.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s assume for the moment that maybe &#8212; JUST MAYBE &#8212; you could handle something the side of Mercedes-Benz USA. What on Earth makes you think they&#8217;re coming back to Calgary? Just because Critical Mass is here? Maybe you think that Calgary&#8217;s cheapness offers an advantage? Maybe if you set up shop in, say, Moncton, you might have a chance. Believe me when I say that not only is Calgary not as cheap as it once was, there is a time difference which plays to be more of an inconvenience than you might imagine.<br />
Now to really sound like a jerk &#8212; who the hell do you think you are? As far as I know, there is ONE major interactive agency in town: Critical Mass. I know this because I keep an eye on the competition. And if you&#8217;re in Calgary, you&#8217;re not competition to Critical Mass. When we compete against companies like Agency.com, Organic, Modem Media, Sapient, Tribal, OgilvieInteractive, R/GA, and beat them out for contracts like NASA, Hyatt Hotels, Morgan Stanley, and Albertsons, that says something. When AdWeek lists you at #20 on their list of Top 50 Agencies, that says something.<br />
We have Mercedes-Benz USA because we&#8217;re good. And they know us.<br />
Think that&#8217;s not an issue? Think you can still win them over? Try this on for size. Not too long ago, Critical Mass went head-to-head with the heavyweights in the industry for a USD$12+ million contract. We *almost* won. Want to know why we didn&#8217;t? Because it would have cost the client too much money to move away from the agency they had. It boiled down to the pain point. And if for that reason alone, you&#8217;re not going to get Mercedes-Benz USA unless your company appears in AdWeek&#8217;s top 50 list.<br />
So please, if you work for an agency in Calgary, cash a reality check and realize that there is just no feasible away you can steal away an account that large. The industry has matured in the last four years. Big companies need established agencies. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re still here. And that&#8217;s why we aren&#8217;t going anywhere, except up, that is. If you&#8217;re so hell-bent on working on the Mercedes-Benz account, I can offer you one piece of advice:<br />
Apply for a job. We&#8217;re hiring.</p>

		<p>Psst! Hey, wanna hear something shocking? I&#8217;m taking yoga.<br />
Relax, I haven&#8217;t grown my hair out and gone hippy (well, the hair *has* grown out, but only because I haven&#8217;t had it cut in a month and a half), nor have I become a Stepford Wife. It&#8217;s the result of having talked to so many people about how good yoga is. I know, this kind of sounds like a &#8220;If Timmy jumped off a cliff&#8230;&#8221; thing. But admittedly, anything that&#8217;s been around for about 5,000 years and been practiced by countless millions of people can&#8217;t be all bad.<br />
Right?<br />
So when the rumour of a new yoga class starting up at work started running around, I make sure James kept me in the loop. Sure enough, when word officially came out, I forked over $80 and signed my life away (basically, a &#8220;I won&#8217;t sue you for anything stupid I do&#8221; form), bought a yoga mat (about six feet long, two and a half feet wide, and about 1/4 inch thick), and tried to prepare myself for something I&#8217;d never done before.<br />
The first class was a week ago yesterday. We had a class of about nine people (the full class will be about 10, but we have yet to have a full compliment), with participants from either Project Management or Technology, with one person from Creative. We all sit in the Theatre (chairs removed), while our instructor, Lori, leads us through the various motions.<br />
The first thing you need to know is that there isn&#8217;t just one yoga. In fact, there are 40 different kinds, such as Agni, Bhakti, Japa, Mantra, Tantra, and Hatha. The one we&#8217;re doing is called Ashtanga, which is &#8220;the unitive discipline of the eight limbs&#8221; &#8230; whatever that means. The easiest way to think of it is as the aerobic version of &#8220;regular&#8221; yoga (that&#8217;s &#8220;Hatha&#8221; yoga, in case you&#8217;re interested).<br />
The second thing is that yoga isn&#8217;t just standing (or sitting) in various poses. (Some yogas can be, but ashtanga definitely ain&#8217;t.) Each pose is for stretching, flexing, meditation, or a combination of all three. Especially with ashtanga, you&#8217;ll work up a good sweat, too. By the time you get to the end, you&#8217;ll either be dying for more, or thankful that it&#8217;s over for the day.<br />
And the third is a bit of an odd one: Breathing. Yeah, kind of an important one, I know. But it&#8217;s key to being able to ensure you&#8217;re getting not only enough oxygen to handle the workout, and block out the &#8220;discomfort&#8221; (as Lori puts it). The breathing manner is specific: Always through the nose, and using the ribs to breathe, not the belly (your abdominals should be contracted as much as possible). Inhaling, you try to make the sound &#8220;suh&#8221; (with your mouth closed, of course), while making the sound &#8220;ha&#8221; while exhaling.<br />
Sounds strange, I know. The reason is clear once you get into it, though. It&#8217;s not easy to do. In fact, when you&#8217;re in a particularly awkward pose &#8212; say, Paripurna Navasana (Full Boat Pose) &#8212; you can concentrate on getting your breathing correct and not so much on the fact that your legs feel like they&#8217;re about to rip your stomach muscles apart.<br />
Generally, each yoga session starts off with a series of three poses done in succession: Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), which moves into Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward-Facing Dog), then into Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog), which is held for up to two minutes at a time. This is to help get the body ready for the lesson it&#8217;s about to receive. It&#8217;s a bit of stretching, a bit of strength, and done just fast enough to get the blood flowing.<br />
After that, it&#8217;s up to the instructor to define their pattern of torture for the day.<br />
Day #1<br />
The rest of the class has done this before. Some of them are long-term veterans. I don&#8217;t have a clue what I&#8217;m doing. Lori&#8217;s kind enough to explain the breathing thing to me, since it makes no sense to me at first. She then suggests that I just try to concentrate on the breathing and not worry too much about getting the poses right.<br />
I spend a lot of time looking at her or others in the class, because I don&#8217;t understand a thing. Many of Lori&#8217;s words are in Sanskrit (the ancient Indian language used 5,000 years ago when yoga was first defined), and it&#8217;s traditional to use the Sanskrit words. I have no idea what &#8220;bondas&#8221; are, or what she&#8217;s saying when we&#8217;re supposed to &#8220;Svanasana&#8221;.<br />
At the end of the class, we assume a pose which is, well, laying down with eyes closed. It&#8217;s supposed to be for relaxation, but a few of us (not me) fall asleep. I find yoga, as experienced, a lot easier than I thought. So I gather, Lori took it light on us.<br />
Day #2<br />
This time, I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;ve got an idea of what yoga is, I sort of know the motions (well, some of them), and I&#8217;m prepared for the run. We do the opening, and then start trying a few new poses we didn&#8217;t do the week before. Some are easy, some are not. Lori also kicks it up a notch, and the class is bit harder than the first one. In general, I&#8217;m able to keep up.<br />
The breathing is difficult, and I often find myself remembering how I&#8217;m supposed to breathe. It helps me concentrate on something other than the severe wobbling on my legs in some of the poses. (The wobbling, incidentally, is partly due to the position that I&#8217;m in, and partly due to trying to keep my balance without falling over.)<br />
About halfway through the class, I realized I could get into full lotus pose. (Sitting down, it&#8217;s where your feet cross, heels near or touching the hips.) I haven&#8217;t done it in about two decades, but not for lack of trying &#8212; I just never thought to. I was quite amazed with myself, actually.<br />
I realize that the final pose is actually a pose, and not just us lying down. It&#8217;s called Savasana (Corpse Pose) and is designed as a relaxtion and meditative state. The idea is to calm the body and the mind after doing countless things to it. I think I&#8217;m going to start practicing this every night when I go to bed &#8212; I always want to fall asleep.<br />
Day #3<br />
I&#8217;m keen, but a little hesitant. Why? Well, the day before, I did a fairly strenuous leg workout at the gym. Lately, this hasn&#8217;t been too much of a problem, as the protein powder I now take seems to keep the recovery period extremely short. However, having missed most of last week to schedule and exhaustion, my legs took a little longer to heal up.<br />
Based on the previous class, I figured I&#8217;d have a good chance to stretch out my quadriceps (the troublesome muscles in question). What I didn&#8217;t figure on was Lori deciding to crank up the difficulty and really put us through our paces. And, I hope by complete coincidence, really focus on our legs.<br />
One particular pose she put us into, the name of which I don&#8217;t know, pretty much put me over the edge. Basically, you&#8217;re bend forward at the waist, feet hip-width apart and bent at the knees. Keeping the feet flat on the floor, you feed one arm between the legs, and the other wraps around your back, linking somewhere around your rear end. Normally, this isn&#8217;t a problem for me to do. However, the pain in my already-sore thighs was &#8230; exquisite.<br />
Ever felt like your quadriceps were going to physically separate from your femur?<br />
I had to drop out of the pose twice, especially after my left thigh started cramping. Not a good sign.<br />
We also did a pose that I found quite enjoyable. It goes like this: Sitting, bring your feet in as tight as you can to your groin. Then have the instructor stand on your knees while forcing your head down so that your forehead touches your toes.<br />
Now here&#8217;s the kicker: I liked it. (But then, I have a very flexible groin.)<br />
Another new position we was Bakasana (Crane Pose). It&#8217;s a bit of an odd one. You start with hands placed on the mat, shoulder-width apart, fingers spread widely. Then lean forward onto your arms, and place your knees just above the elbows, and roll forward until your feet come off the ground. Ideally, you&#8217;ll be standing on your hands, with (surprisingly) little stress on your wrist.<br />
It&#8217;s a hard position, partly due to upper body strength, but also due to balance. I was actually quite amazed that I could even get into it. Unfortunately, while my strength seemed to be agreeing, my balance wasn&#8217;t as cooperative. I muttered in my thoughts:<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; oh, crap &#8230;&#8221;<br />
Thump.<br />
Right on my head, too. I had laughed at my friend because she, while doing the same pose at her class, had landed on her face. She quite rightly returned the favour when I told her about my limited success.<br />
Then we moved onto headstands. I hadn&#8217;t done one since I was in high school. I need a little practice. Surprisingly enough, getting up wasn&#8217;t really that hard. It was staying there. I thought I&#8217;d had it balanced well. But when I felt my feet having gone past the point of no return, all I could was do a tuck and roll out of what would have been a complete collapse.<br />
By the end of the class, my legs were hamburger formed into two bulky bags that somehow supported my torso and allowed me to walk. Walking down the stairs was difficult. (Heck, walking on a horizontal surface was a bit of a challenge.) I fully expected to pay for it the following morning.<br />
But despite how badly I hurt, I woke up relatively pain-free this morning. Somehow, all the stretching cancelled out the muscle shredding, and I was able to move without a wheelchair. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next class on Tuesday, without a clue of what Lori is going to do to us next. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting set of classes, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to get a lot out of yoga.<br />
The only drawback? I feel like going into Savasana during meetings&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It seems that Critical Mass is losing too many good people within a very short period of time. First, it was a round of layoffs nearly three weeks ago. Now it&#8217;s a series of resignations. Among them is Arthur.<br />
Arthur came to Critical Mass about two months after I&#8217;d started. He&#8217;d moved into the interactive agency world after realizing that banking just wasn&#8217;t for him. He sat next to me in our old building. Starting off in QA, Arthur worked himself up to the point where he could switch into Web Development, where he did a variety of projects before landing on the Mercedes-Benz account.<br />
For at least two years, Arthur was the lead Web Developer on the Dealers projects, although last year he also ran the Web Development end of the Collection migration. In no case an easy job. He worked long hours when necessary, and never once complained about the job. Truly a model employee.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t work that defined him. It was being himself. He&#8217;s thoughtful, kind, caring, always willing to help, and will go out of his way to take on a challenge when he sees the opportunity. This is how Arthur came to be my coach and mentor for physical fitness. He&#8217;s the one who set me up with my program, changed my eating habits, and encouraged me to try different things and move ahead.<br />
And I wasn&#8217;t the only one who had seen this sort of thing in him. Many people at Critical Mass who have come to know Arthur over the last three and a half years would be sad to see him go. Which is why on Friday, we held a going-away party for him at Vicious Circle.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people showed up, but we&#8217;d pulled out well in excess of 50 people. We had three our four large tables at the club filled with folks. Well, all but one person in particular. Arthur was late. Somehow, I wasn&#8217;t particularly surprised that the guest of honour was running 45 minutes late.<br />
People came and went over the next few hours. Soon, we were down to a solitary table, harbouring Arthur, Angie, Pat, Colin, Reid, Jude, Rudy, John, and myself. Somewhere around midnight (I&#8217;m guessing), we opted to move to a different venue. So we were off in a few vehicles for what we call the No Name Lounge, a club near 17th Ave. and 14th St. that, quite literally, has no name. (It&#8217;s probably a numbered company for the purposes of liquor licenses, et al.)<br />
We&#8217;d been there once before for Rudy&#8217;s little send off before he&#8217;d vanished to the South Pacific for a month over Christmas. There were significantly more people inside this time around, but as was the case before, the music was stellar, and the venue loads of fun.<br />
Just after 1:30, we&#8217;d realized that we&#8217;d had enough for one night. Arthur, Rudy, and Jude had already vanished for the Cherry Lounge, but the rest of us were not to follow. Angie went home (Reid making sure she got there okay), while Pat, John, Colin, and I saddled up for the ride home.<br />
Dropping John off at his place, Pat, Colin, and I headed in search of sustinence. We were starving. A night of revelry and far too much beer for our own good (we were pretty much sober by this point, incidentally) brought us to the most popular eatery on 17th Ave. for those out partying: Wicked Wedge. A slice of a &#8220;Chief Wiggum&#8221; pizza and a small Coke did wonders for me &#8230; and probably not for my diet. (I was willing to make an exception.)<br />
Pat and I drove Colin up to his place in Rocky Ridge (pretty much most of the way to Cochrane), engaging in a bitch-fest the likes of which I haven&#8217;t been in for a very long time. The three of us are long-time Critical Mass veterans (except that Pat was laid off three weeks ago), so we&#8217;ve seen it all. Literally. And we know what&#8217;s good and what needs help.<br />
*Sigh* If only we ran things. (And while I&#8217;m dreaming about things I don&#8217;t really want, I&#8217;d like to be a famous movie star.)<br />
Pat dropped me off just after 3:00. The house was cold and dark. But I didn&#8217;t mind at all. I crawled into bed, curled up in a fetal position, and let the sleep of the wicked steal me away for a few hours. I just hope no-one else leaves anytime soon. I don&#8217;t think my body can take it.<br />
In a couple of weeks, Arthur leaves for Toronto. No more morning workout sessions. No more suggestions on how to improve. No more crack comments as he passes my desk. (Hmmm&#8230; suddenly, this isn&#8217;t looking like such a bad thing.) But such is life. You can&#8217;t get into a pattern for too long before something has to change.<br />
Take care, Arthur! I&#8217;m sure our paths will cross again.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hereby lodge as much a formal complaint to the final outcome of last night&#8217;s team building event as one can without a process by which to handle it. So I&#8217;m throwing it out on the Internet for all to see.<br />
But more on that in a minute &#8230; or five.<br />
This week, Critical Mass&#8217; first and still largest client, Mercedes-Benz USA, came up to the mind-numbingly cold Great White North of Calgary for Year 2004 planning meetings.<br />
Client meetings can go one of two ways: good, and horrible. I have the fortune, thus far, of never having had the latter. All of the client meetings have been good: productive, educational, if perhaps a little dry from time to time. But at the end of the day, you can walk off knowing that you&#8217;ve done a good job.<br />
I&#8217;ve been on the Mercedes account for over three years, now. Overall, it&#8217;s been a fairly good (albeit trying) experience. But in those three years, I hadn&#8217;t really met the client before. So walking onto the fourth floor, I ran into a lot of people I had never really met before.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s not entirely fair. I had &#8220;met&#8221; most of them during a previous visit, about this time last year (before I was promoted into the lead team). They came by on a tour, shook hands, I did a 30-second unprepared song and dance, they walked off. Now I had to remember their names and interact with them. (Not that is a bad thing in any way.)<br />
Wednesday was our first day of meetings. Eight o&#8217;clock in the morning until after five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. Straight. Wednesday night was the first event, which was a kind of cooking class. Can&#8217;t tell you anything about it, though. Wasn&#8217;t invited. (Although I&#8217;m a lead, apparently I&#8217;m not important enough to be considered for some things &#8230; the rel reason was due to too many people on the team, and that I don&#8217;t have direct contact with the client on a regular basis).<br />
The first activity of the day, though, was a team-building event. Basically, personality bingo. We had to go around the room and find things that people could do or have done (for example, who could drive stick shift or who had been to five countries).<br />
The next thing was a review of management types. We had all done a survey that produced our management strengths. The result is one of four &#8220;colours&#8221;: red (direct and to-the-point), green (extroverted), blue (planning), and yellow (structured). The idea is to focus on the strengths, and know how you communicate with other colours.<br />
I&#8217;m a blue, for the record. It&#8217;s characterized by taking time to get all the facts, understand the situation, and plan things out. Supposedly, one of the other characteristics is a long fuse (apparently, we can take a lot of crap); but when it burns out, run.<br />
At the time I saw that characteristic, I actually took a bit of offence. I used to be like that. Won&#8217;t deny it &#8212; can&#8217;t deny it. But I&#8217;ve taken great strides in keeping my temper in check. I would even go so far as to say that I&#8217;m a lot more laid back than I used to be.<br />
Thursday. Stories of the dinner the night before. More meetings. A little later of a start, but the same sort of results. The technology review got booted twice, and ultimately delayed until today (we&#8217;re just getting underway as I type this, and I wonder if we&#8217;ll be getting to it at all).<br />
The thing we looked forward to most, though, was the team event. This typically happens on the last night of a meetings. It&#8217;s always different, but almost always fun. I don&#8217;t know what they did last time, but a couple years ago they did the O-Lame-Pics, which was some combination of winter &#8220;sports&#8221;. This year was something different.<br />
At first, we were actually told we needed to bring snowpants. I have no idea why, but I can only guess there was something to do with, well, snow. (I know, took a real stretch of deduction.) That was changed when we were told that we would not be outdoors for more than seven minutes at a time. But we were not told what the event was. All we were told was to be in the Walker Room of the Hyatt hotel at 18:15.<br />
At about 18:30, the game was finally announced: The Amazing Freeze. Based on the reality show &#8220;The Amazing Race&#8221;, the idea was that we would run around downtown Calgary, doing various events and getting clues to the next event.<br />
Sounds pretty straight-forward, eh? Well, here&#8217;s something to really throw a wrench in your aspirations. We were &#8220;randomly&#8221; (I assume randomness, but have to really wonder) put into teams of 5-6 people. While most of the teams were a blend of Critical Mass and Mercedes-Benz USA employees. As was with mine. Except for one detail.<br />
Everyone else was from New York. I was the only one who had any idea of where these places were.<br />
The teams were named by model. We were Team SL500 (my favourite Benz, although I&#8217;ll never be able to afford one). There was Anne, our account manager in New York; Ed, who runs the Dealers program at Mercedes; Diane, who runs the Owners program at Mercedes; Lark, who is one of Mercedes IT&#8217;s representatives; and yours truly.<br />
We were handed knapsacks. In these knapsacks were bottles of water, a pad of paper, two taxi chits, a couple of pens, and an emergency phone number to call in the event you somehow got lost.<br />
As we had already been drinking when we were handed the bag, the logical thing to do was replace the bottles of water with bottles of beer and wine. (Hey, if you&#8217;re gonna run around downtown Calgary like maniacs, you might as well be loaded while doing it.)<br />
We then got our first clue. The entire group of about 25 people rushed out of the hotel en masse (I can only imagine what the other guests were thinking), dashing off to their first destinations. Three groups (including ours) ended up at the James Joyce. First challenge: sidle up to the bar, and suck back a few shots. Jim Beam. Blech.<br />
Next clue took us to the Calgary Tower. I started making the team run. I got caught up in the competition. This was a bit of a challenge, because Lark and Ed don&#8217;t run, Diane is a self-professed &#8220;lazy New Yorker&#8221;, and I had a little too much energy for my own good. We ran across red lights.<br />
A list of 10 questions, including the name of the building with a yellow plane in its lobby (the Petro-Canada Tower), the date Calgary became a city (1884), or what building was built for the 1983 Summer Games (the Lindsay Park facility, now known as the Talisman Centre, which had been the velodrome, I believe). Assuming you didn&#8217;t know the answers, you could find them by using four kiosks around the tower&#8217;s observation level.<br />
We ran a lot.<br />
Questions filled in, we caught the elevator back down. As we caught our breath, we had an Australian couple (I think they were Australian) take our team photo. In the spirit of the game, and because the shots had kicked in by that time, Lark offered the couple one of our bottles of beer.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen such a confused and bewildered look before in my life.<br />
Turning the question sheet over to the clerk at the desk (who had answered &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; when asked if he would help us with the question sheet), we received our next clue. It took a moment for me to figure out what it said (remember, the shots had kicked in), and we ran off to Winner&#8217;s to get a team &#8220;uniform&#8221; that could be purchased for CDN$60.<br />
The Winner&#8217;s staff were probably more confused than the couple in the elevator. All they knew was that there would be teams of people running through the store on some goofy quest. But first, we needed a team uniform. The team made a quick decision: socks. Really ugly ones. Ed was so enthusiastic, he ripped them from the racks, the little plastic clips flying everywhere. Ed ran back to the cashier, Diane apologising to the clerk for our haste.<br />
Right about then, Lark started telling the clerk (who was holding our clue envelopes) that she was with another team. Somehow, she got the CLK500 envelope. At this point, Diane and I got on the fairness bandwagon and decried Lark&#8217;s underhandedness, and made her hand it back.<br />
If we&#8217;d been thinking, we would have grabbed all the envelopes and scrambled the clues (they were all different). Oh well, lesson learned.<br />
Atrocious socks in hand, we were off to the Glenbow Museum. (Yes, running. Well, I was. The rest of the team, not so much.) We had a choice: either run through the Bog People exhibit (which I saw about a week and a half ago), or take the detour. The detour won, hands-down.<br />
The detour was simple, though: tie ourselves together with scarves, run out to Macleod Trail, and run back. The whole thing took about 30 seconds. We chanted like Marines as we jogged down the block and back. Next clue: Off to sushi.<br />
If there was one key mistake that we made, it was following the instructions and taking the C-Train. If we&#8217;d been thinking, we&#8217;d have taken a taxi. So we had to wait 10 minutes for a train to show up.<br />
But we sort of played the taxi angle. While the rest of us waited on the platform, Ed wandered out to the road to flag something down. He didn&#8217;t find a taxi, but managed to frighten some poor woman in a minivan (she locked her doors), tried to flag down one of Calgary Transit&#8217;s community busses, and almost stopped a police SUV.<br />
The train finally showed up, and we headed off to the 7th St. stop, at the other end of downtown. We were the last team to get to Sushi Hiro (but not because we were slow; that was just our last stop). We had to wait for the previous team to finish and leave.<br />
The game was a kind of fear factor: people had to eat sushi. Oh. My. Such fear. The longest part of the effort was laying claim to the sushi we wanted to eat. It disappeared in less time than we&#8217;d had to wait to eat it. (Lark pulled out the wine, and Ed cracked a beer &#8230; with his teeth, no less!) Back out the door, we started to flag down a cab, only to luck into having a cab be there, waiting. (It had been called by a previous team, and had been late arriving.) We were off to our final stop: Catch Restaurant.<br />
We didn&#8217;t use the taxi chits, Ed paid for the cab with cash. In the door, and up the stairs, we were the first team to arrive. We even had to find Eryn, who was more-or-less the ringleader of the whole event. The elation of being first, despite the odds that were against us, was outstanding.<br />
The rest of the teams started arriving. By the time we got back downstairs (we weren&#8217;t allowed upstairs yet, so had to wait in the Oyster Bar), the second team had arrived. It wasn&#8217;t long before most of the teams had finished, and we were allowed back upstairs.<br />
Tales from the teams&#8217; exploits were traded around. No-one had gotten lost, but we weren&#8217;t the only ones to make mistakes. One team actually walked to Sushi Hiro and back, which added a significant portion of time to their race.<br />
We sat down to dinner, which consisted of salad or clam and oyster chowder, haibut or beef, and a chocolate mousse cake. Very tasty.<br />
Awards for the teams were handed out, from last to first. Eryn added colour commentary, which was definitely playful. Everyone was having fun. At least until they announced the winner.<br />
A different team supposedly won. They weren&#8217;t even the second team to come through the door! I was dumbfounded! And it was because, of all things, because they&#8217;d had to wait for sushi, so they got a time bonus.<br />
Remember that long fuse? It burned out.<br />
Considering the difficulties our team faced, we should have been granted a lot more leniency. But no, somewhere a serious breech of the rules occured and the winning team didn&#8217;t actually win. To put it succinctly, we were robbed.<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m still steamed. We got a coffee mug. Much better than the little keychain light, teddy bear, or box of Smarties of the other teams (the &#8220;winning&#8221; team made off like kings), but it&#8217;s not the prize that&#8217;s at issue here! It&#8217;s the principle of the thing. We&#8217;d won, pure and simple. We followed the rules (despite Lark&#8217;s attempt at sabotage), and finished first. Why should we get penalized because another team had to wait for something out of their control?<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a game, Geoff, don&#8217;t take it so personally!&#8221;<br />
Yeah, yeah, I know. Considering all the things we had to, the excellent team building we had done, the &#8220;process&#8221; we&#8217;re supposed to be following (as a part of our jobs), and arriving first, all I wanted was to cheer our vistory. I couldn&#8217;t care less about winning anything. The fact that four Americans had to put their faith in a lone Canuck not to get them lost, come together as a team, and still complete the course before everyone else should garner the recognition. What else can I say? I got caught up in the competitivenes.<br />
Yeah, so this is my formal complaint. We won, darn it, and you can&#8217;t take that away from us. Take your fancy backpacks, I don&#8217;t care! (I have one, anyway.) I have the satisfaction that we are #1.<br />
Now before everyone thinks I&#8217;m too negative about all this, make no mistake: I had fun. A lot of fun. I would do it again in a second. It was planned wonderfully, executed brilliantly, and (outcome notwithstanding) an excellent idea for the event. I have to keep it in mind should I ever have to do this sort of thing again.<br />
But next time, I&#8217;m switching the envelopes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every year, Critical Mass holds its annual holiday party. For the first two years of my employ, they were Christmas parties (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]); the two since then have both been New Year parties (see [[Critical Mass New Year Party 2003]] photos). I assume this is because scheduling things before Christmas is far more difficult. And really, it&#8217;s nice to have party that&#8217;s not heavily influenced by a holiday.<br />
Last year, we hung out at the Destination: Africa pavillion at the Zoo. A neat place, to be sure, but you can&#8217;t go to the same place twice in a row (if at all). So this year (and last night, to be specific), we opted for something different. It was a little more downplayed than last year &#8212; the Palomino Room at the Roundup Centre. Not exactly the Fairmont Palliser, but the venue wasn&#8217;t going to be the central point.<br />
Kristen and I arrived just as the event was beginning. We could have gone for the slightly more fashionably-late, but considering there was a hockey game and the motorcycle show both on that evening (not to mention other parties), I wanted to take advantage of the nearby parking at the office. Thankfully, we were not the first to show.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the theme of the evening was, but the focal point was money. As each person arrived, they were given an envelope that contained the ubiquitous drink tickets, and $20,000 in funny money for each person. (Kristen and I had a total of $40,000 between the two of us.) The funny money was for use at the gaming tables.<br />
The Lions Club provided the entertainment &#8212; several blackjack tables, a roulette table, and two other games that I really don&#8217;t know the name of, but generally don&#8217;t see outside of carnival midways. The idea of these tables was to turn your $20,000 into much more. This money would be used after the tables closed to bid on a wide range of prizes, including a carpet steamer, camera, kid&#8217;s play easel, coffee maker, power saw, and a monstrous George Foreman grill.<br />
We mingled near the door, getting a feel for the near-empty room. James bounded up from out of nowhere, already quite giddy. He, Scott, and Tyler were providing the music that evening, taking turns DJing. (I would believe their task to be wholly successful, but in discussing the aftermath with James earlier today, found that there were those who were less than impressed. To them, I can only feel pity, for not appreciating that these gentlemen volunteered their time. They sacrified their party time so that the rest would not suffer the consequences of the DJ we had last year.)<br />
James proceeded to note my demure behaviour, which while I did not take offense in, could not understand how he noticed so quickly, having only just arrived. We were then taken for a quick tour to the stage to view the setup for the evening. Most of what James said registered somewhere in the recesses of my mind, but only superficially &#8212; he was talking so fast I could barely understand him.<br />
Amy and Jen arrived soon thereafter, so the four of us (James remained on stage) took Table 15. We would be accompanied by Angie and Tyler, and Luke and Allison. With our things &#8220;stashed&#8221;, we proceeded to find out if we were lucky in cards.<br />
Neither Kristen or I had played blackjack before. And we were at a table with a dealer whose accent, unfortunately, was difficult to hear at times (over the music and other people). But we began to get the basics down. The principle is easy enough (closest to 21 without going over, and it&#8217;s the dealer vs. everyone else). For a while, we were up and down like yo-yos, before Kristen hit a big winning streak, which recovered all our lost funds, plus $1,000 &#8230; which was the smallest bill, by the way, so don&#8217;t think we were *that* successful.<br />
Dinner was called around 6:30 or so, which was an excuse to hit the lines. Of our table, we were the last to arrive. But at least the food was good. (Terri had warned me that Stampede Catering was not the best, so we apparently had tried to get another caterer. But only Stampede Catering will cater an event on the Stampede grounds.) Roast vegetables, potatoes, chicken, and a wonderful roast beef (with a wild mushroom gravy that I thought was wonderful). Hard to eat everything, though. Especially since we needed to save room for dessert.<br />
And were we glad we did. Now the chocolate wasn&#8217;t Bernard Callebaut (at least, I don&#8217;t believe it was), but it was still very tasty. The shocker for the night, however, was the baklava. Until last night, I wasn&#8217;t really a baklava fan. I&#8217;d had it before, but it hadn&#8217;t done anything for me. Kristen, however, could not get over how good it was. So I had to try. I was beside myself.<br />
I love chocolate. I mean, I *really* love chocolate. It&#8217;s one of my weaknesses. But this simple Greek pastry was like having someone open the door into a new world of taste experiences. I think the main ingredient was pure crack cocaine, because it was enough for Kristen and I to go back for seconds, thus eliminating the remainder of baklava from the table. (Yes, we were greedy. So sue me.)<br />
Following dinner, the gaming tables resumed with frenzy. Kristen and I tried our hands again at 21, only to find that our luck wasn&#8217;t as good as we&#8217;d thought. Finally, Kristen convinced me to try roulette &#8212; something Tamara would have loved, had she been able to come. I&#8217;d never played it before, though I knew the rules from having watched Tamara and Adrian on a couple of occassions.<br />
Like blackjack, roulette does involve some strategy, and you can do quite well, depending on how you place bets. Placing directly on the numbers the most risky, but has the highest payoff. Playing on the variations (colours, odd/even, number ranges) tends to reduce the risk. It took me a while to listen to my instinct and hope that we did well.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how much we were down when we started (we&#8217;d both had our clocks cleaned at the last blackjack table), but in the last spin of the roulette table before it closed, earned back enough money to have the original $40,000 restored. I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Several others did much better, going into the hundreds of thousands. But even that would not be enough for the bidding wars that were about to break out.<br />
With the gaming complete, the silent auction went into overdrive. The first table closed 30 minutes after gaming ended, so the bidding was fierce. The top price was $325,000 for the carpet cleaner. I was impressed &#8212; I didn&#8217;t think anyone could win so much. It was then that it dawned on us &#8230; not all the winnings were from one person.<br />
Pooling had begun. Deals were struck, begging was in full force. Eyes were locked on certain items, and the bids were rising fast. It was like watching an episode of &#8220;Survivor&#8221;. Soon, it was just the second table. Minimum bid? Somewhere around $200,000. Rumours of someone walking around with $5 million began to spread. False values were thrown around like rice at a wedding. Our paltry $40,000 was donated to the cause, so Luke could acquire the coffee maker of his dreams.<br />
Oddly enough, it would be the coffee maker that acquired the most attention, though for reasons I may never fully understand. In the waning seconds of the bidding, the war went to extremes, with people turning over huge sums of cash to a select few still engaged in the fight. When the ball dropped and the bidding closed, the final values were unbelievable. The coffee maker drew the biggest bid of the night, almost doubling that of the professional-looking George Foreman grill.<br />
Final bid: $1 million.<br />
All I can say is, that had better be one damn fine cup of coffee.<br />
The wars over and the dust settled, there were a few announcements, and James began his run at the turntables. Some people stayed at danced, some headed out. We stuck around for about 45 minutes or so, before we, too, headed out. Normally, I would shut the party down. For once, I wasn&#8217;t really upset about leaving early.<br />
It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what they can plan for next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

		<blockquote><p>There were green alligators, and long necked geese,<br />
Some humpty-back camels and some chimpanzees,<br />
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as your born,<br />
The loveliest of all was the Unicorn.<br />
<cite>&#8212; &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;, The Irish Rovers</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>There are all sorts of smart things one can do on a school night. Getting drunk ain&#8217;t one of them.<br />
For those of you no longer in the scholastic world, a &#8220;school night&#8221; is no different than those you experienced at school. Basically, most weekday nights (not counting Friday) and Sunday night. So named because you have to get up early in the morning, file yourself off to a building, and concentrate on things that you might not otherwise like doing.<br />
For the last three days, I&#8217;ve been in all-day meetings. We&#8217;re planning out the 2004 projects for Mercedes-Benz. Now that I&#8217;m part of the lead team, I now participate in these meetings. They&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. We sort out all sorts of issues and really get a good feel for the direction we want to take the account.<br />
But they are draining.<br />
It&#8217;s like having a Martian Brain Sucker attached to your skull all day. By the end of it, you&#8217;re exhausted. The advantage is that you feel really good about the work you&#8217;ve done. All in in all, it&#8217;s a good experience.<br />
&#8216;Course, the best part is the dinner that follow the last day. That&#8217;s when the MB team goes out for dinner. Well, &#8220;dinner&#8221; is a subjective term, since we eat a little and drink a lot. (The amount of drinking varies, usually inversely proportionate to how smart you are about when to stop.) But it&#8217;s all fun.<br />
To make things more interesting, I didn&#8217;t leave right at the end of the day. You see, irony of ironies, the site that I worked on directly (and for which we were having the dinner), MBUSA.com, was down. It had been down since about 11:00 that morning. All because of a database edit. A fairly simple thing, really, which is why we were so utterly puzzled when the &#8220;fix&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.<br />
When 17:00 rolled around, the fixing was still at full speed. I got the skinny on what was going on (I only knew during the day that there was a problem, but not exactly what it was) and tried to understand what part of the problem was. (There was a lot of Java discussion, which I don&#8217;t possess enough of an understanding to truly grasp.) In a nutshell, there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to help.<br />
So I went out to get drunk.<br />
Well, that wasn&#8217;t so much the intention so much as the result. And lest ye be thinking I&#8217;m turning into a raging alcoholic, please rest your fears. Now I know there are a number of stories that always seem to start: &#8220;So we went out to get drunk&#8230;&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I don&#8217;t live my entire week like that &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have made it 31 years if I did. Just that the drinking stories are usually the most fun.<br />
The Wildwood Pub is one of the nicer places in town to meet. It used to be a lot better. Sadly, as I found out last night, their beer quality has begun to sink dramatically. Peter, our newest copywriter, was telling me to avoid the stuff. I should have listened. Between Peter and myself, we tried every variety of beer they had (there&#8217;s only six or seven of &#8217;em). They were all bad. We both switched to Keith&#8217;s.<br />
I think I ended up being the only technology person in attendance. (Most of the others, sadly, were trapped at the office trying to resolve the site problem. The fix, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was to restore a previous backup of the database.) So I guess I felt a responsibility to represent. [Insert cliched reference to LA gangland-style comrades here.]<br />
That might have been what possessed me to drink beer a little too quickly. Either way, a good time was had. So good, in fact, that eventually, it was down to just five people: Dan (the Managing Director &#8212; the Big Kahuna, if you will), Mabel (Dan&#8217;s assistant), Jason (Project Manager), Daryl (Account Manager), and yours truly. That was when Mabel convinced us that we had to go somewhere else.<br />
We retreated to two cars: Mabel&#8217;s and Dan&#8217;s. I rode in Dan&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d never been in a Mercedes-Benz before. (Hey, he *is* the Managing Director. He kind of has to own one.) It&#8217;s nice &#8230; the rear seats are brutally cold, but it is nice. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever own one, though.<br />
Mabel and Dan zig-zagged through Calgary. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I knew where they were going, but we eventually ended up at Mabel&#8217;s apartment, where she ditched her car. The five of us continued in Dan&#8217;s to our destination: Aussie Rules.<br />
Aussie Rules is an Australian bar. (Or at least, it&#8217;s supposed to be.) Now before you think that&#8217;s a little strange, here&#8217;s something else to make you scratch your head: It ain&#8217;t the only one in town. Yes, there is another one: The Flying Emu (okay, so technically, it should be a New Zealand bar), just down from my old apartment.<br />
So you think I&#8217;d see kangaroos, drink Foster&#8217;s, and eat barbecued shrimp, right? Nope. We listened to dueling pianos.<br />
Yes, dueling pianos. Perhaps one of the stranger things to see in a bar. Two pianos (baby grands), facing each other. Two player/singers. But it&#8217;s not a competition &#8212; they play together, banging out whatever songs people request (or whatever they feel like playing). Mabel led us to the table right in front of the stage so we could get the full effect.<br />
We came at an opportune time (which I can only assume was in the vicinity of midnight), as these guys had been playing (and drinking) for a couple of hours. They were definitely well into their silly stage. While they did play great music (they actually did a couple lines out of Gowan&#8217;s &#8220;A Criminal Mind&#8221; on a request I shouted out; they wouldn&#8217;t touch Gordon Lightfoot), they also did a pub favourite. This was Mabel&#8217;s request.<br />
At some point in your life, you&#8217;ve probably heard The Irish Rover&#8217;s &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;. If you listen to it the way the Rovers do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is a very nice song. If you listen to the way the Dueling Pianos do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is an Olympic event.<br />
When the request was made, one of the two pianists (a guy about 40 lbs overweight, I&#8217;d guess) climbed up on top of the piano (I assume it can easily handle the weight of someone on the lid), picked up a microphone, and hopped over to the top of the other piano, and prompted demanded everyone stand up.<br />
Incidentally, I assume they&#8217;ll only do this song after people have been drinking long enough.<br />
So here&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s all about a couple of the verses (here&#8217;s a link, <a href="http://www.irish-rovers.demon.co.uk/lyrics/unicorn.htm">in case you want to know what the lyrics actually are</a>), repeating the chorus often, making the audience mimic the animals mentioned in the chorus, and following the direction of the singer (for example, when he yells: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221;, you point at the bar). If you manage to get to the end with all the motions without laughing yourself to the floor, you&#8217;ve done pretty well.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it. But I didn&#8217;t land on the floor.<br />
Anyway, without going into excrutiating detail (&#8216;cuz you know I could), we had a blast at Aussie Rules. Before we knew it, there was the Last Call. At the time, it didn&#8217;t really click with me what the time probably was. For some reason, I decided that whatever time it was, it wasn&#8217;t really that late. It didn&#8217;t feel that late.<br />
Time flies when you&#8217;re drunk.<br />
We upped and left (paying the bill, of course) and headed towards downtown, dropping Mabel off along the way. Then it was over to the Mercury, another Calgary establishment. I have no idea what time it was when we arrived. It couldn&#8217;t have been too late &#8212; the place was still serving. Dan decided we needed some Irish Whisky to finish off the night.<br />
Dan drove us home. I live somewhat close to Dan, but saved him the trip through Sunnyside by having him drop me off at 2nd Ave and Centre St. From there, it&#8217;s a 20 minute walk home, which I really needed. It gave me enough fresh air to remember to drink a couple glasses of water and take a couple Tylenol to stave off the inevitable hangover.<br />
Tamara had been home barely 30 minutes before I walked in. She laughed. I was a wreck, and she knew it. (Technically, I knew it too, but just wasn&#8217;t willing to acknowledge it.) I had the water, pills, quick run through the bathroom, and crawled into bed somewhere around 3:00.<br />
Well, I assume I crawled into bed. I don&#8217;t really remember that step, but since I woke up in there, that&#8217;s about as close an assumption as I can make. My alarm &#8212; Chris&#8217; stereo which clicks on at 5:20 playing the Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; album (the entire thing &#8212; that&#8217;s over 45 minutes long) &#8212; didn&#8217;t wake me up. Not even remotely. I forgot to set my secondary alarm. Luckily, I have a backup.<br />
It&#8217;s furry, has four feet, and purrs. She also meows really loudly in the morning when she wants to be fed.<br />
At 7:37, I bolted out of bed in a bit of a panic, threw my head under the tap to get the bedhead down, dressed, shaved very quickly, ran a toothbrush across my teeth, and was in the process of about to run out the door when I realized Tamara was still asleep. We carpooled. I don&#8217;t drive to work usually, but considering we had to be at work for 8:00, I made an exception.<br />
The hangover kicked in around 8:30. And it got progressively worse all morning. The more I moved, the worse it got. Fortunately, nothing so serious that I was ready to &#8230; well, y&#8217;know, but I sucked back a few aspirin with ginger ale to try quieten the body. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a greasy lunch at A&amp;W that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Well, as normal as anyone can feel after mimicking a chimpanzee in a Australian bar in suburban Calgary at some ungodly hour of the night because I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for my own good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass is growing. We&#8217;re preparing for a (hoped) massive expansion, but also have organic growth to contend with.<br />
This is what led Critical Mass to have to hire a new Project Analyst. And luckily for me, it&#8217;s my friend Graham.<br />
You might remember Graham from a couple train chases, specifically my last hunt of 6060 (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]) and from the Inaugural Run of the CPR Empress (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It&#8217;s because of Graham&#8217;s ex-girlfriend that I met Graham while chasing 2816, because I looked a little lost. Since them, Graham and I have forged an interesting friendship, based mostly around trains.<br />
This means, of course, that I&#8217;m no longer the only train guy in the office. And some people here already know this. When Graham came for his first interview, Claude asked him about his hobbies, which included (of course) chasing trains. They asked if Graham knew me.<br />
Now this is where I got screwed. You see, Graham didn&#8217;t apply for this job because of me. I didn&#8217;t even know about it. Graham applied knowing that I work for Critical Mass. Because he wanted to get in on his own merit, he feined ignorance of me. If I&#8217;d had the chance to recommend him (and I would have), I could have received a $1,000 referral bonus.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Either way, it&#8217;s all good. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see Graham more than I have in the past (which isn&#8217;t that much), but with him on the fourth floor and me on the second, it&#8217;s hard to say how much our paths will cross.<br />
And we have to be a little cautious. If both of us ever called in sick at once, the immediate assumption would be that we&#8217;re chasing trains.</p>

		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

		<p>There are certainly worse ways to spend Friday the 13th. There are certainly more healthy ones. But when Critical Mass decides to throw a party for its employees, you can be sure of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lot of laughs.</li>
<li>There will be a lot of drunk people. (That kind of leads back to #1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I should point out, for the record, that the New Year party was extremely tame. I have no idea why specifically, but it was the first time I haven&#8217;t seen at least a few co-workers completely loaded.)<br />
Unlike last year&#8217;s little surprise (see [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]]), the staff knew that this party was coming. What they didn&#8217;t know was where it was going to be. There were many theories: Sylvan Lake, Calaway Park, Banff, even whitewater rafting. Most were discounted due to distance, cost, and safety. One location that had circulated a few times was COP &#8212; Canada Olympic Park. I assumed it would not be there, since I assumed (rather poorly) that there was little for us to do there. Little did I know&#8230;<br />
Our morning began a little earlier than usual. For me, it was with a little more responsibility &#8212; I had to take a staff photo. In the six years that Critical Mass has been in business, there has never been a staff photo. This was the first time since the Kelowna trip (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]) that we&#8217;ve had everyone in the same place at the same time.<br />
Since we laid six people off last week (including my roommate), we are without an &#8220;official&#8221; photographer. I guess I&#8217;m the next in line (can&#8217;t imagine why), so I was asked to take the picture. To allow this, Darrell (the VP of Operations) arranged for me to gain access to the roof of the next door building and shoot across the parking lot. Two great things about this: the angle is perfect, and the sun in the morning is great.<br />
The bad thing? Organizing that many staff is like herding cats. Which is why I was very happy to be just outside of comfortable shouting range.<br />
Pictures in hand, we boarded our busses for our unknown location (which we would soon find out was COP). We were grouped into five teams: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, White. (These are representative of the Olympic colours, of course.) This not only organizes us, but creates the groundwork for the competitive in-your-face attitudes that we generally lack in the office.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s a chance for us to completely mock each other.<br />
The line at the bar formed as soon as the busses arrived. It took less than a few minutes for us to be kicking back in the main tent, drinking our beverage of choice (usually one of Corona or Heineken), and getting into the groove of the day. Pat and I both remarked that in some ways, the day was reminicent of the Kelowna trip &#8212; starting the day off with beer.<br />
What I would find was that as the day went on, the more I felt like I was not in Calgary. The company had whisked us away to parts unknown to engage in a weekend of total debauchery. It wasn&#8217;t to the same scale as Kelowna (I&#8217;ll be very impressed if we ever see that again), but there was so much energy from having the entire day to do (pretty much) as we pleased that everyone seemed to forget that we were (at the core) just co-workers.<br />
We began our mini-Olympics around 10:00. The events were fairly simple, and none too difficult. (They were designed to be played by the dozen or so pregnant women currently at the office.) They included Bocce-Curling (get your ball the closest to the target), Cookie Stacking (stack Oreos as fast as you can in 30 seconds, using only one hand), Channelz (using five half-pipes, run a ball around an obstacle course, moving the ball from one channel to the next every 20 feet), Memory (remember what a bunch of articles are), and Balloon Toss (tossing a water balloon between two people, increasing the distance every throw).<br />
Oh, and there was one other event. As we arrived, 10 people volunteered for a &#8220;special event&#8221;. No-one knew what it was until it started: a Scavenger Hunt. A lot of people who didn&#8217;t volunteer wanted on, and a few who did volunteer wanted off. The details of the whole thing are still sketchy. We didn&#8217;t see the Hunters until just before lunch.<br />
Although I was part of Team Yellow, I spent most of my time running around between the various events, taking pictures. I gotta say: drinking beer and running don&#8217;t mix well at all.<br />
Participants were well-behaved. For about five minutes. I mean, come on! Put a bunch of people (mostly men, admittedly) in the vicinity of filled water balloons, and well, you&#8217;re gonna have some trouble. Suffice to say, every team that left the Balloon Toss went to their next event armed. It&#8217;s a good thing we had a sunny, warm day &#8212; a number of people got a wee bit damp. (Fortunately, our adolecently-minded staff had the decency not to aim water balloons at the women in white shirts.)<br />
Things calmed down a wee bit come lunchtime. That&#8217;s when everyone put their guns down and loaded up on food. (You&#8217;d be surprised how much acting like buffoons works up an appetite.) Nothing overly fancy &#8212; just hamburgers and salads.<br />
After lunch, we were left to our own devices. Some people went off wandering, some played mini-golf, and some went to play beach volleyball. The rest sat around and chatted. Resuming my photo run, I proceeded to find interesting things to take pictures of. For some reason, I started with beach volleyball.<br />
The five courts are wedged in the last curve of the bobsled/luge track. Unlike most of the other courts I&#8217;ve seen, these had more than the 2-3 inches that you end up driving your foot through into pavement. I took the opportunity to run around a bit and get a few action shots of people playing.<br />
My first memory card full, I took a moment to rest before heading back to get the second one. That&#8217;s when Ed suggested I come play with them. Still being inebriated enough not to know any better, I hopped out on the court.<br />
Now, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright idea on my part. My head (along with the rest of my body) was still swimming in ol&#8217; ethyl. The actions of volleyball &#8212; whipping the head around following the ball, diving, rolling, yelling &#8212; combine against your brain&#8217;s better judgement to stay in one place and lie down. Needless to say, it&#8217;s quite the argument my body got into.<br />
While in the midst of a set that I don&#8217;t really remember, I caught a glimpse of water balloons arcing over the trees. The angle required to get the balloons over the trees was so great that the balloons never came close to the courts. That didn&#8217;t stop me from annoucing (rather loudly) that if anyone hit my camera with one of those balloons, it would be the end of them.<br />
That statement would be my downfall.<br />
About 20 minutes later, Allard (my boss) caught us in between serves to borrow my little camera. Or rather, I thought that&#8217;s what he was looking for. In reality, he was checking to make sure I was camera-free. I hadn&#8217;t seen the audience on the hill carefully hiding my big camera.<br />
Next thing I know, there&#8217;s a line of people standing on the hill. They were in plain view. You know those old cowboy movies where the angry Indians all stand in a line at the top of a ridge? It was like that, only with water balloons. And no Indians.<br />
Somehow, instinctively, I knew to run. It didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; apparently, I&#8217;d earned the privilege of being the prime target. Two balloons bounced off me, but one made a direct hit in the front, followed moments later by one in the rear.<br />
Neil ran past. (Although he still claims his innocence, I have witnesses as to his involvement.) Picking up the two balloons, I chased him all over the courts. Then Neil got smart and stopped. Before I could do anything, he&#8217;d burst the balloon in my hand, and stepped on the other. Now balloon-less, there was only one other thing I could do: chase him.<br />
For all I know, I had a blood-curdling rebel yell as I chased Neil up the hill. Someone yelled out: &#8220;Tackle him! Go for the legs!&#8221; Remembering snippets of high school gym class, I dove and grabbed the legs. From what Arthur tells me, it was a textbook tackle. All I know is that the whole effort wore me out, and there&#8217;s no video evidence.<br />
I walked around damp for most of the afternoon (like I said, it&#8217;s a good thing it was warm), constantly shedding dried grass and sand from the escapade in the volleyball court. Although I can&#8217;t say I was the wettest that day, you could put me in the top rankings, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
The winners of the games were announced towards the end of the day. I wasn&#8217;t particularly paying attention, having reached what I can only assume was the bottom of my bottle, figuratively speaking. Team Green won, partly due to their skill (I can only assume) and subterfuge (which was widely known). Hey, it&#8217;s just a game&#8230;<br />
We returned to the office to begin the *second* event of the day. Thought we were over, didn&#8217;t you? Ha! If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s when to stop. Hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing&#8230;<br />
Vicious Circle was our next port of call. We didn&#8217;t all arrive at once, but before long a large portion of the company had packed themselves into a seat somewhere. And at Vicious Circle we sat, talked, drank, snacked, and took strange pictures of everyone who was there. And then suddenly, almost without warning, people began to filter out into the night.<br />
Torin, Adrian, Jim, and myself headed to Ceili&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not too sure why. We ran into a couple of people from CM, but after a quick search for anyone else in the building, we found outselves alone. This meant it was time to vacate. The problem, however, was that during our search, Jim decided it was time to get another beer. (For those of you who think *I* was far-gone, you needed to see Jim.) We didn&#8217;t much want to wait for Jim to finish his beer. No problem for him &#8212; he just slipped the 3/4-full pint into his pants pocket.<br />
Out the door and down Stephen Ave. &#8212; we were headed to SkyBar, where we knew the rest of the crew could be found. We didn&#8217;t get much further past Penny Lane when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: Sean, aka Muck, aka my cousin Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. Pam, of course, was right there. We talked briefly (the others were waiting for me, and I couldn&#8217;t very well wait around too long) before resuming our quest to SkyBar.<br />
When we reached 1st St., Jim disappeared. We were across the street from Murrietta&#8217;s, one of the cooler bars/clubs downtown. That night, they had a live band playing p-funk (basically, horn-driven music). Jim blurted something about it, and next thing we knew, he was gone. We waited around a couple of minutes, but Jim was gone. (James and I would discuss this the next day &#8212; James received two completely unintelligable voicemails from Jim over the course of the night.)<br />
Torin, Adrian, and I continued to SkyBar. There we ran into Cyndy, Ashifa, a couple of Marks, and other people I don&#8217;t quite remember now. SkyBar cover was $15. We weren&#8217;t objected to it so much as we were STARVING. Conveniently enough, Saltlik was next door. On the order for a late-night snack: a peppercorn steak.<br />
It was midnight when we hit the streets again. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, had at least that many beers over the course of the day, been water-bombed, run ragged, and my feet suddenly decided to tell me they were ready for revolt. As much as I would have liked to go up to SkyBar, my body cried out in defeat. It was time to go home.<br />
The lights were off, and nobody was home. (Except the cats, of course.) I assumed Tamara was out having her own breed of fun that night. For some reason, though, I felt the urge to look for a note. I found one on my computer keyboard: &#8220;Back in a few days. Enjoy your weekend!&#8221; I laughed, though probably more from being too tired. I crawled into bed next to Spaz, who was rather upset that I was making her move.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait for next year!<br />
