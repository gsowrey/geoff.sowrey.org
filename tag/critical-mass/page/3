	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not quite five and a half years ago, [[Moving into Critical Mass&#8217; New Building|Critical Mass moved into our current building]]. It was a monumental exercise that required a lot of forethought, planning, and organization. When we moved into the then-new building, we separated into our departments: Project Management (along with Reporting and some account services) on the first floor, Technology (and internal support) on the second floor, Creative on the third floor, with Administration (and some executives) on the fourth floor. Dewi and the Bistro were in the basement.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much how it was from the moment we got in the building. We&#8217;ve moved around a bit within the floors (I changed seats three times, landing in the same desk space twice), but generally kept the department separation.<br />
That was until a couple of weeks ago, when the Leadership Team (which, apparently, I&#8217;m loosely attached to now) called a meeting to announce the next great move. My first thought was that we were going to move buildings again. We know we&#8217;re running low on available space in this building. We need more people all the time, and are running out of places to put them. Sooner or later, we&#8217;re going to have to lay siege to one of the surrounding buildings and take the space for our own. Personally, I&#8217;m all for buying up the self storage building on the next block and installing a connecting walkway.<br />
But this wasn&#8217;t about running out of space. Well, not directly, anyway. This was Phase 1 of making more effective use of our space. And the first step was to do something that many of us veterans have talked about for years: reorganizing the floors so the project teams sit together. I was a little surprised to hear this, as I honestly thought that the idea had been so thoroughly squashed as to not even render a single drop of whine. We were outlined the almost laughably short timeline under which it would take place, and that no-one would officially know until the week before it took place.<br />
(The irony was that most people already knew &#8212; even before I was told, so I gather. It was one rumour I hadn&#8217;t heard before hearing official notice.)<br />
The trickiest part was that we had to sort out the seating plans so administration could rearrange phones and network connections. (The sad part is most people around here seem to only grudgingly acknowledge the Herculean tasks that Administration regularly pulls off without anyone noticing.) &#8220;Tricky&#8221; because most people had their own thoughts of where they wanted to sit. The task of setting the seating plan, however, would be left to the team leads, to minimize the inevitable cacophony over who was sitting where.<br />
Originally, my business unit was to stay on the second floor. Fine for me, as I&#8217;ve been there for years. Creative, however, wasn&#8217;t so keen on that. As a result of discussions with Misch and Jason, we figured out a plan that would work &#8230; and would give me one of the choicest seats on the floor. (I can rationalize nearly anything. Especially when I can get something good out of it.)<br />
Lest you think I purposely positioned myself to get the best seat, here&#8217;s the reality: I wanted to merge our team members, putting PM next to developer next to designer. In my oh-so-educated [insert sarcasm here] view, it was the best way to try and get projects running, by letting people learn from each other across disciplines and departments. That&#8217;s what I wanted &#8230; but I knew it was going to be a hard sell. Mostly because I&#8217;m the only one who wanted it. So we grouped by department, and the most convenient grouping happened to put the Technology group into the southwest corner. Looking at the desk plan, it just made sense to put me in the corner.<br />
Then we had a business unit rearrangement. Dell&#8217;s been getting bigger and bigger, and finally (like Mercedes-Benz and Rolex before it) be ejected into its own business unit. But it wasn&#8217;t just as simple as moving an account. It meant people had to be moved to handle the movement of the other accounts. It meant the Rolex team had to move &#8212; we were bumped to the third floor. And we had to make a very quick replanning to handle the team&#8217;s movement up one floor. As it stands, we more-or-less moved straight up one floor. And due to fortunate happenstance, I managed to snag the corner desk again. Two windows. Goregous view (compared to what I used to have, anyway). And way too much space.<br />
When we left on Friday, everything packed up and labelled, I questioned whether or not this move would go truly smoothly. My key concern was for things like the side tables. They&#8217;re hot property around the office, and as soon as one becomes available it&#8217;s snapped up. Sure enough, when I arrived on Monday, it was clear that monkey business had ensued in the hours before I arrived. I have no idea exactly what happened, but I sure heard about it.<br />
The other thing I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to hear about is the extra space I&#8217;ve ended up with. There&#8217;s a good desk&#8217;s worth of space between my desk and Jim and Scott&#8217;s. Someone&#8217;s gonna complain about that, I know. Personally, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having someone else in there. It&#8217;s too open. I just don&#8217;t know who would want that space. Frankly, I&#8217;m amazed Jason let me have it. He claimed it was a concession for us having to come to the third floor. Like moving into the best floor of the building is a concession into itself.<br />
Overall, the move is a good thing (irrespective of my desk location). I think it&#8217;ll help the teams work better, even if it means departments suffer a bit as a result. But since our end product is work for our clients, not for ourselves, I think it&#8217;ll go to help the movement. But like many things, only time will tell.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember a young whipper-snapper starting at Critical Mass nigh-six years ago. Another newbie, Angie, had mentioned that she&#8217;d brought his stuff out from Winnepeg. Not that I was far off from being a newbie myself &#8212; it had only been a couple of months since I had started.<br />
Since then, Dennis grew from being a quiet little kid to being the single strongest Senior Web Developer we have &#8230; or probably ever had. Dennis and I sat across from each other when we moved to the new building over five years ago. For a year or so, we would chat with each other over ICQ, rarely actually saying anything to one another. We&#8217;d work late almost every night. And we&#8217;d engage in endless debates about technology and management.<br />
Dennis could always code me under the table. He was a better developer, no two ways about it. He scared me back then. I had mastered the ins and outs of developing for Netscape 4 &#8212; a true pain in the arse to support. And the browser equivalent of the evolutionary dead end. Dennis was already well into DOM-compliant development, and object-oriented constructs. He could code a regular expression in his head &#8212; something I can barely do in a regular expression-capable application reading a dummy&#8217;s guide. Despite his age (he was the youngest person at Critical Mass for about three years running), he developed as fast (or faster) than anyone else and kept his own.<br />
A lot of people around here had the impression that I hated Dennis. I have to admit, I have no idea where that came from. Sure, Dennis did pick me off with an eraser once while I was on the phone, but I was just pissed off that someone had done that while I was on the phone! How did they know it wasn&#8217;t a client? In reality, I had &#8212; and still have &#8212; nothing but the highest respect for Dennis. He ran a team easily twice the size of the one I had with seeming ease, and kept everyone running smoothly. Dennis gets higher praise from his team under pressure than I did managing a team under considerably less strain.<br />
I&#8217;m going to miss that devious smirk of his. You&#8217;ll know it when you see it. Dennis is outspoken when he has a particular point of view. He&#8217;s mostly patient, but when he wants to say something, you&#8217;ll see it. He tries not to immediately jump in, but will eventually force his way in. And he doesn&#8217;t come unprepared.<br />
Tabs vs. Spaces. The single largest and most religious of the debates in programming. Which do you use when writing code? The Senior group finally had it out over a month ago. I brought beer to ease the inevitable pain. There wasn&#8217;t nearly as much yelling as I expected. Dennis had his argument for tabs nailed down. I figured he was going to win even before we started &#8212; he&#8217;d prepared himself for <em>months</em>.<br />
Last Friday was Dennis&#8217; &#8220;going away&#8221; binge. A lot of us went to the Ship (and Anchor) to commiserate with our loss. A few of us got into a heated &#8230; no, actually, just drunkenly loud discussion about the past, present, and future of Critical Mass. Those of us who&#8217;ve been around long enough to see the changes (for better or for worse), and speculate on what will be. I do know this much &#8212; you can&#8217;t go home. You can&#8217;t go back to the way things used to be. Times change, and you have to accept that the people you&#8217;ve known and the friends you&#8217;ve made will eventually go the route they need to, even if it is away from yourself.<br />
Dennis was the #3 guy for Web Dev seniority. Now the #3 falls to Torin, who&#8217;s a year and a half behind me. That gap scares me a little bit. That&#8217;s a long gap between seniority. Mind you, we did have some questionable folks in that gap, and there&#8217;s been a long time for them to filter out. But still, it&#8217;s a little worrisome. Mostly because then the next question is: have I overstayed my welcome? It is not a case of there being a gap &#8230; but me staying too long in one place?<br />
D-Money is gone, off to (assumedly) greener pastures. I&#8217;m gonna miss him, too. I miss a lot of people it seems, and a lot more often than I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;ve written too many entries on people leaving. Inevitable or not for our industry, I still don&#8217;t like when it happens.<br />
Take care, Dennis &#8212; keep shaking things up!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>James on Monday. Rudy on Friday. I can&#8217;t make any &#8220;Rudy Tuesday&#8221; jokes on this one, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
Rudy was only the second Web Developer that we hired after moving into our current building (I can&#8217;t say &#8220;new&#8221; building, &#8216;cuz it ain&#8217;t new anymore). And that was almost a year after we picked up Carl.<br />
Rudy was one of our workhorses. Give him a task, and let him loose. Didn&#8217;t matter how much time he needed to put into it, didn&#8217;t matter what the estimate was. He got it done, and it was done when it was promised. A quality that is not only admirable, but hard to come across. And it no doubt hurt Rudy&#8217;s social life, at least to some degree.<br />
I never once heard Rudy complain over the years. Admittedly, I&#8217;m not sure complaining is even in Rudy&#8217;s nature. A couple of years ago, Rudy was in a fairly nasty motorbike accident, basically screwing up his legs for a month or two. But even when he struggled in for Jude&#8217;s farewell (see [[So long, Jude!]]) on crutches, he was still all smiles and laughs. I suppose that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to miss most about Rudy.<br />
Rudy was one of the popular crowd, something I never was. Never been a popular person in general, really. I&#8217;m Joe Average. I have my ups and down, but when it comes to the end of the day, I don&#8217;t stand out, make waves, attract, or repel. In a group of two, I&#8217;m the one you won&#8217;t see. I wasn&#8217;t part of the 5% &#8212; even if I was included in a couple of events &#8212; and generally only find out about things after they happen.<br />
That sort of thing really used to bother me a lot, being left out. I was never sure of it was a conscious thing: &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t call Geoff &#8212; we don&#8217;t want him around here!&#8221;. Or was it just merely that I&#8217;m forgotten? Hard to say which is worse &#8212; exclusion or insignificance. They both pretty nasty. It&#8217;s also hard on the ego, being left out like that. It really makes you think about the friends that you have (or don&#8217;t have), and how people ultimately view you.<br />
I&#8217;ve come to accept that I&#8217;m generally not liked. (Hopefully, it doesn&#8217;t extend to me being outright hated.) At best, I&#8217;m tolerated. I can&#8217;t trace the thousand steps it took me to get where I am. It&#8217;s those thousand steps &#8212; or thousand cuts? &#8212; that slowly wore away at any appeal that I did have (and probably some of the credibility, too). I might get the job done, but generally I&#8217;m just a bastard. An ass. Maybe it&#8217;s my own self-importance speaking to me, I&#8217;m not sure. But I know that people treat me differently now than they used to even a couple of years ago. And I feel alone.<br />
With Rudy&#8217;s departure, isolation sinks in more and more.<br />
Rudy was supposed to be my major project this year. Despite being at Critical Mass about three and a half years, he never made it to Senior. I felt he was ready, just that we needed to push him a little more. It was all minor stuff, too. And that the opportunity we had planned for him on the Michelin projects didn&#8217;t come through the way we&#8217;d planned. In many ways, I feel like I failed him.<br />
There&#8217;s almost none of the old guard left. After Dennis, it&#8217;s about a year and a half before you get to Torin, the next most senior web developer we have. I talk to those who&#8217;ve gone to &#8220;greener pastures&#8221;, and I wonder what it would be like out there. In a little over two weeks, I complete my sixth year here at Critical Mass. I&#8217;ve come a long way &#8230; but at what cost? Maybe I&#8217;ve become too complacent? Have I been responsible for too many people leaving? Am I even competant in my job anymore?<br />
I ask myself questions like this more and more. I do what I think is right, but is it? Maybe Rudy&#8217;s got the right idea &#8212; get out while you can and do something else. Work someplace different. Reground yourself before it&#8217;s too late. And maybe I am where I&#8217;m supposed to be. Maybe I&#8217;m already in the only place I can be. Oh, the questions&#8230;<br />
Good luck, Rudy. We&#8217;re gonna miss you &#8217;round the farm. Wherever you land, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be good.</p>

		<p>Another one bites the dust.<br />
I hate it when friends leave, even if it&#8217;s just to go to another company in the city. And with James&#8217; departure, it hits a little more. Not just because I saw a lot of my older self in him, not just because he was one of our Sr. developers, or even just because he single-handedly put an end to reply-alls in the building for a long time.<br />
It&#8217;s probably because this place will be a lot quieter without him.<br />
I still remember when James started. He was a young, brash, loud, and potentially brilliant developer. Which meant that certain people on the team immediately hated him. Why? Because James rocked the boat by refusing to fall in line. Unlike those of us who chose to go against doctrine in a more passive manner, James was much more vocal. Where others use subtlety, James used subterfuge. When others whispered, James cracked a whip.<br />
Very early on, James single-handedly took on the issue of people replying to companywide emails with trivial points, often engaging everyone in a conversation that no-one truly cared about. James&#8217; approach? The most effective weapon in his arsenal: comedic, sometimes outright mocking images. They did an exceedingly good job at putting replies to an end. James&#8217; first image was beautifully simple: a small boy, praying at the side of a bed (presumably before he went to sleep). The caption read: &#8220;Please God, make it stop.&#8221;<br />
James&#8217; second reply was to a CEO&#8217;s email. I suggested that he might want to back off until he at least passed his probationary period.<br />
I saw a lot of myself in James, only amplified a few times. The brashness of youth, the self-realization of brillance, the demands of excellence. James has yet to reach the age I was when I started (though he is close now), and I wonder if he will mellow over the years in the way I have calmed down. (Those of you who knew me as a teenager/early 20-something will no doubt find that hard to believe.)<br />
I had hoped we could hang onto James, but after three-ish years it&#8217;s hard to hang onto veterans. That&#8217;s the nature of our industry &#8212; a couple years here, a couple years there, and the process goes on. The loss of experience and knowledge is often hard to deal with. It hurts every time we lose a long-term employee. We&#8217;ve seen this loss many times over, and we&#8217;ll see it again and again &#8212; the nature of our business.<br />
Amy. Luke. Adam. Mark. Dave. Jaime. Christine. Andrew. Jude. Scott. Angie. Pat. Carl. Rich. Vlad. Neil. Tamara. Bill. Myles. Damon. Ed. Cory. Jules. Reid. Darren. Nancy. Rob. Jen. Graham. Dave (a different one). And that&#8217;sonly just those I can easily remember. I missed recording most of the departures over the last year due to my blogging inactivity. (There&#8217;s a thousand reasons for that, none of which have any real validity when it comes down to the fact that I just didn&#8217;t do what I should have been doing.) So for all of you who have left who wonder where your farewell is &#8230; I can only apologize.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not blaming anyone for this. Ours is a hard industry, and it&#8217;s hard to stay here for long without the desire to move on. That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that the pressures of the job don&#8217;t get to you first. Client demands are often a hard thing, and they can wear you down. Even in the lower echelons, where client contact rarely happens, the trickle-down effect can be quite pronounced.<br />
I suppose after a while you become immune to the pressure. Or you find a way of dealing with it. Or you go insane. Heck, there&#8217;s really only four options, and if you don&#8217;t decide to move on, you succumb to each of the other three over time &#8230; though the order in which each of them gets you is different from person to person. I think I&#8217;ve almost reached the &#8220;immune&#8221; stage. Or at least, I hope I&#8217;ve almost reached it.<br />
So James is gone. Unlike Scott or Jude, though, he&#8217;s still in town. So it&#8217;s not so bad. And Mike has returned after his effective exile of about four years ago. Rudy&#8217;s going soon, so that&#8217;s something else to contend with.<br />
Times they are a changin&#8217;. For better or for worse, that&#8217;s how life goes. It sucks when friends aren&#8217;t as readily accessible as they were before, but at least &#8212; if nothing else &#8212; the internet does make communication significantly easier.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass works hard. We know that from all the various nervous ticks we&#8217;ve developed over the years from working too hard.<br />
So you can imagine that when we play, we make up for the difference.<br />
There are two annual events in the Critical Mass calendar. The first is the Summer Event, which has been a staple since I started back in 2000. The other, a more recent edition, is the CMMYs (pronounced &#8220;see-emmies&#8221;). It&#8217;s our own internal awards show, showcasing the work we&#8217;ve done over the last year. It&#8217;s a combination of the Emmys, the Oscars, the MTV Movie Awards, and a car crash. Namely, that it runs longer than you think, but you just can&#8217;t stop watching it.<br />
During CMMY week, Critical Mass is a madhouse. Mostly because we import all of our offices to Calgary and still try to function. The Calgary office surprisingly can still accomodate all those people &#8212; well over 300 of them &#8212; and not have to share desks. Meeting rooms, on the other hand, are in much shorter supply. And that&#8217;s a problem when meetings become a priority because everyone&#8217;s here. And because it&#8217;s a prime time for 2006 planning.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m glad that this week is nearly over &#8212; the meetings have been murder, and I&#8217;ve not gotten nearly enough done. Next week, things will return to normal. I hope.<br />
The events of this week have been varied, but interesting. People started arriving Monday morning from the Toronto office &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t expecting people until Tuesday at the earliest. The Bistro was quite full at breakfast. Faces I&#8217;d not seen in quite some time (partly due to me leaving the Mercedes-Benz account) were a happy sight. And a lot of faces that I&#8217;ve never seen before.<br />
I used to pride myself on knowing everyone in the company. But there are just too many of them now. I think I&#8217;ll be lucky to know even half of Critical Mass. Half of that number I might know personally. It might be a small world, but there are lot of people in it.<br />
Tuesday was the Town Hall and Department meetings. The winter Town Hall is often &#8230; well, dull. Not because it&#8217;s all financial and organizational material. Not <em>just</em> because. It&#8217;s mostly because it&#8217;s not played up as much as the summer Town Hall, which has been the source of some absolute hilarity at the complete expense of anything business-related. So the winter session is a little harder to sit through.<br />
The Department meeting was also a little hard to sit through, despite the lubrication of having beer readily available. The major issue was how the Technology department will work at Critical Mass. We&#8217;ve reorganized a bit, and we&#8217;re now part of the Strategy group. This, I like. I like the idea that Planning will come before Design, and that Technology is a part of that planning. The trouble is, that&#8217;s not the way that Critical Mass has worked in the past &#8212; Technology has historically come after the Design phase.<br />
It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re objected to change, only that we don&#8217;t understand yet how it will all work. But that&#8217;s the thing &#8212; no-one has spelled it out in detail. And no-one will &#8212; you can&#8217;t, there&#8217;s just too many things to state to make it an effective piece of communication. But it&#8217;s the direction that matters, and it&#8217;s something we need to pay closer attention to. Agility and strategic positioning is what it&#8217;s all about.<br />
Wednesday was all about meetings of various kinds. Two of particular importance to me, however, were the Web Development meetings. First was a meeting of the Senior web developers. This is the steering group, the ones who set the best practices in the company, and guide the rest of the team in our daily work. For the last few weeks, we&#8217;ve been establishing our own internal standards. We&#8217;ve had the standards embedded in our culture for a long time, but never actually written down. Now that we have more than one production office, we need to get our act together.<br />
The topic of this meeting? It was important to have this specific meeting, given that all of our seniors were in the same place (except Colin, who got sucked away to a client visit in California). This was the sort of discussion that required everyone present. It&#8217;s a religious debate amongst developers, one that widely divides camps, and creates shouting matches. (Which is also why I bought beer, so we could keep it somewhat calm.)<br />
Tabs vs. spaces.<br />
For those of you in the programming field, you know what I mean. For those of you who have no idea what the big deal is, well, it&#8217;s hard to explain the passion that abounded about which standard we would use. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care. Or I didn&#8217;t until that meeting. As the arguments went along, I fell into line with Dennis&#8217; well-crafted argument to use tabs. Torin&#8217;s defence of spaces never really quite caught on for me, though it was also well-handled. Tabs won out.<br />
The next meeting was not as successful as I would have liked: the Web Dev Bru Ha Ha. Every so often, we try to get the entire Web Dev team out for a drink after work. It&#8217;s a chance to mingle and get to know one another. But despite having the entire team in the city, we got barely half of the team out. Sadly, or fortunately (depending on your view), it just means we&#8217;ll have to keep trying until we get it right.<br />
Thursday, yesterday, was the big day. Everyone was anticipating the big night. And we knew from the start that this was going to be something interesting, when spying the Brokeback Mountain poster taped to one of the meeting room walls &#8230; and then realizing that it said &#8220;Brettback Evan&#8221; and featured the faces of two of our IT wizards, Brett and Evan in place of Heath and Jake.<br />
One final meeting was the BU meeting &#8212; the Business Unit that we belong to. Our BUs are colour-coded, and contain one or more accounts depending on their size. Until a week or so ago, I was part of the Orange BU. That was until we found out that our newest client &#8212; for whom I&#8217;m the Technology Director &#8212; was a lot larger than we&#8217;d thought. Now I&#8217;m in the Gold BU. We&#8217;re still small, but we&#8217;ll be growing this year. But due to our compact size, we could easily squeeze into the upper floor of the Rose and Crown. We were back at the office just before 17:00 to get ready for the CMMYs.<br />
The CMMYs are a time for Critical Mass to play it up a bit. It&#8217;s also a time for us to look more presentable than usual. In fact, there&#8217;s even a dress code: No jeans, no running shoes, no hats. That&#8217;s it, so it leaves a lot of options open &#8212; no matter what your sense of taste is. Last year, it brought out guys in the stereotypically gaudy 1970&#8217;s powder blue tuxedos complete with the ruffled shirts. It&#8217;s a chance for Jerry, our Chairman, to break out his very dapper tuxedo. It&#8217;s a chance for people to dress up in ways they normally wouldn&#8217;t, and enjoy the change.<br />
Deciding that I&#8217;ve worn my wedding suit too often (it&#8217;s becoming a pattern), I opted for something a little different. I wore my kilt.<br />
Actually, it was my dad&#8217;s kilt. Custom-made in Scotland. It&#8217;s a heavy little bugger, but it looks great. The last time I&#8217;d worn it was at Cathy&#8217;s wedding. Back then, I didn&#8217;t like the kilt so much. It&#8217;s a winter-weight kilt, which means you bake in the middle of the summer. I was also a few pounds heavier, meaning I barely fit in it.<br />
I&#8217;m thinner now (thanks to Arthur), so wearing it isn&#8217;t such a burden. And being winter, it&#8217;s more comfortable. Well, almost. It figures that the first actual cold day since winter began in Calgary is the day I&#8217;m going to not wear pants. It was -35 with the wind chill.<br />
We all arrived at the Calgary Hyatt for 18:00 &#8212; the start of cocktail time. When Neil spotted me walking into the coat check area, he spied my hairy legs poking out from under my Morrison dress tartan, and immediately declared: &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna know.&#8221;<br />
He was referring, of course, to the oft-mentioned fact: what do Scotsmen wear beneath the kilt? You&#8217;d be surprised how often I was asked that question. But only one person dared check: John. The sheep-shagging haggis stuffer was the only one bold enough to continue hauling it up. I don&#8217;t think he ever got a good look, thankfully! John and I have a long history, though &#8212; he was my account manager on my first project. I met him for the first time when I&#8217;d had to be sent down to Cincinnati to fix a problem on another project (see [[Live from Cincinnati]]).<br />
Dinner was served promptly at 19:00 &#8230; I think. I&#8217;d officially lost track of time by then. I was at the back of the room with my fellow technical cohorts, most of them Flash developers. The rest were web developers. I felt like the old fart at the table, and not just the fact that I&#8217;m older than the rest of them. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass nearly six years &#8212; only Natalia came close to my tenure. I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass long enough to be able to remember the events coming up on the projection screen.<br />
(Incidentally, to the Critical Mass historian: the first town hall that took place at the Danish Community Centre followed by a visit to Ceili&#8217;s took place in 2000, not 1999 as it appeared. I know &#8212; I was there. I have witnesses to that effect.)<br />
Dinner was surprisingly good. I was worried that our meals would be &#8230; not terribly satisfying due to the banquet-style serving. But the Hyatt did an outstanding job of my steak. Certainly something worth praising, I think.<br />
Following dinner, we began the awards show. Every year, we strive to have someone worthy of being on stage, someone who can captivate the audience, while simultaneously being able to offer witty, sometimes slanderous quips. Who else but the beautiful Arif?<br />
The awards go for most risky project, ones with the most changes before it was complete, best integration, and so forth. Mixed in between the awards were short clips of video promoting our CMVPs, one of whom would be chosen as CMVP of the year. It&#8217;s a big honour &#8230; and a big cheque. I&#8217;d filmed some stuff for Torin&#8217;s segment. The best part was seeing how the video was edited into it&#8217;s final form. Quotes were intentionally taken out of reference, things spliced in such a way as to tell a story that no one person could tell.<br />
Also thrown in were two other special events. The first was a tribute to Jerry, our new Chairman of the Board. Jerry used to be the CEO, but we had a restructuring this year that put Jerry to the head of the heap. I&#8217;ve gotten to know Jerry a bit over the years, though I know most of my knowledge is courtesy of stories told by others. Though Jerry does tell a number of good ones, himself.<br />
The second was a tribute to employee #001. It was introduced by Darren, who believed himself to be #001. As the story goes, though, he found out that he wasn&#8217;t in fact #001. So he renumbered himself to #000. The one bearing #001 is Randy &#8212; our first financial wizard. Randy doesn&#8217;t say much, but he certainly did this time. And Randy didn&#8217;t allow himself to stay alone, asking up the other original few who are still with Critical Mass. It was time to celebrate one more thing:<br />
iPods.<br />
No, wait, sorry &#8212; that was afterwards. It was to celebrate 10 Years of Critical Mass. Ten years ago, Ted Hellard and Michel Clairo started a little CD-ROM firm. Today, we&#8217;re the top interactive agency in North America. A few people working out of a living room turned into a seven-office marketing demon with over 300 employees. I&#8217;ve been here over half of its life, and I think I&#8217;m going to be here for a long time to come &#8230; I hope.<br />
As a present to everyone who had helped Critical Mass get to where we are, everyone was given a gift: iPods. 30GB versions to the permanent employees, Shuffles to the term employees. I&#8217;ve already got a Nano, so this was icing on the cake. On the back is an inscription: &#8220;CRITICAL MASS Ten years and counting&#8221;.<br />
Brett won for CMVP of the year &#8212; deservedly so. The presentation was accompanied by the trailer for Brettback Evan, a parody of Brokeback Mountain. Every year, every meeting like this, someone creates a classic Critical Mass video. This was the CMMYs&#8217; contribution to posterity. It joins the class of &#8220;Arif Striptease&#8221;, &#8220;Dirty J&#8221;, &#8220;Luke&#8217;s Workout&#8221;, and &#8220;The Office Enforcer&#8221;. One day, I&#8217;ll need to get a DVD of all of these.<br />
We never all made it to Ducky&#8217;s. That had been the plan. But in typical awards fashion, we didn&#8217;t wrap up the show until nearly midnight. By then, it was clear we were better off staying at the Hyatt. I held out until about 2:00 before finally weaving my way home. I&#8217;m not able to handle the drive as well as I used to &#8212; I must be getting old.<br />
This morning was a little rough. My head hurt. Tylenol, an extra-cheesy omelette, a -25 degree walk to the bus stop to get to work (I left my car at the office so I wouldn&#8217;t drive home), and four mugs of jasmine tea corrected the queasiness.<br />
My throat hurts, and my voice is a good octave lower. That&#8217;s mostly due to yelling. As anyone who&#8217;s been around me after two beers and in a noisy environment knows, my ability to control the volume of my voice goes right out the window. I&#8217;m sure I deafened Ryan when I was encouraging him to be passionate about something he wants to do.<br />
Gary showed up at work in the same clothes as last night. He doesn&#8217;t fully remember everything. He wasn&#8217;t even sure if he took pictures (he did) or what happened to his jacket. People are calling in sick. Those here aren&#8217;t moving with the same vigour as usual. Pictures from last night look &#8230; interesting.<br />
God, I love this company.<br />

		<p>Some companies, those that want to be &#8220;fun&#8221; companies, sometimes give their staff things like shirts, bags, water jugs, and various other bits of paraphernalia emblazoned with the company logo.<br />
A couple of years ago, Critical Mass gave us sling bags, in either blue or yellow, with the Critical Mass logo on the back. Some people thought they were kinda dorky. Me? I&#8217;m loving this thing!<br />
<a href=""><br />
<img width="300" alt="Critical Mass on the Great Wall of China" src="http://www.howtogetlost.com/media/DSC03633.JPG" /><br />
</a><br />
I don&#8217;t know who specifically chose this bag style, but I&#8217;ll assume it was someone like Cyndy. This bag has been lugged most of the way around the world now, acting as my day pack. It&#8217;s been on the Great Wall. It&#8217;s been through the Hermitage. It&#8217;s seen the deserts of Mongolia. And it&#8217;s been rained on a couple of times (including a nice, semi-tropical downpour) and kept my stuff dry!<br />
So far, the only problem has been the stitching falling apart on the Velcro for the side flap. Nothing 30 minutes with a sewing kit can&#8217;t fix.<br />
Did I mention that I love this bag?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Five years ago, I walked in the doors of Critical Mass, having basically no idea what I was about to get myself into.<br />
At the time, I wasn&#8217;t planning on being at Critical Mass that long. Chris and I had planned on going to Japan to teach English. (Only Chris ever made it there.) Somehow, I thought I&#8217;d stick around.<br />
Until this job, I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d be at a company for more than two years. The longest job I&#8217;d been at was two years and one month, and that seemed like a long time.<br />
Yesterday marked the end of my fifth year here, and today the beginning of my sixth. I don&#8217;t see any immediate end to my career here, and only an interesting future ahead of me.<br />
Why am I still here after all this time? Why haven&#8217;t I moved on to greener pastures? One primary reason: there aren&#8217;t many pastures greener than here, and in Calgary, those pastures are exceedingly rare. There&#8217;s a lot of opportunity for me at Critical Mass, and I find that I&#8217;d be hard-pressed to do better elsewhere.<br />
Besides, as something many people have noted over the years, it&#8217;s the people. The people who work here are what makes Critical Mass such a great place to work. I don&#8217;t have mere co-workers, I have friends. They&#8217;re not just colleagues, they&#8217;re partners-in-crime.<br />
What can I say? The last five years have been a lot of fun. I&#8217;m curious to see what the next five years hold.</p>

		<p>For the last two nights, Critical Mass has run what are effectively recruiting job fairs over at the Roundup Centre.<br />
They&#8217;re weird things. We&#8217;d done them before when we were recruiting for a planned move to Toronto (which sadly didn&#8217;t come to fruition, only because the potential client ended up staying with their incumbent agency). I didn&#8217;t do the Toronto sessions, but I&#8217;d heard they were both a great success and utter mayhem.<br />

		<p>Yesterday was tough. We did a lot of talking. We didn&#8217;t leave the building until we were done. The three of us, Lark, and Jim went for dinner at some steak house. Despite having been out with the client before, I felt oddly nervous. I don&#8217;t know why. Maybe because this was nothing to do with marketing, it&#8217;s all about technology. It&#8217;s weird. And exhausting.<br />
I ate along this morning, as Allard and Mark took their time to get downstairs. We took another car to Mercedes&#8217; New Jersey office and prepared for another day of talking. Most of today would be my thing, namely my current baby, the CSR (Client-Side Rewrite). It&#8217;s a massive overhaul to strip out the legacy crap and put in something more solid to keep things moving.<br />

		<p>Leaving Alex this morning wasn&#8217;t easy. Given the events of the last couple of days, I would have preferred to stay in bed with her.<br />
But business calls, and I&#8217;m off to New York (though Newark) for business meetings with the IT department of our Mercedes client. It&#8217;s mostly an educational exchange, as we try pass on a lot of the knowledge we have to the IT group. Exactly <em>why</em> we&#8217;re doing this I&#8217;m admittedly a little unclear on, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s all for a good reason.<br />

		<p>Despite having the room to myself, I was really groggy when I got up this morning. I know it wasn&#8217;t a result of last night, though, as I didn&#8217;t feel any worse for wear. I showered, packed, and checked out (using the television interface &#8212; I don&#8217;t go to the front desk unless I have to). Running into Jamie on the way down, the two of us hiked directly over to the Tribune building. We didn&#8217;t get a chance to go to the office for email.<br />

		<p>Allard and I hit the restaurant in the main atrium for breakfast, joined shortly thereafter by Christian and a very tired-looking Jules. Powdered eggs aren&#8217;t exactly the breakfast of champions. Jules has been up late working on presentations for today. Allard and I are thankfully exempt from any actual presentations. We&#8217;re more or less along for the ride.<br />
Actually, me more than Allard. Allard, at least, is the Technical Director. He needs to be there because the client knows who he is. He needs to be there because some of MBIT will be there. Why do *I* need to be there? Well, I can&#8217;t say for sure, because I really don&#8217;t know, but I think it comes down to the Client-Side Rearchitecture project that I&#8217;m spearheading, and that Allard won&#8217;t be here tomorrow (he&#8217;s only here for a day).<br />

		<p>I hate waking up before 6:00. There&#8217;s just something fundamentally wrong with it. Today, though, it was necessary. Today, I fly to Chicago.<br />
Was ready for my 6:30 pickup. Allard was collecting me for the trip to the airport. I wasn&#8217;t sure if he was going to show up on time, since we&#8217;d had no actual solid confirmation of the pickup. At 6:25, I started formulating a backup plan, in the event that Allard was running a little late. His car appeared in front of my house at 6:30, right on the nose, saving me additional grief.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We had 2005 planning meetings this week, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. They can be quite painful, if for no reason other than for going over projects all day. It really wears on the brain, and the body. Well, my body, anyway. I have to drink Coke to focus well, since these meetings have a tendency to cause my brain to tune out. At the end of Wednesday, I was exhausted. It also didn&#8217;t help that I was having to stay late to catch up on work I was unable to do during the day.<br />
But as is typical with these annual meetings, we usually have an annual team building event. There were no green alligators or long-necked geese this year (see [[2003 planning meeting wrap party]]), which I&#8217;m partially thankful for. (That had been a lot of fun, but I felt quite hungover the next day &#8230; not that today is going all that swimmingly, I might add.)<br />
Following the end of our work day, those of us on the Mercedes-Benz USA account high-tailed it over to Eau Claire Market and the Cinescape, an arcade/lounge attached to the Cineplex Odeon theatre. We didn&#8217;t know exactly what was in store for us, especially since Scott, Torin, and I were the first to arrive.<br />
Somehow, though, we stuck out like a giraffe in a penguin parade, and a very helpful server by the name of Nigel came to our rescue. We had two pool tables, a series of tables, and an unlimited bar tab at our disposal, with food coming along shortly thereafter.<br />
Let the party begin.<br />
By 18:00, most of those who would be attending had arrived. Although the team numbers about 60, maybe only 2/3 of them showed up. While we waited for dinner, we played pool (I got smoked by Torin and Casey, who are both pool sharks) and chatted amongst ourselves. Some of the designers played darts (which, after Luke&#8217;s going away party &#8212; see [[Luke leaves Critical Mass]] &#8212; I had decided I was going to avoid).<br />
Dinner was quite good &#8212; much better than I had expected. Salads, buns, mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and chicken or salmon (or both, if you prefered). It tasted great, even standing up. While we ate, the rules of the game were explained&#8230;<br />
Each of us were given $1,000 in Monopoly money (photocopied, mind you) and 40 game tokens. The idea was to bet each other on games and try win as much money as possible. We were divided into teams, and the team with the most money at the end won the bragging rights. (As it stands, it&#8217;s up for debate which team ultimately ended up winning, no doubt in part to the quantities of alcohol consumed.)<br />
Not being a betting man, myself (I follow the wise words of Jack Burton: When the earth quakes, the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake, just look that big old storm right in the eye and say, &#8220;Give me your best shot. I can take it!&#8221; &#8230; no wait, wrong quote &#8230; I never bet my money, only my life). I pocketed the whole wad in my back pocket and played dumb the rest of the evening.<br />
For those of you who know me, I can play dumb real well.<br />
I finally beat Adrian in a game of air hockey. It&#8217;s taken a while. It was a hard-fought game, with both of us sending the puck in multiple directions off the table. The score came down to 7-6. It would be the last time I choose to challenge Adrian last night. (I would take Scott later on, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly who won &#8230; it was probably him.) I jumped in and out of games throughout the night, until all my tokens (including a healthy refill from Dan) were depleted. My trigger finger hurt.<br />
Talking and boasting continued until the lounge closed, and we all headed over to the Barley Mill to continue. Now, true believers, this is where things get a tad hazy, because I&#8217;m not entirely sure how long we were there for. I do remember one beer and playing a game where you try to guess what three words have in common (quite a good game, I might add). But that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t think we were there very long before we all upped and headed for Chinese.<br />
We lost two along the way, but Dan was still leading the charge. We ended up at Me and U, on the corner of 3rd Ave. and Centre Street. I&#8217;d never been there before, but it seemed like fun. Or would have. You see, as soon as I sat down and had my first cup of tea, my body started to rebel. I went to the bathroom and stood over the sink for about 10 minutes before Dan came to find me. I&#8217;d officially had the buscuit, and headed home.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what happened. I honestly don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d had that much. Maybe I did, and just don&#8217;t remember. Either way, though, the walk home wasn&#8217;t pleasant. I wasn&#8217;t sick, just really dizzy. It wasn&#8217;t like any enbriated state I&#8217;d experienced. Mind you, my memory was a little off, so it wasn&#8217;t easy to tell.<br />
Speaking of memory, mine was so shot that I didn&#8217;t wake up until 8:30, thanks to Tamara making noise in the bathroom. Crap. I hauled ass and was out of the house in less than 10 minutes, arriving at work just over an hour late. I depleted the Bistro&#8217;s supply of ginger ale. Ate several slices of banana bread. But it wasn&#8217;t until the greasy A&amp;W lunch that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Thank god we only do this once a year&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A couple of weeks ago, we received a note in our inboxes that Thelton McMillan, the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) had left Critical Mass. Needless to say, this had come as a bit of a shock to the staff, who had not expected something like this to happen.<br />
The reasons for the departure were a bit nebulous, since we weren&#8217;t entirely sure what was truth and what was made up to soften the blow. The official story was that Thelton had done what he was hired to do (restructure Critical Mass into a professionally-managed organization; we were previously more fly by the seat of our pants), and had run out of challenges. Not able to extend himself further, he felt it was time to move on.<br />
To a large extend, Thelton will be missed. Good leadership is hard to find, and that he was, despite his initial introduction to Critical Mass.<br />
When I returned to Critical Mass after my stint with the CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train (see [[Home for a rest]]), Thelton had come on to replace Di during her maternity leave. The Friday of that week, I got my first formal introduction &#8230; when he went on a massive rant about Critical Mass&#8217;s value system, respect, and responsibilities.<br />
He almost instigated a mass exodus. In the span of a few minutes, Thelton pretty much managed to piss of the department with the worst morale in the company. He never apologized for what he said, nor should he have. There was a new wind blowing at Critical Mass, and we were just figuring out what it was.<br />
Over the course of a few months, Thelton turned that relationship around. It took a lot of trust (and to be sure, there were those who never did fully trust him), but the results that came around as a result of his initiatives were undeniable. Politics within the departments aside, the transition went pretty well. (As some of you know, I had pretty major issues with how the transition went within Technology.)<br />
So tonight, many of us came out to bid Thelton a proper farewell. (Especially those of us who have benefitted greatly at his generousity when buying rounds of drinks at various Critical Mass events.)<br />
Departing from Critical Mass shortly after 17:00, Scott and I drove down to 15th Ave. and 5th St. SW, about a block from Bungalow (the lounge formally known as Pongo, since redesigned and reopened), which was our destination. There, we found John, one of our DBAs, trying to find the bar.<br />
Only a handful of people had arrived. The group had doubled 20 minutes later, and double again 20 minutes after that. Thelton and Christy arrived about 15 minutes after we did. Scott had to leave about 18:00; I had to leave before 18:30. It could have easily ended up being a major bender (had I not had existing plans, no doubt I would have hung around to the bitter end). Instead, I had a chat with Thelton and Garth, getting a feel for Thelton&#8217;s plans.<br />
I bid adieu to Thelton as I headed out to my car. I don&#8217;t know when our paths will cross again. I only hope that they will.<br />
Picking up Alex from home, we headed out to Banff (Bamf!). The entire Tisdale clan (extended or otherwise) along with friends were gathering. Tomorrow is Pam&#8217;s wedding.<br />
The drive out was filled with conversation, but after a long day, I was happy to get there and get ourselves squared away. Too bad that ended up being more difficult than it should have been.<br />
It appears the staff at the Banff Park Lodge are a little on the dense side. Aunt Brenda had booked four rooms: one for Brenda, Mike, and Jen; one for Cathy and Craig; one for Mom and Nana; and one for Alex and myself. We were the last to arrive, but there were no rooms left under Brenda&#8217;s name. Two were gone, and the remaining two had been switched to Cathy and Mom.<br />
I piled back into the car to run out and find Cathy and Craig at the St. James Gate, an Irish pub about two blocks away, where everyone was meeting starting at 20:00. We had passed C&amp;C on the way over, so I knew they&#8217;d be there.<br />
Alex&#8217;s introduction to C&amp;C was on the sidewalk outside the pub in the cold weather. Not exactly an ideal situation, but you can&#8217;t always control everything. Cathy was certain that we were in room 105.<br />
The four of us returned to the hotel, Cathy going to retrieve Aunt Brenda. As the story boiled out, Uncle Mike (who had arrived earlier) checked in at the front desk, and was assigned to #105, despite his wife being in #104. He&#8217;d even dumped his things in the room.<br />
Keys in hand, bags in room, car parked underground, and introductions more or less complete, Cathy, Craig, Alex, Mom, Brenda, and I all headed over to the pub. The room in the back was already fairly full, but we managed to squish into a table.<br />
We had a couple of drinks, chatted a while (Mom and Brenda left after about a half an hour), until just after 22:00, when Alex and I decided to head off in the direction of the Hot Springs. (There was another minor reason that was the initiator, but it&#8217;s not particularly relevant.) Jen came with us. It was raining a bit as we drove up, chatting with one another. I dropped Jen and Alex off at the building and went to park the car. They were waiting for me when we arrived. Despite Jen being a couple inches taller than me, she still qualifies as a child.<br />
I was the first out of the change room. The pool was empty. For a moment, I thought it might be closed. But it turns out, on what seems to be an uber-rare event, there was no-one else in the pool. The springs didn&#8217;t close until 23:00, and it being only about 22:25 or so, the pool was all mine.<br />
Well, for about two minutes, which is when Alex joined me, followed a couple minutes later by Jen. For about 10 minutes, the pool was all ours. We were then joined by a pair of women, who stayed primarily at the cooler end of the pool. We went from the hotter section to laying in the &#8220;children&#8217;s&#8221; area and back. I finally bailed about 23:50, when nausea began to set in. Top sign you&#8217;ve been in too long&#8230;<br />
The evening was much more comfortable with the benefits that come from relaxing in that pool. I almost wish I lived in Banff so I could buy and annual pass, and go to the pool whenever I liked. Such as it is, I can&#8217;t.<br />
Maybe this means I need a hottub&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s something about driving like a maniac that makes for an interesting afternoon.<br />
I&#8217;ve been working on the Mercedes-Benz USA account for over four years now. In all that time, the closest I&#8217;ve ever come to a Benz are the ones I see driving down the street, or the ones we caught in the 2004 Calgary Auto Show.<br />
That is, until today.<br />
Exactly how this was worked out, I&#8217;m not sure, and I&#8217;m not one to pry. All I know is that it was not only well worth my time, but it was a heap of fun. Through an announcement we received from Thelton (likely arranged through Dan, who was on vacation until today), we found that Critical Mass had arranged to attend one of Mercedes-Benz Canada&#8217;s Ride and Drive events. This would give us first-hand exposure to the products we market.<br />
First, though, we had to go through a product seminar. Or at least that&#8217;s what we were told it would be. As it turned out, the presentation had become an episode of &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221;. The team was broken into five teams, each with a speaker. The speaker was to answer the question (or question the answer, in this particular case).<br />
In some cases, the questions were correct, and points awarded. In my team&#8217;s case, represented by Jason, they were not. Christine was kind enough to tally our final score at about -$10,000.<br />
Immediately following the &#8220;seminar&#8221;, we headed to our own personal vehicles (or other&#8217;s if we were getting a lift, which I was), and headed towards the southeast to Race City Speedway.<br />
The event was to start at 14:00, at least according to the website. It was already underway when we arrived around 13:30, although you wouldn&#8217;t necessarily know &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of people there.<br />
Race City Speedway is on the bare outskirts of Calgary. It&#8217;s been there for decades, and it shows. It&#8217;s not the most glamourous place: the main parking lot is ratty gravel, the dirt oval looks like it hadn&#8217;t seen a spot of paint in at least 10 years, the timing tower&#8217;s seen a couple of improvements probably in recent times, though iffy, and the bleachers &#8230; well, you won&#8217;t catch me sitting on them any time soon.<br />
That said, the Speedway has a quarter-mile track for drag racing, and a small course for road racing. It was where the quarter mile track starts that Mercedes had set up the entry tent. There we received our tags, denoting us as participants in the event. Exiting the tent, we found the collected inventories of the Hyatt and Lonestar Mercedes-Benz dealerships neatly lined up for viewing. (One of the salesmen would later tell me that Murphy arranged to have their dealerships swamped with customers on the two days the cars weren&#8217;t there).<br />
We were ferried down from the cars to the first of the three event pieces. We were either driven in an ML350 or an S500. I opted for the S500, since I have no interest in the M-Class. The S-Class is a nice line, though I know I have no hope of ever affording one.<br />
The Ride and Drive event is put on by Mercedes-Benz Canada as a sales gimmick. The idea is to go beyond the ordinary test drive, to get a chance to push the car to do the things you wouldn&#8217;t get a chance to do in a normal test drive. The event is actually run by a completely different company, though.<br />
There are three activities at the Ride and Drive: the slalom, the C55 challenge, and braking and handling. This was the order I did them in, too, though I initially had no peticular desire to go near the C55. Details on that in a moment&#8230;<br />
The slalom is a fairly simple thing. The course is a loop, about 250 metres long, and about 15 metres wide. You drive down one side, at a fairly brisk pace, getting to know what the car is like in sharp corners. The course then turns around to return the way you came, with a jog to the left, then back to the right, and a stop sign just before the start/finish line.<br />
Jen, our Product Specialist (she ran the &#8220;Jeopardy&#8221; game), and I piled into a C230 Kompressor for the slalom. Jen took the first run, whipping in and out of the pylons that marked the edges of the curves, before whipping around the end, and bursting to the stop sign. We reached the end quite quickly, and we swapped. I don&#8217;t know how fast Jen did the course, but I think I ran it at about 50 km/h. I only hit one pylon. Others in our team were not quite so lucky, both Mabel and Jeff got lectures from the officials about their driving.<br />
I have to say that I have changed my opinion of the C230 Kompressor. I built the microsite for the Mercedes-Benz USA launch a few years ago. I came to loathe and despise the vehicle. I didn&#8217;t want anything to do with it. I actually tried to avoid driving it, opting for the C230 Sport Sedan instead. But somehow, it worked out that I got a chance to experience a car that, until today, I hated. Funny how things happen.<br />
As we watched others running the course, Robb finished his run in the C55, proclaiming:<br />
&#8220;You guys have gotta try this!&#8221;<br />
The C55 activity wasn&#8217;t really &#8220;active&#8221;. The C55 is the top of the line in the C-Class line, running about CDN$75,000 base. It&#8217;s an AMG, which is Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s custom sport line. It&#8217;s powerful, about 360 horsepower. It&#8217;s not the sort of thing that Mercedes-Benz is going to willingly let us drive. So they brought in a professional race car driver.<br />
Jen, Marcie, and I donned crash helmets and piled into the C55, Marcie in the front passenger seat, myself behind Marcie, and Jen next to me. The driver smirked through his visor, and the car took off, probably due to the massive ACME rockets strapped to the sides. (Well, okay, it felt like it.)<br />
The course isn&#8217;t long, maybe a kilometre in total length. Of course, pulling corners at 160 kilometres an hour eats up track very quickly. The locks on the seatbelts kicked in almost immediately, and stayed engaged until we got to the end.<br />
The driver didn&#8217;t hit the brake once. Marcie cried: &#8220;Ohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygodohmygod&#8221; as we rounded the corners, hanging on to whatever would keep us in our seats. The driver asked if we wanted to slow down. There was a doubly-defiant &#8220;NO!&#8221; from the backseat. Marcie was relieved when the ride was finally over.<br />
The next activity, just down the way from the C55 was hands-on: braking and handling. The task is fairly simple: drive as fast as possible towards a tight, short s-curve to the right, taking the turn while braking. Then come around for a straight-away run back in the direction we came in, running at full speed towards a stop sign, braking to the point where the ABS has to kick in. The idea, of course, is to find out what the cars handle like under the conditions.<br />
We had the choice of a C230 Sports Sedan, the S600, an ML350, and an E500. When I found out that the C230 had a manual transmission, I couldn&#8217;t resist the chance to give it a whirl. Scott (from our Research and Analytics group) hopped in the passenger seat.<br />
The clutch and the shift was a bit &#8220;squishy&#8221; (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that), but I got up to about 100 km/h before reaching the corner. It wasn&#8217;t easy to see (I wasn&#8217;t the only one to note that, either), and the car handled the braking and turning quite well &#8212; far better than I had expected.<br />
The return run was almost too much fun. Having (more or less) figured out the clutch&#8217;s sweet spot, I accelerated to over 120 km/h before I got to the stop. I popped the gear to neutral, and tried to put the brake through the floorboard. Nary a squeal from the tires, and the car came to a very quick halt.<br />
I would do the run again in an E500, but only as a passenger. It was a noticeable difference, mostly in that the E500 doesn&#8217;t handle as well. It is a bigger engine, but it&#8217;s also a bigger car.<br />
The smell of burning rubber was everywhere. If it wasn&#8217;t us smoking the tires on the slalom course (we regularly did &#8230; though I don&#8217;t believe *I* did), it was us squealing on the braking and handling course. Naturally, the C55 did have a bit of residual afterburn from the hard driving.<br />
We even managed to set off the brake overheat alarm on the E500.<br />
I have to say, I was duly impressed by the Mercedes-Benz lineup that we got to try. I somehow doubt that I&#8217;ll ever own one, mostly because I simply don&#8217;t get paid enough for one. (Besides, I do like my Mini.) What did I get out of all this today, then? A better appreciation for them, which is something you simply can&#8217;t get looking at pictures.<br />
Afterwards, we all headed over to one of the local pubs (Duck and Firkin, Fox and Gherkin, Bob and Merklin &#8230; something like that) for a few rounds. It gave us all a chance to recount our specific tales of automotive achievement, and ridicule each other about the dumb things we did.<br />
&#8216;Cuz hey, if you can&#8217;t mock your co-workers, what other reason do you have for working?<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, My Favourite Giant left Critical Mass. And we are lessened by his departure.<br />
Luke Puxley started at Critical Mass not quite two years ago. He was a daunting figure, mostly due to his sheer size. Luke is not a small man, though he never played the &#8220;big man&#8221; role. He was simply a larger version of EveryMan. He was kind, funny, helpful, thoughtful, intelligent, and hard-working.<br />
And he liked to goof off just as much as the rest of us. Maybe moreso.<br />
Luke was &#8220;My Favourite Giant&#8221; to some of us, &#8220;The Giant&#8221; to others, &#8220;Sir Bonks-A-Lot&#8221; to a precious few, but was as much a Critical Masser as the rest of us. He will be forever immortalized in a sketch prepared for our summer Town Hall (see [[Critical Mass Summer Town Hall and Kananaskis Cowpunch]]), most notably for his portrayal of a hard-working, sweat, big guy. (Come to think of it, some of us are still haunted by those images&#8230;)<br />
So it was simply natural that we have to make a final burst for Luke as he heads his way to an MBA. Yesterday, Mark arranged for a lunch at the Drum and Monkey, which I couldn&#8217;t attend due to an interview I had to conduct. (For the record, I don&#8217;t much like the Drum and Monkey for lunch, anyway. Too much food, and the service is lousy.) We would make a go of the usual run of things: Vicious Circle and sushi afterwards.<br />
Late because of a long-running conference call, I arrived at VC shortly after 17:40. Festivities were already well underway. Although we didn&#8217;t have a massive gathering, there were at least 25 people in attendance. Not shabby for someone who&#8217;d been mired on the Mercedes account for three-quarters of his employ.<br />
Friday afternoon was sunny and warm, and sitting on the patio of VC was something we all could enjoy. It wasn&#8217;t long before the Critical Mass team dominated the east side of the patio. We could have packed in more people, but were snubbed by Steve and Jana, and later by Thelton and Christie (though they had a better excuse &#8212; anniversaries do tend to take precendence).<br />
As afternoon turned into early evening, attendees started to drop off. The call for sushi went out, but acquired only a handful of takers: Scott, Linday, Luke, Reid, and yours truly. When minimal mass (the opposite of critical mass &#8212; when a sufficiently small number requires the dissolution of a particular state) was finally attained, the five of us headed over to the Sumo Lounge in Eau Claire Market (convenient for Luke, Lindsay, and myself, since we all live within walking distance).<br />
We had a booth to ourselves, thankfully away from everyone else. Why thankfully? Because we were loud.<br />
Okay, <em>I</em> was loud.<br />
One litre of sake between the five of us. Luke eventually cut himself off (it was a bit much for him). Peter Kinjo, the owner and Chief Troublemaker, made a point to come around and spread his unique brand of cheer. No dancing for Luke in a rubber wig and kimono, though &#8212; I suspect they wouldn&#8217;t have fit him, anyway.<br />
Departing Sumo, all of us but Reid (he was heading out to join up with Jim) headed upstairs to the Cineplex to play some air hockey. Luke went down in the first round, but it wasn&#8217;t an easy one. (Sake really destroys hand-eye coordination.) He&#8217;d get his revenge later on. We went around to various video games before deciding to give pool a shot. Somehow, we ended up playing darts instead. That took a while, since none of the four of us were any good.<br />
Oh, and that round of bottle caps (drinks, not the candy) didn&#8217;t really help, either.<br />
Scott and I finished a round of pool while waiting for Luke and Linday to finish their darts game. Despite having a near total lack of coordination at this point, I was able to aim surprisingly well. The lack of coordination finally showed through when Luke took me down in a final game of air hockey.<br />
With that, we all headed out into the unusually warm Calgary evening, Luke and Linday heading up to Crescent Heights, Scott and I heading over to my place in Sunnyside. I offered to give Scott a ride home, but needed to sit down a while and rest before getting behind a wheel. (Just because I&#8217;m inebriated doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m irresponsible.)<br />
We watched The Simpsons on DVD before I was inspired to put on The Great Escape. I fell asleep barely into the movie (I was exhausted), waking up about an hour or so in. By this point, it was almost 3:00. I took Scott home, hitting the sack almost as soon as I got back.<br />
The office will certainly be a quieter place without Luke around anymore. But we&#8217;re sure we&#8217;re going to see him from time to time.<br />
After all, he&#8217;s gonna miss us at the breakfast table.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s 23:00 Sunday night, and this is the first time in four days that I&#8217;ve had a chance to be alone with my computer.<br />
Not that I&#8217;m necessarily complaining, I might add.<br />
The last four days have been a mad combination of work-related mayhem, drunken debauchery (see: work-related mayhem), and spending time with Alex. All of it has been great fun, which is why I need two entries to cover it all. But first, the work-related mayhem and drunken debauchery &#8230; more or less in that order.<br />
Every six months, Critical Mass holds a Town Hall. It&#8217;s a gathering of everyone in the company, remote offices included, to listen to information the company wishes to disseminate in a semi-public forum. The Town Halls held in January are mostly business. Numbers, facts, trends&#8230; you usually need several strong coffees to get you through them. But the ones in June are a special breed &#8212; it&#8217;s more of a show than real information. It&#8217;s almost an excuse to leave the office and watch a bunch of people entertain the rest of us, gain a bit more information than we already did, and then go drinking.<br />
At least, that&#8217;s what this one was like.<br />
We gathered at the Vertigo Theatre, in the basement of the Calgary Tower complex downtown, not far from the office. This apparently used to be an old movie theatre, now converted into fairly nice stage theatres. When we arrived in the lobby, we were split into small groups (for what reason, I wasn&#8217;t initially certain. When our group was called, we walked over to the theatre door, but were thrown up against the wall, and subjected to what I can only describe as a severe infraction of the Geneva Convention. We had to sing The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;Macho Man&#8221;.<br />
This was courtesy of Dan, my business unit&#8217;s Managing Director. He was strung out on something (either far too much caffeine, or something far more exotic), wearing a microphone of a style made famous by Garth Brooks, and yelling like he was on TV. Apparently, so were we. As Phillipe filmed, we were made to cheer, laugh, heckle, and boo. Then came the song. We were quite puzzled, to say the least. It came quite clear when we entered the theatre, only to find the next group after us being subjected to the same humilation &#8212; broadcast onto a large screen on the stage.<br />
Once everyone had been put through the wringer and the auditorium was full, we began the show. Dan walked out on stage, still wearing the mike, announcing that he was the stage manager of this freak show, and it was time to get it going. So with no further adieu, he welcome onstage the announcer, the man with the best radio voice in the company, Scott. Naturally, this precipitated a loud cheer from those of us who work with him. Scott then took over, bringing on the musical host of this wacky production, which was to no-one&#8217;s surprise, our sound engineer, Dewi. And then came the host, the man who puts the &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;loser&#8221; (bit of an in-joke, due to his last name), my *boss*, Allard.<br />
*That* suprised me. No, actually, that *stunned* me. I simply did not see that coming. But the fact that he was hosting the little deal was nothing compared with the fact that he was not only good at what he did, he was *amazing*. As I would find out later, almost none of Allard&#8217;s material was scripted (at least so that he had to remember it). He either only had vague directions leading to some dialogue, or completely adlibbed. His opening monologue was actually very funny. He even caught our CEO, Jerry, completely off-guard by calling him by his initials: JJ &#8230; and JK, JL, JM, J-Lo. (Jerry&#8217;s reactions to Allard&#8217;s off-the-cuff comments were almost as entertaining as the comments.)<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;ve challenged Allard to keep this up for our meetings. He&#8217;ll make them a lot more interesting.<br />
Several videos peppered the skits that the group put on. The group included the five previously mentioned, Thelton, Dave, Carl (who did a great job presenting the true direction of the company), two Peters, Simone, Robb, Chrissie, Ed, Jason, Arif (a mainstay of all our Town Halls), and &#8220;guest appearances&#8221; by Cory, Colin, and the infamous rubber chicken. While the chicken incident kind of bombed (the joke was a little abused as of late), the videos had people rolling in many cases.<br />
The bulk of the actual business information came from the rather lengthy Q&amp;A session with Thelton and Jerry, kicked off by the question that all inquiring minds wanted to know: Boxers or briefs? While Thelton and JZ were hoping to avoid some of the more numbers-related questions, they invariably arose (hard not to, I guess). But they were all answered. And we ended the session early.<br />
Early enough for the aforementioned debauchery.<br />
This year, we ended up at the Whiskey. They weren&#8217;t ready for us when we arrived, and the poor bartender upstairs had to run around frantically to get ready. We got there about an hour ahead of time. But frankly, that&#8217;s not an excuse. The inside of the Whiskey was dead. Can you expect me to believe that they couldn&#8217;t have had the upstairs ready in time? Not swift, if you ask me. But soon enough, we were getting loaded, and that&#8217;s all that really matters.<br />
A water gun made an appearance, weilded by Thelton. (You got to love a President who&#8217;s willing to be as immature as the rest of us.) Adrian tackled him to get it away and hose down others. I got wet on a few occassions, but didn&#8217;t care so long as the camera stayed dry.<br />
Before I knew it, the sun was setting, and a group of us were heading over to the Bear and Kilt to continue festivities. The antics, including spilled beers (on the pool table, so I gather &#8212; that wasn&#8217;t me, incidentally), spilled french fries and beef dip sauce (that was me), and probably more than a few spilled secrets (don&#8217;t know if that was me or not &#8212; I was very drunk by then) flowed about. By after 1:00, it was time to go home.<br />
Mark, Amy, and I wandered down 4th St. to take Amy home. Mark headed off at 17th Ave., with the two of us continuing south. Amy offered to put me up at her place overnight, but I needed to get home for my cameras for the following morning. Despite two stops for hangover prevention, I woke up with a killer headache.<br />
Just in time for the Kananaskis Cowpunch.<br />
&#8220;What on Earth is that?&#8221; you might be asking. This is the name for this year&#8217;s company summer event. Arriving at the office (holding my head and liberally drinking a bottle of Gatorade), we waited for the signal to board our buses and head out to the Rafter 6 Ranch, not far from Exshaw. There, we would engage in activities that would have nothing to do with our daily job. This included golf (nine holes), white water rafting, horseback riding (western-style), yoga, hiking, or canoeing. Me? I chose to do nothing, and take pictures instead.<br />
Why? Well, I don&#8217;t have my own clubs, and I play cross-country golf. (I&#8217;m pretty bad.) I&#8217;ve done white water rafting on the Kicking Horse River three times &#8212; the Kananaskis River just ain&#8217;t gonna cut it. I&#8217;ve never been a big fan of horses, so riding was out. As for yoga, while I do love it, I&#8217;m very partial to my yoga instructor, Lori, and wasn&#8217;t really in the mood for someone different. Hiking didn&#8217;t sound interesting at first, though I found out later that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have minded it. As for canoeing, it was in a 12-person canoe. That&#8217;s a dragonboat to me, which is not really quite what I had in mind for relaxing.<br />
Besides, *someone* needs to take the pictures.<br />
The weather in Calgary and area as of late resembled that of Vancouver &#8212; wet and miserable. Cyndy, our office manager and the one who organized most of this, was unbelievably relieved to see that the weather had panned out. She swore that things weren&#8217;t going to work out. But the sun was out, the weather was warm, and clouds were few and far between. Almost as soon as we arrived at the Ranch (the golfers went direct to the course), the groups went off to get ready.<br />
I wandered down to where the horse riders were gathered to hop on their mounts. The horses were not the happiest animals I&#8217;ve ever seen. They&#8217;re either extremely well-trained, or (and I hate to suggest it) abused. They didn&#8217;t move very much, and didn&#8217;t seem particularly energetic. As I don&#8217;t know horse behaviour that well, I can only assume (and hope) that Rafter 6 Ranch follows proper animal treatment guidelines.<br />
Over at the rafting shed, the majority of the CM group was getting their waivers sorted out (which apparently contained some clause about bears, of all things) and preparing to get their equipment to head out. I really wanted to get photos of the rafters on the water, but as I had no idea where they were setting in (it wasn&#8217;t at the Ranch), I had to settle for some group shots pre-wetsuits.<br />
I passed back and forth between the horse riders (it took a while to get them all on horseback) and the rafters (it took a while to get them all in rubber) until both groups had headed off. Luke, the largest person in the rafting group, looked about the most uncomfortable in his wetsuit. I so desperately wanted a picture of him in his neoprene skin, but he wisely declined.<br />
The horses were mostly watching people who have either never ridden a horse, or looked very uncomfortable on a horse, waiting around for the rest of the group (there would be two waves) to get their horse. Some people were fairly even with their steeds, and aside from a bit of uneasiness, were ready to ride. Some, like Jamie, looked like they&#8217;d never been on a horse before (Jamie actually said: &#8220;How does this thing work?&#8221; &#8212; it was hard to tell if he was serious or not).<br />
Then there was Garth. Garth is our DBA Manager. Garth seemed to really know what he was doing. I even commented on it.<br />
Me: Garth, you sound like an old ranch hand!<br />
Garth: I am.<br />
Figures I&#8217;d meet a DBA Manager who grew up on a farm south of Edmonton, who rode horses for the better part of a decade.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that there weren&#8217;t a couple of problems. Terri&#8217;s horse suddenly decided to not want to cooperate and reared up. Terri, fearing a bucking, grabbed the reins to keep from falling off. Sadly, not the correct course of action, as pulling back on the reins only makes the horse rear more. It took a few quick commands from the handlers to keep Terri from falling off.<br />
Horses off and rafters away, I wandered back up to our portion of the ranch to hang out for the next couple of hours. There, I found Cyndy and Lindsay, who had beers in hand. It appeared the bar was officially open.<br />
And everyone else thought I was missing out on activities&#8230;<br />
We chatted a while, admiring the surrounding area. The Rafter 6 is located in a wonderful little pocket of Kananaskis, within spitting distance of the mountains without actually being in them. And far enough away from the highway that you can&#8217;t hear it. Just the wind, the birds, the odd nickering of a horse, wind through the trees, and the river (once you get close enough to it, anyway).<br />
The Ranch is about 200 years old, so I&#8217;m told. It&#8217;s also massive, though I suspect much of the land has either been turned into random pasture land (instead of the need for huge expanses for cattle) with some turned over to other interests (there&#8217;s a YMCA camp &#8220;next door&#8221;, which I imagine was once part of the ranch itself). But there&#8217;s still ample room to wander around. The grounds have several buildings, including the hotel, dining hall, barn, several cabins, and the chapel (which was where the yoginis practiced their moves &#8212; quite a beautiful sight from where we were).<br />
Lindsay and I decided to go off on a short walk to find the others in our &#8220;do nothing&#8221; group. We headed down to the river (we understood that Pavel had brought a fishing rod), babbling the whole way there and back. We never found the rest of the group, but did have a nice walk, nonetheless.<br />
Lunch was not far off when we got back, which was about the time that the hikers, horse riders, and rafter returned. Yoga had finished, the participants changed and lounging around. Slowly, but surely, the group was regathering. Cyndy and I went out to meet the horse riders as they trotted through. Cyndy was having far too much fun with everyone else, and commented that they&#8217;d all be walking bow-legged for a while. Someone commented about needing a rub-down &#8230; then Harjinder commented about needing some Vaseline. I nearly dropped the camera from laughing so hard.<br />
Lunch was hamburgers, chicken, vegetable shishkebabs, baked beans, and salads. Following what most of us considered to be normal buffet behaviour, we grabbed two hamburger buns and got in line. One burger each. Fine, we&#8217;ll just come back later. Apparently, Rafter 6 had only enough buns so that we&#8217;d have *one* burger each. One. Just one. Uh, hello? It&#8217;s a barbecue. No-one has just *one*. Sliced bread had to come out for everyone else. The golfers finally showed up as the first round of lunch was wrapping up.<br />
After lunch, we had completely unstructure free time. This led Luke, Torin, and myself to go way out into the fields and throw around Luke&#8217;s aerobee (basically, a flying ring, as opposed to the standard Frisbee). My aim was way off for the first little while, and I made Luke and Torin run a bit. I eventually grew tired of the activity, and resumed photography.<br />
I was waiting for the &#8220;surprise&#8221;. At 14:30, we were told to head down to the rodeo corral for the remainder of the afternoon. This was for a rodeo, though not with any animals other than horses. This was a volunteer rodeo, where various members of the staff would hop on a horse and make a horse&#8217;s ass of themselves. Which, of course, is the point.<br />
More food would await us. As I approached the rodeo corral, I saw a large group of people milling around something, then walking off with &#8230; ICE CREAM! Changing my direction, I went in direction of something cold and yummy. I had thought the vessel holding the cool treats was a freezer of some kind. But we were on a ranch &#8212; the ice cream was contained in soft-sided insulated bags, slung over the back of a miniature horse. It was very cute, although the little guy REALLY hated the bags, and didn&#8217;t really appreciate 200 somewhat drunk people surrounding it.<br />
The rodeo was quite simple: a corral, six horses, and a few interesting games. First up was Musical Horses. Similar to musical chairs, the idea is to walk your horse around a ring of tires. When the music stops, you jump down and put one foot in the tire. The rest is pretty self-explanatory. Then there was the egg race, which is a lap around the corral holding an egg on a spoon. Following that was a race where two people (on different horses) had to hold a piece of plastic tape between them. First ones across the finish line still holding the tape between them won. Then came the barrel race, a rodeo mainstay, involving a little more horsemanship to get around all the barrels. A bizarre relay race came afterwards, involving two riders per horse and a few transgender clothing swaps. The final race was the favourite: the beer race. That&#8217;s when six riders run to the other end, chug a beer (you have to turn it upside down over your head to prove you&#8217;ve finished), then race back.<br />
Musical horses was quite funny. Dan got stuck with the smallest horse, which he seemed rather proud about. Dan was quite adept with his little horse, out-maneuvering several others, only to finally be defeated because his horse wanted to grandstand instead of co-operate. The music, incidentally, was the rest of us singing &#8220;100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall&#8221;, which went something like this:<br />
&#8220;100 bottles of beer on the wall, 100 bottles of beer, [incoherent mumbling following the tune of the song], 99 bottles of beer on the wall&#8230;&#8221; and so on.<br />
Partway through the rodeo, I opted to go get another ice cream. It was hot, and they&#8217;re tasty. And that&#8217;s all the excuse I need, darn it! When I got out there, the wee little horsie wasn&#8217;t in much better of a mood than when I&#8217;d first come across him. In fact, as I attempted to get my ice cream bar, the little bugger got out of his bridle, and started to pull away. His handler tried to hang onto him, but only got one of the refrigerator bags off instead. Released of the grip, he was off like a shot, tearing away at a rate you couldn&#8217;t have convinced me a little thing like that could do! He even kept up with the bigger horses. One of the ranch hands took off after him with a lasso. Had my hands not been full, I would have been able to get the whole event on video.<br />
The egg race was a little dull, other than all the fallen eggs, of course. The tape race was only amusing insofar as watching Evelyn and Jamie try to stay on their horses and still hang onto the tape. Jamie&#8217;s prowess with a horse is &#8230; well, nigh non-existant, so he was having difficulties staying with Evelyn. The barrel race was a bit of a heart-stopper when Marcie fell off when her horse came to a dead halt as it prepared to go around the last barrel. Thankfully, she was alright. Moments later, the same thing nearly happened to the next person, but recovered in time. The clothes race was something to watch, if only to see Jerry in a frilly woman&#8217;s bathing suit.<br />
The beer race was the contentious one. It came down to two key competitors: Bill and Chris. On the first race, Bill won but was called out for supposedly not drinking all of his beer (on video replay, there was a bit too much landing on his hat). Chris, reported to be the fasted guzzle in the west, probably felt a bit cheated. So there was a rematch, pitting the two (and Lindsay, who came in third) to resolve the issue. This time, Chris raced to success, with Bill a little more drunk for wear.<br />
The rodeo over, we all headed back to the dining area to relax until the busses were called &#8212; not long afterwards. By this point, I was resembling a lobster (or rather, I was told I was; in reality I wasn&#8217;t nearly that bad), and felt it wise to head out on the first wave of busses. However, I should have waited for the fourth and final bus.<br />
Those who did engaged in what I could only imagine to be the wildest bus party the company has ever seen. Cyndy was so loopy, she was tossing clothing out the window as it went down the road (I have no idea whose it was). Waterguns were soaking everything in sight. Thelton decided to try and sneak up on Shawn, our Account Director in Austin, crawling along the aisle floor on all fours. Shawn, however, saw Thelton coming, crawled over two rows of chairs to empty his beer onto Thelton&#8217;s head. A pit stop at a Petro-Canada set off a round of stickering (mostly on people) and a run on beef jerky. Somewhere along the line, Cyndy declared something about &#8220;getting nekkid&#8221; and swapped shirts with Jim.<br />
*Sigh* I miss all the fun.<br />
We were to head to Coyotes after arriving back at Critical Mass. There we engaged in more games of &#8220;see how many drink tickets we can get from Thelton&#8221;, among babbling with each other. Staying at Coyotes was not an option, however. Coyotes is not really my first choice for a good bar to go to &#8230; actually, it would be my *last* choice, along with Cowboys and Tantra (formerly The Drink). Such as it was, however, the beer was free, and that was reason enough.<br />
Luke, Allison, James, Torin, Scott, Natalia, Wendy, Alain, Gary, and myself vacated (long before the Miss Corona pageant was to start, thankfully) and went to Sumo over in Eau Claire Market. There we gorged ourselves on Japanese (mostly sushi) and swapped stories about the day. As the sun slowly set, a chill came over. About 30 minutes before we left, Torin barked out &#8220;Hey Jerks!&#8221; to someone passing by the patio we were on. It was Jerry, Scott (from Chicago) and Shawn. Jerry whipped around to see who had insulted him. Seeing it was just us, he barked back: &#8220;F*ck you!&#8221; We laughed.<br />
The evening over, I retreated back to my safe little home to recover from the day. Lest you think I was heavily intoxicated at the time &#8212; I was very sober. In fact, I&#8217;d spent the whole day pretty much peachy. Not driveable-peachy, but not even really buzzed. Hangovers tend to make you not want to drink as much the next day, I find. No, the reason I went home was that I was very, very tired.<br />
And after the last two days, I needed the rest.<br />

		<blockquote><p>And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,<br />
Don&#8217;t carry the world upon your shoulders.<br />
For well you know that it&#8217;s a fool who plays it cool<br />
By making his world a little colder.<br />
<cite>&#8212; &#8220;Hey Jude&#8221;, The Beatles</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>(I&#8217;ve been wanting to quote that bit for <em>years</em>.)<br />
Another veteran of Critical Mass&#8217;s Web Development ranks is heading for greener pastures, palm trees, and dates with Hollywood models (we can only assume). It half came as a surprise, the rest as a disappointed sadness, when I found out that Jude Matsalla was leaving.<br />
Jude has been at Critical Mass for well over five years. Jude was always one of our innovators, one of those people who always pushed the envelope for all the really interesting ideas, someone the rest of us always looked up to. (Especially because Jude was always approachable, no matter how much stress he was under. Something I still need to work on.) He got an opportunity to move down to Pasedena for a while and check out the American life. Like several before him, he will be missed.<br />
Chrissie, one of our long-time veterans of Project Management, couldn&#8217;t let Jude go without a fight. So she organized a send-up for him, to ensure that Jude would remember his time at Critical Mass. (I would have assumed he&#8217;d get the usual Critical Mass logo cattle brand, but I guess since Jude&#8217;s a vegetarian, the only logical thing was mental trauma.) So was planned a three-event outing on Friday evening.<br />
Stop number one was at Ming, a trendy bar cum bistro on 17th Avenue. I&#8217;ve been there a couple of time before, but it&#8217;s never really been one of my more favourite places, especially when you&#8217;re with a large group. It&#8217;s just hard to get the people in that tiny little space. But being true to the Critical Mass spirit (which, in many ways, resembles university fraternities), we crammed in everyone who wanted to come out.<br />
Scott, Luke, and I walked down from the office, partly because we had no car, but also because Calgary was being blessed with a wonderfully warm day (for a change &#8212; May always has strange weather). As we approached Ming, we noticed two things: Thelton&#8217;s red Mini parked out front (Thelton got his Mini long after I got mine &#8212; the copycat! &#8212; but at least he got a different colour), and the City of Calgary Parking Enforcement car pulling up behind it. (You&#8217;re not allowed to park on 17th Ave. until after 18:00.) Thelton was quickly warned, and managed to avoid a ticket.<br />
We were among the earlier ones to arrive, but soon the Mass started to appear, and all were packed into the little space under the stairs. Eventually, we overflowed into other parts of the bar. People who didn&#8217;t normally come out to such events rounded out the list of usual suspects (but we never achieved the sheer outpouring seen at Ben Wong&#8217;s departure &#8212; see [[Three Parties and a Little Hockey]]), even if they were only out for a while.<br />
We were even joined by Rudy (one of our web developers) and his &#8220;manservant&#8221; Virgil (a former Critical Mass employee, and friend, of whom you&#8217;ve heard many times before). Rudy was in a motorcycle accident a couple of weeks ago, and has been out sick ever since. He hobbled into Ming on crutches to make an appearance. At which point we yelled:<br />
&#8220;If you&#8217;re good enough to come to a bar, you can whack out some code! Get your butt back to the office, ya slacker!&#8221;<br />
All in good jest, of course.<br />
The plan had been to adjourn to the second destination at 19:00, but we didn&#8217;t start moving until almost 20:00. James, Scott, Colin, Jude, and myself all piled into James&#8217; car, and we fired off in the direction of Lloyd&#8217;s, in the southern part of Calgary (north of Heritage Drive). Lloyd&#8217;s is an institution in Calgary &#8212; it&#8217;s where teenagers go to rollerskate.<br />
Yes, rollerskating. Wasn&#8217;t exactly on my list of things I have to do before I die. Colin and I took a bit of a detour, though, and opted for a pizza at Tom&#8217;s Pizza, instead. That, two beers, and a really long conversation. Colin and I have these every now and then. It really feels good to have them, because I really feel isolated from all the other developers being on the Mercedes account.<br />
Getting into Lloyd&#8217;s, we found James, Scott, and Jude hanging out with Chrissie, Jason, Jude&#8217;s cousin Vince, Rob, and Rob&#8217;s girlfriend (whose name I&#8217;ve forgotten). Colin and I didn&#8217;t bother with skates &#8212; neither of us were particularly interested. Instead, we watched as Jude attempted to jump from one chair to another, only to have his feet slide out from under him, and narrowly miss face-planting the floor. (Scott&#8217;s video capture will become an instant classic.)<br />
Not long after Colin and I arrived did the really bad music, lousy deejay, and the plethora of 15-year olds finally get to us, and we headed for older pastures. This took us to what we call the No Name Lounge. We call it that because, like the name suggests, it has no name. Literally. If you pass by on the street, you&#8217;d never know. There&#8217;s no name. Even the liquor license is numbered &#8212; no name. What do you tell your friends when you&#8217;re going to a place that has no name? It&#8217;s a little odd the first time.<br />
But it&#8217;s a nice place, and very cool. The interior is narrow, but long. It&#8217;s lit mostly by red lights, the deejay is an ex-Critical Mass employee who spins some amazing tunes (although we regularly complain that the deejay sucks, just for digs), and the decor is pretty chic &#8230; when you can actually see it. (The eyes take a few minutes to adjust.) This was our third and final stop for the night, where we hung out until the wee hours of the morning.<br />
Those of us from Lloyd&#8217;s were also joined by Mark, Carmen, Rudy, Virgil, Jason (two of them, actually), Laura, Michelle, Lindsay, Mabel, Shannon, and finally Pat (after Colin and I gave him grief for not showing up earlier). We never did see Angie, though. I finally left well into the next day, deciding that I&#8217;d had too much to drink, and desperately needed sleep.<br />
In all, it was a great departure. I could only hope that all parties are like this. I just hope we don&#8217;t have too many of them &#8212; my poor body can&#8217;t take all this.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are some rumours I understand. And there are others that I do not. There are some that I begin. But this is one I want to end.<br />
For years &#8212; literally, years &#8212; there is a rumour that&#8217;s been floating around Calgary that Critical Mass is going to lose the Mercedes-Benz USA account. We hear it every so often, usually from people in the industry or trying to get into the industry. But only people who work in Calgary &#8212; never from anywhere else. We used to hear this a lot more a couple of years ago. Back then, it was more a irritation. So imagine my surprise when it came up in an interview today.<br />
I think the last time I heard this rumour was when I&#8217;d been out with Virgil a couple of years ago (long before Chris left for Japan). I can&#8217;t quite remember the details, but Virgil&#8217;s friend was convinced we were going to lose the account, and his company was just going to sweep in there and take the business from us.<br />
What kills me is that this seems to be the prevailing attitude: that when Critical Mass loses the Mercedes-Benz USA account, someone in Calgary is going to get it. Okay, let&#8217;s have a little reality check here, okay? Critical Mass is about 200 people (don&#8217;t ask me for a specific number, simply because I don&#8217;t have one to give). If that 200 people, about 60 work on it full-time. That&#8217;s over 25% of our entire workforce, dedicated to a single account. Most interactive companies in Calgary aren&#8217;t 60 people in total, let alone that many to spare.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s assume for the moment that maybe &#8212; JUST MAYBE &#8212; you could handle something the side of Mercedes-Benz USA. What on Earth makes you think they&#8217;re coming back to Calgary? Just because Critical Mass is here? Maybe you think that Calgary&#8217;s cheapness offers an advantage? Maybe if you set up shop in, say, Moncton, you might have a chance. Believe me when I say that not only is Calgary not as cheap as it once was, there is a time difference which plays to be more of an inconvenience than you might imagine.<br />
Now to really sound like a jerk &#8212; who the hell do you think you are? As far as I know, there is ONE major interactive agency in town: Critical Mass. I know this because I keep an eye on the competition. And if you&#8217;re in Calgary, you&#8217;re not competition to Critical Mass. When we compete against companies like Agency.com, Organic, Modem Media, Sapient, Tribal, OgilvieInteractive, R/GA, and beat them out for contracts like NASA, Hyatt Hotels, Morgan Stanley, and Albertsons, that says something. When AdWeek lists you at #20 on their list of Top 50 Agencies, that says something.<br />
We have Mercedes-Benz USA because we&#8217;re good. And they know us.<br />
Think that&#8217;s not an issue? Think you can still win them over? Try this on for size. Not too long ago, Critical Mass went head-to-head with the heavyweights in the industry for a USD$12+ million contract. We *almost* won. Want to know why we didn&#8217;t? Because it would have cost the client too much money to move away from the agency they had. It boiled down to the pain point. And if for that reason alone, you&#8217;re not going to get Mercedes-Benz USA unless your company appears in AdWeek&#8217;s top 50 list.<br />
So please, if you work for an agency in Calgary, cash a reality check and realize that there is just no feasible away you can steal away an account that large. The industry has matured in the last four years. Big companies need established agencies. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re still here. And that&#8217;s why we aren&#8217;t going anywhere, except up, that is. If you&#8217;re so hell-bent on working on the Mercedes-Benz account, I can offer you one piece of advice:<br />
Apply for a job. We&#8217;re hiring.</p>

		<p>Psst! Hey, wanna hear something shocking? I&#8217;m taking yoga.<br />
Relax, I haven&#8217;t grown my hair out and gone hippy (well, the hair *has* grown out, but only because I haven&#8217;t had it cut in a month and a half), nor have I become a Stepford Wife. It&#8217;s the result of having talked to so many people about how good yoga is. I know, this kind of sounds like a &#8220;If Timmy jumped off a cliff&#8230;&#8221; thing. But admittedly, anything that&#8217;s been around for about 5,000 years and been practiced by countless millions of people can&#8217;t be all bad.<br />
Right?<br />
So when the rumour of a new yoga class starting up at work started running around, I make sure James kept me in the loop. Sure enough, when word officially came out, I forked over $80 and signed my life away (basically, a &#8220;I won&#8217;t sue you for anything stupid I do&#8221; form), bought a yoga mat (about six feet long, two and a half feet wide, and about 1/4 inch thick), and tried to prepare myself for something I&#8217;d never done before.<br />
The first class was a week ago yesterday. We had a class of about nine people (the full class will be about 10, but we have yet to have a full compliment), with participants from either Project Management or Technology, with one person from Creative. We all sit in the Theatre (chairs removed), while our instructor, Lori, leads us through the various motions.<br />
The first thing you need to know is that there isn&#8217;t just one yoga. In fact, there are 40 different kinds, such as Agni, Bhakti, Japa, Mantra, Tantra, and Hatha. The one we&#8217;re doing is called Ashtanga, which is &#8220;the unitive discipline of the eight limbs&#8221; &#8230; whatever that means. The easiest way to think of it is as the aerobic version of &#8220;regular&#8221; yoga (that&#8217;s &#8220;Hatha&#8221; yoga, in case you&#8217;re interested).<br />
The second thing is that yoga isn&#8217;t just standing (or sitting) in various poses. (Some yogas can be, but ashtanga definitely ain&#8217;t.) Each pose is for stretching, flexing, meditation, or a combination of all three. Especially with ashtanga, you&#8217;ll work up a good sweat, too. By the time you get to the end, you&#8217;ll either be dying for more, or thankful that it&#8217;s over for the day.<br />
And the third is a bit of an odd one: Breathing. Yeah, kind of an important one, I know. But it&#8217;s key to being able to ensure you&#8217;re getting not only enough oxygen to handle the workout, and block out the &#8220;discomfort&#8221; (as Lori puts it). The breathing manner is specific: Always through the nose, and using the ribs to breathe, not the belly (your abdominals should be contracted as much as possible). Inhaling, you try to make the sound &#8220;suh&#8221; (with your mouth closed, of course), while making the sound &#8220;ha&#8221; while exhaling.<br />
Sounds strange, I know. The reason is clear once you get into it, though. It&#8217;s not easy to do. In fact, when you&#8217;re in a particularly awkward pose &#8212; say, Paripurna Navasana (Full Boat Pose) &#8212; you can concentrate on getting your breathing correct and not so much on the fact that your legs feel like they&#8217;re about to rip your stomach muscles apart.<br />
Generally, each yoga session starts off with a series of three poses done in succession: Chaturanga Dandasana (Four-Limbed Staff Pose), which moves into Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (Upward-Facing Dog), then into Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog), which is held for up to two minutes at a time. This is to help get the body ready for the lesson it&#8217;s about to receive. It&#8217;s a bit of stretching, a bit of strength, and done just fast enough to get the blood flowing.<br />
After that, it&#8217;s up to the instructor to define their pattern of torture for the day.<br />
Day #1<br />
The rest of the class has done this before. Some of them are long-term veterans. I don&#8217;t have a clue what I&#8217;m doing. Lori&#8217;s kind enough to explain the breathing thing to me, since it makes no sense to me at first. She then suggests that I just try to concentrate on the breathing and not worry too much about getting the poses right.<br />
I spend a lot of time looking at her or others in the class, because I don&#8217;t understand a thing. Many of Lori&#8217;s words are in Sanskrit (the ancient Indian language used 5,000 years ago when yoga was first defined), and it&#8217;s traditional to use the Sanskrit words. I have no idea what &#8220;bondas&#8221; are, or what she&#8217;s saying when we&#8217;re supposed to &#8220;Svanasana&#8221;.<br />
At the end of the class, we assume a pose which is, well, laying down with eyes closed. It&#8217;s supposed to be for relaxation, but a few of us (not me) fall asleep. I find yoga, as experienced, a lot easier than I thought. So I gather, Lori took it light on us.<br />
Day #2<br />
This time, I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;ve got an idea of what yoga is, I sort of know the motions (well, some of them), and I&#8217;m prepared for the run. We do the opening, and then start trying a few new poses we didn&#8217;t do the week before. Some are easy, some are not. Lori also kicks it up a notch, and the class is bit harder than the first one. In general, I&#8217;m able to keep up.<br />
The breathing is difficult, and I often find myself remembering how I&#8217;m supposed to breathe. It helps me concentrate on something other than the severe wobbling on my legs in some of the poses. (The wobbling, incidentally, is partly due to the position that I&#8217;m in, and partly due to trying to keep my balance without falling over.)<br />
About halfway through the class, I realized I could get into full lotus pose. (Sitting down, it&#8217;s where your feet cross, heels near or touching the hips.) I haven&#8217;t done it in about two decades, but not for lack of trying &#8212; I just never thought to. I was quite amazed with myself, actually.<br />
I realize that the final pose is actually a pose, and not just us lying down. It&#8217;s called Savasana (Corpse Pose) and is designed as a relaxtion and meditative state. The idea is to calm the body and the mind after doing countless things to it. I think I&#8217;m going to start practicing this every night when I go to bed &#8212; I always want to fall asleep.<br />
Day #3<br />
I&#8217;m keen, but a little hesitant. Why? Well, the day before, I did a fairly strenuous leg workout at the gym. Lately, this hasn&#8217;t been too much of a problem, as the protein powder I now take seems to keep the recovery period extremely short. However, having missed most of last week to schedule and exhaustion, my legs took a little longer to heal up.<br />
Based on the previous class, I figured I&#8217;d have a good chance to stretch out my quadriceps (the troublesome muscles in question). What I didn&#8217;t figure on was Lori deciding to crank up the difficulty and really put us through our paces. And, I hope by complete coincidence, really focus on our legs.<br />
One particular pose she put us into, the name of which I don&#8217;t know, pretty much put me over the edge. Basically, you&#8217;re bend forward at the waist, feet hip-width apart and bent at the knees. Keeping the feet flat on the floor, you feed one arm between the legs, and the other wraps around your back, linking somewhere around your rear end. Normally, this isn&#8217;t a problem for me to do. However, the pain in my already-sore thighs was &#8230; exquisite.<br />
Ever felt like your quadriceps were going to physically separate from your femur?<br />
I had to drop out of the pose twice, especially after my left thigh started cramping. Not a good sign.<br />
We also did a pose that I found quite enjoyable. It goes like this: Sitting, bring your feet in as tight as you can to your groin. Then have the instructor stand on your knees while forcing your head down so that your forehead touches your toes.<br />
Now here&#8217;s the kicker: I liked it. (But then, I have a very flexible groin.)<br />
Another new position we was Bakasana (Crane Pose). It&#8217;s a bit of an odd one. You start with hands placed on the mat, shoulder-width apart, fingers spread widely. Then lean forward onto your arms, and place your knees just above the elbows, and roll forward until your feet come off the ground. Ideally, you&#8217;ll be standing on your hands, with (surprisingly) little stress on your wrist.<br />
It&#8217;s a hard position, partly due to upper body strength, but also due to balance. I was actually quite amazed that I could even get into it. Unfortunately, while my strength seemed to be agreeing, my balance wasn&#8217;t as cooperative. I muttered in my thoughts:<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; don&#8217;t fall &#8230; oh, crap &#8230;&#8221;<br />
Thump.<br />
Right on my head, too. I had laughed at my friend because she, while doing the same pose at her class, had landed on her face. She quite rightly returned the favour when I told her about my limited success.<br />
Then we moved onto headstands. I hadn&#8217;t done one since I was in high school. I need a little practice. Surprisingly enough, getting up wasn&#8217;t really that hard. It was staying there. I thought I&#8217;d had it balanced well. But when I felt my feet having gone past the point of no return, all I could was do a tuck and roll out of what would have been a complete collapse.<br />
By the end of the class, my legs were hamburger formed into two bulky bags that somehow supported my torso and allowed me to walk. Walking down the stairs was difficult. (Heck, walking on a horizontal surface was a bit of a challenge.) I fully expected to pay for it the following morning.<br />
But despite how badly I hurt, I woke up relatively pain-free this morning. Somehow, all the stretching cancelled out the muscle shredding, and I was able to move without a wheelchair. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next class on Tuesday, without a clue of what Lori is going to do to us next. It&#8217;s going to be an interesting set of classes, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to get a lot out of yoga.<br />
The only drawback? I feel like going into Savasana during meetings&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It seems that Critical Mass is losing too many good people within a very short period of time. First, it was a round of layoffs nearly three weeks ago. Now it&#8217;s a series of resignations. Among them is Arthur.<br />
Arthur came to Critical Mass about two months after I&#8217;d started. He&#8217;d moved into the interactive agency world after realizing that banking just wasn&#8217;t for him. He sat next to me in our old building. Starting off in QA, Arthur worked himself up to the point where he could switch into Web Development, where he did a variety of projects before landing on the Mercedes-Benz account.<br />
For at least two years, Arthur was the lead Web Developer on the Dealers projects, although last year he also ran the Web Development end of the Collection migration. In no case an easy job. He worked long hours when necessary, and never once complained about the job. Truly a model employee.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t work that defined him. It was being himself. He&#8217;s thoughtful, kind, caring, always willing to help, and will go out of his way to take on a challenge when he sees the opportunity. This is how Arthur came to be my coach and mentor for physical fitness. He&#8217;s the one who set me up with my program, changed my eating habits, and encouraged me to try different things and move ahead.<br />
And I wasn&#8217;t the only one who had seen this sort of thing in him. Many people at Critical Mass who have come to know Arthur over the last three and a half years would be sad to see him go. Which is why on Friday, we held a going-away party for him at Vicious Circle.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people showed up, but we&#8217;d pulled out well in excess of 50 people. We had three our four large tables at the club filled with folks. Well, all but one person in particular. Arthur was late. Somehow, I wasn&#8217;t particularly surprised that the guest of honour was running 45 minutes late.<br />
People came and went over the next few hours. Soon, we were down to a solitary table, harbouring Arthur, Angie, Pat, Colin, Reid, Jude, Rudy, John, and myself. Somewhere around midnight (I&#8217;m guessing), we opted to move to a different venue. So we were off in a few vehicles for what we call the No Name Lounge, a club near 17th Ave. and 14th St. that, quite literally, has no name. (It&#8217;s probably a numbered company for the purposes of liquor licenses, et al.)<br />
We&#8217;d been there once before for Rudy&#8217;s little send off before he&#8217;d vanished to the South Pacific for a month over Christmas. There were significantly more people inside this time around, but as was the case before, the music was stellar, and the venue loads of fun.<br />
Just after 1:30, we&#8217;d realized that we&#8217;d had enough for one night. Arthur, Rudy, and Jude had already vanished for the Cherry Lounge, but the rest of us were not to follow. Angie went home (Reid making sure she got there okay), while Pat, John, Colin, and I saddled up for the ride home.<br />
Dropping John off at his place, Pat, Colin, and I headed in search of sustinence. We were starving. A night of revelry and far too much beer for our own good (we were pretty much sober by this point, incidentally) brought us to the most popular eatery on 17th Ave. for those out partying: Wicked Wedge. A slice of a &#8220;Chief Wiggum&#8221; pizza and a small Coke did wonders for me &#8230; and probably not for my diet. (I was willing to make an exception.)<br />
Pat and I drove Colin up to his place in Rocky Ridge (pretty much most of the way to Cochrane), engaging in a bitch-fest the likes of which I haven&#8217;t been in for a very long time. The three of us are long-time Critical Mass veterans (except that Pat was laid off three weeks ago), so we&#8217;ve seen it all. Literally. And we know what&#8217;s good and what needs help.<br />
*Sigh* If only we ran things. (And while I&#8217;m dreaming about things I don&#8217;t really want, I&#8217;d like to be a famous movie star.)<br />
Pat dropped me off just after 3:00. The house was cold and dark. But I didn&#8217;t mind at all. I crawled into bed, curled up in a fetal position, and let the sleep of the wicked steal me away for a few hours. I just hope no-one else leaves anytime soon. I don&#8217;t think my body can take it.<br />
In a couple of weeks, Arthur leaves for Toronto. No more morning workout sessions. No more suggestions on how to improve. No more crack comments as he passes my desk. (Hmmm&#8230; suddenly, this isn&#8217;t looking like such a bad thing.) But such is life. You can&#8217;t get into a pattern for too long before something has to change.<br />
Take care, Arthur! I&#8217;m sure our paths will cross again.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hereby lodge as much a formal complaint to the final outcome of last night&#8217;s team building event as one can without a process by which to handle it. So I&#8217;m throwing it out on the Internet for all to see.<br />
But more on that in a minute &#8230; or five.<br />
This week, Critical Mass&#8217; first and still largest client, Mercedes-Benz USA, came up to the mind-numbingly cold Great White North of Calgary for Year 2004 planning meetings.<br />
Client meetings can go one of two ways: good, and horrible. I have the fortune, thus far, of never having had the latter. All of the client meetings have been good: productive, educational, if perhaps a little dry from time to time. But at the end of the day, you can walk off knowing that you&#8217;ve done a good job.<br />
I&#8217;ve been on the Mercedes account for over three years, now. Overall, it&#8217;s been a fairly good (albeit trying) experience. But in those three years, I hadn&#8217;t really met the client before. So walking onto the fourth floor, I ran into a lot of people I had never really met before.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s not entirely fair. I had &#8220;met&#8221; most of them during a previous visit, about this time last year (before I was promoted into the lead team). They came by on a tour, shook hands, I did a 30-second unprepared song and dance, they walked off. Now I had to remember their names and interact with them. (Not that is a bad thing in any way.)<br />
Wednesday was our first day of meetings. Eight o&#8217;clock in the morning until after five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. Straight. Wednesday night was the first event, which was a kind of cooking class. Can&#8217;t tell you anything about it, though. Wasn&#8217;t invited. (Although I&#8217;m a lead, apparently I&#8217;m not important enough to be considered for some things &#8230; the rel reason was due to too many people on the team, and that I don&#8217;t have direct contact with the client on a regular basis).<br />
The first activity of the day, though, was a team-building event. Basically, personality bingo. We had to go around the room and find things that people could do or have done (for example, who could drive stick shift or who had been to five countries).<br />
The next thing was a review of management types. We had all done a survey that produced our management strengths. The result is one of four &#8220;colours&#8221;: red (direct and to-the-point), green (extroverted), blue (planning), and yellow (structured). The idea is to focus on the strengths, and know how you communicate with other colours.<br />
I&#8217;m a blue, for the record. It&#8217;s characterized by taking time to get all the facts, understand the situation, and plan things out. Supposedly, one of the other characteristics is a long fuse (apparently, we can take a lot of crap); but when it burns out, run.<br />
At the time I saw that characteristic, I actually took a bit of offence. I used to be like that. Won&#8217;t deny it &#8212; can&#8217;t deny it. But I&#8217;ve taken great strides in keeping my temper in check. I would even go so far as to say that I&#8217;m a lot more laid back than I used to be.<br />
Thursday. Stories of the dinner the night before. More meetings. A little later of a start, but the same sort of results. The technology review got booted twice, and ultimately delayed until today (we&#8217;re just getting underway as I type this, and I wonder if we&#8217;ll be getting to it at all).<br />
The thing we looked forward to most, though, was the team event. This typically happens on the last night of a meetings. It&#8217;s always different, but almost always fun. I don&#8217;t know what they did last time, but a couple years ago they did the O-Lame-Pics, which was some combination of winter &#8220;sports&#8221;. This year was something different.<br />
At first, we were actually told we needed to bring snowpants. I have no idea why, but I can only guess there was something to do with, well, snow. (I know, took a real stretch of deduction.) That was changed when we were told that we would not be outdoors for more than seven minutes at a time. But we were not told what the event was. All we were told was to be in the Walker Room of the Hyatt hotel at 18:15.<br />
At about 18:30, the game was finally announced: The Amazing Freeze. Based on the reality show &#8220;The Amazing Race&#8221;, the idea was that we would run around downtown Calgary, doing various events and getting clues to the next event.<br />
Sounds pretty straight-forward, eh? Well, here&#8217;s something to really throw a wrench in your aspirations. We were &#8220;randomly&#8221; (I assume randomness, but have to really wonder) put into teams of 5-6 people. While most of the teams were a blend of Critical Mass and Mercedes-Benz USA employees. As was with mine. Except for one detail.<br />
Everyone else was from New York. I was the only one who had any idea of where these places were.<br />
The teams were named by model. We were Team SL500 (my favourite Benz, although I&#8217;ll never be able to afford one). There was Anne, our account manager in New York; Ed, who runs the Dealers program at Mercedes; Diane, who runs the Owners program at Mercedes; Lark, who is one of Mercedes IT&#8217;s representatives; and yours truly.<br />
We were handed knapsacks. In these knapsacks were bottles of water, a pad of paper, two taxi chits, a couple of pens, and an emergency phone number to call in the event you somehow got lost.<br />
As we had already been drinking when we were handed the bag, the logical thing to do was replace the bottles of water with bottles of beer and wine. (Hey, if you&#8217;re gonna run around downtown Calgary like maniacs, you might as well be loaded while doing it.)<br />
We then got our first clue. The entire group of about 25 people rushed out of the hotel en masse (I can only imagine what the other guests were thinking), dashing off to their first destinations. Three groups (including ours) ended up at the James Joyce. First challenge: sidle up to the bar, and suck back a few shots. Jim Beam. Blech.<br />
Next clue took us to the Calgary Tower. I started making the team run. I got caught up in the competition. This was a bit of a challenge, because Lark and Ed don&#8217;t run, Diane is a self-professed &#8220;lazy New Yorker&#8221;, and I had a little too much energy for my own good. We ran across red lights.<br />
A list of 10 questions, including the name of the building with a yellow plane in its lobby (the Petro-Canada Tower), the date Calgary became a city (1884), or what building was built for the 1983 Summer Games (the Lindsay Park facility, now known as the Talisman Centre, which had been the velodrome, I believe). Assuming you didn&#8217;t know the answers, you could find them by using four kiosks around the tower&#8217;s observation level.<br />
We ran a lot.<br />
Questions filled in, we caught the elevator back down. As we caught our breath, we had an Australian couple (I think they were Australian) take our team photo. In the spirit of the game, and because the shots had kicked in by that time, Lark offered the couple one of our bottles of beer.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen such a confused and bewildered look before in my life.<br />
Turning the question sheet over to the clerk at the desk (who had answered &#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8221; when asked if he would help us with the question sheet), we received our next clue. It took a moment for me to figure out what it said (remember, the shots had kicked in), and we ran off to Winner&#8217;s to get a team &#8220;uniform&#8221; that could be purchased for CDN$60.<br />
The Winner&#8217;s staff were probably more confused than the couple in the elevator. All they knew was that there would be teams of people running through the store on some goofy quest. But first, we needed a team uniform. The team made a quick decision: socks. Really ugly ones. Ed was so enthusiastic, he ripped them from the racks, the little plastic clips flying everywhere. Ed ran back to the cashier, Diane apologising to the clerk for our haste.<br />
Right about then, Lark started telling the clerk (who was holding our clue envelopes) that she was with another team. Somehow, she got the CLK500 envelope. At this point, Diane and I got on the fairness bandwagon and decried Lark&#8217;s underhandedness, and made her hand it back.<br />
If we&#8217;d been thinking, we would have grabbed all the envelopes and scrambled the clues (they were all different). Oh well, lesson learned.<br />
Atrocious socks in hand, we were off to the Glenbow Museum. (Yes, running. Well, I was. The rest of the team, not so much.) We had a choice: either run through the Bog People exhibit (which I saw about a week and a half ago), or take the detour. The detour won, hands-down.<br />
The detour was simple, though: tie ourselves together with scarves, run out to Macleod Trail, and run back. The whole thing took about 30 seconds. We chanted like Marines as we jogged down the block and back. Next clue: Off to sushi.<br />
If there was one key mistake that we made, it was following the instructions and taking the C-Train. If we&#8217;d been thinking, we&#8217;d have taken a taxi. So we had to wait 10 minutes for a train to show up.<br />
But we sort of played the taxi angle. While the rest of us waited on the platform, Ed wandered out to the road to flag something down. He didn&#8217;t find a taxi, but managed to frighten some poor woman in a minivan (she locked her doors), tried to flag down one of Calgary Transit&#8217;s community busses, and almost stopped a police SUV.<br />
The train finally showed up, and we headed off to the 7th St. stop, at the other end of downtown. We were the last team to get to Sushi Hiro (but not because we were slow; that was just our last stop). We had to wait for the previous team to finish and leave.<br />
The game was a kind of fear factor: people had to eat sushi. Oh. My. Such fear. The longest part of the effort was laying claim to the sushi we wanted to eat. It disappeared in less time than we&#8217;d had to wait to eat it. (Lark pulled out the wine, and Ed cracked a beer &#8230; with his teeth, no less!) Back out the door, we started to flag down a cab, only to luck into having a cab be there, waiting. (It had been called by a previous team, and had been late arriving.) We were off to our final stop: Catch Restaurant.<br />
We didn&#8217;t use the taxi chits, Ed paid for the cab with cash. In the door, and up the stairs, we were the first team to arrive. We even had to find Eryn, who was more-or-less the ringleader of the whole event. The elation of being first, despite the odds that were against us, was outstanding.<br />
The rest of the teams started arriving. By the time we got back downstairs (we weren&#8217;t allowed upstairs yet, so had to wait in the Oyster Bar), the second team had arrived. It wasn&#8217;t long before most of the teams had finished, and we were allowed back upstairs.<br />
Tales from the teams&#8217; exploits were traded around. No-one had gotten lost, but we weren&#8217;t the only ones to make mistakes. One team actually walked to Sushi Hiro and back, which added a significant portion of time to their race.<br />
We sat down to dinner, which consisted of salad or clam and oyster chowder, haibut or beef, and a chocolate mousse cake. Very tasty.<br />
Awards for the teams were handed out, from last to first. Eryn added colour commentary, which was definitely playful. Everyone was having fun. At least until they announced the winner.<br />
A different team supposedly won. They weren&#8217;t even the second team to come through the door! I was dumbfounded! And it was because, of all things, because they&#8217;d had to wait for sushi, so they got a time bonus.<br />
Remember that long fuse? It burned out.<br />
Considering the difficulties our team faced, we should have been granted a lot more leniency. But no, somewhere a serious breech of the rules occured and the winning team didn&#8217;t actually win. To put it succinctly, we were robbed.<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m still steamed. We got a coffee mug. Much better than the little keychain light, teddy bear, or box of Smarties of the other teams (the &#8220;winning&#8221; team made off like kings), but it&#8217;s not the prize that&#8217;s at issue here! It&#8217;s the principle of the thing. We&#8217;d won, pure and simple. We followed the rules (despite Lark&#8217;s attempt at sabotage), and finished first. Why should we get penalized because another team had to wait for something out of their control?<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s just a game, Geoff, don&#8217;t take it so personally!&#8221;<br />
Yeah, yeah, I know. Considering all the things we had to, the excellent team building we had done, the &#8220;process&#8221; we&#8217;re supposed to be following (as a part of our jobs), and arriving first, all I wanted was to cheer our vistory. I couldn&#8217;t care less about winning anything. The fact that four Americans had to put their faith in a lone Canuck not to get them lost, come together as a team, and still complete the course before everyone else should garner the recognition. What else can I say? I got caught up in the competitivenes.<br />
Yeah, so this is my formal complaint. We won, darn it, and you can&#8217;t take that away from us. Take your fancy backpacks, I don&#8217;t care! (I have one, anyway.) I have the satisfaction that we are #1.<br />
Now before everyone thinks I&#8217;m too negative about all this, make no mistake: I had fun. A lot of fun. I would do it again in a second. It was planned wonderfully, executed brilliantly, and (outcome notwithstanding) an excellent idea for the event. I have to keep it in mind should I ever have to do this sort of thing again.<br />
But next time, I&#8217;m switching the envelopes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Every year, Critical Mass holds its annual holiday party. For the first two years of my employ, they were Christmas parties (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]); the two since then have both been New Year parties (see [[Critical Mass New Year Party 2003]] photos). I assume this is because scheduling things before Christmas is far more difficult. And really, it&#8217;s nice to have party that&#8217;s not heavily influenced by a holiday.<br />
Last year, we hung out at the Destination: Africa pavillion at the Zoo. A neat place, to be sure, but you can&#8217;t go to the same place twice in a row (if at all). So this year (and last night, to be specific), we opted for something different. It was a little more downplayed than last year &#8212; the Palomino Room at the Roundup Centre. Not exactly the Fairmont Palliser, but the venue wasn&#8217;t going to be the central point.<br />
Kristen and I arrived just as the event was beginning. We could have gone for the slightly more fashionably-late, but considering there was a hockey game and the motorcycle show both on that evening (not to mention other parties), I wanted to take advantage of the nearby parking at the office. Thankfully, we were not the first to show.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the theme of the evening was, but the focal point was money. As each person arrived, they were given an envelope that contained the ubiquitous drink tickets, and $20,000 in funny money for each person. (Kristen and I had a total of $40,000 between the two of us.) The funny money was for use at the gaming tables.<br />
The Lions Club provided the entertainment &#8212; several blackjack tables, a roulette table, and two other games that I really don&#8217;t know the name of, but generally don&#8217;t see outside of carnival midways. The idea of these tables was to turn your $20,000 into much more. This money would be used after the tables closed to bid on a wide range of prizes, including a carpet steamer, camera, kid&#8217;s play easel, coffee maker, power saw, and a monstrous George Foreman grill.<br />
We mingled near the door, getting a feel for the near-empty room. James bounded up from out of nowhere, already quite giddy. He, Scott, and Tyler were providing the music that evening, taking turns DJing. (I would believe their task to be wholly successful, but in discussing the aftermath with James earlier today, found that there were those who were less than impressed. To them, I can only feel pity, for not appreciating that these gentlemen volunteered their time. They sacrified their party time so that the rest would not suffer the consequences of the DJ we had last year.)<br />
James proceeded to note my demure behaviour, which while I did not take offense in, could not understand how he noticed so quickly, having only just arrived. We were then taken for a quick tour to the stage to view the setup for the evening. Most of what James said registered somewhere in the recesses of my mind, but only superficially &#8212; he was talking so fast I could barely understand him.<br />
Amy and Jen arrived soon thereafter, so the four of us (James remained on stage) took Table 15. We would be accompanied by Angie and Tyler, and Luke and Allison. With our things &#8220;stashed&#8221;, we proceeded to find out if we were lucky in cards.<br />
Neither Kristen or I had played blackjack before. And we were at a table with a dealer whose accent, unfortunately, was difficult to hear at times (over the music and other people). But we began to get the basics down. The principle is easy enough (closest to 21 without going over, and it&#8217;s the dealer vs. everyone else). For a while, we were up and down like yo-yos, before Kristen hit a big winning streak, which recovered all our lost funds, plus $1,000 &#8230; which was the smallest bill, by the way, so don&#8217;t think we were *that* successful.<br />
Dinner was called around 6:30 or so, which was an excuse to hit the lines. Of our table, we were the last to arrive. But at least the food was good. (Terri had warned me that Stampede Catering was not the best, so we apparently had tried to get another caterer. But only Stampede Catering will cater an event on the Stampede grounds.) Roast vegetables, potatoes, chicken, and a wonderful roast beef (with a wild mushroom gravy that I thought was wonderful). Hard to eat everything, though. Especially since we needed to save room for dessert.<br />
And were we glad we did. Now the chocolate wasn&#8217;t Bernard Callebaut (at least, I don&#8217;t believe it was), but it was still very tasty. The shocker for the night, however, was the baklava. Until last night, I wasn&#8217;t really a baklava fan. I&#8217;d had it before, but it hadn&#8217;t done anything for me. Kristen, however, could not get over how good it was. So I had to try. I was beside myself.<br />
I love chocolate. I mean, I *really* love chocolate. It&#8217;s one of my weaknesses. But this simple Greek pastry was like having someone open the door into a new world of taste experiences. I think the main ingredient was pure crack cocaine, because it was enough for Kristen and I to go back for seconds, thus eliminating the remainder of baklava from the table. (Yes, we were greedy. So sue me.)<br />
Following dinner, the gaming tables resumed with frenzy. Kristen and I tried our hands again at 21, only to find that our luck wasn&#8217;t as good as we&#8217;d thought. Finally, Kristen convinced me to try roulette &#8212; something Tamara would have loved, had she been able to come. I&#8217;d never played it before, though I knew the rules from having watched Tamara and Adrian on a couple of occassions.<br />
Like blackjack, roulette does involve some strategy, and you can do quite well, depending on how you place bets. Placing directly on the numbers the most risky, but has the highest payoff. Playing on the variations (colours, odd/even, number ranges) tends to reduce the risk. It took me a while to listen to my instinct and hope that we did well.<br />
I don&#8217;t know how much we were down when we started (we&#8217;d both had our clocks cleaned at the last blackjack table), but in the last spin of the roulette table before it closed, earned back enough money to have the original $40,000 restored. I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Several others did much better, going into the hundreds of thousands. But even that would not be enough for the bidding wars that were about to break out.<br />
With the gaming complete, the silent auction went into overdrive. The first table closed 30 minutes after gaming ended, so the bidding was fierce. The top price was $325,000 for the carpet cleaner. I was impressed &#8212; I didn&#8217;t think anyone could win so much. It was then that it dawned on us &#8230; not all the winnings were from one person.<br />
Pooling had begun. Deals were struck, begging was in full force. Eyes were locked on certain items, and the bids were rising fast. It was like watching an episode of &#8220;Survivor&#8221;. Soon, it was just the second table. Minimum bid? Somewhere around $200,000. Rumours of someone walking around with $5 million began to spread. False values were thrown around like rice at a wedding. Our paltry $40,000 was donated to the cause, so Luke could acquire the coffee maker of his dreams.<br />
Oddly enough, it would be the coffee maker that acquired the most attention, though for reasons I may never fully understand. In the waning seconds of the bidding, the war went to extremes, with people turning over huge sums of cash to a select few still engaged in the fight. When the ball dropped and the bidding closed, the final values were unbelievable. The coffee maker drew the biggest bid of the night, almost doubling that of the professional-looking George Foreman grill.<br />
Final bid: $1 million.<br />
All I can say is, that had better be one damn fine cup of coffee.<br />
The wars over and the dust settled, there were a few announcements, and James began his run at the turntables. Some people stayed at danced, some headed out. We stuck around for about 45 minutes or so, before we, too, headed out. Normally, I would shut the party down. For once, I wasn&#8217;t really upset about leaving early.<br />
It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what they can plan for next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is an Old Klingon proverb that says: &#8220;Revenge is a dish best served cold.&#8221;<br />
It is very cold in December. (Well, when we&#8217;re not chinooking, anyway.)<br />
Several months ago, I fell victim to an attack. Not a physical or verbal attack &#8212; a water balloon attack (see [[Critical Mass Reckless Summer Reunion]]). This was orchestrated by the Delichte brothers, Jason and Darren. (I&#8217;m still not sure how I became the focus of their attention. I&#8217;m not sure if I should be honoured or horrified.) I certainly owe them a special &#8220;thank you&#8221; for that particular event, and one day, when I find something appropriate, I shall.<br />
But first things first.<br />
The water balloon attack could not have been pulled off without inside information, namely my boss, Allard. As you know, I tend to carry cameras with me. The Delichtes made sure I was camera-free by having Allard make sure that my cameras were at a safe distance. He did it very well, too &#8212; I had no idea that I was being set up. At least not until a line of water bombers appeared on the hill above the volleyball courts.<br />
As the sayings go: One good turn deserves another; no good deed goes unpunished; eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth; wrong me, do I not revenge?<br />
For the last few months, I&#8217;ve been plotting and scheming, trying to think of something good to pull off. The trick, of course, is so that the person at the receiving end has no knowledge what is to befall them, yet can do nothing about it once it&#8217;s happened. Not as gruesome as Poe&#8217;s &#8220;The Cask of Amontillado&#8221;, but certainly something that when seen, will provoke the appropriate feeling of &#8220;he got me&#8221;.<br />
Such it was that in a moment of brilliance (or drunken stupidity, they&#8217;re pretty much interchangeable), it came to me. I would give Allard a nice, gift-wrapped present.<br />
His desk. And everything on it.<br />
I wish I could take credit for this little idea, but I must confess that Chris had mentioned it around the time we were replacing Teak&#8217;s files with several cubic feet of candy (see [[Revenge is Sweet]]). But no-one had acted on it around here, so it was left as a possibility. And with Allard taking a couple of days off for the Christmas holidays, I was presented with a prime opportunity for revenge.<br />
Yesterday, I made a little trip out to Costco, to acquire a few rolls of cheap(er) wrapping paper. I didn&#8217;t know exactly how much I&#8217;d need, but the desks aren&#8217;t that small (Allard has an end unit, which means vertical surfaces), and while his desk isn&#8217;t even remotely as cluttered as mine, there are still a number of things that require wrapping.<br />
I arrived at the office around 19:00. I needed to make sure that there was no-one else around on the second floor. My goal was to complete the task without anyone knowing who it was. I wanted the mystery effect to last at least a few days (Allard won&#8217;t be back until the 29th), and because Allard arrives so early in the morning (before most of the people on this floor), I wanted the effect to be seen before he &#8220;opened his gifts&#8221;.<br />
The first thing I did was take reference photographs. I needed to know (roughly) where everything was so I could put it back in a wrapped state. Then came the fun part: wrapping. I started with the aisle-facing side of his desk &#8212; it was the easiest thing to do, and a good place to start. It didn&#8217;t take long, but admittedly, didn&#8217;t really leave me with a sense of accomplishment. I still had a long way to go.<br />
I got bogged down in the details. The table legs are not straight cylinders &#8212; they are slightly arched, and taper quite a lot towards the top; the shelving racks are like blocky shovels, which do not wrap easily (or nicely). It was 21:45 when I came to the realization that I needed help, or be up all night.<br />
For the record, I would love to give credit where credit is due. I would love to stay who it was who loaned two hours of their time to my task, as strange (and draining) as it was. However, in the interests of preventing any form of retribution, they will remain nameless. But their help was invaluable, and definitely prevented me from staying too late. They left shortly before midnight.<br />
I continued working until everything had at least some wrapping paper around it: the desk, side table, filing cabinent, phone (wrapping the cord was no fun), the monitor and monitor stand, the laptop dock, the keyboard, mouse and mousepad, more books than should be allowed on a desk, the chair, the light post, and his nameplate.<br />
Everything was put back in the place it had been originally found. Cables were plugged back in. Ideally, everything should be exactly as it was before &#8230; just covered with wrapping paper. There are even bows on a few things. (I had toyed with using ribbon, but in retrospect, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a little more detail than I really care to think about.)<br />
Towards the end, admittedly, I was getting a little sloppy. My back was killing me, I was hot, tired, and desperately wanting to go to bed. But I finished, leaving the chair perhaps a little less wrapped than I would have liked. Around 1:45, I finally packed up my things, cleaned up the evidence, and made for home.<br />
I skipped gym this morning &#8212; I needed the rest. After the &#8220;workout&#8221; I&#8217;d had moving things around and wrapping, I figured I&#8217;d had enough exercise for a while. (Yeah, I&#8217;m stretching. I&#8217;ll do cardio all week to make up for it.)<br />
A couple of people were already in the office when I arrived. It didn&#8217;t take long for word to spread. People were taking notice. Even the less-than perfect wrapping job was being lauded. And if nothing else, the smiles have been worth all the time and money.<br />
After all, if you can&#8217;t get a good laugh out of revenge, why do it at all?<br />

<p>There are all sorts of smart things one can do on a school night. Getting drunk ain&#8217;t one of them.<br />
For those of you no longer in the scholastic world, a &#8220;school night&#8221; is no different than those you experienced at school. Basically, most weekday nights (not counting Friday) and Sunday night. So named because you have to get up early in the morning, file yourself off to a building, and concentrate on things that you might not otherwise like doing.<br />
For the last three days, I&#8217;ve been in all-day meetings. We&#8217;re planning out the 2004 projects for Mercedes-Benz. Now that I&#8217;m part of the lead team, I now participate in these meetings. They&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong. We sort out all sorts of issues and really get a good feel for the direction we want to take the account.<br />
But they are draining.<br />
It&#8217;s like having a Martian Brain Sucker attached to your skull all day. By the end of it, you&#8217;re exhausted. The advantage is that you feel really good about the work you&#8217;ve done. All in in all, it&#8217;s a good experience.<br />
&#8216;Course, the best part is the dinner that follow the last day. That&#8217;s when the MB team goes out for dinner. Well, &#8220;dinner&#8221; is a subjective term, since we eat a little and drink a lot. (The amount of drinking varies, usually inversely proportionate to how smart you are about when to stop.) But it&#8217;s all fun.<br />
To make things more interesting, I didn&#8217;t leave right at the end of the day. You see, irony of ironies, the site that I worked on directly (and for which we were having the dinner), MBUSA.com, was down. It had been down since about 11:00 that morning. All because of a database edit. A fairly simple thing, really, which is why we were so utterly puzzled when the &#8220;fix&#8221; didn&#8217;t work.<br />
When 17:00 rolled around, the fixing was still at full speed. I got the skinny on what was going on (I only knew during the day that there was a problem, but not exactly what it was) and tried to understand what part of the problem was. (There was a lot of Java discussion, which I don&#8217;t possess enough of an understanding to truly grasp.) In a nutshell, there wasn&#8217;t much I could do to help.<br />
So I went out to get drunk.<br />
Well, that wasn&#8217;t so much the intention so much as the result. And lest ye be thinking I&#8217;m turning into a raging alcoholic, please rest your fears. Now I know there are a number of stories that always seem to start: &#8220;So we went out to get drunk&#8230;&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not always the case. I don&#8217;t live my entire week like that &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t have made it 31 years if I did. Just that the drinking stories are usually the most fun.<br />
The Wildwood Pub is one of the nicer places in town to meet. It used to be a lot better. Sadly, as I found out last night, their beer quality has begun to sink dramatically. Peter, our newest copywriter, was telling me to avoid the stuff. I should have listened. Between Peter and myself, we tried every variety of beer they had (there&#8217;s only six or seven of &#8217;em). They were all bad. We both switched to Keith&#8217;s.<br />
I think I ended up being the only technology person in attendance. (Most of the others, sadly, were trapped at the office trying to resolve the site problem. The fix, in case you&#8217;re wondering, was to restore a previous backup of the database.) So I guess I felt a responsibility to represent. [Insert cliched reference to LA gangland-style comrades here.]<br />
That might have been what possessed me to drink beer a little too quickly. Either way, a good time was had. So good, in fact, that eventually, it was down to just five people: Dan (the Managing Director &#8212; the Big Kahuna, if you will), Mabel (Dan&#8217;s assistant), Jason (Project Manager), Daryl (Account Manager), and yours truly. That was when Mabel convinced us that we had to go somewhere else.<br />
We retreated to two cars: Mabel&#8217;s and Dan&#8217;s. I rode in Dan&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;d never been in a Mercedes-Benz before. (Hey, he *is* the Managing Director. He kind of has to own one.) It&#8217;s nice &#8230; the rear seats are brutally cold, but it is nice. Don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever own one, though.<br />
Mabel and Dan zig-zagged through Calgary. I&#8217;m not entirely sure I knew where they were going, but we eventually ended up at Mabel&#8217;s apartment, where she ditched her car. The five of us continued in Dan&#8217;s to our destination: Aussie Rules.<br />
Aussie Rules is an Australian bar. (Or at least, it&#8217;s supposed to be.) Now before you think that&#8217;s a little strange, here&#8217;s something else to make you scratch your head: It ain&#8217;t the only one in town. Yes, there is another one: The Flying Emu (okay, so technically, it should be a New Zealand bar), just down from my old apartment.<br />
So you think I&#8217;d see kangaroos, drink Foster&#8217;s, and eat barbecued shrimp, right? Nope. We listened to dueling pianos.<br />
Yes, dueling pianos. Perhaps one of the stranger things to see in a bar. Two pianos (baby grands), facing each other. Two player/singers. But it&#8217;s not a competition &#8212; they play together, banging out whatever songs people request (or whatever they feel like playing). Mabel led us to the table right in front of the stage so we could get the full effect.<br />
We came at an opportune time (which I can only assume was in the vicinity of midnight), as these guys had been playing (and drinking) for a couple of hours. They were definitely well into their silly stage. While they did play great music (they actually did a couple lines out of Gowan&#8217;s &#8220;A Criminal Mind&#8221; on a request I shouted out; they wouldn&#8217;t touch Gordon Lightfoot), they also did a pub favourite. This was Mabel&#8217;s request.<br />
At some point in your life, you&#8217;ve probably heard The Irish Rover&#8217;s &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221;. If you listen to it the way the Rovers do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is a very nice song. If you listen to the way the Dueling Pianos do it, &#8220;The Unicorn&#8221; is an Olympic event.<br />
When the request was made, one of the two pianists (a guy about 40 lbs overweight, I&#8217;d guess) climbed up on top of the piano (I assume it can easily handle the weight of someone on the lid), picked up a microphone, and hopped over to the top of the other piano, and prompted demanded everyone stand up.<br />
Incidentally, I assume they&#8217;ll only do this song after people have been drinking long enough.<br />
So here&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s all about a couple of the verses (here&#8217;s a link, <a href="http://www.irish-rovers.demon.co.uk/lyrics/unicorn.htm">in case you want to know what the lyrics actually are</a>), repeating the chorus often, making the audience mimic the animals mentioned in the chorus, and following the direction of the singer (for example, when he yells: &#8220;Where&#8217;s the bar?&#8221;, you point at the bar). If you manage to get to the end with all the motions without laughing yourself to the floor, you&#8217;ve done pretty well.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it. But I didn&#8217;t land on the floor.<br />
Anyway, without going into excrutiating detail (&#8216;cuz you know I could), we had a blast at Aussie Rules. Before we knew it, there was the Last Call. At the time, it didn&#8217;t really click with me what the time probably was. For some reason, I decided that whatever time it was, it wasn&#8217;t really that late. It didn&#8217;t feel that late.<br />
Time flies when you&#8217;re drunk.<br />
We upped and left (paying the bill, of course) and headed towards downtown, dropping Mabel off along the way. Then it was over to the Mercury, another Calgary establishment. I have no idea what time it was when we arrived. It couldn&#8217;t have been too late &#8212; the place was still serving. Dan decided we needed some Irish Whisky to finish off the night.<br />
Dan drove us home. I live somewhat close to Dan, but saved him the trip through Sunnyside by having him drop me off at 2nd Ave and Centre St. From there, it&#8217;s a 20 minute walk home, which I really needed. It gave me enough fresh air to remember to drink a couple glasses of water and take a couple Tylenol to stave off the inevitable hangover.<br />
Tamara had been home barely 30 minutes before I walked in. She laughed. I was a wreck, and she knew it. (Technically, I knew it too, but just wasn&#8217;t willing to acknowledge it.) I had the water, pills, quick run through the bathroom, and crawled into bed somewhere around 3:00.<br />
Well, I assume I crawled into bed. I don&#8217;t really remember that step, but since I woke up in there, that&#8217;s about as close an assumption as I can make. My alarm &#8212; Chris&#8217; stereo which clicks on at 5:20 playing the Tragically Hip&#8217;s &#8220;Music at Work&#8221; album (the entire thing &#8212; that&#8217;s over 45 minutes long) &#8212; didn&#8217;t wake me up. Not even remotely. I forgot to set my secondary alarm. Luckily, I have a backup.<br />
It&#8217;s furry, has four feet, and purrs. She also meows really loudly in the morning when she wants to be fed.<br />
At 7:37, I bolted out of bed in a bit of a panic, threw my head under the tap to get the bedhead down, dressed, shaved very quickly, ran a toothbrush across my teeth, and was in the process of about to run out the door when I realized Tamara was still asleep. We carpooled. I don&#8217;t drive to work usually, but considering we had to be at work for 8:00, I made an exception.<br />
The hangover kicked in around 8:30. And it got progressively worse all morning. The more I moved, the worse it got. Fortunately, nothing so serious that I was ready to &#8230; well, y&#8217;know, but I sucked back a few aspirin with ginger ale to try quieten the body. It wasn&#8217;t until I had a greasy lunch at A&amp;W that I started to feel normal again.<br />
Well, as normal as anyone can feel after mimicking a chimpanzee in a Australian bar in suburban Calgary at some ungodly hour of the night because I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for my own good.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Critical Mass is growing. We&#8217;re preparing for a (hoped) massive expansion, but also have organic growth to contend with.<br />
This is what led Critical Mass to have to hire a new Project Analyst. And luckily for me, it&#8217;s my friend Graham.<br />
You might remember Graham from a couple train chases, specifically my last hunt of 6060 (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]) and from the Inaugural Run of the CPR Empress (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It&#8217;s because of Graham&#8217;s ex-girlfriend that I met Graham while chasing 2816, because I looked a little lost. Since them, Graham and I have forged an interesting friendship, based mostly around trains.<br />
This means, of course, that I&#8217;m no longer the only train guy in the office. And some people here already know this. When Graham came for his first interview, Claude asked him about his hobbies, which included (of course) chasing trains. They asked if Graham knew me.<br />
Now this is where I got screwed. You see, Graham didn&#8217;t apply for this job because of me. I didn&#8217;t even know about it. Graham applied knowing that I work for Critical Mass. Because he wanted to get in on his own merit, he feined ignorance of me. If I&#8217;d had the chance to recommend him (and I would have), I could have received a $1,000 referral bonus.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
Either way, it&#8217;s all good. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see Graham more than I have in the past (which isn&#8217;t that much), but with him on the fourth floor and me on the second, it&#8217;s hard to say how much our paths will cross.<br />
And we have to be a little cautious. If both of us ever called in sick at once, the immediate assumption would be that we&#8217;re chasing trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are certainly worse ways to spend Friday the 13th. There are certainly more healthy ones. But when Critical Mass decides to throw a party for its employees, you can be sure of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lot of laughs.</li>
<li>There will be a lot of drunk people. (That kind of leads back to #1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I should point out, for the record, that the New Year party was extremely tame. I have no idea why specifically, but it was the first time I haven&#8217;t seen at least a few co-workers completely loaded.)<br />
Unlike last year&#8217;s little surprise (see [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]]), the staff knew that this party was coming. What they didn&#8217;t know was where it was going to be. There were many theories: Sylvan Lake, Calaway Park, Banff, even whitewater rafting. Most were discounted due to distance, cost, and safety. One location that had circulated a few times was COP &#8212; Canada Olympic Park. I assumed it would not be there, since I assumed (rather poorly) that there was little for us to do there. Little did I know&#8230;<br />
Our morning began a little earlier than usual. For me, it was with a little more responsibility &#8212; I had to take a staff photo. In the six years that Critical Mass has been in business, there has never been a staff photo. This was the first time since the Kelowna trip (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]) that we&#8217;ve had everyone in the same place at the same time.<br />
Since we laid six people off last week (including my roommate), we are without an &#8220;official&#8221; photographer. I guess I&#8217;m the next in line (can&#8217;t imagine why), so I was asked to take the picture. To allow this, Darrell (the VP of Operations) arranged for me to gain access to the roof of the next door building and shoot across the parking lot. Two great things about this: the angle is perfect, and the sun in the morning is great.<br />
The bad thing? Organizing that many staff is like herding cats. Which is why I was very happy to be just outside of comfortable shouting range.<br />
Pictures in hand, we boarded our busses for our unknown location (which we would soon find out was COP). We were grouped into five teams: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, White. (These are representative of the Olympic colours, of course.) This not only organizes us, but creates the groundwork for the competitive in-your-face attitudes that we generally lack in the office.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s a chance for us to completely mock each other.<br />
The line at the bar formed as soon as the busses arrived. It took less than a few minutes for us to be kicking back in the main tent, drinking our beverage of choice (usually one of Corona or Heineken), and getting into the groove of the day. Pat and I both remarked that in some ways, the day was reminicent of the Kelowna trip &#8212; starting the day off with beer.<br />
What I would find was that as the day went on, the more I felt like I was not in Calgary. The company had whisked us away to parts unknown to engage in a weekend of total debauchery. It wasn&#8217;t to the same scale as Kelowna (I&#8217;ll be very impressed if we ever see that again), but there was so much energy from having the entire day to do (pretty much) as we pleased that everyone seemed to forget that we were (at the core) just co-workers.<br />
We began our mini-Olympics around 10:00. The events were fairly simple, and none too difficult. (They were designed to be played by the dozen or so pregnant women currently at the office.) They included Bocce-Curling (get your ball the closest to the target), Cookie Stacking (stack Oreos as fast as you can in 30 seconds, using only one hand), Channelz (using five half-pipes, run a ball around an obstacle course, moving the ball from one channel to the next every 20 feet), Memory (remember what a bunch of articles are), and Balloon Toss (tossing a water balloon between two people, increasing the distance every throw).<br />
Oh, and there was one other event. As we arrived, 10 people volunteered for a &#8220;special event&#8221;. No-one knew what it was until it started: a Scavenger Hunt. A lot of people who didn&#8217;t volunteer wanted on, and a few who did volunteer wanted off. The details of the whole thing are still sketchy. We didn&#8217;t see the Hunters until just before lunch.<br />
Although I was part of Team Yellow, I spent most of my time running around between the various events, taking pictures. I gotta say: drinking beer and running don&#8217;t mix well at all.<br />
Participants were well-behaved. For about five minutes. I mean, come on! Put a bunch of people (mostly men, admittedly) in the vicinity of filled water balloons, and well, you&#8217;re gonna have some trouble. Suffice to say, every team that left the Balloon Toss went to their next event armed. It&#8217;s a good thing we had a sunny, warm day &#8212; a number of people got a wee bit damp. (Fortunately, our adolecently-minded staff had the decency not to aim water balloons at the women in white shirts.)<br />
Things calmed down a wee bit come lunchtime. That&#8217;s when everyone put their guns down and loaded up on food. (You&#8217;d be surprised how much acting like buffoons works up an appetite.) Nothing overly fancy &#8212; just hamburgers and salads.<br />
After lunch, we were left to our own devices. Some people went off wandering, some played mini-golf, and some went to play beach volleyball. The rest sat around and chatted. Resuming my photo run, I proceeded to find interesting things to take pictures of. For some reason, I started with beach volleyball.<br />
The five courts are wedged in the last curve of the bobsled/luge track. Unlike most of the other courts I&#8217;ve seen, these had more than the 2-3 inches that you end up driving your foot through into pavement. I took the opportunity to run around a bit and get a few action shots of people playing.<br />
My first memory card full, I took a moment to rest before heading back to get the second one. That&#8217;s when Ed suggested I come play with them. Still being inebriated enough not to know any better, I hopped out on the court.<br />
Now, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright idea on my part. My head (along with the rest of my body) was still swimming in ol&#8217; ethyl. The actions of volleyball &#8212; whipping the head around following the ball, diving, rolling, yelling &#8212; combine against your brain&#8217;s better judgement to stay in one place and lie down. Needless to say, it&#8217;s quite the argument my body got into.<br />
While in the midst of a set that I don&#8217;t really remember, I caught a glimpse of water balloons arcing over the trees. The angle required to get the balloons over the trees was so great that the balloons never came close to the courts. That didn&#8217;t stop me from annoucing (rather loudly) that if anyone hit my camera with one of those balloons, it would be the end of them.<br />
That statement would be my downfall.<br />
About 20 minutes later, Allard (my boss) caught us in between serves to borrow my little camera. Or rather, I thought that&#8217;s what he was looking for. In reality, he was checking to make sure I was camera-free. I hadn&#8217;t seen the audience on the hill carefully hiding my big camera.<br />
Next thing I know, there&#8217;s a line of people standing on the hill. They were in plain view. You know those old cowboy movies where the angry Indians all stand in a line at the top of a ridge? It was like that, only with water balloons. And no Indians.<br />
Somehow, instinctively, I knew to run. It didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; apparently, I&#8217;d earned the privilege of being the prime target. Two balloons bounced off me, but one made a direct hit in the front, followed moments later by one in the rear.<br />
Neil ran past. (Although he still claims his innocence, I have witnesses as to his involvement.) Picking up the two balloons, I chased him all over the courts. Then Neil got smart and stopped. Before I could do anything, he&#8217;d burst the balloon in my hand, and stepped on the other. Now balloon-less, there was only one other thing I could do: chase him.<br />
For all I know, I had a blood-curdling rebel yell as I chased Neil up the hill. Someone yelled out: &#8220;Tackle him! Go for the legs!&#8221; Remembering snippets of high school gym class, I dove and grabbed the legs. From what Arthur tells me, it was a textbook tackle. All I know is that the whole effort wore me out, and there&#8217;s no video evidence.<br />
I walked around damp for most of the afternoon (like I said, it&#8217;s a good thing it was warm), constantly shedding dried grass and sand from the escapade in the volleyball court. Although I can&#8217;t say I was the wettest that day, you could put me in the top rankings, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
The winners of the games were announced towards the end of the day. I wasn&#8217;t particularly paying attention, having reached what I can only assume was the bottom of my bottle, figuratively speaking. Team Green won, partly due to their skill (I can only assume) and subterfuge (which was widely known). Hey, it&#8217;s just a game&#8230;<br />
We returned to the office to begin the *second* event of the day. Thought we were over, didn&#8217;t you? Ha! If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s when to stop. Hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing&#8230;<br />
Vicious Circle was our next port of call. We didn&#8217;t all arrive at once, but before long a large portion of the company had packed themselves into a seat somewhere. And at Vicious Circle we sat, talked, drank, snacked, and took strange pictures of everyone who was there. And then suddenly, almost without warning, people began to filter out into the night.<br />
Torin, Adrian, Jim, and myself headed to Ceili&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not too sure why. We ran into a couple of people from CM, but after a quick search for anyone else in the building, we found outselves alone. This meant it was time to vacate. The problem, however, was that during our search, Jim decided it was time to get another beer. (For those of you who think *I* was far-gone, you needed to see Jim.) We didn&#8217;t much want to wait for Jim to finish his beer. No problem for him &#8212; he just slipped the 3/4-full pint into his pants pocket.<br />
Out the door and down Stephen Ave. &#8212; we were headed to SkyBar, where we knew the rest of the crew could be found. We didn&#8217;t get much further past Penny Lane when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: Sean, aka Muck, aka my cousin Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. Pam, of course, was right there. We talked briefly (the others were waiting for me, and I couldn&#8217;t very well wait around too long) before resuming our quest to SkyBar.<br />
When we reached 1st St., Jim disappeared. We were across the street from Murrietta&#8217;s, one of the cooler bars/clubs downtown. That night, they had a live band playing p-funk (basically, horn-driven music). Jim blurted something about it, and next thing we knew, he was gone. We waited around a couple of minutes, but Jim was gone. (James and I would discuss this the next day &#8212; James received two completely unintelligable voicemails from Jim over the course of the night.)<br />
Torin, Adrian, and I continued to SkyBar. There we ran into Cyndy, Ashifa, a couple of Marks, and other people I don&#8217;t quite remember now. SkyBar cover was $15. We weren&#8217;t objected to it so much as we were STARVING. Conveniently enough, Saltlik was next door. On the order for a late-night snack: a peppercorn steak.<br />
It was midnight when we hit the streets again. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, had at least that many beers over the course of the day, been water-bombed, run ragged, and my feet suddenly decided to tell me they were ready for revolt. As much as I would have liked to go up to SkyBar, my body cried out in defeat. It was time to go home.<br />
The lights were off, and nobody was home. (Except the cats, of course.) I assumed Tamara was out having her own breed of fun that night. For some reason, though, I felt the urge to look for a note. I found one on my computer keyboard: &#8220;Back in a few days. Enjoy your weekend!&#8221; I laughed, though probably more from being too tired. I crawled into bed next to Spaz, who was rather upset that I was making her move.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait for next year!<br />
