	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I found out this morning that I&#8217;m worth keeping. Needless to say, this is a big boost to not only my esteem, but also my ego.<br />
What&#8217;s all this stemming from? The Radical restructuring. Today will forever be known as &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221; within the walls here at Radical. Today will be an example of why we hate Disney.<br />
A couple of years ago, Radical negotiated a contract with ESPN, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Broadcast Corporation, who happens to be owned by Disney. We were making (and were in the process of making) games for ESPN Digital Games &#8212; a venture between us and ESPN. We had three: Hockey, basketball, and a snowboarding game.<br />
A couple of weeks ago, we got the bad news &#8212; Disney said &#8220;no&#8221;. We weren&#8217;t allowed to try a publish them. TRY. It was like talking to Yoda: &#8220;Do or do not, there is no try.&#8221; Someone (dunno who) believed we were incapable. We had been gearing up for publishing for quite a while (which is why we have an office in San Francisco, and are technically an American company, so investors won&#8217;t be spooked). Either way, it doesn&#8217;t matter &#8212; we aren&#8217;t doing jack with ESPN anymore.<br />
Unfortunately, ESPN was our major revenue stream. In other words, we&#8217;re screwed. And that&#8217;s what brought us to today. We&#8217;re closing the San Francisco office. We&#8217;ve released our CEO and CFO (much to the delight of everyone here). But we also had to release about 50 people here. That didn&#8217;t go over so well.<br />
We knew this was coming. We&#8217;ve known for a couple of weeks. It&#8217;s like walking on broken glass around here. You feel like there&#8217;s a sniper ready to take you out at a single command. Okay, *I* felt that way. Most of Pure3D is safe &#8212; they&#8217;re pretty bulletproof. Well, almost all of them.<br />
Greg James and Nenad Ukropina weren&#8217;t. I thought I was a goner, for sure. Resume ready to roll at a moment&#8217;s notice. Not that I wanted to leave, but I needed to be ready to bail if the plane started diving.<br />
Pure3D actually had private meetings to plan our escape, should things go really bad. Tim&#8217;s a Big Guy here &#8212; he knows almost everything. But even he sounded worried. (Either that, or he&#8217;s utter brilliant at getting us to think along safety lines.) We worked out a plan of attack &#8212; five of them, actually, Option A through Option E. These various plans went from things going according to plan, to Pure3D leaving as a team and going somewhere else (this was &#8220;Option D&#8221;, a running joke for several weeks before and after &#8220;Black Tuesday&#8221;), to casting off to the four winds.<br />
This morning, we were all called to the lounge for a short meeting. It was a short meeting. It went kinda like this:<br />
Management: Good morning. We&#8217;ll keep this short. We have to release about 50 people so that we can keep the company afloat.<br />
Us: (To ourselves) Oh boy&#8230;<br />
Management: When you return to your desks, some of you will have email. If you do, please return here with your personal effects immediately.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: You will have to turn in your keys and anything else that belongs to Radical. You will then be escorted from the building.<br />
Us: (Pure stunned silence.)<br />
Management: Thank you.<br />
You could have told us this would happen, and we wouldn&#8217;t have believed you. No way in a million years would we have guessed that this was how they were going to deal with the issue. It almost felt like Nazis had replaced our cool management team overnight with a bunch of assholes.<br />
Tim wasn&#8217;t in a good mood. I don&#8217;t blame him. He didn&#8217;t want to do what had to be done, and I know he didn&#8217;t like what had to be done. Radical did the only thing they could &#8212; remove the people before their anger did anything damaging. It was possible, though nothing seems to have happened &#8230; yet. The day&#8217;s long from over.<br />
Lunch will be an interesing one. I&#8217;m certain there will be talk. Mostly about Option D. We have no idea what&#8217;s going on, or what will happen in the coming days, let alone weeks and months. I think I&#8217;d better keep my parachute ready&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;d always thought that the &#8220;Welcome Wagon&#8221; was a euphemism for a group of well-natured people who would come to the door of folks new the the neighbourhood and welcome them into the community. Little did I know that Welcome Wagon is actually the name of a corporation that organises events and earns a profit (or so I assume &#8230; why else would a company have &#8220;Ltd.&#8221; as part of its name?).<br />
Welcome Wagon Ltd. organised a bridal show in Nanaimo on Sunday, and Allison&#8217;s mom thought it would be a good idea if we went over to see the show. Not so much to make arrangements (we&#8217;re still working on an actual date), but to get ideas for the ceremony and for the following reception.<br />
This meant we had to catch the 8:30 ferry from Horseshoe Bay, which meant we had to be up no later than 7:15. I crawled out of bed at 7:13. Allison followed at about 7:16. We were out of the apartment by 7:28, and the car had hit the road by 7:32. We arrived in Horseshoe Bay just after 8:00, where our next little fiasco took place &#8212; finding a place to park. This is the single hardest thing to do there, because parking is at an absolute minimum.<br />
The BC Ferries lot was full, that I expected. However, the nearby Impark yard was also full. I started to worry a little. But Allison knew of a lot over by the Boathouse. It was for Sewall&#8217;s Marina (it allowed no overnight parking as a result), but you could get a spot for the day, which it what we did. After I parked the car, I ran down to the machine to get a ticket. It was one of the older machines, which spat out a ticket at a time (for each $2.50 inserted). Ideally, it would do the same as the other machines I&#8217;ve used and let me pop in my VISA card.<br />
Nada.<br />
So I ran back to the car. I had made the mistake of wearing pants that morning, without dumping the financial contents of my shorts pocket first. (In other words, I had no change.) I got some change from Allison (which was a relief), bolted back down to the machine (the parking lot was on a hill), and tried to purchase three tickets. Except the stupid machine would only sell them using specific combinations of coins. I had only enough for two. So I had to run back up to the car, get another quarter, run back down to get a third ticket, and then run back up again. By this time, I was almost out of wind, and worried that if we didn&#8217;t hurry we&#8217;d miss the boat.<br />
Having not enough cash was a minor problem, so I ended up having to buy tickets with my VISA card. (At least that time it worked.) When we boarded the ship, we made a beeline for the cafeteria lineup. We were starving. BC Ferry food has a tremendous reputation for being horribly awful. We opted for the safest (and cheapest) thing on the menu that would see us through the day &#8212; a western croissant. The egg was at best egg-like, the croissant was like plastic &#8230; at least the hashbrowns were edible.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo just after 10:00, I came to notice something &#8230; my keys weren&#8217;t in my pocket. In fact, I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. Suddenly, I had a flash &#8212; in all that running back and forth to the machine, I had forgotten my car keys in my ignition. In my car. In Horseshoe Bay. On the other side of the Georgia Strait.<br />
I was suddenly not feeling so well. At some point, I need to sell my car. It&#8217;s costing me too much money to keep around, and if I can get a few thousand for it, then I can pay off most of my debt. But if someone stole it because I had mistakenly left my car keys in the ignition, then I would be severely screwed. Living away from home is sometimes not at all what it&#8217;s cracked up to be.<br />
Arriving at the Collins&#8217;, I made a hasty call to the West Vancouver Police, hoping that they might be able to do something &#8212; it would, after all, be crime prevention (not to mention idiot protection). But the constable I was speaking with suggested I call BCAA (the British Columbia Automobile Association). I thought it was a great idea. So I dialed the number, and explained it this way:<br />
BCAA: BCCA, how can I help you?<br />
Me: Hi! I did something really dumb &#8212; I just realised I locked my keys in the car.<br />
BCAA: No problem, we can get them out. Where&#8217;s your car?<br />
Me: Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.<br />
BCAA: Great! And are you with the car?<br />
Me: Well, there&#8217;s the problem.<br />
BCAA: Why?<br />
Me: I&#8217;m in Nanaimo. I just came in on the ferry.<br />
BCAA: And your keys are on the mainland&#8230;<br />
Me: Right.<br />
BCAA: Oh boy&#8230;<br />
There was the problem. BCAA required someone to be at the other end to hand the keys to (BCAA was not allowed to hang onto the keys). There&#8217;s a problem living here &#8212; I haven&#8217;t met many people, certainly a very small number whom I&#8217;d consider friends, and no-one I would consider good enough to drive all the way out to Horseshoe Bay to collect them. (Sometimes I really hate the fact that I left all my friends behind at home.) However, the BCAA operator thought that maybe the BCAA attendant could put the keys under the front seat. This was a great idea, in my opinion &#8212; Allison had a spare key we could get into the car with, and we&#8217;d be able to drive off with no problems. This was assuming, of course, that they could find my car. You see, I couldn&#8217;t tell them my license plate number &#8212; I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I knew my Ontario plate, but for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t remember my BC plate. So I had to give them a detailed description of the car. Luckily, there aren&#8217;t many cars in BC that look exactly like mine. That issue resolved, we sat down to eat before heading off to the bridal show.<br />
The show was at Beban Park, not far from the Collins&#8217;. Almost the entire show was arranged around the brides &#8212; there was almost no acknowledgement whatsoever of the fact that men even existed and were part of the process. Allison and I had a long discussion about this later on. It boils down to the wedding industry (and believe me, there is a very strong industry out there) brainwashing women to having extravagant weddings costing thousands of dollars. Allison had originally hoped to do the whole thing for $500. I knew that it would cost us about $2,000 and that&#8217;s about where we&#8217;re budgetting.<br />
We were there for research. Each table added another idea to the pot of things that we had to consider for our wedding. The biggest thing on my list was decoration. Although it is wonderful that we can get a hall in Nanaimo for a very low price (i.e. nothing), it&#8217;s not exactly the most attractive place. So I took the time to look at photographs and look at the displays to determine what we could do. That&#8217;s not to say that I wasn&#8217;t looking at anything else &#8212; I scribbled about three pages worth of notes, varying from wedding invitations to colour schemes.<br />
I was feeling horrible during most of the show. I&#8217;m convinced the eggs I ate on the ferry were making me feel ill. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling all that great either. And two fashion shows of women&#8217;s gowns was putting me out like a light. Even the overly-loud music wasn&#8217;t doing me any good.<br />
During the various raffles, Allison won a ring-bearer&#8217;s pillow. This little event changed our plans a little, and we thought we might end up using it. However, it would necessitate a few changes to our plans. At first, we thought having one of Allison&#8217;s little cousins would be a neat idea &#8230; then we scrapped it, remembering the financial input required for such a detail. The pillow would remain unused.<br />
I had thought that after the show, we&#8217;d head back to the ferry and we&#8217;d go home. But the Collins wanted to have dinner with us, especially since the Vailette&#8217;s (Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents) wanted to see us. (They had expected us the day before and had a small reception waiting for our arrival.) We dined on vegetarian lasagna (quite tasty, mushrooms aside), with a delightful cake for dessert. Allison and I had to then run for the ferry.<br />
Most of the way back, I kept hoping that my car would still be there when we arrived. I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to the prospect of having to deal with the police and ICBC to report a stolen car. As we entered the parking lot, I couldn&#8217;t see where my car was &#8212; a large white van blocked my view. But as I rounded the van, I was ecstatic to see my car in place. As expected, the keys were under the front seat.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you should get a BCAA membership &#8212; for those times when you&#8217;re hopelessly screwed, and you desperately need help. If you never use it, you might curse the expense &#8230; but the moment you need it, you&#8217;ll thank your lucky stars that you bought it. I consider mine well paid for.<br />
I grabbed my keys, popped them in the ignition, and &#8230; nothing happened. In all the running around, I had forgotten to also turn off my headlights. The battery was stone dead. Off I went again, running around to find someone with jumper cables or who could let me borrow their phone to raise BCAA again (the stupid 800 number doesn&#8217;t work in the lower mainland and I didn&#8217;t have a quarter to make the call).<br />
I lucked out with The Boathouse, a seafood restaurant at the foot of the parking lot. There I found a very kind waitress (originally from Saskatchewan) who offered to give us a boost. I was appreciative beyond words. A few minutes later, the car was running and we were on our way home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As some (or all) of you know, Allison and I got engaged during our trip to New York<!--(see Volume 6)-->. While we&#8217;ve told nearly everyone we know, we haven&#8217;t told everyone yet. More importantly, we haven&#8217;t set a date yet. There is a reason for this: Allison&#8217;s rather extensive family. In total, I have to deal with 19 people. That&#8217;s including my immediate family, my uncles, my aunts, and my cousins. Oh, and Nana, of course. Allison, on the other hand, has something on the order of 70 people in her family.<br />
We went out to Nanaimo for the weekend to visit with the Collins&#8217;, and so we could start working on the finer details of controlled mayhem. This included looking at several community halls, hotels, bed and breakfast inns, resorts, and so forth. We did find the places where we&#8217;ll most likely spend our honeymoon (we ain&#8217;t going to Hawaii, that&#8217;s for sure), but we had problems deciding where to hold everything.<br />
Our biggest problem, so we found out later, was food. We have about 130 people on a list (including significant others, if they exist). Even we if manage to whittle the cost of food down to a measly $10 a head, that still works out to $1300 in food alone. And then we&#8217;ve got the cost of the rentals, the clothes, the flowers (an extra, in my opinion, but apparently it&#8217;s unavoidable), the justice of the peace, bla bla bla. It&#8217;s going to be an expensive proposition.<br />
Upon our arrival, we went almost directly to the Wellington Community Hall. This building has been around for several decades, and has seen many events trapse through its rooms. Because Allison is part of the community, and her parents helped build and maintain the building, we stood a very good chance at getting the hall for nothing. And that would certainly help with the mounting costs of getting hitched.<br />
The next day, we looked through several different places to hold receptions, have people stay, and even hold the ceremony. (This was after we went to Costco to get Allison a membership and have lunch.) Most of the places we were interested in were up in Lantzville, Parksville, and Qualicum, all north of Nanaimo. Although all them were interesting, the single biggest problem I had was that for most (if not all) of my friends and relatives, these places were far out of their way unless they had a car. I knew that in nearly every case, cars would not really be an option.<br />
When we returned to Nanaimo, the Collins&#8217; took Allison and I to Fast Eddie&#8217;s for dinner. It&#8217;s a quasi-50&#8217;s diner-style restaurant. There we managed to totally stuff ourselves. It would probably be the last time I eat out for a while.<br />
That evening, we started solidifying a list of all the people we had to invite. It was then the distressing news of a huge food bill began to show up. Allison had been hoping to have the entire thing for only $500, something I had to admit I was a little surprised at. But she had been thinking very practically &#8212; a large pot-luck. Although I had no objection to that per se, I felt a little guilty because the burden would then be placed on her side of the family.<br />
This wedding is off to a slow start. We&#8217;ve got a lot of planning to do, and we have to start setting a date soon. And the number of people on the list will likely change a lot over the next few months. It&#8217;s too bad we couldn&#8217;t just run down to Las Vegas and get this all done with&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Summer has begun its slow end &#8212; the Pacific National Exhibition opened this weekend. I can only assume that its Toronto counterpart, the Canadian National Exhibition, also started this weekend. As back home in Ontario, the opening of the PNE is a reminder that the summer is much shorter than we all think.<br />
Allison and woke up Saturday morning, and decided that we would go to the opening day of the PNE. I had never been to the opening day of the Ex (CNE) in Toronto, let alone even been to the PNE, so I thought it would make for an interesting day.<br />
Following our brunch of breakfast burritos (scrambled eggs, black bean salsa, and some cheddar cheese wrapped up in a tortilla shell), we headed out for the Shopper&#8217;s Drug Mart. We understood we could buy passes there to the PNE. As it turned out we could only buy passes to Playland, which is the amusement park portion to the fair &#8212; and it was a lot more expensive than we thought.<br />
Nevertheless, we boarded the Skytrain to the 29th Avenue station, and took the PNE Express bus to the fair. When we got to the gate, we found that instead of buying the standard $6 ticket, we could buy a $15 dollar ticket that would get us into Cirque Parasol, a Cirque du Soliel rip-off. (There are a few of these roaming about, all trying to get their own pieces of the pie.) Thinking that this was a good idea, we put out the extra cash, and wandered in.<br />
Our first stop was the farm show, or more specifically, the farm animals. This is the last remaining part of the agricultural beginnings behind the PNE (the CNE in Toronto has a similar background). We viewed the endless lines of cows, goats, sheep, llamas (yes, llamas), chickens, and so forth. Unlike previous years (in Toronto, that is), this excursion began to bother me. I realised that all the animals in the barns were destined for a future in the slaughterhouse.<br />
Perhaps it&#8217;s conditioning from having lived here, and been exposed to a more left-wing environment (Ontarioans don&#8217;t think twice about things like this). But eating vast quantities of meat (particularly red meat) actually begin to make me feel a bit ill.<br />
Exiting the animal show, we began to wander about the fair grounds. Although we had bought tickets to Playland (the amusement park portion of the PNE), we opted not to go on it that day, preferring to look about the PNE itself. We caught a showing of Superdogs, a staged show put on by Technikal (a dog food manufacturer), which sends pooches of all sizes down a runway and over a wall (made of hollow plastic tubes, just in case the dog doesn&#8217;t make it). It&#8217;s the most popular thing to see at the PNE.<br />
After venturing around most of the PNE grounds, we went into the Dream Home. Every year, for about 80 years or so, the PNE has had a Dream Home contest. You buy tickets to attempt to win an amazing home, containing every luxury one can think of. This is the house I want. When we come back the next time, I intend to buy enough tickets to win it.<br />
Shortly thereafter, we had dinner at the smokiest place in the PNE &#8212; the barbecue chicken stand. A bad idea. Following dinner, we headed over to Cirque Parasol. It was an amazing show, considering we paid only $9 for it. It was hardly to the calibre of Cirque du Soleil (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]), but it was still pretty good.<br />
When we got out of the show, it was almost 9:30, and time for Chilliwack to play. Chilliwack is one of a hundred Canadian bands that probably never would have hit it big without the Canadian Content rule imposed by the CRTC. Without that rule, I never would have heard of Chilliwack, let alone remember over half the songs we heard. It was kinda eerie.<br />
Following the concert was a fireworks display. Compared to the Symphony of Fire, it was pathetic. But it was much longer than the Canada Day fireworks display. That was annoying. It wasn&#8217;t well organised, and it had no lead-up to the end before finishing by setting off every last firework they had. Following the works, it was time to go home and rest.<br />
The following morning, we had to go pick up my mother and grandmother (whom I refer to as Nana) from the airport. They were coming in to take a cruise out of Vancouver and up through Alaska. We rose a little later than I had hoped, and very hastily cleaned the apartment. Then we hauled out the door, and headed for Richmond. I figured we would be a little late. We more than likely saw mom&#8217;s plane land, followed shortly thereafter by Nana&#8217;s.<br />
When we arrived at the airport, they weren&#8217;t there. Allison and I hunted through the arrival lounge without being able to spot them. Of course, there was a reason for this. First of all, mom arrived through a different gate, and wound up in a different area to accept her luggage. Nana required assistance getting off the plane (she has had her hip and one of her knees replaced, so she doesn&#8217;t get around very easily anymore), and took a bit longer to arrive. Allison and I forgot to mention that we had been late in arriving&#8230;<br />
After picking up their luggage, we headed back to the car and out of the airport. We stopped in at the Milestone&#8217;s restaurant on No. 3 Road in Richmond for brunch/lunch/whatever. There we had a long talk about just about anything, but mostly how home was, how other relatives were, and so forth. Following lunch, it was time to show them where we lived.<br />
This was somewhat worrisome for me. You see, there is only one bed in the apartment. I hoped that Nana wouldn&#8217;t be offended or anything like that. Luckily, she wasn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
The conversation resumed, and we started discussing other matters. Then I found out, much to my horror, that my Uncle David had sold the cottage in Waskesiu. I was completely shocked and crestfallen. Although he did sell it to an old family friend that we could probably borrow it from, the luxury of just going was now gone. I felt like a part of my childhood had been ripped away. I had so looked forward to going back, but now that was a distant dream.<br />
Finally, we jumped back in the car and took them down to the Pan Pacific Hotel. We found out, much to our chagrin, that we could not yet check them into their room, because the room wasn&#8217;t ready yet. So we took a voucher for free drinks and sat in the lounge for a while, watching cruise ships depart and sail out of the harbour.<br />
When the room became available, we went upstairs and relaxed their for a while. It was a huge room, surpassing the size of our apartment. We watched a few more cruise ships exit the harbour (they all enter in the mornings) and listened to Enya on the in-suite stereo. After an hour or so, we opted for dinner.<br />
The in-house restaurants weren&#8217;t exactly cheap, but they weren&#8217;t over-priced either. Besides, neither Allison or I were paying. The conversation, as you can guess, continued. We talked all through dinner and dessert, until finally it was time to call it a night. Mom was three hours ahead of us, and exhausted. Nana wasn&#8217;t too far off from falling asleep either. We bid them a good night and a safe trip, and went home &#8230; after being robbed when we paid the unbelieveably high prices for the parking.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend just passsed was the BC Day long weekend (for those of you back in Ontario, that&#8217;s a fancy way of naming the Civic Holiday) &#8212; we get the first monday in August off to enjoy the weather and get out a little more than we usually do. We took the opportunity to visit my relatives in Kelowna.<br />
I dropped Allison at work on Friday morning, on the intention to pick her up Friday afternoon so we could leave Vancouver immediately. This didn&#8217;t work exactly to plan, because Allison ended up starving all day due to lack of money with which to buy lunch. We ended up postponing our departure until after we&#8217;d eaten.<br />
Then it was down Knight St. in Richmond to the 99 East, under the intention to cross the Annacis Island bridge, down to Highway 10, turning to Highway 1, finally ending at Route 1 (aka the Trans-Canada Highway). The only problem was that I missed the turn-off for the bridge, thus setting us back about 10 minutes. (And after all the problems I had with Los Angeles a week earlier, I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly good about it.)<br />
Route 1 was packed in a few places with morons slowing down traffic for no good reason (like there&#8217;s such a thing as a good reason), but soon we were whistling our way east. After an hour or so, Allison and I had to stop to make use of a washroom. Regretibly, there were no washrooms available &#8230; we had to make use of the local foliage to disguise ourselves.<br />
Climbing back into the car, I glanced at the fuel gauge &#8230; it was at less than 1/8 of a tank. I had left with over half a tank, thinking that it would be enough for the trip. I had never driven my car through the mountains before, and I was beginning to think that my car was going to be a little more trouble than I would have liked.<br />
By the time we arrived at the Coquihalla Toll booth, I was worried. My stomach was knotted, and I really didn&#8217;t want to hear what Allison would say if we had run out of gas. Fortunately, I do have BCAA (the BC version of AAA), but when you&#8217;re stuck in the middle of nowhere and your significant other is breathing fire, you really can&#8217;t defend yourself with a tiny piece of plastic.<br />
I asked the toll attendant where the nearest gas station was, foolishly assuming there would be one nearby. &#8220;Lessee, that would probably be Merritt, about 16 kilometres away.&#8221;  That is what I heard. This is not quite what she said. I figured out what she said a few minutes later, when I saw a sign that said: Merritt 62km.<br />
I about had a heart attack. Allison was going to kill me if I ran out of gas. For the next 45 minutes, I used every trick in the book to keep from running out of fuel: Travelling at 90km/h, shifting into neutral when going downhill (periodically running the risk of getting a speeding ticket at the same time), and not slamming my foot on the gas pedal. I breathed a very audible sigh of relief when we arrived in Merritt under our own power.<br />
Allison was annoyed that I hadn&#8217;t told her, but she was quick to point out that it was a no-win scenario for me &#8212; she would&#8217;ve been peeved no matter what had happened, so I got lucky in that she was only annoyed, and not ready to deprive me the ability to reproduce.<br />
After fuelling up, we stopped at the A&amp;W so we could get something to drink (we were thirsty) and so I could call Aunt Alaine and Uncle Dave and let them know we were running late. They didn&#8217;t seem too surprised, and I told them we&#8217;d be about an hour and a half late. They seemed to concur with that estimate.<br />
We arrived at their door about 23:30 that evening. Already in the driveway were Uncle Dave&#8217;s car complete with the boat on a trailer, and Uncle Mike&#8217;s truck with the camper trailer behind it. We squeezed into the last space remaining, and quietly got out.<br />
Our arrival was not unnoticed &#8212; Maggie, the Znack&#8217;s (Uncle Mike, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jennifer) dalmation, began a barking fit as I passed. This woke Uncle Mike, but not Jennifer (strangely enough). Brenda was somewhere in the house.<br />
The next day we started off with a big breakfast, and then opted for an excursion down to the launching ramp to put the boat in the water. When we arrived at the ramp, we found that most of the boating population of Kelowna had done the same. It turned out that the most popular place to view the Thunderboat races (which were the thing to see that weekend) was on the water.<br />
As we waited to launch the boat, Allison decided it was time for Jennifer and I to bond. She got Jennifer to tickle me. Yes, I&#8217;m ticklish. Jennifer loved it. Frankly, so did I, if for only one reason: I got to know Jennifer as a result. Jennifer was born in 1989, thus making her 17 years younger than myself. (This isn&#8217;t the fault of her parents, but considering Aunt Brenda is about 14 years younger than my mother, it does explain a few things.) Every time I had seen Jennifer before, she was either too shy, or I was too wrapped up with other things to really get to know her. I thought this was great, personally. I get along very well with all my cousins, so getting to know Jennifer better was a definite asset.<br />
Finally, we got to launch the boat. Not a huge event, but rather important before you can go out on the lake. It was then I found out that we were to go for a ride. This presented a problem &#8212; Allison doesn&#8217;t like small boats. She gets seasick rather easily. I offered to take the car back, which is the best thing we could do. I figured that even the trip back to the beach near the Tisdale&#8217;s (Uncle Dave and Aunt Alaine) would be troublesome for Allison, and I wasn&#8217;t really interested in pushing her luck. Dave handed me his keys and told me to take the car back.<br />
I thought to myself: &#8220;Well, at least now we can see how Geoff can drive with a trailer.&#8221; No problem, I thought. I can handle it. When we arrived at the car, we had a smaller problem &#8230; I noticed that where there should be a shifter for the automatic transmission, there was in fact a shifter for the manual transmission. I had never really driven with a manual before. I had always wanted to learn, but the opportunity had never really presented itself.<br />
Well, all things considered, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Yes, I did stall the car a couple of times when I tried to get going, but it was (so I found out later) because what I thought was first gear was actually third. (The shifter in Volvos apparently ain&#8217;t so great.) We managed to arrive back at the Tisdale&#8217;s in one piece, and with the transmission intact.<br />
There we found out that the rest of the troupe, save for Nana (my mother&#8217;s mother), had also gone out. The dictate was: Be at the launch for 14:00. Allison and I took the opportunity to get a few things that Allison needed. The first thing was contact lens cleaner, which apparently had emptied itself that morning. The second thing was Gravol. Allison was going to make an attempt to go boating.<br />
Despite the cola she had drank to counter the extreme drowsiness brought on by the Gravol, Allison had a hard time staying away. But finally, we got onto the boat, and took a trip out into the lake. Lake Okanagan is quite warm, and shallow in many places. But it is deep in others &#8212; the bridge crossing the narrow part of the lake is so deep that it wasn&#8217;t feasible to build concrete supports into the lakebed. As a result, the middle portion of the bridge floats.<br />
That evening, we had barbecued tiger prawns. I&#8217;ve become accustomed to eating prawns now, and can usually stomach them if there is no alternative. But don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ll still order something else if I have the option.<br />
The following day, Allison and I opted not to travel around Kelowna with my relatives, but instead decided to travel down to Penticton to visit with Allison&#8217;s friend Kelly (whom I knew). Although Kelly lived in the lower mainland (about 30-45 minutes from our apartment), bad timing had prevented us from all getting together for a long time.<br />
The plan was to travel down the canal that runs from Penticton a few miles south. You pay $10, they give you an innertube and they pick you up at the other end. However, there was a minor problem on this fine (and hot) day: The water level was too low. This meant we could only go half the length we could normally have gone. The three of us discussed this, then decided that this was not such a good idea. So we spent the afternoon at the beach instead.<br />
When Allison and I returned to Kelowna, we didn&#8217;t immediately return to the Tisdales. Instead, we went to check out a planned community called Kettle Valley. It was amazing. The houses looked just like the ones I had wanted to own for years. The prices weren&#8217;t all that bad, at least when compared to Vancouver.<br />
That evening, we had a vertible feast back at the Tisdale compound. Mike and Brenda had brought a rather large chunk of beef from Alberta, which was roasted to utter perfection on the barbecue. To match the meal, we had glasses of Okanagan valley wine, which had completely won over Uncle Dave (this is an important detail, because until that point he had only liked a specific brand of French wine). Dinner was fabulous.<br />
The following day was our departure. After another huge breakfast, we made a somewhat hasty exit &#8212; we were the first out of the driveway (the Znacks and Nana were also leaving), but I doubt we were the first out of Kelowna. Allison and I dawdled about Kettle Valley a bit longer, and then through the city, stopping briefly to pick up some aspirin to tackle Allison&#8217;s earache.<br />
By the time we arrived in Merritt, we were ready for lunch. We didn&#8217;t want to eat at a fast food restaurant, so we tried the ABC Country Restaurant (part of the ABC Family Restaurant chain). After a wait that even Godot would have been amazed at, we finally got our at-best-mediocre food.<br />
We effectively lost and hour and a half eating lunch. We were now at a disadvantage for arriving in the lower mainland ahead of the traffic. We hopped back on the Coquihalla, and I headed south, hoping to beat the pack.<br />
After a couple of hours, Allison needed to pull over for a while. She was on the sunny side of the car, and was beginning to develop heat stroke. At one of the places where the Coquihalla River passes under the highway that bears its name, we stopped for a rest. We climbed down to the river to play a while in its cool waters. There we wasted even more time building a small dam from the available rocks to create a wading pool.<br />
By the time we reached Hope, we had lost all hope of making it without the traffic. Allison was not in a good mood as a result of the heat, and I was getting a little annoyed myself. So we ended up leaving the Coquihalla and drove north on Highway 9 in search of Highway 7 (otherwise known as the Lougheed Highway), which would take us within spitting distance of our apartment.<br />
Allison was convinced this was not such a great idea, but I had a little more faith in the general stupidity of others. Aside from a backing up of traffic where Highway 7 and 9 met, the flow was smooth and non-stop right to Willingdon Rd., which we took south to get home.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="https://geoff.sowrey.org/1998/07/birthday-pacific-starlight/" rel="bookmark">My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, for those of you who know me, is my birthday. For those of you who don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re excused. (Just keep in mind that you now know, and I expect to hear from you next year.)<br />
Today was also day from hell.<br />
Aside from the fact that it was uncharacteristically hot and muggy, it was also the second-to-last day to complete the work I had for the H-Spline group prior to their trip to Siggraph in Orlando. In other words, I hit the floor running at 07:05 this morning, and I haven&#8217;t stopped since. I am in a wee bit of pain, and I&#8217;m really tired.<br />
Upon getting to work, I quickly started writing the remaining parts of the documentation (beta release, we&#8217;re still a ways from finishing the thing) before I was brought before the Almighty Dave (Forsey, the brain behind the H-Splines). Then I shifted work to working on the copy for the Rodin (the name of our 3D Studio MAX plugin) brochure.<br />
Just before 16:00, I bolted out the front door, trying to get to the Skytrain as quickly as possible. Allison had told me not to be any later than 16:50, when she was going to pick me up. I don&#8217;t know what it was that she had in mind, but whatever it was, I expected it to be interesting, to say the least.<br />
I got home, doused myself with cold water (in a vain attempt to cool myself off enough to put on some nicer (and inherently warmer) clothes. I shaved, dressed, and bolted downstairs to meet Allison.<br />
Then she took me to North Vancouver, and still not telling me where we were going, pulled into the BC Rail passenger parking lot. This was my present. No, not the parking lot &#8230; and evening on the Pacific Starlight.<br />
Several years ago, BC Rail started purchasing vintage railcars (I think the most recently built car was from the 50&#8217;s), and overhauled them to function as dining cars. Then they pack a few hundred people on, and take you for a ride up the line to Porteau Cove. The train reverses direction, and goes back down the line.<br />
After a quick sprint to a Shell station to get some money, we boarded the train and took our seats. Allison impressed me highly by firmly believing that if your going to spend money, spend it well &#8212; she got the best seats on the train.<br />
The train departed from the station about 18:30, and slowly moved westward through BC Rail&#8217;s yard. Allison thought it a little strange that the yard was considered one of the features of the trip, but for rail buffs (such as I consider myself), this is as good a feature as any.<br />
We passed by the building that houses the Royal Hudson and the 3716, which are two steam engines BC Rail uses for hauling passengers and tourists to Squamish and back. It&#8217;s a trip I&#8217;d like to take some day. (I have a thing for steam trains, ever since riding my first as a little kid &#8230; the CN 6060, which ran between Toronto and Niagara Falls. It now rests at the Alberta Pioneer Railway in Edmonton.)<br />
We passed under the Lions Gate Bridge, and entered West Vancouver. Many people on the train probably thought it very strange that so many homes (especially expensive ones &#8212; West Vancouver is noted for its very high property prices) boardered on the rails. Apparently, when the PGR was bought up by BC Rail, they had let the line go into disrepair. During that time, many homeowners were told (usually by real estate agents) that they could use the land on the rails. In the mid-70&#8217;s, however, BC Rail employees came along and told them otherwise. Many were not pleased.<br />
Today, that&#8217;s an entirely different issue. The number of people who waved at us as we passed was very surprising &#8230; I had to actually wonder what these people did with their time &#8212; waiting for trains to pass by?<br />
We wound our way along the line towards Horseshoe Bay, moving at a relatively slow pace. There were three reasons for which I thought of for the slow speed, but only two seem really appropriate: reducing the motion of the cars so people could eat, and so people can see the view.<br />
And what a view. Wow. I mean that. Wow. It was amazing. It was such a relaxing trip, that I almost didn&#8217;t notice the lack of foot room under the table.<br />
We sat at a table with a slightly older couple, Ian and Yvonne, who were celebrating their first wedding anniversary together. We talked a little (mostly on the way back) about everything, including the trip Allison and I are going on tomorrow.<br />
The dinner was absolutely sumptuous. Allison had conned me earlier in the month into telling her what I would like to eat. In fact, the entire present was one big charade (I have to give Allison full credit for being completely devious), but I haven&#8217;t the least bit of a grudge for it. We both had a salmon dinner, which to date is the best fish I have ever had in my life.<br />
When we arrived at Porteau Cove, we found (much to our surprise) that the jazz band that had sent us off in North Vancouver had beaten us there (which in all reality wasn&#8217;t that hard &#8212; the train moved that slow) and was still playing when we arrived. Very classy, non?<br />
We had a 45 minute layover (for us to stretch our legs, and so the nicotine addicts could get their fix), so we wandered about a bit, looked at Porteau Cove Provincial Park (it&#8217;s a lot smaller than it sounds), and then wandered back to the train.<br />
The trip back has us facing backwards (passengers are guaranteed to face forward during one half of the trip), but it was no less spectacular. We had dessert, which was a chocolate mousse-like (albeit much denser) quasi-cake, the name of which I completely forget.<br />
Upon arrival back in North Vancouver, we returned to Allison&#8217;s car, and headed for home to finish packing and get ready to leave on our next great journey.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last Wednesday (1 July 1998), I celebrated my first Canada Day outside of Ontario. Until that day, I had always had the luxury of being in the same time zone (and twice being in the same city) as the National Canada Day celebration. I will say one thing &#8212; the celebrations out here just don&#8217;t come close to what Ottawa puts on show.<br />
Allison and I rose late that morning, opting to catch some extra sleep. We then tried to figure out what it was that we wanted to do. Both of us had the day off, but with nothing particular in mind, we decided for a three-fold attack: IKEA, Canada Place, and Granville Island.<br />
The first stop was IKEA, where we bought a few things that we needed around the house (a couple of picture frames, a second set of dishes, and a few kitchen utensils), and ate a quick lunch.<br />
Then it was off to Canada Place to find some Canada Day cheer and celebration. It didn&#8217;t take long to find it &#8212; our first indication was a formation of World War II fighters buzzing the Burrard Inlet, laying smoke trails with each pass.<br />
We walked right down to the hotel lobby, and wandered inside. While we were in there, we noticed a sign on the wall for the Canada Day celebrations. As tradition held, a large number of new immigrants were sworn in every July 1, and that day was no exception. Following the ceremony was a long list of performers. One in particular caught my eye&#8230;<br />
Lee Aaron.<br />
That&#8217;s right, Lee Aaron, Canada&#8217;s &#8220;Metal Queen&#8221; from the late 80&#8217;s. I hadn&#8217;t heard anything out of her in years, and I had periodically wondered what had happened to her (usually when listening to furnaceface&#8217;s &#8220;Ballad of Richard Iomi&#8221;). Allison and I thought we&#8217;d stop in and see if we recognised any of the songs she played.<br />
One thing that I noticed right away as being odd: Her band was introduced as the &#8220;Swinging Barflies&#8221;.<br />
It seems that Canada&#8217;s <em>former</em> &#8220;Metal Queen&#8221; now sings swing. It was, shall we say, a rather major change in her style. A rather discomforting change. We didn&#8217;t stay too long.<br />
We went outside and started wandering down the pier (Canada Place normally functions as a dock for cruise ships). Along the way, we looked at some of the little presentations that had been set up. Allison (and I) found it very annoying that there was almost no uniquely Canadian presentation. We found a Mexican marachi band (who were almost completely drowned out by the singing swarm of Latin Americans surrounding them), and a Carribbean steel-drum band. Several food stalls, almost none of which featured a &#8220;Canadian&#8221; dish.<br />
Aside from the RCMP demonstrations (nothing as fancy as the vaulted &#8220;Musical Ride&#8221;) and the infamous &#8220;Beaver Tails&#8221; (which, concidentally enough, the last time I had one was with Allison when we were in Ottawa four years ago), there was almost no Canadian identity floating around. It was a little annoying, but I reminded myself that Canada isn&#8217;t a melting pot, and we do our best to showcase each culture as best we can.<br />
I still would have liked to see something made from maple syrup though&#8230;<br />
Afterwards, we went down to Granville Island to get something for dinner. It was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be, but the traffic was still worse than usual. We didn&#8217;t stay long, just enough to buy some chicken, pork chops, and vegetables. Then it was off to home.<br />
As we were making dinner, we made plans to meet with Tyler, and Mike and Michelle downtown to see the fireworks that night. It was a simple little process that we would have to change a little as we went along.<br />
All the walking we had done that day had done a number on Allison&#8217;s feet, and she had a blister on her foot that could make most people break down in tears. So we ended up changing plans, and meeting the other three downtown.<br />
No sooner than we had run into the three of them than I noticed something missing &#8230; my car keys. They were still in the ignition in my car. I ended up having to jog back to my car (Mike came along for the fun of it, so it seemed) to retrieve them.<br />
The fireworks were nothing overly spectacular &#8212; the Symphony of Fire is much more impressive. But all things considered, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. On the way back towards our car, we ran into an old friend of Allison and Tylers &#8212; John Paul (known as JP). JP dragged the lot of us into the Hotel Vancouver for over-priced drinks. Allison and I didn&#8217;t get home until almost 02:00.<br />
Late on 980705, I passed an important mark in my new life &#8212; I have now been in British Columbia for six months. I can&#8217;t believe that so short a time has passed since my arrival &#8230; all the things that I&#8217;ve done, all the things I&#8217;ve seen, all the things I still want to do, and it&#8217;s only been six months.<br />
Of course, it&#8217;s been six months of me being without friends or family. It&#8217;s pretty rough at times. Allison&#8217;s the world to me, but even she can&#8217;t make up for my closest friends. There&#8217;s just something about the way people who know me. After the barbecue Allison and I went to on the weekend, though, things might change later in the future. But that&#8217;s yet to be seen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I severed the last vestages that tied me to my birthplace. This morning, I went to the local CAA chapter (known as BCAA), and turned in my car&#8217;s license plates. I thus separated myself from the suit-and-tie ideals of Toronto, and became fully enveloped by the sandal-wearing hedonism that thrive here on the west coast. I guess I am truly now a British Columbian.<br />
On the weekend, Allison&#8217;s parents came out to the Lower Mainland for Father&#8217;s Day. Originally, Allison and I were going to Vancouver, but Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well enough to travel, so her parents offered to come over.<br />
They came over Saturday morning, which was when we had decided we were going to make a couple of purchases. We got up early (for a Saturday morning after a Friday night where we stayed up late cleaning up) and headed to IKEA and Home Depot. The idea was to purchase a table and chair set (which IKEA sold for a surprisingly low $229) and a barbecue. We needed both, since we were currently using Allison&#8217;s card table for a dinner table (and while it was a nice card table, it wasn&#8217;t terribly strong), and, well, hey &#8212; everyone needs a barbecue!<br />
But it took us too long. I ended up having to drop off Allison at the Patterson SkyTrain station so she could meet her parents downtown, while I took our newly-gotten booty home and into our apartment, followed up by a very hasty shower and shave.<br />
I was five minutes late getting downtown, something I owed to the plethora of red lights I kept hitting on the way.<br />
We went to Granville Island, home of the freshest food available in the Lower Mainland. We bought all the food that would go into our dinner (after having a quick bite to eat), and returned to our apartment.<br />
I decided that it might be a good idea to put the table, chairs, and barbecue together, since I didn&#8217;t really feel like eating at 21:00. As I began to piece together the table, Allison&#8217;s father sat down next to me and began to help. At first I was about to shoo him away, telling him to spend time with his family, but I quickly realised that I was going to need some help.<br />
The table was a snap, we had it assembled in a few moments. The chairs took a bit longer (and it didn&#8217;t help any that I got two chairs assembled incorrectly), but soon were usable. The big problem was the barbecue. Bad instructions (Step #3 should have been explained before Step #1) led to a longer job. But soon it was perched on the balcony, awaiting a full gas tank to bring it to life.<br />
Having wasted most of an afternoon putting things together, I suggested that we go outside for some air. Allison suggested that we go to Burnaby Lake, which we hadn&#8217;t been to before.<br />
This was considerably harder than it sounds, especially when we didn&#8217;t know exactly where it was. (I know, I know &#8212; how to you not see a lake?) We ended up almost in Coquitlam before we realised that we&#8217;d missed it. So we broke out the map (which was in the trunk, which is why we didn&#8217;t look at it right away) and followed some rudamentary directions.<br />
It turns out that Burnaby Lake is a protected lake &#8212; no-one&#8217;s allowed to swim in it, and the only place you can really get near the lake is at the rowing course that was built a few decades ago. It was the first time that I had seen lilypads in more years than I could possibly remember, let alone count. It&#8217;s about a kilometre long and about 300 metres wide, and ringed completely with marsh. Only the centre of the lake is exposed, which is where the rowing course is.<br />
After that, we decided to hunt down Deer Lake, which is a slightly smaller, but more publicly accessible lake. (It&#8217;s rather interesting that both lakes are within 20 minutes of our apartment.) The area around Deer Lake is a park, and has some very interesting and very expensive buildings surrounding it. I don&#8217;t even want to know what the property prices are.<br />
After visiting Deer Lake, we filled the new propane tank and returned to the apartment to have dinner. This was slightly more difficult than I had originally hoped &#8230; I couldn&#8217;t connect the tank. It seems that a couple of years ago, the Canadian Propane Monopolies decided that they weren&#8217;t making enough money, and changed the attachments for the propane tanks. This, of course, required you to either get a new barbecue, or get a $20 piece of metal that would allow you to attach your tank to your barbecue. I&#8217;m still annoyed that no-one at Home Depot warned me. Argh.<br />
So Mr. Collins and I had to make another run to the nearest Home Depot to pick up an adapter to allow us to cook dinner. By the time we returned, dinner was ready to go on. After dinner, we watched Toy Story, which neither of Allison&#8217;s parents had seen before. I still don&#8217;t know if they really liked it or not.<br />
The next day, we went to Horseshoe Bay to drop off Allison&#8217;s parents at the ferry. We had lunch at Troll&#8217;s, a local legend and location of the best fish and chips I&#8217;ve had. After dropping off Mr. and Mrs. Collins, I convinced Allison that we should go to Whistler. Neither of us had been there before, and it sounded like fun.<br />
A lot of people complain about out-of-province drivers. &#8220;They go so fast!&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re dangerous!&#8221; Let me tell you something &#8212; all the cars tearing up and down those twisting mountain highways were bearing BC license plates. There was the odd out-of-province. And, brother, those were some of the most psychopathic drivers I&#8217;d ever seen. And whoever that moron in the red Dodge Pickup, license BE 5889 &#8212; if I catch you pulling the same shit you were with me, I&#8217;ll have your license revoked permanently!<br />
Anyway, Whister was nice. Creepily nice. And clean. Deathly clean. In fact, it reminded me a lot of Colorado Springs (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Thunderstorms, Kansas, and Colorado Springs]]). I figured that it was the tourist dollars being put to use keeping the city clean.<br />
It&#8217;s expensive there, though. A two-bedroom apartment sells for at least $200,000. Condos are worse. Especially if you&#8217;re near one of the ski-lifts. The clothes weren&#8217;t cheap either, but then again, this is one of BC&#8217;s biggest tourist destinations. So I guess it goes without saying that the prices will be higher.<br />
Following dinner at the Olde Spaghetti Factory, we headed home to Vancouver. Both of us had to be up the next morning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last Sunday (7 June 1998), we finished moving Allison out of her basement suite, and into my apartment. This was for a few reasons: First and foremost, Allison was going in for exploratory surgery, and wanted to recupperate in a more comfortable environment (her basement suite was a little too cozy for her liking); I also wanted her to move in with me so we could be closer together (we were spending large amounts of time and money getting back and forth between our places), and hopefully save some money through less expensive rent.<br />
We had to go back to her apartment to quickly clean it out (her landlords were pressuring her to make sure it was spotless, despite the fact that they had no legal right to do so), and so we could meet with Tyler, one of Allison&#8217;s best friends. When we finished, we made a quick dash back to my apartment (and the ensuing disaster area that we created moving things around), where I quickly took care of a shower &#8212; I smelled like something had died and rubbed itself all over my body.<br />
We left short thereafter, to go to an Indian restaurant at Main and 49th, in Vancouver. Allison owed Tyler a birthday dinner, which she was determined to give him at some point. Following the dinner, we would quickly return to Metrotown to catch a showing of &#8220;The Truman Show&#8221;.<br />
Dinner itself was uneventful (my butter chicken wasn&#8217;t bad, but after a while, I found it not settling with me too well), but fun. We left the restaurant with about 20 minutes to spare before the movie was to begin, but we had a long way to go. We piled back in the car, and I started driving towards the first major intersection (I had to turn around, but it was difficult on such a major road). I drove as far as 51st, before I realised that I was a fair distance from where I wanted to be. I decided a short jaunt down 51st to Fraser would be in my better interests. That was my first mistake.<br />
I drove east along 51st a bit faster than I would have liked, but slower than the speed limit (the road had a lot of cars, but we were in a bit of a hurry). I glanced ahead of me to make sure that there were no stop signs to slow me down, passing intersection after intersection. That was my second mistake.<br />
Why a mistake? What I didn&#8217;t notice is that there were no street signs at all. The entire neighbourhood was full of uncontrolled intersections, which I quickly found out about when I was hit by a BMW. The first thing I thought of was: &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; The second thing was: &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to make the movie.&#8221;<br />
Luckily, no-one was injured, but my car sustained a fair bit of damage &#8212; the front fender was bent, and as I found out later, the right right wheel was knocked out of alignment, and bent in at the top. I think the shock was also ruined, but I&#8217;m not sure. The BMW sustained scratches (at least from a cursory inspection).<br />
While Tyler attempted to get the police on his cell phone, the other driver and I swapped information. After about 15 minutes or so of waiting, we gave up and decided to leave. (BC law allows us to do so, as there were no injuries.) Tyler kept telling me to let him off and he&#8217;d take a bus, but I felt so bad about dragging him out and putting him into an accident, I wanted to make it up to him. In retrospect, I guess he didn&#8217;t want to be in the same car as a driver who had just been in an accident. Can&#8217;t blame him.<br />
I make it as far as the McDonald&#8217;s on SW Marine before I realised there was something seriously wrong with the steering. The fender I didn&#8217;t care about. But the steering was a whole other issue. It was then I realised that things were rapidly going downhill.<br />
The following day, Allison went in for surgery. I drove Allison&#8217;s car, so I could pick her and her mother up from the hospital. Allison was groggy from the anaesthesia, and I was still feeling a little strange about driving, so I took the trip home very delicately. Once we got in, Allison asked me to pick a few things up for her from the store.<br />
On my way back, I thought I should stop into the Autoplan broker, and find out what my insurance would be. I had just lost my good driver&#8217;s standing, so I needed to know how much I&#8217;d be paying. They gave me an estimate of $2,300. I nearly choked. I was paying less than half of that in Ontario. It seemed that the accident was going to hang like a dark cloud over my head.<br />
On Wednesday, I took the car into North Vancouver, to a recommended auto body repair shop. The man who looked at it (an immigrant from New Zealand, or so it sounded) suggested a different shop just down the road. I went in, had the car checked &#8230; $1,500. Mind you, that was after the shop foreman found out I had insurance. Otherwise, I&#8217;d have been in big trouble.<br />
I later found out that the BMW somehow got about $1,100 in damage. From scratches. I hate expensive cars.<br />
The rest of the week was pretty stressful, as was the weekend following. But those were for reasons I&#8217;m not getting into here. But the end result had me beginning to wonder if I really wanted to live here. I&#8217;m so far away from my friends and family, and I don&#8217;t find that I&#8217;m really being accepted here. I want to leave, I want to go away and not come back. I want to sell off all my stuff and run for the hills. The only think keeping me here, for now, is Allison.</p>

		<p>The fallout from the round of layoffs a week and a half ago came to a rather disappointing end &#8212; one of our lead programmers decided he didn&#8217;t want to work for corporate America, and quit. Just as the game he was working on entered the final development stages. I still can&#8217;t believe that the Powers That Be could not see that coming. I suspect that Rory and Ian (the two driving forces of the company) predicted something like this would happen, but the final decision came from the States. Convenient that they don&#8217;t really have anything to do with this office.<br />
Then Marketting (also located in San Francisco) decided to get into the act. Earlier in the week, a couple of press releases got around about the deal Radical has with ESPN (we&#8217;re making video games for them). One of our investors, who writes a column for BC Technology, decided he&#8217;d start spewing out to the entire planet about the neat things we were doing.<br />
Problem: No-one was supposed to know until today.<br />
So Marketting decided they&#8217;d send around a message that pointed us at a rather heavily made-up internal website that warned employees about talking to the press. (They didn&#8217;t mention a thing about boneheaded investors.) That was mildy degrading. Two days later, we received the hard copies. Four-colour print on expensive-feeling paper. One copy for each person. Nice waste of money, especially so close to layoffs, eh?<br />
It turns out that the flyers were approved and printed before the financial crunch, but I still think that the idea to hand them around was extremely poor. Many people in San Francisco wonder if all of Vancouver hates them. I can safely say we don&#8217;t hate all of them &#8230; just selected people.<br />
Onto different things&#8230;<br />
I got out this weekend. I had originally decided to go out and get a haircut. I haven&#8217;t had a haircut in about three months, so it&#8217;s looking a little scraggly. (I don&#8217;t buy into the ol&#8217; &#8220;haircut every four weeks&#8221; baloney &#8212; that&#8217;s a ploy by the hairdressers of the world to make more money. Same applies for showering daily, which is really only needed unless you&#8217;re dirty or you smell bad.)<br />
Didn&#8217;t make it that far. Allison immediately suggested that we could go to White Rock. Having read a little about it, and not having been there yet, I thought it a good idea. So we hopped in my car, and took off in the general direction of the former resort town.<br />
Finding it was another issue. Although I knew approximately where White Rock was, I had no idea exactly how to get there. Neither did Allison, although she had a much better idea of where it was. We drove across the Knight St. bridge, and drove through Richmond. We eventually found ourselves in Delta, trying to find out way into Surrey. (White Rock is at the south end of Surrey.) Once we entered Surrey, I decided that it would be a good idea to get a roadmap. (Hey, I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who drives aimlessly for hours without asking where I&#8217;m going.)<br />
About 45 minutes or so after leaving home, we found the main drag in White Rock. We drove along for a short distance, and pulled into a parking lot at the side of the road. You could tell we were in a tourist trap &#8212; the parking cost a dollar an hour.<br />
We crossed the railway tracks (Burlington Northern runs a line between White Rock&#8217;s building and beach, a left-over from the heady days of being a resort town, I suspect) and walked towards the wharf, about a kilometre away. (We could have parked closer to the wharf, but we didn&#8217;t know exactly where we were.)<br />
Along the way, we ran into the White Rock, from which the town received its name. It&#8217;s a large boulder of white granite, an erratic left over from the days of the glaciers. Since White Rock was founded, the boulder has received a few coats of white paint, usually from the local graduates.<br />
The wharf (pier, boardwalk, whatever you want to call it) extends into Shemiamoo Bay about a half kilometre or so. At the end are a lot of people fishing, but mostly crabbing (throwing in crab cages and attempting to catch dinner).<br />
We wandered back through the town for a while, before I darted back to retrieve the car. (The parking meter was running low, and Allison&#8217;s new shoes weren&#8217;t exactly co-operating with her feet.) When I returned, I was met with a freight train that rolled along the tracks, (presumably) heading towards Vancouver.<br />
We stopped for a quick snack at an ice cream shop, and took a moment to relax somewhat (we had walked quite a while that morning). Having had our fill of White Rock (it doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; White Rock&#8217;s is quite small), we opted to travel further west along the shore.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Point Roberts. If you follow the western shoreline of Delta south, you pass by Tsawwassen, a major ferry terminal, just before you reach the 49th Parallel, and the end of Canada. But right at that point isn&#8217;t the end of the land &#8212; it actually goes just a bit further south, and into the United States.<br />
In 1854, after many years of arguments between the United States and Britain (who held domain on the western side of the Dominion of Canada), the border was extended across the 49th Parallel until it reached the Georgia Strait, where it dipped slightly to accomodate Fort Victoria, at the south end of Vancouver Island. Originally, the Americans had wanted the border to allow them access right up the coast to Alaska (then-President Polk was elected on the slogan &#8220;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&#8221;), but eventually the Americans and the British agreed on the treaty of 1827, setting the border at the 49th Parallel. Because Point Roberts wasn&#8217;t on the oceans, it became cut off from Canada.<br />
But you&#8217;d never know. Pretty much the entire 4.9 square mile peninsula caters to Canadian interests. There are many beach homes (which sell for as little as US$50,000), and the area is almost completely undeveloped. But most amenities are available, and some of the municipal services (water, hospital) come from neighbouring Canada. The grocery stores take Canadian money with no question. And due to the relative tight security (you have to go through a border crossing when entering and exiting Point Roberts), the crime rate is also very low.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long. Just enough to buy some cheap cheese, and fill up on cheap American gas. We thought we might even stay for dinner, but Point Roberts isn&#8217;t exactly known for its good food. We headed home, but ended up in Richmond to eat at Antonio&#8217;s, a tasty pasta bar.<br />
On Sunday, Allison and I made a quick spin of Metrotown, so we could obtain some free shorts, and peruse the haircutting establishments (none of which I was at all thrilled with). I then pretty much resigned myself to cleaning up my apartment. Having acquired some furniture from IKEA earlier in the week, I was determined to try and clean up my apartment a little.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this is my first crack at a proper Branch entry. Hopefully these will go as well as I hope they do&#8230;<br />
My weekend got off to a bit of a rocky start &#8212; my company laid off 12 people in our Vancouver office. The CEO and CFO of our company (both from our San Francisco office) came up to inform us of the situation. The two driving forces of the company, Ian and Rory (the guys, who IMHO are the men behind the curtain) broke the bad news, and the CEO and CFO put the spin on it.<br />
Now I know why I didn&#8217;t like working for Corporate America &#8212; the spin. I hate spin. I like hard, cold, unsugared facts. I have to give Rory and Ian their credit &#8212; they know their staff well. The CEO on the other hand, well, he needs to be here a little more often to understand us, I guess. All I know is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought his presentation was a little too slick.<br />
On Friday, Allison and I decided we&#8217;d head to Nanaimo for the long weekend. Allison had not been home since our last excursion at Easter, and wanted to go home for a short while. I, too, wanted to go, because it would allow me to get out of the city for a brief period of time. (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says &#8212; a change of scenery is a must from time to time.<br />
Allison picked me up at the office just after 12:00 on Friday afternoon. Our first destination was Granville Island, so we could visit the market. Our plan was to bring over all the goodies needed to have a good west coast barbecue.<br />
Following a brief lunch, we looked around at the various shops. We purchased vegetables (asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), fruit (strawberries), bread (sourdough), salmon steaks wild sockeye), and a bottle of a not-too-dry white wine. The whole shebang came out to around $40. (The salmon and wine accounted for most of the cost.)<br />
By the time we left, we found we would be hard-pressed to get to the ferry at Tsawassen in time. So we opted for the Horseshoe Bay ferry. One minor problem: We weren&#8217;t the only ones with that idea.<br />
By the time we got to Burrard, the street was backed up. It took over 10 minutes to crawl a few measly blocks. Georgia was even worse &#8212; traffic was solid for several blocks. But when we finally cleared the entrance to Stanley Park, the flow began to speed up. However, it was already 14:10, and we had to be at the ferry no later than 14:40 &#8230; if we were lucky enough to find parking.<br />
We had not been able to beat the rush to the long weekend, which was clearly evident by the very long lineup for the ferry. It looked like a three or four sailing wait for some people. Since Allison and I were aiming to be walk-ons, we were able to scoot down into Horseshoe Bay to look for a parking lot. Luck shone on us that day &#8212; we got one of the last spots.<br />
Despite some communication problems, we managed to contact Allison&#8217;s parents. They picked us up at the ferry, and we went to the Collins&#8217; for dinner. Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t started to make dinner yet. It was barbecue night.<br />
The next day, Allison and I thought we&#8217;d do some driving. Mrs. Collins suggested Cathedral Grove, which is a rather famous patch of old-growth forest near the very middle of the Island. Mr. Collins thought Coombs would be a nice stop along the way. Mrs. Collins then started to tell Allison about the new interchanges in the area &#8230; then promptly decided that the four of us should go on the trip. I had no objections.<br />
We stopped along the way at Rathtrevor beach, so I could see what a good tidal beach looked like. I don&#8217;t know how far out that beach went, but it looked like a half-kilometre. At high tide, the beach would completely vanish. All I could think was that the beach would be immense fun in the summer.<br />
We proceeded north to Parksville, where we turned onto the Port Alberni Highway, and headed west. Not too far from Parksville, we entered Coombs, a little town in the Island interior. Coombs probably used to be nothing more than a mining or logging town. Today it has a thriving little tourist business, formed around the Coombs market. What&#8217;s so special about the market? It&#8217;s not every day you see a sod roof with real goats parading about.<br />
Soon we entered Cathedral Grove. It&#8217;s a provincial park that was created from land donated by H.R. MacMillian, a forester who founded HR MacMillian (part of MacMillian-Blodel industries, if I&#8217;m not mistaken). Yes, Her-mac (as one call it) is a logging company. Sounds a little weird for a founder of a company that has come under a lot of fire for logging old growth-trees to donate a small forest of old-growth trees for parkland, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, Mr. MacMillan was apparently a nice guy, and wanted the future to know what the past looked like. Public outcry also forwarded the cause.<br />
Cathedral Grove is aptly named &#8212; I have never in my life seen trees so large. But even trees so large are not immune to the environment. On Jan. 1, 1997, there was a tremendous windstorm that tore through the grove. It knocked over several trees and thousands of branches. Several parts of the forest floor were complete littered with timber. But none of it was cleaned out &#8212; the park is to remain almost completely untouched.<br />
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Coombs, to shop at the market, and look around. It&#8217;s a nice little market &#8230; with a few hundred people packed in. But it&#8217;s worth the drive &#8230; at least, I thought it was worth the drive.<br />
We had a late lunch in the restaurant, and wandered through the multitude of wares in the market. (Oddly enough, most of the wares were Mexican &#8230; a little strange, IMHO, considering the Native influences in BC.) I purchased two very large Mexican hand-woven blankets (which are really warm). Allison bought a handful of paper mache vegetables for decoration.<br />
Returning home, we sat down to the task of making dinner. But even then, we didn&#8217;t eat until 20:00 or so. I offered to try and fix Mrs. Collins&#8217; email problems on her computer. She&#8217;d been having problems with the addressbook, and having multiple copies of Netscape floating around.<br />
The next day we rose early to go see the Victoria Day Parade. The Victoria Day Parade is a big thing out here. Few places in Ontario (only Ottawa comes to mind, and apparently Orillia also carries on the tradition) have a formal parade. In Ontario, the Victoria Day Weekend is more commonly known as the &#8220;May Two-Four&#8221; (the weekend was traditionally around May 24th, and a case of 24 beers is known as a &#8220;two-four&#8221;). It&#8217;s essentially the start of the cottage season in Ontario.<br />
We arrived downtown at about 10:40, expecting the parade to start at 11:00 (which was what we were led to believe). However, we noticed that there were still a lot of cars on the parade route, not all the reviewing stands had been completed, and we were the only people standing around. Mr. Collins soon found out that we had come too early &#8212; the parade didn&#8217;t start until 13:00.<br />
So we went wandering down on the waterfront. It was a nice day, albeit a little chilly from the wind. The weekend had brought a small amusement park to the waterfront (where just attractions appear during festive weekends). We had a batch of less-than-satisfactory french fries (they left a horrible taste in my mouth, and neither Allison or I were feeling too good as a result).<br />
At about 12:45, we headed back to the road to see the parade. When we arrived, the crowds that I had been expecting had appeared. Just after 13:00, the first sign of the parade went by &#8212; a fire truck. I had forgotten what community parades were like. It had been so long since my last one.<br />
I found out after the weekend that one of my co-workers, Greg Mayer, had been on the Hungarian Cultural float (it won for best Cultural Presentation, and Best Presentation Overall). We had somehow managed not to see each other.<br />
We had to hurry back to the Collins&#8217; to go to a family barbecue with Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents. We were sidetracked temporarily at home. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and had to lie down for a while before continuing out again.<br />
The barbecue was great &#8212; Mrs. Collins had made a potato salad that was exactly like the one my mother makes. It was like being at home. We ate until there was no food left to eat, and then ate some more. Dessert was a berry mix on a sponge cake, with whipped cream. Very tasty. Mostly considering that until this weekend, I didn&#8217;t eat berries. Things just keep changing&#8230;<br />
After dinner, we went inside where Allison and I watched the last episode of Murphy Brown. It was sad to see such a good show go, but it was a good last episode. Between Murphy Brown and the X-Files (which came on later), we went into the kitchen to make &#8220;stamps&#8221;. These were pieces of paper that you stamped with ink, and then sprinkled a special glitter overtop. Using a heater, you melted the glitter to make the stamp. It was fun. I won a prize.<br />
Then the final episode of the X-Files came on. Well, the final one that was filmed in Vancouver, anyway. (For we Canucks, it might as well be the final one.) I felt bad because I pretty much had the entire family in the living room watching a show that really didn&#8217;t seem to appeal to anyone. It was only a plot-builder for the movie being released this summer.<br />
Following the movie, the Collins and I made a hasty retreat back to the waterfront to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, we were late in arriving, and the fireworks had already started. As a result, we didn&#8217;t get out of the car. On the bright side though, we managed to be the first car out of there, and missed all the traffic. I felt bad again for making everyone miss the start of the fireworks.<br />
I tried to amend for my selfishness by buying coffee (and hot chocolate) and donuts (and muffins) for the Collins on our way back home.<br />
The next day, the weather couldn&#8217;t make up its mind. It was either rainy or somewhat sunny &#8212; there was no comfortable medium. We left late in the afternoon, catching the 16:30 ferry from Departure Bay. For those of you who know the ferry schedule, yes, that is not a standard ferry time. Extra ferries were running to cope with the traffic.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once again, I&#8217;ve left writing too long, and probably forgotten details of the events of my life. So if I forget anything, I apologise in advance&#8230;<br />
A couple of weeks ago, I decided it was high time that I started taking matters in my own hand &#8230; namely, I needed some exercise. I wasn&#8217;t getting out enough, and I was really afraid that I&#8217;d lose my figure. So it was time to start biking.<br />
My goal was to bike to and from work every day, rain or shine. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the only person &#8212; a good portion of Vancouverites engage in such activity, and it&#8217;s so popular at Radical, that we even have a dedicated bike storage room. (And having showers available certainly entices one all the more.)<br />
Some of you may remember that I made such a boast last year, when I said I would bike from Oakville to Toronto every day. Poor pathetic me didn&#8217;t realise just how far away Toronto was. I biked once, then left my bike there for about two months before bringing it home.<br />
But I said things would be different this time. So one evening, I ventured down to the locker room, pulled out my bike, and straightened out the handlebars (they were turned sideways when it was shipped out).<br />
The following morning, I make my first attempt to bike to work. I went across Grange to where it connected with Kingsway, briefly over to Boundary, and then proceeded north on Boundary to Adanac, which was the bikeway. It took me at least 15 minutes to get to Adanac.<br />
Despite the fact that a large portion of the trip to Adanac was downhill, I was wiped by the time I got there. I couldn&#8217;t believe how out of shape I was. And I still had to cross the city of Vancouver. I proceeded along Adanac, and felt ill to my stomach&#8230;<br />
The only bright point was that I had a shower waiting for me. And I really needed it too! When I went home that night, I went by MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop) to buy a new backpack. The one I have is for hiking, and is completely ill-suited for the purposes of biking. Similarly, my nylon briefcase is painful to wear for that length of time.<br />
When I resumed my riding the next morning, I found a new expression of pain in the saddlesores I had acquired. One does not get a full appreciation of how hilly it is here until one has to bike it.<br />
However, I persevered, to the point where I dragged Allison out on the Saturday for a bike ride around Stanley Park. Oh wow&#8230; I knew that Stanley Park was nice, but I didn&#8217;t think it was *that* nice. For all the reasons that I hated leaving Ontario, the ability to bike around Stanley Park outweighs a large chunk of them.<br />
That night, we went out with one of Allison&#8217;s friends (Rhona-Mae), who was leaving for home (High River, AB) the following day. We went to the Blarney Stone, where we wanted to throttle the doorman for not letting us in for almost an hour. Stupid nightclub politics&#8230;<br />
The following week was Hell Week for me &#8212; my group was putting out a new version of our 3D rendering system, and I had a lot of stuff to document. It was not a nice week at all. This culminated in a couple of nights where I got very little sleep. In one night, I slept about an hour. The next night I ended up sleeping at the office because I was behind in my deadlines.<br />
Allison and I are looking forward to the weekend. Unlike the infamous May Two-Four weekend in Ontario, we just have various festivals. We&#8217;re going to Nanaimo for the weekend, and a slew of barbecues. Ought to be fun&#8230;<br />
Yesterday, my work got flipped on its ear for a little while. I was happily working away, when I received a phone call. At first, I thought it was going to be Allison (we were planning to go see a movie). It was a familiar voice. My father&#8217;s.<br />
Immediately my brain began to have the following conversation:<br />
Left: It&#8217;s dad.<br />
Right: So?<br />
Left: Why would he be calling me?<br />
Right: Hmm&#8230; something important, no doubt. He doesn&#8217;t call otherwise.<br />
Left: He doesn&#8217;t sound upset.<br />
Right: True. Must be something else.<br />
Left: You don&#8217;t suppose&#8230;<br />
Right: Suppose what?<br />
Left: That he&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;in Vancouver?<br />
Left: Oh&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;S**t!<br />
Sure enough, dear ol&#8217; dad had appeared in Vancouver. Why? Because he decided to drive out. Confused? Good, &#8216;cuz I still am&#8230;<br />
You see, when I moved out here, I didn&#8217;t bring my car. I figured I would have it brought out when the time was right. I hadn&#8217;t needed it, so as far as I was concerned, it was a moot point. But my father had wanted to bring it out, dragging my poor mother along for the ride.<br />
So I started talking with my friend Joe, who was living in Toronto, and looking for a new job. I figured he&#8217;d be the perfect person to take my car for a ride. So I started into negotiations, prodding him, bribing him, all sorts of devious under-handed things to get him to drive my car here.<br />
And then my dad shows up with it. At least he didn&#8217;t bring my mother. She was safe at home.<br />
So needless to say, my evening went down the drain rapidly. On the bright side, my father, Allison, and I went out to dinner at the Yaletown Brewery. I figured he could use a couple of beers after the trip out. After that, I drove Allison home, and dad crashed in my bed.<br />
I stayed up to try and find him passage back home. Most of the major airlines wanted at least $1200 for a last-minute one-way ticket. This sort of thing really bothers me. If I call two weeks in advance, it&#8217;s $400. Why should the price rise so much? Lousy capitalism&#8230;<br />
This morning I woke up bright and early at 06:55 &#8230; an hour before I planned to get up. It seemed that dad thought I had to get up at that time. I guess my repeated suggestions that Vancouver time differs quite a bit from Toronto time had gone unnoticed. (I don&#8217;t normally get up until around 08:00.)<br />
My mother called a scant five moments later to tell me that Canada 3000 had deals on their airfare. I had to remind my mom that I wasn&#8217;t in Saskatchewan, and that BC is *three* hours behind, not *two*. (It wasn&#8217;t the first time that she had done that to me.) I made a quick arrangement and booked the flight.<br />
The three of us went out to dinner again, but this time to the Pink Pearl, a Chinese restaurant downtown. It wasn&#8217;t anything to wow about, but at least the food was good. I was a little annoyed at the price, though. I didn&#8217;t think the place would cost so much (it came out to just over $20 a person).<br />
Tomorrow, we dump dear ol&#8217; dad at the airport so he can wing his way back to Toronto. Allison and I are off to Nanaimo on Friday afternoon (I think). I hope everyone has a good weekend, and I&#8217;ll let you know what happened with mine!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entry is long overdue &#8212; I should have issued this sometime last week. But it&#8217;s been one of those weeks where I&#8217;ve barely had time to check my email, let alone write any.<br />
It all started a few weeks ago, when I heard through the grapevine that my mother and my mother&#8217;s mother (to whom all the young&#8217;uns on this side of the family affectionately refer to as &#8220;Nana&#8221;) were going to be visiting my aunt and uncle in Calgary. This was a particularly good thing for me &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen my mother in a couple of months, I hadn&#8217;t seen Nana since early September, I hadn&#8217;t seen Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike (not to mention my hyper little cousin Jennifer) since August, nor had I seen Pam since that time (she also lives in Calgary, but is the daughter of another part of the family), and I hadn&#8217;t seen Stuart or Therese since Christmas.<br />
No, Stuart and Therese aren&#8217;t a part of my biological family. They are however, two of my closest friends in the world &#8212; and are for all intents and purposes, my extended family. Having to shift from seeing them nearly everyday, to seeing them once every few months isn&#8217;t easy. And I&#8217;d been wanting to see them for quite a while, especially since they had bought two new siamese kittens.<br />
So I sat down and looked at the cost of airfare. Allison looked at the cheapest ways out there &#8212; by car, and by bus. She wanted to come (and I wanted her to come), but she didn&#8217;t have the money to pay for the $200 airfare. (We&#8217;d missed the seat sale requirements by one lousy day.)<br />
For a while, it looked like Allison wouldn&#8217;t be able to go. And I really wasn&#8217;t keen on going without her. But then luck shined upon the both of us &#8230; she &#8220;found&#8221; $800 in her bank accounts. As her father put it: &#8220;Only Allison could find $800.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know how she did it, but at that point, I didn&#8217;t care to find out.<br />
To ease our travelling (and get the cheapest airfare possible), we opted to leave early on Friday the 17th. Allison got the day off, and I just didn&#8217;t bother to go in (my office has such flexible time that I can decide not to come in one day, just so long as I make the time up at some point).<br />
We drove down to Richmond (where YVR &#8212; the Vancouver Airport &#8212; sprawls over Sea Island), and hunted for a cheap place to park Allison&#8217;s car. We found a lot at the Comfort Inn that charged only $3 a day. We had considered taking the bus, but we were coming back at 08:20 on the Monday, and Allison needed a quick (and inexpensive) way to work.<br />
We were flying WestJet, a small airline that offers really cheap airfare between cities in the west (they have extended as far as Winnipeg, but whether they&#8217;ll go any further is anyone&#8217;s guess). We checked in, got our tickets (WestJet doesn&#8217;t issue &#8220;real&#8221; tickets, only boarding passes, which have to be picked up the day of the flight), and went to have breakfast. (WestJet doesn&#8217;t offer meals on their flights, and we were starving.)<br />
The flight was quite nice &#8212; we flew in an arc over northern Washington State, recieving a wonderful view of area around Mount Baker, and we could see as far as Mount Ranier.<br />
We arrived in Calgary around 11:20. As we touched down, Allison noted that it was &#8220;rather flat&#8221;. The Calgary-bashing had started. We weaved our way through the terminal to the baggage claim, so I could get my backpack. While we waited, I inquired about taking a bus downtown.<br />
We had to meet my cousin Pam at her office. She had graciously offered us the use of her sofa-bed and even her car (which she barely used) during our stay in Calgary. I checked in with her, and arranged for a time.<br />
We hopped a bus, which took us down to the Whitehorn C-Train station. (The C-Train is Calgary&#8217;s LRT system, and is part-and-parcel of their transit system.) We took the train downtown to the approximate intersection where we found find Pam&#8217;s office building.<br />
My only gripe about Calgary is that the road systems are WAY too confusing. Downtown, everything is numbered &#8212; streets and avenues. If someone gives you the information backwards by accident, you could end up blocks away. To further complicate issues, downtown is also where the city is split up into quadrants &#8212; so the roads restart their numbering four times. Fortunately, we were always in the southern quadrants while looking for Pam.<br />
The Petro-Canada tower wasn&#8217;t hard to find, and surprisingly enough, neither was Pam &#8212; we ran into her after had a bite to eat for lunch. At first I didn&#8217;t recognise her &#8212; she seemed to have lost a little weight from the last time I saw her. (Then again, she had been wearing a thick sweater that time.)<br />
She gave us instructions, the keys to her apartment and her car, and the code to get into her building. We were off again, to find her illusive apartment. Her instructions weren&#8217;t exactly correct, we found ourselves dumped at a parking lot (and yes, we had followed those instructions correctly). A shift of two blocks east corrected that problem).<br />
Our first order of business was to see the family. Pam had warned us that they were out, and wouldn&#8217;t be back until 15:30 that afternoon. So we thought we&#8217;d take our time and look around a little. We decided to go for a drive in Pam&#8217;s car.<br />
In general, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of most Japanese cars &#8212; I don&#8217;t fit in them very well. (The problems with being a large person.) I had complained a few times about Allison&#8217;s Toyota Corolla, because it was small (for me &#8212; Allison kept saying I should make a concerted effort to be smaller). Pam&#8217;s Nissan Micra made me feel claustrophobic.<br />
The sun in the Prairies is bright. I had forgotten how bright &#8212; Vancouver&#8217;s sun is muted by the cloud cover. The both of us ended up buying sunglasses to counter the painful squinting.<br />
We arrived at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house a little after 15:30 (after arriving early, finding no-one home, and then going off to purchase the aforementioned sunglasses). My aunt Brenda answered the door, motioned us to be quiet, and pointed at the kitchen. I boldly walked into the kitchen, plunked my bags down, and loudly announced &#8220;Hello&#8221;.<br />
Oh &#8230; did I mention that neither my mother or Nana knew that I was coming?<br />
My mother looked up at me, and there was an instant look of recognition in her face &#8230; quickly followed by the look that appears as the visual thought of something that is out of place. Surprise followed soon after. Nana, on the other hand, seemed completely overwhelmed by the seemingly unending surprises.<br />
Allison and I sat down and talked with my relatives for a while, during which various family members came and went. Eventually, it was our turn to leave. Our family night was planned for the following night, and I really wanted to see Stuart and Therese.<br />
We spent a little time at Therese and Stuart&#8217;s (trying mostly to get their two new kittens to come out from under the bed long enough so I could see them) before we decided to go out to dinner.<br />
Stuart suggested that we try Montana&#8217;s, a chain of steakhouses that had finally migrated to Calgary. Therese referred to it as &#8220;Stuart and Geoff food&#8221;, which I have to admit, I took some offense to. My diet has changed quite significantly since I arrived in Vancouver, and I tend not to eat all the things I used to.<br />
At any rate, the place was packed, and we ended up at Joey Tomatoes not too far away. It was a pretty decent meal all around. And it gave us a good time to sit and talk and visit.<br />
Afterwards, we went back to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s, where we continued to talk a while longer. Well, most of us talked a while longer. Therese kept dropping off. She works a lot at school, and it takes a lot out of her. One day, she&#8217;ll be able to stay up after midnight&#8230;<br />
When Allison and I arrived home that night, we were ultra-careful not to wake up Pam. The sofa-bed was already set up, and it didn&#8217;t take us long to go to sleep.<br />
The next day, Allison and I decided that we would visit Banff. Although we had both been there before (not at the same time), we wanted to visit again. In both cases, we had only a short time to look around, and Banff is one of those places you really need to see carefully.<br />
The trip out was uneventful &#8230; except we were wondering whether Pam&#8217;s Micra would make it intact. It was a peppy little car &#8230; going downhill. The hour-and-a-half drive was a little more than the car could take.<br />
But it was worth the drive. Banff was in full bloom (snow included), and was quite the sight to see. The tourists were mostly gone (I guess it wasn&#8217;t their time of the year anymore) &#8230; except for the throngs of people waiting outside of the Roots. We guessed that someone like Elvis Stojko or Ross Rebigilati was inside.<br />
We visited the Hot Springs (the wrong ones, so it turned out &#8212; the original hot springs were in a different location), the Banff Springs Hotel (I have to stay there at least one night in my life), and drove around in the town. Finally, we headed back to Calgary for dinner with the family.<br />
The next day, on a suggestion from my family, we visited Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, an historical site in the southern portion of Alberta. In use for nearly 5,700 years, the buffalo jump was a cliff that natives used to kill large groups of buffalo.<br />
The museum is built into the side of the cliff, not too far from the location of the actual buffalo jump. Great care was taken in building the site, such that it wouldn&#8217;t affect the any of the archeological remains in the area. The design, combined with the unbelievable quality of the education, garnered the museum the honour of being a UNESCO site. It was worth the five hour round-trip.<br />
We asked Stuart to come along with us, mostly because it would get him out of the apartment he shared with Therese. (Therese had to mark 40 20-page essays, and having Stuart around wasn&#8217;t exactly helpful.) Furthermore, I wanted to see as much of my friends as possible.<br />
The next morning, we had to catch our flight back to Vancouver. By that point, we had pretty much come to the conclusion that we could not live in Calgary. Allison had written off Calgary within a few moments of arriving (her first comment was: &#8220;It&#8217;s flat!&#8221;), but it didn&#8217;t take too long for me to realise that Calgary was no longer for me either.<br />
Having arrived in Calgary from Ontario, I found it very nice. But after living in Vancouver for nearly four months, I found Calgary&#8217;s appeal much lessened. I suspect that I shall have a hard time finding another place I love as much.<br />
And if you&#8217;re wondering just how I came to this conclusion, when I arrived back in Vancouver, not only did I feel more relaxed, but I felt like I was home. Not just back where I lived, but where I felt I should live.<br />
We then had the nasty task of attempting to find Allison&#8217;s car. We couldn&#8217;t remember the name of the company we had left it with. I knew it was a set of initials, but I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. We eventually remembered that the lot was at the Comfort Inn. It seemed that DPS, the people we left the car with, were known as Diamond Parking Services &#8230; everywhere except on their signs.<br />
On Sunday (the 28th), we delivered Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, to the Hand of Fate &#8212; and the airport. Jane was moving to Europe. She had made the decision that she would live in Britain for a while &#8230; about a year.<br />
And she was not too excited about it either. Well, she was and she wasn&#8217;t. Most importantly, she was terrified. This was the first time she had been away from home. Mrs. Collins was almost as worried as Jane.<br />
I was envious. She was going somewhere I hadn&#8217;t been. I want to go to Europe. I&#8217;ve never been, and there&#8217;s so much to see. Perhaps one day I will go. Allison even hinted that we could visit with Jane.<br />
I wish her well, and hope that she has the time of her life. She will likely be a very different person when I meet her next. I only hope that life doesn&#8217;t jade her.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting few days. This weekend, as you already know, was Easter. This was the first time I was not in Ontario for Easter. I had been away from home before &#8212; usually on co-op terms (although university often did its fair share), but this was the first time that I was threatened with complete isolation from all friends and family.<br />
But I was saved by the graciousness of the Collins. They invited me to spend the Easter holidays with them. I, of course, accepted. I wasn&#8217;t interested in sitting in my lonely apartment all weekend.<br />
Allison and I left on Friday moring, catching the 12:30 ferry to Nanaimo. We went downtown to catch the 257 Horseshoe Bay Express. We didn&#8217;t want to take the car over &#8212; BC Ferries is in my opinion (and probably others) prohibitively expensive.<br />
We took the bus from the start of its route. This was Allison&#8217;s idea &#8212; and a very good one. When we got to the stop at the Bay on West Georgia, there were approximately a hundred people waiting. Our bus was full in a matter of moments.<br />
While we waited for people to board, someone knocked on the window. It was Jane, Allison&#8217;s sister. She was returning from the Arts Council Festival (or something like that), featuring Holly MacNarland and Great Big Sea. She was heading home for work. However, she would not be able get on our bus. BC Transit, however, is not for a lack of intelligence. They had another bus following ours, which picked up the remainder of the waiting passengers.<br />
The ferry traffic was heavy. Lots of cars, and lots of people. We made the sailing (so did Jane and her friend, Renata), which was 15 minutes late in leaving. During the crossing, we called Allison&#8217;s parents to inform them that there would be four of us, not just two. (This was important because we were to be picked up &#8230; and no matter how hard you try, you can&#8217;t pack six people into a Honda Civic.)<br />
That night was a quiet dinner with Allison, her parents, and her brother, Randy, when he arrived home from work. It was a roast of beef that came without yorkshire pudding or cheese sauce (for the broccoli), a result of Allison&#8217;s aunt Vicky appearing and staying too long. (Allison&#8217;s mom, who is Vicky&#8217;s sister, could not break away to continue with dinner.)<br />
Afterwards, we played Scrabble. It was a rather interesting game, mostly because the two English majors (Allison and myself) could not defeat Allison&#8217;s father. I could not remember the last time I had played, if ever.<br />
The next day, Allison took me around Nanaimo, showing me some of the different little townships that made up the whole city (and let me tell you &#8212; Nanaimo is a huge city). We went down to the waterfront (which apparently wasn&#8217;t a waterfront until a few decades ago &#8212; most of it was filled in), where the last bastion of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company remains presevered.<br />
We walked along the concrete and steel railed wharf, passing by such interesting things as the Javawocky, a little cafe. Most of the boats in the harbour (that we could see) were fishing trawlers. I didn&#8217;t know if there were in harbour because of the holiday, or were idled due to the drop in the fishing industry. Most looked in good condition, so I can only assume it was the holiday.<br />
We continued down to an artificial lagoon. which the city had built to enhance the waterfront. It created a small, sheltered beach, and calm water that remained even when the tide was low. Stray logs from the log booms that are towed through Georgia Strait had washed to the beach &#8230; or had been dragged there for character. On the other side of the lagoon was a large children&#8217;s playground, perhaps the most exciting looking one I&#8217;d ever seen. I wished I was 10 again.<br />
Not far away was a bronze statue of an ex-mayor who was &#8220;affectionately&#8221; known as &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. He was the man who invented the idea of the Bathtub Races (you only way you could *not* have heard about the Nanaimo Bathtub Race is if you&#8217;ve been living in a dark room for the past few decades). He dressed as a pirate (especially during said races), which is where he obtained the name &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. However. as a mayor, he did some pretty questionable (and in a few cases, down-right unethical) things, so the name had more than one connotation.<br />
That night, we had a full turkey dinner (again, with a delayed Randy) with Grandma Collins, a wonderful woman who was an utter delight to have conversation with. She certainly didn&#8217;t strike me as the &#8220;typical&#8221; little old lady. She was more concerned with having fun.<br />
After dinner, Allison and I went out with Kelly, an old friend of Allison&#8217;s whom she hadn&#8217;t seen in over four years, and went to a pub downtown (nearly everything else closes down early in Nanaimo &#8230; even coffee shops) for a few drinks. None of us had anything alcoholic, but we were there for a couple of hours.<br />
The next morning was the day of the Easter Egg hunts. I can&#8217;t honestly remember the last time that the Easter Bunny visited my sister and I, but I can guess at it being many, many years. Well, it seems that the Easter Bunny is alive and well in Nanaimo &#8230; and he made many a visit this morning.<br />
First off was in the Collins household. It seems that there is a tradition, where the two resident rabbits (Mr. and Mrs. Collins) hide things in the kitchen. I was an unwitting inductee. Amongst various chocolates, I also received a t-shirt. I was extremely surprised (not expecting anything of the sort), and most thankful.<br />
Then it was off to Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents (less than a five minute drive) for lunch. That was, lunch after the Easter Egg hunt. (Yes, another one.) This time, the hunt was more elaborate. Everyone (except Mr. and Mrs. Vaillette &#8212; I apologise if the spelling is incorrect) had a plastic egg hidden somewhere around the tree. Inside the egg was a rhyme, which was our clue to the location of our prize (hidden by Brenna, one of Allison&#8217;s cousins).<br />
Needless to say, I think I was terribly well treated for an outsider. But you won&#8217;t hear me complaining!<br />
Well, there&#8217;s not much more at this point &#8230; more will come later on as I continue. But life resumes tomorrow &#8212; back to work, back to playing games.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First and foremost, I apologise for not writing sooner. It&#8217;s been over a month since my last message, and I can safely say that in those four weeks, I&#8217;ve been so busy that I can group my life into three categories: Work, spending time with Allison, and sleeping. Those of you who know me can probably guess where the majority of my time was spent. (For those of you who don&#8217;t, the list is in order of time spent.)<br />
This means that I&#8217;ve had little time for the basic things, like shopping for food and laundry. Needless to say, email fell quite sharply in priority. But with things winding down (at least a little), I&#8217;m finding the time to write.<br />
What has kept me so busy? Well, if you&#8217;ll remember from one of my last messages, I was hired by Radical Entertainment (<a href="http://www.radical.ca/">www.radical.ca</a> &#8212; yes, the website&#8217;s pretty blaise, but apparently we&#8217;re working on it) as a technical writer. For those of you who missed it the first time, Radical makes video games.<br />
You&#8217;d think that working for a video game company means I play video games all day. Well, you&#8217;d be pretty much correct &#8230; at least when there&#8217;s a good Quake 2 deathmatch, or someone starts a game of Worms 2. And then there&#8217;s the previews of our own games, not to mention the zillions of demos we go through in a week &#8230; bla bla bla. Sounds pretty dull, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
The week after I started, Tim (I seem to be cursed with bosses named &#8216;Tim&#8217;) gave me first big assignment: get the documentation ready for the next software release &#8230; two weeks later.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t sound too bad, does it? Well, allow me to provide some details. The team I work in is called &#8220;Pure3D&#8221;, and they&#8217;re the rendering gurus of the company. They write all the functions and libraries that all the game teams use to make video games. This means that I had to learn everything there was to know about computer graphics in a very short span of time. I also had to learn what all the software did, how to use it, and how to use the existing documentation format.<br />
Needless to say, the documentation didn&#8217;t meet with my satisfaction. The fact was, I simply didn&#8217;t have the time to do the job I wanted to do. Another month and a half, and I might have been able to straighten the whole thing out.<br />
Almost immediately following, I got drafted to do the Scientific Research and Experimental Development report so we could get a chunk of money back from the Feds. I had done one last year for Arkipelago, so I was familiar with the report. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for the sheer amount of work that Radical does in a year. The document stands at over 100 pages, and I&#8217;m still not done editing it.<br />
That has been the majority of my time for the past little while. It&#8217;s rather draining, but it&#8217;s also a lot of fun. And I know I&#8217;m getting satisfaction from the job. So all in all, I have nothing to complain about.<br />
All this means that I haven&#8217;t been getting out of Vancouver much. I didn&#8217;t even really do anything fun until last weekend, when Allison and I decided we&#8217;d look into (everyone brace yourselves for this) condos.<br />
Yes, condos. Glorified apartments. Condos are the most cost-effective real estate in the lower mainland &#8230; unless you&#8217;re rich and can afford the housing out here. Mind you, even after Allison and I looked around, we weren&#8217;t too impressed with the condos out here.<br />
In fact, we were so unimpressed, that we came to the conclusion that there was only one place we could live &#8212; Calgary. Vancouver&#8217;s too expensive, and Allison doesn&#8217;t like the suburbs. (Frankly, I agree with her.) So when it comes time for us to settle down, we have to leave.<br />
We did some calculations, and we found that no matter how we looked at it, living in Vancouver (condo or not) just wasn&#8217;t worth the money. We make sure of our ideas by popping onto a real estate database (www.mls.com) to see what we could find in Calgary. (If anyone&#8217;s interested, there&#8217;s some really nice properties in Banff for less than $200k.)<br />
Since then, we&#8217;ve also started considering Victoria. The only reason we&#8217;re a little apprehensive about Victoria is that it&#8217;s &#8230; well, quiet. Very quiet. Disturbingly quiet. It&#8217;s for the Just Wed and Nearly Dead, so I hear. Certainly feels that way too.<br />
We started looking ahead to vacations. We think we&#8217;re going to take two one-week vacations and explore the coasts of the US &#8212; east in late August, and west in late fall. But then again, we may go to Hawaii&#8230; We&#8217;re still thinking. There&#8217;s also Prince Albert National Park, where I can see my relatives, but that&#8217;s just a thought at this point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Greetings from Lotus Land! (I still have no idea why people call it that &#8212; nowadays you could reefer to it as Grass Land &#8230; yes, I spelled &#8220;reefer&#8221; on purpose.)<br />
Undoubtedly you&#8217;ve all heard the trials and tribulations of Ross Rebagliati (sp?), the Canadian Snowboarding gold medalist. The whole thing wasn&#8217;t really played up too much around here, other than we thought that it was a really dumb thing to get worked up about. It all came down to punctuation for us:<br />
Rest of the World: They smoke marijuana in Whistler?<br />
British Columbia: They smoke marijuana in Whistler.<br />
(It&#8217;s not a question, it&#8217;s a fact. You could also have written our response a little more succinctly: &#8220;DUH!&#8221;)<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that jokes weren&#8217;t flying about &#8212; one had Ross as the new spokesperson for Hostess. (Y&#8217;know &#8212; &#8220;when you got the munchies&#8230;&#8221;)<br />
Life wound up at Prologic Corp. right on schedule, and I left on Friday without a hitch. And then it was off for the weekend.<br />
Allison and I made plans to spend Valentine&#8217;s day in Victoria. But first, we had to get to the island. At roughly 17:15, we departed the office, jumped in Allison&#8217;s car, and headed to Horseshoe Bay, which is roughly north-west of Vancouver. Although the ferry port at Tswassen (which is pronounced &#8220;swaa-sen&#8221; or &#8220;te-waa-sen&#8221;, depending on who you ask) was closer, there was a two sailing wait (there were *that* many cars waiting to leave &#8212; each ferry takes between 150 and 200 cars, and the sailings are at most once an hour), and we wanted to be in Nanaimo before 22:00, if possible.<br />
We arrived at Horseshoe Bay about 18:15 or so (yes, it took that long to get there). We purchased a ticket for the next sailing, which was 19:00. Unlike Tswassen, we wouldn&#8217;t have to wait.<br />
This was a good thing. The ferry takes a minimum of an hour and a half to get to the other side. We arrived in Nanaimo around 20:45 (counting the delays, and the loading/unloading time), and we promptly headed for Fast Eddies, a local favourite restaurant (best blackened chicken I&#8217;ve had outside of New Orleans!). We wanted to have dinner before descending on Allison&#8217;s parents.<br />
When arrived at the Collins family estate, Allison expressed her concern that she might not be able to sneak me inside &#8212; all the doors were locked. Why did she want to sneak me inside &#8212; several of her relatives were there. I was worried enough about meeting her parents, let alone a portion of her family tree (albeit a small portion &#8212; apparently Allison&#8217;s family tree is quite extensive).<br />
The introductions went quite well (I wasn&#8217;t immediately thrown out of the house, nor was I asked a great deal of embarrasing questions). Of course, I figured a way out of receiving the Evil Eyes &#8212; I brought a box of chocolates for Allison&#8217;s parents. When in doubt, go for the brownie points!<br />
(I&#8217;ve since found out that I&#8217;ve passed the &#8220;first test&#8221;. I&#8217;m somewhat apprehensive about the &#8220;second test&#8221;.)<br />
The conversation was not centred around me (thankfully), but it allowed me to get my foot in once in a while (I know families where you have to shout to be heard). But the family slowly weeded itself down until it was just Mr. and Mrs. Collins, Allison, and myself. Her sister Jane, who bears a striking resemblance to Kirsten Dunst (who appeared in such movies as Interview with the Vampire and Wag the Dog) showed up later, and promptly started downing a litre of cold pre-made cappaccino. Allison&#8217;s brother Randy appeared about a half hour afterwards.<br />
The next day we drove down the Island Highway (aka Canada Route 1, aka the Trans Canada Highway) to Victoria. Some parts of that trip were like travelling through a fairy tale &#8212; huge trees coated with deep green moss, huge cliffs dripping with lush vegetation &#8212; a rainforest without monkeys or macaus.<br />
Victoria was decidedly nicer than Nanaimo &#8212; namely, it wasn&#8217;t raining. We checked into the James Bay Inn (Victoria has a big thing about James Bay, for some strange reason), which was a block from the house Emily Carr was born in. We then decided to walk around Victoria.<br />
Victoria is a beautiful city &#8212; it reminds me very much of more European cities &#8212; Helsinki, most notably. I think it&#8217;s one of the smallest capitals in Canada &#8212; certainly the smallest west of Quebec (and south of the northern Territories). It&#8217;s also very relaxed. VERY relaxed. No-one seems in a rush (of course, all the horse-drawn carriages might attribute to that).<br />
We visited the Royal BC Museum (not as extensive as the ROM, but I think the collection of Native artifacts cannot be paralleled &#8212; except maybe by the Museum of Anthropology at UBC), which took us a couple of hours. Then we wandered over to a place called &#8220;Undersea World&#8221; (or some similarly cheesy name). It&#8217;s a building set into the harbour, with a few walls around the outside in the water. It&#8217;s an aquarium essentially, but the water&#8217;s right out of the bay (there are grates that open right into the surrounding water). The admission included a 15 minute scuba show where a diver showed off some of the various fauna of the deep.<br />
The most surprising thing I saw in that show was the conditioning of the fish &#8212; not the water conditioning, I mean the mental conditioning! I had always assumed (rather naively, so it seems) that the brain stems of fish were capable of only providing survival instincts &#8212; that fish couldn&#8217;t really &#8220;learn&#8221; things. The diver proved me very wrong. He pulled out a triangle (the kind you see in old westerns when Cookie calls the cowboys for dinner) and rang it. All the fish suddenly turned and gravitated towards him. Mondo creepy. Pavlov would be proud.<br />
We proceeded along the roads to see what there was to see, which included Chinatown, and Fan Tan Alley &#8212; the narrowest road in Canada. It&#8217;s about a metre wide. There are actual addresses (stores, specifically), so it&#8217;s a designated (complete with postal code) road. Parts of &#8220;Bird on a Wire&#8221; (filmed in 1990, starring Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn) were filmed in Vancouver and Victoria, including Fan Tan Alley.<br />
We had a very filling meal at a local Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (Note: Victoria&#8217;s Chinatown is less than a block, and is mostly for tourists). The service was lousy, but the food was great! The meal ended with the traditional fortune cookies. I had to laugh when I read my fortune: &#8220;Luck is coming your way.&#8221; (This is funny when you remember to read it the way you&#8217;re supposed to read fortunes.)<br />
The next morning (this morning), we toured around the city, where I made an effort to take a picture of the beginning of the Trans Canada Highway (yes kiddies, the TCH *starts* in Victoria &#8212; how&#8217;s that for trivia? Fool your friends!) We then wound our way to Craigdarroch Castle, built by millionaire coal baron (and all-round nasty guy) Robert Dunsmuir. Rumour has it that he blew up a mine full of workers (seven died) because of complains about the quality of life, the lack of wages, and so forth. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be too much sentiment for the guy.<br />
Finally, we headed back to Vancouver, via the Schwartz Bay ferry terminal. We barely missed making the ferry, and had to wait an hour until the next sailing. I will say one thing for the ferries in BC &#8212; they&#8217;re usually pretty nice, and the trip from Schwartz Bay to Tswassen is a beautiful one! I highly recommend it to anyone making the trip! (Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay is mostly in open water, but gives you a great view of the mountains on a clear day).<br />
Anyhoo, this log is plently long enough for now. I now leave you to your regular activities&#8230;<br />
By the way, for those of you who don&#8217;t know the &#8220;real&#8221; way you&#8217;re supposed to read a fortune, you add &#8220;in bed&#8221; at the end. Believe it or not, most fortunes make more sense that way&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is the big day &#8212; I finally get my apartment, and I can make a trip to IKEA so I can put something in my apartment other than myself!<br />
At any rate&#8230;<br />
The weather out here has been really good lately. It&#8217;s been warming up (apparently spring starts in a couple of weeks!), I actually had my sandals on yesterday! (There&#8217;s something I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do in Ontario for at least a couple of months!)<br />
Ran across the border yesterday (we&#8217;re less than a half hour away, or so it seems). It seems very weird to go across the border without having to cross a bridge.<br />
Lots of good restaurants out here. Not having an apartment makes eating a little difficult, so we&#8217;ve been trying all sorts of interesting places. There&#8217;s a place in Kitsilano (down on the south side of English Bay) called &#8220;Naam&#8221;, which is an all vegetarian restaurant. I have to admit, whole almonds in a meal aren&#8217;t that bad&#8230;<br />
Then there&#8217;s &#8220;All India Foods and Sweets&#8221;, a small (but very busy) Indian restaurant. They&#8217;ve got a vegetarian buffet that&#8217;s a killer! Really spicy food all for $6! Can&#8217;t go wrong there!<br />
Sushi is cheap here. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to get any yet, but you can buy large trays (18 pcs) for $3-$6. And I don&#8217;t need to tell you how fresh it is. You can&#8217;t go through some parts of the city without seeing a sushi bar every minute or so.<br />
Then there&#8217;s some of the chain restaurants: Milestone&#8217;s (a kind of upscale bar/eatery that serves huge portions for next to nothing, and the food is always great), Earl&#8217;s (those of you in the west have heard of them, but for those of you in the east, I feel sorry that you can&#8217;t try them out!), and OSF (the Old Spaghetti Factory &#8212; yeah, I know there&#8217;s one in Toronto, but I still like the place).<br />
Anyway, enough on food&#8230; now I&#8217;m all hungry and I haven&#8217;t had breakfast yet!<br />
Well, I think I&#8217;m going to have to cut this short, because I have to start moving. (Not that it will take me a long time, but it&#8217;s still gotta be done.)<br />
More updates as events occur!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We arrived late last night, no thanks to our most punctual airline. We made the mistake of taking a charter flight. What made it worse that the charter airline sub-contracted another charter airline to fly us to Vancouver. Air Transat isn&#8217;t exactly known for comfort. Royal Airlines ain&#8217;t exactly known &#8230; period.<br />
This was my first little apprehension. The plane was a Boeing 727-200. The chairs were so tightly packed that my knees were touching the seat in front of me. There was next to no room in the overhead compartments. It took nearly 45 minutes to get everyone on the plane. It was so tightly packed that a woman a couple of rows behind us had a panic attack and forced her way off the plane. I couldn&#8217;t blame her. As a direct result of her bailing out of the plane, the flight was delayed a further hour as they attempted to find her bag buried in the cargo hold. After over an hour and a half of waiting, we finally took to the air.<br />
Mental note to self: never fly anything except Canadian and Air Canada in the future. Canada 3000 as a last resort.<br />
On the plus side, we got free &#8220;sparkling wine&#8221; (a fancy way of saying that the wine they used wasn&#8217;t fit for peeling paint off walls), a reasonably decent meal (reconstituted chicked with unidentifiable green goop in the middle), and a pre-mixed salad that was not entirely unlike bad coleslaw. Real wine (someone&#8217;s joke of fermented grape juice) was available at that point. Liqueurs (brandy, schnapps, and some other harsh chemical) were served not longer after dinner. The guy sitting in the window seat kept talking to Allison, despite her heroic attempts to talk with me every chance she got &#8230; and took every chance to feel her up.<br />
The plane came to a rather rough bounce (kinda like when you skip stones across a pond) when we arrived. After walking most of the way across the Lower Mainland, we found our baggage carousel, and waited another 45 minutes for our lost luggage to be found. (For a while, we were wondering if the schmucks who took the luggage off in Toronto had forgotten to put it back on.)<br />
We didn&#8217;t get to Allison&#8217;s apartment until nearly 1:30am (Vancouver Time), where we promptly went to bed.<br />
This morning was rough. Ugly rough. The alarm went off at 7:30. We couldn&#8217;t pry ourselves out of bed until just after 8:00. I had a long list of things that I needed to do, and one of those things was an interview with Prologic Corporation (Allison&#8217;s company). It was time to play dress-up.<br />
We left the apartment just after 8:30. Allison dropped me off at a bus stop, so I could take a bus downtown. The ambient temperature was about 5-7 degrees, but the ambient humidity of about six trillion percent made it feel like two below zero.<br />
For the record: Vancouverites aren&#8217;t wimps. They may not be able to handle an Ontario winter, but I don&#8217;t think many Ontarioites can handle the kind of penetrating weather they have here.<br />
Upon arriving downtown, I made a valiant effort to contact the human resources manager at Prologic, to arrange the time for the interview (the time hadn&#8217;t been established by that point). The time was set for 2pm, so I had time to kill.<br />
I wandered down Davie St. trying to find the Vancouver Public Library. I needed to find a phone book (every single phone booth in Vancouver has had the phone book removed), so I could call the companies I had sent resumes to. Along the way, I found a McDonalds, and immediately called for breakfast.<br />
I began to notice the cold. I was wearing a dress-shirt, my sports jacket, and my slacks. I was cold. I decided that an overcoat wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad idea after all. Upon finding the Eaton&#8217;s store while trying to find the Library, I decided that a coat of some kind would be a good idea.<br />
That little task was repeated through most of the day. I don&#8217;t know what it is with people, particularly men&#8217;s fashions, but the cheapest raincoat I could find was $220. Hello?? Who buys a RAINCOAT for $220?? The most expensive one I found was over $1,000!! Who makes this stuff up?!<br />
Giving up on the raincoat issue for now (I had an umbrella for protection, and I wasn&#8217;t freezing to death), I found my way to the library. I checked up a couple of numbers, and decided that I should give myself a new challenge &#8212; find my way to Richmond, which is where Prologic has its offices.<br />
After polling a few bus drivers, I found the appropriate bus, and headed towards my interview. Allison had told me to get off the bus at Garden City and Cambie, where she would pick me up and bring me to Prologic. (The bus that ran from that corner to Prologic wasn&#8217;t exactly frequent.) I arrived at the corner about 45 minutes early, so I opted for lunch before calling Allison. Spying a 7-11 just down the road, I headed down to see what I could find.<br />
I walked into a small Italian pizzeria (which I would find out later was much more expensive than others in the area &#8212; I&#8217;m new to all this), and had a quick bite. Allison met me at the corner of Cambie and Garden City about a quarter to 2:00. She gave me a couple of quick pointers, and then sent me in to meet with destiny.<br />
While I waited for my first interviewer to appear, I quickly acquainted myself with some of Prologic&#8217;s literature on the desk &#8230; and the washroom. (Walking around in the penetrating chill had caused my bladder to swell somewhat.)<br />
When my first interview arrived, she took me to her office and started with the typical list of interview questions &#8230; except for the first: Why did you move to Vancouver?<br />
Then it was off to another building in the complex (Prologic has about 160 employees, and is growing at an unbelievable rate), usually referred to as &#8220;Second City&#8221;. (The third building is known as &#8220;Third Rock&#8221;.)<br />
There I was interviewed by the training manager, who wanted to know what kind of editing experience I had. Prologic needs an editor to work on some standards documents, and Allison thought I had the necessary anal retentiveness to make it work. (No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
I met with Allison after the interview, where she suggested I go to Oak Ridge Centre and wander around for a couple of hours before going back to her place. I would meet her at the entrance to Safeway so she could do some shopping. By the time she arrived, my feet were ready to abdicate from the rest of my body, and my shoulders had dropped two inches from carrying my laptop around all day.<br />
When we arrived back at her apartment, I made a hasty change, so we could go out to dinner. While we were getting ready the phone rang. It was Prologic calling to tell me they were willing to take me on. (It&#8217;s only a one-month contract, but considering I haven&#8217;t been here for 24 hours yet, I think it&#8217;s a good sign.) Following the call, we headed out for dinner.<br />
The restaurant of choice was &#8220;Naam&#8221;, a vegetarian (but thankfully, not vegan) restaurant in Kitsilano. Really good food, but it&#8217;s a little disconcerting to read a menu that has no meat on it whatsoever.<br />
And so my first day concludes on a decidedly upward note. There may be more long entries to following, depending on whether or not I want to write them.</p>
