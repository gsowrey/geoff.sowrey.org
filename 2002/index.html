	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Assuming you&#8217;re not avoiding the media or living under a rather large rock, you&#8217;ve probably heard that the second chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy opened today.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I&#8217;ve already seen it.<br />
A few weeks ago (over a month, actually), the Famous Players Paramount Chinook theatre started selling tickets for opening night. First showing: 12:01am.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: That&#8217;s when we saw it.<br />
There were originally just three of us: Adrian, Tamara, and myself. But Jensenne caught wind, and wanted to tag along. The more, the merrier, I say! Besides, then I have more &#8220;normal&#8221; people to stand around so I don&#8217;t look like such a dork being surrounded by obsessed Tolkien fans. (Okay, yes, I was there at midnight for a movie &#8230; but it&#8217;s a good movie!)  And believe me, there were a number of them. They started lining up early. At noon.<br />
Yup, a full twelve hours before the movie started. Why? Good question &#8212; I&#8217;m sure their lives can&#8217;t be so empty of fulfillment that 12 hours is nothing to them. Mind you, Star Wars fans tend more to the obsessive side. Both Tolkien and Star Wars fans are geeky &#8212; can&#8217;t avoid that one. They get really wrapped up in the story, the characters, the ethos of the whole thing. But there are differences between the two. Tolkien fans dress up as characters. Star Wars fans are the characters.<br />
Then there&#8217;s Trekkies. Let&#8217;s not go there.<br />
John was the first person in our group to arrive on the scene, and mostly by accident. He was in the theatre for another reason, and happened to notice &#8212; at 6:00pm &#8212; that the line was already underway. Due to the fortunes of modern technology, the line would form quickly. Our team would fall into place in line, myself being the last to arrive around 9:00pm. (There&#8217;s another whole story to that, but I&#8217;ll spare you the tangent.)<br />
There were noticeable people in the line. A couple were dressed up in costume. One carried a sign on a staff that read: &#8220;One sign to rule them all.&#8221; (Hey, I said Tolkien fans were reserved &#8212; I didn&#8217;t say they were any less geeky than the others.) The group sitting behind us brought &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; Risk &#8212; until that time unopened. The drawback was that none of them had played before. By the time they&#8217;d gotten underway, we had to move the line again. The single best way to kill time in line was the guy who&#8217;d brought a laptop with a DVD player. I&#8217;ll give you three guesses what movie he played.<br />
And no, it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#8221;.<br />
The line formed quickly. Within an hour of my arrival, we&#8217;d already had to shuffle the line twice to prevent blocking other doors. By 10:00, there were so many people in line, we couldn&#8217;t sit down anymore. Sardines have more room. People had to get creative with ways to keep from going mildly mental standing in the line. Tamara got smart and brought playing cards a Nintendo Gameboy. Which, in retrospect, was her downfall&#8230;<br />
A-Channel (a local independent television station) sent out a camera crew to get footage of the freaks in line. Tamara laughed about this, mocking the few at the front who would likely stand out the most. So imagine her surprise, and our amusement, when an A-Channel camera peered over her shoulder as she played Tetris, then thrust a microphone in her face to ask her a question about how she had prepared to stand in line. There&#8217;s nothing like actually seeing the look of &#8220;Please God, not me&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Twenty minutes, and we were in the theatre. After standing for well over an hour, it was good to sit down again. Snacks, a quick run through the washroom, and it was magic time&#8230;<br />
A little over three hours later, we filtered out of the screening (some of us making fast dashes for the washrooms) and headed off into the quiet Wednesday morning. We made a fairly hasty return home. I had to be at work this morning, as per usual. Three hours&#8217; sleep really doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. Good thing work is slow right now.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I fell asleep at work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that I could no longer stall. I had put it off for years, and it wasn&#8217;t really helping me. In fact, my apathy about the entire situation was appalling. To move ahead in such a fashion was foolish, to say the least, and would almost certainly hamper my future.<br />
It was time to buy another computer.<br />
For the last six-odd years, I&#8217;ve been working on an inferior Gateway P133 laptop. It&#8217;s old, heavy, the screen is slowly going, and the CD-ROM drive has been nothing but a nuisance for a very long time. And well, it&#8217;s old, slow, and not really suitable for the things I want to do with a computer. (That includes Internet access, running web servers, using more recent operating systems, and yes, playing video games.)<br />
I looked at Apple, long and hard. I&#8217;ve spent most of my computing life (about 99% of it) on PCs of one form or another. The PC arms race is beyond irritating, and the idea of constantly supporting them really didn&#8217;t sit well with me. Macs are much simpler, I can still do most of my job on them, and that new iMac was worth drooling over (especially the one with the wide screen).<br />
But after much information gathering, not to mention a fair bit of soul searching, I had to come to the conclusion that I would have to purchase a PC. Not my most favourite of conclusions. But at least it was a direction. Now for a vendor.<br />
My initial thought was Dell. I&#8217;d had a bad experience with Gateway 2000 some time ago, so I wasn&#8217;t really too keen on mail-order computers (or Internet-order, for that matter). But Dell has an impressive track record, and I have yet to hear a really disparaging comment about their systems. Besides, the laptop I used when I was with the CBC (software notwithstanding) was so impressive, that their desktop computers can&#8217;t all be bad.<br />
I searched, I priced, and I bought: Pentium 4 2.4GHz system with 512 MB RAM, an 80 GB hard drive, a 48x CD-ROM drive, a 4x DVD-R/CD-RW drive, IEEE 1394 ports, Turtle Beach sound card, an nVidia GeForce4 MX video card, a 17&#8243; LCD flat panel display, and some really nice speakers. No, it wasn&#8217;t cheap (the monitor really jacked up the price), but it was worth it.<br />
Almost.<br />
I had no Internet. When you live and breathe hypertext transfer protocol, you really do need a constant connection. And I ain&#8217;t talkin&#8217; about the measly 56k modem installed in the computer. I mean ASDL or Cable access. 24/7. All the information I could ever want, whenever I wanted it. Problem: Tamara already had it.<br />
Well, okay, that&#8217;s not really a problem. But it meant that we needed another port. Shaw charges $10 a month for an extra port. That seems just a little silly to me, since it&#8217;s no skin off their backs. Especially when for $130, I can purchase a little router that will allow up to four computers from our house to surf the &#8216;net or communicate with each other. But first, to find a router.<br />
That took a little longer, but surprisingly enough, not too long. My first stop was at Memory Express &#8212; *the* place to find computer parts in Calgary. Sold out. For a week. Who&#8217;da thunk there&#8217;d be a run on routers at this time of the year? But the Memory Express staff is extremely helpful &#8212; they suggested I try Compusmart down the road.<br />
Compusmart is one of those stores I try to avoid: flashy, high-flallutin&#8217; (at least so far as computer stores go), and the salespeople tend to be a little pushy. But they had the router I wanted. Then I tried a little tactic &#8212; did they do price matching? Luckily for me, they did. I pointed the salesman to Memory Express&#8217; website. Same router, and now the same price.<br />
Back at home, I pulled the router out of its box and did something I don&#8217;t normally do: read the instructions. This was because I was about to seriously screw around with Tamara&#8217;s computer, and she wasn&#8217;t there for me to ask for permission. Whatever I was about to do, I wanted to make sure that I could restore my changes and not affect her one bit.<br />
I read the sheet carefully (it fold out to the approximate size of a city map), then went into Tamara&#8217;s room and plugged the router into the electrical socket, plugged the Internet feed from the modem into the router, Tamara&#8217;s computer into the router, and my computer into the router.<br />
It took more time for me to read the instructions than it did for me to start surfing the web. A few years ago, this would have been like pulling teeth. I honestly can&#8217;t believe it was this easy! Suddenly, Macs aren&#8217;t quite so appealing.<br />
So I&#8217;m finally going to be mildly productive at home. Basically, I can do my own work on my own terms, instead of having to go to to office to use a computer.<br />
Now I can just figure out how to telecommute&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Tuesday (12 November 2002), the extended version of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released on DVD. The standard theatrical release came out a few months ago, but this was the one I was waiting for &#8212; more material, worth the price I was going to pay.<br />
The bold idea, of course, was to really show this movie. In fact, it was about as good an excuse as any to hold the first true &#8220;Movie Night&#8221; in my house. Chris and I used to hold movie nights all the time in our apartment, but due to lack of time, space, furniture, and the fact that at times my home looked more like the aftermath of a F-5 tornado than a house pretty much kept large events at bay.<br />
Until now.<br />
This release was reason enough to drag out a considerable number of people to my home, sit down, and listen to the movie at a volume that would deafen most teenagers. The subwoofer was turned up so much the floor shook. I&#8217;m sure that if my windows didn&#8217;t have brass strip accents, they would have rattled. The room was dark, and everyone had goosepimples. It was great.<br />
We paused the movie a couple of times, one for the when Virgil&#8217;s pizza arrived, a second (much longer) time when our Chinese food arrived (it had been far too long since our last Chinese dinner), and one last time when the first disc ended.<br />
Yes, the &#8220;first&#8221; disc. The extended version is on four discs. No, the movie itself doesn&#8217;t extend across all four &#8212; just the first two. Why so long? Well, the movie itself is 208 minutes &#8212; that&#8217;s pretty long, even for a DVD. Tack on a small army of extra audio channels, and suddenly you&#8217;ve got too much information for one measly little DVD disc.<br />
So we took a slight break. I popped out the first disc, swapped in the second, and pressed play. And then I crossed my fingers.<br />
Why cross fingers? That&#8217;s to compensate for my rather bad luck. You see, I had the set still in the A&amp;B plastic bag, and sealed in its wrapper. I hadn&#8217;t opened it. I wanted to preserve it so that its first real viewing would be in front of my friends. Naturally, that meant that it wouldn&#8217;t work.<br />
Have I ever mentioned that Murphy is my best friend?<br />
At first, the disc took an inordinately long time to load. My first thought: this wasn&#8217;t loading. There, that was my problem! Oh well, my luck &#8230; the disc finished loading and the title came up on the display. Huh &#8212; how &#8217;bout that, no problem! Well&#8230; so I thought, until I heard:<br />
Them: &#8220;Geoff, you doofus! You put the first disc in!&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s the right one!&#8221; (I check the discs, just to make sure.)<br />
Them: &#8220;Then why is the first disc&#8217;s contents on-screen?&#8221;<br />
I scratched my head. The first disc was in the case. I popped the disc out. Disc Two.<br />
Me: &#8220;Ha! This is the second disc!&#8221;<br />
Them: &#8220;Ha! You should have checked your copy before inviting us over!&#8221;<br />
They had a point.<br />
It appears that A&amp;B received a batch of bad copies of the movie. Somehow, I should have expected this. In fact, I pretty much did. This is how much luck tends to go. But where there&#8217;s a will (or a great deal of stubbornness), there&#8217;s a way. A nearby Blockbuster also helps.<br />
Not surprisingly, their copies were all rented. Audrey, however, took charge, and asked if there were any copies &#8220;lying around&#8221; that we could rent. Nada. Audrey didn&#8217;t stop, and had them check other stores. One of the nearby Blockbusters had one copy remaining.<br />
A mere viewing of the movie wasn&#8217;t enough. No, we had to engage our own quest for the ring. Audrey, Adrian, Calvin, and myself braved the treacherous Fire Lights of the Tenth Road, the decaying Bridge of Bow, a hurried run past the edge of the Forest of Glass Towers, and onto the hedonistic Avenue of Drunken Morons, finally arriving at the Blockbuster of Mount Doom, er, Royal. Obtaining our movie, we headed north on 14th Aisle of Laggan, before turning into the Hamlet of Kensington, and finally to Hobbiton, I mean, my house.<br />
Lights, DVD, action!<br />
We resumed our movie, revelling in the visual and aural bombardment. The cats wisely stayed out of the living room. The movie finally ended at half-past midnight, a full hour and a half after it should have.<br />
But such is the nature of a quest &#8212; you never know when it will truly end.</p>

		<p>It doesn&#8217;t take long for me to get back into the swing of (some) things. I&#8217;m already working on trains again. This time, it&#8217;s the locomotive from which I caught the train chasing bug.<br />
I got a call from Don on Saturday, wanting the tapes I shot for 6060&#8217;s trip out to Jasper last year (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]). We chatted briefly, then mentioned that I should drop by the roundhouse at CP&#8217;s Alyth Yard to see 2816 all steamed up. Asking if the engine were heading back to Vancouver for a six-month inspection or more work, Don replied that 2816 was making a run from Calgary to Banff and back with some of CP&#8217;s executives. I was to drop by around 11:00am on Sunday.<br />
When I arrived, Don&#8217;s truck was nowhere in sight. Having never been here before, and coming at Don&#8217;s invitation &#8212; not CP&#8217;s &#8212; I was careful to wait for my escort. Don arrived shortly afterwards, and I followed him in.<br />
2816 was not out in the yard, or even on the turntable (as I&#8217;d hoped). It was tucked inside, the smokebox cover completely removed, the superheater covers removed, and four men milling around inside. Present were Bill (2816&#8217;s lead engineer), Jim (CP employee, RMRS member, and steam locomotive engineer &#8212; Jim had run 6060 to Jasper with us last year), Al Broadfoot (who supervised 2816&#8217;s overhaul), and another man who I&#8217;d never met before.<br />
It seemed that the night before, after Don had left, Bill noticed an odd noise in the smokebox. Upon investigation, he found steam eminating from one of the flue tubes. That could mean only one thing &#8212; a superheater had burst.<br />
We had arrived to find them in the midst of removing superheater tubes. Luckily, they knew exactly which one was giving them trouble, but it was tucked behind a couple of other tubes that needed to be removed first. This involved using an overhead crane for support, and a forklift for leverage. Superheater tubes, especially in larger locomotives, are extremely heavy. Removing them by hand is torture (or so I&#8217;m told by the 6060 crew, who had to do just that).<br />
I didn&#8217;t directly participate. Partly because Bill and Al don&#8217;t know me, but also because I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;ve never seen this done before, let alone participated. I fell into my role of gopher. (Which I&#8217;m quite comfortable at, especially with people who know a lot more than I do.) That basically meant a coffee run.)<br />
While all this was happening, I had long chats with Al. It would appear that my education of Al has been woefully one-sided. I&#8217;ve heard lots of stories and some generally not nice things about him. I&#8217;d always been a little skeptical &#8230; but not enough. Al seems to be a genuinely honest man, trying to keep locomotives in good running shape. This is what I gathered talking to him directly. He actually mourned the RMRS&#8217; lack of a proper shop to maintain 6060. (This is something everyone agrees with.) Needless to say, if for nothing else, I&#8217;m glad I went just so I could talk with Al.<br />
The troubled superheater soon slid out of the boiler. As it popped out and was slowly lowered to the ground, water seeped from the bend. Etched in the forged piece was a tiny hole, about 1/16th of an inch across. Possibly a thin-walled area, aggravated by a grape (a weld that has pooled into a sphere on the inside) causing an eddy, bored right through the side.<br />
Normally, this would sideline a locomotive. But with CP&#8217;s resources, it&#8217;s a matter of cutting off the offending piece and getting in a welder to attach a new bend. Jim knew a good one in town who could come the following day to fix it.<br />
We left 2816 in the roundhouse, covers off, superheaters laid out, awaiting repairs. It almost looked like a patient anxiously awaiting a dentist to fill a cavity. It&#8217;s due to run to Banff (Bamf!) on Friday. I&#8217;m pretty sure it will.</p>

		<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse me,<br />
I&#8217;m not at my best.<br />
I&#8217;ve been gone for a month,<br />
I&#8217;ve been drunk since I left.<br />
These so-called vacations<br />
will soon be my death.<br />
I&#8217;m so sick from the drink,<br />
I need home for a rest.<br />

</p></blockquote>
<p>I arrived in Calgary last night at 8:30pm. It was dark, cold, dry, and I was harbouring my second illness in a month. The snow that fell here only days ago was gone (thankfully &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for that yet). But it already felt like home.<br />
My house was full again, the shipment of furnishings from my mom&#8217;s house having arrived during my absence. (Thank goodness for roommates.) The cats were cranky, but they&#8217;ve been that way since Spaz arrived. I&#8217;m doing something about that tonight. I walked into my room, tasted the smell of used kitty litter, and flopped down on my bed &#8212; the cloud of dust it kicked up had me coughing for a few minutes. But it felt like home.<br />
My last week in Halifax had been eventful, even when all I did was watch the Queen&#8217;s Gala on CBC. I took another train (no, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised). I saw Halifax, Lunenburg, Peggy&#8217;s Cove, and the Bay of Fundy. I crossed Cape Breton twice. I met more amazing people. I bought seafood and travelled to Huntsville for a family Thanksgiving. (My apologies to those of you in Toronto &#8212; it was a last-minute decision, and I didn&#8217;t venture any further south than gate B20 of Terminal 3.) As I sat in the plane last night, taxiing down the runway, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get home.<br />
This morning, it was minus two degrees outside. The leaves that were green when I left are now gone, dropped to the ground and neatly packed away in the garage (see previous comment about roommates). The walk to work seemed completely new, yet totally familiar (as it should be). My legs hurt from the walking. You&#8217;d think after a month of wandering around I wouldn&#8217;t notice.<br />
The office hasn&#8217;t changed much. A couple new faces, others on their way out &#8212; nothing out of the ordinary. My project hasn&#8217;t moved forward one iota. I joked with a colleague that I was going to leave a sealed envelope with a message that read: &#8220;Nothing will change while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221; Our laughter was nervous, because we both know the truth.<br />
Flipping on my computer, I was greeted with a cacophony of error messages. It seems my nicely drafted message to keep dirty paws off my computer hadn&#8217;t helped. The IT department felt it necessary to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; my computer in my absence, leaving me with a broken computer to return to. No email for me to start the day.<br />
The calendar might say &#8220;Tuesday&#8221;, but it feels like a Monday.<br />
Meetings at 10:00, lunch at 11:30, fires burning by 1:00. Three projects that are in dire straits already need my attention. I don&#8217;t even know what the hell&#8217;s been going on for the last month! So goes the story around here: Sink or Swim.<br />
Every person asks the same question: How was the trip? I give the token answer: Awesome! Great! Stupendous! Life-altering experience! But none of the answers come close to what I really want to say: You will never understand until you&#8217;ve done it yourself. I don&#8217;t want to let people down like that. I can show them all the 80 pages of journal entries and the over 2,500 pictures I took. But it doesn&#8217;t get the same feeling, the same idea. Everyone wants to see the documentary. I tell them one might be coming, but I haven&#8217;t heard for sure. Most seem to want to see a five episode series that covers every aspect. I can only hope.<br />
Email is restored through a borrowed laptop. It&#8217;s quirky to say the least, and half the functionality I need is missing. But I can at least try to figure out what few things have transpired in the last 45 days. It&#8217;s only 765 messages (a record low for the period of time), but a lot of people knew I wouldn&#8217;t be answering. Most are CCs or bulk TO lines. And spam. Drat.<br />
The cold is worsening. Throat&#8217;s killing me. Mint tea helps, but barely. I&#8217;m thinking tracheotomy. Head spins (or the room, still not sure which), blood drains from my face, and I resist the urge to sneeze for fear my throat might explode. Why couldn&#8217;t I just get the same cold I had on the train? That one was manageable.<br />
Despite the harsh weather, the harsh illness, and the harsh reality of being home again, I can honestly say I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m happy that I had the opportunity and the honour of being with the CBC and celebrating 50 years of television. I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ve found more people I can call friends.<br />
The adventure is finally over. For now, anyway. A little quiet time with the nose on the wheel will probably do me some good. If anything, it&#8217;ll make me appreciate the trip even more.<br />
The saying goes, the journey is half the fun of getting there. The trip was more than half of that fun. But a little should be reserved for getting home. Although perhaps not so much fun as it is comforting.<br />
Be it ever so humble (and cluttered, and smelly), there&#8217;s no place like home.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been on the road far too long.<br />
Last night was Thanksgiving dinner up at the cottage. Good food, family, friend (there was only one), and good times. Even better sleep, in my old bed (since co-opted for use in the loft).<br />
Mom and Cathy drove me down to the airport. We made a side trip to see a rather uninteresting antique dealer in Gravenhurst. Aside from that and a couple of bathroom breaks, we made Pearson in a fairly good time.<br />
We grabbed a late lunch at Swiss Chalet. I checked my luggage after eating, and we switched to the bar.<br />
Even though I was at the airport, boarding pass to Calgary in hand, I didn&#8217;t really feel like I was going anywhere. I was in a bar with my family, as I&#8217;ve been (a few too) many times this year.<br />
Mom and Cathy were soon off for Oakville, leaving me to wait for my flight. (We left early to beat the returning weekend traffic. We left perhaps a little too early.)<br />
I waited at gate B20 for about an hour, reading Wired. Nothing out of the ordinary (at least for me, lately). Even when WestJet staff started yelling for passengers (the microphone to the PA system wasn&#8217;t working), there was no rush. For me, it&#8217;s all routine.<br />
I think I&#8217;ve actually travelled too much this year.<br />
But as I boarded the plane and took my seat, a feeling of reserved relief crept upon me. I&#8217;m going home. My month and a half abroad is ending in a few short hours. Tonight I will sleep in my own bed in my own home. I will see my cats. (Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll have to go back to my job &#8212; hey, it can&#8217;t all be roses.)<br />
I&#8217;m tired. Take me home. Please.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate alarms. Especially when they go off while you&#8217;ve still got an hour of darkness left of the night. I had an early flight to Toronto, though, and wasn&#8217;t keen on missing it.<br />
I had packed the night before, so all I had to do was shave, shower, dress, and throw all my bags in the trunk of my rented car. Checking out was trivial, just the way I like it. Then it was off to the airport.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where either my unbelievably good sense of direction, or my unbelievable stupidity, shows through. Most normal people would ask where the airport is and how to get there. Not me. I decided I could find it based on the solitary sign I&#8217;d seen on the Highway 102/103 interchange yesterday. Oh, I should mention that it was still dark when I entered the highway, and the radio was calling for dense patches of fog &#8230; about 10 seconds before I ran into one myself.<br />
So I drove north. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was even going to the correct airport. (I didn&#8217;t know how many airports were in the Halifax area.) For a short time, I considered turning off to get directions. But something kept me going. I found my way to the airport, though. The correct one, at that!<br />
One of these days, this behaviour is going to get me into trouble. Big trouble.<br />
Checking in was fast, as was picking up the seafood feast I was bringing back to Ontario. Five lobster, two pounds of mussels, and a pound of scallops. And so help me, none of it cooked in butter. (Not counting sautéing the onions and garlic for the white wine sauce.) The box the seafood came in, however, needed to be taken on the plane. Along with my two carry-on bags. This was over my limit, and a bit of worry. Luckily, the plane was only about three-quarters full. The staff didn&#8217;t stop me.<br />
Toronto came quickly, and I was soon waiting in the baggage claim with my three carry-ons. My duffle bag was the first bag off. My knapsack was significantly later. As I exited baggage claim, my mother came in the main doors. Five minutes later mom, Cathy, and I were on our way north.<br />
I was goaded into coming back to Ontario for Thanksgiving. I wanted to go home to Calgary. I&#8217;ve been away for a month and a half, and I want adjustment time. But somewhere in the back of my mind, staying for a couple of days in Huntsville seemed like a good idea. I gave into pressure and decided to come in. However, I&#8217;ll probably only see the airport, the highway, and the cottage. I doubt I&#8217;ll see anything else, or anyone else.<br />
The ride north was uneventful, save for the Teeming Thousands who were similarly heading north. The traffic, according to Cathy, wasn&#8217;t too bad though. On long weekends during the summer, you simply just don&#8217;t go up on Saturday&#8217;s. It&#8217;s just shy of declaring insanity. When we hit the Highway 69/Highway 11 split, the traffic lightened. The rest of the trip wasn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
At Orillia, I convinced Cathy that we needed to stop for lunch. I hadn&#8217;t eaten a thing since leaving Halifax, and it was now 3:00pm according to my stomach. This meant, of course, a stop at Weber&#8217;s &#8212; an institution in this part of Ontario. Virtually everyone who&#8217;s driven this stretch of highway more than once has eaten at Weber&#8217;s. And for good reason: it&#8217;s fast, fresh, and good.<br />
We were in Huntsville about an hour later. After a quick stop for beer (I&#8217;m a picky drinker), we made the long trek out to the cottage. It&#8217;s a bit of a hike &#8212; a lot longer than I remembered from my last journey out here (see [[Visit to Ontario, Cottage in Huntsville, Thanksgiving Dinner, Algonquin Park]]). But the cottage was as I remembered it. The outside, anyway. Cathy and Craig (mostly Craig) have put in a huge amount of renovation. It&#8217;s not done yet, but one day it&#8217;s going to be the smartest-looking small cabin on Lake Vernon.<br />
Craig was already there, having been doing yard work for most of the day. Bear and Kylie (both dogs) raced out of the woods to greet us. Within minutes of being inside, I started to feel a little more relaxed. I still wanted to go home to Calgary, though. I guess all this travel has just left me feeling a little tired.<br />
The renovations were awesome. The kitchen was totally different, the floor all tiled, and the bathroom looked almost totally new. (Well,it practically is.) Still, some work was still needed, including the walls of the living room and dining room, and the downstairs. But one thing at a time.<br />
Dave arrived not long after, Chuckie (Dave&#8217;s dog) in tow. Anne and Rebecca arrived not long after. We chatted and made fun of each other until it was time to get cooking. Which was when the lobster pot finally got to a boil &#8212; after being on the burners for about three hours.<br />
Lobsters: about 10 minutes. Mussels: about 7 minutes. Scallops: about two minutes. Time to eat it all: about an hour and a half. But worth it, if for no other reason than it cleared out the memory of the scallops I had in Lunenburg. We had no room for dessert.<br />
The fun continued after dinner as we resumed making fun of each other. I didn&#8217;t participate as much, being quite tired from everything (and the alcohol not helping much). It was a good time, but I didn&#8217;t really feel all that relaxed. I still wanted to go home. Maybe tomorrow, I won&#8217;t feel so uptight.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of these days, I&#8217;m going to remember to stop booking things at the last minute. I wanted to go to Lunenburg. I wasn&#8217;t about to take a taxi &#8211; it&#8217;s a little far for that. A car was the only real solution I could think of. But finding a car wasn&#8217;t easy. Especially on the Friday of the Thanksgiving long weekend. I ended up with a compact car from Budget. Not the best deal, but it was a car.<br />
My first stop, however, wasn&#8217;t Lunenburg. It was Point Pleasant, at the tip of the Halifax peninsula. My goal was to find an anchor. According to the story I&#8217;d heard, it was an anchor from one of the ships destroyed in the Halifax explosion. The anchor, supposedly, had been thrown the three-odd miles to land in the park. I never found that anchor (it might just be a story), but there is an anchor from one of Canada&#8217;s long-decommissioned aircraft carriers.<br />
The park is also full of Halifax history, from the old battlements used during the 1700s to the rotting dugouts from WWII. One of the oddest things to see is Prince of Wales Tower. It&#8217;s not a tower per se (it looms more than it towers), and doesn&#8217;t even come close to meeting the surrounding tree height. It&#8217;s a squat little erection that looks almost like a giant&#8217;s footstool. Once upon a time, it had been support for the other British battlements around the Halifax harbour. It later became a depot magazine, which ironically is what saved the tower from being torn down.<br />
Leaving Halifax was a bit of a challenge. Although it was during the day, the traffic was such that movement was slow. Interestingly enough, a local CBC reporter tried to get my input on the problem while I was stopped at a light. She was quite frustrated to learn I was only a tourist. (I got the feeling she was having trouble getting the input she needed.)<br />
Soon I was on the highway heading south. I had no real idea of where I was going. I only knew that Lunenburg was about an hour south of Halifax. Luckily, there&#8217;s an invention called a road sign that readily provides information for drivers too stupid (or cheap) to buy a map.<br />
I ended up passing through Mahone Bay. This time, I took the road out of town that we&#8217;d avoided. A little over 10 kilometres down the road, the houses of historic Lunenburg soon lined the streets.<br />
Downtown Lunenburg is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The houses are kept in immaculate (original) condition, as are the museums and restaurants. There&#8217;s even a Subway restaurant that you&#8217;d miss if you weren&#8217;t looking. The ships sitting in the harbour, including the Bluenose II, only accent the feeling.<br />
My first stop was for lunch. Having yet again skipped breakfast, I needed to eat. I stopped at a place Daryl had recommended a while back. Although it looked like a good establishment, I was extremely disappointed with the meal. I&#8217;m sure that somewhere, someone likes vegetables boiled in butter. My stomach was flip-flopping the rest of the day.<br />
I visited the Fisheries Museum next. Built into what was probably a canning plant from the heyday of Lunenburg fishing, you&#8217;d almost never know what you were looking at, were it not for the signs. It&#8217;s a quaint little place that shows what it was like to fish on the east coast, equipment and all.<br />
On the waterfront are a pair of boats owned by the museum. One is the Cape Sable, a retired fishing vessel. I&#8217;ve seen &#8220;The Perfect Storm&#8221;, so I thought I had an idea of what a fishing ship looked like. But there is a certain reality when you look at the tiny compartments that these men lived in. The Captain&#8217;s room, though large, was little different than those of the other officers. The bed was the same as everyone else&#8217;s. The interior was almost enough to kill off any thoughts of ever living a life on the ocean.<br />
I held off seeing the best until the end &#8211; the Bluenose II. I remember little of the Bluenose. The last time I saw the ship, I was eight years old in Halifax. Although sealed for the winter, you could still make out the distinctive hull, the masts, and getting right up next to the ship, you could see the deck and its contents without trouble. But I would not board the Bluenose this visit. That will have to wait until my return to Nova Scotia.<br />
Before heading back towards Halifax, I rounded the bay so I could get a picture of Lunenburg with the town glowing in the sunlight. I was not disappointed, though I would have liked to have been a little higher up. You get what you can.<br />
My next stop was Peggy&#8217;s Cove. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Hadn&#8217;t I already visited there? I had, but an idea crossed my mind that drew me back. One of the signs in the post office in the Peggy&#8217;s Cove lighthouse said that letters posted in either the lighthouse or the mailbox next to the gift shop would receive the Peggy&#8217;s Cove cancellation. At the time, it hadn&#8217;t really sunk in. The idea of sending a postcard to friends and family from Peggy&#8217;s Cove really appealed to me, and was the sole reason I went back.<br />
The good weather was welcome, though. As much as I like the pictures I took a week ago, the setting sun provided some wonderful angles and bright light, backing onto the blue sky. Even black and white pictures looked better.<br />
Returning to Halifax along Highway 333, I found my way directly to my hotel. I ditched the car in favour of walking downtown for dinner. Still trying to ditch the icky feeling from lunch, I opted for the cleanest food I know and love: sushi, at Hamachi House. A little green tea, a little tempura, and couple rolls of some of the freshest fish I&#8217;ve ever had.<br />
I sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant was quite full, with people all around the bar. But no-one I knew. I&#8217;ve gotten used to eating in restaurants on my own, but it doesn&#8217;t ease the loneliness. After being with people for the last month, travelling on my own left me feeling a little more empty than I like.<br />
Tomorrow, I begin my long journey home. That&#8217;s pretty much what&#8217;s keeping me going right now. I&#8217;m tired. Tired of the waiting, the pacing, the walking, the seeing, the doing. I never thought I&#8217;d hear myself say this, but I want to go back to a job that drives me crazy &#8211; at least it&#8217;s predictable.</p>

		<p>Sleeping in is good. Too bad I didn&#8217;t sleep in. Instead, I woke around 8:30 and began to get on with the day. The first order of business was typing out some of the journal entries I was behind on. The second was making the CD-ROM for Ken. The last was making arrangements to visit with a friend of a friend.<br />
The sky was overcast, but threatened no rain. In fact, the clouds were so thin that I had to wear sunglasses to cut down on the glare. I hiked down to the VIA station, where I dropped off the CD-ROM and a card for the Bras D&#8217;or crew. Then it was off to resume my tour of Halifax.<br />
I wandered down Lower Water Street, zipping in and out of various shops and courtyards. I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything in particular, but was curious to see what was there.<br />
Several of the wharves are no longer in active use, save for the odd tour boat. The rest are permanent (or semi-permanent) moorings for vessels of historical significance. Some are tied with the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, such as the CSS Acadia. There is also a permanent berth for the Bluenose II, even though the Bluenose itself was in Lunenburg for the winter.<br />
During my jaunt, I found Canada&#8217;s first and only mouth-blown crystal manufacturer, Nova Scotian Crystal. They keep their garage door open so people can peer inside to see the process at work. I could barely see with all the onlookers, and moved on.<br />
I ended up doubling back on my route, but going down Lower Water Street instead of along the boardwalk. I arrived back at Brewery Market, and thought I&#8217;d take another look inside. Although I wasn&#8217;t going to take the brewery tour again, there had been several shops that had been closed the last time I was there. With a sign that read &#8220;Maritime Handicrafts&#8221;, I decided a peek was in order.<br />
As I rounded the corner, what did my peering eyes spy, but a new friend: Stephanie. She had mentioned that she worked in a jewellery store the day before. This wasn&#8217;t exactly a jewellery store, but had some jewellery for sale. Not interested in such baubles, I concentrated on the handicrafts. We talked while she showed me the wares. But there wasn&#8217;t much there that I saw of interest.<br />
Instead of helping me buy something I didn&#8217;t want, Stephanie directed me to Spring Garden Road. She quietly said that there was more there for me to see, and I could also tackle my lunch problem. As a convenient bonus, I was also to meet my contact at the Second Cup on Spring Garden at 3:00 &#8211; a scant half hour away.<br />
There were many shops on Spring Garden, including Jennifer&#8217;s of Nova Scotia (the best gift shop I saw in Nova Scotia) and HMV (where I had to strongly resist the urge to buy something). Being almost time, I headed over to the Second Cup.<br />
I had never met Jiye before, nor had I even seen a picture. She&#8217;s a good friend of my good friend Kim. (Kim had asked that if time I allowed that I meet Jiye.) Luckily, it was easy to spot Jiye &#8211; she was the only young Chinese woman standing out in front looking for someone.<br />
I had loosely planned to spend only a half hour with Jiye. Not that I didn&#8217;t want to meet her, but I wanted to get to the Halifax Citadel before it closed at 5:00, and have enough time to actually see it. But we got so deeply engaged in conversation that time completely vanished. It was nearly 4:00 when we finally broke and parted ways.<br />
I hope Jiye does well in Halifax. She had moved there, following her PhD advisor, who had come to Dalhousie. She was finding the experience difficult, since she didn&#8217;t know the city, had no friends, and didn&#8217;t have much of a social life. As Jiye wasn&#8217;t enrolled at Dalhousie, she couldn&#8217;t take courses either, making meeting people difficult. I offered some advice, hoping that it might make her life on the east coast a little more bearable.<br />
Jiye returned to her apartment, and I headed up the hill to the Citadel. By the time I got there, I had barely 40 minutes of time until it closed. Deciding that a half-hour was better than no visit at all, I attempted to purchase a ticket. I say &#8220;attempted&#8221; because I wasn&#8217;t actually able to buy my way in &#8230; in the last half hour, the fee is waived. Who said there&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch?<br />
The Halifax Citadel isn&#8217;t as polished as La Citadelle in Quebec City. Where La Citadelle is immense, and made of smooth-faced granite blocks, the Halifax Citadel is mostly rough rectangular stones. The Citadel is no longer in active service, unlike Quebec City, so is preserved in its original state. It&#8217;s a neat place to visit.<br />
The museum portions of the Citadel are quite extensive. You could easily spend most of a day just wandering in and out of the honeycomb of rooms. With my general lack of time, I did what my sister and brother-and-law do in museums: Look and keep walking. I tried to speed-read certain things, but didn&#8217;t take in too much.<br />
A whistle in the courtyard announced the five-minute warning. I snapped pictures hurriedly, and scooted out the door as it was being locked behind me. More pictures of the outer walls and the moat, and then of the town clock, just down the hill from the Citadel. Then further down the hill to the waterfront again, where I started to plan my evening activities.<br />
One thing I wanted was a picture of Halifax at night from the other side of the harbour. That mean taking a ferry. The question was, which ferry to which port? There are two: one to Dartmouth and a second to Woodside. If I&#8217;d ever been on the other side of the harbour before, I couldn&#8217;t remember. The other thing I needed to do was eat. I still hadn&#8217;t had breakfast or lunch, and was getting a little peckish.<br />
My plan was: eat, take a ferry across to the other side, snap pictures, come back, and wind my way back to the hotel. Seemed like a simple plan. The key was in the timing. I had to wait until it was dark enough to get the full effect of the lights at night. It was too early to begin even dinner, so I took the opportunity to walk further down the boardwalk, past the casino, all the way to the naval base. (An American aircraft carrier was in port, and I was curious to see which one. I never did find out &#8211; the name appeared hidden.)<br />
About an hour later, I pulled into a small pub and grill on the boardwalk to satisfy my hunger. Mussels, salmon, and some bread did a satisfactory job. My waiter was extremely helpful in solving my other question &#8211; apparently Dartmouth offered a better view of downtown.<br />
The ferries that run across the harbour are small &#8211; about twice the size of the SeaBus in Vancouver, about half the size of the Toronto Harbour ferries. No vehicles (except bikes), and meant for commuters. The ferries have been running for 250 years. Originally, it was a teamboat &#8211; a ship propelled by a team of eight horses. Now it&#8217;s a small fleet of bi-directional diesel-powered vessels.<br />
The trip is short &#8211; only 10 minutes or so. But the waiter had been accurate &#8212; the view was spectacular. It was also much closer to the bridge, which I also wanted to get pictures of. I took up position at the end of a wharf, and took pictures until the next ferry arrived almost a half hour later.<br />
The trip back was better than the trip over. This time I faced Halifax. The buildings cast bright lights onto the harbour. The naval vessels glowed at their edges. And as a treat, we were passed by a half-full Hapag-Lloyd container ship. Then it was off around the downtown again, slowly winding my way back towards the hotel.<br />
When I&#8217;d parted company with the Bras D&#8217;or crew, I had taken a bit of a gamble and left my name and phone number with Stephanie. My hope was that she might call, even though my expectation was that she wouldn&#8217;t. Stephanie and Angela were fighting off a nasty cold both days on the train. Even when I&#8217;d found Stephanie earlier in the day, she&#8217;d reiterated the need to get rest. But ever the optimist, I thought I&#8217;d take a chance.<br />
That, and I was tired of wandering around. I wanted to sit down a while.<br />
I ended up watching the Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s visit to the CBC Broadcast Centre in Toronto (looking around the audience for people I knew), and then the Gala Celebration at Roy Thompson Hall. It was a beautiful show, and really showcased some of the best of Canadian talent. It made me feel inadequate about my artistic abilities, which are generally pretty lousy.<br />
I fell asleep with the TV on. Probably a good thing. I had a lot of driving ahead of me.</p>

		<p>It was still dark when the alarm clock (bolted to the night table) tuned in the local classic rock station. Great thing about radio &#8211; there&#8217;s always a classic rock station available.</p>
<p>Showered and bags packed, I hiked my way back to the train. It wasn&#8217;t too far, and with only two bags wasn&#8217;t a big deal. As I neared the train station (barely more than a plywood lean-to with a small painted sign that reads &#8220;Sydney&#8221;), I began to wonder if the train departed from the same station. I didn&#8217;t see anyone on the platform, so I couldn&#8217;t be sure.</p>
<p>Pressing on, I turned the corner and crossed the tracks. As I did, I could hear the bell of the locomotive as the train approached. A little more relieved, I then noticed some of the crew and passengers waiting on the platform. I felt much more relieved. The train and I arrived at the same time.</p>
<p>Ken was there to greet us as we boarded. Lisa, Joanne, and Desmond were elsewhere on board, no doubt preparing for the day&#8217;s events. There was no sign of either Angela or Stephanie at first, but I had little doubt they&#8217;d miss the trip.</p>
<p>As the staff passed by, I bade them each a good morning, which they returned. Only unlike most of the other passengers, they used my name. I felt for a while like I was home again, with friends who know who knew me.</p>
<p>The train left on time, and began to retrace the route from yesterday. Breakfast soon appeared, and just as soon disappeared. Once the tray was gone, I began wandering again. I passed by the rail fan who Ken had been wary of the day before. He cast me a look that wasn&#8217;t quite dirty, but certainly wasn&#8217;t hospitable. (Ken would later sternly instruct the man that he was to remain seated while in the domes &#8211; he was regularly standing at the top of the staircase, blocking not only entry and exit, but also the view from other passengers.)</p>
<p>I returned to the coffee shop, where the staff was beginning to congregate again. Conversations resumed as we watched the scenery go by. Lisa had brought snacks: her mother&#8217;s cherry poundcake (absolutely luscious) and cookies called &#8220;fat archies&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never had a fat archie before. Lisa calls it a &#8220;molasses raisin cookie&#8221;. It has a healthy dose of cinnamon, and is almost like eating a small cake. I&#8217;m not a big fan of raisin cookies, but I could eat a whole tin of fat archies. Wow.</p>
<p>Lisa&#8217;s parents were also along for the ride. They were just like the rest of the Bras D&#8217;or crew &#8211; extremely friendly and very hospitable. Must be a Cape Breton thing. Lisa&#8217;s mom would later sing along with Stephanie, Angela, and Lisa, and her father would play his keyboard during the jam session in the coffee shop later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our first stop was in Orangedale. Again, the passengers disembarked, looked around, and listened as Stephanie, Angela, Lisa, and Lisa&#8217;s mom sang some of the traditional songs of Cape Breton.</p>
<p>Back on the train, we headed to Port Hawkesbury. The scenery was stunning. Although mostly cloudy, the sun managed to peek through enough to make everything seem somehow more magical. Hawks and bald eagles flew alongside the train, swooping and diving in some aerial ballet, playing with the sunbeams that pocked regularly through the clouds.</p>
<p>Not everyone climbed out at Port Hawkesbury. I suspect those who didn&#8217;t had been there the day before, and saw nothing to see again. I climbed out, but really only for one purpose: take a picture of the crew. Yesterday, Ken had asked me to take pictures of the scenery for him. I figured he also needed a picture of the crew. Especially if this is to be the last crew of the Bras D&#8217;or.</p>
<p>Shortly after crossing the Canso Causeway, we received lunch. Chicken for me, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for the seafood trio I&#8217;d had the day before. And only one cup of wine this time &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to be stumbling around the train. The meal, the wine, and the light rocking of the train soon did me in, and I was out. I woke as we started passing through Antigonish.</p>
<p>Returning again to the coffee shop, I found only a couple people present. The rest were off tending to duties. I chatted with Angela. I was curious to see what I was missing in the tour. This was the job Angela used to fulfill, before VIA installed the automated system. Angela shrugged and replied: &#8220;Not much&#8221;, saying the only thing the automated system didn&#8217;t include were the stories.</p>
<p>The second music session began a few minutes later in the Laurentide Park car. It was almost reminiscent of the jam session we&#8217;d had on the CBC train coming out of Edmonton. Just not as raucous. (I was still the youngest person on board, although there were a few more younger people.) I sat in the last seat of the dome, and listened from above. I think I recognised two songs the entire session. All beautiful, but few familiar.</p>
<p>When the group broke up, I headed to the Skyline lounge to watch the passing countryside. (The rail fan was back at the top of the stairs again. I opted not to say anything.) As I peered out the window, Angela came by and sat down for a moment. She asked if I were bored. This had to be the most surprising question I&#8217;d been asked since I left Calgary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would I be bored?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you saw the same thing yesterday, only in reverse. What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; Angela returned.</p>
<p>She had a good point &#8211; I had seen (more or less) the same thing the day before. But there were a few things that she hadn&#8217;t considered. Angela rides the train for five months a year, twice a week (once in each direction). So immediately, that makes the trip a little dull for her. I&#8217;ve never seen any of it before. I had also made a point of getting to know the staff. Not because it would be advantageous to me (though it most certainly was), but because then I&#8217;d have someone to talk to, and hopefully meet new friends. Good conversation, carefree play, and good jokes make even 10 hour trips disappear.</p>
<p>Shortly after Truro came the jam session. As many people as could squeeze into the coffee shop grouped around Stephanie, Angela, and Lisa&#8217;s father. For the next hour and a half, they played whatever songs came to mind, including &#8220;American Pie&#8221; and what almost seems to be the theme song of Nova Scotia, &#8220;Barrett&#8217;s Privateers&#8221; (I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times I&#8217;ve heard the song since arriving.)</p>
<p>In the last hour, souvenirs came out for sale, and the staff began to pack up things no longer in use. Before long, Bedford Basin came into view. Everything was being packed away. Ken even commented on packing things away in his &#8220;tickle trunk&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if he said that for my benefit or not.</p>
<p>The last vestiges of the CBC train were gone. Skyline 8502, Banff Park, the museum cars, the baggage car, and the coach car had still been in the station yesterday. (Locomotive #6403 and the generator car had left by then.) The only thing left of the trip in Halifax was me.</p>
<p>I was sad to leave the train. I had made new friends, who had treated me exceptionally well. I bade them all farewell, and promised to drop off a CD-ROM of the pictures I took to the VIA office the following day.</p>
<p>In lieu of a taxi, I hiked back to the hotel. I found this not only good exercise, but a great way to prevent aggravation. Getting a taxi at the train station is almost like waiting for Godot.</p>
<p>Exhausted from my trip, I&#8217;m staying in tonight, and ordering room service (it was a small pizza, nothing fancy). And laundry. (When you run out of clean underwear, it&#8217;s laundry time.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Waking early after a few days of sleeping in (even if just a little) was difficult. But given the day&#8217;s activity, I couldn&#8217;t wait. I was taking a train.<br />
Yes, a train. A month on the CBC special hadn&#8217;t dampened my spirit one bit. And the free coupon one of the VIA product managers had arranged for me gave me the perfect opportunity to ride more trains. (If I could, I&#8217;d probably take the train back to Calgary.)<br />
The Bras D&#8217;or (in English, &#8220;Golden Arm&#8221;) is a rail cruise VIA runs from Halifax to Sydney in Cape Breton. It&#8217;s a 10 hour ride, arriving in the early evening. You spend the whole day on the train, save for one scheduled stop at Port Hawkesbury.<br />
I was the youngest person in the waiting room. A seniors tour was on the train, as were several other couples travelling on their own. There were two or three others, not counting myself, who didn&#8217;t have grey hair. But that was fine with me.<br />
This was the first train I would board where I didn&#8217;t know anyone &#8211; not the crew, not the passengers. It was a peculiar feeling. No more unsettling than how the interior mirrored the CBC train. The coach cars had extremely similar layouts, but none of the clutter. The Skyline car (#8505) was a spitting image of the one we&#8217;d had (#8502), except for the TV in the coffee shop. The Laurentide Park is a bare six digits in serial numbers from the Banff Park &#8230; the only visible difference is the painting in the Mural Lounge. It almost felt like home.<br />
Breakfast, in the form of fresh fruit and a small bowl of cereal, came not long after departure. We rounded the Bedford Basin and began our trip out to Truro. From there, we&#8217;d go through Stellarton, New Glasgow, Antigonish, before arriving at the Canso Causeway. We&#8217;d cross into Cape Breton and pause for a while at Port Hawkesbury. Then north(ish) through Cape Breton to North Sydney, Sydney Mines, and then into Sydney itself.<br />
I started wandering about not long after the empty breakfast tray was taken away. I found the dome cars in marginal condition &#8211; the glass was either blurred or contained many small cracks. The windows are a decade old, and are in need of replacement. The scenery is no less beautiful, just difficult to take pictures of through the windows.<br />
I ended up in the coffee shop of the Skyline car, where the windows are large, very clean, and defect-free. Not a perfect place to take pictures, but there was an added benefit &#8211; this was where the crew sat when not doing rounds. They recognized my CBC vest. They asked if I had been on the CBC special.<br />
The next few hours passed quickly as I slowly got to know the crew. There was the Service Manager, Ken, and his staff Lisa, Joanne, and Desmond. (Desmond is also a service manager, but wanted the quieter trip of the Bras D&#8217;or, and takes a seat behind Ken, who has more seniority.) But that&#8217;s not the entire crew &#8211; two of Cape Breton&#8217;s finest represent Cape Breton Tourism on board, Angela and Stephanie.<br />
By the time lunch had rolled around, I had gotten to know some of the staff; listened as Stephanie, Angela, and Lisa tried to write down the lyrics to &#8220;Coal Town Road&#8221;, a traditional Cape Breton tune; and been offered a rail fan&#8217;s dream. While Ken and I discussed some of the finer points of rail travel, he leaned in, grinned, and asked if I&#8217;d like to see the cab. I thought he meant while we were stopped. He meant while we were running.<br />
Amongst rail fans, a cab ride is like winning an Oscar. It&#8217;s an award bestowed by your peers, and an honour to be treasured. Mostly because the official route in getting a cab ride is long, convoluted, and extremely difficult. (We found this out on the CBC train when we tried to get Daryl into the cab to shoot video.) I did my best to agree eagerly, without looking too eager.<br />
This was kept very hushed, because there was a problem with Ken letting me go in the cab. And it wasn&#8217;t the engineers &#8211; it was another rail fan. Another man on board, from the Hillsborough and Salem Railroad, is what rail fans describe as a &#8220;foamer&#8221; &#8211; someone who foams at the mouth when talking about trains. They&#8217;re a little too fanatic to trust entirely. This guy had been pestering Ken since the trip started to go in the cab, but there was no way Ken was letting him in the cab. I guess I was calm and patient enough to be deemed &#8220;safe&#8221;. The trick was getting me in the engine without anyone seeing me.<br />
But I would wait until after lunch, which was served just out of Antigonish. It was wonderful to just sit and watch the countryside go by. The explosion of colours were already visible in the vast forests. The most fantastic reds, fresh greens, and bold yellows I&#8217;ve ever seen. We&#8217;re only in the early stages of fall here in Nova Scotia &#8211; I can only imagine what it will look like in a week or two.<br />
Lunch was cold, but no less delicious. I&#8217;d never had cold scallops before. A little chewy perhaps, but still tasty. It even came with a selection of local wines from the Jost Vineyards. (I have to say that while I did end up having both the white and the red, neither rated particularly high with me. I thought we&#8217;d have to rotate through the Skyline coffee shop, as we&#8217;d done with the CBC, but the staff delivered it to our seats.<br />
The Canso Causeway was built in the 1950s to join Cape Breton Island with Nova Scotia. It&#8217;s was a huge project. Due to the depth of the chasm, no bridge would work. Instead, rocks fill the massive gap allowing for a highway and a rail crossing. A small canal allows transit from one side to the other through locks. The locks don&#8217;t control water levels, just ensure that the current is controlled.<br />
Port Hawkesbury isn&#8217;t really much of a stop. But it&#8217;s necessary to change out crews. The rail line runs on CN to Truro, then on CB&amp;CNS north to Sydney. The Cape Breton crew comes on at Port Hawkesbury. That means a half hour for us to wander around and do very little.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s supposed to be an hour. But Port Hawkesbury isn&#8217;t exactly a riveting location. That&#8217;s why the stop is only 30 minutes. The rest of the stop comes a few miles down the line at Orangedale.<br />
Orangedale is a small community, but somehow has ended up with the best rail museum in Nova Scotia. It&#8217;s not large by any means, but has preserved the station building in its original state, and has several pieces of rolling stock on their grounds.<br />
But that&#8217;s not all. As part of our stop, we get a mini-concert. When the Bras D&#8217;or originally started three years ago, Cape Breton Tourism staff would act as tour guides, pointing out interesting features and telling stories. Today, the system is mostly automated. According to Angela, it does a pretty good job. As a result, Stephanie and Angela&#8217;s jobs are somewhat reduced.<br />
One of their jobs is to sing traditional songs from Cape Breton and Nova Scotia. Stephanie is an accomplished guitarist, and sings like an angel. (Stephanie is moving to Toronto in October. Music industry, please take note!) I couldn&#8217;t help but stop and listen for a time. Even when I wasn&#8217;t in the station house, you could hear her voice clearly.<br />
Resuming our trip, Ken pulled me aside and asked me to hide for a few minutes in the kitchen. That&#8217;s when Howie appeared. Howie was one of the two engineers, and had come down to get snacks and coffee for him and Everett, the other engineer. The two of them led me through the coach cars, and through the baggage car (it&#8217;s quite odd to see one of those empty). At this point, I put in my earplugs, and followed Howie into the engine room of #6409, the train&#8217;s sole locomotive.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d been inside an engine room was with Peter in Melville. It had been loud then, and the engine was idling. Now it was under load. Howie had been through there so many times it probably didn&#8217;t faze him at all. I was glad to have earplugs. We emerged into the cab, where Everett met me with a big smile. Howie immediately offered me his seat on the left side &#8211; Howie sat in a fold-down seat mounted to the rear wall.<br />
Riding in a cab really brings the idea of an &#8220;iron horse&#8221; to reality. The ride is not smooth (especially on rough track), and even with shock-absorbed seats, I nearly flew out of my chair more than once. Howie and Everett didn&#8217;t seem to have any trouble at all. (Of course, they make regular runs on this stretch of the CB&amp;CNS and know every little detail. While I was missing the tour on the train, I was receiving my own personal version from the engineers.)<br />
The scenery around Bras D&#8217;or Lake is almost indescribable. I&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it. Reminiscent of the west coast, northern Ontario, Lake Ontario, and Scotland all rolled into one. (I&#8217;m going on assumptions of Scotland, mind you. I haven&#8217;t been there, but I have seen many pictures and video.) And with the fall colours beginning to take hold, it&#8217;s a gorgeous place to witness first hand.<br />
Which made my trip all the more poignant. Little did I know when I boarded the train this morning that the Bras D&#8217;or might be meeting the same fate as BC Rail&#8217;s Cariboo Prospector. CB&amp;CNS wants to abandon the line north of Port Hawkesbury, due to lack of income (most of the mines on Cape Breton have closed) and maintenance. Right now, there are two freight trains and one passenger train a week.<br />
That would mean that next week could be the final run of the Bras D&#8217;or, through some of the most beautiful landscape I&#8217;ve seen. It&#8217;s a terrible shame, since to follow the same route of the Bras D&#8217;or is quite a challenge in a car. Roads don&#8217;t come event remotely close to some parts of the track. While a highway does follow the west bank of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, I doubt the view is the same.<br />
The abandonment is not yet certain, but is expected. This has left the Bras D&#8217;or&#8217;s crew with a lot of questions. They work together extremely well, and would want to continue the trend next year. However, there&#8217;s no way to know if the train will even run next spring. So until official word comes, they must wait.<br />
The residents of this area are also saddened with the news. It&#8217;s the only place where I&#8217;ve seen signs that read: &#8220;Welcome VIA&#8221;, sitting on the side of the railway. An elderly man in North Sydney even came to see the train pass, holding a sign that said: &#8220;Best Wishes VIA. We will miss you!&#8221;<br />
As we passed Sydney Mines, it was time for me to leave the cab. We didn&#8217;t want the other rail fan to see me leave the engine in Sydney. I didn&#8217;t quite make it back into the coach cars, though. I ended up spending some time in the near-empty baggage car talking with the VIA staff as they took a final break before arriving at the station.<br />
I could have walked to my hotel. But I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure where it was, nor was I too keen on carrying my bags that far right away. I opted for the five dollar, four minute cab ride. But I was checked into my room and sitting in the bed a scant 10 minutes after detraining. A record since I started riding trains a month ago.<br />
Sydney is an industrial town. In other words, there&#8217;s not much in it for nightlife. (Even the Bras D&#8217;or crew admitted to that.) But I wasn&#8217;t really interested in doing much anyway. All I wanted were a few pictures, a good meal, and a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
A fairly lengthy hike brought me down to the harbour area. That&#8217;s where Sydney has a fairly extensive boardwalk along the edge of the harbour, running for about a kilometre or so. A pretty good location for getting pictures of the city at dusk. A little further down were more hotels, the Royal Cape Breton Yacht Club, and an office building or two. I stopped into the Crow and Moose in the Delta Hotel for what were supposed to be the best fish and chips in the area. I couldn&#8217;t complain.<br />
Sydney has one of only two casinos in Nova Scotia. You&#8217;d think it would be clearly marked on signs and easy to find. I looked briefly, then decided that it wasn&#8217;t worth my time. My lucky streaks seem to tend towards life experiences, not money. Knowing my luck, I&#8217;d probably lose my shirt the moment I entered the door.<br />
Returning to the hotel, I curled up for a good night&#8217;s sleep. It would be another early morning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sleeping in is one of those little pleasures of life that I&#8217;ve been ignoring for far too long. The fact that I was still exhausted from yesterday made passing through my alarm even easier.<br />
I skipped breakfast. I was in serious need to finish my journal entries. My contract with CBC expired last night, and it was necessary for me to complete the deal. I wrote and edited until after noon, then disappeared to the bar downstairs to upload all the content. Finishing around 1:30, it was time to resume my tour of Halifax.<br />
Naturally, it was raining.<br />
Actually, I knew it would rain (the forecast had been heralding rain for days). I planned my tours to include Pier 21, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, and the Alexander Keith&#8217;s Brewery tour. All indoors &#8230; except for the distances in between.<br />
Pier 21 sits between the Halifax railway station and the harbour. (Back in the day, they were connected by track so the Intercolonial Railway could whisk away newcomers to distant corners of Canada.) A short taxi ride kept me relatively dry.<br />
Pier 21 was one of the many immigration entry points into Canada. It serviced incoming passenger ships that crossed the Atlantic from 1920 until 1971, when its last landed immigrant passed through its doors. In 1999, with grants and assistance from companies and donations, it reopened as a museum to those who worked at the facility, and all those who passed through its doors.<br />
The museum is sparsely furnished and yet conveys the confusion, process, and lives that existed within the walls. Exhibits tell stories from those who worked or passed through Pier 21, offer artefacts that illustrate the periods of time, and let visitors experience the caged feelings new arrivals must have felt.<br />
Perhaps the single best story is that told in &#8220;Oceans of Hope&#8221;. It&#8217;s a &#8220;four dimensional&#8221; multimedia presentation that incorporates slides, movies, audio, and a series of translucent screens that create a multi-dimensional view. The presentation of the medium is one thing, but the story it tells is something else.<br />
Just shy of one million people passed through Pier 21, all receiving the much-desired &#8220;Landed Immigrant&#8221; stamp. It is impossible to tell all those stories, so those presented are conglomerations of them. The original immigrants, the soldiers who passed through during WWII, the war brides and their children, the Jewish orphans, all linked by the narrator, a fictional immigration officer.<br />
The story is moving. And the projection method makes the people seem not only real, but also like ghosts. It seems as if the walls are telling the stories that it has seen for over three-quarters of a century. The presentation, in concert with the rest of the museum, makes you feel a little different about being Canadian. Not necessarily proud, but privileged. As a Canadian writer (and immigrant) wrote: &#8220;A Canadian is an immigrant with seniority.&#8221;<br />
One of the more interesting exhibits is the Canadian National Train. It&#8217;s a larger-than-reality mock-up of a passenger car, where you can experience a trip across Canada. In five minutes. The trip runs from Halifax to Vancouver &#8211; it&#8217;s a video filmed several years ago (the equipment you see are VIA Blue cars, not seen in transcontinental service for almost a decade, and it runs through Swift Current, which is CPR territory). Having just finished the trip myself, in the opposite direction, it&#8217;s an interesting perspective.<br />
I took another taxi to the Maritime Museum. The rain would have soaked me to the bone, and I was without umbrella. As it stands, I was better off taking the taxi regardless &#8211; I arrived with five minutes to spare before the Titanic 3-D movie, and the extra time allowed me extra time to look around.<br />
The movie was filmed at the same time as the IMAX&#8217; Titanica, but using different equipment and crews. The film doesn&#8217;t tell any stories &#8211; it is a 20-minute view of the wreck unlike any I&#8217;ve ever seen before. The ability to actually look inside the ship as if I were actually there is both wonderful and horrific.<br />
Exiting from the film, I wandered around the wind-powered portion. The musty wooden smell was overwhelming at times, but reminded me of my sailing days. Then it was through the extensive Titanic exhibit, and the wrecks of the Atlantic. There have been a lot of ships lost on and around the shores of Nova Scotia.<br />
So many that I lost track of time. I ended up having to rush my tour of the rest of the museum.<br />
I half-jogged down to Brewery Market in the rain, which hadn&#8217;t relented one bit. Slightly dampened, I entered through the North Arch, the original portal through which delivery carts once parcelled kegs of beer to points around Halifax. (There is a groove worn away in the base of the arch from the wheels.)<br />
I joined the tour in progress. The tour starts in the present, then works its way back to 1820, where it begins in Alexander Keith&#8217;s dining room. The room is gorgeous, and looks like it should be hosting lavish dinners, not a five-person tour group including three men from Georgia, one from Vancouver, and a latecomer from Calgary.<br />
Above the fireplace is a painting that is actually a plasma television screen. It shows a seven-odd minute film about Alexander Keith and how he started his brewery. You&#8217;d think something like this would be a wonderfully historical piece, considering the money they spent. (It&#8217;s a very nice-looking production.) Only problem &#8211; it reads like a beer commercial. Go figure.<br />
When the movie ends, the main character (the brewmaster) calls out for Mr. Keith to continue the tour. You almost expect someone in character as Mr. Keith to open the next door. It&#8217;s not Mr. Keith, but the assistant brewmaster, who immediately apologizes for Mr. Keith &#8211; a busy man who must attend to affairs of the city. (Alexander Keith was twice mayor of Halifax.)<br />
The tour leads through an office, and then into a small brew house (seen through windows from the courtyard). I think beer is still brewed here, but it isn&#8217;t the main brewery &#8211; there&#8217;s no way this small room can create the entire batch of Keith&#8217;s sold in Canada. It&#8217;s not terribly informative, either.<br />
After the brew room comes the barrelling room. We expected to see the cellar, a malting room, all the things you&#8217;d expect when on a tour of a brewery. But instead, we ended up in the restored Stag&#8217;s Head &#8211; the basement of Keith&#8217;s original house, and the pub he used to operate. It was sampling time.<br />
I felt kind of bad for all the actors employed. They tried very hard to make the experience interesting. But with only five people in the tour, it was extremely quiet. With such a small crew, I would have liked them to drop the act, but I guess that&#8217;s part of their job. They did it well, though. I suspect with a larger group, the tour would be much better.<br />
It was still pouring outside. I had no particular place to go next, and touring downtown in the rain was not a particularly wise idea. I took shelter in the Four Points Sheraton before snagging a cab back to my hotel.<br />
I called to see if Chris, Amy, or Roger were around. None answered. (I knew they were all still in town.) Figuring I&#8217;d arrived back too late, and they&#8217;d gone to dinner, I called back leaving messages wishing them a safe trip back to Toronto, hoping our paths would cross again. When I called Roger to leave the message, he answered.<br />
Roger had been out playing golf with clients. In the driving rain. He&#8217;d been thoroughly soaked, despite wearing foul weather gear. But he&#8217;d still had a good day. Apparently, Amy and Chris were still out touring around &#8211; we would get together for dinner when they got back.<br />
Amy and Chris had been out in the Bay of Fundy, going as far as Kentville. Returning, they&#8217;d laid down for a little while before the four of us went out for Italian. Amy found Il Mercato in her Frommer&#8217;s guide &#8230; but it was the same one Daryl had recommended earlier.<br />
We ate, discussed our futures (collective and individual), and enjoyed the company. Eating our fill, we returned to the hotel. I said my goodbyes &#8211; I was leaving on the Bras D&#8217;or early the next morning, and would not see the three of them off.<br />
But I would get another chance.<br />
As I sat in the hotel&#8217;s bar, using their Internet connection, I heard a familiar voice exclaim: &#8220;Geoff!&#8221;  I looked up to see Tracy and her cousin. I had thought Chris, Amy, and I the last ones in the hotel (Roger had moved to the Westin for business). Both Tracy and Marc had extended their stay to visit their respective families.<br />
I would join Tracy and her cousin on the way back to Marc&#8217;s room. Marc&#8217;s friend was also there. Roger would arrive shortly thereafter, followed by Amy and Chris. It felt like the last party. I did not stay too long. I had an early morning.<br />
As I walked down the hall back to the elevators and to my room, the sounds of the small get together died out. The hallways became deathly quiet. Everyone was gone. We were the last.</p>

Day 30<br />
This is an entry I dreaded writing from the beginning. It&#8217;s the last one. It&#8217;s the last day. Today, people begin their trips home. Some are staying around for a little tourism, but they are few.<br />
I joined up with Duffy, Gerry, the Bills, the Robs, and Trish for a little excursion to the Bay of Fundy. Loading up into the crew&#8217;s two rented minivans, we took off out of the city for parts unknown. Gerry drove the first van, Trish navigating. Duffy followed in the second van.<br />
I sat next to Bill C. and behind Rob N. Bill, the crossword king, scribbled on his newspaper for most of the trip out. Our van was quiet, unlike Gerry&#8217;s. But it gave me time to think about how lucky I was. A small handful of people were given the chance to make this trip. Sure, it was hard and at times very frustrating, but in the end it was all worth it. This is an experience that I cannot imagine having passed up.<br />

Day 29<br />
Early morning call. The last one. Breakfast, grab things for the day, taxi to the station, and begin final set-up. New Media didn&#8217;t change from the day before, but others were moving around in the station to better locations. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t too much work, and fairly expeditiously handled. When the CBC Halifax staff event began (it was our first of the day), we were all ready.<br />
So began a day that, at least for me, was little more than a blurry dream. It was pockmarked with little things, like each of us getting our chance at Be An Anchor, or exchanging addresses. The production was slowly running out of steam. One more event would have been too much.<br />

Day 28<br />
A maternity ward of babies didn&#8217;t sleep as well as I did last night. I stirred only once, when the cleaning staff tried to come in the room. I woke late, but feeling more awake and alert than I have since this trip started.<br />
We arrived at the Halifax station to find it a hive of activity. It seemed that there would almost be no room for us to set up. Tonight was a VIP event, signifying the end of our odyssey.<br />
It was our last time unloading the train. But despite the finality, we had no lack of drive. The train was dutifully unpacked, and items drawn into the station. The fit was a little tight with some items, such as the centre triangle for New Media and &#8220;The Beast&#8221; from the Boutique.<br />
During set-up, I had yet another partial run-in with fame. Julie pulled me aside to tell me of a woman who had been following our journey through my daily journal. What blew me away was that she&#8217;d tried to catch up with us in Melville. Over half the country away. She had flown from Indian Head, Saskatchewan to see us here in Halifax. Both Julie and I were beside ourselves.<br />
By 2:00, everything was almost ready. That&#8217;s when we were told of touch-ups. This is our second-to-last event. We&#8217;ve spent 27 days on the road, and our equipment isn&#8217;t exactly looking new. (The fact that it looks good at all is amazing.) For our final events, the tables received a new coat of paint.<br />
We literally ended up watching paint dry. The Halifax station is quite active &#8212; VIA&#8217;s Ocean train departs and arrives every day. Busses are also a constant source of traffic. The last thing you want is for things to go missing. We don&#8217;t expect theft, we just don&#8217;t want to encourage it.<br />
One of our group activities was a group photograph. We&#8217;ve taken two already, one in Jasper and another in Winnipeg. We now have our final crew, and it should be immortalized. However, due to some rather odd scheduling, not everyone was around when we got to taking the picture. We&#8217;ll shoot another picture tomorrow, but we&#8217;ll already be short one person.<br />
Today, Angela left us for home. She is the first of the original crew arriving in Halifax to leave. It was a sad occasion, though for most people it will only be a short time until they see her in Toronto. I will be lucky if I see Angela again. On Sunday, many others will take their leave. Today was but a hint of what is to come.<br />
The VIPs started arriving just after 5:00. For the next four hours, we wandered about, handing out giveaways, and trying to be helpful. It&#8217;s not our favourite kind of event. It requires a lot of work, and doesn&#8217;t produce benefit. Most of the visitors are here to see other visitors, not us. We&#8217;re window dressing. We&#8217;d rather add extra hours onto the public events.<br />
Barely a month ago (see [[CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Opening Event Pacific Central Station|5 September 2002]]), I thought VIP events were pretty neat. I guess it doesn&#8217;t take long to get jaded.<br />
Speeches were a key focus. It gave time for CBC to bring up the Executive Vice-President, Harold Redekopp for a chance to talk about what the 50th Anniversary meant, and what part the train played. I personally preferred the speech by the Honourable Myra Freeman, the Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia.<br />
The single best speech was a rant by Rick Mercer, shown on video (Rick himself was present). It echoed another shorter rant he had done for the 50th anniversary, but with a more political slant. It was extremely funny, especially when he illustrated just how Canadians view the CBC. I would repeat examples, but they would likely be edited for content.<br />
Back in the hotel following the event, I would see Rick again on &#8220;Tuning In&#8221;, one of the 50th anniversary shows. I caught the very end of the show, and saw little. But what I did see were the credits. For the first time, I knew the names that went by on the screen. I didn&#8217;t just know who they were, I had worked with them. They were friends and comrades. The credits had meaning.<br />
After a month on the road with the CBC, I now understand the appeal of working in television.</p>

Day 27<br />
The trip portion of this journey is officially over. The train rolled into Halifax early this morning while we slept. We awoke slowly, and moved sluggishly. While many are looking forward to going home, most of us are sad that we&#8217;ve come to the end of the line. Appropriately, it was raining.<br />
Packing up our train lives was no easy task. We&#8217;ve accumulated a surprising amount of stuff over the last month &#8212; bags were literally bursting. We had about two and a half hours to clean our stuff out, which seemed ample enough to find everything. I wandered about the train a bit, sometimes tripping over others in the midst of finding all their clothes.<br />
It almost felt like I was moving out of a favourite apartment and moving away from old friends. There was a certain sombre sadness of leaving the train after being on it for so long. We&#8217;ll only be using the train in coming days as a place to take meals. From here on, we&#8217;ll be staying in a hotel. We&#8217;re done riding trains. Not counting public transit, I don&#8217;t figure on taking a train until next year.<br />
The time came, and VIA came around with a tractor to collect our bags. They&#8217;d arrive with the vans at the hotel later on. We gathered in the station in anticipation of our shuttles. Roger and Trish vanished to rent a car, as did Duffy and Gerry. While waiting, one of the VIA crew from our train (I think his name is Carl) handed me an envelope. He told me not to tell anyone, and not to open it until I got to the hotel.<br />
We loaded our shuttle bus for our last hotel, a bare block from the CBC Halifax office. The driver lost me in the maze of turns. And I don&#8217;t get lost easily. The hotel is a fair distance from downtown, but it&#8217;s actually not too bad. We can feasibly walk the distance. The hotel is quite large, which is nice. It even has a small lounge. Something I&#8217;m sure the crew will make repeated use of.<br />
We were unable to check into our rooms right away. Some managed to get rooms, but the majority of us stuffed our baggage into an unused conference room. Some simply crashed and relaxed for the afternoon. Some of us were more interested in adventure.<br />
Roger, Trish, Amy, Stefani, Analisa, and myself piled into Roger&#8217;s rented Lincoln Navigator (upgraded thanks to several nearly-expired upgrade coupons) and bolted for Peggy&#8217;s Cove. The Bills, the Robs, Gerry, Duffy, Emma, and Lisa followed in two minivans. We arrived quite a bit ahead of them, no doubt in part to Roger&#8217;s ability to traverse distances in safe haste. Although we took the &#8220;long&#8221; route, we arrived in under 45 minutes.<br />
It&#8217;s been about 22 years since I last set foot in Nova Scotia. Yet I remembered the area as we approached Peggy&#8217;s Cove. I wondered if I would, considering how young I had been at the time. As we exited the forest for the coastal spaces, I started to recognize a few things. Then a faint memory came to me &#8230; one I hadn&#8217;t thought of in years. A little over two decades ago, I got carsick into one of the many little bays. I dreaded a repeat show &#8212; my sister would never let me live it down.<br />
Peggy&#8217;s Cove was, unsurprisingly, crowded with tourists. The streets were full of them, making driving a little treacherous. We finally arrived at the parking lot at the edge of the coast, next to the famous Peggy&#8217;s Cove Lighthouse and Post Office. It&#8217;s something to have postcards with a Peggy&#8217;s Cove cancellation.<br />
Exiting from our safe, warm vehicle, we found the he wind was biting. Perhaps not as bad as the previous night&#8217;s mosquitoes, but it was still breath taking. Especially when, like myself, you&#8217;re wearing shorts. (Actually, I wasn&#8217;t that cold, but hopping from a warm car to the chilly air was pause for thought. Amy and I were a little cool, but didn&#8217;t suffer as much as Roger, Stefani, and Trish. Analisa played it smart and stayed in the gift shop most of the time we were there.)<br />
We hopped over the rocks like mountain goats. Some hid behind them periodically, due to the cold. I marvelled at the water-rounded rocks, the cracks, the seaweed, the sky, the waves, and the undeniable smell of fresh saltwater. A month ago, I marvelled at a similar scene on the west coast. This was simultaneously similar, yet completely different. (And despite that the two massive oceans are connected, the Atlantic has a decidedly different smell than the Pacific. I&#8217;d love to know why.)<br />
The two other vans appeared about 20 minutes after we arrived. Soon the rocks were swarming with CBC train staff. We would congregate in small groups, filter out across the rolling waves of stone, and regroup in other places. At a distance, we probably looked no different than seagulls as they ride the ocean.<br />
We left about an hour after arriving. The goal was also to see Lunenburg during our tour of the province. As we left town, we started to look for the Flight 111 Memorial. On the night of 2 September 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Peggy&#8217;s Cove. All 229 passengers and crew were lost. The tragedy put the small town of Peggy&#8217;s Cove on the world map for a time, and has left a mark ever since. Only a few short kilometres away, visible from Peggy&#8217;s Cove, is a simple memorial to those who lost their lives, and those who were first on the scene: the fishers of Peggy&#8217;s Cove.<br />
You can&#8217;t see the memorial from the road. It requires a bit of a walk down a gravel path until you reach a stone platform upon which are two stone discs, mounted perpendicular to the platform, at an angle to each other. One side of the discs is rounded, the inside flat. The inside faces out to the ocean, the surfaces engraved. One of the discs has three notches out of the top &#8212; 111. Supposedly, the notches look towards where the plane went down. You can&#8217;t see it from shore. The crash site is just over the horizon. Over three years have passed since the tragic events, but flowers still arrive here.<br />
The two vans did finally arrive in Lunenburg &#8212; we did not. Although we had been headed in that direction, we hadn&#8217;t gone out to the highway (the fastest method), and were in no real hurry. In fact, we were sidetracked by an overwhelming need to eat. Luckily for us, you often find the best meals when you&#8217;re on the verge of getting totally lost.<br />
Lost was exactly was I was beginning to feel like. With Trish navigating, Roger was bombing up and down hills in search of &#8230; well, probably not really in search of anything. That&#8217;s half the fun of exploring &#8212; knowing you really don&#8217;t need to find anything. That&#8217;s how we ended up in the middle of nowhere (actually, it was somewhere around Upper Tantallon, wherever that is). We stopped at a general store, where we got directions to the nearest good restaurant. Luckily, it was just around the next bend.<br />
The Pilot House Cafe is definitely off the beaten path. So far off, in fact, that it was empty save for the sole waitress. The inside was cottagey, looking (somewhat) recently renovated. Apparently, the cafe is primarily for the lodgers of the adjoining cabins. When the tourist flow is slow, rogue travellers are eagerly welcomed. The first question was &#8220;who wants chowder?&#8221;.<br />
The chef, Billy, knows his food. Seafood chowder so thick you could spackle a house (and came in the most darling bowls); calamari so fresh, soft, and tangy as to almost pierce the soul; and if you&#8217;d told me that you could put scallops on a pizza, I&#8217;d have called you crazy. The taste is otherworldly. I won&#8217;t mention dessert. Trust me, you&#8217;ll only drool over your keyboard, and that just doesn&#8217;t look attractive.<br />
Packed to the rim, we rolled out of the restaurant and found our way back to Halifax. The trip took barely 20 minutes &#8212; we took the highway. We didn&#8217;t make a beeline back to the hotel, though. Tonight was our last (planned) full team dinner, at a restaurant called Soho Kitchen downtown. Analisa wanted to acquire a new pair of shoes for the event. This led to almost everyone thinking they could use something. Everyone except me. My bag are already too full &#8212; I simply can&#8217;t pack anything else in. If I buy any souvenirs in this city, it&#8217;s going to have to be small.<br />
We sidled into one of the local malls, and we ducked into a Sears Outlet store. I hadn&#8217;t been in an outlet store for a while. I remembered why. Nothing to be found in sight. At least for Roger and I. Amy, Trish, and Analisa hunted around. Stefani didn&#8217;t seem all that enthralled, admittedly. Finding the store a bit of a washout, we returned to the car and pulled around front to the rest of the mall complex. This time, I stayed in the car. I was tired from all the activity (and the food). I slept for a few minutes while the others shopped.<br />
We were a little slow recongregating. Roger and Trish were back early. Stefani was maybe a minute or two late. Analisa took considerably longer. But we could not find Amy. She&#8217;d vanished. We patrolled the mall, at first with our eyes, and then with the car. No sign of her anywhere. We checked the stores she&#8217;d said she was going to check. Nothing. We were getting a little worried. We thought that perhaps we had somehow managed to miss each other, and Amy had taken a cab back to the hotel. As we were making our last pass to make sure we hadn&#8217;t missed something, Amy walked out of the mall&#8217;s entrance. Relieved that we&#8217;d found her, we returned to the hotel. Tonight was our wrap party.<br />
In theatre, you&#8217;d normally wait until the end of the production to hold the festivities. Our last show is Saturday, 5 October. But starting tomorrow, we start losing our staff. Lives need to be lived, and almost all of us have taken a month&#8217;s leave of absence from them. With our time together rapidly closing, it&#8217;s our last chance for a full team dinner.<br />
We went to Soho Kitchen, on a recommendation from Daryl, a former and still-periodic Halifax resident. It&#8217;s a more local haunt, and definitely not a tourist trap. Crammed into a side room that barely fit us all, we outnumbered the remaining patrons. We easily overpowered them with volume. The menu items were so tantalising that it was extremely difficult to choose. Lisa took it upon herself to choose for me (I didn&#8217;t offer a lot of resistance). Thai scallops. Quite tasty.<br />
Speeches that weren&#8217;t meant to be speeches followed dinner. Neil wanted to thank a few people who had made the trip happen, and memorable. Unfortunately, he went down the slippery slope of inclusion, and found himself having to thank everyone. It&#8217;s a dicey problem any of us could have walked into. If you don&#8217;t make just the right speech, you run the risk of offending someone &#8212; either by understating something they think was more important, or perhaps forgetting them all together. Still, I have to give Neil credit for at least trying to say something about everyone. No-one else had tried by that point, and I doubt ever will. It was a more emotional event than I think any of us really realized.<br />
Following our repast, we adjourned to the Seahorse Pub, a local legend since 1948. The interior was &#8230; in transition. Renovations in the corner seemed to indicate that the bar had some work planned. It was almost impossible to tell when the last time the renovations had even been touched.<br />
We toasted our success, and the people who would soon leave. Emma convinced me to join her in a game of darts. That was her first mistake. She suggested a game called &#8220;cricket&#8221;. That was her second mistake. I must laud Emma&#8217;s patience as she repeatedly taught me the rules, which seemed so complicated at the time. (In all honestly, speaking becomes complicated after enough pints of beer.) We never finished the game &#8212; neither of us could hit the bullseye after a while &#8212; but I still lost.<br />
It was then back to the hotel. I don&#8217;t really remember the walk back, other than I felt a draining urge to get to my room as quickly as possible. We don&#8217;t have an early morning tomorrow, but sleep is still a wonderful thing.<br />
Oh, what was in the envelope you ask? Hmm&#8230; I forgot to mention that, didn&#8217;t I? Well, Carl and I had talked a bit on the train on our way from Montreal. He, like the other regional managers for VIA, could spot a railfan around the next corner. He could also tell that I was far from worn out from our little jaunt across the country. He had asked if I would be interested in riding the Bras D&#8217;or, VIA&#8217;s rail cruise from Halifax to Sydney, on Cape Breton island. I had replied at the time that I would love to go, but simply couldn&#8217;t afford it. Carl said he would see what he could do. In the envelope was a round-trip pass on the Bras D&#8217;or.<br />
Who said there&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch?</p>

Day 26<br />
There was apparently a bit of activity last night. Early in the morning, Julie came up to me and asked if I&#8217;d heard anything during the night. Aside from the train itself, I heard little. Julie seemed &#8230; undecided, and then walked away. That, my friends, is a mystery just screaming to be solved. I had to know what happened last night. I checked with Emma, my guaranteed source for information. She didn&#8217;t know. The both of us were now insatiably curious. The investigation would continue most of the day.<br />
One of the things we were told early on, long before we left Vancouver, was that we were never, ever to drink on board. This was explained away as insurance reasons. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the truth or the story, but the fact was that we were not to drink. Officially, the rule was followed. Unofficially, we broke every single rule we were given within the first two days of the trip. Both VIA and the CBC turned a blind eye to almost everything. At least until last night.<br />
While breaking the rule (for the umpteenth time) of not staying in the baggage car while the train is in motion, several people (whose names I shall not divulge) indulged in another forbidden activity: alcoholic consumption. All of this was known, common, and though not accepted, tolerated. However, being the second-to-last night on the train, a couple of people got &#8230; happy. And perhaps a little sloppy. One of them, staying in a room in my Chateau car, accidentally went into Julie&#8217;s room, which was on the following Chateau car. I can&#8217;t really imagine what took place at that exact moment. When I finally heard the story, I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing.<br />
Today was almost a repeat of yesterday, just with a shorter event. And a different city. And different event layout. And different performers. And no rain, with lots of wind. And it was hot. Okay, today has no semblance to yesterday, except the province, arrive, set-up, event, tear-down, pack-up, and leave.<br />
Today was Moncton. Most of us had never been here before (like any of us had been to Campbellton &#8212; except Marc).<br />
We had no Internet access. Quel surprise. A little miffed since I could see a huge NBTel tower about a kilometre away. I can only assume that either NBTel doesn&#8217;t have a 1x network, or doesn&#8217;t have a deal with Bell Canada to rebroadcast users onto Bell&#8217;s network. It didn&#8217;t change the fact that I had to find an Internet Cafe. I wandered east through town on directions from local VIA staff. Up and down streets I went, but no Internet to be found. Not even a hint of Internet. For all I could tell, Moncton was digitally isolated from the rest of the world. The only thing I found of note were three churches sitting kiddie-corner to each other, at the corner of Church and Queen: United, United Baptist, and Anglican. Connectivity, yes, but with the wrong deity.<br />
Deprived of Internet, I returned to the train to begin our set-up. The weather was windy, but promised little chance of rain. We went for the entire New Media configuration. Some of the other tents skipped some of their items: Sports dropped the cut-outs, and the Boutique opted not to use &#8220;The Beast&#8221;. All the tents were heavily staked down, and remaining signage weighted down with sandbags and tied up. Our loose items (such as the bookmarks) had to sit carefully on the tables so a strong gust wouldn&#8217;t blow them off into oblivion. Sports, at least, had a small mountain of fridge magnets to hold their pages in place.<br />
Although we didn&#8217;t officially open until 15:00, people were already arriving by 14:30. Early arrivals weren&#8217;t a problem &#8212; we were all ready to go live with the show. Our friend Murphy, mostly silent throughout the trip, decided we&#8217;d become too smug in our preparations. That&#8217;s probably why the power went out at 14:58. Apparently the entire neighbourhood lost power, not just us. Most of the tents, half of the VIA station, most of the mobile, and the entire train went without power. At first I was confused, since we normally run off our generator, and our cars off the locomotive&#8217;s HEP generator. It would figure that the first time we run everything off shore power that there&#8217;s a blackout.<br />
Somehow, the New Media tent &#8212; the one with the largest power requirements of any tent &#8212; was unaffected. News, Sports, half of the mobile, the museum, and half the train station were completely in the dark. Within twenty minutes, the engine was switched to HEP, and power ran back through the train. The museum came back to life, and visitors finally started to walk through. News and Sports would be without power until much later in the afternoon, when the power company finally fixed the problem.<br />
The lack of electricity didn&#8217;t dampen any spirits, however. Visitors created a near two-hour line to see the museum. Every tent had a swarm of visitors. Koceila and I were on our toes most of the time. Koceila talked mostly about the Archives site &#8212; I talked to people who have been reading my journals online. It&#8217;s still really bizarre being a virtual pseudo-celebrity. I&#8217;m truly amazed at the number of people who read these things. I&#8217;d always thought it would be kind of neat to do. That people would not only read it, but try and find me was something I honestly hadn&#8217;t expected.<br />
Later in the afternoon, we had to temporarily close the museum. This time, it wasn&#8217;t due to errant electricity. It was due to the scheduled arrival of VIA&#8217;s Ocean train. The Ocean runs from Halifax to Montreal, and is the oldest scheduled train in Canada. It will have run for 100 years of service in 2004 &#8212; a trip I might have to make for myself. As it is scheduled (runs every day except Tuesday), we had to temporarily shut down for about 40 minutes while the Ocean did its thing. Then it was off to Montreal, and we got back to entertaining.<br />
Speaking of entertaining, there were a few live acts floating around. But not on a stage outside. Due to problems with the site layout and the potential weather, the stage was inside. That&#8217;s where you could find Anthony McLean, a couple of bands, and the Moncton Ballet. Yes, the ballet. Believe me, we scratched our heads at that one, too. They were good, even crammed into the wee spaces of the station.<br />
About a half hour before we began tear-down, I had a woman approach me. I haven&#8217;t seen a smile that large since we&#8217;d started. Her first words were &#8220;thank you for coming&#8221;. She then detailed almost everything in our museum, and how wonderful it was to see it all. &#8220;You should be proud of the work you&#8217;ve all done here. The team must be so amazing to make this all work. You should congratulate yourselves on a job well done!&#8221; Just as calmly as she appeared, she vanished into the crowd.<br />
It&#8217;s people like her that kept us going after our longest, hardest days. They&#8217;re the people we want to reach out to. Not because we want the congratulations, but because they&#8217;ve supported the CBC over the years. Public company or not, without loyal viewers (and listeners), the CBC would not exist.<br />
As the sun went down, we started to strike our sets. For the tents, it would be the last time &#8212; we won&#8217;t be using them in Halifax. Things went back in boxes, tables were collapsed, monitors packed away, and things carted back to the train. When it finally got dark, we noticed something. Mosquitoes. The last time we&#8217;d seen insects was Melville. We&#8217;d had to close early due to marauding hoardes of the bloodsuckers. There weren&#8217;t as many in Moncton. Probably because the air traffic controllers had to line the beasts up in order to get near us. And unlike their Melvillian cousins, these little buggers actually hurt!<br />
Our strike was faster than previous ones, probably the fastest we&#8217;ll ever do. Whether or not it was due to experience, or due to the overwhelming flood of giant mutant mosquitoes is up for debate. Either way, our second-to-last pack job was done in record time, which was fine for us &#8212; the faster we could lock the doors, the less painful the bites would be.<br />
On [[CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Opening Event Pacific Central Station|5 September]], we had our first full-scale strike of our sets. It took us over three and a half hours. We joked that we would have it down to an hour and a half when we got to Halifax. We broke the time tonight, our last item loaded into the baggage cars barely an hour and a half after starting. It was reason to celebrate.<br />
But it&#8217;s a bittersweet celebration. Our time together is rapidly ending. Tonight will be our last on the train. As I write this, we are rolling steadily closer to Halifax. Tomorrow we leave our home of the last month for the last time. We take with us the strange stories that can only be created when living in the conditions as those on our train. We will miss it dearly.<br />
I spent some time in the Banff Park&#8217;s dome, watching the train weave its way through the canyon of trees. The only light came from the lead locomotive&#8217;s headlamps, and from the odd light buried in the forests. I will only be hearing the mournful blats of the horn for a little while longer. I&#8217;m still debating on whether I want to go to sleep tonight.<br />
On [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Vancouver|7 September]], I said I would have a difficult time leaving this train. I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

Day 25<br />
No-one slept well last night. It was too hot, too bouncy, too loud. I think it was also because the last night we slept on the train was 18 September. Since then, we&#8217;ve slept in large beds in hotels, or at home. Our first night on the train was exciting, so we didn&#8217;t notice the change. After over a week in controlled conditions, the erratic environment of the train is a little unsettling. Today, we get back into the groove we had when we started almost a month ago.<br />
Today is what used to be a typical day for us: arrive in the early morning (usually in the wee hours), set up the displays, entertain and inform the local populous, pack up, leave late in the evening. We&#8217;re all looking forward to the regularity for the next couple of days. Most of us seem to like this pattern. We&#8217;ve officially become the Cirque du CBC.<br />
I awoke to an announcement suggesting we eat breakfast and get ready to unload the train. For only the second time since the trip started, and the first on the train, I&#8217;d overslept. As I walked down the length of our Chateau cars, I could see the river, or the Gulf of St. Lawrence (a significant body of water, regardless). Admittedly, I&#8217;d never been to Campbellton before, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was, and I never did find out. [Ed. Note: It was neither. Campbellton sits on the south shore of the Restigouche River, west of the river mouth, south of the Gaspé Peninsula.]<br />
Gulping down breakfast in record time, I ran outside to catch up with the rest of the team already beginning to unpack the baggage car. Set-up was almost too easy. We&#8217;ve done these so many times that the problems are reduced to predicting the weather. (No wireless connection in Campbellton &#8212; no surprise, there &#8212; so we couldn&#8217;t check the online weather forecast.)Koceila had little trouble, learning the ropes extrememly fast. As usual, crowds were forming long before the doors were officially open. We&#8217;ve never turned people away, just so long as we can accommodate them. Our official start was 12:00, but we were entertaining long before then.<br />
Roger was running around with the Polaroid camera while everyone assembled their sets. I think Roger either got too much sleep last night, or has gone certifiably insane. Either way, his smile and laughter is becoming infectious. (Hmm&#8230; maybe we&#8217;re all going insane&#8230;) His jovial condition proved advantageous when a car drove right into the barricaded parking lot we were using for our show. Roger looked a little ticked at first. He went to talk to the driver, an elderly woman, and pointed the direction out of the lot. Then he took a picture of the passenger. He came over and told me, giggling the whole time, that the passenger was Hazel McCallion, the mayor of Mississauga, ON. Apparently, she was visiting her sister &#8212; the driver.<br />
As usually, we received our volunteers a few minutes into the game. Normally, we&#8217;re given students or local CBC employees. I can only assume that students of sufficient age were hard to come by. This time, we received two of the oldest and kindest ladies in Campbellton. Neither really knew how to use a computer. I stood there and laughed to myself at the idea, but I knew by this point that I really didn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s about servicing people, not computers. So long as they reached out to those who came around, we would be successful. And since these women knew almost everyone in town (it seemed), success came easily. (The volunteers would change partway through the afternoon, and we&#8217;d get late-teenaged volunteers.)<br />
The weather had been iffy from the moment we started &#8212; cold, damp, and threatening rain &#8212; but we risked a full New Media set-up. It was the small towns that we loved all through our trip. We were hoping Campbellton would be as much a success. I kept one eye on the sky at all times.<br />
Just after noon, we already had a large crowd. We were off to a strong start. We were feeling very positive about the event (the previous two hadn&#8217;t really done anything for our self esteem). Then came a sound that we hadn&#8217;t been expecting, and initially worried us tremendously. Protesters. A large group of them marched up the street, whistling, chanting, and waving signs. I think everyone in our group froze, wondering what kind of trouble we were going to get ourselves into. At first, we thought they were protesting something we had done, or that CBC didn&#8217;t resign Ron MacLean. (Hey, some hockey fans are that devoted.)<br />
It turned out to be the local CUPE union, striking due to a lack of a contract. Some of their signs showed slogans, while others wished CBC and Radio-Canada a happy 50th birthday. In both languages! (We can only assume they did that so they would be &#8220;accepted&#8221; at the event, rather than politely asked to leave. As they caused no trouble, we didn&#8217;t see a need to have them removed. They stayed for about an hour, mingling with the crowd, seeing our displays, cheering for whomever was on stage. Eventually, they gathered back together and returned to their march.<br />
Rain came again, as dreaded. There were the odd deluges, but nothing as serious as Montreal, and all fairly brief. Also, we were on a parking lot, so we didn&#8217;t have to worry about mud. Except for Children&#8217;s, that is &#8212; they were in the low part of the parking lot. Lake CBC formed under their tent after a while, and the tent ended up having to shut down (the Mural was moved inside the VIA station to remain available). The Boutique also had to close early due to rain falling on their spare supplies.<br />
Throughout the day, we had people of all ages, all walks of life, and speaking both languages, come out to see our displays. All of them, regardless of language, loved everything. Not a single disparaging word. Even the weather didn&#8217;t seem to stop anyone from coming out.<br />
One woman in particular was one of our volunteers, Irene. She was perhaps the single most energetic person I&#8217;ve seen since leaving Vancouver. Although as part of her volunteering she made an effort to promote us, I think there was a lot of self-interest. Even when Irene&#8217;s time helping out was over, she hung around. She saw the museum, even did a stint at Be An Anchor, where she entertained the crowd by adding on the first verse of &#8220;Are You Lonely Tonight (for Seniors)&#8221; &#8230; after a lot of goading from me and several of her friends.<br />
During a lull in the activities, I made an effort to wander around Campbellton. Having never been there before, and not having been particularly on the ball (Marc&#8217;s father is from Campbellton, so assumedly, Marc knows something), I didn&#8217;t really know what too look for. The only real thing I could find was the bridge linking Campbellton with the opposite shore of the river. That, and a small, rusty narrow-gauge railway whose lineage I couldn&#8217;t figure out. (It&#8217;s not in my Trackside Guide.) Things I need to remember to research when I get home&#8230;<br />
In other places, we&#8217;ve had little trouble closing down at the end of an event. Campbellton was just such an example, until Koceila and I started turning off computers. First, all our volunteers suddenly vanished, leaving Koceila and I to tackle it alone. Also, Koceila can&#8217;t see well in the dark. And having a the local CBC station doing a broadcast next to our tent introduced issues of ownership. I think we lost a powerbar or two tonight.<br />
Even with our difficulties, we were headed for a new record for packing the train. Although the Boutique was already well away, packing up in less than two hours was still something to celebrate. Then the most stunning show of the Northern Lights sidetracked us. (The technical crew says that the lights in Biggar were better.) We stopped our heaving and shoving, and for the next half hour watched the celestial curtains flow back and forth across the sky. I know how the Northern Lights are formed, but that doesn&#8217;t take away one speck of wonder while watching them.<br />
Our train was to leave at 22:30. That left us over an hour to visit Dooley&#8217;s next door. (Literally next door &#8212; the rear entrance of the bar comes out onto the station platform.) We talked about the fun we&#8217;ve had, the show&#8217;s we&#8217;ve done, and the people we&#8217;ve met. We didn&#8217;t talk about the three remaining shows. A lot of us want the shows to be over, but a few of us don&#8217;t want this to end. This train is about to reach the light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
Three of the VIA staff were in Dooley&#8217;s with us, assumedly against rules. (I get the feeling the Service Manager didn&#8217;t know they were in the bar.) They signalled us a few minutes before 22:30, and suggested we settle the tab and get back on board. There were a few people who seemed to think we weren&#8217;t leaving on time. The train left at 10:30, as planned.<br />
After weeks of negotiation and agreements, Daryl finally got the change to climb into the cab of #6403 to film our progress as we headed east. The whole process has been ridiculous, bordering on insanity. Daryl&#8217;s filmed in the cockpits of fighter jets while in flight &#8212; something far more dangerous that sitting in the cab of a locomotive. But VIA has their rules. It wasn&#8217;t until Montreal that wheels really started turning, apparently. Only now did things finally pay off. We climbed into the Skyline dome to watch &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; on DVD. Several of the others climbed into their rooms, roomettes, and berths to sleep.<br />
When I finally turned in, I rolled up my window blind to watch the passing vista. Like when we left Vancouver, it was pitch dark outside. But the sky was on fire &#8212; the Northern Lights made the heavens look like they were being ripped apart. The waves of light undulated rapidly, weaving in and out of each other, appearing suddenly and disappearing just as fast.<br />
I fell asleep watching the celestial ballet.</p>

Day 24<br />
Today is a travel day, but we didn&#8217;t leave Quebec City until almost 18:30. That gave us plenty of time to do the things we wanted to do, and hadn&#8217;t done the day before. For me, that was sleep in &#8212; the previous day had worn me out.<br />
I was behind on my journals. Partly because I&#8217;d wanted to get away from a computer for a day, and also because I get easily distracted. (Trains, interesting cities, and shiny metal objects will do that.) After breakfast and helping Ivan with his email, I sat down for a few hours of solid typing and image manipulation.<br />
It&#8217;s just dawned on me that you might not really know how I write a typical journal entry. It usually starts with a pivot event or two that happened during the day. If there was nothing particularly outstanding, then it&#8217;s a theme. If I&#8217;m really running short of something to focus on, then I&#8217;ll just tell the tale of the day. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to punctuate it along the way with something interesting or humourous. I do like to set context, which is why you&#8217;ll often see historical content thrown in. Having taken pictures, I also have a visual record of what we&#8217;ve done, just in case that dusty expanse known as my memory doesn&#8217;t quite fit the bill.<br />
Now that just covers half the problem &#8212; the text. (Well, not entirely. I also have to edit it, because things like this probably won&#8217;t make it into the official record.) I still have pictures to prepare. The easy part is actually preparing them &#8212; the hard part is selecting them. I take a lot of pictures &#8212; I&#8217;ve taken about 2,000 pictures already, and I&#8217;m far from stopping this trip. I&#8217;ve still got a long way to go. Once I&#8217;ve picked about a half dozen pictures, I run them through Photoshop, which has a couple of macros I built for myself. These resize the images automatically. Then all I have to do is connect to the Internet, and away everything goes to Toronto. Normally, it&#8217;s over the wireless system, but when the wireless doesn&#8217;t work, I use the hotel&#8217;s connection. In Quebec City, at least, I need only plug in the antenna.<br />
Finishing up, I checked out of my room and put my bags in a holding room. I had no idea what I was going to do next &#8212; I I hadn&#8217;t really planned for anything else. I ran into Analisa and, Lisa in the lobby, who were going to Café Suisse, the restaurant we&#8217;d left early from last night. Not in the mood for a fondue, I wanted something else. As odd as it might sound, I wanted French onion soup. I had yet to find a restaurant that served it (which I found strange, in a stereotypical sort of way). Analisa wasn&#8217;t about to let me down, though, and asked the taxi driver &#8230; in French. Analisa was determined to practice speaking French. The driver suggested I try the Café de la Paix.<br />
I had passed the place the day before and had paid it no mind. A small, basement-level restaurant with an unassuming sign, it was easy to see how the average person could walk by. I started going over French in my mind, and tried to figure out what I was going to say. This made me a little sad, actually &#8212; 17 years ago, I had caught myself actually thinking in French while walking through Basse-Ville. Now I had to make a concerted effort to translate my intentions into passable French. I took my seat and examined the menu. Then it was time to make an order. The staff seemed more than willing to humour my poorer-than-highschool French. Soupe l&#8217;onion gratinee (the waiter had to check to make sure the soup was even available) et salade cesar, avec une biere Blanche de Chambly.<br />
The soup was outstanding. Not too salty, and the onion wasn&#8217;t overpowering. A thin cover of bread and a thick layer of cheese helped the soup retain its temperature. It was definitely home-made (well, as &#8220;home&#8221; as a restaurant can get) &#8212; Lipton instant soup this was not. I&#8217;ve had lots of Caesar salads in my day. I&#8217;d even go so far as to almost consider myself an aficionado. I know a good Caesar when I have one. The salad now holds the number two slot of my all-time favourite Caesar salads, following my family&#8217;s. The beer I&#8217;d had before, but was perfect for this sort of meal. I was in heaven. The only thing better would have been to share the moment with someone close to me.<br />
I was proud of myself. I made it through the entire meal, including compliments (at least, I hope they came across as compliments) without slipping into English. Then I got the bill. It wasn&#8217;t the cost that threw me &#8212; I had no idea how to ask to break a $20 bill into two tens. I went through every last scrap of remaining French education in my head. Aside from the hollow echoes of lessons past, I drew a blank. I broke into English. The waiter didn&#8217;t seem to mind at all, replying to me in French. I tipped heavily.<br />
I wandered a little aimlessly, thinking I&#8217;d head up Rue Saint-Jean and seeing what I could see. Along the way, I found Marc, and Rob W. (freshly returned from seeing The Who in Toronto) on their way to an Irish pub. They suggested I tag along. It sounded more interesting than what I had in mind. (I&#8217;d already spent a large portion of the last day and a half on my own, and social interaction was far more appealing.) Gerry appeared across the street. The three of us called him over. Whether he was going to the same pub, I don&#8217;t know. The four of us walked into the pub only to find several of our comrades, already enjoying the ambiance.<br />
Duffy, Rob N., Bill S., Bill C., Tracy, Stefani, Emma, and Cliff welcomed the four of us almost like Norm had just walked in the door. It was a little peculiar trying to imagine that I was sitting in an Irish pub in Vieux Quebec. We could have easily been in any other city along our route. The only indication was a number of signs in French. We talked and drank well into the afternoon, until we realized that we needed to return to the hotel and retrieve our bags. Some took a taxi, but most of us walked. By then, we knew the city well enough not to get lost, and the walk wasn&#8217;t really that far.<br />
We grabbed our things from the hotel, hopped a taxi, and were soon back at the station. (Yes, the train station was closer to the hotel than the pub. But our bags aren&#8217;t exactly light.) We then played our favourite and most oft-played game, &#8220;Hurry Up and Wait&#8221;. Our train wasn&#8217;t there, and couldn&#8217;t come in until after the 17:35 train to Montreal was gone. When the train did finally arrive, we were told we had 15 minutes to board so we could keep to schedule. VIA kept to schedule, now that the Renaissance train is no longer part of our consist.<br />
As the train pulled out into the darkening Quebec City sky, rain was falling. Daryl was miffed because he couldn&#8217;t get a decent shot through the water-streaked windows. Rose and Colleen discussed the shocking news that Ron MacLean had not been resigned for Hockey Night in Canada. (Though both had the opinion that this revelation was far from over.) Cliff and Trish almost dread Campbellton now &#8212; they don&#8217;t want to have to field &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you resign Ron?&#8221; questions.<br />
Following dinner, we broke into small groups to watch movies. Some in the Banff Park watched &#8220;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&#8221;, some were supposed to gather in the Skyline to watch &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; (but never did), and a couple of us took up shop in the dome of the Skyline to watch the director&#8217;s cut of &#8220;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&#8221;. We were at home again. For the next two days and three nights, our last on the train, we would live as we had started &#8212; on the railroad.<br />
We were heading into New Brunswick, and our second-to-last province on this trip.</p>

Day 23<br />
I haven&#8217;t been in Quebec City for 17 years. The last time I was with the Society for Educational Visits and Exchanges in Canada (SEVEC), in the summer following Grade 8. One of the great things about old cities is that they don&#8217;t change quickly.<br />
Today was the event day at the Gare du Palais, Quebec City&#8217;s train station. Normally, this would mean an early start, a lot of work, and a teardown. But plans over the last few weeks had meant only a half-hour&#8217;s worth of work before, and maybe an hour&#8217;s after. This was now a Radio-Canada affair, and our team&#8217;s presence was not required. We ended up with an unexpected day off.<br />
Once the official word came that we were not needed, our group disappeared to the four winds. Some went to Vieux Quebec, some back to the hotel, some to various other parts of the city. I immediately headed towards Chateau Frontenac. It&#8217;s a landmark I felt comfortable enough to branch out in search of familiar things. The tricky part was getting there. (Sans taxi, of course.)<br />
For the first few minutes, I climbed hilly streets I did not recognize. I rounded bends and turned corners I didn&#8217;t remember. Then, at the end of one street, I spotted a McDonald&#8217;s. It was the first time I&#8217;d ever seen a McDonald&#8217;s without one of the giant arches, 17 years ago. I was getting close.<br />
I turned more corners, and began to realize that my memory wasn&#8217;t as good as I&#8217;d believed. I knew I was in the area, but my recollection of where I was going proved to be fuzzy. I found an alley lined with the work of starving artists. Nothing really remarkable to see, but it sparked a faint memory. I quickly skirted around viewers and buyers. About five metres from the end, I slowed down.<br />
A deep feeling, long forgotten, swelled out. It was like frost growing across a cold window, only warm and familiar. I was 13 years old, walking out of the same alley, meeting up with my friends in the square next to Chateau Frontenac. We were on shopping sprees in Basse-Ville, I was buying a kite in a store at the foot of the staircase, eating at the McDonald&#8217;s, running around the Plains of Abraham and looking over the walls of the Citadelle. I was listening to the Art of Noise, wearing all-white clothes, making my first (rather poor) attempts at dating. A youthful grin swept across me.<br />
I knew where everything was, though I could name little of it. Down Terrasse Dufferin, up the stairs to the Plains of Abraham, around La Citadelle, over to the Parliament Builings, and through the St. Louis Gate. It was all familiar, and completely new. Seventeen years vanished, and I was discovering everything for the first time again. I decided I needed to visit La Citadelle.<br />
Quebec City is North America&#8217;s only walled city. La Citadelle is its fort, and is the largest fort in North America. It&#8217;s also still an active military base, something I had not remembered. (You can&#8217;t just wander around it, like at Fort Henry in Kingston, or historical towns like Black Creek Village.) It was a quiet day inside the walls, as most of those on staff were either hard at work, or away for the weekend.<br />
La Citadelle, although originally a French fort and (obviously) based in Quebec, is a British establishment. When the Wolfe defeated Montcalm at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the British took control of the fort, and greatly expanded it. Today, it&#8217;s North America&#8217;s largest. It is also one of the homes of the Governor General of Canada &#8212; a permanent residence is maintained for when Ms. Clarkson spends her time here in Quebec. (It&#8217;s mostly a political move so that the second-highest politician of the nation &#8212; after Queen Elizabeth &#8212; doesn&#8217;t show favouritism for English Canada.)<br />
Leaving the battlements behind, I returned to the Chateau to head into the Lower Town (Basse-Ville). The stores and restaurants have changed (except the sex shop, which looks like the same one I&#8217;d seen 17 years earlier), but the landmarks were the same. While taking a picture of l&#8217;Escalier Casse-Cou, I heard my name called from below. I found Bill and Bill, enjoying beers at one of the restaurants on the stairway.<br />
The tour took me through Lower Town, long the narrow cobble-stone streets, and slowly back up the hill. I rounded Université Laval, along the walls, and eventually back to the railway station. The event was in full swing, and I wanted to see what Radio-Canada was doing in our place.<br />
The activity was high. Our tents were in front of the station, filled with Radio-Canada information, manned by Radio-Canada staff. The line to see the train ran from well inside the station, out the front doors, and up the garden path. The show outside was loud &#8212; cheerleaders and gymnasts cavorted to bad pop music. Daryl was filming, and seemed to have the same poor view of the show that I did. Radio-Canada had pulled together very little content &#8212; it almost looked like a high-school science fair. But everyone seemed to like it, so I guess it worked out in the end.<br />
Inside, people waited patiently to see the museum. Out on the platform, VIA &#8220;entertained&#8221; visitors with loud music, smoke machines, and special lighting. It almost felt like a nightclub. This was the first venue, I think, where visitors didn&#8217;t really have much of a choice of where they went. It was carefully mapped out to go through the Renaissance cars first, and then through the museum.<br />
Neil, Julie, Analisa, Debbie, and Rose remained to help Radio-Canada. I only saw Neil, Julie, and Rose. They were unsure of the event, as none of them spoke French well enough to determine how people were enjoying themselves. (We later found out that the line&#8217;s length was due to how long people were spending in the museum. Most of our visitors have walked through in 12-15 minutes. Some of the visitors in Quebec City were reading everything. There&#8217;s a lot of text in that museum.) I saw only a few people leave the line and give up on seeing anything.<br />
As I was available, I was quickly tasked with a simple job: take more ballots out to the information table, and a lavender pillowcase to clean out the now-full ballot box. The staff out front didn&#8217;t know who I was at first. I managed to explain I was there to help. The new ballots did a lot to support that. I emptied the ballot box, as the volunteers there were quite busy.<br />
Several people started asking me questions. In French. I couldn&#8217;t understand a word. I felt ashamed. I took French in school for nine years. In those nine years, I never learned to carry out a full conversation without asking for help. Over a decade later, I could barely make out a simple sentence. One of these days, I&#8217;m either going to move to Montreal for a year, or maybe even Paris.<br />
I returned to the hotel to ease my weary feet. I don&#8217;t know how far I&#8217;ve walked today, but it&#8217;s not a short distance. It&#8217;s been a while since my feet have hurt this much. After all the standing, walking, hauling, and what-not, I thought my feet would be conditioned to this sort of abuse. I ended up falling asleep for an hour. Quite enjoyable, I must say.<br />
When I returned for teardown, the event was already long over, and the only thing left were the tents. The technical crew were already hard at work. Although the rest of the team has become quite skilled at assembling and taking down tents, it&#8217;s something else to watch the professionals. They make it look easy. Bill C. doesn&#8217;t even use the Magic Prybar (the tool the rest of us use to pop the tent canvas of the frame) &#8212; he pulled it out like someone would tighten shoelaces.<br />
We packed up the tents and took them back to the baggage car. The stanchions and tables were already put away. Then it was off to dinner. Some went one way, others another. Several of us headed up to Rue St-Anne in Vieux Quebec for a Swiss-styled dinner. Neil, Emma, Analisa, and I stayed only long enough for a drink. We&#8217;d sort of already had an idea to go somewhere else, but thought we&#8217;d at least give the restaurant a shot. But the service and menu didn&#8217;t thrill us. We bolted for something more significant.<br />
At the railway station.<br />
We had hoped to meet up with others at Charbon, a steakhouse in the railway station. We ended up meeting up with Daryl, who had arrived well before us, and had mostly eaten alone. While the four of us ate our meal, Daryl enjoyed a post-meal chat and apperatif at an adjacent empty. Marc, Tracy, Trish, and Cliff appeared later on, but sat away from us.<br />
After dinner, most returned to the hotel before heading out onto the town. I returned to Vieux Quebec. I wasn&#8217;t about to let a perfectly good night go to waste. Not when there were photographs to be taken. (Can you tell I&#8217;m a little obsessed about photography?) Following a route similar to this morning&#8217;s, I circled the old part of town. Tourists were in bed, as were the locals. I saw no more than 20 people the entire time, and perhaps no more than 35 cars.<br />
I finally had to pull myself away and return to bed, close to 02:00. As much as I love this city, I didn&#8217;t want to stay up all night.</p>

Day 22<br />
Were it not for banging pipes in the ceiling (I wasn&#8217;t the only one who heard them while at that hotel), I might have slept in longer. As it turns out, the noise got me moving a little faster, giving me more time in the day. We weren&#8217;t leaving town until after 17:00, which meant lots of time for us to see Montreal.<br />
The technical crew (except Rob W., who was back in Toronto taking his kids to see &#8220;The Who&#8221;) left early this morning for Quebec City. They&#8217;re helping out with a broadcast using the tents we&#8217;ve been carrying in the train. (A Radio-Canada truck drove the tents out last night.) So today, it&#8217;s just the production staff.<br />
Most of us had saved money to spend in Montreal. No longer Canada&#8217;s largest city, it still reigns as the fashion capital. It seemed everyone wanted to go shopping. Well, except me. Today was my day to be an outright train geek. I intended to spend the day out of town, in Delson/St. Constant.<br />
For railfans in Canada, Delson/St. Constant is almost a kind of Mecca. It&#8217;s the home of the Canadian Railway Museum. Some of Canada&#8217;s most famous pieces of railway history are preserved there, awaiting discovery by the rail-curious. Ever since getting involved with the railway community, this was a trip I&#8217;ve wanted to make. When I was granted the honour of assisting with the CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train, and the schedule permitted, visiting the CRM became a personal priority.<br />
Getting out to Delson/St. Constant was a challenge. It&#8217;s a bit of a distance out of the city. The &#8220;Museum Train&#8221; didn&#8217;t seem to be running, and public transit is completely out of the question. Naturally, I figured on a rental car. The nearest rental outlet, a Budget, was cleaned out. Calling around, I found nary a rental car was available in Montreal. That meant only one thing: a taxi. Worse still, my driver didn&#8217;t know where St. Constant was, nor had ever heard of the museum (admittely, not entirely unsurprising). And the CRM&#8217;s website had a vague map, but no details. (It turns out that the map is surprisingly accurate.)<br />
A taxi ride from downtown Montreal to the distant outskirts is about $40. And that&#8217;s travelling on highways, with me navigating from the back seat. The museum itself is not visible from Route 209 in St. Constant. The only indication is Old Sydney Collieries 2-4-0 #25 that sits next to the road. A little further down is a sign that provides the real clue. Follow a short dirt road, round a corner, and the transplanted Hayes railway station comes into view.<br />
I stopped at the ticket booth to purchase admission. The clerk cheerily said that admission today was waived for some cultural event. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what that meant, but free is always good! I headed on in, and made a beeline for the main station house and information centre.<br />
Founded in 1932, the Canadian Railroad Historical Association is Canada&#8217;s oldest and largest historical railway organization. In 1950, the group took possession of its first piece of equipment, a retired Montreal streetcar. Nine years later, there were enough artefacts to open a museum. The Canadian Railway Museum was founded in 1961, and opened its doors in 1965. Currently, the CRM is working on an expansion called ExpoRail, which will provide a greater interpretive experience for those visiting the museum.<br />
The museum currently consists of a large rail yard, ringed by an electrified rail for streetcars (they circle the museum, offering patrons rides). There are two stations at the museum, Hayes station near the entrance, and Barrington station at the opposite end. It is with some interest that I discovered that the Hayes station is named for, you guessed it, Charles Melville Hayes. The same guy whose middle name gave Melville, SK its name. The railroading world is a small one &#8230; and thankfully, without the singing dolls. Obtaining information at the information centre in the Hayes station, I quickly hustled down to the Barrington Station for my tour. The group also consisted of a model railroading group from Kingston.<br />
Our tour took us only through the locomotive house, which was pretty much all we wanted to see. I had hoped that the guide would have extensive knowledge on the locomotives, where they came from, how they got here, and an interesting story or two behind them. The tour guide, sadly, wasn&#8217;t terribly knowledgeable in railroadiana. She knew the items we were looking at, but history beyond that, or of other items in North America she knew little. The modellers and I frequently added in extra information. (I frequently corrected not only the guide, but also the modellers. It scared me to realize just how much about trains I&#8217;ve learned in the last year and a half.)<br />
The tour over, I returned to taking pictures. In the locomotive house are some of Canada&#8217;s most famous steam locomotives, including CN 4100 (the first locomotive the newly-formed Canadian National Railways ordered, and the last Santa Fe type steam locomotive remaining in Canada), CP 2850 (the original Royal Hudson that towed the Royal Train in 1939), The Flying Scotsman (donated to the Dominion of Canada in 1937 by Britain), and CP 5935 (one of two remaining Selkirks, the largest locomotives ever used on Canadian rails). It&#8217;s a steam buff&#8217;s paradise. There were also two vintage diesels in the house: CN 77 (CN&#8217;s first diesel electric, and possibly the oddest locomotive I&#8217;ve ever seen), and CP 8905 (the last remaining &#8220;Trainmaster&#8221; locomotive in the world).<br />
I wandered around the yards, taking more pictures of equipment sitting in the yard. More steam locomotives sat out there, along with the majority of diesel electric locomotives. The diesels were mostly in good shape, a few that need restoration. I had to be a little watchful while walking around &#8212; the museum was running an active steam engine, a replica of the John Molson, back and forth on one of the open sections of track. (Most avid steam fans in Canada don&#8217;t really regard the John Molson as a part of the collection. It is a replica of the original, built in 1970 for use at the museum. I&#8217;ve heard it referred to as a &#8220;toy&#8221;.)<br />
Most of the museum&#8217;s collection is in good order. Some of the items need painting, some a serious overhaul. Some other items in the collection, sadly mostly steam locomotives, are harder to look at: they are decayed, and probably barely salvageable. They sit in a nearly-hidden side track, down a path marked with a forbidden entry sign. It&#8217;s sad to look at these once-proud machines, knowing that with funding they could have been saved.<br />
As I wandered, I learned that today was an auspicious day for the museum. According to the modellers (I kept running into them), in addition to it being a cultural day, there was a large announcement at 14:00. Luckily for me, that fit almost exactly into my schedule. Well, it ended up fitting into my schedule. Originally, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to stay that long without becoming bored. I suppose trains are pretty good at keeping my interest.<br />
If any press attended the speed, I couldn&#8217;t tell. As most of it was in French, I also don&#8217;t know exactly what was said. I do know enough French to get the gist. Today was the official launch of a new book written by and for the museum. It&#8217;s a collection of portraits and text about the museum&#8217;s collection. As soon as the speeches ended, the book went on sale in the giftshop. I bought the first English copy.<br />
I called my cab (the driver had given me his number), and waited for his arrival. This game me ample time for a snack (an ice cream cone &#8212; all I could find), and read my new book. Returning to Montreal, I had the taxi driver drop me off on the waterfront, near the entrance to the Lachine Canal. The sunlight cast wonderful shadows on the massive concrete grain elevators, and the rust on the metal portions exhibited classic industrial decay. And I wanted pictures.<br />
Near the mouth of the canal was a large inukshuk. Unlike normal ones, this was made from &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t actually know. It&#8217;s hard to tell. It looked like a large wire mesh that contained peat moss, with grasses and small plants sprouting from all over. I can only assume that this was the original intention. Walking down towards the hotel, I found an old tugboat that had once plied the waters. An excellent black and white subject. I ran into Daryl along the way, returning from an excursion of his own around Montreal. He was off to find an external hard drive for his computer. I continued taking pictures almost until I got back to the hotel.<br />
We congregated in the hotel&#8217;s lobby. It seemed everyone except me had gone shopping during the day. I get the feeling many of us will be mailing packages home just so we can zip up our luggage.<br />
Around 17:15, when we departed for VIA&#8217;s Montreal Maintenance Centre. This was also when we ran headlong into traffic. Why the traffic was so heavy downtown Montreal on a weekend escaped us. But we had to escape it. The train would leave without us if we didn&#8217;t arrive on time.<br />
I would love to have given everyone on our trip a GPS transmitter so we could have plotted the cabs. I can only imagine the scene of half a dozen taxis bombing around the city streets, weaving in and out of traffic, travelling a labyrinth of side streets. We all eventually merged back together as we arrived at MMC.<br />
Our last VIA crew was there, waiting for us. We&#8217;ve had three crews already. Some long lived (Vancouver-Winnipeg), some very short (Winnipeg-Toronto). We were greeted with cards left on every berth and on every door. They are certainly off to a great start!<br />
We pulled out of Montreal, watching the glowing skyline as we crossed the Victoria Bridge. We didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; Montreal is far too exciting a city to stay for such a short time.<br />
The trip from Montreal to Quebec City was fairly brief. We arrived around 23:00, pulling into the Gare du Palais. It was a much faster arrival that previous stops. Probably because we didn&#8217;t split the train or do anything else fancy. We just wanted off. Grabbing our bags, we headed off, yet again, to a hotel. All these hotels are beginning to weigh on us, I think. There is a certain consistency to our train bunks.<br />
We had to wait a long time for a cab. When one finally showed up, one of the priorities was to get Stefani in it. She was carrying Bill C.&#8217;s insulin, which he&#8217;d accidentally forgotten on the train. A few mildly concerned phone calls during the day had given us the impression that he needed his medicine quickly. As we drove, we spotted the technical crew walking back from one of the local bars. Bill didn&#8217;t seem as relieved as we&#8217;d expected.</p>

Day 21<br />
We came. They saw. It rained.<br />
I&#8217;d been looking forward to the Montreal event. This is a great city to be in, and I was sure lots of people would come out. We were so certain of ourselves that there was nothing that could dampen our spirits.<br />
Except the remnants of Tropical Storm Isidore.<br />
When we&#8217;d set up this morning, we were prepared for rain. We all knew it was going to rain. The precipitation forecast was at 100%, and the predictions were quiet accurate. We laid down tarps, hung the tent walls, Roger even went out and purchased two large bags of disposable ponchos. We planned the whole day around it raining. And for a time, we were wholly successful.<br />
Je ne suis pas bilingue, and I&#8217;m not the only one. Luckily, this was well-known ahead of time. Our local organizers provided fully bilingual volunteers, and the Archives staff who&#8217;d come to Ottawa came out again to run the show, for which I&#8217;m eternally grateful. When we arrived this morning, Radio-Canada arrived armed with signage, posters, and French-language video tape loops aplenty. (We gather the signs were very hastily made after Radio-Canada saw all the English signs in Ottawa, the batch finishing sometime early this morning.) In fact, there was so much help that once we&#8217;d set up the tents and equipment, we had little else to do.<br />
Some of us, like Cliff, even got kicked out of our own tents.<br />
Our set up this day was in Vieux Port (&#8220;Old Port&#8221;), the old shipping port on Montreal&#8217;s waterfront. Some shipping (mostly passenger) still runs out of here, but mostly it&#8217;s for touring and viewing the river. A freight rail line still runs through the area, which is what our train sat on. We were warned to look for trains, but never saw one the entire day.<br />
The schools arrived early, as expected. Into the museum, and around through some of the tents they went. Organized and quiet, I saw little of them &#8212; I&#8217;m not even sure they came by the Nouveau Média tent.<br />
The buzz on the walkie-talkies soon turned to Sheila, specifically Heritage Minister Sheila Copps. I had expected to see her in Ottawa. Instead, she made her appearance in Montreal. Her first visit was to the museum, as expected. I hovered around outside, waiting for a chance to take a picture. Ms. Copps travelled with an entourage that was a little difficult to shoot around, but not impossible. I followed her from the train to the Children&#8217;s tent, to the New Media tent, over to the Boutique, then through News (although I couldn&#8217;t get a decent angle for the picture), and finally to Sports. I didn&#8217;t bother with the radio interview.<br />
I must say that Ms. Copps&#8217; ability to speak French is impressive. For a Hamiltonian who used to do an excellent job of riling southern Ontario, she&#8217;s become a very respectable politician &#8230; if there is such a thing. She spent a lot of time talking with our staff (although I think it was limited mostly to Ivan, Patrick, and Amy &#8212; the local organizer steered Shiela from certain tents quite quickly).<br />
Light rain was falling by the time I got back to the New Media tent. It wasn&#8217;t yet something to worry about, just something to watch. We did partially close one of the walls as a precaution. The writing was on the wall, though &#8212; rain was coming. It was just a matter of time.<br />
The Radio-Canada staff and volunteers were running the tent like they&#8217;d been with us from the start. (Not that there was a lot to do, however &#8212; we weren&#8217;t exactly overwhelmed with visitors.) Like most of the others, I had little to do. Most of the people coming up to us were Francophone, and they wanted to talk to Francophones. My French is too poor to be of use, so I kept my distance. No-one seemed to mind.<br />
The downside of not speaking the language was an inability to obtain feedback. Normally, I&#8217;ll talk with visitors and hear what they liked and disliked. I felt quite awkward asking Radio-Canada staff questions in English, let alone our guests. I was able to learn from others such as Ivan that those who did come were thrilled with the presentations.<br />
The ground that the Boutique sat on was turning into a pond &#8212; the water pooled almost right under the tent itself. Though the merchandise on the counters were fine, the stuff in boxes was getting more than a little damp. In what would be their shortest stint out in the open, the Boutique closed before lunch, and everything packed and put back on the train. They would not be the last tent to go down.<br />
Lunch was another problem. (VIA wasn&#8217;t with us today &#8230; well, our crew wasn&#8217;t with us. The Renaissance crew was out, but we rarely saw them during the show.) Analisa improvised and ordered from St. Hubert. She described it as &#8220;Swiss Chalet, but French&#8221;. That, it ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s food, and I wasn&#8217;t about to complain. There was the issue of the order, though &#8212; specifically, how long it took to arrive. It was almost like a comedy of errors. Analisa placed the order, and we expected delivery. About 30 minutes later, we heard over the walkie-talkies that a guy in a chicken car was at the front entrance. He wasn&#8217;t delivering, though &#8212; he was comfirming the order. Another three-quarters of an hour pass, and finally the delivery arrives. Well, sort of. Someone reported that the chicken man was back, but then no-one could find him. The walkie-talkies started squaking and running afowl of chicken jokes.<br />
During one of my stints in the New Media tent, an unfamiliar face introduced himself to me &#8212; Koceila, my new tent partner. Koceila was with the Radio-Canada Archives project, and would be running out the remainder of the trip with us. Koceila is Franophone, which is something I&#8217;m ecstatic about. Quebec City, Campbellton, and Moncton are either Francophone, or bilingual. I can&#8217;t handle that on my own. And like I&#8217;ve said before, I need someone who is passionate about the Archives site.<br />
Koceila would not be joining us today, though. All he came out for was to install his visual aid into one of the laptops (Koceila has a slight visual impairment &#8212; the aid magnifies printed text with the use of a hand-held scanner). For the previous week (since about the 21st), we&#8217;d been trying to find out what laptop Koceila was supposed to be using. Brenda was not aware of any extra laptop for Archives, nor was I. The mystery was eventually solved when Analisa announced it was hers. So I let Koceila and the technician he brought loose on the laptop to install a PCMCIA card and the optical reader. An hour later, the two had to give up. Our laptops are all Windows 2000, and the drivers for the reader are Windows 95. Koceila said he&#8217;d get along without it.<br />
Just after noon, Isidore paid a visit to Vieux Port. The rain fell harder, and things that had previously been dry started to get wet. The partially-closed wall in New Media was sealed shut. Other tents drew walls as needed. The Children&#8217;s tent put the mural away for fear of damage. (It later came back out under shelter.)<br />
People kept coming. While I spoke with none, the Radio-Canada staff made them all feel welcome. Giveaways always seem to bring out the best in people. That, and dry shelter, which is what the tents offered. Many patrons lingered longer than in most places. I somewhat doubt the possibility of keen interest. The Archives site remained the big feature, as expected. Of course, that was on the &#8220;open side&#8221;, so was also easiest to see.<br />
The rain continued to fall. Debbie came around asking what state the New Media tent was in. I wasn&#8217;t worried, at least not aloud. The water concerned me, but the event was going too well to stop it. I couldn&#8217;t help notice the mud along the edges of the tarp on the ground, and new that it would eventually start seeping under the tables. The computers would be fine &#8212; they sat on top of their packing boxes. But the cables were exposed. I&#8217;d put them on top of a crate earlier in the day, though that really didn&#8217;t matter. Water and computers don&#8217;t mix.<br />
By 15:30, it was officially over for New Media. Water was now almost under the tables, and there were no signs of the rain letting up. The call came over the walkie: &#8220;Strike New Media&#8221;. While I wasn&#8217;t happy about it, I knew there was no choice. Daryl appeared in the tent only moments later to get my reaction on tape. I think I was polite. (I was frustrated, but not by any decisions that were made. It was the weather I didn&#8217;t like.) By the time the last computer was loaded back on the baggage car, water had crept under the tables.<br />
Shortly after New Media started coming down, the other tents shut down. By 17:00, the tents were coming down. By 18:30, the only thing left standing was the New Media tent. Canada Now had appropriated it for a broadcast (which required four of us to carry it, fully assembled, through a garden to put it into place. Only the museum cars were still open.<br />
We were soaked. Not quite as bad as Windsor, but it was a deeper soaking &#8212; sort of like leaving really dirty dishes in the sink overnight. We were cold, wet, and wanting to go back to the hotel. Once the last tent was down, just after 19:05, and the last of the items packed back in the cars, we broke for a hot shower and dinner.<br />
Some took a taxi, but a fair few of us wandered through the rainy night back to our hotel. It felt so good to peel off the layer of wet clothes. My shoes popped off like suction cups. I almost instantly climbed into a shower that ran a good 10 degrees hotter than I usually can stand, just to restore the heat in my body. A warm, dry change of clothes certainly helped. I also had to dry my soaked shoes, as I didn&#8217;t really have anything else suitable to wear. (It&#8217;s amazing what 20 minutes with a hotel hair dryer can do.) Those of us heading out that way piled into cabs and disappeared into the night.<br />
Next up on the table was dinner. Rose suggested we hit a restaurant that let you bring your own wine, a fairly popular concept in Montreal. I don&#8217;t fully remember where we ended up. It was an area of town with a lot of neat little restaurants. Definitely not a heavy tourist area. We each purchased a bottle of wine at a nearby depanneur (I could already feel a hangover coming on), and headed to our restaurant. Rose almost immediate suggested we leave &#8212; this was a restaurant she knew too well. We went to the one across the street. There were a fair number of us (those that I can recall include Neil, Julie, Rose, Roger, Emma, and I think Analisa), but we were the only ones there. Fine with us.<br />
Isidore left town before midnight. With the rain gone, Montreal glistened like a gem. It could have been perhaps our best event, were it not for the weather. It&#8217;s days like these when I wish we had more than one public event in each city.</p>

Day 20<br />
Today was a travel day. It seems a bit odd, since Montreal is so close to Ottawa. But that&#8217;s the schedule. We weren&#8217;t about to complain. After an 18-hour marathon event yesterday (getting up to going to bed, that is), a day in travel was something to look forward to. Especially when we get to travel during the day.<br />
Arising earlier than needed, I took the opportunity to wander around Ottawa, specifically the Parliament Buildings. Having lived in Ottawa before, I&#8217;d been to Parliament Hill many times. I needed pictures for the website, and also for myself (you never think to do tourism in the city you live &#8212; it&#8217;s not until you live somewhere else that you wish you had pictures). Clear mornings are the best for catching colour.<br />
I got my requisite pictures of the Parliament Buildings, and proceeded to wander around. My original plan was to go around back, shoot the library, and maybe across the river. But as I rounded the West Block, I spotted something I&#8217;d never seen before.<br />
In a fenced-area area off to the west side is something called &#8220;Stray Cats of the Hill&#8221;. Since the 1970s, cats have lived in protected seclusion, in a custom-built dog, er, cathouse. (I suspect the current cats are either descendants of the original stray cats, or are new additions.) Today, the &#8220;Catman of the Hill&#8221; maintains the house and feeds the animals (it is in no way associated with the Federal Government, in case you&#8217;re worried that your hard-paid tax dollars are going to the dogs, er, cats). An interesting thing to find while prowling the Hill.<br />
Heading back to the hotel, I managed to catch the Supreme Court of Canada building in perfect morning sunlight. The only thing that would have made it better would have been if the roof had corroded enough to turn green. Replaced only a few years ago, the copper roof had only turned a dark brown. The green won&#8217;t show up for a few more years still.<br />
We headed over to the train station at 10:30. There we had to wait for our train to become available. I asked John when we could get on, and he replied that there had been a minor complication with the train, so we were a little late. I was curious to know. At first, he wouldn&#8217;t say, but it doesn&#8217;t take much to get one railfan to tell another railfan what was going on. Apparently, someone had accidentally left the brakes on the P42 (#907) when returning from the museum during the night. The wheels were gouged, making the engine incapable of travel.<br />
Somehow, I considered this poetic justice for the grief VIA had wrought on us since the Renaissance Train had joined us.<br />
We boarded the train at Ottawa&#8217;s VIA Rail station around 10:45. We would not depart the station for a little over an hour, assumedly waiting for clearance on the track. As we started onto lunch, we began our journey to Montreal. Less than 10 minutes out of Ottawa, we heard the following announcement:<br />
&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, the helicopter is now overhead. You can obtain a clear view of it through the Skyline dome.&#8221;<br />
Daryl had arranged the helicopter in question. This had been a shot Daryl wanted since we left Vancouver. Ideally, it would have been in the Rockies. As we were travelling at night, the helicopter shot would have been wasted. Out of Kamloops, it rained. Saskatoon to Melville would have been excellent with the clear weather, but for some reason, all helicopters run from Melville, and the cost would have been exorbitant. Northern Ontario was deemed unsuitable, mostly due to timing. This, it seemed, was our best (and last) chance.<br />
Originally, Daryl was to shoot from the helicopter himself. He had asked me if I&#8217;d like to come along. (Actually, it was more of an assumption than an inquiry.) Due to problems getting from the helicopter to the train, and due to cost, an Ottawa CBC camera operator flew in Daryl&#8217;s place. I am a little disappointed that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to go, either.<br />
As I couldn&#8217;t get pictures of the train from the helicopter, I opted for pictures of the helicopter from the train. But playing cat and mouse with a helicopter is no easy feat. I wanted a clear shot of the helicopter, preferably with the cameraman. Unfortunately, the train, the terrain, the vegetation, and the pilot didn&#8217;t always agree with me. I took at least 30 pictures, trying to get a nice, clean shot. In the end, it was a lucky shot out the vestibule window.<br />
We covered the short distance between the two cities fairly expediently, arriving in Montreal roughly on time. (I can only assume we made up the time as VIA wasn&#8217;t really interested in getting us any more ticked off than we already were.) We had to run out onto the Victoria Bridge over the St. Lawrence River, before backing into the VIA&#8217;s Montreal Maintenance Centre. Our event tomorrow needs only part of the train, so some will be left behind here. The rest will be taken down and arranged for us. (I assume it&#8217;s too awkward to take our entire train to the Montreal station.)<br />
Our train parked next to the American Orient Express, a very pricey luxury cruise train that makes curcuits of Canada and the United States. The cars on the train are similar in vintage to ours, but underwent an extensive (and expensive) refit to make them some of the most luxurious ever to ride the North American rail system. But even with all the glamour, I&#8217;d take our train in a heartbeat.<br />
Piling into a line of awaiting taxis, we headed to our hotel in Montreal&#8217;s Chinatown. We had a few hours to spare. We also had few rooms to check into &#8212; most of us had to store our bags and wait for the rooms to become available. After checking in, we all wandered off to see what we could see. I love this city. I&#8217;d love to spend more time here. It&#8217;s energetic, it&#8217;s always interesting, and has some of the most beautiful buildings, streets, artwork, and people I&#8217;ve seen. The only thing better than Montreal on a sunny day is Montreal at night.<br />
The entire group had been invited to a club that night for cocktails, all arranged by &#8220;Mr. Punctual&#8221; Fred. The only problem was that this place had a dress code: No jeans, and no running shoes. That immediately negated me, and probably a dozen other people. We hadn&#8217;t really carried such clothes with us &#8212; we never saw the need for it, and utility was more of a concern than appearance. Although I suppose I should have planned for that to some degree, considering that we were going to Montreal, and at least one night was likely to be fancy over the course of the trip.<br />
Ivan and I decided to wander a bit and see what we could find. The goal was to track down a deli. The delicatessens in Montreal, although legendary, are nowhere near where we went, I think. We walked down towards Notre Dame Cathedral, east to Jacques Cartier, and couldn&#8217;t find a single place that even remotely looked like a deli. Not being completely familiar with Montreal, I can only assume the delis are more towards the original Jewish quarter of the city.<br />
We ended up choosing a somewhat-touristy restaurant on the edge of the boulevard. Like most of the other restaurants we saw, they featured mussels and chips. (Apparently, it&#8217;s a common French dish. I&#8217;ve never seen it before.) Neither of our meals were extraordinary. When you&#8217;re hungry, you don&#8217;t really mind.<br />
After dinner, we headed back to the hotel. Ivan was very patient with me &#8212; I was stopping every so often to take pictures of the city at night. When we arrived back at the hotel, Ivan headed upstairs &#8212; I went back out to take more pictures. I didn&#8217;t stay out too long, though. This stupid cold I&#8217;m harbouring is making me feel a tad icky. I turned in a little early (even when many others were heading out to some great club somewhere) to get this thing out of my system.<br />
I ran into Stefani at the entrance of the hotel. She and Bill C. are running out to join the others at a club &#8212; a different one than everyone started off at. She was a little baffled at the picture I was taking of &#8230; well, traffic. I was interested in lights. I love light. And moving light is a personal favourite. I had to show Stefani and Bill what I was trying to do. Both suggested that I put my camera away (I wonder if everyone thinks the same thing) and join them. The thought of going out is very tempting, but I can just see this cold turning into something worse.<br />
There are times I hate being responsible.</p>

Day 19<br />
The tech crew had a really early call this morning &#8212; they were at the train long before the rest of us. They had to make sure that everything was ready with the museum cars before the schools started showing up at 08:00. We arrived by 07:30 so we could finish setting up tents and prepare for the expected deluge of people.<br />
Terri, Elizabeth, and I began our set up almost immediately. Once shown how to set up one computer, they handled the remaining eight. That gave me time to find all the missing equipment and boxes. This is a constant problem. Although we generally pack things in the same place every time, the smaller items (the ShowVote ballots, bookmarks, pens, mousepads, and bags) have legs and are always moving around. It never fails: I always spend about 30 minutes looking for this stuff. Strangely enough, though, I kinda like it.<br />
As the last of the computers were hooked up, three strangers arrived at our tent. Francois, Genvieve, and Christiane, from Archives at Radio-Canada in Montreal. They had come out to represent their interests and assist us with our display. Although at first confused (I wasn&#8217;t aware they were coming), I was very happy to see them. I didn&#8217;t want to travel the rest of Canada without an Archives expert, and they were all bilingual. (Ma francais n&#8217;est pas bien.) And although I had put in a request to make sure I got a French-speaking volunteer, we had a problem getting any.<br />
Apparently, Brenda did know they were coming, but because of the hectic pace at which things were set up, she simply forgot to tell me. It wasn&#8217;t a big deal &#8212; having them there was a blessing. I hate running the Archives without someone who actually knows it. Debbie was amazing at promoting the Archives &#8212; she&#8217;d make a great salesperson. Francois, Genvieve, and Christiane were also exceptionally good, and answered virtually any question someone asked. I&#8217;d be really curious to know if the traffic to the Archives site goes up as a result of this trip.<br />
The floodgates opened when the school busses arrived. I have no idea exactly how many busses there were, but we had more children before noon than we&#8217;d had people at both our Windsor events combined. Unlike our Winnipeg event, there wasn&#8217;t the chaos. Teachers ruled their students with iron fists and kept them all in check. Busy, but manageable. Everyone went away with smiles.<br />
Well, almost everyone. Although I didn&#8217;t encounter this woman directly, we received a complaint that we were completely unorganized when it came to children&#8217;s activities. This had all of us confused. The Children&#8217;s tent has always contained activities for children, and all of our tents are child-accessible. Unfortunately, I never heard specific faults or what we could have done better. The only thing I could think of was that someone had expected actual events, like you&#8217;d find at museums (e.g. a &#8220;scavenger hunt&#8221; for information). Emma and Stefani have enough on their hands without running something like that.<br />
Another visitor, a former employee of CBC, had warned us of a potential flood of people starting around 17:00, when offices were out and people started rushing to see the museum. It was a wise piece of advice, although there was little we could do to prepare for it. The rush never came, though. As noon turned to afternoon, the flood turned to a steady flow, trickling off in the last two hours.<br />
The schools had primarily brought their students to see the museum. But some schools decided to make a little more of the excursion. (In other words, they planned the activities.) One class of students, from Riverview Alternative, were embroiled in a journalism contest. They were tasked with interviewing the CBC staff for their projects. When one of them found out I work for CBC, I was suddenly surrounded by inquisitive faces.<br />
Okay, technically, I&#8217;m only a contractor. I&#8217;m not a full employee. But for the purpose of this trip, I was told very clearly by Brenda that I am a CBC employee, and I should always say that when asked. My actual contract doesn&#8217;t say anything like that, so I can only assume it&#8217;s to keep an air of consistency. It&#8217;s fine with me. Actually, I still find it quite an honour to be asked to help Canada&#8217;s national broadcaster in such a way. It&#8217;s almost like giving back to the company that gave me so much. (Almost &#8212; I still think I&#8217;m getting more out of this than I&#8217;m putting in.)<br />
The first student was Peter. He had a list of questions, starting included my name, how long I&#8217;ve worked for CBC, what I like most about the events we do, and if I&#8217;d ever interviewed a student before. I answered all his questions (though I answered &#8220;I&#8217;ve been involved with this project for three months&#8221;, rather than say &#8220;I&#8217;ve been with the CBC for 25 days&#8221;), giving him time to write down his answers. Being one not miss a golden opportunity, I turned the tables. (Besides, it looks good for these journals.)<br />
Peter, like those surrounding me, was from Riverview Alternative. Not wearing my thinking cap, I neglected to ask the grade. (As I&#8217;m not a journalist, my ability to ask questions off the top of my head is a little weak. It&#8217;s a skill I&#8217;ll need to work on.) Peter&#8217;s class had come to the museum on a field trip to see the CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train. Peter was also interested in seeing who would win the journalism contest. When asked what career he was working towards, he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m working on that&#8221;.<br />
Bent down on one knee, I was shorter than the children surrounding me. I had hoped it would make me more approachable. Either that worked, or these kids were really keen to be interviewed.<br />
Taking a selection at random, I picked a girl named Samah. She asked me her questions, then I asked mine. Also in Peter&#8217;s class, Samah was here to see the train. Unlike Peter, she didn&#8217;t seem too preoccupied with the contest. I added a new question this time: what have you seen so far? (I wasn&#8217;t sure if they&#8217;d been through the museum.) Samah had already been to the Children&#8217;s tent, and had particularly liked the bubble table. (She said her class would see the train after lunch.)<br />
A forest of hands accompanied with cries of &#8220;me next!&#8221; presented a problem &#8212; too many choices. I opted for Hanady, the next nearest person. She, like Samah, also liked the bubble tables most, but had also seen the New Media displays. I was quite happy to hear that. Hanady&#8217;s wish for later life is in law enforcement.<br />
At that point, I had to call a stop &#8212; as much as I would have loved to interview them all, it would have taken too long. Though disappointed, they understood. One last boy, whose name I regrettably did not write down, asked for an interview. Very articulate, he asked the questions much in the matter of a television interview &#8212; clearly, and with deliberate articulation. At the end, he thanked me for my time, and even shook my hand. I see a future for him in journalism.<br />
Performances from the stage came on and off all day. This included Anthony Maclean with Infomatrix, some from Wayne Rostad with On the Road Again, and of course, Frank Leahy and Friends (which we think will be their last performance with us &#8212; though there is a little hope of them coming to Halifax). One was from the Royal Canadian Air Farce. We&#8217;ve seen them several times now since leaving Vancouver. Their energy impresses me. (Mind you, the energy of the train crew impresses me far more. The Air Farce has only been out to some of our shows. We&#8217;ve had to do all of them, yet we still smile and are as energetic with every new person as we were with the first ones in Vancouver.) But it&#8217;s getting tiring &#8230; especially Luba Goy. Her duck impression is, well, annoying. And when she&#8217;s &#8220;Really On&#8221;, she doesn&#8217;t know when to stop.<br />
Because there were six of us manning the New Media tent, I was able to spend more time wandering around the site. Radio-Canada made an effort to bring local television talent, especially from children&#8217;s shows. It was easy to snap pictures of them interacting with children. That also set me up as a target for Radio-Canada.<br />
I was approached by one of the Radio-Canada staff &#8212; she wanted some pictures taken, primiarly of the local talent they brought in. But then they snuck in one more thing: They wanted pictures taken of all the signs. Why? One reason (at least that we can discern): All the signs were in English. Much earlier in the project, the management team had asked Radio-Canada for input. As none was ever received, the signs were printed only in English. Radio-Canada, at least from what I could gather, was not pleased. I can only gather they wanted the pictures for evidence. The request, however, was countermanded when Rose and Julie came up to me and asked what was going on. There&#8217;s nothing like getting caught in the middle. Making a decision wasn&#8217;t too hard, though &#8212; I report to the English side of CBC.<br />
Once the schools began to depart, the site quietened down. This allowed more time to talk to those who came to the New Media tent. All of them were so happy we had come. Three women were looking for the Royal Canadian Air Farce, and were a little disappointed to hear they&#8217;d missed hearing them on stage. A man, who couldn&#8217;t be any older than myself, was almost crushed when I wouldn&#8217;t reveal what was really inside Mr. Dressup&#8217;s Tickle Trunk. (If people only knew that it contains Duffy&#8217;s tools.)<br />
As I wandered back from my late lunch, Daryl pulled me aside to meet a man, retired for 14 years. He has read my journals online, which brought back memories of riding in the Banff Park car, when it had been with Canadian Pacific Railway. This man was another early pioneer, having helped build the microwave network from Winnipeg to Vancouver, through the Crowsnest Pass. He seemed almost misty-eyed when telling stories of raising a 300-foot tower on top of a 3,500-foot mountain in the middle of the night, when the winds didn&#8217;t howl. Of the journey on which we are embarked, he had this to say:<br />
&#8220;You can&#8217;t appreciate it if you&#8217;ve never seen it.&#8221;<br />
I think this is the first real sign of a big problem we&#8217;re all going to have when we get back to &#8220;reality&#8221;. Sooner or later, we&#8217;re all going to get the question: &#8220;What was it like?&#8221; I have no idea how I&#8217;m going to answer that. We&#8217;ve done so much and seen so much that it completely escapes me how to explain it. I&#8217;m a big fan of experiences &#8212; some of my favourite trips have been insanely paced, much like this one. But they&#8217;re short, usually less than two weeks. It&#8217;s a little easier. But this is so completely beyond my abilities that I have no idea what I&#8217;m going to do. I guess the only thing I can hope for is that there will be a documentary on this.<br />
Of the tasks I had set myself to accomplish, one was to take a picture of ex-CPR 1201, a Pacific-class steam locomotive currently housed by the museum. The last locomotive built by CP&#8217;s Angus Shop in Montreal, #1201 had been protected from the scrapper&#8217;s torch by the locomotive crews. (The story goes that when CP started looking for the locomotive, they could never find it &#8212; the crews kept moving it around and hiding it.) I wanted a photo of this locomotive. However, it&#8217;s stored in the Science and Technology Museum&#8217;s warehouse, and is not open to the public. I had hoped to eek my way through with the curator, but couldn&#8217;t connect with him in time. Serves me right for waiting to the last minute.<br />
Instead, I settled for pictures of ex-CN 6400, the last of five streamlined Northern-class steam locomotives (sometimes referred to as Confederation class); and of ex-CP 3100, one of only two Northern-class locomotives built for Canadian Pacific. They are beautiful examples of Canadian steam locomotive engineering.<br />
As afternoon crept along, I gave my friend Rebecca a call. Although I&#8217;d seen her and her family a scant couple of months earlier, I had hoped they might be able to come out and see the train. However, a few phone calls back and forth pretty much kiboshed the idea &#8212; too many things going on, and the traffic wasn&#8217;t really accommodating at that time of the day.<br />
Twelve hours passes a lot faster than you might think. We had what I think was our best event yet. So many people came out to see our show, and so many walked away with memories anew and renewed. Before we knew it, the sun was setting, and our tents illuminated from the lights within. The crowds were thin. Slowly, we started to pack ourselves up.<br />
Long days such as this can really wear one out. But though we were tired and exhausted, there was the feeling of success. We had gone through the longest day on our schedule without serious complications or complaints. There had been the odd hiccup, but nothing more serious than anything we had dealt with before &#8230; not counting Winnipeg.<br />
When the call to break came, everyone bolted for the line of taxis waiting for us. It almost seemd a race back to the hotel, though why I&#8217;m not sure. I bade farewell to Terri and Elizabeth, as I don&#8217;t expect to see them tomorrow. It was across the street again for a post-event celebration. We&#8217;re getting good at these.</p>

Day 18<br />
Ivan and I met arrived at Union Station at almost the same time, but from opposite ends of the GTA. Both of us had taken the GO Train to downtown. We met, as planned days earlier, under the clock in the centre of the Union Station upper atrium. The arranged meeting time was 9:15; Ivan and I were a good 45 minutes ahead of schedule (mostly due to how frequently the GO Trains run in the morning &#8212; though for me, it was also making sure I was punctual). We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Harvey&#8217;s while we waited.<br />
One by one, people slowly began to arrive. Sometimes in twos, but usually individually. While we were waiting around for more people, Daryl pointed out a book on sale at an adjacent kiosk. It was a photography book whose subjects were railroad-oriented (not necessarily trains). The pictures were mostly black and white. All of them were strangely mesmerizing &#8212; things you wouldn&#8217;t normally think to take pictures of. And for $10, you certainly can&#8217;t go wrong!<br />
The crew had almost all arrived by 9:15, at which time we headed into the train. Although everyone who could go home (a few of us live out of town) enjoyed sleeping in their own beds and being with family, every second utterance I heard as we climbed aboard was &#8220;it&#8217;s good to be home&#8221;.<br />
Many of us, including myself, are now fighting off a cold. Illness spreads quickly when people are in confined spaces for long lengths of time. (That, combined with lack of sleep and lots of stress, usually do a number on the human immune system.) Luckily, it&#8217;s nothing serious, just your run-of-the-train kind of rhinovirus. More annoying than debilitating.<br />
We said farewell to Jason, Debbie, and Ingrid in Toronto. This morning, Lisa joined us to take Jason&#8217;s place. Hopefully she won&#8217;t feel too excluded from our group &#8212; I suspect it won&#8217;t take long for her to blend in. We have no replacement for Ingrid, and I&#8217;ll be on my own until we get to Montreal. For a while, I&#8217;ll know how Cliff must have felt in the first couple of weeks, before Trish joined us.<br />
The trip to Ottawa was fairly expedient. I&#8217;d taken the train between Ottawa and Toronto only once before, but that was on an LRC from Ottawa. This time, I rode in the Skyline dome, watching the world pass by in a way I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d see. We were eating lunch when we passed through Kingston. We waved at the dozens of people who lined the platforms waiting for us to pass through<br />
Our trip up the Alexandria Subdivision (Brockville to just south of Ottawa) took a little longer than planned, mostly due to a rail traffic jam. The Alexandria Sub is single track, and if one train is late, it throws the entire schedule off. We ended up a little behind schedule arriving at the Ottawa station. Unfortunately, we never recovered that time. Due to depart the station around 18:00, we didn&#8217;t end up leaving until almost 19:00. (I have no idea why.) At an agonizingly slow speed, we shunted around Ottawa until we could back up the spur to the Canada Science and Technology Museum. While it was torture for us, the train chasers who lined our route must have loved the slow pace.<br />
Arriving over two hours late at the museum, we had to wait while VIA spent over an hour shunting the Renaissance train. The tension level on our train skyrocketed to an all-time high. Even the agony of Winnipeg seemed a dull ache compared to the fury rising in many people. The CBC staff and our VIA crew were about ready to start breaking windows and jumping from open doors. It wasn&#8217;t so much that we were stir-crazy, but that stupid Renaissance train has been putting us behind schedule consistently since we picked it up on the 19th.<br />
Although we never admitted to it publicly at the time, we were ready to do something nasty to the Renaissance train. Something that would prevent it coming with us for the remainder of the trip The delays were intolerable, and inexcuseable. This was supposed to be our show, not VIA&#8217;s, and their constant delays were causing us to miss schedules and inconvenience everyone.<br />
Finally, four hours after we were to start our partial set-up (tents and kiosks), we detrained and proceeded to quickly unload the baggage car. In just over an hour, we erected all the tents, and were ready to finish our set up the following day. We ended up having to do more work than we should have, but mostly because we had to make sure that the museum would be ready for operation in the morning &#8212; the schools would start early.<br />
Taxis started arriving not shortly after we finished, and we all headed to the hotel to check in. Being a complete idiot, I left my wallet on the train. This made checking in a little more difficult. (It would also make going out troublesome.) I wouldn&#8217;t be able to access any services, but I could at least shower and sleep that night.<br />
The phone in my room already had a message. Terri and Elizabeth, from New Media in Toronto, are joining me for the 12-hour event tomorrow. I&#8217;m very thankful they&#8217;re coming. Doing this with two people is difficult, let alone one. Stretch that over 12 hours, and I&#8217;d be about ready for a long stay in a rubber room by the end of the day.<br />
We broke for a late snack at a pub across the road. I had to beg and borrow due to my lack of foresight (see my wallet comment). Despite all the grumblings earlier in the day, everyone seemed to be in good spirits. In fact, we seem to be really positive about tomorrow&#8217;s event.</p>

Day 17<br />
For the first time since our trip began, I had a day where I didn&#8217;t see a single person from the train. It felt weird.<br />
I spent the day with my family, after sleeping a few extra hours (sleeping in never felt so good). I had hoped to make it a whole day without having to move something. Fate, as it seems, had other ideas in mind. My mother, however, has not completed the move from her home to her condominium.<br />
I&#8217;ll give you three guesses what I was doing for part of the afternoon.<br />
Today I realized just how much this trip has meant to me. I&#8217;ve written many times about the camaraderie, the challenges, and the excitement. But it&#8217;s one thing to write about those things while you&#8217;re amidst the action &#8212; it&#8217;s completely different when you&#8217;re reflecting on it.<br />
That&#8217;s what today was for me: my first chance to ruminate on what we&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s more than just crossing the country by train, though that would be enough for me. It&#8217;s having seen the happy faces of visitors to our exhibits. It&#8217;s having people learn a little about the CBC, and in turn about the culture of Canada. It&#8217;s hearing about how people feel included in something. It&#8217;s about seeing humanity.<br />
Even on board the train, we have our own culture. It&#8217;s a microcosm of life. We live together in a stainless steel box barely 11 feet wide, 20 feet tall (in places), and just over 700 feet long. Submarines have more room than we do. Yet we are happy to be there. We are happy to bring the CBC to places that wouldn&#8217;t normally see the museum. We are happy to tell others that they are as much a part of the CBC as anyone else.<br />
Tomorrow, our trek resumes. I just can&#8217;t wait to get on the road again.</p>

Day 16<br />
Five of our team staying at the hotel met in the lobby at 7:15 to walk to Union Station. Only a couple of blocks away, it wasn&#8217;t a long walk. Carrying a full hiking backpack, camera bag, laptop, and duffle bag, I must have been quite the sight walking down Front Street.<br />
Finding our train on Track 1, I dumped my bags in the Park car, and awaited instructions. We had to be ready for 11:00. And the train was pointing in the wrong direction. To solve this, we completely unloaded the baggage car into the Skywalk so the train could go out to turn around. We had one hour.<br />
Packing and unpacking the train used to be stressful. It used to be difficult. Now it&#8217;s routine. The running joke was that we&#8217;d have it all worked out when we got to Halifax. Who knew it would be before Toronto?<br />
We were setting up in two locations in and around Union Station. News, Children&#8217;s, and the Boutique took up home in the Skywalk. Sports and New Media were slated for outside, along Front Street. This wouldn&#8217;t have been quite so bad, except New Media&#8217;s home was behind the stage, downwind from the diesel generators. For the first time since this tour started, I was angry.<br />
It seemed as if New Media had become an afterthought, wedged off in the corner because no-one else knew what to do with it. The fact that we were behind the stage was just insult upon injury.<br />
I didn&#8217;t want to be outside, even with our lousy location. According to the weather forecast, it was supposed to rain. New Media has nine computers (with nine LCD monitors), and a plasma display. It&#8217;s possibly the most expensive display in our travelling open house. As far as I was concerned, it was either full set-up inside, or as we&#8217;d done in Windsor, a partial outside.<br />
Debbie and I complained. I hate complaining, but we had little choice. Eventually, we won the opportunity to be inside. But all we did was go through the doors. We didn&#8217;t move any closer to the others. We were still isolated. No signage, no pointers, and now even the map was wrong. For the first hour, Debbie and I moped. We were not happy campers, but moving seemed out of the question.<br />
For a while, the people passing New Media were interested only in VIA&#8217;s Renaissance train. This didn&#8217;t exactly make our mood soar. But then people started looking for us. Most of the others in the CBC team were amazed that we&#8217;d been dumped off in a corner, and I think a few people were directed to us. Although we never came close to the crowds we had in Edmonton, we were happy to have people come by, use our computers, and learn a little about the CBC.<br />
Our volunteers were all from the CBC, and were extremely helpful. We all fielded questions, from the simple (&#8220;how do I see the train&#8221;) to the difficult (&#8220;do you have archives of [insert show here]&#8221;).<br />
One such request came from a gentleman who had purchased the book &#8220;Looking Back&#8221;, which covers the history of CBC Television. He had a list of nine classic CBC shows. He wanted to know what month and year the shows had switched from black and white to colour. The five of us, including Julie, just scratched our heads. He didn&#8217;t walk away empty-handed, however, as Julie and Debbie were able to direct him to Audience Relations. A researcher will hopefully soon solve the problem.<br />
As I was finishing helping a woman cast her ShowVote for Beachcombers, I heard my name called out. I turned to see a face I hadn&#8217;t seen for over three years: my friends Jason and Stephanie (with their two children). They had driven over an hour to come down and see the show, and to see me. We talked for a while, before I suggested they get in line for the museum before the line got too long.<br />
About an hour later, our walkie-talkie crackled with &#8220;Geoff Sowrey, what&#8217;s your 20?&#8221; (That&#8217;s radioese for &#8220;where are you&#8221;?) A few minutes later, my Aunt Ruth and cousin Lauren appeared. I was having a field day of visitors. We chatted for a brief time, and I told them what our journey was like, and how much fun (despite all the bruises and lack of sleep) we were having. Little did I know, though, that the call for my whereabouts hadn&#8217;t been from my family.<br />
Debbie (Hynes, not Lindsey) approached, toting two people she had guided down from the Skywalk. Emily and Sydney were looking for me. Both are loyal fans of the CBC, particularly radio. Emily regularly reads the cbc.ca website. That&#8217;s how Emily found the journal entries I write. She&#8217;s been following our exploits since the beginning, and she wanted to meet the person who&#8217;s been writing about them.<br />
Then I got the biggest compliment I&#8217;ve ever had. For years, I&#8217;ve had a few people tell me that my writing is a little wordy (if you&#8217;ve read the previous entries, you&#8217;ve probably figured this out by now). I&#8217;m a descriptive person. It seems, though, that I have the perfect audience: the visually impaired. Both Emily and Sydney are legally blind. They can read with the assistance of magnifying glasses, or leaning in close to monitors using large fonts. That also means that they cannot see what I&#8217;ve seen so far on this trip. My wordiness, however, does allow them to imagine the sights.<br />
Flounders can&#8217;t get any more flattered than I was. I&#8217;ve never had a total stranger come up to me and compliment me on the work that I do. Now I know how famous people must feel like. It&#8217;s very humbling.<br />
While I was revelling in the compliment, Emily proceeded to tell me how she and Sydney lived on a fixed income. And with $16 of their last $20 of the month, had travelled from Hamilton to Toronto, using whatever means possible. Just so they could meet me.<br />
I almost cried. My aunt and cousin, who were sitting nearby, took pictures of us for posterity.<br />
We talked probably for over an hour before Emily and Sydney carried on their tour of Toronto. My aunt and cousin left shortly after. Then I finally got to have lunch, with my friend Kim and her friend Rob.<br />
The afternoon disappeared quickly, and soon it was time to start taking down our equipment. Striking the set was immeasurably easier than putting it together, partly because there was no question where we were going. Also because our volunteers needed no guidance for putting things back in boxes.<br />
Without trying, we packed up in two hours. After a quick debriefing, we were off in different directions again. This time, however, I was off to Oakville to visit with family. Tomorrow, we have our second day off. It will be the first day we&#8217;ll all be away from each other. The feeling is a little strange.<br />
Originally going to take the GO Train, my family insisted I take a taxi. They wanted me home for dinner, and the train would have taken too long. I rode to Oakville, all the while thinking about how, in some small way, I&#8217;d made a difference in someone&#8217;s life. Someone who had never met my family, my friends, or me, had known who I was and come looking. I might not have signed any autographs, but that didn&#8217;t make the experience any less important. This is truly a day to remember. I have experienced my true 15 minutes of fame.<br />
I&#8217;m ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille&#8230;</p>

Day 15<br />
If it&#8217;s the 21st, it must be London. We can&#8217;t tell you the day of the week; we just know where we are. Cities have become our days. We ask each other: &#8220;What day is it?&#8221; The answer is: &#8220;Melville&#8221;, or &#8220;Windsor&#8221;, or &#8220;Travel&#8221;. You could come up to us and say &#8220;today is Thursday&#8221;, and we&#8217;ll just nod our heads.<br />
London is the first event that&#8217;s not really our event. It&#8217;s actually VIA&#8217;s. VIA is promoting their new Renaissance trains throughout the Montreal-Windsor corridor. We have a P42 and a six-car renaissance car consist as part of our train. We separate the trains when we come to a station.<br />
This was another minimalist event &#8212; no tents, no kiosks. The museum was open, the Boutique and the Information desk were set up in the tunnel from the station to Tracks 2 and 3. There&#8217;s nothing like a captive audience.<br />
At first, we thought the day would be a write-off. People were coming to see VIA &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t advertised our presence in London. But as morning became afternoon, more and more people came out to see us. For about an hour, we had a line-up at the Information desk at least 50 people long! It took three people to madly stuff items into the gift bags for the visitors. One thing I&#8217;ll give Londoners: They&#8217;re very polite, and very patient.<br />
People streamed in steadily all day. Almost all of them signed their names and comments in our guest book. A few people, especially those aged about 28-40, repeatedly commented on the museum. &#8220;So wonderful that you brought it here&#8221;, and &#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d get to touch the Friendly Giant&#8217;s costume&#8221;. One older woman, who remembers the early days of CBC Television, simply said: &#8220;It never occurred to me that Maggie Muggins dress was coloured&#8221; (she had only ever seen the show in black and white).<br />
Although London is a smaller market for CBC Television, many of us felt we should have done a full show. We had enough people; we had great weather. The only thing we didn&#8217;t have was a great deal of space. Perhaps in hindsight, the partial event was a better idea.<br />
We did have enough space (and good weather) to lay out our tarps and tents on the platform to dry. The deluge in Windsor had left them all wet, and fairly dirty. As we wouldn&#8217;t raise all the tents again until Ottawa, we mopped them clean and let dry in the warm London sunshine. Bill S. took to swabbing the decks, so to speak. Not the sort of thing you see every day.<br />
I took a break partway through the day to do my photo run. This is when I&#8217;ll wander around the site or general area to take pictures of the event. Based on some information we&#8217;d received, I made a side trip to the Covenant Garden Market.<br />
The market is a new building, about three blocks from the train station. Inside are some wonderful stalls with fresh fruits and vegetables, delicatessen meats, cheeses of the world, and fragrant flowers. Without my own personal refrigerator, however, anything I purchased would go bad in a couple of days.<br />
By 4:00pm, the event started to slow down. The University of Western Ontario was hosting a football game that afternoon, and it probably drew a fair few people away. But that was fine with us &#8212; we had time to wrap up and pack things away. By 6:00, we were ready to leave.<br />
The trip back to Mimico was a fairly familiar one, having rode the GO Train more times than I can count. Once at Mimico, we detrained and departed either for home (for those who lived there) or to a hotel (for those of us far enough out of town, or out of province not to have a room to call home). We arrived late enough, and had an early enough start the following day, that I opted for a hotel room rather than stay the night with my family in Oakville.<br />
For the first time since we&#8217;d started on 4 September, we went our separate ways. It was an odd feeling, to say the least.</p>

Day 14<br />
So much for good weather. When I checked the weather forecast this morning, it said rain. That meant a slight different configuration in our New Media tent arrangement, and fewer people out to visit us.<br />
For the tent, two tables instead of four, six computers instead of nine, and no centre triangle. This would allow us room to let people into the tent to view the content if we had to roll the walls out when it rained.<br />
It&#8217;s a good thing we did, because it rained. A lot. Not all day, thankfully, but enough to make us a little damp. It also damped the spirits of our potential visitors. We ended up with fewer people out to see us. This was a blessing in two ways: less chance of long line-ups, and easier for us to interact with others.<br />
Most of the people I spoke to didn&#8217;t mind the rain &#8212; they liked it because it would keep the crowds away. They were ecstatic to see the museum (I have yet to meet anyone who didn&#8217;t like it), and were surprised to see all the other material we&#8217;d brought along with us. It makes me wish we could put out our full event at every stop.<br />
One other thing that helped a lot were our volunteers. We had a lot of them. They were all go-getters, willing to go that extra mile. One of the volunteers at the New Media tent, Mark, was also a local historian. While at lunch, Debbie strongly recommended that I talk with him. (I should mention that I love Debbie &#8212; she&#8217;s been watching out for me like a mom.)<br />
The VIA Rail station is not downtown Windsor &#8212; it&#8217;s in an area called Walkerville. Walkerville, in 1858, was the home of the Hiram Walker and Sons Distillery. It was a company town, with appointed mayors and officials. The town serviced the needs of its sole employer, the distillery. The company built row housing for employees, and mansions for its management. At the centre, against the banks of the St. Clair River, is the distillery.<br />
The neighbourhood still exists today, though it is decidedly more upscale than in its past. The row houses are well-kept, and probably well sought after. The larger houses are still here, too, including the large mansion built by Hiram&#8217;s sons. (Hiram himself lived in Detroit.)<br />
Shortly before our dinner break, my partner Debbie (like I said, she&#8217;s my Guardian Angel) got me the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes tour of the new VIA Renaissance equipment. Analisa tagged along when she heard that we&#8217;d be climbing into the locomotives. This was courtesy of John, our new train rider. (John took over for Peter when we got to Mimico.) Like Peter, John&#8217;s a train fanatic, which is why he still loves his job.<br />
John took Analisa and I first into #6403, the CBC F40PH-2. This was the same locomotive Peter had guided me through in Melville. After a brief stop, we climbed into the new P42. It&#8217;s like climbing into the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. I&#8217;m used to the valves, knobs, and gauges of steam locomotives. The computerized console of a P42 is something almost foreign to me. And I&#8217;m a member of the digerati!<br />
A standard VIA P42 diesel electric locomotive (which are almost the same as Amtrak P42s) has five computers to keep the unit running. If these crash, the locomotive doesn&#8217;t work. But you can control virtually any aspect of the locomotive, and record every last shred of information about the locomotive&#8217;s operation. I still prefer a firebox to a diesel engine.<br />
Then John took us through the Renaissance cars. These were originally European passenger cars built in England. When the order fell through, the cars remained undelivered. Transportation company GEC Alstom stepped in, bought the entire load, and then resold them to VIA. After some modifications to bring them to North American standards, VIA will put them into use in the Windsor-Montreal corridor, and on the Ocean train.<br />
The coach could be right out of a slightly more futuristic airplane. The seating, the layout &#8212; all you needed was a pair of wings out the windows, and you couldn&#8217;t really tell. The sleeper cars were significantly different, though. Many of the rooms (the deluxe rooms in particular) have showers, toilets, and sinks. It&#8217;s quite impressive. The space is small though, and I think they lack the charm and personality of the stainless steel Budd equipment that we&#8217;re using on our trip.<br />
Rain hit us hard a couple of times during the day, but rarely for more than 10 minutes. For most of the afternoon, it was relatively nice. Right up until we started to strike the sets, barely a minute after the computers had been loaded onto the train. I don&#8217;t think Noah had to content with that heavy a downpour.<br />
All of us got wet. Actually, &#8220;wet&#8221; isn&#8217;t quite right. &#8220;Thoroughly soaked to the bone&#8221; is a little more accurate. And &#8220;all&#8221; isn&#8217;t entirely correct, either. Some of us took shelter under partially collapsed tents. Some of us, including myself, didn&#8217;t care. We just plugged away at our job, just wishing that we had a bar of soap so we could make full use of the shower. The rain wasn&#8217;t too cold, so we didn&#8217;t freeze.<br />
Despite the weather, we managed to pack up in less than two hours. In fact, it took us less time to pack than it did for VIA to remarshall the train and depart. This should have driven us crazy, but merely annoyed us. The biggest problem was that the internal power had to be shut off while we waited. We watched the full length of &#8220;Shrek&#8221; in the Bullet Lounge of the Banff Park before power came back on (oh, the joys of battery-powered laptops).<br />
Next stop: London!</p>

Day 13<br />
Today was primarily a travel day. Awaking to the rising sun of the smog-filled sky of Toronto, I bade farewell to the VIA crew who had brought us from Winnipeg. It was time to welcome a new crew. Today, we also said goodbye to Jeannine and Peter, who return to Vancouver. (Peter, who has been sick for the last two days, has been uttering almost nothing but &#8220;home&#8221; since leaving Winnipeg.) We also gained a new person this morning: Trish, who&#8217;ll finally supply the support Cliff has desperately needed in Sports.<br />
We already miss our Vancouver crew terribly. They were great people, who enjoyed having fun as much as we do. Our newer crews seem a little more green, a little more by-the-books. Maybe in time we&#8217;ll be able to break them.<br />
During the night, VIA had attached a second train to ours &#8212; a new VIA Renaissance consist that we would tow from Toronto to Windsor and back, and all the way out to Quebec City. VIA is actively promoting these new trains, especially in the Southern Ontario / Southern Quebec corridor. At our next six stops, the VIA&#8217;s train will be promoted alongside ours.<br />
We departed VIA&#8217;s Toronto Maintenance Centre just after 9:00am. We backed up east of the Mimico GO station, and began our first trip west. For the next 20 minutes, we travelled along a rail line I knew well &#8212; CN&#8217;s Oakville subdivision. Living in Oakville most of my life, and having taken the GO Train for more years than I can remember, I knew the line quite well. It was a different experience seeing it from the dome of a VIA Skyline car.<br />
Richard Homme, the bassist from Frank Leahy&#8217;s band, was waiting in Oakville. Although we didn&#8217;t see him, he saw us. At least that&#8217;s what he told me in an email I got this evening. If nothing else, the fact that a well-known member of Canada&#8217;s musical and cultural scene will keep in touch with us is a sign of how well our team has worked.<br />
Leaving the Oakville Subdivision, we entered onto the Dundas Subdivision. I&#8217;ve never been out this far on a train, at least in memory. I vaguely remember a day when my mom, sister, and I travelled to London on VIA to visit with my father, who was working in London at the time. I remember nothing of the trip itself. To travel the distance again was not only gratifying, but helped restore a memory long forgotten.<br />
We zipped through London and entered the Chatham subdivision for Windsor. We thought we might arrive early &#8212; about 15:00. We thought we&#8217;d have lots of time for setting up and shuttling to the hotel (several of us were in desperate need to do laundry).<br />
How wrong we would be.<br />
My copy of the 2002 Canadian Trackside Guide doesn&#8217;t mention any sidings on the Chatham subdivision. In fact, there are a few. I know this because we sat in one for at least an hour. For no apparent reason. This had a few of our group a little agitated. But no more so than when we got to Windsor. Already running late according to our travel schedule, we were also pushing the limits of having the museum ready for its 18:30 show.<br />
Then the real grief began. We first had to wye the train (that&#8217;s railroadese for turning it around). Not too hard &#8212; there&#8217;s a wye about four kilometres from the station. That was easy. But those last four kilometres took forever to cross. The slow progress was making us lose our collective minds.<br />
Things got worse when we finally got close to the station. VIA detached the Renaissance consist, then backed our train in. (That&#8217;s actually the short version. VIA paid so much attention to their Renaissance train that sometimes I felt like we were being ignored.) We had hoped that we would be able to take our equipment off the coach car (also known as our office) before the rest of the train was moved to an inaccessible location. Next thing we knew, the front half of the train was pulling away.<br />
After managing to quickly pull the train back in to remove our equipment, we proceeded to start unloading for the shows. We have two in Windsor: one tonight for VIPs, and another tomorrow for the public. As soon as we had enough set up to open the museum, we started to pitch tents for tomorrow.<br />
We had hoped to set up tents, kiosks, and all the difficult stuff. We only got as far as tents. Rolling thunder and sheet lightning made us decide otherwise, and we packed it in after the tent flags were flapping in the stiffening wind. It rained torrentially on our way to the hotel.<br />
While most of the others went for dinner, Stefani and I opted for laundry. We were out of clean clothes (I had a pair of swim trunks and a sweatshirt left). The hotel had one washer and dryer. Why hotels have only one baffles me. The Vancouver hotel had three! It also means you spend a lot of time waiting, which was exactly what happened to me.<br />
Stefani beat me to the washing machine. No big deal &#8212; she offered to call me and let me know when she was going to remove her things so I could use it. True to her word, I got a phone call just as I hopped out of the shower. I hastily gathered my things and was just about to go out the door when the phone rang again. Some woman had decided that waiting in turn didn&#8217;t apply to her, and filled the washing machines with her shoes. I finally got in after the (rather odd) woman removed her runners and left. Cliff and Tracy started after me, and even popped in two more loonies when my jeans failed to dry completely.<br />
Tomorrow is the full public event. Our fingers are crossed for good weather and nice people. Though nice people would be enough.</p>
