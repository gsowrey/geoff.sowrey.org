	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was a hot night in Ottawa, following Stuart and Therese&#8217;s wedding. It was only going to get hotter. A lot hotter.<br />
The next day was 1 July, otherwise known as Canada Day. Otherwise known as the single biggest excuse to get horribly drunk and act like an idiot.<br />
Especially if you&#8217;re in Ottawa.<br />
My plans didn&#8217;t involve alcohol, though. They were much more simple: An outing with Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s family to see what could be found in our nation&#8217;s capital.<br />
My day started off, however, with a trip back out to Carp. This was for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Therese&#8217;s parents were holding a brunch / present opening for guests to the wedding.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d left my camera battery charger at the house.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brunch was perfect for the day I was about to face: Bagels, smoked salmon, and cream cheese (although I didn&#8217;t have any of that &#8212; cream cheese and I don&#8217;t get along for some reason). I took almost as many pictures of Therese and Stuart opening gifts as I had taken the day before. (The joys of copious amounts of storage in my camera.)<br />
Brunch ended fairly early, many people looking to driving back to whereever it was they came from, and others looking towards doing something for the rest of the day. For me, it was a return to Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s and prepare for the rest of the day&#8217;s events roaming around downtown Ottawa.<br />
By the time I got back to the house, the temperature was already well into the 30s, and showed little sign of slowing down. From all the reports I heard on the radio, this was going to be a VERY hot day. (The next day, the radio joked that the temperature had gone to 216 degrees, or 36 without the humidex. In either case, it was just an inhumane (and generally unfriendly to animals, too) temperature for people to be out doing anything strenuous, which was exactly what about 300,000+ people were doing in the downtown/Hull area.)<br />
We parked in a lot to the southwest of Parliment Hill, from which we hoped to be able to make a quick escape after the fireworks were over. (Hey, you can at least hope.) And with that, we jumped from the air-conditioned truck into the sweltering heat of Canada Day.<br />
Wandering, albeit a little more slowly, we eventually found our way down to Wellington/Rideau, which had been cordoned off for pedestrian use. It was almost 2pm, and the larger shows wouldn&#8217;t start for a few hours, but already the streets were lined with revellers. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen so much red and white in my life.<br />
And that was just the pastey white folk with the sunburns.<br />
We made it down about as far as the Chateau Laurier when we ran into the first major busker, who was going to attempt a rope walk on a portable rope-walking apparatus. The guy&#8217;s show was nearly completely based on the lead-up. The actual rope walk was completely anti-climactic, but a good showman will always leave people entertained. Barely into his show, he was tapped on the shoulder by a woman who asked him (he had a loudspeaker) to ask if there was a doctor in the audience &#8212; a young girl had passed out in the heat.<br />
Yes, it was that hot. I guess I needn&#8217;t mention the thick layer of sunscreen protecting us (most of us, anyway, Stefan doesn&#8217;t like the stuff).<br />
Now quite damp from the steady stream of sweat (and the show over), we started hunting around for the next great thing to see. As it happens, we passed the Photography Gallery (adjacent to the Chateau Laurier). At first, we weren&#8217;t going to go in, but the guard had quite the draw:<br />
&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen! Please take advantage of your nation&#8217;s free and *air-conditioned* museums this Canada Day!&#8221;<br />
The museum was small, pretty empty on the upper level, but much cooler. We took our time before running back outside.<br />
We headed into Majors Hill Park to see what interesting things could be found. The first was a welcome relief to everyone suffering in the great outdoor furnace: a Spray Zone. This is nothing fancy, no more than a hose hooked into the city water supply and bent into a two metre arch. Anyone walking under the spray got quite wet &#8212; which was perfect for us. We nearly took permanent refuge under there.<br />
Barely into the park, Rebecca pretty much insisted that I get some water before I started keeling over from dehydration and sunstroke. Unable to drink from the two camelback water pouches they brought (although offered, I declined due to nursing a mild cold), I purchased a pair of bottles from a vendor. There weren&#8217;t too expensive, and would keep me relatively well hydrated for the day.<br />
Eric took the opportunity to refill his now nearly empty water gun with the ice-cold water. Eric had probably brought it along as a joke, trying to annoy everyone else. However, it kind of backfired on him when we continually asked him to hose us down so we could try and keep cool. Although it was a fair bit of fun when Stefan managed to periodically steal the pistol and turn the tables on the lad.<br />
But Eric wasn&#8217;t the only one with a water gun. Shortly after one of the various busker shows, we walked into the cross-fire of a man slinging what can only be described as a water bazooka. I think the stream was about an inch in diametre. Rebecca got shot square in the face, but didn&#8217;t seem to mind one bit.<br />
The park area was filled with various little booths and shows (including an extreme sports aerial demonstration), and lots of people. Onward we trudged, watching the various buskers (none of whom were particularly interesting), before finding ourselves getting on a shuttle bus for Hull.<br />
The &#8220;National Captial Region&#8221; is not just the Ontario side. It includes Hull as well, so naturally, there were events on the other side. Of particular importance was the children&#8217;s area, complete with play areas, air-filled bounce rooms, and L&#8217;Ecole du Cirque, who set up a pair of trampolines, a pair of trapezes, and some other circus-related equipment so children of all ages could enjoy themselves.<br />
In the oppressive heat.<br />
Eric and Thea (Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s kids) made full use of the facilities, as did Stefan when he tried to ride a unicycle. He wasn&#8217;t horribly successful, but did learn that it made for a great upper thigh exercise trying to stay balanced.<br />
After the kids had run the course of the circus, we started heading back. Or rather, we would have were it not for curiousity, which drew us over to the Museum of Civilization. As nothing was immediately visible, we headed back over the bridge (sans autobus) to the Ottawa side. We took our time over the middle, as the breeze there was cooling enough to make the trip bearable.<br />
As we started to cross the bridge, Eric announced, to our partial dismay, that the water gun was broken. The pump used to pressurize the vessel had apparently blown a seal. Had Stefan a screwdriver, it would have been fixed in a jiffy. But with only his wits and a pocket of keys, cracking the gun open for repairs was outside of his ability. We would be waterless for the rest of the day.<br />
Once reaching the other side, we found that the pathway down to the Rideau Canal and locks was blocked off for &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. Probably meant they didn&#8217;t want to worry about some yutz getting too close to the fireworks. Within a few steps, however, the heat had become unbearable. We needed to cool off.<br />
Despite objections from the kids, we ducked into the National Art Gallery. Almost instantly, we felt our sanity returning as the cool air slowly stripped away the veneer of heat-spawned exhaustion. It took nearly 45 minutes before we were ready to brave the great outdoors again. Our brave, energized burst outdoors came to a slow crawl within five metres of the door, as the oven-like air burned off our veneer of cool-enduced enthusiasm<br />
We wandered back through Majors Hill Park and climbed the stairs back to Wellington St. The stairwell was completely covered in chalk drawings from someone who had left large pieces of street chalk all over the place. Thea grabbed a piece, and from the Chateau Laurier, across Wellington, down the stairs at the NAC, down the sidewalk next to the Canal, and all the way into Confederation Park, Thea would walk about five feet, stoop down and draw a happy face.<br />
Had I not managed to sort out my differences with the RCMP and CSIS earlier in the day, I would have been an easy person to follow.<br />
Confederation Park was the location of interesting food &#8230; well, more interesting than the plethora of hotdogs and sausages available about every 10 metres along most of the roads. Here was Egyptian, Japanese (sorry, but as much as I love sushi, there are things I will not touch in that heat), Indian, and something else I can&#8217;t remember now. I ended up having (rather spicy) butter chicken and a samosa (love those things). I almost got lucky and had myself dunked in ice-cold water when the clerk at the counter emptied out their pop bucket. Had I been actually thinking, I would have shoved my head under the stream &#8230; all I got was my foot.<br />
We sat in the shade of a large tree and tried to relax. Even with a setting sun, the heat was still intense. We opted to wait for Reggae Cowboys to start, hoping that they&#8217;d be at least somewhat entertaining. (They were at best tolerable.) The real stars of the stage were Samba Ottawa, a band what would be quite at home at Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Despite being almost entirely white folk, they played a mean beat that had everyone tapping something. Admittedly, though, I ended up watching a young woman (early 20s, I imagine), who had curves like an hourglass and rhythm that could kill. The fact that she was uber-cute certainly added to the appeal. For a short time, I forgot how hot it was.<br />
I dunno what it is about people of Spanish or Portugese decent, but they really know how to mambo&#8230;<br />
Extracating ourselves from the park around 8:15, we found our way to Parliment Hill, and forced our way into the crowd. Stefan and I held back a bit while Rebecca and the kids moved ahead into a small clear spot. But we could all see just fine.<br />
The show was basically four bands: The Arrogant Worms (who did double duty as emcees), two French bands, and David Usher (formerly of Moist). The Worms played their songs in between the sets of the other bands, including their biggest pro-national hits, &#8220;Rocks and Trees&#8221; (really quite humourous in a large crowd setting), and &#8220;Canada&#8217;s Really Big&#8221;.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what it is with French bands, but they always seem to have guys who look as old as the Rolling Stones, or play the same song five times over. Okay, maybe I can&#8217;t hear French language as well as I should (damn the public school system!), but even musically it&#8217;s not too hard to VARY A NOTE OR TWO. And the singer in one band made Leonard Cohen look like a vocal genius.<br />
And I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of David Usher. I&#8217;ve heard his songs, they&#8217;re okay, but they really don&#8217;t rock my boat. But hey, it&#8217;s a free live show, and I wasn&#8217;t about to complain. And admittedly, he put on a good show. And I do have to say, he knows how to end it.<br />
The last song of the night was announced this way:<br />
&#8220;Wow! You&#8217;re a great audience! [Crowd cheers loudly.] But every good party needs a little Ozzy!&#8221;<br />
Yes, Ozzy as in Ozzy Osbourne. Sure enough, his band started playing the beginning to &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Ozzy, either. I like a couple of his songs, but I&#8217;ll be unable to name &#8217;em. Usher managed to mix the music scores from two Ozzy songs, and then overlaid different lyrics, specifically &#8220;Get This Party Started&#8221; by Pink.<br />
Sounds weird, I know, but wouldn&#8217;t ya know it &#8212; they go together really well. (Expect it on Dave&#8217;s next album.)<br />
Following that were the ubiquitous fireworks, a requirement of every Canada Day celebration. Had we been on the Quebec side of the river, I suspect the fireworks would have been amazing. On the south side of the Parliment Buildings, however, they ain&#8217;t so hot &#8212; we could only really see the high ones.<br />
Fireworks over, the five of us stalled a bit while the rest of the crowd of probably 500,000+ filtered out into the night. We took our time, found a stall with sausages (we were pretty hungry), and eventually found the car. Getting out of the downtown, however, was another story.<br />
Traffic, as one might expect, as a disaster. The police had blocked off certain roads that Stefan wanted to take so we could make a quick escape. This, suffice to say, frustrated him immensely. But it ended up directing us over to Marnie&#8217;s apartment (a friend of Stefan and Rebecca) who accompanied us on our trip back to Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s house. There we took refuge in the cool basement to relax a little.<br />
The next morning, following a quick visit to the National Museum of Science and Technology (I wanted to get pictures of the locomotives they have there), I braved the trip back to Toronto, at fairly high speed. I wasn&#8217;t keen on getting caught in traffic.<br />
It was hot.<br />
Really hot.<br />
And to top it all off, I got a sunburn.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in your life when things start getting a lot more adult than you&#8217;re normally used to. For me, it was when my friends started getting married. But I didn&#8217;t really start getting self-conscious about it until this past weekend.<br />
On 30 June 2002, I had the honour of attending the wedding of two of my closest and dearest friends, Stuart and Therese. (They were marrying each other. Added bonus: I only had to buy one gift.)<br />
Although Therese and Stuart currently live in Calgary, the majority of their family lives in Ontario. The entire affair was held at Therese&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house in Carp, about a 25 km drive from downtown Ottawa. It would mean, for me, a trip back east, back to Ottawa for (another) summer wedding, and a chance to meet with old friends.<br />
I flew out on the 28th, flying to Hamilton via WestJet. (I&#8217;ve formally sworn off Tango &#8212; they might have cheaper fares than WestJet, but their total lack of service is enough to keep me going to WestJet. And I ain&#8217;t the only one.) Arriving late, I had to catch a cab to my mom&#8217;s house in Oakville. It&#8217;s not exactly a cheap cab ride.<br />
But stay in Oakville I didn&#8217;t &#8212; the next morning, after rising, showering, and running a couple of errands, I headed out to Ottawa. It had been five and a half years since I drove to Ottawa, and I was actually looking forward to the trip. (Or I would have, if the stupid tape deck in the car had accepted the cassette adapter so I could play my MiniDisc through the radio.) But all in all, it could have been worse &#8230; the radio could have been broken.<br />
I left Oakville almost an hour and a half late. And I paid for that delay, too. Although I shot down the QEW, the Gardner Expressway, and up the DVP without trouble, I had forgotten the cardinal rule of long weekends in Southern Ontario:<br />
Leave early, or sit in traffic.<br />
I got partway into Scarborough when my blunder came to fruition. Hard traffic. Really hard. And it lasted all the way out to Whitby. A drive that would normally take about 30 minutes took well over two hours.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take much to remind me of the reasons I no longer like Southern Ontario, especially in the summer. Topmost on my list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Traffic (especially rush hour or long weekend)</li>
<li>Heat (especially when combined with humidity)</li>
<li>Smell (especially when stuck in traffic when it&#8217;s really hot)</li>
</ol>
<p>Traffic didn&#8217;t really clear up until almost Kingston. Needless to say, I found out that Dad&#8217;s Chevy Cavalier can do 130 km/h without difficulty at all.<br />
Not having driven in Ottawa since about 1996, I had never taken the 416 before. This was a vast improvement on the old Highway 16, which was a deathtrap in winter, and just took too long the rest of the time. My speed barely slowing, I found myself in Ottawa in about the same amount of time it would have taken me on Highway 7, and without hitting traffic.<br />
Unlike the majority of others, I would not check into a hotel during my stay. Instead, I was invited to stay with my friends Stefan and Rebecca. As I would not be hanging out with Stuart and Therese the entire time, this was a chance for me to catch up with them, and hopefully have some fun.<br />
I soon found that my memory of their house&#8217;s location was a little off, and I ended up having to call for directions. Fortunately, I wasn&#8217;t too far off, so it only took a couple of minutes to show up. (Now I know exactly where the house is.)<br />
Rebecca was there (Stefan was off getting supplies to begin home renovations), so we chatted a while before everyone else came home. Deciding that the sticky heat of an early Ottawa summer was not exactly comfortable, we decided that maybe air-conditioned entertainment was more appropriate. It was movie time&#8230;<br />
Ottawa, like many other cities in Canada, is suffering from movie theatre overload. Theatres that were considered luxurious only a few years ago are now waning, becoming second-run &#8220;cheapie&#8221; theatres. (Oakville doesn&#8217;t even have a Famous Players or Cineplex anymore &#8212; only AMC exists in town, and only on the very east end.) The theatre we were in will be a cheapie in the next six months, we guessed.<br />
Although Minority Report is an excellent film, the lack of air conditioning in the theatre didn&#8217;t make the movie any better. In fact, we couldn&#8217;t wait to get out of the movie so we could cool down after a while. I just made a point of not moving during the 2.5+ hour show.<br />
The movie over, Rebecca, Stefan, and I opted to retreat to the relative wildness of the Bytown Market, the favoured hangout of the young and reckless. During the school year, this is where you can find the majority of post-secondary students in the National Capital Region. During the summer &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t really know where they all come from, but there&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em.<br />
We wandered around, trying to find a place that had nice margaritas and not too long a lineup. It took us a while, but eventually we found the right place. But by then, it was nearly closing time. So we downed what we had, and made way for home.<br />
The next day was the Big Day. But it wouldn&#8217;t start for me until 3:30 that afternoon. We started the morning with breakfast at a nearby restaurant. Then it was a leisurely return home, a long shower, and a very careful dressing. (Although I had to borrow one of Stefan&#8217;s undershirts to prevent nasty perspiration stains from finding their way to my shirt.)<br />
Did I mention that it was borderline insanely hot?<br />
Ottawa, like Southern Ontario, gets very warm in the summer. The temperature was in the low 30s, which in itself is quite warm. However, on top of that is the humidity, which cranks the perceived temperature to something like 45. (This is all Celsius, by the way.)<br />
The trip out to Carp was a relatively easy one, even though I hadn&#8217;t been there for at least six years &#8212; probably longer. Luckily, I remembered something about the Crazy Horse Saloon, which marked where I had to turn. After that, it was just a matter of finding the right house. It wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; there was only one wedding on the street that day.<br />
The Holton household was a flurry of activity, and I was one of the first to show. (Actually, I was asked by Therese and Stuart to arrive a little early. I had certain duties they wanted me to fulfill.) Therese was not quite at the panic stage yet, and seemed to be handling everything very well. Mrs. Holton seemed quite well off, as did Mr. Holton. Danica (Therese&#8217;s sister) was completely at ease. Stuart, who was roaming about, seemed a little nervous, but had planned everything out so well that he seemed barely fazed by the whole event to come.<br />
Before long, the guests started appearing in droves. Some people, such as Stuart&#8217;s parents, I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. Others, such as Jay, Matt, and Nabil, I had seen more recently, coincidentally at another wedding (Jay&#8217;s, to be specific). Then there were people from Guelph (where Therese when to university) that I hadn&#8217;t seen in almost six years. And then&#8230; well, the list is fairly lengthy. Suffice to say, it was good to see all.<br />
I took my place in the front row of the guest seats, where I could get a good view of the ceremony. Stuart and Therese trusted me to take some of the key photos (I really hope they turn out), so I had to be in a place where I could see them. I also had to cue the music at the right times, and still try to look like I was just a guest. Juggling two cameras ain&#8217;t easy, especially when you don&#8217;t have the luxury of telling people not to move.<br />
The sound of bagpipes soon wafted through the trees and under the tents &#8212; Stuart walked through the garden path, up the aisle, and to his place on the deck. After a few moments, the tune changed (and no, not to &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; &#8212; although that would have been rather interesting on the bagpipes), and Therese walked her way up to take her place next to Stuart.<br />
Then came the moment that 10 years ago I dreaded, that for the last four years have been expecting, and for the last six months, had truly hoped would be their happiest day. The ceremony began.<br />
Stuart was dressed in his fine kilt (his family is Scottish), but donned a lavender-blue button-down shirt with a matching silk tie. Therese&#8217;s dress was a matte silver silk with spaghetti string straps. Her hair was up (a rarity for her), with a small tiara to tie it all together. Although the tiara had been a bit of a joke when she first acquired it, when Therese walked up onto the deck, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of Audrey Hepburn in &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8221;. It had been a very long time since the last time, but I was envious of Stuart.<br />
The feeling passed quickly, though, and I was swept into the affair. It was simple, quiet, and exactly what I&#8217;d expect from Therese and Stuart &#8212; complete with a bit of humour when Therese stumbled across one of her lines, and teary when Therese had trouble getting another out through her half-sobs of joy. This was truly a happy day.<br />
The ceremony was short, but sweeter than the most luxurious sugar. Okay, yeah, that sounds cheesy, but you gotta understand &#8212; this is the first wedding I actually cried at. Until then, I didn&#8217;t really get the joke: &#8220;I always cry at weddings.&#8221;<br />
The vows were exchanged, as were rings, and before we knew it, came the kiss. I was so overwhelmed with everything that I almost forgot the music cue.<br />
Therese and Stuart adjourned to a small table to sign away their lives, so to speak. Pictures were taken in spades. The Music Gods smiled on Stuart and Therese that day &#8212; the first song in the queue (Tom Petty&#8217;s &#8220;Wildflowers&#8221; finished just as they returned to centre stage, to be pronounced (offically) husband and wife. As they left, I skipped to the fifth song, the one they wanted to play as they finished and left the stage, The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;All You Need Is Love&#8221;.<br />
The crowd moved to the front yard, where the majority of the &#8220;formal&#8221; photographs were taken. There was no professional photographer, Therese and Stuart were relying on the rest of us shutterbugs to get the photographs. I was entrusted a little further with Stuart&#8217;s manual camera (which, thankfully, he&#8217;d already preset for use) &#8212; I only pray that the pictures I took meet with his approval.<br />
Pictures wrapped up, the party slowly began as people started to filter over to the tent again (a group of us had moved the chairs around and put up tables during the picture session &#8212; I was supposed to coordinate it, but I got caught up in the photos). Drinks came out (well, they&#8217;d been out for a while, but they came out a bit faster now), and people started mingling.<br />
While people mingled, we had one problem to solve. In all our haste, we had forgotten the head table. There wasn&#8217;t one. But luckily, there were enough people to solve the problem &#8212; two small tables could seat eight, and suddenly everyone was happy again.<br />
By the time table started in to get their meals, we had to start lighting the citronella lamps to try and cut down on the armada of mosquitos that were started to thin out the available blood supply.<br />
Dinner was wonderfully simple: Salads, poached salmon, and a hot buffet that included roast beef. It successfully covered everyone&#8217;s tastes and desires &#8230; especially those of us who love a variety.<br />
Dinner completed, people began to mingle again. Slowly at first, some moving into the house to escape the invasion of airborne bloodsuckers, others taking their leave and heading home (or to their respective hotels). Dancing was informal, and not really long-lived. Although the constant movement kept the mosquitos at bay a little better, not everyone was completely comfortable in the unbearable heat. (Even afer the sun went down, it was still quite warm.)<br />
People began to dissipate like steam from a kettle over the next couple of hours. I was one of the last to leave. I returned to my car, and headed back towards Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s.<br />
As I drove in the cool(er) silence of the night, I thought about the day&#8217;s proceedings. Yes, things had changed. Stuart and Therese were no longer just friends, or partners, or significant others. They, like many of my friends, were now married. Life was again moving forward, in its inexorable march forward. And while I was so happy that their wedding had been a joyous one, there was that slightly ominous undertone of the finality of life, that this is an event that I will witness but once.<br />
But that&#8217;s why I take pictures, so I can relive the moment any time I want. And it&#8217;s why I write these journals, so I can also remember my thoughts and feelings.<br />
Congratulations, my dear friends. May your marriage bring you joy, prosperity, and the sound of little feet.<br />
And I ain&#8217;t referring to your cats.</p>
