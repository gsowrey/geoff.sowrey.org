	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m a closet watch geek. Sort of like a closet Trekkie, but without the tendency for pointy ears. I&#8217;ve been one for years. I&#8217;ve had countless watches, including radio watches, pocket watches (I&#8217;ve got seven), dress watches (mostly cheap crap, admittedly), a couple of designer watches, Russian watch (sadly broken), and numerous cheapies (which have been both good and bad to me).<br />
Currently, I have two watches (not counting the pocket watches) that I could wear. One is a six-odd year old Kenneth Cole. I bought it mostly because I needed a good watch (for a change) and I liked the colour. Well, the colour started rubbing off and when the battery gave out, moisture got into the interior and <strong><em>pfbbbbbt!</em></strong>, the whole thing went out of commission. I&#8217;ll get it fixed eventually, I suppose. Especially since it cost me over $100.<br />
<span id="more-607"></span>For the record, this is <em>big</em> money for my watch habit. Anything I wear is usually cheap. Such as my other (and only working) watch, a Walmart special Dickies &#8220;brand&#8221; quartz. I bought it just before going to Europe because I needed something that would actually tell time (my CDMA cellphone &#8212; my most reliable timepiece &#8212; won&#8217;t work in Europe).<br />
My problem is that I&#8217;ve realized that there are much better watches out there, and darn it, I need to seriously think about buying a proper watch, not some dumpy one.<br />
I know this mostly because of my job. Right now, I&#8217;m the Technology Director on the Rolex account. Yes, that <a href="http://www.rolex.com/">Rolex</a>. Through the last few months, I&#8217;ve been poking around in the competition websites to see what they&#8217;ve done. Not for the watches but for the technology of the websites. Problem: You can&#8217;t really help but notice the watches. Especially if you&#8217;re a watch geek.<br />
Now I don&#8217;t jump at just any watch. That&#8217;s too easy. I like something nice, even unique. And I don&#8217;t really go for the flashy, either &#8212; no bling, please. I like simple, understated. That&#8217;s just the style, though. Over the last few months, I&#8217;ve also come to appreciate craftsmanship, technology, assembly, and durability. Something you won&#8217;t get from Walmart.<br />
Oh, and I must be analog. No digital. I hate digital. I quote Douglas Adams:</p>
<blockquote><p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-eight million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea&#8230;<br />
<cite>&#8211;Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been looking a long time. To give you an idea of what I&#8217;ve been looking at, allow me to take you on a short tour of some of my favourites in my travels. I present these to you in no particular order.<br />
First off is, believe it or not, <a href="http://www.citizenwatch.com/">Citizen</a>. Yes, the Citizen of Japanese cheap-end quartz watch fame. Funny thing about the Japanese watch market: they dump all the cheap crap on us and save the best stuff for themselves. (Can&#8217;t say I blame &#8217;em, though.) Just because Seiko invented the quartz movement in the late 1960s and nearly wiped out the Swiss watch market doesn&#8217;t mean that they haven&#8217;t learned a few things from the Swiss.<br />
Enter the <a href="http://citizen.jp/campanola/">Campanola Perpetual Calendar</a>. If you had shown this to me on the street, I&#8217;d have thought it something like a fake Rolex. How could Citizen make something this neat? And yes, it&#8217;s also crazy expensive, running $2,500. (Incidentally, all prices I mention will be in $CDN &#8212; I am Canadian, after all.)<br />
Mind you, I have my doubts that I could even get this watch in Canada if I wanted it. Citizen and Seiko alike don&#8217;t export their higher-end models readily.<br />
Also from Citizen is the Eco-Drive series, a pretty neat idea. Although quartz, it takes its power from a solar cell embedded in the watch face. So long as you wear the watch outdoors, it stores electricity and keeps running. Of these, I happen to like the <a href="http://www.citizenwatch.com/COC/English/detail.asp?Country=COC&amp;Language=English&amp;ModelNumber=BJ7020-55E">Nighthawk titanium</a> &#8212; a massively oversized (47mm face) beast that includes, of all things, a slide rule for calculating fuel usage. Obviously, it was designed for pilots. Cost? Around $700.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s slide over to Citizen&#8217;s cousin, <a href="http://www.seikocan.com/">Seiko</a>. Although the inventor of the quartz movement, Seiko&#8217;s continued to develop the idea into new and better versions. Take the <a href="http://www.seikocan.com/seiko/en/product.asp?id=1199">Seiko Kinetic Perpetual</a>, for example. This funky little thing is part mechanical, part electronic. It has a little battery charged by the kinetic movement of your arm. If you stop moving for a day, so does the watch. Or rather the hands &#8212; the watch itself keeps ticking and knows exactly what time and date it is. Start moving it and it automatically adjusts the face. That&#8217;s slick. List is about $1,000, but I&#8217;ve seen discounts for almost half that.<br />
Seiko also continued the pure mechanical development with their <a href="http://www.seiko-watch.co.jp/gs/">Grand Seiko</a>. This is the creme de la creme of Seiko, and it goes for the price of a comparable Swiss watch. From what I&#8217;ve read, it&#8217;s a piece of art, not only on the outside but also the inside. The catch, aside from price, is the ticket to Japan you&#8217;ll need to buy one.<br />
Then Sean, our product specialist, turns me to the <a href="http://www.seikospringdrive.com/">Seiko Spring Drive</a>. Two comments. First &#8212; Seiko, you guys really need to get your act together and merge all your watch lines into a single website. I keep tripping over them like toys scattered about the floor. Second, there really needs to be a dealer in town who sells these, &#8216;cuz I really want to see one. I think no matter what happens, I&#8217;ll probably own a Seiko in a few years.<br />
Let&#8217;s scoot out of the Japanese market to the &#8220;typical&#8221; high-end manufacturers. First to <a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/">Tag Heuer</a>, the Nike of the luxury watch market. These guys really like to focus on watches meant more for action than for show. So naturally, it would be one that I&#8217;d like to look at.<br />
And one I really like to look at is the <a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/the-collection/monaco/automatic-chronograph/index.lbl?w=CW2113.FC6183">Tag Heuer Monaco Automatic Chronograph</a> &#8212; especially the Steve McQueen edition (about $2,300). It&#8217;s sporty, elegant, and the blue face is trés nice. But I don&#8217;t hold the same for their entire line. Some are very nice (the <a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/the-collection/carrera/automatic-watch/index.lbl?w=WV2115.FC6182">Carerra</a>, for example). But the <a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/the-collection/tag-heuer-formula-1/index.lbl?lang=en">Formula 1</a> looks like something from Timex with all of that kvetchy colour and the blocky bezel.<br />
And I have to say, there&#8217;s something oddly cheap about a rubber wristband on a high-end watch. I see where Tag Heuer is coming from, but I don&#8217;t think I could ever do it.<br />
Oh, and luxury brands that make any form of a digital watch, no matter how &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be considered luxury. But that&#8217;s just me. Ew.<br />
Years ago, James Bond wore Rolex. Now he wears <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/">Omega</a>. Omega is, in my mind, the nearest competitor to Rolex in terms of product lines, associations (Omega is the official timekeeper of the Olympic Games; Rolex timekeeps for a host of events like Wimbledon), and style.<br />
So naturally, I&#8217;m drawn to some of the Omega line. I like the Seamaster line, particularly the <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/index.php?id=286&amp;details=1&amp;ref=22208000&amp;no_cache=1">300M Chronometer</a> (even though I don&#8217;t need a diving watch). The <a href="http://www.omegawatches.com/index.php?id=303&amp;details=1&amp;ref=35693100&amp;no_cache=1">Speedmaster Professional</a> also turns my head (except that it&#8217;s a manual wind, which I don&#8217;t like). The range is $2,600 to $2,800.<br />
An interesting thing I came across during my research. Apparently <a href="http://www.movado.com/">Movado</a> is considered &#8220;luxury&#8221;. I mean, who buys these, really?<br />
One of the really avante garde watches out there is <a href="http://www.bellross.com/">Bell &amp; Ross</a>. Take the clock out of an airplane instrument panel, put a band on it, and sell it as a watch. That&#8217;s their BR 01 series. Funky. But I don&#8217;t think I could make that one work. Besides, I&#8217;m sure $2,900 could be put to other uses.<br />
While we&#8217;re on the pilot vein, I should mention that I like many of the <a href="http://www.iwc.com/">IWC</a> watches, which have a wonderful, elegant style without getting gaudy (like <a href="http://www.gucci.com/">Gucci</a>&#8216;s). In particular is the <a href="http://www.iwc.com/collection/collection_detail.asp?l=en&amp;mid=208">Portuguese</a>. Until I saw the sticker price. My car doesn&#8217;t cost that much.<br />
<a href="http://www.franckmullerusa.com/">Franck Muller</a> makes some of the most amazing-looking watches I&#8217;ve seen. They&#8217;re gorgeous. And the man (yes, Virginia, there really is a Franck Muller) is a genius. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complication_%28horology%29">complications</a> he comes up with are astounding. He even made a three-axis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon">tourbillon</a> &#8212; I&#8217;d love to see that in action! These suckers start at about $5,200 and go up quickly.<br />
<a href="http://www.cartier.com/">Cartier</a>. Nice. And that&#8217;s about it. But more about looks than function.<br />
<a href="http://www.vacheron-constantin.com/">Vacheron Constantin</a> makes a nice watch, too (even some sub-$1,000 models). But maybe it&#8217;s just me, but for a bit of texturing on the bands and faceplate, it seems like a bit much for the watches the offer. Chances are I&#8217;m missing something here.<br />
<a href="http://www.hamiltonwatch.com/">Hamilton</a> is known to me for pocket watches, which they still make. (Yes, it&#8217;s a train thing.) I have to admit that I quite like several of the watches in their line, having been long ago attracted to the Ventura line (starting at about $630) &#8212; you might remember those as the iconic watches from &#8220;<em>Men In Black</em>&#8220;. But that&#8217;s about as far as it goes, and I doubt I&#8217;d go any further.<br />
Alright, very fine Geoff, you&#8217;ve mentioned about half the watches in existence. So what do you want?<br />
It&#8217;s going to sound like I&#8217;m trying to say the right thing (also known as &#8220;sucking up&#8221;), but I have to say that I&#8217;m leaning very hard towards Rolex.<br />
Now before you leap all over me, there&#8217;s a reason why. In fact, several. I know how they&#8217;re made now. I know the level of tolerances that are allowed (and let me tell you, if it&#8217;s not perfect, it&#8217;s not shipped). Unlike almost every watch out there, Rolexes are (in most of their lines) waterproof, not just water resistant. (The <a href="http://www.rolex.com/en/collection/rolex-gallery/sea-dweller/">Sea-Dweller</a>, for example, is waterproof to over 1,200 metres.)<br />
Personally, my favourite testimonial for a Rolex comes from a very unlikely source. Hunt through Google, looking for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=che+guevara+rolex&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">che guevara rolex</a>&#8220;, and you&#8217;ll find a lot of entries about how Cuba &#8212; an emerging Communist nation &#8212; allowed one of its premiere citizens to bear a luxury capitalist item. But that&#8217;s not why he owned it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Che knew why he wore a Rolex. After all, a man whose whereabouts were often unknown for months at a time, even to close friends like Fidel Castro, needed a wristwatch that was sturdy, self-winding, water-resistant, and easily legible. In short, a watch that could take whatever the jungle dished out and not miss a beat.<br />
<cite>&#8212; WatchTime, December 2003, &#8220;Old School, New Rules&#8221;</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m no communist revolutionary, but I want a Rolex.<br />
I&#8217;m torn between a couple of models: the <a href="http://www.rolex.com/en/collection/extraordinary-watches/datejust/index.jsp">Oyster Perpetual DateJust</a>, the <a href="http://www.rolex.com/en/collection/extraordinary-watches/explorer/index.jsp">Oyster Perpetual Explorer II</a>, and the <a href="http://www.rolex.com/en/collection/extraordinary-watches/submariner/index.jsp">Oyster Perpetual Submariner</a> (the original James Bond watch). I&#8217;m sure I can figure that out though.<br />
The hard part will be finding a way to pony up the $4,400 to $6,400 needed. That&#8217;s gonna be a tough sell to say the least.<br />
I&#8217;d better start saving my allowance.</p>
