		<p>2004 wasn&#8217;t exactly what I&#8217;d call a tumultuous year, but it was certainly marked with some pretty big events for me, not the least of which was meeting Alex. If there was a number one in the list, she would be it. 2005 is already looking to be an interesting year, since there are a lot of things that will be happening for me. It&#8217;s not going to be an easy year, but if we always had easy years, we&#8217;d never feel a sense of accomplishment.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> <em>The following entry contains language that might not be appropriate to some. If you are offended easily by some words, I recommend skipping this entry. If you continue to read it, and are offended, your damn funeral!</em><br />
I&#8217;ve listened to George Carlin since I was a beginning teenager. Back then, he was the funniest thing I&#8217;d ever heard. Guess what? He still is.<br />
Tonight, George Carlin came to Calgary, and played the Jack Singer Hall. He certainly has a way of attracting a large crowd. There were exceedingly few empty seats, which just shows his drawing power.<br />
George started out in comedy in the 1950s as a clean cut, well-dressed comedian. He had a show that played well, and was attended by the well to-do of the time. After a while, however, that didn&#8217;t really sit with him. It wasn&#8217;t his thing. He was playing to his parents, not his generation.<br />
This is how he came up with the Seven Words You Can&#8217;t Say On Television: shit, piss, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.<br />
(Offended yet?)<br />
This is what sent George down a significantly different road than most comics at the time. In some ways, he could be thought of as an original &#8220;bad guy&#8221; of comedy. He forever stepped away from the good side, and made sure that the boat would never stop rocking.<br />
George is an observationalist. That&#8217;s what makes him so funny. He doesn&#8217;t invent stories, he doesn&#8217;t create one-liners. He tells you the things you already know, but maybe just haven&#8217;t thought of it that way before.<br />
Take enemas, for example. Not the most pleasant of topics, are they? Well, consider this: you know what they are, you might even know someone who&#8217;s had one. But someone, probably a guy (according to Carlin), thought of it first. Imagine that moment.<br />
George started off his session with a rapid-fire monologue of what he is. I can&#8217;t even begin to describe it, let alone repeat it, and do it any remote point of justice. It was, however, amazing.<br />
He then commented on how he was preparing for his 13th HBO special, and had a few things that he needed to rearrange to make the show be zippy. It was almost like hearing your grandfather (Carlin is 67, by the way) natter away about something very trivial. I was worried. I was thinking that this might end up being a really lousy show&#8230;<br />
&#8220;You know what people don&#8217;t talk about in public anymore? Pussy farts!&#8221;<br />
George Carlin had officially entered the room. So began about a 90 minute barrage of swearing, unusual musings, several slanders against every race, sex, creed, religion, and belief (because, like I said, George loves rocking that boat), with barely a pause. He didn&#8217;t waste time, and despite a couple of low points, he got a lot of laughs.<br />
There were no encores, no curtain calls. He&#8217;s a simple guy who loves to turn the world on its ear for 90 minutes at a time. And that&#8217;s why people love to listen to George Carlin rant. Before there was Dennis Leary, before Eddie Murphy, before Father Guido Sarducci, there was Carlin.<br />
So to you George, thank you. Thank you for coming to Calgary and bringing us a live rendition of your views for us to hear. Thank you for being so blunt about the way things are, good or bad.<br />
And of course, thank you for fucking me up 20 years ago.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s just something inherently wrong with watching Stanley Cup hockey while sweating because it&#8217;s so warm. The season needs to be shorter.<br />
Or there need to be fewer teams, especially in places where you can&#8217;t naturally have ice outside. (But that&#8217;s just a personal gripe.)<br />
Last night was Game 5 in the Tampa Bay-Calgary Stanley Cup Final series. As is becoming a habit, Craig organized a gathering at the Rose and Crown, one of Calgary&#8217;s more popular watering holes. A former employee of the Rose, Craig was able to secure spaces on the third floor for us, so we&#8217;d have a place to sit and watch. Assuming we got there early enough to actually get a seat and not end up having to stand.<br />
Which of course meant that not only would the office be let out at 16:30 (it was for the last game), but I&#8217;d get stuck in an interview for a new Web Developer position until 16:50. I ended up jogging from the office (corner of 11th Ave. and 3rd St. SE) to the Rose (corner of 15th Ave. and 4th ST. SW) &#8212; a distance of about 11 blocks. All my gym excursions and healthy habits apparently have paid off &#8212; even with poor running shoes, I got there without feeling like I was going to have a heart attack.<br />
Many people sang along with Hockey Night in Canada&#8217;s opening theme, and with &#8220;O Canada&#8221;. But the cheering really didn&#8217;t kick in until the game got going. The series was tied at two games apiece, and both teams needed the advantage. Walking into Game 6 will either be staying alive or trying for the win, and it would better to be the latter.<br />
The volume in the bar was quite high &#8230; and we could barely hear the TVs. Everyone was yelling, shouting, cavorting, and several of us (Paul, Scott, Thelton, Keith, among others) were taking pictures of all the mayhem. Thelton was having particular fun emailing all the photos he&#8217;d taken with his cellphone immediately to the Calgary office email alias, to ensure that everyone arriving in the morning would see all the &#8220;glory&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m sure the patrons downstairs from us really came to despise the noisy folks on the top floor. We would stomp the floor rhythmically, chanting &#8220;Go Flames Go&#8221; as loud as we could. We would scream and yell whenever Calgary got close to Tampa Bay&#8217;s goal. The table of Cory, Chrissie, Michelle, Colin, Neil, Jason, Carl, and Julianne would chant about others in the room, for example: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go , let&#8217;s go!&#8221; until they either acknowledged the chant, or the chanters got bored and picked on someone else.<br />
The game itself was nerve-wracking. It was close. Calgary would score, then Tampa would score. It was tied when the clock ran out, and overtime began. I hate overtime. It&#8217;s such a toss-up. First goal wins, and you really get nervous when pucks get to close to your own goal. Luckily, Kiprusoff is a strong goalie, and Calgary&#8217;s defense was all over Tampa. And so it came down to the last five minutes of the first overtime period when Calgary finally popped the puck in.<br />
Total pandemonium.<br />
Within mere seconds, 17th Ave. was full of people, and traffic evacuated to the side streets. We weren&#8217;t far behind, though we had to do a couple of shots at the bar before we could get out the door. Then it was out to the Red Mile, and wandering in the direction of Melrose. The Red Sea had poured into the Red Mile.<br />
Unlike our previous ventures out onto 17th Ave. (see [[Calgary Flames win Western Conference]] and [[Calgary Flames and the 2004 Stanley Cup]]), this was a warm, dry evening, and was perfect fuel for the flashing fire. As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard (as most of North America has), Calgary&#8217;s Red Mile has turned into a &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; breast-fest of flashing. There&#8217;s websites devoted to this stuff. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll even be able to find videos in adult stores before too long (assuming, of course, that they&#8217;re not already there). It&#8217;s pretty weird, considering how this city is most of the year (save for Stampede, of course). You&#8217;d almost think we were in New Orleans or Mexico&#8230; Am I going to argue about it? No point, and no, it&#8217;s not because I want to encourage it. If people feel that liberated, all the power to them. I just hope that they consider some of the consequences.<br />
Angie got hoisted into the air on Thelton&#8217;s shoulders. Almost immediately, she was surrounded by a multitude of hormone- (and alcohol-) fuelled idiots, calling for Angie to remove her shirt. Angie, who has been known to do daring things in the past (and probably wouldn&#8217;t be objected from doing them under other circumstances) basically told them to grow up and take a hike, and returned to ground level.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay on 17th Ave. for too long, and started off in search of something else. For some reason, that was Cowboys, a bar just north of the railway tracks. After finding Angie&#8217;s car (she couldn&#8217;t quite remember where she&#8217;d parked), we wandered up 5th St., listening to the incoherent shouts above the cacaphony of car horns.<br />
When we arrived at Cowboys, I bade the others a good evening, as I headed home. Why? Simple reason: I have a moral objection to Cowboys. I do not wish to EVER enter an establishment whose waitstaff are known to have breast implants (rumoured to be paid by the bar&#8217;s owner), and over whose door there is a sign that reads: &#8220;Through these doors walk the most beautiful women in Alberta&#8221;. Thanks, but no thanks.<br />
I was quite tired when I finally got home. It was late, I was still a little inebriated, and I had to go to work the next day. One major advantage of having gone drinking with the group, though:<br />
You fall asleep fast.<br />

		<p>We all woke at about the same time. I was awake, though eyes closed, when I heard Tamara and Andrea whispering. I joined into the conversation, joined shortly thereafter by Dan. At that point, there wasn&#8217;t much reason to stay in bed, so I called first shower (I hadn&#8217;t had one since getting up &#8220;yesterday&#8221; in Japan).<br />
The plan had been to go for dim sum for breakfast, at the Chinese restaurant across the road. Not being open until 11:30 proved to be a bit of an issue, however, so we opted for breakfast #2: IHOP. Unlike Calgary, there is an International House of Pancakes in Kelowna. And we weren&#8217;t the only ones who knew that. The lineup was clearly out the door, and not just by a few people. It would be a long wait before we got breakfast if we&#8217;d stayed. We opted for the much shorter lineup at a nearby Perkins.<br />
It felt good to not eat Japanese for a change.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I don&#8217;t watch awards shows, as a whole. They&#8217;re mostly dull and boring. They feature people whom I don&#8217;t care about, and subjects that I couldn&#8217;t care less about.<br />
But then there&#8217;s the Academy Awards.<br />
I haven&#8217;t missed the Oscars since &#8230; well, since so long, I honesty can&#8217;t remember how old I was when I first saw the awards, but I&#8217;ve been addicted for years. Be it for Billy Crystal&#8217;s wit (Billy, please continue to do the show &#8212; you are without a doubt the best host since Bob Hope), or for the speeches, the surprises, the goofiness, it&#8217;s kept me captivated for years.<br />
This has been a hard year for the movie industry. Not only plagued with piracy on a public level, the industry has faced the loss of talent on a level that hasn&#8217;t been felt before on a such a level during my life. Unlike years previous, there were tributes specifically for two of the Academy&#8217;s greatest starts, Bob Hope and Kathryn Hepburn. But when the tribute to the rest of the stars came, there were names in there that forever changed the way we watch movies. It was far too many names to see lost within such a short period of time.<br />
The hard part of this is that the older I get, the more names I recognize. I suppose this is the way of things to come. The names in the future, I&#8217;ll know more often than not. One day, I&#8217;ll probably know them all. It&#8217;s almost like losing good friends, even if they&#8217;re ones I&#8217;ve never met.<br />
And once again, like last year, I need to thank the Academy for doing the right things. This year was not really a year of surprises. Pretty much everyone who was pegged to win, won. There were no real upsets, no surprises, no shockers. Okay, yes, that is a little boring. But it means that those responsible for voting didn&#8217;t make political decisions &#8212; they went with the right ones.<br />
Well, yes, the fact that Lord of the Rings swept every category could be construed as political, especially because it didn&#8217;t really win in previous years. But let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Let&#8217;s realize that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the most influential set of movies seen in the last decade. And nothing like that had ever been done before. The people nominated were those who&#8217;d worked on all three movies. Certainly there were other movies deserving of awards, but given the sheer scope of work, and the body that it represents, not to mention the quality of the final product, there is no question of who is deserving.<br />
Best Actor. Sean Penn. Perhaps I would have preferred Johnny Depp, but I can live with Sean Penn. There are a number of people who say he is the Marlon Brando of our age. With all due respect, Sean Penn is far more talented than that &#8212; I can actually stand to watch Penn&#8217;s performances.<br />
Best Actress. Haven&#8217;t seen Monster yet, but if Charlize Theron is willing to go that far for the sake of a role, then she&#8217;s deserves it.<br />
I could go on with the other awards, but let&#8217;s be honest. When Lord of the Rings wins all 11 of its nominations, there&#8217;s no reason to even bother mentioning the others. (Okay, maybe I should, but simply put, if you haven&#8217;t read about them, I&#8217;m not about to shed any light here &#8212; there&#8217;s plenty better places to see it all.)<br />
Thank you, AMPAS. Thank you for realizing that Lord of the Rings isn&#8217;t just a bunch of fantasy-obsessed teenage boys who need to see wizards. Thank you for seeing that it&#8217;s more than just some interesting words in a very long set of books. There is something powerful to this, and only a mind like Peter Jackson could bring it to life.<br />
And thank you for getting Billy Crystal back. Please make sure you keep up the good work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, David Bowie reminded us all how a concert should be done.<br />
Well, technically *last* night, but since it&#8217;s just after midnight as I write this, it&#8217;s still the same night. Anyway, you get the point.<br />
Tamara and I had planned this from several months ago (sometime in September or October), when we&#8217;d heard about an IMAX presentation of David Bowie&#8217;s new album, &#8220;Reality&#8221;. The two of us hussled down to the Paramount Chinook to score some tickets to watch the show. As it turned out, it was the best move we could make. As a result of that show, we&#8217;d found out that members of Bowie&#8217;s fan club had access to an Internet presale of tickets to his concert in Calgary.<br />
Within moments of getting home, Tamara had joined the club, and we had ordered tickets for us, Tamara&#8217;s parents, and a few of Tamara&#8217;s friends. But the choice tickets went to us.<br />
On the floor. In the eighth row. We&#8217;d be able to see Bowie&#8217;s *sweat*.<br />
Well, you can imagine the wait. It was long. Both of us wanted to see this show. For both Tamara and I, seeing David Bowie play is one of those (potentially) once-in-a-lifetime things. And unlike other acts who come and go, Bowie is a monolith in the industry &#8212; the one other acts look to. Elvis might have been the King, but it is the Thin White Duke who rules.<br />
The first time I&#8217;d heard David Bowie was in the early 80s. It was one song: &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;, from his &#8220;Let&#8217;s Dance&#8221; album. I don&#8217;t know what it was. Hook, line, and sinker. Since then, I&#8217;ve kept track of David&#8217;s career &#8212; not only his musical one, but also his acting (Bowie&#8217;s done several movies, including Jim Henson&#8217;s &#8220;Labyrinth&#8221; and &#8220;The Linguine Incident&#8221;). Ever since that first song, I&#8217;ve been a fan.<br />
We started the evening at Catch. I had given Tamara a gift certificate for Christmas, as she had regularly expressed her desire to eat there. I endulged (perhaps a little too much, but hey, it&#8217;s been a rough week). Unfortunately, we ended up running a little late, so we left without noticing that Tamara&#8217;s $50 certificate hadn&#8217;t, in fact, come off the bill. Something I&#8217;ll have to address in the morning.<br />
We grabbed a taxi to the Saddledome, arriving partway into Macy Gray&#8217;s opening act. (Bowie, if nothing else, knows that while the opening act should never be better than the headliner, it still needs to be solid.) My only regret of the evening (the gift certificate fiasco notwithstanding) was missing part of Macy Gray&#8217;s act.<br />
Arriving on the floor, we had to have someone guide us to our seats, not having a clue where they were. We figured we were off to the sides, which would have been fine for us. We just wanted to see the show. But the guide led us to the middle of the rows, eight away from the stage. Our seats were nearly dead-centre. We could see the individual hair fibres in Macy Gray&#8217;s afro.<br />
Tamara and I were damn near giddy with delight.<br />
Macy Gray is a solid performer. A bit of a freak, perhaps, but a total class act. And her band takes a great deal of pride in the work that they do. The result is an amazing show. I would gladly see Macy Gray again, should she swing around this area. (And a note to all of you who have yet to see David Bowie&#8217;s Reality show &#8212; don&#8217;t show up late! You won&#8217;t be disappointed.)<br />
The house lights soon came up, and the roadies began to set up for Bowie. Tamara disappeared for a while with her father (he and Tamara&#8217;s mother were a row behind us, about six seats to the right), returning about 10 minutes before the show with a tour book, and two drinks (I was the recipient of a free beer). And we waited.<br />
But we didn&#8217;t have to wait long. About 20:45, the music on the PA system changed, and suddenly you could hear David&#8217;s voice, and the band started playing. But no-one was on stage, and the lights hadn&#8217;t yet dimmed. The pixelboard behind the performer&#8217;s area came to life, showing an animated version of the band practicing. The lights started going out. The crowd was getting loud.<br />
It was time.<br />
One by one, David Bowie&#8217;s band started entering the stage. People whose names are usually forgotten were cheered loudly as they took their positions. There was a long pause from when the last one picked up their instrument until David walked out on stage, to deafening cheers and whistles. Without missing a single beat, they jumped right into what appears to be the opening song on the tour, &#8220;Rebel Rebel&#8221;.<br />
It was amazing. For the next two hours, David and his band flipped around over 35 years of music, switching from songs from his new album, to songs from his first, and almost every album in between. Ones you never heard of, ones that you heard yesterday, and ones that were great almost a generation ago. All but two or three, I knew or at least had heard once before.<br />
David Bowie isn&#8217;t just a singer-songwriter. He&#8217;s a performer. When he&#8217;s just singing, he&#8217;s acting. He&#8217;s making love to the audience because he wants to draw them into his world. For two hours, that&#8217;s precisely what happened. You were absorbed by his energy (I can only hope to look like him when I&#8217;m 57 years old), his passion, and his presence. He commanded without even having to really try.<br />
&#8220;Reality&#8221;, &#8220;New Killer Star&#8221;, &#8220;Fame&#8221;, &#8220;Under Pressure&#8221; (David&#8217;s bassist sings Freddie Mercury&#8217;s part amazingly well), &#8220;Life on Mars?&#8221;, &#8220;Ashes to Ashes&#8221;, &#8220;Heroes&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m Afraid of Americans&#8221; (which got a huge boost from the audience), &#8220;Ziggy Stardust&#8221;, and many others were all readily cheered. It was, without a doubt, one of the loudest concerts I&#8217;d been to &#8212; and not because of the band. (My ears are ringing, but I&#8217;ve been to louder, and much worse, concerts.)<br />
Early in the show, David decided that we&#8217;d done such a good job singing &#8220;All The Young Dudes&#8221;, that we could sing &#8220;China Girl&#8221; without him. The band started playing, but when the singing should have started, there wasn&#8217;t a peep from the audience (at least that you could hear). Bowie looked quite disgusted. He stopped the band, walked up to the mike, and announced:<br />
&#8220;That was fucking tragic.&#8221;<br />
He laughed with the rest of us, and then restarted the song, this time taking lead of the vocals. He seemed to like the audience participation. During his 5-6 song encore (I&#8217;m not sure exactly how many songs he did), he played a personal favourite: &#8220;Suffragette City&#8221;. There&#8217;s just nothing quite like hearing 13-odd thousand people all screaming: &#8220;Wham, bam, thank you, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; at the top of their lungs.<br />
There were two songs that I&#8217;d wanted to hear: &#8220;Space Oddity&#8221; and my personal favourite, &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;. According to his website, however, those songs haven&#8217;t appeared on any of his play lists. *Sigh* Well, if nothing else, it just gives me an excuse to see him the next time he&#8217;s anywhere in the area &#8230; which means most of this section of North America, of course.<br />
When the house lights came back on, it was hard to believe it was over. The energy had been amazing &#8212; we could have easily listened for another two hours. But it was almost 23:00, and time for most people to go home. (Some of us have to work tomorrow.)<br />
Tonight, David Bowie rocked Calgary. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of the Thin White Duke.</p>

		<p>First off, Happy New Year everyone!<br />
2003 was quite a year &#8212; quite a few good things, and a number of bad ones. In fact, not a lot of good ones, worldly-speaking, that is. Although not all the &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; lists are out yet, the ones that are on the Internet are (not surprisingly) mostly negative. Lots of death and tragedy, with the odd curling win to make things brighter. Let&#8217;s just hope this year comes with a little less strife than the year past.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, the Greedy Bastard hit Cowtown.<br />
The Bastard in question, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is Eric Idle. For those of you buried under rocks since the day of your birth, Eric was one of Britain&#8217;s Monty Python comedy troupe, makers of several years of quality British television and such movies as &#8220;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&#8221;, &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s Life of Brian&#8221;, and &#8220;Monty Python&#8217;s The Meaning of Life&#8221;.<br />
Eric is self-described as the sixth most friendly Python, after Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman, and John Cleese. For those of you unawares, there are only six members of Monty Python. Having now met the man in person, he certainly is pleasant enough.<br />
Eric is the only current touring (former) member of Monty Python. John has a successful acting career (although Eric&#8217;s is fairly prolific), Michael has done several series for the BBC (a documentary-like version of &#8220;Around the World in 80 Days&#8221;), Terry Gilliam is one of Hollywood&#8217;s more ecclectic directors, and Terry Jones has done some bit parts and a few books (he co-authored &#8220;Starship Titanic&#8221; with &#8220;Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy&#8221; author Douglas Adams). Graham Chapman died in 1989.<br />
This time through North America (running October to the end of December), Eric&#8217;s running under the banner: &#8220;The Greedy Ba$tard Tour: Another Stupid Evening&#8230;&#8221;. For all those who think he&#8217;s doing it just for money, he&#8217;ll agree with you 100% of the way. As he started off when he came on stage: &#8220;This is to earn money so I can send my daughter through college &#8230; and my wife through collegen.&#8221;<br />
Tamara, Nick, and I went in a group of three, but weren&#8217;t the only Critical Mass folk out. Steve was there with his girlfriend, as was John with his. I can only assume there were others, but we never saw any of them. It was good to see that the three of us weren&#8217;t the only ones interested in a good laugh.<br />
We arrived at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Theatre (usually referred to as just &#8220;The Jubilee&#8221;) around 19:35, for a 20:00 show. Nick and I are Python fans &#8212; Nick even knows some of the The Rutles (Eric&#8217;s answer to The Beatles). Checking the coats (and stashing the camera), we headed in to find our seats.<br />
I&#8217;d never been to The Jubilee before. It&#8217;s not at all what I expected. It&#8217;s attached to the Alberta College of Art and Design (known more informally as ACAD), but does not look at all like a school auditorium. It&#8217;s a three-tiered honest-to-God theatre, regularly hosting operas and ballets. Tonight, it hosted an &#8220;adults-only&#8221; show. Some of Python&#8217;s material, and some of Eric&#8217;s comedy, is not for kids.<br />
The stage was simple: a small piano on the (audience&#8217;s) left side, and a coat rack, chair, guitar stand, and throw rug on the right. Music played softly as people entered the auditorium. With only minutes to the show, the music became louder, as The Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; started playing. Several people in the audience did the motions in the chorus. Then one of the actors (it wasn&#8217;t Eric) walked out on stage as one of the Gumbys &#8212; a Python character known for abject stupidity. He attempted the chorus motions. The audience laughed.<br />
The music changed to the infamous &#8220;Spam&#8221; theme, sung by ancient Vikings. (Yep, another Python skit.) On came Eric, to a cacaphony of whistles, hollers, yells, screams, and a lot of clapping. After the crowd calmed down, he started into his routine, pausing only to introduce something never done before: the Encore Bucket.<br />
This was a shiny, stainless steel garbage can. It&#8217;s Eric&#8217;s way of ensuring that he comes on for an encore. The idea is that you throw money in there (or women&#8217;s underwear &#8212; he&#8217;s trying to break through the Tom Jones Barrier), and if there&#8217;s enough, he&#8217;ll do an encore. In reality, all money collected goes to charity (Eric keeps the underwear). So if you&#8217;re seeing Eric Idle&#8217;s Greedy Bastard Tour, bring a few extra bucks for charity.<br />
The only time he took a truly serious note was to mark that tonight is the second anniversary of George Harrison&#8217;s death. Harrison produced movies, and footed the entire bill for &#8220;Life of Brian&#8221;. As Eric put it: &#8220;The most expensive movie ticket, ever!&#8221; Eric and George had been good friends for many years.<br />
As Eric&#8217;s opening dialogue went on, he explained that he had been to The Jubilee before &#8212; 30 years ago, with the rest of Monty Python, on the first (and last) tour of Canada. Eric has been through Canada a couple of times since (his previous tour was &#8220;Eric Idle Exploits Monty Python&#8221;). On his last tour, he was presented with none other than the Monty Python hook, a very long, crooked pole used to drag people offstage in their skits. The group had left it behind in Vancouver at the end of their tour 30 years ago, and Eric was presented it when he returned a couple of years ago.<br />
As he said: &#8220;I can only imagine what this would fetch on eBay!&#8221;<br />
I have to admit that I was a little skeptical as to the content of the show. I mean, I like Monty Python a lot, but would the show really be anything original? It was just Eric, and there&#8217;s no telling if the rest of the players would have the same comedic timing of Python. I was quite happily relieved to find that Eric&#8217;s happy band of six people (including himself) were quite up to the task. And even after many shows, his co-players can still crack up on stage.<br />
We were treated to many classic Python songs, including &#8220;The Penis Song&#8221;, &#8220;The Philosopher&#8217;s Song&#8221;, &#8220;Sit On My Face&#8221;, &#8220;Eric The Half-A-Bee&#8221;, &#8220;I Like Chinese&#8221;, &#8220;Galaxy Song&#8221;, and of course, the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221;. We hoped for &#8220;Every Sperm Is Sacred&#8221;, but not that night. (Tamara had never heard the &#8220;Lumberjack Song&#8221; before, but had it stuck in her head from the moment she heard it until well after we were home.)<br />
The tickets weren&#8217;t cheap ($55), but it was worth every penny. The show was funny, and even localized. (They rewrote the &#8220;Wink, Wink, Nudge, Nudge&#8221; skit so that the wife was from Okotoks &#8212; something we found extremely funny, because Tamara&#8217;s from Okotoks.) They included some Canadian humour, including ye olde poke fun at Americans.<br />
Two and a half hours after the show started, it was over. Nick and I ran into the autograph line so we could get things signed. We had hoped for the DVDs we had brought, but a sign read: &#8220;The Greedy Bastard will only sign purchased merchandise&#8221;. Thirty dollars later, I have a signed t-shirt. Hey, I might never get another chance to meet a Python.<br />
I did get a chance to speak to Eric. I thanked him for coming to Calgary, and hoped he would return again. He looked quite tired (the show takes a lot out of you when you&#8217;re 62 years young), but was still the quintessential showman.<br />
Even for a self-proclaimed Bastard.</p>
