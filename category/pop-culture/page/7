	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Normally, around this time of year, I rant about the really dumb decisions the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science makes when awarding their own. Normally, it&#8217;s because they give Oscars to those who &#8220;deserve&#8221; the award, not those who&#8217;ve earned it.<br />
Not this year. This year, I actually have to praise them for making the hard choices.<br />
Last night, I convinced Tamara and her friend Todd to watch the Oscars. Didn&#8217;t take much &#8212; all I had to say was that &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221; was up for Best Documentary. That was enough in Tamara&#8217;s books to watch the rest of the ceremony. We missed the beginning of the show, but came in just as the awards were beginning.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s get most of the nitty-gritties out of the way. Best Animated Feature Film could only have been Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s &#8220;Spirited Away&#8221;. Having seen all the other nominees except &#8220;Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron&#8221;, there was but one choice. Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Chris Cooper and Catherine Zeta-Jones) gave me no reason to argue (though I might have preferred John C. Reilly in &#8220;Chicago&#8221;). &#8220;Chicago&#8221; scooped most of the primo awards, but considering the competition, that wasn&#8217;t all that surprising.<br />
But the night was a rollercoaster of surprises. Unlike previous years where the winners were always predictable, this series seemed to play to the underdogs and renegades of the industry. Adrien Brody winning Best Actor for &#8220;The Pianist&#8221; threw a lot of people &#8212; I was expecting Daniel Day-Lewis. (Not that I&#8217;m arguing with the choice.) Eminem taking out music heavyweights like &#8220;Chicago&#8221;, U2, and Paul Simon was extremely welcome (although the guy who accepted could have least had the decency to wear something better). The Best Original Screenplay went to a foreign film, &#8220;Talk to Her&#8221; &#8212; an Oscar rarity. And despite all the controversy, Roman Polanski won the coveted Best Director.<br />
Nothing was more surprising, and more pleasing, than hearing &#8220;Michael Moore, &#8216;Bowling for Columbine'&#8221; being read out. Both Tamara and I cried out in joy. Frankly, I thought Moore&#8217;s chances of winning were virtually none. Heck, I was shocked that he was even nominated! (Though I had a personal note never to watch the Oscars again if they didn&#8217;t nominate the movie. I guess someone listened to me for a change.)<br />
If you&#8217;re wondering why I was shocked about the nomination, you obviously haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;Bowling&#8221; or know who Michael Moore is. The guy is possibly the single most politically-charged firebrand in the States at the moment. (Even previous Academy Awards where Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon made statements barely even come close to what Moore did.) In &#8220;Bowling&#8221;, he asks a lot of hard questions, though finds it almost impossible to actually get them answered. He even confronts Hollywood heavyweights Dick Clark and Charleton Heston. Both come out looking a lot dirtier as a result. Heston takes a cinematic beating, however, retreating from Moore&#8217;s questioning by merely walking away.<br />
For those insults, I thought Moore&#8217;s changes of a nomination were nil. Okay, so he gets nominated &#8212; no chance he&#8217;ll win. The institutionalization of Hollywood won&#8217;t allow it. I would kill for a video tape of the production booth when &#8220;Bowling&#8221; won. The producers probably dove immediately into recovery mode. Because as soon as the standing ovation ended, and the quick thank-you was done, they knew that Moore&#8217;s political views would turn the heat up inside.<br />
Hell of a way to get a ratings boost, though.<br />
So the speech was barely cut short (Adrien Brody actually managed to get an extension, but finished his war speech far more tactfully than Moore&#8217;s), but the point was made. I think that&#8217;s all Moore really wanted to do. I don&#8217;t think he returned for the rest of the evening. Mind you, after his speech, producers might have just avoided showing him again. Steve Martin (the host) joked that Teamsters were helping Moore into the trunk of his limo. It was Moore&#8217;s first Oscar, and my guess is that it&#8217;ll be his last. Something tells me, though, that he won&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
I want to thank the Academy, for doing the right thing for a change!</p>

		<blockquote><p>One is left with the horrible feeling now that war settles nothing; that to win a war is as disastrous as to lose one.<br />

<blockquote><p>War is not nice.<br />
<cite>Barbara Bush (wife of Fmr. President George Bush, and mother of current President George W. Bush)</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>A little over 12 years ago, I sat on the floor of my bedroom, watching in silence as the Gulf War burst into horrific life. I had been greatly saddened by the events, and greatly worried that our world was about to boil over into something much more serious.<br />
Imagine my shock when I sat down to watch a little television tonight. At 19:45 MST, the White House spokesman stepped onto the podium, saying that operations had begun in Iraq, and the President would be addressing the nation in 30 minutes. I had planned to do some work. Instead, I suddenly felt 12 years younger, and a lot more worried about the future.<br />
When Dubya went on the air a half hour later, I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what to expect. Except for armageddon, of course. Sure enough, through all the rhetoric, the message was quite clear: The &#8220;Allied Forces&#8221; (comprised mostly of America and British forces) had started their attack on Iraq. Exact details weren&#8217;t clear, but from what I could glean from CBC and CNN, the US had launched a barrage of missiles into Iraq as part of a &#8220;decapitation&#8221; strike, trying to take out Iraqi leadership.<br />
No matter how you try and make it sound nice, a &#8220;decapitation strike&#8221; sounds about as appealing as a root canal without painkillers.<br />
I can only imagine what we&#8217;ll see in the coming weeks. No commentator can agree on the details. Some think this will be a fast war, some think it will drag on for weeks, maybe months. Some say the Iraqis don&#8217;t have a lot to offer in the way of defence, others suggest that the Allied forces are outnumbered four to one. They are agreed on a couple of things: the US will spend countless billions to fund this war, and a lot of people are going to lose their lives. And it&#8217;s almost certain that the protests will begin tomorrow.<br />
There are two sad ironies in all this. First, the US can&#8217;t really &#8220;restore&#8221; democracy to Iraq. If they do, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that the electorate will vote in a follower of Islam, who would more than likely not bow to the will of the US. So Iraq will likely be run under a US-positioned puppet. At least until that person decides that they don&#8217;t want to listen any more, start doing their own thing, and bring the US military back in about two decades.<br />
Second, terrorism will likely increase as a result. No-one seems to have considered this part. Striking an Arab nation (even one run by a despot) will only succeed in angering neighbouring nations. Most certainly, this will raise the fur on Al Quaeda&#8217;s back. We can only certainly expect a reprisal at some point.<br />
It&#8217;s debatable whether the Iraqi people are going to be better off as a result of all this. Everyone seems to be speaking of them, but more concerned with their own self-importance and sword-waving. Only the United Nations seems to have a rational head on their shoulders. It&#8217;s too bad that legally, they&#8217;ll have no recourse against the US and UK. It&#8217;s all fine for the UN to crack down on a small rogue nation. But what do you do when two of your most powerful nations go renegade? The coolest heads seem to be coming from France and Germany: Two countries that know all-too-well the horrors of war and of occupation.<br />
I find it interesting that 65 years ago, another nation that opted to force its opinion and will on others started the &#8220;War to end all wars&#8221;. It was horror the likes of which no-one had seen before, and has brought us 60 years of stories (fictional and non).<br />
Actually, I take that back. It&#8217;s not interesting. It&#8217;s frightening.<br />
&#8216;Cuz we might end up with a front row seat.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The year 4700 on the Chinese calendar got off to a very sombre start.<br />
Today is Chinese New Year&#8217;s day. Today, I had many things I wanted to do. Most of them were summarily forgotten when, barely a few minutes out of bed, Tamara announced: &#8220;The space shuttle blew up.&#8221; I took pause. I was barely awake enough to know that this was bad, but not awake enough for it to truly have effect.<br />
I marched downstairs and turned on CNN. The coverage wasn&#8217;t as intense as September 11th (see [[Reaction to September 11, 2001 (9/11)]]). CNN was skipping commercials, in favour of coverage. They flipped around constantly, talking with reporters from all over America, periodically talking with an official or former engineer. CBC had entirely different coverage, actually bringing in Roberta Bondar to talk with their anchor. A press conference with the Canadian Space Agency featured Marc Garneau.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t the oppressive feeling of loss or shock. Perhaps we&#8217;ve just become too immune. Then an interesting fact came to light &#8212; it was 17 years and four days since the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded over the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds into the 25th shuttle mission.<br />
Just after noon, I was doing my duty as a student crossing guard, curbing the flow of traffic so students could return to school after lunch. As usual, one girl &#8212; a few grades behind me &#8212; came up to deliver her daily torture. For some reason, we didn&#8217;t much like each other. She was a little caustic, and I had a superiority complex. Yet we each recognized this, and turned it into a game. On that day, however, she instead told me the truth: The shuttle had exploded.<br />
At first, I hadn&#8217;t believed her. The shuttle couldn&#8217;t explode. It was the space shuttle! It was NASA! That sort of thing just doesn&#8217;t happen. (This was long before I&#8217;d learned of the Apollo 1 fire, or saw video of NASA&#8217;s early rocket failures.) My faith in the American space programme was unfaltering. I expected there to be regular flights into space by the time I was 20. For the shuttle to explode just seemed too fantastic.<br />
The truth sank in before I returned to school after lunch. Most of my friends didn&#8217;t go home for lunch, and didn&#8217;t know. They seemed as doubtful as I had been. Barely a few minutes into class, the principal called an assembly in the gym. It was true. The shuttle had exploded barely a minute off the launchpad. I don&#8217;t remember the rest of the afternoon. But I watched the entire 6:00pm CityTV news broadcast, which had been almost entirely devoted to the shuttle disaster (only five minutes were granted to other news).<br />
Seventeen years later, the reaction was different. People seemed shocked, yes, but more were accepting of the dangers of spaceflight. It seems that while people do become complacent about regular shuttle launches, they seem to all know that eventually, something will go wrong. When Tamara had told me the shuttle exploded, I assumed it was a launch. Breaking up on reentry was something I had not considered.<br />
I eventually did run a few errands. But in the back of my mind the entire time was what sort of things could I expect to see. Thoughts of what I&#8217;d seen on September 11th still haunt me. I saw and heard nothing. It was almost like it hadn&#8217;t happened. In fact, if Calgary had been upset by the disaster, it was already well on the way to recovery. Chinese New Year went ahead without pause. It was business as usual.<br />
Still, everyone seemed to talk about the loss of Columbia, even if it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on their minds. We still went to Chinese New Year dinner. We still went about our lives. But the thought is still there. I don&#8217;t know if in 17 years, I&#8217;ll remember where I was today.<br />
But I will remember what happened.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Assuming you&#8217;re not avoiding the media or living under a rather large rock, you&#8217;ve probably heard that the second chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy opened today.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I&#8217;ve already seen it.<br />
A few weeks ago (over a month, actually), the Famous Players Paramount Chinook theatre started selling tickets for opening night. First showing: 12:01am.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: That&#8217;s when we saw it.<br />
There were originally just three of us: Adrian, Tamara, and myself. But Jensenne caught wind, and wanted to tag along. The more, the merrier, I say! Besides, then I have more &#8220;normal&#8221; people to stand around so I don&#8217;t look like such a dork being surrounded by obsessed Tolkien fans. (Okay, yes, I was there at midnight for a movie &#8230; but it&#8217;s a good movie!)  And believe me, there were a number of them. They started lining up early. At noon.<br />
Yup, a full twelve hours before the movie started. Why? Good question &#8212; I&#8217;m sure their lives can&#8217;t be so empty of fulfillment that 12 hours is nothing to them. Mind you, Star Wars fans tend more to the obsessive side. Both Tolkien and Star Wars fans are geeky &#8212; can&#8217;t avoid that one. They get really wrapped up in the story, the characters, the ethos of the whole thing. But there are differences between the two. Tolkien fans dress up as characters. Star Wars fans are the characters.<br />
Then there&#8217;s Trekkies. Let&#8217;s not go there.<br />
John was the first person in our group to arrive on the scene, and mostly by accident. He was in the theatre for another reason, and happened to notice &#8212; at 6:00pm &#8212; that the line was already underway. Due to the fortunes of modern technology, the line would form quickly. Our team would fall into place in line, myself being the last to arrive around 9:00pm. (There&#8217;s another whole story to that, but I&#8217;ll spare you the tangent.)<br />
There were noticeable people in the line. A couple were dressed up in costume. One carried a sign on a staff that read: &#8220;One sign to rule them all.&#8221; (Hey, I said Tolkien fans were reserved &#8212; I didn&#8217;t say they were any less geeky than the others.) The group sitting behind us brought &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; Risk &#8212; until that time unopened. The drawback was that none of them had played before. By the time they&#8217;d gotten underway, we had to move the line again. The single best way to kill time in line was the guy who&#8217;d brought a laptop with a DVD player. I&#8217;ll give you three guesses what movie he played.<br />
And no, it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#8221;.<br />
The line formed quickly. Within an hour of my arrival, we&#8217;d already had to shuffle the line twice to prevent blocking other doors. By 10:00, there were so many people in line, we couldn&#8217;t sit down anymore. Sardines have more room. People had to get creative with ways to keep from going mildly mental standing in the line. Tamara got smart and brought playing cards a Nintendo Gameboy. Which, in retrospect, was her downfall&#8230;<br />
A-Channel (a local independent television station) sent out a camera crew to get footage of the freaks in line. Tamara laughed about this, mocking the few at the front who would likely stand out the most. So imagine her surprise, and our amusement, when an A-Channel camera peered over her shoulder as she played Tetris, then thrust a microphone in her face to ask her a question about how she had prepared to stand in line. There&#8217;s nothing like actually seeing the look of &#8220;Please God, not me&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Twenty minutes, and we were in the theatre. After standing for well over an hour, it was good to sit down again. Snacks, a quick run through the washroom, and it was magic time&#8230;<br />
A little over three hours later, we filtered out of the screening (some of us making fast dashes for the washrooms) and headed off into the quiet Wednesday morning. We made a fairly hasty return home. I had to be at work this morning, as per usual. Three hours&#8217; sleep really doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. Good thing work is slow right now.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I fell asleep at work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Tuesday (12 November 2002), the extended version of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released on DVD. The standard theatrical release came out a few months ago, but this was the one I was waiting for &#8212; more material, worth the price I was going to pay.<br />
The bold idea, of course, was to really show this movie. In fact, it was about as good an excuse as any to hold the first true &#8220;Movie Night&#8221; in my house. Chris and I used to hold movie nights all the time in our apartment, but due to lack of time, space, furniture, and the fact that at times my home looked more like the aftermath of a F-5 tornado than a house pretty much kept large events at bay.<br />
Until now.<br />
This release was reason enough to drag out a considerable number of people to my home, sit down, and listen to the movie at a volume that would deafen most teenagers. The subwoofer was turned up so much the floor shook. I&#8217;m sure that if my windows didn&#8217;t have brass strip accents, they would have rattled. The room was dark, and everyone had goosepimples. It was great.<br />
We paused the movie a couple of times, one for the when Virgil&#8217;s pizza arrived, a second (much longer) time when our Chinese food arrived (it had been far too long since our last Chinese dinner), and one last time when the first disc ended.<br />
Yes, the &#8220;first&#8221; disc. The extended version is on four discs. No, the movie itself doesn&#8217;t extend across all four &#8212; just the first two. Why so long? Well, the movie itself is 208 minutes &#8212; that&#8217;s pretty long, even for a DVD. Tack on a small army of extra audio channels, and suddenly you&#8217;ve got too much information for one measly little DVD disc.<br />
So we took a slight break. I popped out the first disc, swapped in the second, and pressed play. And then I crossed my fingers.<br />
Why cross fingers? That&#8217;s to compensate for my rather bad luck. You see, I had the set still in the A&amp;B plastic bag, and sealed in its wrapper. I hadn&#8217;t opened it. I wanted to preserve it so that its first real viewing would be in front of my friends. Naturally, that meant that it wouldn&#8217;t work.<br />
Have I ever mentioned that Murphy is my best friend?<br />
At first, the disc took an inordinately long time to load. My first thought: this wasn&#8217;t loading. There, that was my problem! Oh well, my luck &#8230; the disc finished loading and the title came up on the display. Huh &#8212; how &#8217;bout that, no problem! Well&#8230; so I thought, until I heard:<br />
Them: &#8220;Geoff, you doofus! You put the first disc in!&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s the right one!&#8221; (I check the discs, just to make sure.)<br />
Them: &#8220;Then why is the first disc&#8217;s contents on-screen?&#8221;<br />
I scratched my head. The first disc was in the case. I popped the disc out. Disc Two.<br />
Me: &#8220;Ha! This is the second disc!&#8221;<br />
Them: &#8220;Ha! You should have checked your copy before inviting us over!&#8221;<br />
They had a point.<br />
It appears that A&amp;B received a batch of bad copies of the movie. Somehow, I should have expected this. In fact, I pretty much did. This is how much luck tends to go. But where there&#8217;s a will (or a great deal of stubbornness), there&#8217;s a way. A nearby Blockbuster also helps.<br />
Not surprisingly, their copies were all rented. Audrey, however, took charge, and asked if there were any copies &#8220;lying around&#8221; that we could rent. Nada. Audrey didn&#8217;t stop, and had them check other stores. One of the nearby Blockbusters had one copy remaining.<br />
A mere viewing of the movie wasn&#8217;t enough. No, we had to engage our own quest for the ring. Audrey, Adrian, Calvin, and myself braved the treacherous Fire Lights of the Tenth Road, the decaying Bridge of Bow, a hurried run past the edge of the Forest of Glass Towers, and onto the hedonistic Avenue of Drunken Morons, finally arriving at the Blockbuster of Mount Doom, er, Royal. Obtaining our movie, we headed north on 14th Aisle of Laggan, before turning into the Hamlet of Kensington, and finally to Hobbiton, I mean, my house.<br />
Lights, DVD, action!<br />
We resumed our movie, revelling in the visual and aural bombardment. The cats wisely stayed out of the living room. The movie finally ended at half-past midnight, a full hour and a half after it should have.<br />
But such is the nature of a quest &#8212; you never know when it will truly end.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Long weekends are rarely long enough. I&#8217;d like one to last about a year, personally, but without all the seasonal changes. But I suppose that&#8217;s what Hawaii is for&#8230;<br />
My weekend (sort of) started on Thursday night, with the premiere of &#8220;Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones&#8221;. Although I&#8217;m still not sold on the title, I think the movie is a vast improvement over Episode One. And it&#8217;s gonna be a heck of a lead-in for Episode Three.<br />
One thing that was definitely missing this time was hype. True, hype can severely detriment a film. It can drag it down by setting expectations far too high. But at the same time, there&#8217;s such a powerful excitement that you really don&#8217;t care if the movie sucks or not &#8212; you just want to be there. While I can&#8217;t speak for either Therese or Stuart, I was a little disenchanted this time. Even when the words: &#8220;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&#8230;&#8221; came up, and the audience went ballistic (I love opening night crowds), I didn&#8217;t feel that excited grin cross my face. It was almost as if I was just seeing another movie.<br />
Maybe I was, but wasn&#8217;t willing to accept it. Who knows &#8212; a few people have speculated that this hasn&#8217;t exactly been the best year for me: My father passing away, my workload and responsibility load increasing dramatically, and now Chris having left for Japan. (And we&#8217;re not even half-way through the year yet.) I suppose it&#8217;s entirely possible that the joy I should feel last left. Is it time for a change in lifestyle, perhaps? Well, I&#8217;ve got one coming soon&#8230;<br />
The date of closure of my house is coming soon. In less than two weeks, I&#8217;ll be in my &#8220;new&#8221; house. I had originally feared that the excitement I first felt upon buying the house would eventually dissipate, and I wouldn&#8217;t end up wanting to move. Thankfully, the last few days have shown me that I am not only ready to leave my apartment, but I can&#8217;t wait to move into the house. Right now, I need the patience of a Jedi just to keep from bursting my skin wanting to move in. I&#8217;ve started driving by the house, just to remind myself. At times, this still feels like a dream. Whether or not it turns out to be a nightmare remains to be seen&#8230;<br />
On Friday night, I was supposed to attend Star Wars with friends from the office. However, I had other plans &#8212; seeing friends I haven&#8217;t seen for a very long time: Ed and Jen. Ed is one of my friends from first year university, and was one of my roommates during my second year. Both years rank very highly in my best and most cherished memories. It had been over four years since I&#8217;d last seen Jen &#8212; about one and a half since I&#8217;d last seen Ed &#8212; and in both cases it had been far too long.<br />
They arrived on the 9:45pm flight from Toronto, and despite looking a little dazed (and being quite hungry), they looked almost exactly the way I&#8217;d last remembered them. It&#8217;s good to know some things don&#8217;t change too much. We picked up their luggage, arranged for their rental car, and headed to my apartment. (Although I had sent them instructions on how to get there, I figured it was just plain easier for me to pick them up. Long flights and detailed instructions rarely mix well.)<br />
After unceremoniously dumping their belongings at the apartment, we adjourned to Ceili&#8217;s for a late evening meal (of chicken wings and seasoned chicken bites) and beer. It was also a chance to retell old stories, catch up on new ones, and retie the old bonds that had kept us friends. If anything, it reinforced the need for me to visit with friends this year, especially those I haven&#8217;t seen for a long time.<br />
We were in bed relatively early (I was plenty tired, and they were jet lagged), and up by 8:30. Ed and Jen were parked out on the street, which expired by 9:00 &#8212; besides, they wanted to get a start on the day and get on their camping vacation. The first order of business however, was breakfast. I knew of two places not too far away that were supposedly quite good, but only one I knew of for certain &#8212; The Galaxie Diner.<br />
This is probably about as landmark as a Calgary restaurant gets. And it has, according to my breakfast cohorts, some of the best breakfasts available. You just need to get there fairly early. Something I definitely need to keep in mind for the next time people are out this way.<br />
Following breakfast was a series of trips to get provisions and supplies for Ed and Jen. Luckily, they had upgraded their car reservation the night before from a Ford Focus to Pontiac Intrigue. (Yeah, I know, &#8220;upgrade&#8221; is subjective. Simple fact: the Intrigue is bigger. Hence, more room to store all the stuff they had.) By 2:30, they had all the things they needed, had seen a bit of Calgary, and were ready to head into the mountains.<br />
I spent the rest of the day watching TV and movies. I felt a complete lack of desire to go outside.<br />
Sunday morning, met up with Kaz for dim sum. She had called me a couple days earlier interested in going for dim sum, if there was a party going. I had some difficulty raising anyone else (turned out to be a case of missing people), so it ended up just being Kaz and myself.<br />
A first note on dim sum for two: Can&#8217;t be done, especially if you know what you&#8217;re getting and have been with large groups. Both Kaz and I overate. But it was all good &#8212; I didn&#8217;t eat again until much later.<br />
Going to dim sum with Kaz was a little uncomfortable. It was just me, so I lacked the &#8220;safety in numbers&#8221;. I know this sounds strange, but look at it this way: I was out with my best friend&#8217;s fiancée, while my best friend is half-way around the world. It&#8217;s a little disconcerting, and only because I&#8217;m still getting to know her, and she&#8217;s getting to know me. But by the end, I was feeling much better &#8212; I think it&#8217;s just a case of finding ground on my own. (Previously, Chris had always been around.) One thing the dim sum did give us was a chance to talk. There were a few things Kaz needed to know, not only about Chris, but about the rest of us, too. Barring a change in plans, Kaz will become Chris&#8217; wife, and therefore someone who&#8217;ll need to know who we are.<br />
After dim sum, I wandered about downtown for a while, but ended up at home. Watching TV. And movies.<br />
Luckily, I was rescued by Stuart and Therese, who invited me over for the first barbecue of the season, and to watch the final episode of the X-Files. The three of us (and often with Chris) had watched the X-Files religiously for years &#8212; often in our parents&#8217; basements when were in Oakville, with my travelling to Guelph a few times to watch season premieres (and finales) when we were in university, and sharing stories and theories during the summer breaks. But no more, except in reruns.<br />
Today was &#8230; pretty much a nothing day. I needed to come in to work, but couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it. I forced myself outside for a couple of hours, but soon found myself wanting to go home again. It was a warm day, but hazy &#8230; the Weather Network put it down as &#8220;smoke&#8221;, but from what I don&#8217;t know &#8212; the mountains are still thawing out.<br />
Another week is underway, and it brings me another week closer to changing my life. I, for one, can&#8217;t wait.</p>

It&#8217;s had more than its fair share of ups and downs, but it&#8217;s not what I would call a &#8220;bad&#8221; year (events of 11 September notwithstanding, of course).<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not since Kathryn returned to Toronto have I had some time off. I&#8217;ve been a busy little beaver, cutting down on the amount of work that&#8217;s been heaped on me in the past few weeks and months. So it goes without saying that one can get a little tired.<br />
I had planned to go in this weekend and try to work out more of the reports I&#8217;m working on. I came in early Saturday afternoon, and promptly accomplished nothing. Every word I typed, I erased. It was one of those days where nothing made sense, and every sentence only succeeded in detrimenting the entire report. A sure sign of exhaustion. So when Cory (my department head) suggested an evening out to relax, it seemed like a really good idea.<br />
Four of us from Web Development (Cory, Dennis, Shawn, and yours truly) along with one Designer (Neil, who regularly hangs out with Dennis and Shawn) found our way down to Chinook Bowling. Neil drove, which was a little odd, since it was almost impossible to see out Neil&#8217;s windows (they were a little foggy and dirty), and he wasn&#8217;t entirely sure of where the alley was. He kept saying that it was a bit of an &#8220;odd&#8221; door, but that he&#8217;d recognize it &#8212; a key thing because (according to Neil), there was no sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found the door.<br />
Right under a large red sign that said &#8220;bowling&#8221;.<br />
We found, a bit to our chagrin, that we&#8217;d walked into a five-pin bowlerama, instead of the 10-pin, which I think we&#8217;d actually been hoping for. I don&#8217;t think we cared too much. Sure, some consider five-pin to be a retarded way to play &#8230; but they don&#8217;t play it the way we did.<br />
I should quickly detail the setting. Like most mall bowling alleys, it was in a basement. Built in the late 60s, it had received some more recent technology (computerized scoring, new lighting), but it was otherwise unchanged since it opened &#8230; including the shoes. (They are, I think, the worst shoes I&#8217;ve ever had to use. Which of course makes the experience all that much better.) The alley was packed with people, though I&#8217;m pretty sure we were among the oldest there. Certainly we were one of a small handful who had beer.<br />
Only moments after arriving, Cory&#8217;s name was called, indicating that a lane was now open. We hurried on with our shoes and headed directly for the awaiting lane. Our names were already entered into the computer system, appearing on the monitor above our lane. The five lonely pins glowed a purply tinge way off in the distance.<br />
Glowed? Oh yeah, missed that detail &#8212; it was glow in the dark bowling. Although the only thing that really glowed were the pins. The balls were they typical mottled black spheres. It&#8217;s probably a good thing they didn&#8217;t glow &#8212; if the staff had seen what we were doing with them, we&#8217;d have been kicked out before the end of the first game.<br />
I can actually remember the last time I went bowling &#8212; 5 December 1999 (see [[How to Throw a Surprise Party]]). My ex&#8217;s birthday. I had thrown her a surprise party (which had nearly given me an ulcer from the stress), and it had ultimately ended up in the Commodore Lanes. No glow bowl, though.<br />
I&#8217;ve noticed two things about my bowling ability. First, it seems to get better after a beer or two (although more than that has a severely inverse affect). Second, and this is the really bizarre one, I bowl better in the dark. I&#8217;ll never figure that one out&#8230;<br />
It took only a frame before Neil decided that our names weren&#8217;t right. So he took the liberty of changing them, usually when that particular person was up to roll. We went through many name changes, but I cannot really tell you what the final names we ended up with were. Not because I don&#8217;t remember (because I do), and not because they used objectionable words (otherwise we certainly would have been kicked out), but because the terms are &#8230; well &#8230; they carry certain meanings which I&#8217;d prefer not to have to explain.<br />
Not to mention that I don&#8217;t entirely understand them myself.<br />
My first game was off to a slow start (they usually do). But after a few throws, I began to remember how to throw a five-pin ball, and managed to sneak out in front by the time the round was over. The second game went completely to pot, and everyone but Cory and myself were trying new and unusual (and probably illegal in a few states) throws. For example, both Dennis and Shawn tried to throw the balls like you would in a baseball or softball game, though making sure that the ball didn&#8217;t bounce too hard. Dennis&#8217; most profound shot went directly into the gutter, but then ricocheted out, and managed to knock down the right two pins. For a couple of throws, Neil didn&#8217;t even get out of his chair, but opted to throw the ball from the bench. His accuracy wasn&#8217;t too bad, admittedly. I managed to win that round too, with a pitiful 165.<br />
Cory suggested that we attempt to get serious for our third game, but it&#8217;s hard to be serious when you have a hard time walking in a straight line. My game utterly fell apart, and was barely able to cross 100. I might have done better had we not run out of time on the game &#8230; and if the lights hadn&#8217;t come back on. Once I was able to see where I was throwing, my aim went totally off. Go figure. Cory won with a 188.<br />
Opting to leave the alley (being the only ones left, our rather unusual bowling styles were attracting a lot of attention), we headed over to Kensington for a post-game snack, and to discuss the future of our newly-formed bowling team &#8212; The Steamers (and no, I&#8217;m not telling you the full name). Neil, Dennis, and I made light of our short journey by singing Wayne Newton&#8217;s &#8220;Danke Schoen&#8221; at the top of our lungs, particularly when we managed to pull  up next to Cory&#8217;s truck. You can only imagine what it must have been like to have three mildly inebriated 20-somethings (barely) harmonizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>I recall Central Park in fall,<br />
how you tore your dress,<br />
what a mess,<br />
I confess&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I paid for it the following morning, and most of day. But you&#8217;d be surprised how much a good bout of dim sum can take the edge off a hangover (albeit a mild one). Even then, though, I didn&#8217;t feel decent until around 6pm that night, when the Academy Awards hit the airwaves.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably wondering what I thought of them. (And even if you&#8217;re not, I&#8217;m telling you anyway.) This was a tough year for the Academy. Lots of really crappy movies means that only a handful are good enough to even consider, which means that the criteria between all the movies isn&#8217;t easy. Okay, so let&#8217;s look at the ones I had problems with (you can assume I agreed with the rest):<br />
Best Supporting Actor: Benicio Del Toro (Traffic)<br />
Okay, this isn&#8217;t so much a problem as I wanted Willem Dafoe to win for Shadow of the Vampire. Although the movie itself wasn&#8217;t worth nominating, his performance saved it from being a waste of celluloid. Were it up to me, I would have picked Dafoe.<br />
Best Actress: Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich)<br />
Yes, she&#8217;s attractive. Yes, she can act a million times better than her brother, Eric. But did she really deserve it? Well, there&#8217;s the $30 million dollar question (which is, ironically enough, probably what she&#8217;s gonna start asking for). Now, admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen Erin Brockovich, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a good movie. (I&#8217;ve seen enough clips.) However, this is Julia Roberts we&#8217;re talking about. Both Chris and I have extreme reservations when it comes to her winning over performances such as Ellen Burstyn (Requiem For A Dream) who was utterly astounding, or even Bjork (Dancer In The Dark), who wasn&#8217;t even nominated for an Oscar! So why did Julia win? It was &#8220;her year&#8221;. She&#8217;s paid her dues, regardless of the talent of others. (Yeah, I sound a little bitter. I&#8217;m annoyed that the Academy still seems to work this way.)<br />
Best Actor: Russell Crowe (Gladiator)<br />
Okay, yes, he did an excellent performance, and he is a good actor. But I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it was all the lobbying that got him the award. I&#8217;ve heard amazing reviews of Ed Harris&#8217; performance in Pollock, which to me looks more worthy. Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t seen it, so this is mostly just me wondering about Hollywood. Not so much as with Best Picture, though.<br />
Best Director: Steven Soderbergh (Traffic)<br />
Steve&#8217;s a good director, I&#8217;ll give him that. And certainly with two nominations, he certainly upped his chances. But when you look at Traffic and compare it with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (I&#8217;m gonna abbreviate it to CTHD, &#8216;cuz it&#8217;s a lot to type), there isn&#8217;t much of a contest. The goal of a director is to provide the coordination and overall feeling for the movie. I&#8217;m sure Steve had a lot to do with that. But two things: 1) Traffic was based on a British series of the same name, so ol&#8217; Stevie had something existing to work with. 2) When it comes to having to manage sheer complexity, and being an utter nit-pick to get the scene just right, you can&#8217;t beat the tenacity that Ang Lee showed. (I know, because I read about it.) So yeah, I don&#8217;t agree with this one.<br />
Best Picture: Gladiator<br />
Wow. What a surprise. I think Chris and I both knew that Hollywood still wasn&#8217;t quite ready to choose a movie like CTHD as its best of the year. Disappointing in a way &#8212; CTHD embodied most of what movie-making has tried to create. That&#8217;s not to reduce Gladiator&#8217;s success even in the slightest &#8212; it, too, did an excellent job. But with both Life Is Beautiful and CTHD being nominated for Best Picture awards, maybe the future holds a more global view than the typical American fare.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been one of those years. I really hope I don&#8217;t have to go through another one like that again. Clichéd though it be, it was a year for rediscovery &#8212; mostly of myself. I lost my self-identity in Vancouver, allowing myself to be overwhelmed by another. It takes a while to rebuild that sort of thing. It&#8217;s not done yet, but having gone through that I know now what to avoid should I ever be so stupid as to get myself into that situation again&#8230;<br />
