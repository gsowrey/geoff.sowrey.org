		<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading this site for any length of time, you&#8217;ve probably come across a <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/category/rants/">rant or two of mine</a> about all the garbage surrounding things like [[Disbelieving DRM and copy protection|DRM]] and the [[What is that irritating whine?|MPAA saying stupid things]].<br />

		<p>In a previous life, I worked for <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/category/radical-entertainment/">Radical Entertainment</a>, maker of video games. Very fun company, very fun job. Well, when I wasn&#8217;t writing technical documents, which is about the most <em>boring</em> job I think I&#8217;ve ever done.<br />
Even though it&#8217;s been almost 7.5 years, I do still miss working there. But I know that today, Radical&#8217;s a very different place.<br />

		<p>Some of you might have already seen the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10akflzdwVs">Audi commercial</a>. Pretty neat.<br />
Even neater, when it comes right down to it, is the guy who thought of this in the first place. (I&#8217;m not certain, but I think he&#8217;s also in the Audi commercial at the beginning.)<br />
Watch him <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFr60mcYxM">play Mozart on roller skates</a>. This is creative thinking! (Although the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYjSe8vSrt0&amp;NR=1">making of the Audi commercial</a> is pretty cool, too.)</p>

No, this is not about copying the <em>Star Wars </em>movies. So if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for, please look elsewhere. This is about two great movies trilogies.<br />

		<p>One of my co-workers, Chrissie, pointed this out. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://dna.imagini.net/friends/">VisualDNA</a>.<br />
The basic premise is that you go through about 10 screens of images, each of which are geared towards how you perceive something specific to you, such as what you consider gross (smoking), your idea of landscape (old world white buildings on a green hillside), or what represents your idea of freedom (a passport so I can go places). All of this combines together in your VisualDNA profile.<br />

Aside from CTV&#8217;s crappy initial signal, this was worth watching. While I miss Billy Crystal as host, Ellen DeGeneres wasn&#8217;t too shabby. Some of the jokes were a little forced, but then that&#8217;s her style and she makes it work.<br />

		<p>Last night, we attended what I can only describe as a typical Maritime house/kitchen party. Except without the screech or incomprehensible accents.<br />
Back in the early 1990s, Canada had a brief flirtation with popular Maritime music. While the Maritimes loved the music to begin with, the rest of us uncultured folk had to wait for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_content">CanCon rules</a> to bring it into the public eye.<br />
Along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leahy">Leahy</a> (who hit the big scene a couple of years earlier) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Big_Sea">Great Big Sea</a> (who rolled in with the tide a couple of years later), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rankins">The Rankin Family</a> made up a significant portion of the Maritime component of the Canadian airwaves.<br />
I&#8217;d heard one or two of their tunes before. Nice, but I didn&#8217;t go out of my way to buy an album.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in August, Alex and I celebrated our paper anniversary, the first. We&#8217;d celebrated by going to Banff and spending the night at the Banff Springs hotel, having a wonderful dinner (note: chocolate fondue is wonderful, but uncomfortably filling), and attending the Mozart on the Mountain concert in Canmore.<br />
As part of our paper anniversary, I gave Alex tickets (paper) to the next Cirque du Soliel show, called Delirium.<br />
We&#8217;ve seen Cirque before in Calgary, earlier when we were dating (see [[Stampede Breakfast, Topmade Barbecue, and Quidam]]). I&#8217;ve also seen Cirque in Vegas (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Touring Las Vegas and Cirque du Soleil Mystére]]) and a couple of other minor times (and off-shoot troupes) in and around Ontario. In short, there was no reason not to get good tickets the moment they went on sale.<br />
The kicker was that Alex knew that Cirque was coming, and kept bugging me to get tickets. I stalled repeatedly and played stupid (I do it rather well, admittedly; comes from being naturally idiotic) and managed to keep her unaware that the tickets were, in fact, already purchased. So when the time came, it was a wonderful little surprise.<br />
We had good seats. Not floor, but really darn close. Close enough that we could almost hear people on the stage (I thought I could, but given the clarity of the sound system it was sometimes hard to tell).<br />
It was a weird show, unlike any previous Cirque show I&#8217;ve seen. This could largely be due to Franco Dragoni having left to do his own thing, and his protégés having taken over. The stage was long and thin, with &#8220;backstages&#8221; on either end. The entire stage couldn&#8217;t have been more than about six metres wide. Each side could be &#8220;draped&#8221; with a long curtain, which was translucent. You could see through the curtains to the other side. This gave a more ethereal look and allowed for projection onto the stage environment.<br />
The show was far more musical than previous shows, and made even less sense than Cirque shows usually make. (Yes, it&#8217;s about the power of dream and imagination, a common theme, but I was still scratching my head to make out some sort of overall plot device.)<br />
The first act was a solo singer who performed with members of the Cirque troupe. It&#8217;s hard to pin down the style (other than being Cirque-like) using Gaelic and Arabic lyrics, by the sounds of it. Active, invigorating, and sold us on a CD during the intermission.<br />
The main show started shortly thereafter. Lots of acrobatics, drums, strange instruments, people hanging from the rafters and a weirdo on stilts (again, typically Cirque). The neat thing was all the video that is shown on the screens that drift across the stagefront every so often.<br />
But no clowns.<br />
Overall, totally worth the price of admission. I love Cirque du Soliel. They&#8217;re always worth watching, even if it&#8217;s not one of their big, extravagant Vegas shows.<br />
Hmm. Which reminds me. I do need to revisit Vegas sometime to catch the other shows I haven&#8217;t seen&#8230;</p>

		<p>Space. The Final Frontier.<br />
Forty years ago today, a little under six years before I was born, Star Trek took to the air for it&#8217;s original three-year run before being cancelled. It would spawn off an animated series, comic book series, toys, four spin-off television series, 10 movies, and more parodies than you could shake a tribble at.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t know the first time I watched Star Trek in any form, though I&#8217;m relatively sure it was TOS (The Original Series). I know I was an addict for the entire run of TNG (The Next Generation). From there, I progressed to DS9 (Deep Space 9), Voyager, and finally the too-short-lived Enterprise series. Following TNG, my addition tempered and waned, especially as many of the episodes seemed to have lacklustre writing and stints of not-so-great acting. (Yes, it can be argued that none of the series had great acting as a whole. Particularly when it comes to asking what &#8230; have you done &#8230; with &#8230; Spock&#8217;s brain?!)<br />
&#8220;Trekkie.&#8221; The word evokes four possible responses: Laughter, ignorance, revulsion, acceptance. Some know what a trekkie is and merely laugh at the idea. There are those who have no idea what a trekkie is. There are those who do know and thoroughly object to being considered a &#8220;trekkie&#8221;, staunchly preferring &#8220;trekker&#8221;. And there are those who like the idea (and the connotations) that come with the epithet.<br />
I was a trekkie. (Note the past-tense.) I considered those who wanted to be called &#8220;trekkers&#8221; to be far too pretentious for their own good. I was all for the campiness, the humour, the perceived silliness that comes out. I went to Star Trek conventions (two, to be exact &#8212; one in Toronto and another in Buffalo). I had the pins, knew most of the characters, all the TNG episodes, could recite most of The Wrath of Khan by heart. And I wasn&#8217;t ashamed about it, either.<br />
Somewhere along the line &#8212; once I&#8217;d graduated university, it seems &#8212; I&#8217;d began a long, slow decline in my trekkiness. Today, I&#8217;d consider myself having turned my card back, no longer allowed to consider myself one amongst the crowd. &#8220;Reformed&#8221;, &#8220;ex&#8221;, &#8220;former&#8221; &#8212; pick a euphimism. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still love Star Trek in its various forms (although Voyager&#8217;s &#8220;reset button&#8221; habit still ticks me off), I just don&#8217;t devote a significant portion of my brain to it anymore. I&#8217;ve got a variety of other things to cram in there.<br />
Like generally useless trivia. It&#8217;s part of being a know-it-all.<br />
But you have to give Star Trek something. Despite all the wacky behaviour with fanatics, the show has done a surprising amount of good. Well, maybe &#8220;good&#8221; is subjective. It breathed life into the entire nearly-dead science fiction genre and gave rise to Star Wars, among other things. It also kindled new interest in science itself, creating several generations of scientists, physicists, explorers, and astronomers.<br />
The creator is gone. Gene Roddenbury died when I was in university. DeForrest &#8220;Bones&#8221; Kelly followed a few years later. James &#8220;Scotty&#8221; Doohan passed into the final frontier last year. Forty years takes its toll. They may be gone, but the legacy will live on. Maybe even to the 23rd century.<br />
Live long, and prosper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Not long after I met Alex, I was introduced to The Vinyl Cafe. This is a weekly show on CBC Radio, featuring the short stories of author and host Stuart McLean. It&#8217;s a wonderful show, and I try to listen to it as much as possible. With the weekly visits to the Calgary Farmer&#8217;s Market as of late however, I miss the show more often than I hear it.<br />
The Vinyl Cafe is the name not only of the radio show, but also of the fictional store run by Stuart&#8217;s protagonist, Dave. Most of Stuart&#8217;s stories revolve around Dave and his family: wife Morley, daughter Stephanie, and son Sam. Not to mention most of their neighbours, friends, and relatives. The stories take place over many decades, going back to Dave&#8217;s childhood. There are a lot of stories to be heard, such as Dave&#8217;s experience cooking the Christmas turkey or Sam believing his mother is a shoplifter. Most of them are a tremendous mix of hilarity and seriousness. Some will put extreme strain on your bladder, others a tear to your eye.<br />
Stuart is more than just a gifted story teller. He&#8217;s a music geek. This is very clear from the way he writes his stories that involve Dave and his love of music. It&#8217;s not popular music, it&#8217;s good music &#8212; great music. Music that I&#8217;ve rarely heard of. This love of music extends beyond his story-telling, and into his radio shows.<br />
Except for the rare occasions where the show is done from a CBC studio, most of the Vinyl Cafe shows are recorded live in front of an audience. The shows are held across Canada on a series of tours. Stuart doesn&#8217;t do the show alone &#8212; though he could, if he needed to. Stuart&#8217;s love of music brings along mostly-unknown musicians to perform in between story tellings. (And even perform in some of the stories.)<br />
I&#8217;ve seen the Vinyl Cafe live once before, at the Jubilee Theatre here in Calgary. It was the Vinyl Cafe Christmas show. It was my first introduction to the joy of seeing the radio show done live. (The Calgary show might have been recorded, but wasn&#8217;t the one broadcast. From what I gather, the shows sometimes have to be edited to account for things like flubs while reading the stories. The live shows are quite a bit longer than the radio shows (two hours vs. one hour).<br />
Tonight, the Vinyl Cafe came to the Banff (Bamf!) Centre. Not exactly a local venue for Calgary, but it&#8217;s worth the drive. Stuart brought his regular musicians John Sheard and the bassist (whose name I sadly cannot remember). They back him up during the various segments of the show, such as the Story Exchange. John and Stuart usually also throw in a song and dance at the end, which is usually current news and politics thrown into a half-song, half-rap.<br />
Stuart also brought along long-time Vinyl Cafe performer Suzie Vinnick as one of the two featured musicians, the other being newcomer Reid Jamieson. They came and went as Stuart weaved the stories of the evening. They also participated in a classic radio show recreation &#8230; one written by Stuart to be like the shows of yore, the ones who grew up with.<br />
Front row centre seats. Pure fluke that I happened to get them. So close you could almost have received some of Stuart&#8217;s spittle when he got really animated. Which was most of the time. Stuart doesn&#8217;t just read &#8212; he performs. The story sits on a music stand, as Stuart&#8217;s arms fly about in all directions, sometimes adding to the story and sometimes just there. He reads exceptionally, adding levels of inflection and emphasis that one can only guess at if you&#8217;re only reading the story. Hearing it adds that extra level of meaning not normally present. (And for some reason, that includes Southern Albertans getting most of his innuendos. &#8220;They didn&#8217;t laugh at that in Ft. McMurray!&#8221;)<br />
The shows are never long enough. A couple of stories of Dave and Morley, a Story Exchange, and Stuart&#8217;s radio show about Eggs Blackiron (complete with a basket of egg jokes). Soon it was all over, and all there was left was to go home. But rest assured that Stuart won&#8217;t be able to come back this way without me knowing about it, and I will be back. For there is always a reason to see the Vinyl Cafe.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>You could almost have called last night&#8217;s telecast &#8220;The George Clooney Show&#8221;. That man attracts far too much attention for being only one person in Hollywood.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that he doesn&#8217;t deserve attention, but come on&#8230;<br />
I have to admit, I wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled to hear that Jon Stewart was going to host the Oscars. This is an event where the right person can do a spectacular job. Witness the years Billy Crystal and Steve Martin have hosted. The wrong person turns it into a complete fiasco, and you really wonder where the hell it&#8217;s all going. Witness David Letterman.<br />
Despite missing most of the red carpet show (thankfully, no real fashion accidents this year &#8212; though I do have to say that&#8217;s most of the reason I watch that segment, anyway), I sat down with my ear-to-ear grin to watch the show. It started a little differently than previous years. In lieu of reviewing the movies that had come out and were nominated (as Crystal is oft to do in song), it was a recap of the hosts over the last ten or so years, all explaining why they couldn&#8217;t host. The nearest any of them really got to any one movie were the first two: Billy Crystal and Chris Rock, in a tent in a lush valley in the mountains. Both were &#8220;busy&#8221;.<br />
Ironically enough, the funniest one was David Letterman, who claimed he couldn&#8217;t do it as he was watching over Steve Martin&#8217;s kids, so they wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;grow up funny&#8221;. (Steve had delivered the joke a couple of people earlier. The kids &#8212; and a dog &#8212; wore wigs reminiscent of Steve&#8217;s own white locks.)<br />
Jon Stewart woke up from a dream, believing that he was asked to host the Oscars. Only to find himself in bed with Halle Berry. Another dream. When he reawoke, it was George Clooney. Not a dream. Sorta. Clooney didn&#8217;t really seem to be enjoying himself on that one, admittedly. But it wouldn&#8217;t be the last time that evening.<br />
Most of the segments in the show were obviously due to Jon Stewart&#8217;s Emmy award-winning writing team. (The faux mudslinging ads for best actress and best sound mixing, modelled after the well-understood and well-used paradigm of political ads during election campaigns.)<br />
There were a couple of slip-ups during the presentations. Morgan Freeman flubbed a line. Lauren Bacall, out to introduce the timeless film noire segment, had extreme difficulty with her lines &#8212; almost to the point where I thought she was going to give up and leave the stage. But she&#8217;s a quintessential performer, and got herself back on track to a complete finish. (My guess? The teleprompter ran too quickly.)<br />
Yes, the Academy Awards are completely insular. They&#8217;re a reflection of Hollywood&#8217;s self-congratulatory nature, and really have no bearing on any dose of reality outside of the Los Angeles area. So what? It&#8217;s a chance to escape into something completely unnecessary, and watch famous people get jealous on each other.<br />
It&#8217;s also a chance to watch some interesting turns of event. While there was no surprise that &#8220;Wallace and Grommit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#8221; won for Best Animated Feature, nor that &#8220;March of the Penguins&#8221; walked away with Best Full-Length Documentary, there were a few surprises. I hadn&#8217;t expected Reese Witherspoon to snap up Best Actress. Judi Dench, certainly, but not Reese. I&#8217;m not suggesting that she&#8217;s not worthy of the nod, but I wonder what exceedingly minor role Dame Judi will win Best Supporting Actress for next year. Ang Lee wasn&#8217;t a surprise per se, but the competition was stiff. Philip Seymour Hoffman for Best Actor? Not completely surprising &#8212; he&#8217;s an outstanding actor &#8212; but my money was on Brokeback&#8217;s Heath Ledger.<br />
Which does bring up an interesting point: &#8220;Brokeback Mountain&#8221; didn&#8217;t do nearly as well as the buzz suggested. Sure, the buzz is non-binding, but when you consider that the buzz had got to come from <em>somewhere</em>, there much be an iota of truth in it, right? I&#8217;m sure the theme to Brokeback will haunt me for years to come, much as the theme from &#8220;Shakespeare in Love&#8221; still does.<br />
The broadcast kept to schedule, and finished on time &#8212; even a little early (by a couple of minutes, anyway). It wasn&#8217;t the best Oscar show I&#8217;ve ever seen, but it was far from the worst. And Jon Stewart? I think he could successfully host again. Once he got into his groove, he was an able host. Not as much an insider as Billy Crystal, and certainly not a lyrical, but at least he doesn&#8217;t try &#8220;Uma, Oprah&#8221; jokes.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I am a know-it-all. Both in the best and worst senses.<br />
I became one as a kid. When all of my friends were reading Hardy Boys or Lord of the Rings, I was reading through Time Life books, learning how the universe worked &#8212; from the formation of suns right down to the reproductive systems in humans.<br />
That was Mom&#8217;s doing, actually. She knew two things of my behaviour. First, that I read a lot. If we&#8217;d had the Encyclopedia Britannica, I would have read the whole thing, cover to cover. It&#8217;s probably a good thing that we didn&#8217;t, actually. The other thing was that I was nosey. I knew most of Mom&#8217;s good hiding spots for presents. (I&#8217;m sure Mom had a few others that I hadn&#8217;t even considered.) That was how Mom managed to sneak in a book that she was sure I would read.<br />
The human body made up as robots, all geared to explain sexual reproduction to kids. Sounds like a weird concept. The first time that I read the book, it didn&#8217;t sink in. Something just didn&#8217;t make sense. When I reread the book a few months later (Mom had since then removed the book from the &#8220;hiding&#8221; place to the bookshelf), it stuck. It didn&#8217;t fit with my world view at the time, so required some additional processing.<br />
My appetite for information, however, didn&#8217;t waiver. Mom got me another set of books &#8212; Time Life again &#8212; on Planet Earth. This covered pretty much every angle of Earth&#8217;s formation, behaviour, the things that make it up, and the things that live on it. Given that it&#8217;s Time Life, it&#8217;s not super-detailed, but it allowed me to get a decent grasp on plate tectonics.<br />
In Grade Eight.<br />
My English teacher believed that my parents had written the report rather than myself. At the time, I hadn&#8217;t understood the accusation, but would later realize what she was getting at.<br />
Jeopardy bored me. My family had a habit of watching Wheel of Fortune (which I couldn&#8217;t stand, then or now) and Jeopardy over dinner. If I didn&#8217;t &#8220;win&#8221; the episode, I often came darn close. The Teen and College editions were laughable.<br />
In university, I made it a habit of taking a variety of courses &#8212; for interests&#8217; sake. I went in for Computer Science, came out with an English degree, and took courses from nearly every faculty along the way. Some because I needed courses other than my core ones, but others because they looked interesting. And I learned a lot.<br />
The internet has been my biggest provider, despite the risk of inaccurate (or completely false) information that is sometimes to be found there. The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> is my latest obsession, and I regularly find myself consciously steering clear of it so I don&#8217;t become completely absorbed. That, combined with my 70 or so RSS feeds do a pretty decent job of filling my head full of often-useless crap.<br />
And believe me, I keep it pretty full. It got so full that I eventually reached &#8220;informational mass&#8221;, the point at which a person is no longer able to keep this information bottled up and feels the urge to share it with everyone else. Often at annoying or poorly coordinated times. I became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Claven">Cliff Claven</a>.<br />
Yes, my friends have called me that. To my face. In front of my family. Several times.<br />
I can&#8217;t help it! I&#8217;m sure that psychiatry would be well-motivated to investigate this mental illness if they knew how many people are afflicted with know-it-all-ism. Just imagine how many people must require treatment for the sake of their sanity, their marriages, or even their jobs!<br />
My job has been both a blessing and a curse for my know-it-all-ism. It requires me to know a lot to enable decision making, and affords me the chance to offer up information to help others. However, it means that I&#8217;ll frequently offer information that has nothing to do with the work at hand &#8230; such as the specific date the Romanov family was assassinated (16 July 1918) and that Anastasia didn&#8217;t survive as myth sometimes suggests.<br />
One of my ex-project managers, Nancy, even called me on one of my factoids:</p>
<blockquote><p>Geoff, do you actually know that, or do you just make yourself out to sound like you know?</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>The best part is that you&#8217;ll never know for sure.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s the key to being a know-it-all: confidence. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you know something or not. You could be completely wrong about it. But you have to sound like you&#8217;re right, completely and without the possibility of fault. So long as someone is convinced that you know what you&#8217;re talking about (even if you&#8217;re way off), then you&#8217;re a trusted source.<br />
Oh, and you have to speak your mind. Often out-of-turn. When no-one asked for it. That&#8217;s also a defining point of a know-it-all.<br />
Take the case of <a href="http://ajjacobs.com/">A.J. Jacobs</a>, for example. He dedicated himself to the task of reading the Encyclopedia Britannica end-to-end under the guise of becoming the smartest person in the world. And then <a href="http://ajjacobs.com/content/book.asp">he wrote a book about the journey</a>.<br />
I mention this because I&#8217;m reading the book. I&#8217;m only up to P, but so far it&#8217;s been a great book. Especially for me since I really identify with A.J. Or should that be sympathize? Well, I suppose it works both ways. It&#8217;s a great read, though. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s for everyone, mind you, since you need to be a bit of a know-it-all to fully appreciate its humour.<br />
Even A.J., having read the Britannica, admits that you can&#8217;t know everything, and a lot of what you &#8220;know&#8221; depends on how well you can convince others. Take his brother-in-law, Eric, who tried to convince his own wife that a waitress serving them was not from a small town hear where his wife was raised, but in Eastern Europe. Needless to say, A.J. was quite pleased when Eric go trounced. And A.J. learned the secret of being a know-it-all.<br />
I try to manage my dissemination of knowledge, but I know full well that I periodically still sound like Cliff. Without the accent, that is. Or the postal carrier outfit.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not a Roman Catholic. However, I will mourn the passing of Pope John Paul II.<br />
From a religious perspective, John Paul II had no direct influence on my life. John Paul II did not draw the line at religious direction. He was the first pope of the modern era of technology and communications. He instituted more ways of communicating to the world than any other pope before him. He was a global pope &#8212; a global personality.<br />
Within months of his election, he went home to then-communist Poland. Depending on who you ask, he either ruffled the feathers of the Soviet elite, or he helped contribute in a large way to the fall of the Soviet Union. He caused a calm revolution.<br />
Pope John Paul II&#8217;s influence extended around the world, and he visited more countries during his 26 years than any other pope before him, or any world leader ever could.<br />
While I didn&#8217;t entirely agree with Pope John Paul II&#8217;s views, specifically the ones on homosexuality, I cannot argue with all the things he did for the world. He might have done more good for the world through encouraging peace and negotiating than any other person &#8230; or organization, for that matter.<br />
In a little over two weeks, a new Pope will be elected in Conclave. Whoever it is that ascends to the Throne of St. Peter will have a great deal to live up to. The challenge has been set before him, and the world awaits to see if he&#8217;s up for it.<br />
For now, though, the world will continue to mourn John Paul II&#8217;s passing. Pope or not, he was a large influence on the world, and the loss of an influence that large is not easily dismissed.</p>

		<p>2004 wasn&#8217;t exactly what I&#8217;d call a tumultuous year, but it was certainly marked with some pretty big events for me, not the least of which was meeting Alex. If there was a number one in the list, she would be it. 2005 is already looking to be an interesting year, since there are a lot of things that will be happening for me.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><strong>WARNING!</strong> <em>The following entry contains language that might not be appropriate to some. If you are offended easily by some words, I recommend skipping this entry. If you continue to read it, and are offended, your damn funeral!</em><br />
I&#8217;ve listened to George Carlin since I was a beginning teenager. Back then, he was the funniest thing I&#8217;d ever heard. Guess what? He still is.<br />
Tonight, George Carlin came to Calgary, and played the Jack Singer Hall. He certainly has a way of attracting a large crowd. There were exceedingly few empty seats, which just shows his drawing power.<br />
George started out in comedy in the 1950s as a clean cut, well-dressed comedian. He had a show that played well, and was attended by the well to-do of the time. After a while, however, that didn&#8217;t really sit with him. It wasn&#8217;t his thing. He was playing to his parents, not his generation.<br />
This is how he came up with the Seven Words You Can&#8217;t Say On Television: shit, piss, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.<br />
(Offended yet?)<br />
This is what sent George down a significantly different road than most comics at the time. In some ways, he could be thought of as an original &#8220;bad guy&#8221; of comedy. He forever stepped away from the good side, and made sure that the boat would never stop rocking.<br />
George is an observationalist. That&#8217;s what makes him so funny. He doesn&#8217;t invent stories, he doesn&#8217;t create one-liners. He tells you the things you already know, but maybe just haven&#8217;t thought of it that way before.<br />
Take enemas, for example. Not the most pleasant of topics, are they? Well, consider this: you know what they are, you might even know someone who&#8217;s had one. But someone, probably a guy (according to Carlin), thought of it first. Imagine that moment.<br />
George started off his session with a rapid-fire monologue of what he is. I can&#8217;t even begin to describe it, let alone repeat it, and do it any remote point of justice. It was, however, amazing.<br />
He then commented on how he was preparing for his 13th HBO special, and had a few things that he needed to rearrange to make the show be zippy. It was almost like hearing your grandfather (Carlin is 67, by the way) natter away about something very trivial. I was worried. I was thinking that this might end up being a really lousy show&#8230;<br />
&#8220;You know what people don&#8217;t talk about in public anymore? Pussy farts!&#8221;<br />
George Carlin had officially entered the room. So began about a 90 minute barrage of swearing, unusual musings, several slanders against every race, sex, creed, religion, and belief (because, like I said, George loves rocking that boat), with barely a pause. He didn&#8217;t waste time, and despite a couple of low points, he got a lot of laughs.<br />
There were no encores, no curtain calls. He&#8217;s a simple guy who loves to turn the world on its ear for 90 minutes at a time. And that&#8217;s why people love to listen to George Carlin rant. Before there was Dennis Leary, before Eddie Murphy, before Father Guido Sarducci, there was Carlin.<br />
So to you George, thank you. Thank you for coming to Calgary and bringing us a live rendition of your views for us to hear. Thank you for being so blunt about the way things are, good or bad.<br />
And of course, thank you for fucking me up 20 years ago.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s just something inherently wrong with watching Stanley Cup hockey while sweating because it&#8217;s so warm. The season needs to be shorter.<br />
Or there need to be fewer teams, especially in places where you can&#8217;t naturally have ice outside. (But that&#8217;s just a personal gripe.)<br />
Last night was Game 5 in the Tampa Bay-Calgary Stanley Cup Final series. As is becoming a habit, Craig organized a gathering at the Rose and Crown, one of Calgary&#8217;s more popular watering holes. A former employee of the Rose, Craig was able to secure spaces on the third floor for us, so we&#8217;d have a place to sit and watch. Assuming we got there early enough to actually get a seat and not end up having to stand.<br />
Which of course meant that not only would the office be let out at 16:30 (it was for the last game), but I&#8217;d get stuck in an interview for a new Web Developer position until 16:50. I ended up jogging from the office (corner of 11th Ave. and 3rd St. SE) to the Rose (corner of 15th Ave. and 4th ST. SW) &#8212; a distance of about 11 blocks. All my gym excursions and healthy habits apparently have paid off &#8212; even with poor running shoes, I got there without feeling like I was going to have a heart attack.<br />
Many people sang along with Hockey Night in Canada&#8217;s opening theme, and with &#8220;O Canada&#8221;. But the cheering really didn&#8217;t kick in until the game got going. The series was tied at two games apiece, and both teams needed the advantage. Walking into Game 6 will either be staying alive or trying for the win, and it would better to be the latter.<br />
The volume in the bar was quite high &#8230; and we could barely hear the TVs. Everyone was yelling, shouting, cavorting, and several of us (Paul, Scott, Thelton, Keith, among others) were taking pictures of all the mayhem. Thelton was having particular fun emailing all the photos he&#8217;d taken with his cellphone immediately to the Calgary office email alias, to ensure that everyone arriving in the morning would see all the &#8220;glory&#8221;.<br />
I&#8217;m sure the patrons downstairs from us really came to despise the noisy folks on the top floor. We would stomp the floor rhythmically, chanting &#8220;Go Flames Go&#8221; as loud as we could. We would scream and yell whenever Calgary got close to Tampa Bay&#8217;s goal. The table of Cory, Chrissie, Michelle, Colin, Neil, Jason, Carl, and Julianne would chant about others in the room, for example: &#8220;Let&#8217;s go , let&#8217;s go!&#8221; until they either acknowledged the chant, or the chanters got bored and picked on someone else.<br />
The game itself was nerve-wracking. It was close. Calgary would score, then Tampa would score. It was tied when the clock ran out, and overtime began. I hate overtime. It&#8217;s such a toss-up. First goal wins, and you really get nervous when pucks get to close to your own goal. Luckily, Kiprusoff is a strong goalie, and Calgary&#8217;s defense was all over Tampa. And so it came down to the last five minutes of the first overtime period when Calgary finally popped the puck in.<br />
Total pandemonium.<br />
Within mere seconds, 17th Ave. was full of people, and traffic evacuated to the side streets. We weren&#8217;t far behind, though we had to do a couple of shots at the bar before we could get out the door. Then it was out to the Red Mile, and wandering in the direction of Melrose. The Red Sea had poured into the Red Mile.<br />
Unlike our previous ventures out onto 17th Ave. (see [[Calgary Flames win Western Conference]] and [[Calgary Flames and the 2004 Stanley Cup]]), this was a warm, dry evening, and was perfect fuel for the flashing fire. As you&#8217;ve no doubt heard (as most of North America has), Calgary&#8217;s Red Mile has turned into a &#8220;Girls Gone Wild&#8221; breast-fest of flashing. There&#8217;s websites devoted to this stuff. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll even be able to find videos in adult stores before too long (assuming, of course, that they&#8217;re not already there). It&#8217;s pretty weird, considering how this city is most of the year (save for Stampede, of course). You&#8217;d almost think we were in New Orleans or Mexico&#8230; Am I going to argue about it? No point, and no, it&#8217;s not because I want to encourage it. If people feel that liberated, all the power to them. I just hope that they consider some of the consequences.<br />
Angie got hoisted into the air on Thelton&#8217;s shoulders. Almost immediately, she was surrounded by a multitude of hormone- (and alcohol-) fuelled idiots, calling for Angie to remove her shirt. Angie, who has been known to do daring things in the past (and probably wouldn&#8217;t be objected from doing them under other circumstances) basically told them to grow up and take a hike, and returned to ground level.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay on 17th Ave. for too long, and started off in search of something else. For some reason, that was Cowboys, a bar just north of the railway tracks. After finding Angie&#8217;s car (she couldn&#8217;t quite remember where she&#8217;d parked), we wandered up 5th St., listening to the incoherent shouts above the cacaphony of car horns.<br />
When we arrived at Cowboys, I bade the others a good evening, as I headed home. Why? Simple reason: I have a moral objection to Cowboys. I do not wish to EVER enter an establishment whose waitstaff are known to have breast implants (rumoured to be paid by the bar&#8217;s owner), and over whose door there is a sign that reads: &#8220;Through these doors walk the most beautiful women in Alberta&#8221;. Thanks, but no thanks.<br />
I was quite tired when I finally got home. It was late, I was still a little inebriated, and I had to go to work the next day. One major advantage of having gone drinking with the group, though:<br />
You fall asleep fast.<br />

		<p>We all woke at about the same time. I was awake, though eyes closed, when I heard Tamara and Andrea whispering. I joined into the conversation, joined shortly thereafter by Dan. At that point, there wasn&#8217;t much reason to stay in bed, so I called first shower (I hadn&#8217;t had one since getting up &#8220;yesterday&#8221; in Japan).<br />
The plan had been to go for dim sum for breakfast, at the Chinese restaurant across the road. Not being open until 11:30 proved to be a bit of an issue, however, so we opted for breakfast #2: IHOP. Unlike Calgary, there is an International House of Pancakes in Kelowna. And we weren&#8217;t the only ones who knew that. The lineup was clearly out the door, and not just by a few people. It would be a long wait before we got breakfast if we&#8217;d stayed. We opted for the much shorter lineup at a nearby Perkins.<br />
It felt good to not eat Japanese for a change.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I don&#8217;t watch awards shows, as a whole. They&#8217;re mostly dull and boring. They feature people whom I don&#8217;t care about, and subjects that I couldn&#8217;t care less about.<br />
But then there&#8217;s the Academy Awards.<br />
I haven&#8217;t missed the Oscars since &#8230; well, since so long, I honesty can&#8217;t remember how old I was when I first saw the awards, but I&#8217;ve been addicted for years. Be it for Billy Crystal&#8217;s wit (Billy, please continue to do the show &#8212; you are without a doubt the best host since Bob Hope), or for the speeches, the surprises, the goofiness, it&#8217;s kept me captivated for years.<br />
This has been a hard year for the movie industry. Not only plagued with piracy on a public level, the industry has faced the loss of talent on a level that hasn&#8217;t been felt before on a such a level during my life. Unlike years previous, there were tributes specifically for two of the Academy&#8217;s greatest starts, Bob Hope and Kathryn Hepburn. But when the tribute to the rest of the stars came, there were names in there that forever changed the way we watch movies. It was far too many names to see lost within such a short period of time.<br />
The hard part of this is that the older I get, the more names I recognize. I suppose this is the way of things to come. The names in the future, I&#8217;ll know more often than not. One day, I&#8217;ll probably know them all. It&#8217;s almost like losing good friends, even if they&#8217;re ones I&#8217;ve never met.<br />
And once again, like last year, I need to thank the Academy for doing the right things. This year was not really a year of surprises. Pretty much everyone who was pegged to win, won. There were no real upsets, no surprises, no shockers. Okay, yes, that is a little boring. But it means that those responsible for voting didn&#8217;t make political decisions &#8212; they went with the right ones.<br />
Well, yes, the fact that Lord of the Rings swept every category could be construed as political, especially because it didn&#8217;t really win in previous years. But let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Let&#8217;s realize that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the most influential set of movies seen in the last decade. And nothing like that had ever been done before. The people nominated were those who&#8217;d worked on all three movies. Certainly there were other movies deserving of awards, but given the sheer scope of work, and the body that it represents, not to mention the quality of the final product, there is no question of who is deserving.<br />
Best Actor. Sean Penn. Perhaps I would have preferred Johnny Depp, but I can live with Sean Penn. There are a number of people who say he is the Marlon Brando of our age. With all due respect, Sean Penn is far more talented than that &#8212; I can actually stand to watch Penn&#8217;s performances.<br />
Best Actress. Haven&#8217;t seen Monster yet, but if Charlize Theron is willing to go that far for the sake of a role, then she&#8217;s deserves it.<br />
I could go on with the other awards, but let&#8217;s be honest. When Lord of the Rings wins all 11 of its nominations, there&#8217;s no reason to even bother mentioning the others. (Okay, maybe I should, but simply put, if you haven&#8217;t read about them, I&#8217;m not about to shed any light here &#8212; there&#8217;s plenty better places to see it all.)<br />
Thank you, AMPAS. Thank you for realizing that Lord of the Rings isn&#8217;t just a bunch of fantasy-obsessed teenage boys who need to see wizards. Thank you for seeing that it&#8217;s more than just some interesting words in a very long set of books. There is something powerful to this, and only a mind like Peter Jackson could bring it to life.<br />
And thank you for getting Billy Crystal back. Please make sure you keep up the good work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Tonight, David Bowie reminded us all how a concert should be done.<br />
Well, technically *last* night, but since it&#8217;s just after midnight as I write this, it&#8217;s still the same night. Anyway, you get the point.<br />
Tamara and I had planned this from several months ago (sometime in September or October), when we&#8217;d heard about an IMAX presentation of David Bowie&#8217;s new album, &#8220;Reality&#8221;. The two of us hussled down to the Paramount Chinook to score some tickets to watch the show. As it turned out, it was the best move we could make. As a result of that show, we&#8217;d found out that members of Bowie&#8217;s fan club had access to an Internet presale of tickets to his concert in Calgary.<br />
Within moments of getting home, Tamara had joined the club, and we had ordered tickets for us, Tamara&#8217;s parents, and a few of Tamara&#8217;s friends. But the choice tickets went to us.<br />
On the floor. In the eighth row. We&#8217;d be able to see Bowie&#8217;s *sweat*.<br />
Well, you can imagine the wait. It was long. Both of us wanted to see this show. For both Tamara and I, seeing David Bowie play is one of those (potentially) once-in-a-lifetime things. And unlike other acts who come and go, Bowie is a monolith in the industry &#8212; the one other acts look to. Elvis might have been the King, but it is the Thin White Duke who rules.<br />
The first time I&#8217;d heard David Bowie was in the early 80s. It was one song: &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;, from his &#8220;Let&#8217;s Dance&#8221; album. I don&#8217;t know what it was. Hook, line, and sinker. Since then, I&#8217;ve kept track of David&#8217;s career &#8212; not only his musical one, but also his acting (Bowie&#8217;s done several movies, including Jim Henson&#8217;s &#8220;Labyrinth&#8221; and &#8220;The Linguine Incident&#8221;). Ever since that first song, I&#8217;ve been a fan.<br />
We started the evening at Catch. I had given Tamara a gift certificate for Christmas, as she had regularly expressed her desire to eat there. I endulged (perhaps a little too much, but hey, it&#8217;s been a rough week). Unfortunately, we ended up running a little late, so we left without noticing that Tamara&#8217;s $50 certificate hadn&#8217;t, in fact, come off the bill. Something I&#8217;ll have to address in the morning.<br />
We grabbed a taxi to the Saddledome, arriving partway into Macy Gray&#8217;s opening act. (Bowie, if nothing else, knows that while the opening act should never be better than the headliner, it still needs to be solid.) My only regret of the evening (the gift certificate fiasco notwithstanding) was missing part of Macy Gray&#8217;s act.<br />
Arriving on the floor, we had to have someone guide us to our seats, not having a clue where they were. We figured we were off to the sides, which would have been fine for us. We just wanted to see the show. But the guide led us to the middle of the rows, eight away from the stage. Our seats were nearly dead-centre. We could see the individual hair fibres in Macy Gray&#8217;s afro.<br />
Tamara and I were damn near giddy with delight.<br />
Macy Gray is a solid performer. A bit of a freak, perhaps, but a total class act. And her band takes a great deal of pride in the work that they do. The result is an amazing show. I would gladly see Macy Gray again, should she swing around this area. (And a note to all of you who have yet to see David Bowie&#8217;s Reality show &#8212; don&#8217;t show up late! You won&#8217;t be disappointed.)<br />
The house lights soon came up, and the roadies began to set up for Bowie. Tamara disappeared for a while with her father (he and Tamara&#8217;s mother were a row behind us, about six seats to the right), returning about 10 minutes before the show with a tour book, and two drinks (I was the recipient of a free beer). And we waited.<br />
But we didn&#8217;t have to wait long. About 20:45, the music on the PA system changed, and suddenly you could hear David&#8217;s voice, and the band started playing. But no-one was on stage, and the lights hadn&#8217;t yet dimmed. The pixelboard behind the performer&#8217;s area came to life, showing an animated version of the band practicing. The lights started going out. The crowd was getting loud.<br />
It was time.<br />
One by one, David Bowie&#8217;s band started entering the stage. People whose names are usually forgotten were cheered loudly as they took their positions. There was a long pause from when the last one picked up their instrument until David walked out on stage, to deafening cheers and whistles. Without missing a single beat, they jumped right into what appears to be the opening song on the tour, &#8220;Rebel Rebel&#8221;.<br />
It was amazing. For the next two hours, David and his band flipped around over 35 years of music, switching from songs from his new album, to songs from his first, and almost every album in between. Ones you never heard of, ones that you heard yesterday, and ones that were great almost a generation ago. All but two or three, I knew or at least had heard once before.<br />
David Bowie isn&#8217;t just a singer-songwriter. He&#8217;s a performer. When he&#8217;s just singing, he&#8217;s acting. He&#8217;s making love to the audience because he wants to draw them into his world. For two hours, that&#8217;s precisely what happened. You were absorbed by his energy (I can only hope to look like him when I&#8217;m 57 years old), his passion, and his presence. He commanded without even having to really try.<br />
&#8220;Reality&#8221;, &#8220;New Killer Star&#8221;, &#8220;Fame&#8221;, &#8220;Under Pressure&#8221; (David&#8217;s bassist sings Freddie Mercury&#8217;s part amazingly well), &#8220;Life on Mars?&#8221;, &#8220;Ashes to Ashes&#8221;, &#8220;Heroes&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m Afraid of Americans&#8221; (which got a huge boost from the audience), &#8220;Ziggy Stardust&#8221;, and many others were all readily cheered. It was, without a doubt, one of the loudest concerts I&#8217;d been to &#8212; and not because of the band. (My ears are ringing, but I&#8217;ve been to louder, and much worse, concerts.)<br />
Early in the show, David decided that we&#8217;d done such a good job singing &#8220;All The Young Dudes&#8221;, that we could sing &#8220;China Girl&#8221; without him. The band started playing, but when the singing should have started, there wasn&#8217;t a peep from the audience (at least that you could hear). Bowie looked quite disgusted. He stopped the band, walked up to the mike, and announced:<br />
&#8220;That was fucking tragic.&#8221;<br />
He laughed with the rest of us, and then restarted the song, this time taking lead of the vocals. He seemed to like the audience participation. During his 5-6 song encore (I&#8217;m not sure exactly how many songs he did), he played a personal favourite: &#8220;Suffragette City&#8221;. There&#8217;s just nothing quite like hearing 13-odd thousand people all screaming: &#8220;Wham, bam, thank you, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; at the top of their lungs.<br />
There were two songs that I&#8217;d wanted to hear: &#8220;Space Oddity&#8221; and my personal favourite, &#8220;Modern Love&#8221;. According to his website, however, those songs haven&#8217;t appeared on any of his play lists. *Sigh* Well, if nothing else, it just gives me an excuse to see him the next time he&#8217;s anywhere in the area &#8230; which means most of this section of North America, of course.<br />
When the house lights came back on, it was hard to believe it was over. The energy had been amazing &#8212; we could have easily listened for another two hours. But it was almost 23:00, and time for most people to go home. (Some of us have to work tomorrow.)<br />
Tonight, David Bowie rocked Calgary. I can&#8217;t wait for the return of the Thin White Duke.</p>

		<p>First off, Happy New Year everyone!<br />
2003 was quite a year &#8212; quite a few good things, and a number of bad ones. In fact, not a lot of good ones, worldly-speaking, that is. Although not all the &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; lists are out yet, the ones that are on the Internet are (not surprisingly) mostly negative. Lots of death and tragedy, with the odd curling win to make things brighter. Let&#8217;s just hope this year comes with a little less strife than the year past.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One trilogy to rule them all. One trilogy to find them. One trilogy to bring them all, and in the darkness, bind them.<br />
Despite my repeated objections with the stupid things the movie industry does to we patrons of the celluloid arts (see <a href="http://www.sowrey.org/2003/11/movie-ticket-prices-and-acts-of-piracy/">Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy</a>), every so often they reward us with something unusual. Like showing all the Lord of the Rings trilogy all in one day.<br />
One very *long* day.<br />
We knew this was coming for quite some time. Being a movie geek, this sort of thing reached my delicate ears some time ago. First as the whisper of dark shadow in the east &#8230; er, as a rumour on the &#8216;Net. Then more confirmed reports slowly started to trickle in. Sure enough, it seemed like New Line Cinemas, along with the respective distributing houses, were going to put all three movies into a single theatre in one day. Only one day.<br />
One event to rule them all.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. Tamara, Jensenne, Jon, and myself were immediately taken with the idea of sitting on our butts for 12 hours, watching the collected magic of Peter Jackson&#8217;s toils. We also obtained a ticket for Adrian, who is probably the largest fan of our small group, but who was off-continent at the time. We couldn&#8217;t afford to wait for him to get back &#8212; tickets were on sale for a single showing, on a single day. Similar events in the United States of America sold out in a few hours.<br />
Tickets for the Lord of the Rings Marathon at Famous Player&#8217;s Paramount Chinook here in Calgary were worth $50. That&#8217;s about $16.66 per movie. And while I had worried that perhaps we would see nothing more than 12 hours of movies for that price, Alliance Atlantis (the Canadian distributor) was kind enough to send Lord of the Rings Film Frame Collectibles for everyone in the audience. (Basically, a fake stone case containing single frame of film from each of the three movies in the trilogy.) Probably worth at least $20 when they appear in stores. Better than a t-shirt.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: I found out from friends, shortly after publishing this entry, that the Film Frame Collectible (produced by WETA Workshop) was requested by New Line Cinemas *solely* for the audiences of the Trilogy. You won&#8217;t find this in stores, after all. Sorry to get your hopes up.]</em><br />
Tamara and I arrived at Chinook around 8:10 (16 December 2003, just in case you&#8217;re wondering), in search of Jensenne and Jon, who appeared at exactly the same time. (How fortunate.) Parking, we found that the official lineup was inside, and already well underway. About 30 people were already seated on pads, folding deck chairs, and I almost expected to see a blow-up couch. That was fine with us. Breaking only momentarily to get food (none of us had eaten), we took up a place in line, and waited.<br />
While the mall was open nice and early (for store staff and the ubiquitous mall walkers), the theatre was not and would not until 11:00. We had a little time to kill. This prompted Jon to scuttle off to bring back his laptop, so we could watch movies on the DVD player. (Jon was only one of six people to bring laptops for watching movies.) It was certainly a pleasant way to spend time sitting on a concrete floor.<br />
When the doors finally opened, there was a controlled passage of patient patrons from the mall, up the escalator, through the (overly) cavernous lobby, and into Theatre 9. We would spend over 13 hours in that room, either sitting and waiting, or watching and experiencing. Jensenne managed to burst by a few people and got among the best seats in the house: upper front-row.<br />
In Chinook, the seating is divided in two where the entrance enters into the room, roughly one-third of the way up the seats. In this division, there is a wide aisle that runs the width of the theatre, allowing traffic up the opposite side from the entrance/exit. It is here where the best seats are to be had &#8212; because you have leg room. And when you&#8217;re in there for over 13 hours, you need all the leg room you can get.<br />
The manager, a man barely into his 20s from what we could tell, laid out the ground rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you leave the theatre at any time for any reason, make sure you have your ticket. If you do not have it, you will not be let in for any reason. (Yes, this sound quite trite &#8212; isn&#8217;t this the way it&#8217;s always done? But in the past, you could get in if you sounded convincing enough.)</li>
<li>There would be two breaks: 45 minutes from &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings&#8221; to &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;, and a 30-minute break from &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; to &#8220;Return of the King&#8221;. The first movie would start at 13:30, the second at 17:45, and the third at 22:00, sharp.</li>
<li>If your cellphone or pager goes off for any reason, you will be removed from the event for its duration without refund. This almost got a standing ovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the wait, we watched &#8220;X-Men 2&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; (which Jon bought while waiting for his laptop battery to recharge). It was better than trying to read or wander, or even play the Scrabble that I&#8217;d brought along, just in case.<br />
Adrian appeared about 15 minutes before &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; began. (He had only obtained a half day off, and had to go home first, because he had forgotten his ticket there.) Snacks in hand, the lights went down, the crowd went up, and the marathon began.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t get into the first movie. I&#8217;ve seen it &#8230; several times now. And while both &#8220;Fellowship of the Ring&#8221; and &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221; were the extended releases, I&#8217;ve seen the extended &#8220;Fellowship&#8221; a few times. In other words, my mind wandered most of the movie.<br />
When the first break came, no-one left. This was when we received our little tokens for spending the day cooped up in a movie theatre. You wouldn&#8217;t believe the rush that charged the poor staff &#8230; mostly because there wasn&#8217;t one. Not a single one. Everyone very orderly went up, row by row, calmly received their gift (and thanking the staff), and moved on. No scuffle, no problem.<br />
Just try that with Trekkies, and you&#8217;ll have a bloodbath on your hands!<br />
At this point, I would like to give out kudos to the Famous Players Paramount Chinook staff. It was because of them that we had such a great day. They were always courteous, always smiling, and simply nice. It made sitting around all that time surprisingly comfortable.<br />
I was accidentally abandoned in the theatre. I was on guard duty with the seats. The others were gone. I needed to pee, badly. I wanted a drink refill. I wanted a pizza! (I was starving, and the thought of eating nothing but popcorn was utterly revolting.) With fewer than 10 minutes left in the break, Adrian reappeared. I bolted to make the rounds.<br />
And so began &#8220;The Two Towers&#8221;. Unlike the previous film, I was quite able to absorb myself in the movie. For starters, I hadn&#8217;t seen it nearly as much, nor had I seen the entire extended version. It&#8217;s a long movie, too &#8212; about three hours and 45 minutes. You wouldn&#8217;t have heard any complaints from anyone in the audience, though. Jokes were still laughed at, cheers for the good guys, and tears when heroes died.<br />
Second break. I bolted almost immediately, wanting to get some time for myself. We also had a shorter break. Everyone was in their seats when the manager proudly announced that the third movie would begin in only a couple of moments. You&#8217;d have thought it was the first movie of the evening &#8212; everyone was still cheering, still clapping, still energetic. And so began the final chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />
It was new material. Except for trailers or those who had downloaded clips (or the entire thing) from the Internet, none of us had seen this before. I think just about everyone had grins running ear-to-ear. But despite the newness, the ending couldn&#8217;t come quickly enough. There are several almost-endings, as the movie begins to tie up all the threads to finish off the story. After so much time watching movies, though, all we wanted was for the story to end so we could go home. When the words &#8220;The End&#8221; appeared, people cheered heartily, and headed for the door.<br />
Now, dear reader, this is where this story should end. But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230;<br />
For this morning, after about six hours of rest, we rose again to make our way to the Cineplex Eau Claire theatres. Critical Mass had sponsored a special Christmas event for us &#8212; a private showing of &#8220;Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&#8221;. And no, you don&#8217;t need to ask if I went. As if I&#8217;d miss that.<br />
Besides, someone had to give Terri the five-minute synopsis of the first two movies, which she hadn&#8217;t seen. (Yes, believe it or not, I can be that brief.)<br />
We waited briefly in the line before they started letting us in around 8:15. Twenty-four hours, two separate theatres, same damn lineup. We passed by the concession stand &#8212; Tamara and I held our breath. I hate the smell of popcorn in the morning. It smells like &#8230; popcorn. And after so much of it yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t stomach even the smell, let alone the thought of eating more.<br />
I dozed twice briefly before finding my second wind. But within 12 hours, I had seen the movie twice. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad, so for now I&#8217;ll leave it just as: I saw it. And it was good.<br />
The trilogy is now over. There will be no more. No sequels, no spinoffs. It was a finely-crafted triology, the likes of which we will be lucky to see again. But if we do, we will consider ourselves fortunate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>
