Day 11<br />
And on the 11th day, they rested.<br />
I awoke as the train pulled into Sioux Lookout, ON. This isolated town is the launching point for excursions into the north, and for sportsmen heading out for fishing and hunting expeditions. It&#8217;s also a divisional point on CN &#8212; we were again changing engineers.<br />
Gerry&#8217;s father-in-law hailed from Sioux Lookout, and Gerry has some ties to the town. No sooner than we arrived, he dove out to find a church to which the family had donated stained glass windows. I sufficed with photographs from the train.<br />
The train pulled out not long after I&#8217;d finished breakfast, on our way to the next divisional point, Armstrong. I took up residence in the dome for a while to watch the scenery before I realized I was about to fall asleep. I returned to my lower berth for some additional rest. At around 11:15, 139 miles further down the line, we pulled in for train orders. I felt more awake than I had in days.<br />
The battle for the shower began about two minutes out of Armstrong. Ingrid, Stefani, and I all wanted in. Somehow, though I had been waiting longer than the other two, I ended up going last. There was probably some chivalristic thing going on, but it was probably that fighting over something that trivial only succeeds in making people angry.<br />
[I should note that a couple of days later, I found out that I&#8217;m a hipocrite. Earlier in the trip, Emma and I had run into a similar situation. I can&#8217;t honestly remember doing this, so either I was completely out of my mind &#8212; a plausible situation &#8212; or I was being a jerk. I jumped into the shower ahead of Emma after she&#8217;d declared that she needed one. How chivalristic of me&#8230;]<br />
The day passed wonderfully slow. We talked, slept, ate, napped, read, rested, and didn&#8217;t think about what was coming next. It was a day spent doing nothing but watching relaxing scenery and goofing off. Our first true day off since we started two weeks ago.<br />
I sat watching out windows. The scenery up here is gorgeous. &#8220;Ontario&#8221; means &#8220;Land of Shining Waters&#8221;, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. I couldn&#8217;t hope to count the number of lakes we passed between Armstrong and Hornepayne. The trees screened the lakes, a slow tantalizing reveal as we moved along. As I stared at the near-blur of trees, it became a kind of strange martial art.<br />
Xen and the Art of Passing Trees. As the tree passes, look at its shape, it&#8217;s colour. How does it differ from those around it? Is it attractive? Is it happy? Does it look healthy? Would the tree be a good friend, or an enemy? As you contemplate the tree, can you see the forest behind it?<br />
We arrived in Hornepayne around 19:15. Another divisional point, it still retains some remnants of its former railway glory: the coaling tower and an engine house. Here we expected to leave for Capreol, where I had hoped to take pictures of ex-CNR steam locomotive #6077. It&#8217;s a sister locomotive to the Rocky Mountain Rail Society&#8217;s #6060, one I work on as frequently as I&#8217;m able.<br />
It seems fate, however, is not on my side today. A derailment on the CN line has blocked our exit. As of 22:44, as I write this, we are still in Hornepayne. Although the plan is not yet entirely clear to me, we are to continue to Oba, south to Franz along the Algoma Central, and then along CP to Sudbury. We completely bypass Capreol. #6077 will have to wait.</p>

Day 10<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say much about today that&#8217;s positive.<br />
We could analyze the events of the day to try and determine what went wrong. The exercise would be fruitless and pointless, except to determine what not to do next time. Not enough space, too many people, combined with poor local organization and a train location that proved to be nothing short of a nightmare led to a disasterous show. We had a lot of happy people, but far too many unhappy ones &#8212; and they were usually us.<br />
We love running this show across Canada. Sure, we&#8217;ve had rough times and stops that we didn&#8217;t think were great. But never before as this team been so entirely upset about trying their best and being told it isn&#8217;t enough. It was disheartening to be berated by patrons and even volunteers who don&#8217;t know how much sweat and tears that has been spilled since the start. It was enough for us to want to close down early and run screaming.<br />
Although we suspected from yesterday that Winnipeg would be hard, I don&#8217;t think any of us thought that Winnipeg would be our Waterloo.<br />
It all began just after noon, when the schools started arriving. From 12:00 to 15:00, we would run group tours (in other words, schools) through the museum. This also meant, of course, all our other exhibits.<br />
The Boutique and New Media were in the rotunda of Union Station, along with Radio-Canada and a production set for a live broadcast starting around 16:00. It was cramped, but bearable. Throw in a few hundred children, and cramped becomes contemptible.<br />
I remember being a student. I remember field trips. We were bloody murder on teachers. But I also remember having some serious strict discipline if we ever got out too far out of line. Most of the CBC crew remember that. Either we were being too critical, or a large number of the children who came were complete terrors. To the point where hidden keyboards were pulled out, computers almost hacked (we had to keep a very close eye), and children who almost ruined the Friendly Giant&#8217;s costume in the museum.<br />
The chaos in the rotunda came nowhere near the level of mayhem in the back parking lot. Sports, News, and Children&#8217;s tents were under siege from a thousand hands, all wanting something. Few thank-yous were heard, almost no eye contact, and virtually no interaction. At times, it was like watching piranhas strip a body to its skeleton. None of the tents had volunteers. We were on our own.<br />
Things went from worse to terrible. Apparently, one of the schools had disadvantaged children. On such child had anger issues. He hit Franklin, hard enough to crack the helmet inside the head. Luckily, the volunteer wasn&#8217;t injured, but the damage was done. Emma was beside herself &#8212; how on earth could a child like that be allowed to attend something like this? How Emma made it through the day without screaming (or a few stiff shots of scotch) is amazing.<br />
By 15:00, we were all ready to pack up and leave. But people had already started arriving for the public event. We still had five hours to endure. We held hope that it was just the children, and that the public would be more understanding. To a degree, they were. But the temperamental individuals more than made up for the nice people.<br />
Barely an hour into the show, one of the volunteers in the rotunda &#8212; an elderly man &#8212; came up to me and asked who ran the show. A bit of a vague question, I asked for clarity. He then asked who ran the museum. The answer was Ivan. The man offered a suggestion on how to improve things. My &#8220;Danger Will Robinson, Danger!&#8221; alarm went off immediately. I took a chance and asked what his idea was.<br />
&#8220;Move the train.&#8221;<br />
The man had a valid point. The train was parked in a very awkward location, making it difficult for people to get to it. But that was the best we could do &#8212; we didn&#8217;t have a lot of options to play with. Such was the nature of the site. I tried my best to defuse the man&#8217;s insistence, offering the thought that this situation had been addressed a lot in the last few weeks, and this was the best we could do. My suggestion fell on deaf ears, and the man pronounced that he was going to do something about it.<br />
&#8220;Geoff to Julie, urgent!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Go for Julie.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I need you in the rotunda, ASAP.&#8221;<br />
I never knew humans could turn such an interesting shade of red. Had Julie been a more predatory animal, say a lion, I&#8217;m sure she would have taken the man&#8217;s head off. He was encouraged to leave immediately. He lingered a while longer, complaining and pointing at me &#8230; but soon he was gone and it was one less problem to deal with. But when you&#8217;re having a day full of problems, one less problem doesn&#8217;t really do much.<br />
Neil, Julie, and Debbie were the breakwaters against the hurricane of trouble. How they got through the day without either breaking down or blowing up I cannot fathom. I watched as one person decided to cut deeply into Neil, claiming false advertising when the tickets to the museum all sold out before she arrived. I felt for him. I can&#8217;t imagine how much that must have hurt.<br />
In our larger venues, we give out tickets to the museum. This is to control the flow of visitors. We&#8217;ve had a few complaints about it &#8212; why don&#8217;t we just let people fend for themselves? The answer is easy: fewer people will get through the museum, and we&#8217;ll have more angry people who didn&#8217;t make it in. At least this way, we can manage the crowd, and let people know that they won&#8217;t get in.<br />
Probably the single biggest issue was the local organizer, Raydene (or maybe Raylene &#8230; like it matters, we know it&#8217;s just a pseudonym for &#8220;Satan&#8221;). This woman was supposed to have organized everything in the area, so we could concentrate on what was going on. But she didn&#8217;t organize anything, it seemed. Volunteers disappeared regularly, didn&#8217;t show up when we thought they were supposed to, she didn&#8217;t allow for feeding the volunteers or provide water, and we heard things like this all day over the walkie-talkies, never hearding the expected responses:<br />
&#8220;Debbie to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Neil to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Analisa to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Emma to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Julie to Raydene&#8230;&#8221; [said while spitting fire through gritted teeth]<br />
As the day progressed, we started making plans for packing up. This was going to be a stash-n-dash. This was our shortest pack time, and has been worrying us since Vancouver. We had a short period of time to strike our sets and pack everything up. This concerned me a lot, because the New Media kiosks take a while to pack up. But our Fearless Leaders had a plan.<br />
Sports, News, and Children&#8217;s tents would come down at 19:00, an hour early. At 20:00, New Media and Boutique would strike. The theory was that by 20:00, the other three tents would be packed, and everyone would help strike the remaining two. (It was also loosely necessary because of the live broadcast that went on right next to our two displays &#8212; we had to wait to do our packing job.) It gave me a bit of pause, but I put faith in the plan. At that point, faith was about all I had left.<br />
The last two hours in the rotunda were the worst. All day, bright spotlights had made the temperature soar. Starting around 17:30, hundreds started to filter into the rotunda to watch the live broadcast. It started to get warmer. The small space caused further problems &#8212; everyone had to pack in tight. This rendered both Boutique and New Media almost inaccessible. This was both a blessing (fewer things to watch for) and a curse (couldn&#8217;t keep an eye on what was happening).<br />
Just before 19:00, the radio chatter started. The tents outside were coming down, and instructions aplenty bantered back and forth. The mood over the radio had changed. Earlier in the day, it had been tired, distraught, even tense. Now it was driven, determined, and focused. The end was in sight, and everyone wanted out.<br />
At 19:30, Debbie and I started to close down New Media. It was time to close out another ShowVote category. By 19:50, the six computers featuring ShowVote were off. We were disconnecting cords, wrapping up cables, and preparing for the imminent rush.<br />
It was now really tight. The broadcast (now featuring Fred Penner) had shifted to the celebration, including the largest birthday cake I&#8217;ve ever seen. It was wheeled in right between New Media and the Boutique, cramming people against both booths. Although the broadcast finished just after 20:00, we had a serious people problem &#8212; people were leaving too slowly.<br />
The rest of the team arrived, armed and ready to help. Tabletops were removed, computers packed, tables flattened. The screwgun arrived and the centre triangle came down. The monitor boxes contained within the triangle were rapidly filled with monitors, and the plasma screen packed away. Over at the Boutique, unsold merchandise returned to their respective boxes, taped up, and loaded on a VIA luggage cart. Within 30 minutes, we had taken down both booths.<br />
Luckily, the crowd had filtered out when we started to haul things upstairs. When we&#8217;d set up on Sunday, the freight elevators were trouble. We were a little worried that they would slow us down, or worse, malfunction. Instead, they probably saved us a great deal of time. The process worked so well, we finished by 21:20, a full 40 minutes ahead of our departure time.<br />
Neil, Emma, and Rose were on their way back to Toronto. None of them were leaving us permanently. Rose has a lot of business to handle, and will rejoin us in Windsor. Neil and Emma need to see their families, and tackle pressing issues. Both will return when we do our Toronto show on the 22nd.<br />
I ate a dinner I originally didn&#8217;t want. I was far to stressed and tired to be hungry, but Debbie convinced me to eat. I took a table right next to CBC celebrities Ian Hanomansing, Diane Swain, Peter Jordon, and another woman who was a radio personality (unfortunately, I&#8217;m not well up on my CBC radio names). I was so tired I didn&#8217;t even notice they were there. It wasn&#8217;t until I heard Ian&#8217;s voice that I realized who was behind me.<br />
We were exhausted, mentally, physically, and emotionally. We all needed showers and about two days&#8217; sleep. We wanted to leave. We had to wait. We needed a new locomotive.<br />
Our train has two diesel electric locomotives: #6403, which is our CBC-decaled lead locomotive, and #6412, a second VIA locomotive that&#8217;s mostly backup. We lost #6412 outside of Biggar when the crankcase exploded. (That&#8217;s why you have a backup.) We had to pick up another locomotive before tackling northern Ontario. It&#8217;s a long ride, and you don&#8217;t want to cross it solo.<br />
Taking #6412&#8217;s place was #6449. It had come in on the #2 train the day before (eastbound Canadian), pulled off due to mechanical failure. Repaired, it was turned over to us. Once the both engines were fuelled, they were reattached and air brakes tested.<br />
I was in the Skyline&#8217;s dome when the train started forward. There was a sudden overwhelming rush of relief as we pulled out of the station. While I had been excited to come to Winnipeg, like everyone else I was ecstatic to depart.<br />
Almost instantly, people began to slowly unwind. Some went directly to bed. Others sat and watched the dark scenery pass. The train was quiet, save for the blats of #6403&#8217;s horn, and the clanking of the train as we rolled along.</p>

Day 9<br />
We arrived in Winnipeg somewhere around 05:00. I use the vagueness because I&#8217;m not entirely sure. I was quite tired, and still don&#8217;t know what possessed me to open the window and look. When I saw us arriving at Union Station, I returned to my slumber.<br />
The sounds of activity eventually pulled me from bed, and into action. Though that was mostly due to my bladder. Unfortunately, Winnipeg was our first stop without honeypots (the large barrels that collected human waste from the toilets). We had to hike into the station and track down the bathrooms in there. Fortunately, Winnipeg&#8217;s Union Station isn&#8217;t like Toronto&#8217;s &#8212; no steady stream of passengers to see us so dishevelled first thing in the morning.<br />
Breakfast soon woke me up, just in time to meet our new crew member. Today, CJ finished her time with us. We gain Debbie in her place. I am sorry to see CJ leave. Although we started off on the wrong foot, we ended good partners. I look forward to seeing her in Toronto. We&#8217;ve also gained a replacement for Enza&#8217;s position: Ingrid. In a way, I kind of feel bad for her &#8212; I hear a lot of &#8220;I miss Enza&#8221;. It&#8217;s not directed at Ingrid, but she does have a legacy to live up to.<br />
CJ wasn&#8217;t the only person leaving. This morning&#8217;s breakfast would be the last for our entire initial crew (not counting [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Remembering 9/11|Enza&#8217;s departure]] five days ago). Today is the first rotation of personnel. Most of the VIA crew rotates out here, with only Peter and Jeanine carrying through to Toronto. Perhaps the most depressing part for many people is that the band is also leaving. Due to prior engagements, Frank has to leave us here. Frank, David, Paul, and Richard all want to stay on board, and at one point tried to rearrange their schedules to see where they could come back. We will see them again, but probably not on the train.<br />
In commemoration of the crew change, we took a full cast photo in the rotunda, including the VIA staff. It was a sad affair, as we said goodbye to new friends and comrades. It&#8217;s been a great week &#8212; I can&#8217;t wait to see what the next weeks bring us.<br />
Following breakfast, I took a wander around the station. Everyone I know from the Winnipeg area has been telling me for a while that I needed to see Union Station. They were right &#8212; it&#8217;s quite beautiful. Originally opened in 1911 by the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern railroads, Winnipeg&#8217;s Union Station is a shining example of Beaux Arts architectural style. (And if you&#8217;re wondering, I got that snippet from a plaque hung on the wall.)<br />
Of particular note is the rotunda. This large room has welcomed countless waves of immigrants and visitors to Winnipeg, it&#8217;s cavernous ceiling alluding to the wonders that await beyond the doors. Aside from cracks in the rotunda floor, the building has survived the years well. The cracks stem from the platoons of soldiers who marched through this station in the 1940s. Their combined weight and rhythmic step caused the floor to flex and break.<br />
Also of note is the railway museum on Track 1. When railway traffic declined in Canada, Winnipeg was left with a mostly-empty station. (Toronto&#8217;s Union Station became a commuter rail hub.) The unused space was rented to Winnipeg Railway Museum. They brought in their vintage equipment including the Countess of Dufferin, the first locomotive in northwestern Canada. I know this because one of the VIA staff had a key to the door and let me in. I just had to be quiet and quick, so the museum staff wouldn&#8217;t catch me in there.<br />
Today&#8217;s event was for Winnipeg CBC employees. A lighter load for some of us, it still required a full setup. This was the hard part. It was our first multi-level setup &#8212; the train is on the second floor of the station. Our equipment went either to the rear parking lot or to the rotunda, both underneath. It took nearly twice as long to set up as usual. I tried to show Debbie what CJ and I have figured out over the last week, so she&#8217;ll have fewer bruises. But with the nature of our layouts, things always happen.<br />
The setup was far from perfect. It took a long time to get equipment downstairs, mostly due to a sudden breakdown of the freight elevator. This stranded Neil and Cliff for the better part of an hour, along with a cart full of equipment destined for the rotunda.<br />
By roughly 14:00, the New Media area was complete, and it was time to break for the hotel. I desperately needed a shower. With the on-train services suspended in the station, and several hours of labour, I felt a little more dirty than I cared to admit.<br />
Before we left, a small group of us took lunch at a hamburger stand across the road. Angela had sworn these were the best hamburgers to be had. They were tasty, indeed, and most importantly filled the hole that had since formed in my belly.<br />
Again, our hotel was way out in the middle of nowhere. This isn&#8217;t CBC&#8217;s fault &#8212; I can only assume it&#8217;s Holiday Inn (when you get free rooms, you get what you&#8217;re given). We&#8217;ve had one hotel downtown: Vancouver. The others have been substantial drives from the train and from downtown. (Although in Saskatoon, we were reasonably close to good restaurants and nightclubs.)<br />
Clean again, I returned to the station to explore a bit. I caught a cab with Daryl &#8212; he went for lunch, and I went down to The Forks. The Forks is old railways land just to the east of Union Station. Back in the Golden Age of railroads, this was CN&#8217;s yard in the downtown. Roundhouse, ice house, car shop &#8212; it was all here. (It&#8217;s now in the Transcona Yard to the east of the city.) The Forks is now trendy area of downtown with parkland, restaurants, and shops.<br />
CN and CP had a great ability to always choose the best land in town. In many other cities, the abandoned land eventually came very expensive condos, golf courses, or sports stadiums. Winnipeg had enough sense to make it into parkland and public places. They even kept the old railway lift bridge &#8212; it&#8217;s now a stationary pedestrian bridge.<br />
The event was dead. Cemeteries see more life than the New Media booth did. Sadly, the other booths outside and the museum were hammered with visitors. We assumed it was because the free food was out there. We noticed one thing that did worry us &#8212; the people seemed a bit testy. Western Canadians are general an agreeable folk, who are generally easy-going. These people seemed itching to take someone&#8217;s head off. We shall see tomorrow if that continues.<br />
When closing time arrived, we didn&#8217;t pack up. Because we&#8217;re setting up in the same location tomorrow, all we had to do was turn everything off. The tents outside brought the expensive items indoors, and walled off the booths. Back to the hotel, a brief beverage in the lounge, and we were off to bed. We need all the sleep we can get. Based on how today went, tomorrow will be a long day.</p>

Day 8<br />
We&#8217;ve been on the road now for a week. It feels like a month. We started working together as a group 10 days ago in Vancouver. Then, we were a collection of small teams and individuals linked by a common project. In the last week and a half, we&#8217;ve grown into almost a small family. Our team is strong, almost to the point of being able to read each other&#8217;s thoughts. It&#8217;s caused a little trouble every now and then, but on a whole we&#8217;re quite close knit.<br />
We&#8217;ve come to see the train as home &#8212; many people have welcomed their tiny berths after spending a night in some cavernous hotel room. The train is large enough for us to spread out and find a quiet corner. Likewise, we can also group together into a room and have fun as a group. It&#8217;s our home, it&#8217;s our office, it&#8217;s our museum and storage locker, and it&#8217;s our safety blanket.<br />
After spending the night off the train, we were excited to get back to our home away from home. Too many nights away from the bed you know and love can be troublesome. With the schedules we&#8217;ve been keeping, stability is necessary. And with little time for relaxation off-train, we sometimes overcompensate.<br />
That&#8217;s what happened to us this morning. The previous night had been a long one, and some of us were a little late to start the day. I awoke when my biological panic alarm told me I was going to miss the train. I leapt from bed at 07:34, did a rudimentary clean, and quickly changed. I was out the door by 07:45. I made it with time to spare, and took the shuttle bus with the rest of the group.<br />
Others were not so lucky. Fred, our VIA representative, was actually late arriving at the train. Yes, this was the same guy who had reinforced the necessity to be punctual, on almost a daily basis. Unfortunately for Fred, this means an endless string of punctuality jokes for the remainder of his stay onboard.<br />
We headed across the prairies to Melville, a four-hour trip. Originally, Daryl and I were to fly in a helicopter, so Daryl could shoot video of the train, and I could take pictures. (The big need was for video. I would have been a fortunate side-effect.) For some strange reason, all the helicopters are based in Melville. The cost to fly them from Melville, pick us up and take us back was just too prohibitive. It&#8217;s the second time I&#8217;ve almost had the chance to chase a train from a helicopter, but missed out for some reason beyond my control.<br />
The trip to Melville clinched the desire to travel only by rail. I own a car, but use it only when I have to. I fly, because my family lives in Ontario and it&#8217;s too far for me to drive. I would take the train, but passenger rail service no longer goes to my home of Calgary (though many of the VIA staff assured me it will return next summer). But as I sat in my seat in the dome of our Skyline car, I started wishing and hoping for VIA&#8217;s return to the southern Prairies.<br />
Melville is named for Charles Melville Hayes, president of the Grand Trunk Pacific railway in the early 1900s, which chose the site of Melville as a divisional point on its line. Hayes was one of the fateful passengers of the Titanic years later.<br />
Today, Melville is still a divisional point on a railway, only now it&#8217;s the Canadian National. It&#8217;s roundhouse and support facilities are all gone, washed away with progress. However, the yard is still large, and locomotive crews change in and out at Melville. Tourism, however, isn&#8217;t quite as large a draw. (The CN station is closed, save for CN Operations, but the VIA station is still open.)<br />
Parking on a siding next to the platform track, we proceeded to unload our equipment for a partial event. This was a challenge enough, though &#8212; the track sat high, and there was a significant slop away from the track ballast. It would take nearly every apple box (a small wooden box used for many purposes, including steps and supports) to keep things level.<br />
At every stop we do, the technical crew has to assemble the stairs. This is how people get in and out of the museum cars. Normally, it&#8217;s not too big a deal. A little shimming here and there, and the stairs magically line up. But normally, we have flat surfaces. Even in Biggar, the ground was fairly flat. This required a lot of planning to even get the stairs erected, let alone stable. But the end result, as always, was a perfectly level set of stairs.<br />
As with Biggar, people started arriving almost as soon as the train pulled in. We were officially open between 16:00 and 20:00. Melvillians seemed unable to wait. By 15:30, we were open for business in our front tent, and the museum lineup started to form.<br />
The other line that formed was for bug spray. The field we were setting up on was home to a mosquito population equal to Toronto, and at least one grasshopper for each person in Melville. While the grasshoppers were enough to make a few people queasy, the mosquitoes would prove a far larger problem.<br />
While the sun was out in full force, we had little to worry about. People kept arriving, checking out our front desks, listening to Frank Leahy and Friends, and visiting the museum. As dinner time rolled around, however, fewer people came out. At first, we thought it was just for dinner. But it wasn&#8217;t human dinner at issue &#8230; it was humans for dinner.<br />
In the span of about a half hour, the mosquito swarm quadrupled. They hadn&#8217;t paid me a second glance for most of the day. Now it seemed they were thinking: &#8220;Hey, we haven&#8217;t eaten him yet!&#8221; Before long, those of us outside were in long pants, and arm-length fleeces with collars. It wasn&#8217;t helping much.<br />
The bugs were so bad we closed early. Our official strike time was 20:00. Everything, including a complex stair configuration, was loaded by 20:20. Our departure time was 23:30 (our first window in the train schedules). It was enough time for some of the crew to find the local watering hole. I regretfully stayed behind to catch up on work.<br />
I&#8217;ve decided that we&#8217;re doing much more than just the celebration of CBC&#8217;s 50th anniversary. That&#8217;s our official job. Unofficially, and more personally for the crew, we seem to be conducting our own little tour: the Trans-Canada Pub Crawl. Ever since Emma tried to find that bar in Kamloops, there&#8217;s been an overwhelming desire to hit bars and pubs in every town we arrive in.<br />
They should do a beer commercial about us.<br />
While waiting for our comrades to return, VIA&#8217;s on-board mechanic, Peter, offered me a chance to climb into the cab of our lead locomotive. The work would wait. Peter, like myself, is a railfan. The main difference between him and I is that he turned his hobby into a full-time job. It gets him close to the things he loves, and gets him in the doors of other similar interests.<br />
VIA #6403 is our lead locomotive, and is the one that we decaled for the trip. It&#8217;s followed by #6412, painted in regular VIA livery. VIA will swap out #6412 in Winnipeg before we go across Ontario. It blew out a crankcase somewhere around Biggar, and has been useless for two days. That&#8217;s assuming the eastbound Canadian doesn&#8217;t get our replacement first &#8212; #6443 on that train caught fire around Edson, and has been removed.<br />
I&#8217;ve been in the cabs of several steam locomotives. I&#8217;ve been in the cabs of a few diesels, including an early F7. But I&#8217;ve never been in an F40PH-2 (the workhorse of VIA&#8217;s fleet). It&#8217;s a newer locomotive (although already 25 years old), armed with a HEP (head-end power) generator.<br />
Modern diesel cabs are quite simple. Aside from the obvious training needed to operate on a modern Class 1 railroad such as Canadian National, a child could use the controls. That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that they don&#8217;t play around with the electrical system. That&#8217;s a little more complicated. And very, very dangerous.<br />
While Peter explained the operation of the locomotive (it didn&#8217;t take too long), the engineers arrived for the next leg of the trip. They didn&#8217;t seem to mind at all that I was in there. I took a snapshot of the cab, and then Peter took me through the engine room.<br />
There four basic parts to a modern diesel electric engine: the wheels (with the electric motors), the cab, the alternator (which produces electricity), and the engine. I&#8217;d never been in an engine room for a diesel electric locomotive. I knew the engines were big. I just had no idea how big.<br />
The floor of the engine room is lower than the cab. The engine is sunk in the floor. Yet the engine still towered above me. And it was noisy. The Who don&#8217;t have concerts that loud. And it wasn&#8217;t under load &#8212; going in there while underway without ear protection is a really bad idea. Leaving Peter to his job, I returned to the coach car to try and finish typing out profiles.<br />
At around 22:30, Darryl set up his Mini-DV player to show a montage of scenes he&#8217;s been filming since we started this madcap adventure. The show has been just Daryl. He shoots the film, edits the film, and edits the sound. Originally, I was the one fingered to do the job. In hindsight, the decision to bring on Daryl was certainly the right one. I couldn&#8217;t imagine doing all that I am, doing all the Daryl does, and producing anything remotely as good as what he has.<br />
When the movie preview finished, there was a quick presentation to Julie, Neil, Analisa, and Debbie. The four of them have been keeping this project moving smoothly, and they&#8217;ve all lost sleep as a result.<br />
With that, we all retired. It would to be a long day in Winnipeg.</p>

Day 7<br />
Friday the 13th has never been good for me. Some say it&#8217;s just superstition. Experience tells me otherwise.<br />
Today started at 03:00. For most cities, it&#8217;s an unruly hour. For Saskatoon, it&#8217;s downright ungodly. Nothing happens in Saskatoon at three in the morning. Except, of course, us preparing for an eastern broadcast. Julie and I whisked our way down to the VIA Rail station for a live broadcast with Colleen Jones. Luckily, we sort of knew where we were going. Aside from almost missing the turn off for the main road south, the rest was easy to find, even in the dark. (You can&#8217;t miss the grain elevator down there.)<br />
While I would love to say that I got to be on TV with Colleen, that&#8217;s not the truth. Colleen is a one-woman show, and is perfectly suited for the job. You want impressive? Try reading off the weather forecast for the entire country while having it read to you through an earpiece and make it sound natural. I have a hard enough time relaying messages over the phone to people who don&#8217;t care what it sounds like.<br />
So why was I there? Colleen wanted to review the New Media kiosks. This is my little jurisdiction. Paranoia, and a far-too-good in-depth knowledge of how computers behave told me that I needed to be there. Originally, I offered my services. Then I insisted that I be there. I&#8217;d rather lose a couple hours of sleep for sanity of mind.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen a television broadcast before, certainly not a live broadcast. It&#8217;s quite an experience to see how this is all handled with a camera operator, another person whose role I never really figured out, and Colleen. Julie and I were there for answering questions (off-camera, when Colleen wasn&#8217;t live on the air) and covering the technical issues. (During a couple of breaks, I whipped in for a few pointers.)<br />
By 05:30, the show was done and we were on our way back to the hotel. My intention was to sleep a little while, do some work, and then prepare for our event. Instead, I rolled around for an hour, and ended up groggy for the whole day. In addition to that, I lost my cellular phone, my gloves, forgot to tell Stefani when our shuttle was leaving, and probably said a few things I didn&#8217;t mean to say because I was too tired to think straight.<br />
In short, Friday the 13th was continuing its historical trend.<br />
About the only thing that&#8217;s gone right so far is the journals. After wrestling a position on the hotel&#8217;s &#8220;office&#8221; computer (we&#8217;re without wireless access again), I managed to email my files to Toronto for posting on the website. Brenda&#8217;s decided to streamline the process a wee bit. Due to connectivity problems, we simply can&#8217;t do the &#8220;every day&#8221; posting we&#8217;d wanted to do. So instead of me sending templates, I&#8217;ll just send text and pictures, and let Elizabeth and Terri sort out the details. And that&#8217;s just fine with me.<br />
When we arrived at the VIA Rail station, my booth was most set up. All we needed to do was erect an extra table for the paper ShowVote ballots and prepare a few configurations on the computers. We had ample time, and didn&#8217;t rush our last part of the set up.<br />
The wind outside was terrific. All the tents were staked down. Dust was constantly in the wind (Bill S. wrote in his journal: &#8220;&#8216;Saskatoon&#8217; is Indian for &#8216;shit gets in your eye'&#8221;.) Many of the stand-ups had to retreat to the baggage car, or at least be tied to the tent poles so they wouldn&#8217;t blow away.<br />
As usual, people were arriving long before we were done. This seemed to be a trend I doubt we&#8217;ll ever get away from. But it didn&#8217;t matter to those who came early. They seemed quite happy to wait for things to start happening. I love the patience of the prairies.<br />
Our previous events had primarily been our show, with the odd bit of content thrown in by the regional organizers. In Saskatoon, we were now dealing with Radio-Canada (the French version of CBC), who not only occupied a significant amount of space, but also ran much of the live radio broadcasting. We seemed to have our first true CBC celebration &#8212; not just the train.<br />
Guests arrived in a fairly regular flow. We weren&#8217;t hit with the surges we&#8217;ve received in previous stops. Our regional organizers were quite good in setting up other activities &#8212; like face-painting &#8212; that not only evened out the flow, but probably attracted people to stay in the station building, where the Boutique and New Media were located.<br />
The face painters were amazing. I&#8217;ve never seen face painting like that outside of a couple Cirque du Soliel shows I&#8217;ve seen. It was an assembly line, where one person laid down the foundation, and another person marked the details. I think they had three lines going all at once. It got to the point where nearly everyone &#8212; including CJ and several of our volunteers &#8212; had painted faces. What really impressed me was finding out that they were all former street kids, who had been hired by the company, taught to do their trade, and are hugely successful. At one point, Julie even muttered something about wanting to have taken them on the entire trip, had she known about them.<br />
The day skipped by quite quickly. Well, for me, anyway. I crawled into my bunk on the train and snoozed for a couple of hours, lest I pass out at the kiosks. (Not that it really helped much.) Despite this being our longest event to date, we arrived at the hour of 19:00 far faster than I had thought.<br />
In all our previous attempts at packing, our best time had been around three hours. This was not only unsuitable for some of our needs, it would mean missing one or more of our departure times. But for the fist time, our striking and packing of the baggage car took less than two hours. It was reason to celebrate.<br />
Neil, Julie, Analisa, and I tried to celebrate (after returning to the hotel) by finding either the VIA crew, or the rest of our CBC crew. This brought us to Overdrive, a bar a few blocks north of our hotel. We arrived at the front door, all donning some sort of CBC outerwear. When they tried to ding us for a cover charge, Analisa went to work&#8230;<br />
Doorman: Two bucks.<br />
Analisa: We&#8217;re with the CBC. How about just letting us in?<br />
Doorman: What&#8217;s the CBC? [Yes, he actually said that.]<br />
Analisa: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation?<br />
Doorman: [Blank stare.]<br />
Analisa: CBC TV?<br />
Doorman: [Blank stare.]<br />
Analisa: Hockey Night in Canada??<br />
Doorman: Oh, you guys do that? Okay, yeah, you can go in.<br />
I think if you looked closely enough, you could have seen Analisa doing the Jedi mind trick.<br />
Once we bypassed the cover charge, we came to realize that we were all too old. This took about 20 seconds. The music was earbleedingly loud (and nauseatingly bad), the oldest person looked about 10 years younger than me (and I&#8217;m the youngest of the four of us), and we couldn&#8217;t find a single VIA or CBC person there. We felt like narcs wandering around &#8230; &#8216;course all the stares we were getting didn&#8217;t help much. We wisely abandoned the place and headed back towards the hotel. That&#8217;s when we found Fred, and we headed to our venue of the evening.Jax used to be a warehouse. In the years since storage, it&#8217;s probably been many things. The second floor is now Jax, a rather strange little nightclub. Strange because it&#8217;s gaudy. I think that&#8217;s also it&#8217;s appeal &#8212; people go to Jax to avoid the brain-vibrating noise of other clubs. Most of the walls are painted in near-atrocious colours, purely for the fact that at about 23:00, the black lights come on, and everything lights up. There&#8217;s nothing like a neon nightclub to set things right.<br />
By 01:00, everyone who had left the hotel (which was almost our entire crew, including VIA on-train staff) were at Jax. Most had taken to the dance floor for their song of choice. (Neil requested &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221; before hunting down the Technical Crew at another venue not far away.) To say the music mix was eclectic is to say Frank Zappa was a little off-kilter. Destiny Child&#8217;s &#8220;Bootylicious&#8221; followed by Ozzy Ozbourne&#8217;s &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221; only to be upstaged by Eminem&#8217;s &#8220;Without Me&#8221; certainly does make the mind wonder.<br />
I ended up leaving early. I have a slightly distorted sense of duty, mostly because I have to get these entries back to Toronto for publishing on the website. And hey, for 15 minutes of fame, I certainly will go that extra mile. It&#8217;ll probably be my only chance.</p>

Day 6<br />
Most Canadians have heard of Biggar, Saskatchewan. Well maybe they haven&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m sure they know someone from Biggar. It&#8217;s the home of Olympic gold medal curler, Sandra Schmirler. While I doubt that&#8217;s what brought us to the small town of barely 2,500, we more than happy to have visited.<br />
Colleen Jones joined us this morning to do her broadcast. Because her broadcast is featured from 06:00 to 08:00 Eastern time, many of us were up at 03:30 Biggar time to set up stairs and access to the museum, turn lights on, and be available in case something is needed. Luckily, I was not up this morning. We&#8217;ll be pulling early mornings for the next couple of days (my turn will likely be tomorrow).<br />
Although we were to start at 09:00, people started arriving at 06:30. We started early. I guess there&#8217;s not much to do in Biggar, and something like this attracts a lot of attention. By the time I woke up, at least 30 people had already toured the museum. We were such a large attraction that entire classes of children appeared in small school buses to view the exhibits. I wished we could have done a full event.<br />
The kids knew we were coming to Biggar. They&#8217;d seen the information on CBC&#8217;s website and made plans for it. The interesting thing is &#8212; the town of Biggar didn&#8217;t know until not long before we arrived. Had the town known, so they told us, we would have waked that morning to a home-style pancake breakfast. While we loved the VIA food, there&#8217;s something to be said for pancakes. We turned like ravenous wolves on the management to make sure that succeeding towns knew we were coming.<br />
But the major and the town council still showed up. I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;d found out we&#8217;d be there through &#8220;official&#8221; channels, or if they&#8217;d been asked to come down for Colleen&#8217;s broadcast. All I do know is that the mayor gave each of us pins and keychains bearing the town&#8217;s slogan: &#8220;New York is big, but this is Biggar&#8221;.<br />
The town&#8217;s slogan is actually the result of a joke. An American survey crew visiting the town in 1909, after spending a little too much time in a tavern, wrote it on a sign. But instead of being offended, the townspeople rather liked the idea, and adopted it as their own.<br />
Frank Leahy and Friends were in their element here. In most places, they have people who like the music, tap their feet, and listen. Here, the people participated. Frank even dressed up in a light blue plaid shirt and jeans for the occasion. Kids visiting from one of the schools even got the band to play the theme to &#8220;Hockey Night In Canada&#8221;. Definitely a different tune when played with a fiddle.<br />
Due to the lack of activity at the train, I took the opportunity to find the Sandra Schmirler park. Asking a woman whom I thought was native to the area, I not only engaged myself in riveting conversation but also found someone to drive me to the park. It turned out that the woman and her husband were not from Biggar &#8212; they had driven over an hour from North Battleford just to see the train. (But they weren&#8217;t the long-distance champions. Some people came over six hours to see us.)<br />
The Sandra Schmirler Olympic Gold Medal park is subdued. Somehow, I doubt Biggar nor Sandra&#8217;s family would have allowed it to be any other way. It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s playground. Biggar wanted a nice, safe playground that everyone could enjoy. It&#8217;s large. I wish I had a playground like that growing up. The park will serve many generations of Biggarites (Biggarians?) to come.<br />
Biggar has got to be the most friendly place I&#8217;ve ever been. Everyone is happy to see you. And if you look like you&#8217;re lost, people will not only direct you, but offer to drive you to where you want to go without you having to ask. It&#8217;s difficult to say &#8220;no&#8221;. Walking back to the train was difficult. Not because it was far, but because I had to politely refuse rides from nearly every car that passed. Biggar&#8217;s hospitality is near-legendary, and for good reason. The walk back also gave me a chance to see small town Canada more closely. Living in places such as Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Calgary, I rarely get to see what rural Canada is truly like.<br />
I walked down Main Street (missing the Biggar Museum, only because I didn&#8217;t know about it), taking in the glory of Biggar. Think I&#8217;m joking? Then you&#8217;ve never been to a small prairie town. There&#8217;s a calm, relaxing air about this sort of a town. You feel calm, and completely safe. These people probably don&#8217;t even have locks on their doors. They don&#8217;t know the troubles or the pressures of the big cities. That kind of peace is hard to find.<br />
At the foot of Main Street is the railway station, originally built by the Grand Trunk Northern Railway in the early 1900s. It became a CN station when Grand Trunk was taken over, and used until CN abandoned its passenger service and VIA took over. CN closed the station, forcing VIA to a small &#8220;hut&#8221; next door, which served barely more for a ticket office and waiting room. In 1995, the VIA station was closed. VIA no longer serves Biggar. It was apparently quite a fight to get the train to stop there.<br />
I found Angela and Tracy standing on the road in front of the station, holding one of our CBC signs. Apparently, we originally were to stop at the station, but due to logistics, ended up on the south side of the yard, next to a fertilizer plant. Tracy and Angela were directing traffic to the south side. But only Tracy was wearing her black CBC crew shirt &#8212; Angela was sporting the newest fashion craze: a T-shirt emblazoned with the Biggar town logo. The woman parked next to them told me I could find her back at the train, which was where I left my wallet.<br />
While taking photographs of the old Grand Trunk Northern railway station (I love the look of old railway stations), I ran into my friends from North Battleford. Again, they offered me the chance to ride back to the train. Our train was on the opposite side of a very large rail yard, which I could only cross about a kilometre away. This time, I accepted. It was either that, or risk crossing the tracks. And it&#8217;s a big yard.<br />
Biggar is a major divisional point on the Canadian National Railway. It used to be much larger, featuring a large roundhouse, car shop, and bunkhouse. Today, it&#8217;s a crew change location &#8212; CN maintains a newer modern bunkhouse on the north side of the yard. The roundhouse still stands, but today houses a turkey farm that processes 100,000 birds every year. (Luckily for us, it was empty for our arrival. We were told the smell is something to behold. The mayor had been extremely annoyed when he found out we were being sided downwind from the farm.)<br />
When I returned to the train, the T-shirts were on sale. They featured two designs: the town logo, and a cartoon of New York with the caption &#8220;Big&#8221; next to a cartoon of the town with the caption &#8220;Biggar&#8221;. The daughter of one of the curators had made the design while a starving artist in New York. We bought most of her supply.<br />
Eleven o&#8217;clock arrived too quickly, and time to pack up again. We wanted to stay around longer &#8212; Biggar was such a nice place, and we were certain we could entertain the entire town. But schedules must be kept on a railway. It was off to Saskatoon.<br />
The VIA station in Saskatoon is in the south end of the city. On one side are a few houses (mostly industrial space), the other farmland. But the platform is large, and the station building available. Although we had no show in Saskatoon today, we did get an early start for tomorrow. It&#8217;s a seven hour show we&#8217;re putting on, and the less time we spend setting up, the more energy we&#8217;ll have.<br />
Colleen wants to broadcast from the train again tomorrow, and wants to showcase the New Media set up. That meant we had to do a complete set-up so we&#8217;d be ready for tomorrow morning. Or rather, so Colleen would be ready. And I need to be there. I wasn&#8217;t really asked to be there, at least not directly. Funny thing about responsibility, though &#8212; it&#8217;ll get you out of bed at really early hours of the morning. I might not be a full employee of the CBC, but I want New Media to look good.<br />
By 17:00, we had set up what we could and cleared out for our hotel. Showered and feeling better, several of us headed down the road to a railroad-themed restaurant, where we indulged in good dinner and great conversation. We started off strong, but towards the end we were beginning to drop like flies. Neil was the first to exit, nearly falling asleep onto his steak.</p>

Day 5<br />
A year ago today, North America&#8217;s security blanket was ripped away, and we were thrust into the global issue of terrorism. Today was a solemn day &#8212; one that Canada has been working towards for a week. Even before I left Calgary, there had been talk of &#8220;September 11th&#8221;, or &#8220;9/11&#8221; as I&#8217;ve often heard it. Funny how the media likes to place &#8220;cute&#8221; names on something so tragic.<br />
I wrote of the [[Reaction to September 11, 2001 (9/11)|event]]. I wrote how I&#8217;d seen people I&#8217;ve worked with for two years left in a complete daze, how little work we actually accomplished, and how I&#8217;d spent hours in front of the television when I&#8217;d got home, just so I could see the same horrific images over and over. Suffice to say, I had more than a few moments of pause a year ago.<br />
Today is considerably different. No-one mentioned anything about today&#8217;s anniversary. It wasn&#8217;t acknowledged by anyone with the CBC or VIA. At least, not on the train. The broadcast media, CBC included, did do their part to mark the occasion; we did not acknowledge the CBC&#8217;s anniversary &#8212; we simply moved on with our day. I didn&#8217;t even really remember the date until later in the day; but I heard not a peep from anyone.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: How could I possibly forget? As bad as it sounds, I was a little preoccupied with a few problems on my laptop that needed resolving. Remember the problem Daryl had? Just when I thought I&#8217;d had the problem licked, it hit me too.<br />
I hate computers.<br />
I had to get my computer fixed. I needed to get caught up in journals and photos to upload to the New Media group for the website. But with my system giving me trouble, writing was a significantly larger challenge. Especially with the looming departure deadline. This didn&#8217;t exactly make me a happy camper.<br />
The process I&#8217;m currently using is one we&#8217;d worked out some time ago. I take a template, write out the text, insert the images, and then upload the files to the server to be seen. But editing the template has been extraordinarily difficult, and the upload to the server agonizingly slow. It&#8217;s taken me upwards of an hour just to handle this simple task. And with limited range on the wireless systems, I&#8217;ve been running quite franticly trying to get it done.<br />
One of the things I had wanted to do today with my free time was to visit the Alberta Railway Museum. As I&#8217;d begun in Kamloops, I was going to make a go of doing as much historical rainfanning as possible. Given, I live in Alberta &#8212; Edmonton is about three hours away from my home. But you have to take advantage of situations when they present themselves. My computer, however, needed my attention. That kept me busy for hours, not only ruining my plans, but also setting back my publishing schedule for these journal entries.<br />
Our official goodbye to Enza took place as we boarded our vans to head back to the train. It&#8217;s amazing just how much our team has gelled since we first met a week ago. I feel sorry for Enza &#8212; she wanted to stay on, but couldn&#8217;t spend any more time away from her job. (Like myself, Enza is not with the CBC.) I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;d feel like if I&#8217;d had to leave early.<br />
We left our hotel at 14:30. Having loaded the night before, there was little to do but climb aboard and settle in. I continued to wrestle with my electronic arch-nemesis until we were out of Edmonton&#8217;s wireless communications range. While I did lose out on the wireless connection, I did win the battle and restored functionality to my computer. That earned me my first break in the day.<br />
The single largest problem the crew has when we&#8217;re on the train is entertainment. We often have long stretches of time between stops, and time before bed, with little to do. Some read books, some listen to music, others play games. Remember, we&#8217;re in a ten-foot wide, nine-foot tall steel can with windows. There&#8217;s not much in here, and for a generation brought up on television and living with Internet addictions, idle time is painful.<br />
Tonight, we decided to do something different. One of the advantages of travelling with Frank Leahy and Friends is goading them into doing something. Tonight, we convinced them to lead a jam session in the Bullet Lounge of the Banff Park car.<br />
A few nights earlier, Neil had passed me a CD. It was a little bit country, and a little bit rock &#8216;n roll. It was Neil &#8212; an album he&#8217;d recorded. At first, I didn&#8217;t even recognize the voice. He has a singing voice that should be selling records. Tonight was a chance for him to show everyone what he could do. The rest of us joined in on songs that we knew, and picked up on choruses that were fairly easy to figure out. And we could clap along without too much difficulty.<br />
Naturally, Daryl and his camera were everywhere. He wanted to get as much of this on film as possible. But so did Rob W., whose old-school VHS camcorder is beginning to be a familiar sight. That&#8217;s not counting the dozen or so still cameras that popped flashes for the next two and a half hours.<br />
The band did some music on their own, and sometimes included featured guests, including Neil, and two of the VIA people: Fred and Dennis. Dennis plays with a band in Vancouver, and has the most beautiful singing voice I&#8217;ve heard in years. Of Jamaican background, he regularly pushed &#8220;Frank and the Boys&#8221; to new heights by playing reggae and rock songs. There&#8217;s nothing more interesting than listening to &#8220;Brown Eyed Girl&#8221; being played with a reggae rhythm by a band that primarily plays fiddle music.<br />
People slowly began to trickle out after a while, until finally the small handful that remained called it a night. Tomorrow will be another long day. Colleen Jones joins us for CBC Morning, we have an event in Biggar, and we arrive in Saskatoon tomorrow night. No rest for the weary.</p>

Day 4<br />
There was a neighbourhood outside my lower berth window. As we weren&#8217;t moving, I could only assume we had arrived in Edmonton. At first I thought that maybe we hadn&#8217;t completely arrived yet &#8212; the sound of airplanes flying overhead was misleading. Further investigation revealed that the Edmonton VIA station is across 121st Street from the Edmonton City Centre airport. It&#8217;s only used for small planes.<br />
Our event would be from 15:30 to 20:00, giving us ample time to set up our tents and displays. Even then, people started arriving at 10:00. It seems that no matter where we go, people want to come early for the big show.<br />
The VIA station has a large field next to it (for what reason, I don&#8217;t know). This was an ideal location for putting out all our equipment. The local CBC had already erected a large tent (for news broadcasts, a stage for the band, and for serving a free barbecue dinner). We filled in the area around it.<br />
Our first injury came in the late morning. Bill, one of our technical crew, strained his knee. While not sounding serious, at first we were worried he&#8217;d popped it out. He was taken to a hospital where the injury was proclaimed a strain, and Bill was told to take it easy. There was a time when we thought we would lose Bill for the remainder of the journey. (And during take down in the evening, we really noticed Bill&#8217;s absence.)<br />
I hopped constantly from setting up displays (I ended up leaving CJ being the only person setting up for quite some time) and doing user support. I needed to repair Daryl&#8217;s computer. Without it, he couldn&#8217;t edit video, and that would put him far behind schedule. While I was fiddling around with Windows 2002, I was also talking with technical support in Toronto trying to sort out why our wireless connections weren&#8217;t working.<br />
I think I&#8217;m going to become a luddite. That way I won&#8217;t have to deal with computers any more. I hate computers.<br />
While on the phone with nearly everyone in CBC&#8217;s IT department, we managed to find the culprit to our computer woes. (A very odd conflict between printer driver and the CD-ROM burning software.) Within minutes, Daryl&#8217;s computer was running again. Before I could solve the wireless problems, though, I was called back into the field to finish setting up the nine computers in the New Media tent.<br />
More support calls. But this time to get the passwords to access the kiosk computers. Six of them had a rather annoying bug that prevented people from using our ShowVote application. An easy fix, but without the password I couldn&#8217;t edit the file. Then the Archives needed a small fix, which required another password. Unfortunately, that came too late to make this show. Next time.<br />
Advertising had gone well in Edmonton. The field was full of visitors. For the first time, our tent was busy. Our volunteer, Rob, was outstanding. He worked almost every person coming through, managed to give away hundreds of pens and bookmarks, helped out countless people, and stuck around helping with take down. Rob even showed us a thing or two about giving things away &#8212; tucking a pair of bookmarks under the penclip suddenly meant we could dispose of even more bookmarks. We actually had to tell him to go home. I wish we could take him with us.<br />
Line-ups were many. The museum line, like in Kamloops, was enormous. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people saw the exhibits, but we estimate about 2,000 visitors walked through in the four and a half hours. The line for the free barbecue was even larger. At one point, there must have been at least 300 people waiting for their dinner.<br />
The Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, the Honourable Lois E. Hole, came out to visit. She was interviewed by the CBC, as were several other celebrities including Dakota House (of North of 60 fame) and Sharon Lewis from ZeD.<br />
People kept arriving, right until 20:00. I felt sad for having to turn people away. But we needed to pack everything back into the train. Although we were staying in hotel, the train needed to move from the station &#8212; though for what reason I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Either way, we&#8217;re not about to leave our equipment outside all night.<br />
The sun set, the temperature dropped, and the wind picked up. We didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to shiver &#8212; we were too busy paking everything up, and hauling it back to the train. The crew had to pull the lights not long after it got dark, requiring flashlights to make sure we didn&#8217;t miss anything. Soon, the field was (relatively empty) and all that was left was to put everything back on the train. That was right about when my left forearm started going numb. It wasn&#8217;t from the cold &#8212; I think it&#8217;s Repetitive Strain Injury. Having spent the last half of my life parked in front of a computer, I suspect my forearms are due for total seizure before too long. Add that with hauling a lot of heavy boxes and stands around for a few hours a day&#8230;<br />
Finally, around 23:30, we broke for the hotel. We were all exhausted. Especially Neil, who had stayed up until 02:00 the previous night until the train was in Edmonton. He slept during the drive to the hotel.<br />
Several of us started to gather in the hotel&#8217;s atrium to sit, relax, share stories and a few drinks. We ate pretty much nothing but peanuts. The conversation was lively, and even after a hard day no-one seemed to be tired &#8212; mentally, that is. The group would carry on until well into the morning; I headed to long before them.<br />
Tonight, we bade farewell to Enza. She is the first of our group to rotate out. Enza was one of our coordinators and Jill of all trades. When we needed something done, there was Enza. She now returns to her life in Banff. Of course, we wish her well.</p>

Day 3<br />
I awoke to the sun peeking through my blind. Outside, the sky was partly cloudy, the sun climbing over the mountains, and elk traipsing through the CN rail yard. It was then I remembered the morning activity.<br />
The night before, Ivan had suggested we visit a glacier while we were in the area. Most of the group had never seen a glacier before, and it would have been shame to have the time and not use it well. I&#8217;d visited the Athabasca Glacier two years ago, but hadn&#8217;t been to any others. Besides, I&#8217;m a sucker for a side-trip. I hauled myself out of bed and went to see if plans had formulated during my rest. Ivan came through with a plan to see Mouth Edith Cavell.<br />
I skipped breakfast, preferring to take in the gorgeous Jasper morning (the last time I&#8217;d been there, it was overcast almost the entire time), take a few pictures, and walk around a bit before our shuttles appeared. That&#8217;s not to say that our food service has not been exquisite. VIA&#8217;s Chef Paul has an uncanny ability to create a meal that could make Ghandi break a fast. (Yes, that was a pun. Deal with it.)<br />
Our tour buses (vans that can hold ten passengers) arrived and whisked us away. Our guide, Murray, had been in the area for 14 years and was an expert on Jasper National Park. He began his tour as soon as we pulled away from the train. This involved local history, descriptions of flora and fauna, and stories of things he&#8217;d seen and done, peppered with answers to questions we asked along the way. And we had time &#8212; Mount Edith Cavell is fairly close to Jasper, but as it is a mountain, there&#8217;s a 45-minute trip to the start of the hike. There was plenty to see and hear along the way.<br />
Part of the drive was along the original Icefields Parkway, built by Depression-era labourers. By hand. Back then, heavy equipment was too expensive or too difficult to use in the area. Besides, it kept hundreds of men working at a time. Eventually, the road was replaced with a faster, more modern road. The original still serves a vital connection into the mountainous areas, and allows visitors a chance to get closer to the natural beauty of the parks.<br />
The temperature was noticeably cooler when we arrived at the parking lot near the base of Edith Cavell. We gathered into our respective groups (one per van), and headed out to the trails. One went up on the lateral morraine, allowing a spectacular view of the valley, the other along the valley floor. Both under the nose of the mountain.<br />
Mount Edith Cavell is named for a World War I British nurse stationed in Brussels. When the German army occupied the Netherlands, she stayed behind to take care of the captured soldiers. What the German Army didn&#8217;t know was that she was also smuggling them out through an underground railway to safety. When the German Army found out what Edith was doing, she paid for her courage with her life. In tribute, the Canadian Geographic Board renamed one of the most majestic peaks in Jasper National Park in her name.<br />
Once upon a time, barely a few hundred years ago, ice filled the valley. With the changes in global weather (not all as a result of global warming), the ice has receded to form two glaciers: Angel Glacier, which flows along the bottom of the valley; and Ghost Glacier, which hangs down from the peak. In a few years, there won&#8217;t likely be any glacier left. It&#8217;s almost all melted.<br />
We met at the glacial pool. The view was unearthly. Shaped blocks of ice surrounded by jagged blocks of rock, a brisk wind, diminutive trees, and huge walls of rock and ice towering over our heads. The Athabasca Glacier had been a new experience two years ago. I didn&#8217;t think Edith Cavell would be much different. Instead, I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s something everyone physically capable should see.<br />
Having a time restriction, we couldn&#8217;t stay too long. After a few minutes at the pool (and retrieving a few stragglers who were venturing too close to the glacier&#8217;s edge), we made a hasty return to the train to begin set up for our afternoon event. It would be almost the same as the Kamloops event, just with a different station and train configuration. The trick was that most of the equipment we needed for the event was on the wrong side of the yard. A borrowed cube van solved that problem.<br />
While the others headed off to set up, I started trying to resolve a problem with our network connectivity. Among my duties is system support, liasing with the IT group in Toronto. CBC has spent a large amount of money trying to get us wireless network connectivity across Canada. However, we haven&#8217;t had a wireless signal since Vancouver. A few people were anxious to check email. Nearly two and a half hours of phone calls produced little more than an earache. It wasn&#8217;t IT&#8217;s fault &#8212; Telus, it seemed, didn&#8217;t have a compatible wireless network in Jasper.<br />
The earache became a major headache when Daryl&#8217;s computer began misbehaving. Oddly enough, about when we were testing the wireless connection using his system. (Daryl and I have the same model of computer. In fact, mine is a mirror of his. It&#8217;s meant as a backup should his ever suffer a catastrophic failure. My system, thankfully, hadn&#8217;t had the trouble Daryl did.) Soon, he was almost entirely unable to work on his video clips. Having a background in user support, I used my bag of virtual tricks to try and fix his laptop. But it rebelled, and soon I had to give up, lest I destroy his work. We will need to address it in Edmonton.<br />
Leaving the train, I headed over to the event to take pictures and help out. But help was not needed. Due to confusion in advertising, the event wasn&#8217;t properly promoted in Jasper. The crowds we expected were not to be had. We did attract a lot of tourists (especially when Frank Leahy and Friends were playing), but few of them had even heard of the CBC.<br />
The afternoon passed slowly. It drizzled periodically for flavour, and didn&#8217;t really ever get that warm. Rose wandered the streets passing the word. Debbie donned the Franklin the Turtle costume for the kids. (She tragically fell to the adolescent male dream of kicking a costume character in the groin. Luckily, she found it humorous. Hysterical, actually. To the point where the only reason she had to get out of the suit was that she couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Roger didn&#8217;t find it even remotely funny, and cast a bone-freezing stare at the boys when they came through the museum. He refused them access to &#8220;Be An Anchor&#8221; until they&#8217;d apologized to Franklin.)<br />
One thing that filtered out during the day was some of the previous night&#8217;s activities. (You hear all sorts of interesting stories as the day moves on.) Most of the crew ended up at the Athabee &#8212; that much you already know (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Kamloops]]). It&#8217;s what happened after we left&#8230; The group I was with managed to get back to the train. No harm there. The thought of looking for a bear apparently didn&#8217;t last long, and soon was abandoned. But that was us &#8230; the remainder of the band, however, had an interesting night.<br />
The story, or at least as I understand it, was that the band returned to the train after us. Only they didn&#8217;t take a taxi, and didn&#8217;t know the route around the rail yard. So they went through the middle of it, just missing an incoming freight train. They found their luck had held when told (upon reaching the train) that they had narrowly missed meeting a bear in the darkness of the yard.<br />
We mercifully closed down at 18:00, allowing us to get packed up and wait for the train to reform at the platform. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Jasper was really nice. But with so few people out in attendance, we really had very little to do. It was mostly for boredom that we wanted to pack up. I think all of us were concerned this might become a trend.<br />
The train pulled away from the station a couple of minutes behind schedule, and headed on its way eastward through the park. This was a stretch I&#8217;d wanted to see since my trip out last October. But sadly, it was dark by the time we&#8217;d reached Jasper Lake. It was too dark to see the Prairie Creek Trestle at all &#8212; though we could hear it very clearly. We passed Hinton without fanfare (or notice) and I was barely awake enough to spot Edson.<br />
Tomorrow is another day, and another full event.</p>

Day 2<br />
Most of us didn&#8217;t go to sleep right away. We may have climbed into bed, but those of us with windows opened our blinds, and watched the stars, the curving of the train, and the hollow blackness of the tunnels. The sharp blats of the horn echoed eerily in the treed valleys. It&#8217;s not a sound we&#8217;re used to hearing. All of this left us a little groggy when we awoke to the rising sun. Our train had arrived during the night, parking at the Lorne Street train station in Kamloops.<br />
Kamloops was our second show. This time we would only open the museum cars &#8212; what we called a partial event &#8212; we did not have enough time to do a full event. Even with the lessened load, we still had to set up stanchions, signage, and stairs in and out of the cars. It was a far easier show than the full event, for that we were thankful.<br />
Like with Vancouver, people arrived before we were ready. A lot of people in Kamloops are CBC fans &#8212; we soon had a line of hundreds of visitors. We were expecting the smaller communities to have proportionally larger turnouts, but this was a pleasant surprise.<br />
My job for the day, not having a group of computers to watch over, was greeting visitors and handing out stickers and tattoos for the kids. This was a welcome change of pace. The New Media tent is a little quiet, so having to welcome passers-by opened the door for conversation. Stefani and I guarded the north entrance, welcoming people and answering questions. It was also a chance to get to know another new friend.<br />
About an hour after the event began, I started my photography circuit. One of several duties, I take all the pictures for the website and for archival purposes. As I took pictures of the stage, I happened to notice an otherwise innocuous number just to the left of the stage&#8217;s awning: 2141. One of my personal tasks as this trip proceeds is to find vintage railway equipment. This was my first find: ex-CNR #2141, a 2-8-0 Consolidation steam locomotive.<br />
Entering the office, I inquired about the possibility of seeing the engine before the train left. Unfortunately for me, today was supposed to be an operational day for 2141. But since we were sitting at the station it would use, there would be no steam on the tracks today. Luckily, one of people in the storefront was the wife of one of 2141&#8217;s mechanics. She graciously volunteered to take me over to the train, housed in a shed barely 100 metres from our train.<br />
In retrospect, I wish I had taken my camera with me to take pictures of Julie and Neil&#8217;s faces when I asked if I could disappear for 15 minutes to take pictures. It was perhaps the most incredible look of &#8220;What???&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever seen. Up until that point, I don&#8217;t think either of them really knew just how much of a rail fan I am.<br />
For the last eight years, the Kamloops Heritage Railway have toiled over rebuilding the engine to working condition. It had been on static display in Riverside Park for 33 years, and needed a lot of work. When donated to the KHR, they had to reduce it to spare parts and start almost from scratch. Many of the parts had to be rebuilt. Just last year, the engine was moved to its current home where the Heritage society keeps loving care of it.<br />
The firebox was still warm from yesterday&#8217;s excursion. Every unpainted metal surface gleamed. (6060&#8217;s surfaces, by comparison, need a lot of cleaning and polishing.) I marvelled at the craftsmanship the Kamloops Heritage Railway had put into the rebuilding. 2141 looked like it had just rolled off the assembly line. Not bad for a 90 year-old.<br />
I had a short period of time, so took my pictures quickly. As I ran around the engine, my personal guide told me of the story of restoration. It was a tale I would love to tell, but there were simply too many details to remember. I need to remember to bring my notepad in the future.<br />
Returning to the train, we left 2141 sitting proudly in its house, a little engine that did.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t the only one working on side projects &#8212; Emma was off on a quest of her own. But it wasn&#8217;t to find a train. (I would find out later that Emma would have liked to come with me to see 2141. I&#8217;ll need to keep that in mind when we get to Montreal.) She was looking for the nearest bar. It sounded like a really good idea &#8212; get in a quick drink, and then off to our next exotic location! Capital thinking, I say.<br />
The line-up had continued to stretch during my time away, and we were only open for another hour. We felt sorry for those who wouldn&#8217;t make it into the museum before we had to close the doors. In hopes of lessening broken hearts, we started telling visitors that they might not be able to see the museum. Very few turned away. When the doors did finally close, those who were turned away were understanding. In all, we think about 1,200 people managed to go through the museum in the three hours!<br />
Being such a small event, we were able to pack up our things much more quickly. Within an hour, we were ready to leave. Only mid-afternoon, we were promised glorious sights as we headed into the mountain passes.<br />
So, of course, it rained.<br />
There&#8217;s something strangely comforting about rain. We sat in our cars, working, resting, playing, and glancing out through the water-streaked windows. The rain seemed to make the forests pop into life and the mountains to gleam. Everyone fell into a relaxation that made it feel like we&#8217;d been together far longer than we had. A few people read, some glanced out windows, Patrick even did some magic tricks. Apparently, he did a stint with the Cirque du Soliel!<br />
I spent some time in the dome, sitting near David and Paul. The two of them stared out the windows like the rest of us. But instead of looking for scenery, I think they were scanning for a punchline. Sure enough, it came when we passed a field full of horses. Paul&#8217;s comment: &#8220;[Those are] funny-looking cows&#8230;&#8221;<br />
The train snaked its way through the forests, stopping periodically to let a freight train pass. The rain dwindled as the light faded. Just before it got too dark to see anything, we were fortunate to pass Pyramid Falls. Too dark for a clear photograph, I opted for a short snippet of video. Daryl, our videographer / video producer, got a similar pass with his video camera. I can&#8217;t wait to see how clear his version is.<br />
We arrived in Jasper at about 23:00 MDT, well ahead of schedule. This left us ample time to have nightcap. When word circulated that bars were open until 02:00, almost the entire CBC crew fled to the Athabee &#8212; a bar in the Athabasca Hotel. The band nearly tripped over each other trying to get out of the train. I couldn&#8217;t move fast enough (we had to shut down all our computers so the train could be split), and had to wait until everything stopped moving.<br />
I waited for Neil, Julie, and Debbie to get everything sorted out before we walked over. As we waited, the VIA crew split the train. This doesn&#8217;t sound like much, until you&#8217;re near the brake line. It&#8217;s a loud bang when the line couplers come apart and the air-pressure explodes out. I&#8217;ve heard it many times. Debbie, however, had not. The sound caused her to leap about four feet in the air, near-screaming a Newfie blurt of surprise (something like &#8220;Geezusmarymurphy!&#8221;), leaving Julie, Neil, and I doubled over laughing.<br />
Confusion soon reigned. Julie and I somehow managed to lose Neil and Debbie. Then we couldn&#8217;t find everyone else. We checked surrounding bars, just in case. Nothing. We did find Richard, though, who had decided the bar wasn&#8217;t for him and was heading back to the train. We did eventually find the team, though, buried in a corner of the Athabee lounge. There we remained until roughly closing time.<br />
Our group, not only the CBC crew but also Frank Leahy and his band, are a lot of fun. There&#8217;s nothing more frustrating than travelling with people who don&#8217;t enjoy the journey. Part of every journey is stopping and smelling the roses. While we weren&#8217;t smelling all that great when we left, the time we spent sharing silly stories and making fun of each other was well worth the lost sleep we would experience.<br />
Things got more interesting when we tried to get back to the train. While we were at the Athabee, VIA cut the train in two pieces. The museum cars, the Banff Park, and the generator flat car were left at the station platform. The rest of the train, including our beds, were on the south side of a large, busy rail yard. As we left the train, VIA told us how to get back. But we couldn&#8217;t find a taxi, let alone the three or four we&#8217;d need. So we walked.<br />
It&#8217;s a long walk. You can&#8217;t (nor should) walk through a busy rail yard. That&#8217;s just asking for trouble. (Trains can come in very quickly, and without warning. Cars in the yard can start moving without sound. And you can&#8217;t see all the nasty stuff sitting on the ground.) Having run around the Jasper yard from my trip with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society last October (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]), I knew where we were going and how to get there. Wearing only a T-shirt in the nippy night air just made the trip a little more urgent.<br />
A few people in our rather large ensemble decided, upon arriving at the train, that they needed to find a bear. (The logic of drunk people is just stunning sometimes.) Knowing much better, I crawled into bed, and was soon dreaming of trains.</p>

Day 1<br />
I awoke this morning feeling quite drained from the last few days of toil, and the previous night&#8217;s sake. But within minutes of my rising, adrenaline was already flooding my veins. It was going to be a good day. That was assuming the weather held. It wasn&#8217;t looking very promising glancing out the window. The Weather Network said it wouldn&#8217;t rain. I wasn&#8217;t too sure. Many times I&#8217;ve seen the forecast proven wrong in Vancouver.<br />
Breakfast was early, and fast. We had to be checked out, with our bags at the train this morning. We would have no time to return to the hotel to get anything. By the time we arrived at the station at 7:40, the technical crew had already started pulling out our equipment. We had until 11:00 to get it all set up before the crowds started arriving. Though we had done it only once before, set up was becoming a practiced routine. We had little worries of making our deadlines.<br />
Through the chill of the overcast morning, we pitched tents, set up tables, erected stands, powered computers and televisions, and set out the giveaways. We didn&#8217;t have to wait long &#8212; the crowds arrived and were lining up before we were done. I&#8217;d been expecting more of a sudden flood of people as the doors officially opened, but that never happened. People just started showing up. Before long, we had people everywhere. It was a bona fide event.<br />
It looked like a small carnival. Only without animals. And rides. We had clowns, though, and lots of performers. So all in all, it wasn&#8217;t too far off. The show drew out friends of mine from Vancouver, including my friend Joel and his family. Joel nearly cried when he saw the Friendly Giant&#8217;s castle, and was thrilled to meet some of the local CBC celebrities. Joel is possibly the largest fan of the CBC I have ever met. And he doesn&#8217;t even watch hockey&#8230;<br />
Celebrities weren&#8217;t exactly out in droves, we had a lot more than I thought we would. The cast of Edgemont (a show that, admittedly, I&#8217;ve never heard of) were signing autographs. Not far away was the cast of Royal Canadian Air Farce. Brian Williams frequented the Sports tent, when he wasn&#8217;t wandering around meeting people. There was also another sports icon, whose name I&#8217;ve already forgot.<br />
The next five hours flitted by like hummingbirds &#8212; bobbing, weaving, and very quick. During that time, we entertained several thousand loyal CBC viewers and listeners. The only way we really knew time was passing was when bands changed. Most were good, but didn&#8217;t attract a lot of listeners. One band, Cherry Bomb, got attention by playing &#8220;Time After Time&#8221; and had people guess who they were covering (Cyndy Lauper). A lucky fan got a free CD.<br />
Our two museum cars, including the &#8220;Be An Anchor&#8221; exhibit were extremely popular. I have no idea how many people ultimately went through the cars, but those who did only raved about what we had brought along. For many, most my age, it was seeing the castle from The Friendly Giant, and the treehouse and Tickle Trunk from Mr. Dressup.<br />
As the day went on, the clouds parted and the sun blessed our celebration. The temperature rose along with spirits. But time was disappearing quickly, and the crew knew it. We were excited, and also nervous. We had a huge hurdle ahead of us, and I don&#8217;t think any of us felt confident enough to say that we would make our deadline. Positive outlooks, however, do wonders.<br />
Before we knew it, Colin James (the last performer) was taking the stage. That was our sign to start striking our sets. We had to take things apart discreetly, as not to interfere with the concert. It was a little tricky, though &#8212; we had to make sure our equipment was protected until collected for the train.<br />
When Colin James finished, the remaining crowds started to disperse, and we moved into high gear. The train was leaving at 19:00, with or without us. Our previous experience had told us that it would take an hour and a half to pack our equipment into the baggage car, not counting the time to strike our sets. The added complexity, however, was that we couldn&#8217;t just pack everything into the baggage car. Transport Canada rules (and VIA rules) stated we had to keep a corridor open so we could move through the baggage car.<br />
To avoid the problems of our last repack, Neil and the technical crew created a list of items in order of loading and unloading. This would prevent the flood of items appearing at the baggage car, and would suggest what order we had to pack things up. For CJ and I, this meant we had to pack computers early on &#8212; they were packed in the dark, secure recesses of the car &#8212; so they had to go in relatively early. We won&#8217;t see our computers again until Edmonton.<br />
We reloaded in less time. Almost. We would have if we didn&#8217;t have to create an access way through the car. The passage hadn&#8217;t existed before, and the crew had to whack together sheets of plywood and tie it all down before we could roll out. With a great deal of relief, we finished just in time for our departure.<br />
Boarding the Skyline car, I took a place in the dome along with most of the CBC crew. Some of us were very excited to begin our historic journey. Most were just happy to sit down after another hard day&#8217;s work. (Chris was the first person in the crew to take a shower, and looked much happier for it.) I bore a grin that ran ear-to-ear. Riding on trains is something I&#8217;ve always loved, and something that gets stronger with each year. My dream of riding coast-to-coast was about to start. I felt 10 years younger.<br />
A slight jerk, and the train started rolling forward. We waved to those still on the platform as we pulled away. We didn&#8217;t get too far, though &#8212; we needed to pick up our generator, which was waiting on the adjacent track. Once the VIA crew had done their brake test, we were officially off.<br />
As we slowly left the yard, I started to notice people standing on hills, bridges, piles of wood &#8212; whatever could be used to look over fences. Not a lot of people, just a small handful scattered about. Train chasers. They were following the train, and taking pictures. This time, I would be the fox instead of the hound.<br />
The trip out of the Lower Mainland has always been one I&#8217;ve wanted to take. However, the setting sun and rolling clouds reduced our visibility. It was dark by the time we reached Surrey. We never stopped looking out the window, though &#8212; everything was a wonder. We spent as much time staring at the passing lights of Greater Vancouver than we did at our dinner. I don&#8217;t even remember what it was. I think it was also a reward. After all the hard work everyone had put in, this beginning to the trip was a treat far tastier than the most decadent dessert.<br />
Travelling with us is Frank Leahy and his band &#8212; Richard, David, and Paul. The four of them have deadly humour streaks, as we&#8217;re beginning to find out. They kept us laughing most of the way out of the Lower Mainland. Having them as trainmates is a blessing.<br />
I haven&#8217;t been this excited about a trip since &#8230; well, it&#8217;s been so long that I can&#8217;t honestly remember the last time I&#8217;ve been so giddy. Neil and I are almost in competition to see who&#8217;s the most childish with glee. I think he&#8217;s ahead at the moment. But then, he&#8217;s been working on this a lot longer than I have. He definitely has reason to be happy.<br />
I think I may have a very difficult time getting off this train when we reach Halifax.</p>

		<p><cite> [This entry written by Geoff Sowrey, Â©2002 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Text used with permission of CBC. The opinions expressed within do not necessarily reflect those of the CBC, employees, affiliates, or subsidiaries.] </cite>T-Minus 1 day<br />
Unlike previous days&#8217; preparations, we would not haul equipment today. For this, we were very happy. Most of us sported bruises and strained muscles (the puncture wound in my left palm was still sore). A day of lessened physical activity was welcome. But we were not without tasks to accomplish.<br />
The first, and most important, was a safety briefing from VIA Rail. We would not be allowed on the train without it. It was so important that we were held to a tighter schedule than any previous day. The rules were similar to those I&#8217;d received last October when travelling with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society when taking our locomotive out to Jasper (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]). VIA&#8217;s rules are different than CN&#8217;s rules &#8212; mostly because we wouldn&#8217;t be working on the train itself, so some of the safety rules (such as hard hats, steel-toed boots, and safety vests) never came into play. (That said, I had a pair of steel-toed boots with me, just in case.)<br />
Fred and Marie-Claude, our VIA representatives, took us through the train and explained the details and the dangers the train, including specifics of each rail car. Among them: always wearing footwear. (Inside the cars weren&#8217;t such a danger, but going between cars could result in serious injury if you weren&#8217;t paying attention.) Water was rationed &#8212; we have a limited supply between stations. As such, showers are timed. We can&#8217;t flush toilets in stations, unless we&#8217;re told otherwise. (VIA&#8217;s Budd cars do not carry black water retention tanks &#8212; waste dumps directly onto the tracks.) And above all else: we had to be punctual. VIA&#8217;s trains run at the blessing of CN&#8217;s schedules; to vary the time of departure is to invite many delays.<br />
The briefing shifted from the train to a classroom in the Maintenance Centre. (The whiteboard was covered with instructions on how to perform a proper fill weld.) The safety briefing mostly took place here, with Earl conducting most of the more serious stuff. Daryl floated around the room, his video camera catching almost everything.<br />
We were to go to CBC&#8217;s Vancouver office at 10:30 for an employee celebration. The orientation ran long, however, and we ended skipping the party. No-one seemed to mind too much, preferring to take the afternoon off for relaxing and get in a little sight-seeing. It would be our last day before the trip fully began, and some had never been to Vancouver before.<br />
For me, it was time to do laundry. I had been away from home already for a week, and I doubted I would be able to wash clothes before Edmonton. Luckily, the Holiday Inn had three washing machines, none of which were in use. All I had to do was obtain change (which I got from the front desk) and some laundry soap. Fabric softener, for the traveller, is a bit of a luxury item. That, and I was too lazy to buy any. A tiresomely trivial task, I did allow myself time during the dry cycle to get lunch at Kitto, a Japanese Restaurant on Granville Street.<br />
Post-laundry was my Vancouver photo shoot. Having lived in Vancouver for two years, I was already familiar with the sights I wanted. So why bother taking pictures? For starters, I didn&#8217;t really have any decent pictures of Vancouver. It&#8217;s a common theme &#8212; you never take pictures of the city you live in. Part of my job is to take pictures for the trip, and because we&#8217;re in Vancouver, I need pictures of this city for the website. But also because I knew a lot of the people on the trip wouldn&#8217;t get to see very much, and I wanted them to see what Vancouver has to offer.<br />
I moved quickly from the hotel down to Burrard Inlet to obtain a panorama of the harbour and mountains. I passed Amy and Chris coming the other direction. I guess they didn&#8217;t see me, as I said &#8220;hello&#8221; and got nothing in return. (Mind you, they claim the opposite. Who knows what happened!) I took pictures of the waterfront, then moved down to Waterfront Station (CPR&#8217;s second railway station in Vancouver) for a few more pictures. Then it was to nearby Gastown for a picture of the neighbourhood and the famous steam clock. I thought about a return visit to Granville Island, but I decided the pictures I shot there (see [[Visiting More in Vancouver]]) were good enough.<br />
By the time I returned to the hotel, my feet were pounding. The activities of the last few days had turned my poor feet to greasy spoon-grade hamburger. They, and I, needed a rest. I thought about just sitting around until the feeling came back into my soles, but I made the mistake of laying down for a moment when dropping things off in my room.<br />
I woke just before 17:30, which was when we were meeting at Panama Jack&#8217;s, a bar attached to the Holiday Inn. There, the Executive Producer of the 50th Anniversary Project, Pia Marquard held a cocktail party for we brave souls.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t really met Pia before, having only heard her name a couple of times. I expected a stereotypical television producer. Instead, I found her a wonderful person to talk to &#8212; and she was actually interested in things I had to say! Not being a CBC employee, I&#8217;ve never dealt with a television producer before. All the stories I hear about producers generally make them evil in ways that chill even the hardiest of souls. I felt a lot better about the trip when I realized the person in charge really cared about what we did.<br />
At least until she mentioned that she produced the first Survivor. We all laughed, nervously.<br />
We toasted the work we had already done, commented on the work that was yet to come, and lauded Julie and Neil. They truly are our Fearless Leaders, pulling a very large rabbit out of a very small hat. I just hope that all of their hard work is seen by as many Canadians as we hope to see. It would be a tragedy if all these efforts go to waste.<br />
CJ and I also had a detente, and reconciled. I was very happy to put our disagreement behind us and move forward. We have to rely on each other extensively to pull this little trick off, and having two people at odds with each other was only heading towards disaster.<br />
Everyone talked, mingled, tried to get to know one another a little better, and snacked a little on the pub fare circulating the premises. But when you&#8217;re in a city like Vancouver, bar food really doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. I mean, when you&#8217;re in a world-class city, you want to eat world-class food. It sounds a little petty, perhaps, but it really does add to the experience.<br />
For the last couple of days, Emma and I had been discussing the need for good sushi. Although I&#8217;d had some for lunch, there is no comparison, no contest for good sushi. Luckily, Emma and I knew of a place: Hiro. Or at least that&#8217;s what we thought it was called. No entries in the phone book, nothing even hinted of by the hotel staff. How Emma eventually found it, I&#8217;m not sure. I can be certain that after all this grief, I&#8217;ll never forget the name &#8220;Shiro&#8221; again.<br />
We would have been off with eight others, but suddenly our sushi crew disappeared on us. Emma and I had to settle for an evening gorging ourselves on what we think is the best sushi in the Lower Mainland, and possibly Canada. Fresh unfrozen tuna, fresh wild Pacific salmon, and rolls so luscious that I still salivate at the thought. Two bottles of sake only added to the experience. (And also got up the gumption to try deep-fried shrimp heads. Although surprisingly tasty, they are slightly unattractive.)<br />
We pitied those who decided to go somewhere else. We took pictures for posterity. And for gloating.<br />
We wanted to stay much longer. Have more sake, eat more sushi, try other things on the menu. Responsibility tends to put a damper on things, and we ended up leaving after only a couple of hours. Tonight, we will sleep well. For tomorrow, the show begins.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 2 days<br />
I think it&#8217;s safe to say no-one left today&#8217;s event pain-free. This was the VIP Event day. This  was when we had to be near perfect, as the executives from both CBC and VIA would be on hand,  along with many other invited parties and members of the media. We had to shine. We had to be  as close to perfect as we could be, considering none of us had put our displays together  before.<br />
One thing this day did bring was an introduction to Catherine (also known as CJ), my tent-mate.  I&#8217;m responsible for New Media and Showvote. CJ covers the Archives material.<br />
Somehow, I ended up being the tent chief. That just means I get to carry a walkie-talkie. It&#8217;s  the first time I&#8217;ve ever carried a walkie-talkie. There&#8217;s an etiquette to using walkie-talkies,  which includes using &#8220;roger&#8221; and &#8220;over&#8221; during transmissions, and waiting for others to finish  conversations. It&#8217;s fun, but I was always a little nervous before broadcasting to the crew.<br />
We started in the morning hauling out all the equipment, and then putting it all together. By  11:00, we&#8217;d had almost everything in place. This surprised even me, considering we had nine  computers, and an awkward (and heavy) central triangular stand. Yet CJ, Brenda, and I managed  to put it all together. We tweaked the configurations well into the afternoon, though,  finishing just as the executives began their walkaround.<br />
One of the purposes of the VIP event was to raise awareness of CBC Television&#8217;s 50th  anniversary. The other was to provide the official kick-off, including a ribbon-cutting  ceremony. I&#8217;ve never been to one that large. It&#8217;s a bit of a thrill, despite the  pretentiousness.<br />
Volunteers started arriving about 30 minutes before the start of the event. These were local  people, either from the CBC or from local schools. Our volunteers, Jaiman and Peter, were both  students who received the call through email. They didn&#8217;t need to do much &#8211; just ensure that  people were able to use the systems. Other volunteers needed to watch activities and help hand  out giveaways.<br />
Among the crowd were several celebrities, mostly with the CBC. Announcements came from Ian  Hanomansing and Gloria Macarenko, both of whom feature prominently on CBC news. The big speeches  came from Brian Williams (of CBC Olympic coverage fame) and Luba Goy from the Royal Canadian  Air Farce.<br />
Ms. Goy seems to have two settings: On and Really On. When motioned to stretch her speech due  to time restrictions (we were going live with Canada Now, and had to synchronize our activities  with their schedule), she dove off into tangents and accents that had many people crying.<br />
Finally, the moment came, and Carole Taylor, the Chair of the CBC, took centre stage. A very  eloquent woman (but with some trouble annunciating French), she made a wonderful speech about  how CBC has changed Canada and moulded Canadian culture. (If you don&#8217;t think so, answer this:  can you hum the theme to Hockey Night In Canada? The Friendly Giant? Do you know what a Tickle  Trunk is?)<br />
Following Ms. Taylor was the Honourable Jean Pelletier, the chair of VIA Rail Canada. Mr.  Pelletier&#8217;s speech echoed the thoughts of Ms. Taylor&#8217;s, but with a decidedly stronger slant to  railroads.<br />
At the end of this speech, Ms. Taylor and Mr. Pelletier took a place in front of the ribbon,  while Luba and Brian finished off the ceremony. Then all eyes turned to the gold scissors as  they cut the tape away, opening the train, and starting our journey.<br />
The event soon faded away as people went through the train, and disappeared into the oncoming  evening. We were to wrap up at 19:30, but a couple tents started at 19:00. This, sadly, caused  me some friction that nearly ruined a good team.<br />
I was using Neil as my touchstone for when things were to happen. According to Neil, we were to  strike at 19:30. So I wanted to hold off. However, CJ was told to start striking. This caused  miscommunication, and temperatures rose far higher than should have been allowed.<br />
We persevered through the difficulties, and finished packing up. This is where we ran into our  second snag. Having never fully repacked the baggage car, we didn&#8217;t brought everything back all  at once. This has the effect of trying to empty a bathtub into a garden hose all at once.<br />
Gerry (our Crew Chief) managed the repacking, but had to make a lot of decisions when faced  with the flood of returned equipment set materials. It took nearly an hour and a half, but  finally the last item disappeared into the baggage car. Total time: nearly three hours. Two  times as long as we had hoped for. (In Winnipeg, we have only an hour and a half to do the same  job.) Although disappointed, we were too tired and too sore to worry too much.</p>

		<p>T-minus 3 days<br />
I awoke with my alarm ready for a day of discovery. That was important because I had only met three people in the crew of 30-odd. When I arrived in the restaurant for breakfast, I stared at a seemingly endless sea of unfamiliar faces. I ate breakfast alone, partly because I still have a weird shyness complex, and also because I needed to review my notes. (If anyone asks, I&#8217;m sticking with the latter reason.)<br />
Walking into this entire affair, I&#8217;d had many questions and concerns. I had many reservations. I didn&#8217;t know whom I could rely on for help. Over the last two months, I came to know the management of this project. With that familiarity came comfort that things were under control. Today just reinforced that.<br />
I boarded the shuttle to Pacific Central station, barely knowing a person. I didn&#8217;t even know who my tent-mate was. I had talked to her on the phone, but you really don&#8217;t get an impression for them with a short conversation. We had work to do, and all I could do was just follow the crowd and fill in the blanks as I went along.<br />
The first big help was courtesy of Ivan, the Museum curator. He had made name tags for everyone in the crew so we wouldn&#8217;t have so much trouble with names. (And also so guests would know who were are.) Besides, &#8220;Hi My Name Is&#8221; stickers look a little goofy.<br />
We started off slowly &#8212; there was little we could do until VIA switched our train (or as much of it as was available) into the station so we could start unloading our stuff. Everyone milled. Some people knew others, but many (like myself) were total strangers. I figured out who Daryl was early on &#8212; he had the video camera. Ivan and I met in the opening stages, as well, learning that we were both part of historical rail societies.<br />
This was our first practical introduction to everything we have to work with over the next 37 days. Some of us had attended a meeting in Toronto a couple of weeks earlier that included basics with the tent. I saw a video. So actually getting a chance to fully set the equipment up was not only important, but helpful.<br />
I had never been on VIA&#8217;s Budd cars before. (These are the stainless steel passenger cars most visible on The Canadian.) Formerly of the Canadian Pacific Railway, VIA inherited the cars when taking over passenger service in Canada. As we wandered through the cars, it suddenly became real. This was really happening.<br />
For the last two months, I was living in a bit of a daze. When Brenda had approached me with this project, I felt like someone had a conduit into my dreams. Though I was active in planning and development, I still felt separated. Now I was in the thick of it. These were the people on the train. I would work and live with them for over a month. This was the train. There was no doubt any more, not even a hint of possibility. This was it.<br />
Today was my introduction to the team. I hovered rather than directly introduced, allowing time for acceptance and for adjustment. The team is going to be everything for the next month, and I want to get off on a good start. Besides, I don&#8217;t want to bombard them with the Full Geoff. (Sometimes, I&#8217;m a little much.)<br />
We set up tents in the morning. The original plan was to do full set ups and strikes (taking everything down) as many times as possible so we&#8217;d be comfortable with the system. But an unexpected arrival of the Rocky Mountaineer from Kamloops derailed us, and we had to stop.<br />
During our break, Earl (the director of VIA&#8217;s Vancouver Maintenance Centre) took us into the maintenance building to see our lead locomotive. VIA #6403, a GMD F40PH-2 diesel electric locomotive, sat in its CBC 50th Anniversary decaled glory. It sat proud, looking like a cat that had just finished cleaning itself, ready for petting.<br />
After lunch, we emptied the baggage car and made an attempt to see what we could make of the equipment. I was happy to see that all the computers and monitors had survived the trip. I was ecstatic to see that all the problems I&#8217;d seen in Toronto had been solved. Blake, one of the wunderkinds of the CBC interactive group, had worked magic that even Gandalf would not challenge.<br />
We worked the whole day, at least when we weren&#8217;t halted by a train or by some other activity that needed our attention. Tests, checks, experiments, and finally decisions. When we were done, there was a feeling of accomplishment (though a few people thought we didn&#8217;t do enough), and of confidence.<br />
Packing everything back up was a bigger challenge. Pulling things out of a baggage car is immeasurably easier than trying to get it back in again. Especially when it needs to be in a specific order. We finished around 21:30 that evening. We called it a night, retiring to the hotel for a rest. The day to come was going to be our real test.<br />
Brenda had arrived in the hotel by that time. She had come out to see how her labours were paying off. Brenda had lost countless days of sleep, and probably gained a few grey hairs working out the details for her department. Now it was time to see if it was all worth it.<br />
Running into Neil in the hotel lobby, he invited me to join him, Brenda, and several others at the bar next door for a quick drink. Brenda and I ended up talking shop the entire time. I told her what I knew. She asked more questions. But in the end, the truth wouldn&#8217;t be known until the next day.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>T-Minus 7 days<br />
Five-thirty is an unfair time of the morning. Especially if your alarm clock wakes you in the middle of a really good dream.<br />
This morning, I took a taxi to the BC Rail station and boarded the Cariboo Prospector. It&#8217;s a three-car Rail Diesel Car (RDC) passenger train that runs between Prince George and North Vancouver.<br />
(An RDC, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a self-propelled passenger car. They were developed in the 50s by the Budd Car Company as a means for simple passenger operation without the need for an extra locomotive. For a while, RDCs were a common site in North America. Now they are a dying breed. In Canada, only BC Rail and VIA still run RDCs, and only in three places: Victoria-Courteney on Vancouver Island (VIA), Sudbury-White River in Ontario (VIA), and Prince George-North Vancouver.)<br />
This will be an important trip for me. Due to budget cuts at BC Rail, the Prospector will cease operations at the end of October. This is also true for BC Rail&#8217;s other services, the Pacific Starlight and the Whistler Northwind. The Royal Hudson service already met with an ignominious end when both 2860 and 3716 steam locomotives required maintenance. Their end came in 1999. (2860 is now on display at the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish. 3716 is stored unserviceable at BC Rail.)<br />
It is truly a shame that a service such as this would befall such a fate. While perhaps not the speediest form of transportation, it is very comfortable, and you simply can&#8217;t see this country any other way. And that&#8217;s not to count the necessity. There&#8217;s a native tribe just south of Lillooet that needs the service to get from Lillooet to their home. With the service ending, they needed to contract a shuttle with BC Rail.<br />
It&#8217;s a 15 hour trip from Prince George to North Vancouver. It&#8217;s not only a trip through some of the most beautiful country in Canada, but it&#8217;s also a test of endurance. If you can&#8217;t survive 15 hours on one day, how would you survive 33 days?<br />
This was one day I was happy to endure. The weather wasn&#8217;t the most ideal, admittedly. That didn&#8217;t take away from the majesty of our natural ecosystems or of the sculpted terrain. Though the cloudy skies did bring an early night.<br />
The trip is run as a partial tourist train. It was initially started to serve the countless little communities between the Lower Mainland and Prince George (most of them remnants from the Gold Rush). Either through evolution or through need, it soon became a partial tourist train. As the train rolls along, one of the train crew points out sights and tells some of the local history. The fact that you&#8217;re fed breakfast, lunch, and dinner as you ride is an added bonus.<br />
The only real down side of the trip is that you&#8217;re confined to your car for the duration of the journey. You aren&#8217;t allowed between cars, and most of the stops are too brief to let people off. Between Lillooet and North Vancouver, there was only one stop of sufficient length for people to stretch their legs.<br />
By the time we reached Whistler, it was darkening fast. Not far past the resort, you could barely make out silhouettes, let alone the colours or objects. The remainder of the ride to North Vancouver was quiet and uneventful. Once we entered sight of the Lions Gate Bridge, however, the lights of the night city were spectacular.<br />
My friend Joel and his wife Michelle greeted me at the station. They had offered me refuge for a few days before I started with the CBC. Though they lived nearly an hour out of downtown, the need for rest and quiet were more than appealing enough. Fifteen hours of travel isn&#8217;t physically tiring, but it is draining.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my second day here at the CBC head office in Toronto. This is a weird place.<br />
You&#8217;re probably asking: What is Geoff doing at the CBC head office in Toronto? That&#8217;s a question I can&#8217;t answer just yet &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to wait until next Tuesday. (The irony is that this won&#8217;t be posted until after I can say what I&#8217;m doing at the CBC. So I could tell you why I&#8217;m here. But hey, it&#8217;s all about telling a story.)<br />
I came in yesterday, taking the GO Train from Clarkson, in the very west of Mississauga. The trip out was quite pleasant (the joys of express trains), and relaxing &#8230; so I thought. The train arrived smoothly and without urgency. I was expecting a leisurely walk to the CBC building (I was a half hour early). Wrong expectation.<br />
As soon as the doors opened, I was overwhelmed with a panic, similar to that of stampeding animals. I felt the urge to move very quickly, and stay with the herd, er, crowd.<br />
Now I remember why I like living in Calgary &#8212; less pressure.<br />
Wandering down Front Street, I quite quickly found myself at the main doors. Not only was I very early, but I was remarking at how HUGE this place is. The building is the size of a city block, no question. It&#8217;s 10 stories tall, not counting the basements. It&#8217;s so big it has at least four sets of elevators &#8212; probably six or more. They&#8217;re colour-coded so you can find them easily.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you can find anything in this building. King Minos&#8217; labyrinth wasn&#8217;t this confusing. (Nor was the 6th floor of the Math and Computer building at the University of Waterloo, despite its near-legendary lack of structure.)<br />
It&#8217;s a bit of a surreal experience. It&#8217;s a true media outlet. (The only thing the CBC doesn&#8217;t touch is print &#8212; but give them the chance, and I&#8217;d bet they would.) You&#8217;d almost expect to run into one of a large number of semi-famous people (I reserve &#8220;famous&#8221; for those instantly recognizable) roaming the halls.<br />
I have yet to see Peter Mansbridge, though.<br />
It took me most of yesterday to get the gist of how this place works. Luckily for me, Brenda returned this morning to really get things moving. While I have a vague idea of what I need to do, Brenda had a lot of the details I didn&#8217;t.<br />
The building offers some interesting services, aside from the media aspects, of course. There&#8217;s the Glenn Gould Studio, a concert hall cum recording studio; robotic mail delivery; an in-house credit union (almost every employee here is unionized); a very in-depth intranet; a beautiful atrium (big bucks in construction, no doubt) that includes a sushi bar; a museum (or three); and probably a lot of stuff I just haven&#8217;t found yet.<br />
And I&#8217;ve only been here two days. I&#8217;ll be here for a couple of days more, though. Then it&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s wedding, and back home.<br />
Three weeks later, I&#8217;m off on another adventure of a lifetime.<br />
Which I can&#8217;t tell you about.<br />
Yet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been about nine months since I last saw 6060, when I left Jasper for Calgary. That&#8217;s about eight months too long, I figure.<br />
Mind you, many haven&#8217;t seen 6060 since early November, since we&#8217;ve all been off living our lives while she sat in a shed for the winter. And as we had little money for maintenance work, little was done over the winter. In fact, almost nothing&#8217;s been done this spring or summer, either. It&#8217;s very handy when you pass all of your inspections.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be problems. Arriving just after 9:00, I found a large portion of the team staring at the air compressor. Apparently, on it&#8217;s first run of the year (the day before), the compressor had lost its lubricant. Something wasn&#8217;t working.<br />
What exactly was broken, I&#8217;m not sure. But it took seven people to get it back together again. (There&#8217;s a joke about trainmen and a lightbulb in there somewhere.) The air compressor is a vastly complicated piece of machinery &#8212; something I fear I&#8217;ll one day have to pull apart to repair. But I got my first taste, so hopefully next time it won&#8217;t be so bad.<br />
Just so long as my memory of what we did doesn&#8217;t get displaced by some other seemingly random piece of useless trivia.<br />
But just after noon, we declared 6060 fully operational (without the air compressor, we would have gone nowhere), and were ready to do the run to Big Valley. 6060 will do only seven runs this year. It&#8217;s a small number, but it&#8217;s far better than just sitting around. Luckily, this was one run I got to follow.<br />
The Stettler to Big Valley run is quite short &#8212; only about 30 kilometres. Mind you, it takes over an hour to run it, because 6060 can&#8217;t run quickly on the line with passengers. That makes it very easy to pass for taking pictures. Which is precisely what Graham and I did that Saturday afternoon.<br />
Interestingly enough, I first met Graham chasing 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It didn&#8217;t take long for us to become friends, having a mutual love for trains (although I lean more to steam; Graham&#8217;s partial to anything on rails). It also didn&#8217;t take long to convince Graham to join the Rocky Mountain Rail Society.<br />
This was Graham&#8217;s first meeting with the RMRS, although he nearly missed 6060&#8217;s 14:30 departure from Stettler. We hooked up about a half-kilometre down the line from the station. And we started taking pictures.<br />
Graham had never been to Stettler before, and had never been down any of the side roads in the Stettler / Big Valley area. They&#8217;re a little hairy. Especially when you&#8217;re trying to outrun a train. (Even if it slow-moving.)<br />
Our first pictures were at a station-like landing just down from the station itself. Then we raced to the crossing just as you exited Stettler heading south on Hwy. 56. After that, we headed down to the road crossing at Warden. Followed by Warden South. And then at multiple crossings and hills overlooking the rails all the way down.<br />
The road we were on didn&#8217;t follow the tracks perfect, so we&#8217;d regularly lose sight of the rails. This was a problem because sometimes, the tracks would suddenly reappear, and you had to quickly judge whether it was worth stopping, or continuing down. And the suddenness was the problem &#8212; if you slammed on your brakes on the loose gravel road, you&#8217;d fishtail quite easily.<br />
I did a few times. (Although I had a rally car-like turn at one corner, trying to avoid a dog I saw, and turning onto a road about 10 seconds ahead of 6060. After I realized I wasn&#8217;t going to die, I was quite pleased with myself.)<br />
Taking pictures where we could, we weaved our way down to Big Valley, arriving in time to catch the train being held up by bandits (part of the show), and meeting the train in Big Valley itself. It was a little harried, but I introduced Graham to Don, Harry, Terry, and anyone else from the RMRS I could find.<br />
But then it was off for us, back to Calgary. (Separate ways, that is.) As much as I wanted to follow 6060 back to Stettler, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t last long enough. I was pretty tired and wanted to go home and rest. I&#8217;ll do the full run next time.<br />
Though not quite as fast, I think.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This was, to say the least, one of the busier weekends I&#8217;ve had in a long time. It was a very good weekend in many respects, not the least of which was actually (finally) getting my house. But it all kinda started this way&#8230;<br />
Saturday morning, 9:30am. After staying up a little late to do more packing (with a lot left still to do), I arose a little tired, but excited to tackle the day. I had three basic things to do: Attend the Rocky Mountain Rail Society&#8217;s Annual General Meeting in the south end of Calgary, take possession of my house, and finish packing. Looks fairly simple, right?<br />
But simple can be deceiving&#8230;<br />
I arrived about two minutes before the AGM was to start. Not a huge deal &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the only straggler, and we didn&#8217;t actually get going until about 11:10am that morning anyway. That gave me time to set up the laptop with images of trains and steam locomotives that I&#8217;ve been taking for the last year. (I&#8217;ve got quite a few of them now.)<br />
I&#8217;ve never been to an annual meeting of any kind, and this was pretty much an eye-opener for me. Despite the fact that, amongst ourselves, the RMRS is pretty lax. We don&#8217;t have any hierarchy, we all joke/make fun of each other, bend rules to get things done, and avoid formality almost as if it were a disease. Until the AGM on Saturday morning, there was only one case I knew of where things were followed to the letter: Actually running 6060, at which point the half century of railroading rules and regulations take over, and are followed to the punctuation mark. The AGM was the second time.<br />
The first thing I noticed was that certain people (the Treasurer, the Membership Officer, the Secretary, and some of the Directors) wore name plates. The meeting was ordered, directed by the Chairman (who was elected at the end of the meeting to President, our last president having fulfilled his term and stepped down), recorded by the Secretary, and everyone coordinating it by referral of title (e.g. &#8220;Mr. Chairman&#8221;), even by the founders and most senior members.<br />
The meeting closed at 12:45pm, just in time for a catered lunch. This was great for me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t have a lot of food in the apartment, and I figured it would be a while before I&#8217;d be eating again (I had a lot of packing to do, and didn&#8217;t want to get too distracted).<br />
The meeting having more or less wrapped up by 2:00pm, I hopped in my car and drove out to Sunnyside to meet up with Robyn, my realtor. When I arrived at 2:30pm, she was already there. We took quick looks around the house, seeing what was in order, and what wasn&#8217;t.<br />
The main floor was in good condition. The floors were a little scratched (but to be expected with hardwood &#8230; I need to refinish them in a year or two anyway), and the walls had been repainted (or touched up) where items had removed from the walls. In the kitchen, there were three things slightly amiss.<br />
First, the hot water connection under the sink was still leaking (we identified this during the home inspection, and the previous owner was to have fixed it), there were still dishes in one of the cupboards (not sure if they&#8217;re forgotten or discarded), and there was a partially-assembled barbecue in the middle of the floor.<br />
Yes, a barbecue. Robyn had said from relatively early in our home purchasing relationship that she&#8217;d do this, because I&#8217;d directed a couple of people her way. I&#8217;d always kind of resisted this generosity, mostly because I didn&#8217;t think I deserved it. But there it was &#8230; in it&#8217;s partially-assembled glory (Robyn hadn&#8217;t finished putting it together yet).<br />
I said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again: I&#8217;ve got the best realtor in town.<br />
We quickly toured the basement. A couple of boxes, but otherwise empty and no different than the last time I&#8217;d seen it. Nearly whacked my head again on the air ducts. (If I&#8217;m in there long enough, one of the things I&#8217;m going to do is drop that floor a couple of feet. Darren nearly decapitated himself when taking things down there on Sunday.)<br />
The upstairs had a couple of problems. The first was a series of stains in the north bedroom which I couldn&#8217;t remember having seen before, nor did Robyn, and we know it wasn&#8217;t mentioned during the home inspection, so we wonder if the inspector saw them. (Mind you, the previous owner did have screens and furniture there, so it&#8217;s possible she hid them from sight.)<br />
But the stains weren&#8217;t the worst part. As I looked just past the stains to the wall, I noticed a rather odd thing that ran right around the base of the walls. The baseboards. Or more specifically, the lack thereof.<br />
The previous owner had taken them. To paraphrase Tom Arnold in &#8220;True Lies&#8221;, what kind of sick freak takes the baseboards?!<br />
That one had Robyn and I completely stumped. I had to laugh. I mean, they&#8217;re baseboards: Cheap strips of painted wood. I&#8217;m actually amazed she managed to get them off without damaging the walls. But now I have to replace them, and I don&#8217;t really have the equipment at the moment. And that&#8217;s in addition to all the other things I have to do around the house.<br />
We adjourned outside to quickly inspect the exterior. I might need to paint this year, too. I&#8217;ll need to double check, but it should hopefully be not too bad. (Luckily, I don&#8217;t need to strip &#8212; all I need to do is paint over what&#8217;s already there.) The roof needs reshingling (but I knew that before) &#8212; if not this year, definitely next.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the garage. I have a funny feeling the last few tenants haven&#8217;t even bothered with going inside it. The door lock is broken, the walls are rotting, the roof sags and leaks, and the concrete pad is pretty much gone. But it&#8217;s a single car detached garage. A couple months with proper construction should replace it without too much difficulty. For now, I&#8217;ll just keep an eye on it. But sooner or later, I&#8217;ll need to do the actual work.<br />
Lastly, there&#8217;s the yard. The last owner was quite good at maintaining the interior of the house. The yard, however, was not her forte. Many parts are weeded over, saplings everywhere, and brown spots on some parts of the yard. It&#8217;s going to take a bit of work to clean all that up. I&#8217;ll leave the interior work until this winter, so I can clean that up now.<br />
But hey, I wanted a bit of a fixer-upper to begin with. So in retrospect, my initial desire still gets fulfilled &#8212; by the garage, if nothing else.<br />
A half hour after leaving, I was done. I had keys in hand, and was ready to return home and pack. The actual transfer of ownership, though, seemed lacking in something. Technically, all Robyn had to do was put keys in my hand. There was no fanfare, no celebration. Just &#8220;here&#8217;s your keys!&#8221;. Mind you, Robyn was pretty happy about it. But after five months of waiting, it was anti-climactic. It was almost, I shudder to say, empty.<br />
I returned to the apartment to resume packing and prepare for the move. But there was one thing I wanted to do first: Move Miao-Yin.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are times when I wonder if I&#8217;m slightly psychic. Every time it happens, it gives me the willies. This was one time I sincerely wished I was wrong.<br />
Since long before the trip with 6060, I&#8217;d had this feeling, thought, dream, whatever you want to call it, that one of our engineers was going to die somewhere around Jasper. Most of the engineers are old &#8212; well into their 70s, and after a lifetime of working in coal dust, smoke, soot, and grease, probably not as healthy as they could be. (That said, they certainly look healthy.)<br />
In my foresight, I had believed that Harry would fall ill and die during the trip. In that respect, I was wrong. However, my mortal prediction still came true. On Sunday 28 October, at approximately 10:00 in the morning, Tom Arnott suffered a cardiac arrest while sitting in the crew car. Although there were other crew present, and 911 dialed almost immediately, the arrest was severe. Paramedics worked to save his life, and he was believed to have stabilized at Jasper Hospital some time later. But the damage was too far gone. I didn&#8217;t know at the time (I had to leave for home, and heard the news only 20 minutes ago), Tom never recovered.<br />
Tom was an ex-CN engineer, and had lived in Jasper quite a long time. Harry and Tom had known each other for many years, Harry&#8217;s son Cameron had regularly gone to Tom&#8217;s house to visit. Like Harry, Tom had surrounded himself with the railroad, even after retirement. Tom spent the last few years working with Alberta Prairie Steam Excursions, as one of the lead engineers on #41. Tom was also a secondary on 6060, and had fired the engine from Edson to Hinton on the trip.<br />
Tom was a kind and gentle man, loved by many, disliked by very few. Like other old hoggers, he had many stories of his life on the rails. Now, those stories can only be told by those who had heard them before.<br />
The light in the firebox is out, and the boiler gone cold. Old engineers never die, they just run out of steam.<br />
Farewell, my friend.</p>

1 Great Vacation<br />
What many people everyday call work, I call relaxation.<br />
While I would love to sit here and type out every single little excrutiating detail, I&#8217;m going to spare you the agony and cover only the highlights.<br />
1) Vancouver<br />
I went to Vancouver on 18 October for, of all things, a party. Radical held it&#8217;s 10th Anniversary celebrating its success over the years. As a former employee, I was invited along to partake in the festivities.<br />
In addition to seeing friends I hadn&#8217;t seen in a few years, and making a few new acquaintances, I tried to remember why I&#8217;d left Radical two years ago. I still haven&#8217;t been able to give myself a suitable answer.<br />
2) The Great Train Trip<br />
Returning to Calgary on the Friday (19 October) &#8212; I flew &#8212; I proceeded to pack and prepare for Phase II of my vacation: Helping run 6060 on its biggest excursion in years. We were going to run it all the way to Jasper.<br />
This has been Harry&#8217;s dream for many years, taking 6060 back to his home town in celebration &#8212; and bring it in under it&#8217;s own power. This was something we&#8217;d been preparing for most of the summer, and we (there were up to 16 of us helping to run the train) were anxious.<br />
It started with a quick run to Stettler from Warden. There we found our mechanical glitch for the trip, which was quickly fixed. Then on to Red Deer, where we turned around and headed north to Edmonton. A stopover to pick up rail cars, we were off to Edson, Hinton, and ultimately, Jasper.<br />
I drove the entire way, chasing the train, taking pictures and shooting video footage. It was a wild ride, and my poor car had to endure the worst punishment any K-car should ever be subjected to.<br />
I&#8217;m going to bronze that car when it finally dies.<br />
The trip ended, for me anyway, in Jasper. Although there&#8217;s still the return leg and the winterizing of 6060, I&#8217;ll be trapped here in the office. The season is now officially over. Work won&#8217;t start again until January, which is fine with me. It&#8217;ll take that long to edit the movie.<br />
Why the shortness of detail? Simply put, I&#8217;m writing this one out in detail, and it&#8217;s going to take a while. When it&#8217;s up, you&#8217;ll know&#8230;</p>

		<p>Most of you know how hard it is sometimes to catch a train. Sometimes you&#8217;re running late, or the train&#8217;s early, or your watch stopped and you&#8217;re not really sure what time it is &#8212; any number of a dozen reasons why you&#8217;d be running your heart out trying to get there before you hear: &#8220;Stand clear of the doors, please.&#8221;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have a new girlfriend.<br />
She&#8217;s a little temperamental, though. She gets hot really fast, she&#8217;s always blowing steam, and at the moment has a nasty tendency to run around mostly naked.<br />
That, and she weighs 637,540 pounds.<br />
Yes, I too have succumbed to the wiles of the Iron Mistress. I suppose it was only a matter of time. Hanging around the 6060 work crew probably doesn&#8217;t help matters, either.<br />
Saturday was yet another trip for me out to the middle of Nowhere, Alberta (also known as Stettler). You&#8217;d think that with only a few measly hours of sleep that I&#8217;d have an awfully hard time trying to pull my butt out of bed early Saturday morning.<br />
You&#8217;d think.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing sometimes what willpower can do. That and a good bout of adrenaline. I was in a hurry. I had to be in Stettler by around 9am, and I was already 30 minutes late (I&#8217;d slept through my first alarm).<br />
The trip up was nothing out of the ordinary. Drive Highway 2 to south Red Deer, fill tank with gas, take route 595 east to Highway 11, and then to Highway 12, which takes me right into Stettler, and right to the Stettler train station. I&#8217;ve done that route a couple times &#8212; it&#8217;s quite nice &#8212; and aside from a bit of traffic (road construction) it went pretty quick.<br />
On 20 July, CN 6060 was supposed to do a run from Stettler to Big Valley (and back). Although it had been ready to do the run, the safety coordinator for the rail line had forbid 6060 from running on the line &#8212; the ballast (what holds the tracks in place and defines the rail bed) was too light in some places.<br />
So when I arrived at the station, all I found was #41 &#8212; Alberta Prairie&#8217;s 1920 Baldwin Consolidation 2-8-0. It&#8217;s a small steam engine &#8212; a scant 62 feet long (6060 is one and a half times longer) and a piddily 244,000 pounds (6060 is over two and a half times heavier). It&#8217;s a nice little engine than can, but it&#8217;s not the one I was looking for. I found 6060 still in Warden, having been denied the run.<br />
On Saturday morning, I was not disappointed. As I drove along (having to take a detour due to road construction), I caught a glimpse of a now very-familiar huge black and green locomotive sitting next to the Stettler station. Already, Harry, Ernie, and Don were hard at work.<br />
This was the second day in a row that 6060 would run, having run also on the Friday. Like most days 6060 runs, the train had been packed &#8212; over 400 passengers. The anticipation of a large crowd was high. So there was extra pressure to make the train look (and run) as well as possible.<br />
Donning my now very grubby jeans, I leapt at the chance to do whatever I could. So I got handed the jobs of helping Don grease the tender&#8217;s bearings (managing to get quite a bit of grease on myself in the process), and wiping down all the trucks (the non-powered wheels) and the drivers (powered wheels) on the engine. My hands were literally soaking in Varsol for about two hours. Ouch.<br />
Barely a half hour after I arrived, it was time to get 6060 fired up. Because the insulation and jacket are still not back on (barely the first quarter of the boiler is covered), it cools off very quickly &#8212; there was barely one pound of pressure in the boiler that morning (6060 operates at 250 pounds of pressure).<br />
I&#8217;d always wondered how you start a steam engine. It&#8217;s not like starting a car &#8212; there&#8217;s no key, there&#8217;s no electricity, and there&#8217;s no motor. In fact, starting a steam engine cold is quite a challenge, and not easily done.<br />
The primary problem is draft. Like all fires, you need a draft to keep the fire burning. The problem with steam engines, particularly ones as long as 6060, is getting the draft started. For that, you need an air compressor. A big one.<br />
The air compressor does two things: It charges the blower air tank, and it&#8217;s used to create the draft in the stack. The blower atomizes the Bunker C crude oil we use for fuel, spraying it into the firebox. This allows the oil to burn more cleanly, efficiently, and creates far more heat than just pouring it in. At the opposite end of the engine, jets of compressed air shoot up the smoke stack, drawing the burned gases from the firebox, through the heater pipes, and into the stack.<br />
It sound complicated, but it really isn&#8217;t. Provided you have a source of compressed air, anyway. If you don&#8217;t, well, you&#8217;re not going anywhere. You can&#8217;t start 6060 without this handy little feature. So of course, the question is how did they start 6060 when she was operating with CN Rail&#8230;<br />
A boiler. A big freaking boiler. Every roundhouse had a boiler room, whose sole purpose was generating steam for starting up steam engines. That&#8217;s all it did. If your engine ran out of water in the middle of nowhere, you were screwed. Even if you could refill your water, by the time you got it your engine was cold. After that, you had to be towed back to a roundhouse to be restarted. And you got in trouble.<br />
Heating something the size of 6060 would take hours, or so I thought. But you&#8217;d be surprised how quickly something the size of 6060 can get hot. I noticed this the hard way, when Mitch (who showed up for a while to help fix a split steam line) called me out to the engineer&#8217;s side running board to help splice a line back together. Next to what little insulation we had on, the engine seemed cool. But once I&#8217;d passed the jacket, it felt like I was standing next to an industrial-sized waffle iron.<br />
It didn&#8217;t help that I was on the sunny side of the engine, either.<br />
Within two hours, steam started to trickle out of some of the various vents, ports, and exhausts. At first, it was just drops of hot water. But soon, little clouds were blowing out. The previously cold, calm engine was beginning to feel a little more dangerous. Of course, this was when I was rubbing very flammable Varsol all over the wheels right next to many of these steaming vents, under a now very hot boiler. I kept expecting one of the vents to suddenly blast open and peel my skin off.<br />
But Harry and Ernie were well aware of where I was at all times. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re engineers. They don&#8217;t open anything until they&#8217;re sure no-one&#8217;s around.<br />
By 12:00, 6060 was approaching operating pressure. Passengers for the 14:30 trip were already arriving, mostly just to watch 6060 go through its paces. While Harry, Ernie, Tom (Alberta Prairie Rail Excursion&#8217;s engineer, who was on a &#8220;training&#8221; run &#8212; no pun intended) worked in the cab, Don and I finished off work on the outside.<br />
My hands tingling from the Varsol, but otherwise done my tasks, I joined the engineers in the cab to hopefully absorb a few things about running a steam locomotive. I listened to what Harry and Tom discussed, periodically asking Ernie for explanations on things I didn&#8217;t understand. Don was learning as well &#8212; he&#8217;s a few steps ahead of the game compared to me, but he&#8217;s also been with the RMRS for 15 years.<br />
One of the most fascinating things was watching the fire in the firebox. Only a month earlier, I had stood inside it, wondering what it would be like when lit up. Now I could barely see the features, they were obscured by the orangey-red flames that swirled around. The heat was intense, but nothing 6060 wasn&#8217;t used to.<br />
By 13:00, we were ready to start the engine in motion. Grabbing my camera, I took up position and waited. For a while, nothing happened. But then 6060&#8217;s forward bell started to ring, warning all around that a very hot 313 metric-tonne hunk of iron was about to start moving. A sudden (and very loud) blast of steam shot out from the cylinder cocks, and slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, the huge engine started to move forward.<br />
I felt a tingle in the back of my next. 21 years rushed by like a summer breeze. For a split moment, I was eight again, hiding behind my father as this giant black beast came tearing down the rails in Oakville. I remembered that it had scared me, but also deeply intrigued me. It was good to feel so young again. Now I know why those who work on 6060 are always smiling, and are so young at heart.<br />
In front of 6060 was the caboose, and most of the day&#8217;s train. The rest was waiting down the yard &#8212; the train had been &#8220;broken&#8221; the night before, because a road bisects the rail yard. The train rolled down and softly linked up with the remaining cars. The linesmen hooked up the steam and brake lines, and a few minutes later, the entire train started back to switch onto the main line.<br />
The Stettler station sits on a portion of barely-used track owned by the East Central Heritage Society. It used to be a CN short line, until the Government allowed CN (and CP) to start giving up their unprofitable lines. Now Alberta Prairie Rail Excursions is the primary user of the line. So we didn&#8217;t have to worry about tying anyone else up.<br />
Because there aren&#8217;t any turntables or switch arounds, 6060 had to run in reverse for the trip down to Big Valley. For a steam train, it&#8217;s a little awkward, but almost no different than running forward. Besides, at the speeds we would be running, it was hardly an issue.<br />
Finished my current round of picture taking, I returned to the cab, to see what was going on. Harry spotted me and called me up for an impromptu &#8220;meeting&#8221;. Being the youngest, I was the designated gopher. My job was to go for ice creams &#8212; Harry was buying. Being a hot day, it also meant I had to run.<br />
There are times I don&#8217;t like the dryness of Alberta. But when you can run in jeans in 32 degree weather and know that your sweat will just evaporate, you really can&#8217;t complain too much.<br />
Soon, it was 10 minutes until departure. Although we weren&#8217;t with a real rail line, everyone was running like they were &#8212; the conductors, Harry and Ernie, even Don read off in railroad time (military time) and were synchronizing watches. Old habits die hard, I guess. With 10 minutes remaining, it was time to sound the whistle. It should have brought back so many memories of watching 6060 roar past when I was a child.<br />
Unfortunately, I was standing next to the whistle at the time, so it only succeeded in scaring the hell out of me.<br />
It&#8217;s a powerful whistle too &#8212; none of these pipsqueak little tin whistles. This is fed by 250 pounds of steam. It&#8217;s loud. Loud enough to shake you to your bones. (Don wears ear plugs when riding 6060 because the whistle&#8217;s so loud.) You can hear it for miles. Out in the open prairie, it&#8217;s a beautiful sound. Standing right next to it &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say my ears rang for a little while.<br />
At 14:30 on the nose, Harry sounded the high ball (three short blasts of the whistle) to indicate that we were off. Don and I took position in the caboose&#8217;s cupola, right behind 6060. We faced the front of the engine the whole trip down. It was wonderful to see it running again.<br />
It was so good, in fact, that I felt an urge to share the experience with the man who got me hooked on all this in the first place &#8212; my father. Through the miracles of modern technology, I called up my parents and let him listen to the chugging of the engine and the blast of the whistle.<br />
Just as we started to pull into Big Valley, the train lurched to a stop. We were nowhere near the station, but our forward progress had been retarded &#8230; by train robbers.<br />
Yes, train robbers.<br />
This is part of the whole act. The robbers come, stir up trouble, get some money, and are promptly stopped by the local sheriff. It&#8217;s a prairie thing. Of course, the sheriff, late to arrive, has no clue who lost money to the thieves, so in a kind-hearted gesture, donates the loot to children&#8217;s charities.<br />
Robbery completed, we finished the last 500 metres into Big Valley. While passengers disembarked and headed up to the hall for dinner (part of the price of admission), 6060 switched ends of the train so it could make the run back later. After she was hooked back up, Harry and Ernie did a quick inspection, and shut her down for a couple of hours, so we could go eat.<br />
You never leave a running steam engine unattended.<br />
Dinner is part of the package. It&#8217;s quite good, too, prepared by local Big Valley folks in their town hall. It&#8217;s typical fare &#8212; mashed potatoes, vegetables, roast beef (albeit a little overdone), and even has pork cutlets and shrimp. My sweat equity bought me a free trip on the train and a free dinner. Can&#8217;t argue with that.<br />
Harry, Ernie, and the two conductors (Ed and Warren) told war stories of their days on the rails. One day, I&#8217;d love to write a book about some of these &#8212; most are unbelievable (Harry can actually say he drove a locomotive through a house), the rest stop at merely hilarious. Makes me wish sometimes I was 50 years older, and an ex-railwayman.<br />
Following our dinner, we returned to get 6060 back in gear again. During the hour we were gone, she&#8217;d lost almost 60 pounds of pressure (another reason why we need to get the insulation and jacket back on &#8212; so that won&#8217;t happen), so firing her up was of big importance. A large number of people came out to look at the engine while this was going on. Don ran interference for Harry and Ernie, answering questions about 6060 and her history.<br />
Soon, 19:00 rolled around, and we started back for Stettler. This time, Don and I were at the end of the train. It was much quieter (no hulking locomotive to rattle the windows), and we could clearly hear the clickety-clack of the wheels and the barking of the engine.<br />
Yes, &#8220;barking&#8221;. This is another term I&#8217;ve learned. When a steam locomotive starts up a grade, or is hauling a lot of weight, it will chug loudly and distinctly &#8212; this is called &#8220;barking&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure where that term comes from. I have to remember to ask. (I did ask what &#8220;hogheads&#8221; were and what that etymology was.)<br />
We arrived back in Stettler around 20:30. I was exhausted, and I hadn&#8217;t really done much. There was still work to do &#8212; 6060 had to switch cars once they were emptied, the train broken, and then 6060 had to go back to Warden so we can continue working on her.<br />
But I had to get home. I had plans for Sunday, and being in Warden, unfortunately, wasn&#8217;t part of them.<br />
So for the first time in 21 years, I saw 6060 in action right in front of me. Not as impressive, unfortunately, as when I had seen her run through the Oakville sub as a child, but no less awe-inspiring.<br />
I left the Spirit of Alberta behind, but only for a few days. I&#8217;ll be back on the weekend. There&#8217;s still a lot of work to do, and a lot for me to learn. We&#8217;ll be running again on 21 September, with the jacket back in place, and hopefully with a fresh coat of paint.<br />
Hope you can all make it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I knew something was up a few months ago, when Chris told me he was going to Ontario for &#8220;a friend&#8217;s wedding&#8221;. Chris is rarely that vague. More often than not, he&#8217;ll include a name, even if it&#8217;s someone I don&#8217;t know.<br />
A month or two later, I got the call. It was Gerry, phoning long distance from Bermuda, with &#8220;big&#8221; news. Seeing as Sam (Gerry&#8217;s girlfriend) had given birth to their son Alex on March 2nd, it was doubtful the news was &#8220;Sam&#8217;s pregnant&#8221;. This was something different &#8230; they were getting married.<br />
The early secrecy was because Gerry wasn&#8217;t sure of who was going to be invited, and who wasn&#8217;t. Not wanting to hurt feelings, no-one was originally to know, unless they&#8217;d been invited. Chris and Gerry have been close friends for years (having once shared an apartment for a year), which is why he was invited early on.<br />
Chris and I were to fly out to Ottawa for the wedding. Stuart and Therese were also invited, but were conveniently already in Ontario due to another wedding. Chris was then invited to a second wedding (although it would come before Gerry&#8217;s) &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s brother Andre, who was getting married the day before.<br />
Confused? Good, most people were. (Originally, the primary wedding was Andre&#8217;s. Gerry and Sam were holding a &#8220;christening&#8221; the following day for their son. Little did most people know that the christening would be closely followed by a wedding.)<br />
Chris caught the red eye from Calgary on the 13th, arriving early Saturday morning in Ottawa. I would follow seven hours later &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel the need to get to Ottawa so quickly. My flight was mostly uneventful, seated next to a young couple and their eight month old son. We chatted on and off throughout the flight. The meal was unremarkable, though not terrible. The movie was &#8220;Josie and the Pussycats&#8221;; although I would have normally watched it, it&#8217;s not the sort of movie I want to watch at that hour of the morning.<br />
Pearson was a little quieter than the previous few times I&#8217;d flown through it, though being the middle of July probably was a contributing factor. I was to switch to a Rapidair flight to Ottawa, although someone had neglected to give me a gate at which to find my flight. Luckily, I figured out that if you followed the signs that read &#8220;Ottawa / Montreal&#8221;, they led to where I had to go.<br />
The Ottawa flight was equally uneventful. At barely an hour, it was just long enough for the flight attendants to quickly hand out &#8220;snacks&#8221; (which was a half turkey and Swiss cheese sandwich on focaccia, a cup of some strange (albeit very tasty) pasta salad, and a pair of cookies). I found it ironic that the &#8220;snack&#8221; was far better than the breakfast.<br />
Arriving in Ottawa, I found myself searching for familiar landmarks. It had been five and a half years since I&#8217;d last been to our nation&#8217;s capital, and I was anxious to see how much it had changed. The only landmark I could see under the partly cloudy skies was the NSC&#8217;s wind tunnel.<br />
Whipping through the terminal, I soon found myself in the baggage claim area, looking for my friend Rebecca. However, we managed to miss each other in the tremendous sea of people that had formed around the door. It took us nearly ten minutes to meet up, but only when I spotted a young woman who looked vaguely familiar.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d seen Rebecca had been 3 May 1996, the day that she, Stefan, Dhar, and I had returned from a break-neck tour of the United States. (Stefan and Dhar I saw a couple months later when they were passing through Oakville.) She looked only a little older (most likely due to the students she had been teaching) and her hair was much shorter with a few blonde streaks, but she looked otherwise the same.<br />
We quickly exited the terminal and headed for her car. After calling Stefan to let him know we were headed back to their home, we resumed our &#8220;how are you doing?&#8221; conversation. It was a little awkward at first. The one thing I&#8217;ve found is that when you communicate with someone through email over an extended period of time, face-to-face conversation is always a little troublesome, much like a beginner with a manual transmission.<br />
Rebecca drove us deep into the heart of Ottawa. Once upon a time, it had been much closer to the south of Ottawa. But in the last five-odd years, Ottawa&#8217;s population has exploded, and houses were in places where I only remembered farmland and forest. It was, to say the least, odd.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca are in the midst of a massive renovation (one that will be ongoing for some time). After we got resettled, Rebecca gave me the grand tour of the their home. It&#8217;s a &#8217;50s tract home built for the returning soldiers of WWII. Like most of the homes in the area, it&#8217;s undergoing a few changes. (Though none quite so drastic as the tear-down/rebuilds a couple blocks away.) When complete, I&#8217;m sure their home will be a showpiece in the area.<br />
The conversation eased up, and soon we were bantering like we&#8217;d only seen each other a month ago. As we talked, I found pictures of their children, Eric and Thea. I hadn&#8217;t seen either of them in years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen Thea since she was about six months old. Eric was only about six at the time.<br />
When Eric entered the house (at his mother&#8217;s request), he didn&#8217;t recognize me. I didn&#8217;t think he would. But after a moment, when he was told that I&#8217;d since shaven and cut my hair, there was a sudden &#8220;oh yeah!&#8221; as the light came on. Then he said &#8220;hello&#8221; and ran back out the door.<br />
*Sigh* To be (much) younger again&#8230;<br />
Stefan arrived home shortly thereafter, having spent the morning in a business meeting. It looked for a moment like Stefan and Rebecca had swapped hair &#8212; his was now much longer and (seemingly) more brown than I remembered.<br />
Conversation veered more into the technical from there, as Stefan and I caught up. This gave Rebecca a chance to start on dinner. (We had been rather indecisive with what we were going to do about dinner, so we ended up staying in.)<br />
Dinner at Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s is &#8230; interesting. The food is delectable, and the entertainment is well worth the price of admission. Eric is a natural comedian. Even though he&#8217;s not even a teenager yet, he&#8217;s well on his way to driving his parents nuts &#8230; add two spectators (Rebecca&#8217;s friend Marnie and yours truly), and the comedy just keeps rolling (especially since Marnie eggs Eric on, inadvertently or otherwise). Even Thea gets into it &#8212; most likely through influence from her brother.<br />
Following dinner, we adults decided to make a run for the bars, so we could ditch the kids for a while. Thea went to a sleepover at a friends, and Eric guarded the house. This left the four of us to find some corner of Ottawa to curl up into. But first, I was awarded a quick tour of the new and improved Ottawa.<br />
Since I last lived in Ottawa (summer 1994), much has changed. More companies have moved in, most notably JDS, a very large fibre optic company that seems to be edging out Nortel as the largest company in the area. The main facility they have there is immense, and it&#8217;s only one of several buildings JDS has in the Ottawa area.<br />
And then there are the houses. Endless tracts of houses. In places where you used to have to drive for long period of time before hitting a landmark, there are houses. Lots of houses. I don&#8217;t know what Ottawa&#8217;s population is up to now, but it was just shy of a million (Ottawa-Hull, to be precise) in 1994 &#8212; it&#8217;s gotta be pushing two million by now.<br />
After driving around for about 45 minutes, we ended up downtown along Elgin Street. I couldn&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;d been on Elgin, although it had been a very long time ago. Many of the stores I had known were gone. New ones had sprung up in their places, some were still vacant.<br />
Finding my hotel, I took a moment to drop off my things, so I could proceed gadget-free for the remainder of the evening. (Admittedly, a bit of a naked feeling, not having something with you for wireless communication or telling time.) Returning to the car, we turned onto MacLeod and drove over to Kent. My last apartment in Ottawa still stands on the corner of MacLeod and Kent. It&#8217;s still ugly, it&#8217;s still scummy, but surprisingly enough, hasn&#8217;t changed a bit since I last saw it.<br />
Much of downtown Ottawa has changed. More condos, less stores. The movie theatres are almost all gone &#8212; only the ones in the World Exchange Centre and Rideau Centre are left. Many familiar sites are gone, replaced with something newer. Even the Parliament Buildings have a fresh sheeting of copper &#8212; the distinctive green colour won&#8217;t be back for a decade.<br />
The Market, surprisingly, hasn&#8217;t changed that much. Aside from CHUM/City now occupying space in Market Mall for their radio and TV stations, the Market is almost the same as when I was last there. Some of the bars and restaurants have changed, but the atmosphere is the same, and some bars (most notably the Laff and the Dom) probably haven&#8217;t been cleaned, either.<br />
Parking in the Market, we ended up bar hopping a while, running from the Dom (where we found Dave, one of Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s many friends, and dragged him around with us), to Darcy McGee&#8217;s, to the Heart and Crown before running out of steam. I couldn&#8217;t help but remark at how much I missed being in Ottawa in the summer. It had been a lot of fun the two summers I was there &#8212; even when I had been trapped in Kanata that first year &#8212; and a part of me wanted to move back there to relive it all again.<br />
But I can&#8217;t dwell in the past.<br />
So it was with a twinge of sadness that I had to bid Stefan and Rebecca farewell when they dropped me off at the hotel later that night. I didn&#8217;t know when exactly I&#8217;d see them again &#8212; it had been over five years since the last time, which I don&#8217;t hope to repeat.<br />
I awoke a little later the following morning than I&#8217;d planned, but not enough to make us late. I showered, shaved, donned my best Hawaiian attire, and Chris and I grabbed a cab for east Nepean, and Gerry&#8217;s wedding.<br />
We arrived a little early to the house Andre rented with a few friends (at least, I assume it was a rental), but not before anyone else. Some strange people I didn&#8217;t recognize were already there. The rest were all busy getting ready for the afternoon. Gerry was one of them.<br />
He was under the crab apple tree at the back of the yard, apparently giving instructions. Being busy, there was only time for a quick &#8220;hello&#8221; before he ran off to finish whatever he was working on. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen Gerry in two and a half years, so I expected a bigger &#8220;hello&#8221;. But considering that this was his day in the limelight, I wasn&#8217;t about to say anything.<br />
Chris and I milled around for a while until others we knew began to show up. First, it was Marek and Brenda (who, along with Gerry and I, are ex-employees of Arkipelago in Toronto, where we all met), followed soon by Stuart and Therese. Before I knew it, Kathryn had arrived, with Dan in tow.<br />
The theme of the day was Hawaii. Why Hawaii? Probably because it&#8217;s an easier fashion to track down than &#8220;Bermudan&#8221;. Aside from black knee-high socks and longish shorts, I&#8217;m not really sure what Bermudan fashion entails. Either way, it meant that no-one had to wear anything truly uncomfortable.<br />
The first order of the afternoon was Alex&#8217; christening. Although born three-and-a-half months earlier, it&#8217;s a little more convenient to bring the baby to the family if the family is concentrated in a small area. Andre&#8217;s wedding happened to provide the perfect set-up for just such an occasion.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen Alex before. This was my first meeting with the young lad, but I suspect it&#8217;ll be a few years before he knows who I am. It was also my first time seeing Gerry with his son, a bit of a creepy thing too, I might add.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s gonna be a great dad. It&#8217;s just that &#8230; well &#8230; he&#8217;s a friend of mine who has a kid. It&#8217;s a little unnerving at times. A scant five years ago, most of my friends were unmarried. Now there are but a small number who aren&#8217;t either married or common-law. Soon, it&#8217;ll be only a small number who don&#8217;t have kids. You never seem to notice how old you are until an old roommate introduces you to their five year-old whom you haven&#8217;t met before.<br />
Gerry and Sam walked out with their son, quite proud to present him to a group of people, most of whom had not seen Alex outside of emailed photographs. He was bundled up in a (small) white gown, and clinging to his father. The ceremony was short &#8212; it was my first christening (not counting my own, which admittedly I don&#8217;t quite recall anymore), so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what was supposed to happen.<br />
The christening over, Sam and Alex disappeared into the house while Gerry mingled. (Gerry mingles well. Perhaps too well.) A moments later, Alex reappeared, dressed in his new Hawaiian shirt. I didn&#8217;t know they even made baby sizes, but I guess that makes sense. Denise cued some music, and to the tune of Hot Chocolate&#8217;s &#8220;You Sexy Thing&#8221;, Sam was led out by her bridesmaid across the deck, down the stairs, and up the aisle, taking a momentary pause to get into the groove of the song.<br />
The wedding itself was simple and sweet. No singing (which was beneficial, &#8216;cuz no-one really wants to hear me sing), no kneeling (which would have made taking pictures of the event a bit tricky), and there was a lot of laughter. Basically, the way a happy event should be&#8230;<br />
Gerry cried. A lot. He&#8217;s been waiting for this for years &#8212; I remember talking with him about it a few months ago, and how much he wanted to marry Sam. I guess it was his dream come true. Can&#8217;t say I blame him for being a bit teary-eyed &#8230; most people were, too.<br />
The wedding over, everyone clapped and cheered and cried, and then watched as Gerry and Sam made everything nice and legal. Almost as soon as the newly wedded (and christened) family was presented, Gerry asked Jamie to come forward for his announcement. Jamie asked Denise (Gerry&#8217;s sister) to come up to the front, where he promptly proposed.<br />
Kleenex would have made a killing.<br />
The mug shots came shortly thereafter, with various members of the now much larger family taking turns with the newlyweds and newly-engaged. I took this opportunity to introduce myself to Sam, whom I never met before. Strangely enough, my parents have &#8212; during a stopover in Bermuda while on a cruise, they met Sam when they called up Gerry. (My father had originally wanted to crash Gerry&#8217;s wedding as a surprise.) Sam seemed somewhat disinterested, but more than likely had no clue who the heck I was anyway. Besides, she probably had to meet several people that day.<br />
People started to break up into groups, where we all sat, chatted, ate, drank, and were merry. Some of us doubly so, since Gerry had made sure that the food included a whopping amount of Montreal smoked meat from Schwartz&#8217;s deli. Many of us revelled in a much-missed taste of great deli meats.<br />
As the afternoon drew into evening, the number of people slowly dwindled. Soon, there were but a few left &#8212; most of the family was now gone, leaving mostly friends. Sam and Gerry took the opportunity to start unwrapping the plethora of gifts they (and Alex) had received. I can only imagine what the crate they pack everything into will look like&#8230;<br />
After helping to clean up, word travelled around that dinner might be in order. A quick survey of the people who actually live in Ottawa (primarily Denise and Jamie) suggested that we go to Mama Grazzi&#8217;s, an Italian restaurant down in the Market. We planned to meet at 8:30, with some of us going a little earlier to obtain seats. There would be 14 of us, and Mama didn&#8217;t take reservations&#8230;<br />
Pulling teeth couldn&#8217;t be that hard. Even with six of us standing at the door of the restaurant, they wouldn&#8217;t even consider starting to move tables around for us. (Once I saw much room they had available, I was a little curious as to their initial unwillingness to help out what would inevitably be a large tip.) After about an hour of cajoling, pestering, extreme patience and a lot of &#8220;thank yous&#8221;, we managed to get enough tables to seat 14.<br />
Mama Grazzi&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the fastest restaurant in Ottawa &#8230; but the food is certainly worth waiting for. It&#8217;s almost enough to make me want to take a longer vacation there the next time I go back. Besides, it gave us a sufficiently long time to sit and chat.<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t have known that it was a wedding party. The only ones still in Hawaiian garb were those of us who came direct &#8212; Stuart, Therese, Kathryn, Dan, Chris, and myself. The rest all went back and changed. Otherwise, we looked like any other large group of people out for a good time.<br />
Dinner having ended, we all broke our separate ways. Therese and Stuart headed back to Therese&#8217;s parents place in Carp. Kathryn and Dan went back to their hotel room. The rest of us walked to the Travelodge where the majority were staying the night. There Chris and I bade farewell to Gerry, Sam, Brenda, and Marek. That pang of departure hit me again &#8212; I hoped it wouldn&#8217;t be another three years before I saw Gerry (and Sam and Alex) again. I also hope that next time I saw Brenda and Marek, it wouldn&#8217;t be at a wedding&#8230;<br />
I woke a little earlier the next morning, wanting to get a quick tour of Ottawa before catching my train. I wandered up O&#8217;Connor, and then over to Elgin before arriving at the War Memorial. I hadn&#8217;t really taken pictures of it before, and my attempts to catch the lighting of it the night before were dismal at best. It shone in the morning sun, the blue sky contrasting nicely on the cream granite.<br />
As I took pictures, I started to hear a strange sound &#8212; a marching band. At first, I thought I was just hearing things. But it kept getting louder. I looked down Elgin, only to see a full-blown regimental marching band coming up the street. At first I couldn&#8217;t figure out why &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t a holiday, it wasn&#8217;t a weekend &#8212; but after a moment, it hit me: The changing of the guard.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t seen the changing of the guard since I was a little kid, and my parents first took my sister and I to Ottawa. At the time, I thought Ottawa really dull. But unless it&#8217;s filled with cartoonish mascots and rollercoasters, I suspect a lot of kids would find Ottawa pretty dull. Heck, I know a lot of adults who find Ottawa really dull&#8230;<br />
As I walked down to see the parade go by, I heard a noise behind me that sounded vaguely like someone falling over. Normally, I would turn around. Normally, I would see if that person needed help. For some stupid reason, I didn&#8217;t at first. A moment later, I did, and saw it was an old man who was having trouble getting up. Suddenly, I felt like there was a giant neon sign above my head that read: &#8220;Here stands a callous, self-centred jerk.&#8221;<br />
The man was okay, he was quickly rescued by his middle-aged son. Didn&#8217;t make me feel any better, though. Made me a lot more aware of things around me for the rest of the day, though.<br />
I ended up racing the parade up to Parliament Hill, where the Changing of the Guard takes place. (For those of you interested, the parade enters Parliament Hill at 10:00am sharp &#8212; the bells in the Peace Tower ring almost right on cue.) Despite it being a Monday, there were people ringed all around the drill area. I stayed and watched as long as I dared, but before long (and before the ceremony was complete), I had to leave.<br />
Chris and I checked out of the hotel at roughly 11:30, right on time for me to catch a taxi to the train station. I was going home &#8212; to Oakville, that is. I was going to visit with my family for a couple of days before going back to Calgary. Normally, I would have taken a plane, and covered the distance in an hour. But I felt like I needed to continue a burgeoning tradition in my life.<br />
For two of the previous three years, I had taken a train trip on my birthday. Last year, I was so busy with work that I didn&#8217;t get to do anything interesting. So when I decided to make a side trip to Oakville on my birthday, I figured I&#8217;d do it with a little more style &#8212; I took the VIA train.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d taken VIA was when my father was living in London, selling Ford tractors and construction equipment. This was in the mid-to-late 70s. All I remember of it was the really bad TV dinner I had in my father&#8217;s apartment (the cold french fries still seem to haunt me after all these years). I don&#8217;t remember much else, except that we&#8217;d taken VIA to get there.<br />
Passenger trains in Canada aren&#8217;t what they used to be. Except in and around Toronto, where the GO Trains run on a tight schedule, you&#8217;d be lucky if your train runs right on time. But generally, if you&#8217;re going to take the train, time isn&#8217;t a big concern for you.<br />
The trip runs diagonally through Ottawa, down through several towns I don&#8217;t know the name of, through Smith Falls (where my family used to travel through on the way to a cottage on Charleston Lake), to Kingston, Gananoque, Belleville, and then into the Toronto area. It&#8217;s about a four-hour trip, provided you don&#8217;t get held up by other trains. Which, of course, we did.<br />
We got into Toronto at 5:20, about 35 minutes after we were scheduled to. After hopping off the train, I hustled into the GO lounge, got a ticket, ran onto a westbound GO Train, and continued my journey. I was in the Toronto city limits for all of about 30 minutes. My father picked me up in Clarkson and took me home.<br />
There are probably a few of you who are wondering why I didn&#8217;t call you. If I was in Toronto, it doesn&#8217;t take much to pick up the phone and call, right? That is true, but I had something else in mind, or more specifically, someone else.<br />
A couple of months ago, my family learned that my father had developed non-small cell lung cancer. A lifetime of smoking had finally done what I&#8217;d been expecting for two decades. Although I had gone home to see my family, my primary thoughts were with my father.<br />
It&#8217;s not easy living 3,000 kilometres away when you learn of something like this, even if you are expecting it. You want to be there. You want to help. You want to be the one who can make everything all right, and make the sickness go away. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to come to terms with, knowing that you&#8217;re isolated, and have to rely on others for information, and hope that everyone else knows that you&#8217;re there, even if your body isn&#8217;t.<br />
Needless to say, the family dynamic has changed a little. Instead of toddling along on our merry little way, we&#8217;re keeping an eye on things. As for dad, well, he&#8217;s in treatment, something I&#8217;m immensely proud of. Some people don&#8217;t go this route &#8212; they prefer to live as they did. But my father&#8217;s not going to take this sitting down &#8212; he&#8217;s going to do what seems to run in my family: be really, really, really stubborn.<br />
I even went with him for one of his treatments at Credit Valley Hospital. I&#8217;d heard it was more like a country club than a hospital. It&#8217;s certainly nicer than most of the hospitals I&#8217;ve been in over the past three years. And the oncology room is comfortable. It could be nicer, that&#8217;s for sure, but over all it&#8217;s not that bad. I have to credit dad for putting up with the needles, too. He&#8217;s been a human pincushion for the past few weeks. I can&#8217;t even stand getting a booster shot.<br />
The funny thing was everyone warning me about what he looked like. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t see any real change. Maybe a little older (stress tends to do that), but otherwise none the worse for wear. He looked every bit as strong as the last time I&#8217;d seen him. And I&#8217;ve never seen him eat as much as he currently does &#8212; he eats more than I do!<br />
I spent three days in Oakville with my family. Aside from close family friends who dropped by, I saw no-one else, and I talked with no-one else. It&#8217;s nothing personal, folks, but I have my priorities, and my family comes first.<br />
Because of everything I&#8217;d heard before I came home, I was a little apprehensive. But upon leaving, I knew that things would be alright. I was able to board my plane, knowing without a doubt that he&#8217;ll be in great shape the next time I see him, in early September (I&#8217;m going to Toronto for another wedding).<br />
So just to let you know, Dad, my thoughts are with you, as always. I don&#8217;t need to tell you to be strong, because you already are. I don&#8217;t need to tell you to have no fear, because you never have. Just keep following your heart and your head, and you&#8217;ll do no wrong.<br />
Some say that everything they know in life they learned in Kindergarten. I learned it from my father.<br />
Thanks, dad.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once upon a time, you couldn&#8217;t go very far out here without running into a railway. Tracks criss-crossed the land like a bad hair weave. If you had to get somewhere, you went by train. There were no highways, except for two ribbons of steel. Wherever the steel went, towns sprang up. The building of the CPR and CNR gave way to cities like Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver. For over half a century, the railroads were king.<br />
Today, the lines are mostly abandoned. The main lines still run, but the short tracks are mostly gone. The plethora of grain elevators throughout the west have given way to grasslands, the old railroad beds weeded over and forgotten. The warm chuffing of Mikado, Hudson, Consolidation, and Mountain steam locomotives has fallen to the droning roar of AC4400s, SD40, and FP7 diesels. The romance is mostly gone.<br />
But not forgotten.<br />
Humanity, in a sense, is a little strange. We choose to hold onto our pasts, no matter how trivial they may seem, for we think they might be of use to the future. It is because of that sentiment that we have traditions, we keep the old buildings standing, and preserve the things we hold dear.<br />
That sentiment brought me on a sunny Monday morning to the eastern side of Warden, a small settlement about 10 kilometres south of Stettler, Alberta. Though barely a blip on the map, it is the temporary home of an aging Canadian National Railway Mountain 4-8-2 steam locomotive, number 6060.<br />
This might not seem like much, but for me it&#8217;s a trip back to my childhood. My father turned me into a rail fan when I was very young. He built me a train set one year for Christmas, which I happily played with for many years. I loved taking the GO Train into Toronto whenever possible, and enjoy riding railed vehicles of all kinds. My father was also the one who introduced me to steam locomotives, specifically CN 6060.<br />
Built in October 1944, CN 6060 was the pinnacle of Canadian steam locomotive engineering. Based on the Northern 4-8-4 design, the Mountain 4-8-2 was lighter and more versatile, but still packed all the punch of its predecessor. Still, it meant weighing in at an awesome 687,540 lbs. (today&#8217;s modern freight diesels, by comparison, are a paltry 440,000 lbs.), stretching to 93 feet in length, and rising to 15 feet and 1.5 inches in height. Today, she is Canada&#8217;s largest operating steam locomotive.<br />
CN 6060 ran from late 1944 until 1959, when diesel finally supplanted steam in Canada. Although diesel electric locomotives had been around since 1918, it wasn&#8217;t until the &#8217;50s that diesel had enough power to outweigh steam locomotives, and their high operating costs. Steam locomotives were expensive to operate, and the maintenance on them was intense &#8212; each locomotive had to be stripped down and rebuilt every five years. CN 6060&#8217;s days had been numbered since the day she rolled out of the Montreal Locomotive Works.<br />
This is when the battle to save CN 6060 from the scrap heap began. Her engineer, Harry, wasn&#8217;t about to let her fade away like so many others. With the help of CN, 6060 came out to Alberta, where she went on static display in Jasper National Park. There she remained until 1972, when CN restored 6060 to run steam excursions from Toronto to Fort Erie. This is how I came to know the engine.<br />
I cannot tell you the first time I saw 6060 roar through Oakville. My father would take us up to the CN line, along with many other families, to watch the train whip through on its way west. It was always such a rush to see a huge column of smoke suddenly erupt from under the Royal Windsor overpass &#8212; it meant the train was almost here. Dad would always put pennies on the track to flatten them &#8212; something 3/5 of a million pounds does quite nicely.<br />
One day, when I was eight years old, my father took us up to the line to watch 6060 go by. He said it was the last time that we&#8217;d ever see her &#8212; she was going west to Alberta. For an eight-year old, that&#8217;s the other side of the planet. Donated to the Province of Alberta at the celebration of its centennial, she was to return to Jasper, where she would sit idle, known as &#8220;The Spirit of Alberta&#8221;. I never thought I&#8217;d see her again.<br />
The memories of that train stuck with me, and with the popularization of the Internet, I gained a way to find out what happened to my favourite engine that could. In the summer of 1997, I tracked CN 6060 down to the Alberta Railway Museum, who in turn pointed me to Alberta Prairie Railway Excursions. Although they used CN 6060 on some of their runs, they said the best people to talk to were at the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, owners and preservers of CN 6060. It took me nearly four years, but I finally got myself in gear, and made the trip out to see an old friend.<br />
Using directions supplied by my RMRS contact Al, I found myself barrelling through parts of Alberta I&#8217;d only ever heard of. Soon I was a mere 12 km south of Stettler, running north on Highway 56. Before long, I saw a line of box cars sitting off in the distance &#8212; something Al had told me to watch for. A sign soon appeared with the name &#8220;Warden&#8221;, and an arrow pointing west. Less than a kilometre down the gravel road, I crossed a nearly-abandoned railway line. Adjacent was a dirt road, running parallel to the box cars. Although there was no sign, it seemed the logical place to go.<br />
I drove slowly, not sure if I was in fact in the right place. But as I passed an old passenger car that bore the name &#8220;Alberta Prairie Railway&#8221;, I knew I was in the right place. Then I saw a tender, the kind used by 6060 &#8212; it even bore 6060&#8217;s number. And just behind a large red engine barn sat a machine I hadn&#8217;t seen in 21 years. Her outer jacket was off, her nose cone removed, but it was hard to miss the large brass numbers on her running boards that read &#8220;6060&#8221;.<br />
Three older men met me as I walked over, the first being the man who had directed me there, Al. The other two, Mitch and Larry, were looking up under the running boards at something I couldn&#8217;t make out. Al began to tell me about the locomotive, much of which I already knew. But I was more than happy to listen &#8212; this was a man who had worked with it.<br />
Being roughly noon, it was break time. I was led around to the other side, down to a retired CN caboose, which now doubled as the yard office. It had the one thing these men really wanted: the coffee maker. I sat and quietly listen as these men told me their days on the rails. There were all ex-CN, mostly retired though Larry had a day job with the petroleum industry. They told me about the caboose, the engine, and about Harry, the man who had spent the last 42 years trying to save 6060 from decay.<br />
As I listened, I constantly looked behind me to 6060. I almost couldn&#8217;t believe that I had &#8220;found&#8221; her again. I couldn&#8217;t stop smiling &#8212; not only out of plain happiness, but also from the stories Larry, Mitch, and Al told. I was informed that these stories were nothing &#8212; were I to stick around for dinner, I really get an earful.<br />
Break over, work resumed. But first, I was permitted to wander around. Gathering up my trusty camera, I took pictures of the locomotive from many angles. Al then let me into the cab, to look at the controls and where Harry had driven 6060 for over 30 years. After taking a moment to myself, I finished taking pictures, climbed out of the cab, and returned to my car.<br />
But my day was far from over. Donning an old pair of jeans, a ratty shirt, and my shoes, I returned to CN 6060. To help work on her.<br />
The past few months has seen the outer jackets removed, lines and insulation replaced. Although the engine is scheduled to make a run on 20 July, there is still a lot of work done. And from what Al had told me through email, every hand counted.<br />
It took a very short period of time for me to realise that for all the documentaries I&#8217;d watched and the books I read, I knew nothing when it came to steam engines. I felt like a five year-old asking his daddy &#8220;why?&#8221; &#8212; I must have driven Mitch crazy with all my questions. But he, and the others, were always willing to answer the questions without hesitation.<br />
My first job was to help replace one of the lines that runs from the cab up to the front of the boiler. Although I didn&#8217;t know exactly what the line did, it wasn&#8217;t too hard to do &#8212; it was mostly lifting and holding. (Well, it wasn&#8217;t hard in the sense that it didn&#8217;t take too much brain &#8212; but it took a lot of brawn, nothing is light on those locomotives.)<br />
I was soon called around for other little jobs: Grinding away painted &#8220;X&#8221;s that would make the boiler inspector wonder what was going on, scrubbing away rust at a new weld for the whistle assembly (and painting it), helping Larry and Mitch sort out what the heck they did wrong with a set of pipes and brackets, and all the while learning a little bit more about how it all works together.<br />
Maintaining a steam locomotive requires a lot of problem solving. It&#8217;s the ultimate in 3D puzzles &#8212; it only goes together one way, and if you&#8217;ve got it wrong, you have to figure out why on your own &#8212; the manuals no longer exist for these machines. This is how Mitch, Larry, and I ended up spending most of an hour trying to figure out where a set of lines were supposed to run. The logic was easy enough, but there was always something critical we were missing. Ultimately, Larry figured out that we&#8217;d mounted the pipes on the wrong site of the bracket. Thirty minutes later, the pipes were connecting properly once again.<br />
Harry arrived an hour or so after we started working. It was an honour to meet him at last. Although in excellent shape, Harry must be well into his 70s. This was a man who knew the 6060. The others often commented that their wives called the 6060 the &#8220;Iron Mistress&#8221;, with all the time she demanded. It was clear that Harry was quite willing to let the time be taken.<br />
As the afternoon wore on, I found myself almost every where on the locomotive, pulling this, hauling that, pushing something I didn&#8217;t know I was supposed to push, lifting insanely heavy dome lids, and running errands into the shed. But by far the weirdest experience was when Harry asked me to give him a hand with the firebox.<br />
There are two essential parts to a steam locomotive: The firebox and the boiler. Like its name suggests, the firebox is where the fire exists. In steam locomotives of this size, it&#8217;s big enough for several people &#8212; certainly large enough for the two of us.<br />
Donning a painter&#8217;s suit, we climbed inside the 6060&#8217;s firebox, Harry leading the way to show me how it&#8217;s done. I&#8217;m pretty much certain I wouldn&#8217;t do very well on a submarine. Although I was only in the firebox for about 10-15 minutes, it was enough to give me the creeps. Still, it was fascinating. I could see where the oil sprayed into the brick-lined pit (it used to be coal, before the 6060 was switched over to fuel oil), the blower grate at the bottom for air, and the huge superheater pipes that led out to the stack.<br />
Harry was inspecting the inside so he&#8217;d know what to say when the inspector arrived the following day. It&#8217;s not easy running a steam locomotive, and you really need to know what you&#8217;re doing. Luckily, Harry does.<br />
This mostly concluded the work day. While Larry and I were to head off for home. Harry, Mitch, and Al would return to Stettler to their motel room. It was another long, hard day to come. I only wished I could stay to help. But I had to return from the past and prepare again for the present. My real life called.<br />
But the dream is far from over. Engineers like Harry are a dying breed. New blood is needed to keep these machines running. People need to show others how we grew as a country &#8212; on highways made of steel. That is why I&#8217;ll be back again, to help work on the 6060, to bring her back to life and do what she does best &#8212; run full steam ahead.<br />
So why am I doing all this? Well, if you&#8217;ve read enough of my journals, you probably already know. The future is nothing without the past as its foundation. Or, as Harry likes to say: &#8220;We serve the future by preserving the past.&#8221;<br />
With luck, and a little bit of effort, the Spirit of Alberta will live forever.<br />

		<p>T minus 206 days until W-Day.<br />
And so the new year begins &#8212; the last of the second millennium, Ado Domini (or Common Era, if you prefer). It&#8217;s been a rough year for us, with many events having rocked our little world time and time again. Here&#8217;s the brief synopsis of the past year:<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The alarm went off at 6:45am. I was up almost immediately, Allison begged for &#8220;five more minutes&#8221;. I took the opportunity to quickly have some orange juice. Allison was in the shower moments later.<br />
We had to be at Yonge and Sheppard by 10:00am, and the trip would take about an hour. Allison wanted to get there in plenty of time, which meant we were catching the 8:03 GO Train from Clarkson.<br />
My dad delivered us to Clarkson station at 8:00. I jogged ahead of Allison and purchased tickets. After riding the GO Train for a year, I had a kind of sixth-sense that told me we had to hurry &#8212; and the time wasn&#8217;t my only tip-off. No sooner than we had our tickets in hand and were walking up the stairs to the platform did the train arrive. Like clockwork.<br />
The train went express at Clarkson, which meant we were downtown in about 20 minutes &#8212; a feat that is virtually impossible in a car at that time of day. (Of course, now that I&#8217;ve said that, one of you will probably try to prove me wrong.) Arriving at Union Station, we followed the other lemmings into the GO Concourse and into the subway.<br />
The furthest north on the Yonge line I had been was York Mills, where I got off during my tenure at Digital Equipment. That was nearly six years ago. (Six years? Oh boy, I can feel them gray hairs just popping out of my head &#8230; and the other hairs falling off.) We were heading to Sheppard, two more stops beyond that. Allison had no idea just how far north we were going.<br />
We were starving by the time we arrived. Luckily, there was a friendly neighbourhood McDonald&#8217;s on the McCorner. We indulged ourselves with a bit of McBreakfast (which is known to bring on period bouts of McNausea). The McPlace was not even half-full of people, but still took a while to get our McMeal. At first, I thought my McServer&#8217;s name was &#8220;Ebola&#8221; &#8212; imagine getting stuck with that name! As it turned out, her name was &#8220;Errola&#8221;. Dunno if that&#8217;s any better&#8230;<br />
About 9:30, we headed to the building where Allison was to have her meeting. During her departure, I was going to make a few phone calls to obtain information and make a general nuisance of myself.<br />
Allison was up there for two hours. It took me only 45 minutes to complete my tasks. (I also ran out of quarters for the payphone.) During that time, I got a tonne of information about setting up a webserver over an ASDL line, made arrangements for lunch and dinner, made an appointment for Allison at Arkipelago (my old Toronto haunt), and dropped a line to a few friends &#8230; none of whom were at their desks.<br />
That left me with a hour and 15 minutes to be bored out of my mind. I watched elevator load after elevator load walk by, none of them being Allison. After a while, I felt like a dog that watches all the cars go down the road, hoping one of them is its master. (No allusion drawing, please.)<br />
Following her seemingly-successful meeting, we headed downtown to meet with my cousin, Lauren. We went to one of her favourite restaurants, a tiny Thai bistro about a block south from Bloor. We had to wait a few minutes, but the wait was worth it &#8212; the food was good, and not too expensive (for a business-style Toronto eatery, that is).<br />
After lunch, we hopped the subway back down to Queen Street to walk to Arkipelago. It was strange walking down streets I hadn&#8217;t been on in two years. Things were at the same time familiar, but not. It was like someone had taken a picture of my old world, changed a few things, and then shown me the picture without telling me what they had changed.<br />
The familiar smell of Arkipelago was weaker than I remembered &#8230; but it had been two years since I last smelled the aroma of the wood and varnish that permeated the air. The space seemed a bit more cramped, especially with the additional people. When I had left Arkipelago, there were about 15 people. Over 30 people occupy its spaces. The people scattered everyone reminded me of what Arkipelago looked like when I started there.<br />
The meeting was with Diedre, one of Arkipelago&#8217;s newer acquisitions. We had hoped to meet with Tim or Todd, but they were both in Europe. Be that as it may, the meeting went very well, or at least so we thought. Following the discussion (which I was mostly a silent witness), I quickly visited with the Arkipelago veterans who were still there.<br />
We walked down to St. Lawrence Market, so I could show Allison Toronto&#8217;s idea of the Granville Island Market. Then it was off to meet Brenda and Marek at the Movenpick in BCE Place. We enjoyed an interesting dinner and a good discussion. Then we had to split ways and go home.</p>

		<p>Another birthday has come and gone, and save for a minor panic attack when I realised I wasn&#8217;t 21 anymore (yes, that <em>actually</em> happened, believe it or not), I&#8217;m doing okay.<br />
Things got off to a start on Friday, when Pure3D (my group at the office) went out to celebrate two birthdays &#8212; mine (obviously), and Neall, who is exactly one day older than me. (Although Neall&#8217;s birthday was the day before, we really didn&#8217;t get our act in gear to go out for lunch that day; we rolled two birthdays into one.)<br />
I was supposed to go to a softball game that night, but I opted not to go, rather wanting to spend some time with Allison doing something other than sitting at home, working on the computer or watching a movie. (No, we haven&#8217;t been out a lot as of late.)<br />
After making a quick trip to Burnaby to pick up Allison, we came downtown to go to our favourite Greek restaurant, Olympia, on Denman St. (Yes, Allison could have come downtown and saved me the trip, but I didn&#8217;t make up my mind until I got home.) Tyler joined us towards the end of our evening meal (having already had his dinner).<br />
The three of us wandered about the Denman Street area for a while, before ending up at Death By Chocolate for dessert. (It&#8217;s actually kiddie-corner to Olympia, but we didn&#8217;t want to stuff ourselves any fuller at the time.) Following dessert, we adjourned to Tyler&#8217;s place to continue with our in-depth conversation. Unfortunately, we strayed back onto the dreaded Theory of Relativity issue (see [[Canada Day in Kelowna, Winery Tours, and Penticton]]).<br />
The next morning, we headed out on our adventure of the day. For my birthday, Allison was taking me on the Royal Hudson. The Royal Hudson is a train of vintage cars driven by a steam-powered locomotive built in 1940. The locomotive is a 4-6-4 Hudson, number 2860. King George VI was very impressed by the locomotive&#8217;s performance when he and Queen Elizabeth (aka the Queen Mother) travelled across Canada by train in 1939. He bestowed the designation of &#8220;Royal&#8221; on the engine.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what they tell tourists. In reality, CP applied for permission to use the royal crowns and the &#8220;Royal&#8221; moniker to increase revenues by promoting a &#8220;royal&#8221; train. In fact, the entire 2860 class (numbers 2860-2864) all had the designation &#8220;Royal&#8221;.<br />
Despite its Royal lineage, the locomotive was taken out of service in the 50s, and put on freight service until the mid-60s. At that point, she was destined for museums. In the early 70s, enthusiasts convinced BC Rail that they should resurrect the Royal Hudson, and put it into regular service as a tourist train. The Royal Hudson now runs between May and October, running a short length of BC Rail&#8217;s track (BC Rail is the third largest Canadian railway after CP and CN) between North Vancouver and Squamish.<br />
We arrived about 15 minutes before departure, and hastily took our place on board in the end car, where we would have brunch. A few minutes later, the train softly lurched forward, and we were off.<br />
This part of the trip I had been on before &#8212; Allison had taken me on the Pacific Starlight last year (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]). Unlike the Starlight, however, this was a day-time excursion, and the trip ended in Squamish, not in Porteau Cove.<br />
Brunch began with a fruit cup, made of chunks of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple. We finished the cup just before entering West Vancouver. Apparently, we weren&#8217;t supposed to eat while waving to all the onlookers.<br />
The Royal Hudson, like most steam trains, attracts a lot of attention, even if the train makes two trips through West Van every day. It&#8217;s the only train allowed to blow its whistle. Another bizarre bylaw makes everyone wave at the train as it goes by, which forces everyone on the train to wave back.<br />
As we approached Horseshoe Bay, we were treated to the entrÃ©e: A large piece of freshly broiled salmon (it was about 1.5&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 5&#8243; in size). It rested on a thin slice of fresh focaccia bread, over a baby green salad with basalmic vinaigrette. The salmon was very good. Allison debated over whether it was better than last year&#8217;s salmon. It was certainly different &#8212; Allison thought it was better, whereas I thought it was on par; I thought last year&#8217;s fish was excellent.<br />
Dessert arrived around Porteau Cove &#8212; trifle. Unlike my father&#8217;s, which has a bottle of brandy (or sherry &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember which is it) at the bottom, this was cake, fruit, and custard. It was very tasty. This isn&#8217;t to say that my father&#8217;s trifle isn&#8217;t tasty &#8212; goodness knows he *loves* it &#8212; but this one was alcohol-free.<br />
Arriving in Squamish, we had several options. BC Rail makes a point of flogging the tourism on the Royal Hudson as much as possible. They even go so far as to hire tour operators to come on board and convince people to go on tours around Squamish, including a trip to Shannon Falls, a river-rafting tour, or flights over the nearby glacier. All of them are designed to fit into the two hours you have before the train departs.<br />
We opted for the tour that came with the price of the ticket &#8212; a visit to the West Coast Railway Heritage Museum, operated by the West Coast Railway Association. To get there, we piled into a vintage 1950s bus, which had scarcely put on 170,000 miles, and were whisked away to a train-lover&#8217;s paradise.<br />
The WCRHM is a 12 acre park, not far from the downtown terminus for Squamish. It sits just to the side of the main north-south BC Rail lines, facilitating easy delivery of new acquisitions.<br />
The park has many examples of old rolling stock (rail cars, passenger cars) and locomotives. It has the only remaining PGE steam train (the other two are lying at the bottom of lakes), one of the original diesel locomotives used to haul CP&#8217;s Canadian transcontinental train, and even a vintage 1890 business car (the equivalent of today&#8217;s LearJets).<br />
Trains aren&#8217;t Allison&#8217;s cup of tea, that much I&#8217;m certain of. But she let me have my day, even allowing me the joy of riding on a miniature railway (which cost a mere dollar per person). I enjoyed the whole day so much, I&#8217;m seriously considering joining the WCRA as a volunteer. Railways are a huge part of our modern society&#8217;s past, and I want to help them have a future.<br />
Filing back onto another bus, we returned to the Royal Hudson at about 1:15. As we couldn&#8217;t board until 1:30, I took the opportunity to take some pictures of the engine and the train. In fact, I took an entire roll of film that day. (Those of you who don&#8217;t know me that well should know that this isn&#8217;t an unusual thing for me &#8212; I tend to be a bit shutter-happy.)<br />
The return trip was almost as good as the trip up. This time, we were one car behind the engine. The whole way back, I could hear the chugging of the engine. Several times I went to the vestibules (the &#8220;doors&#8221; to enter the cars from the platform) to stick my head out and listen. I&#8217;m still washing out bits of sand and carbon from my hair&#8230;<br />
I was almost disappointed when we arrived back in North Vancouver, the trip over. Those trips always seem to go too quickly. We climbed down from the train, and make our way towards our car. The next stop was Horseshoe Bay, and off to the Island.<br />
Arriving at the Bay, I quickly noticed a problem &#8212; there was very little parking. In fact, after dropping off Allison and driving around a bit, I realised that there was no parking at all. Impark (the parking Nazis in the Lower Mainland) had even gone so far as to deny ferry passengers parking rights at one of the major lots.<br />
At first, I didn&#8217;t think we would make that ferry. Parking was limited. Luckily for us, at the time I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d make it, the ferry traffic was beginning to clear out. In other words, parking spots. Unluckily for us, it was in the most expensive lot: $10 a day.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo, we were picked up by the Collins (as usual) and taken home. Allison and I then stepped out for a while for dinner, allowing me to develop the pictures I&#8217;d taken earlier in the day.<br />
Returning home, I was ambushed by the Collins with a steam locomotive-shaped chocolate cake. Yes, I was a very happy camper that night. I had everything I wanted for my birthday &#8230; except my own family and friends, that is. Luckily for me, most of them sent me cards (both the traditional and the newer electronic variety).<br />
The next day was the day we had come to the Island for: The Comox Air Show. No, this is not a regular Collins (or Vailmont) family event. The only reason we were going (in fact, the only reason I knew there was a Comox Air Show) was Allison&#8217;s uncle Sean.<br />
Sgt. Sean Moran is one of an elite skydiving team called the &#8220;Skyhawks&#8221;. They&#8217;re the parachuting equivalent to the Snowbirds. Sean was one of eight people selected for a year&#8217;s service with the squad. Since May, he&#8217;s been jumping all over North America, including a drop in Oakville on 22 June.<br />
Piling into the Collins&#8217; Honda, we hit the road for the 1.5 hour trip to Comox. Upon arriving, we had another 1.5 hour wait until we got in. Unfortunately, we had taken the &#8220;front&#8221; door route &#8212; the one that was clearly marked. This was the &#8220;opposite&#8221; route to how Gerry and I had gone two years ago &#8212; the &#8220;back&#8221; route.<br />
So, along with about 10,000 other cars, we waited our turn to get into CFB Comox&#8217; field. At one point, we sat for a long time without moving. At first, I thought it was because there were complete idiots who didn&#8217;t know how to organise traffic. I would later find out it was because Allison&#8217;s Aunt Valerie&#8217;s friend Peter&#8217;s car broke down. He would later drive by us on his way home to get it fixed.<br />
Around 12:15, we finally reached the fence surrounding the field. A Buffalo (aircraft, not a mammal) circled above us. As we approached the gate, it dumped three streamers, which fell slowly to the ground. I suspected that it was to test the wind conditions for the Skyhawks. I was right &#8212; little did we know at the time, but Sean and crew were all in the Buffalo, waiting to jump.<br />
Before I progress any further, I should clear something up. Sean is younger than you think he is. He is married to Allison&#8217;s aunt Linda, who is only five years older than Allison &#8212; Sean&#8217;s only about five years older than me. Just in case some of you thought he&#8217;s some old geezer leaping from planes for a kick&#8230;<br />
Finally arriving in the base, we took a few minutes to stroll about. We went past some F-16s, some A-10s (which, last I heard, had been decommissioned), gliders, a C5 Galaxy, a couple of helicopters, and a small city worth of people.<br />
On our way to the field to sit and watch, the show started with one of the Skyhawks floating into the field, carrying an American flag underneath him. (Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s good reason for this &#8212; it was an &#8220;international&#8221; air show, which means the US Air Force had supplied a few planes for show.) He was quickly followed by another Skyhawk carrying a Canadian flag. This was kind of redundant, since all the Skyhawks have Canadian flag parachutes.<br />
Aside: For those of you who watch &#8220;Due South&#8221;, you may remember a series of Mounties who parachuted into the frozen north in the final episode, all with Canadian flag parachutes. I&#8217;ll give you two guesses who did the actual jumps. And no, Sean wasn&#8217;t with them at the time.<br />
No sooner had we taken our position that the next few Skyhawks came down, from a distance of 10,000 feet. The first few came in a stacked tower formation (one on top of the other). Another came down carrying smoke canisters under him. He flew into a spiral (on purpose) to create a &#8220;candy cane&#8221; swirling effect.<br />
Four more skydivers formed a diamond with their parachutes, at which point we heard Sean&#8217;s name come over the PA system. Although we cheered, we didn&#8217;t hear anyone else &#8212; I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d be able to hear the others cheer. As it turns out, finding them wasn&#8217;t a problem. I just followed Sean to where he landed &#8212; the rest of the family was there, waiting.<br />
Most of the family (at least from what I gather) was nervous &#8212; after all, he was jumping out of plane. How many people do that in the right minds? I, however, wasn&#8217;t the least bit worried. Now, this could partly be because I&#8217;d only seen Sean twice, and really don&#8217;t know him that well. However, I also knew that these were consummate professionals, who didn&#8217;t like taking risks. The odds of something going wrong were reasonably slim.<br />
After Sean collected his parachute, he and the rest of the team bounded over the fence (as well as someone carrying 30lbs of parachute can bound) and held an impromptu demonstration of how to pack a parachute back up. It was rather fascinating. We basically ignored the rest of the air show until Sean left, to go see the sponsors.<br />
Sean would return later in the show, taking Allison&#8217;s grandfather to the area reserved for base personnel and their family for a surprise presentation. I tagged along to take pictures.<br />
Sean had the Skyhawks sign a special poster, and place a sticker that said &#8220;Happy 80th Ernest&#8221;. In a quick ceremony, the captain of the team presented the poster to Allison&#8217;s grandfather, who was quite touched by the gesture.<br />
Skyhawks are brutally nice. Of course, they have to be &#8212; their ambassadors for the Canadian Armed Forces. They are effectively in media relations. Sean&#8217;s quite good at it, too. He rather likes it, so he told me. They were so nice as to sign brochures for us. Sean goes down as the first person I&#8217;d ever asked for an autograph.<br />
The Snowbirds were the last event of the show. In typical Snowbird-style, they put on a great show. We didn&#8217;t stay around for the whole event, however, as we had to catch a ferry home. We ducked out while they were still flying about. It almost felt like the Snowbirds were running cover for us as we drove out the exit.<br />
We returned to Nanaimo and prepared to leave for the ferry. We lucked out with another Ferry Classic, which meant we&#8217;d have good seating. Our trip was even complete with celebrities. Rather, celebrity.<br />
As I returned from the galley with empty hands (they had no frozen yoghurt on that trip), I caught the face of an elderly Asian man walking in my direction. It took me only a moment to realise that it was David Suzuki. <em>The</em> David Suzuki. Mr. Nature of Things. Allison was looking at me, her eyes bugged open, nodding vigorously, as if in agreement with the question I was apparently supposed to be asking, namely: &#8220;Is that who I think it is?&#8221;<br />
Upon reaching Horseshoe Bay, we exited the ferry, found the car, and dragged ourselves home.<br />
It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks, and we haven&#8217;t had a chance to slow down. Both Allison and I were exhausted when we got home. Although we had been planning to see the Nanaimo Bathtub Races this weekend, we&#8217;re probably not going to go, opting for some rest.<br />
Besides, it&#8217;s my turn to clean the apartment this weekend&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, for those of you who know me, is my birthday. For those of you who don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re excused. (Just keep in mind that you now know, and I expect to hear from you next year.)<br />
Today was also day from hell.<br />
Aside from the fact that it was uncharacteristically hot and muggy, it was also the second-to-last day to complete the work I had for the H-Spline group prior to their trip to Siggraph in Orlando. In other words, I hit the floor running at 07:05 this morning, and I haven&#8217;t stopped since. I am in a wee bit of pain, and I&#8217;m really tired.<br />
Upon getting to work, I quickly started writing the remaining parts of the documentation (beta release, we&#8217;re still a ways from finishing the thing) before I was brought before the Almighty Dave (Forsey, the brain behind the H-Splines). Then I shifted work to working on the copy for the Rodin (the name of our 3D Studio MAX plugin) brochure.<br />
Just before 16:00, I bolted out the front door, trying to get to the Skytrain as quickly as possible. Allison had told me not to be any later than 16:50, when she was going to pick me up. I don&#8217;t know what it was that she had in mind, but whatever it was, I expected it to be interesting, to say the least.<br />
I got home, doused myself with cold water (in a vain attempt to cool myself off enough to put on some nicer (and inherently warmer) clothes. I shaved, dressed, and bolted downstairs to meet Allison.<br />
Then she took me to North Vancouver, and still not telling me where we were going, pulled into the BC Rail passenger parking lot. This was my present. No, not the parking lot &#8230; and evening on the Pacific Starlight.<br />
Several years ago, BC Rail started purchasing vintage railcars (I think the most recently built car was from the 50&#8217;s), and overhauled them to function as dining cars. Then they pack a few hundred people on, and take you for a ride up the line to Porteau Cove. The train reverses direction, and goes back down the line.<br />
After a quick sprint to a Shell station to get some money, we boarded the train and took our seats. Allison impressed me highly by firmly believing that if your going to spend money, spend it well &#8212; she got the best seats on the train.<br />
The train departed from the station about 18:30, and slowly moved westward through BC Rail&#8217;s yard. Allison thought it a little strange that the yard was considered one of the features of the trip, but for rail buffs (such as I consider myself), this is as good a feature as any.<br />
We passed by the building that houses the Royal Hudson and the 3716, which are two steam engines BC Rail uses for hauling passengers and tourists to Squamish and back. It&#8217;s a trip I&#8217;d like to take some day. (I have a thing for steam trains, ever since riding my first as a little kid &#8230; the CN 6060, which ran between Toronto and Niagara Falls. It now rests at the Alberta Pioneer Railway in Edmonton.)<br />
We passed under the Lions Gate Bridge, and entered West Vancouver. Many people on the train probably thought it very strange that so many homes (especially expensive ones &#8212; West Vancouver is noted for its very high property prices) boardered on the rails. Apparently, when the PGR was bought up by BC Rail, they had let the line go into disrepair. During that time, many homeowners were told (usually by real estate agents) that they could use the land on the rails. In the mid-70&#8217;s, however, BC Rail employees came along and told them otherwise. Many were not pleased.<br />
Today, that&#8217;s an entirely different issue. The number of people who waved at us as we passed was very surprising &#8230; I had to actually wonder what these people did with their time &#8212; waiting for trains to pass by?<br />
We wound our way along the line towards Horseshoe Bay, moving at a relatively slow pace. There were three reasons for which I thought of for the slow speed, but only two seem really appropriate: reducing the motion of the cars so people could eat, and so people can see the view.<br />
And what a view. Wow. I mean that. Wow. It was amazing. It was such a relaxing trip, that I almost didn&#8217;t notice the lack of foot room under the table.<br />
We sat at a table with a slightly older couple, Ian and Yvonne, who were celebrating their first wedding anniversary together. We talked a little (mostly on the way back) about everything, including the trip Allison and I are going on tomorrow.<br />
The dinner was absolutely sumptuous. Allison had conned me earlier in the month into telling her what I would like to eat. In fact, the entire present was one big charade (I have to give Allison full credit for being completely devious), but I haven&#8217;t the least bit of a grudge for it. We both had a salmon dinner, which to date is the best fish I have ever had in my life.<br />
When we arrived at Porteau Cove, we found (much to our surprise) that the jazz band that had sent us off in North Vancouver had beaten us there (which in all reality wasn&#8217;t that hard &#8212; the train moved that slow) and was still playing when we arrived. Very classy, non?<br />
We had a 45 minute layover (for us to stretch our legs, and so the nicotine addicts could get their fix), so we wandered about a bit, looked at Porteau Cove Provincial Park (it&#8217;s a lot smaller than it sounds), and then wandered back to the train.<br />
The trip back has us facing backwards (passengers are guaranteed to face forward during one half of the trip), but it was no less spectacular. We had dessert, which was a chocolate mousse-like (albeit much denser) quasi-cake, the name of which I completely forget.<br />
Upon arrival back in North Vancouver, we returned to Allison&#8217;s car, and headed for home to finish packing and get ready to leave on our next great journey.</p>
