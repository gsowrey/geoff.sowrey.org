		<p>I honestly couldn&#8217;t wait for 5:00 to come this morning.<br />
Today is the start of my first break longer than a long weekend in almost a year. I&#8217;ve been working away on my job, barely taking time off, slaving through one of the hardest Christmases I can remember, and wondering whether anyone&#8217;s really noticed.<br />
I won&#8217;t even mention my lengthy list of non-work activities.<br />

		<p>First off, Happy New Year everyone!<br />
2003 was quite a year &#8212; quite a few good things, and a number of bad ones. In fact, not a lot of good ones, worldly-speaking, that is. Although not all the &#8220;Year in Review&#8221; lists are out yet, the ones that are on the Internet are (not surprisingly) mostly negative. Lots of death and tragedy, with the odd curling win to make things brighter. Let&#8217;s just hope this year comes with a little less strife than the year past.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Canada Day, most people take the time to go do something special, like visit events in their local community or town, possibly visit one of Canada&#8217;s majestic national parks (which are free today), or visit the local taverns and have one of Canada&#8217;s national beverages with friends.<br />
Me? I hang around with trains.<br />
Okay, before everyone gets all over me for doing &#8220;the train thing&#8221; again, I have to say that this is for the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, not me. Given the choice, I&#8217;d probably have hung out in and around the just-reopened Prince&#8217;s Island Park for the day. I probably would have avoided the killer sunburn I managed to get on my face. (You&#8217;d think that since I planned ahead and brought sunblock that I&#8217;d use it. Shows how much you know!)<br />
Every year on Canada Day, the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (I&#8217;m going to write &#8220;RMRS&#8221; from herein &#8212; it&#8217;s a long name to type) puts on a &#8220;show&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a show, but a chance for us to connect with some of the local enthusiasts, show off some of our equipment (the &#8220;Eagle Springs&#8221; combine car &#8212; no, not the farm type, a beautiful 1930&#8217;s passenger car, and our Alco S-3 diesel. This stuff usually just sits in Calgary because we can&#8217;t normally do anything with it. But on Canada Day, not only do people get to see this stuff, but they get to ride it, too.<br />
Starting last year, Don managed to get us into the old CP Ogden Shops (now the Alstom Shops) to hold our show. It&#8217;s very handy, since that&#8217;s where our equipment is being stored here in Calgary. It&#8217;s also convenient, since there&#8217;s a plethora of rail equipment from multiple owners all over the massive complex.<br />
We&#8217;d been out twice before Canada Day, getting things ready. Last Wednesday, it was vacuuming the cars and general clean-up. Yesterday, it was preparing the display and getting things roughly set up. And making a few repairs to CP&#8217;s display cars (graciously donated for the day so there was more than just our stuff around) &#8212; during switching, someone had flattened the railing needed to hook the stairs to get in. Nothing a blowtorch, sledgehammer, and prybar won&#8217;t fix.<br />
Don&#8217;t try this at home, kids, we&#8217;re experienced professionals. (We do this to 6060 all the time.)<br />
This morning was gorgeous. Which was great for me, since I had to spend the first 45 minutes awake in the gym. Arthur (friend, co-worker, and workout buddy) has put me on a new torture regimen. He claims my butt&#8217;s going to be in severe pain tomorrow. I truly hope not. Especially with all the walking and standing I did today&#8230;<br />
A massive volunteer crew &#8212; the largest I&#8217;ve ever seen for the RMRS &#8212; was beginning to assemble when I arrived at Ogden just after 11:00 (ironically enough, I was delayed by a freight train). Thus began an hour of hurried unpacking, setting up, moving of heavy objects, taping off areas verboten, and making sure everything was ready after the various cars were switched into their locations. CP loaned us the use of a SW 900 diesel-electric switcher (#6711), their historic mail car (#3266), and towed the train down the south side of the Ogden yard for about 2200 yards before returning, to give people a little ride.<br />
The crowd we got was a lot larger than I thought it would be. We don&#8217;t publicize this (for a variety of reasons), so we don&#8217;t get a lot of people. Still, most of our chairs were filled. It was pretty impressive, I think. We had the deputy mayor, the head of CP&#8217;s Heritage division, and representatives from the RCMP out to represent not only rail history, but of course, Canada&#8217;s history. It is Canada Day, after all.<br />
The afternoon shot by. Before I knew it, the clock read 16:00, and everyone was gone. We packed up, shunted the cars, and were ready to go home just after 17:00. Which was great, because my head was killing me.<br />
That&#8217;s when I realized I&#8217;d had too much sun. Tomorrow&#8217;s gonna hurt.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Okay, before you all say &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s Geoff and his trains again!&#8221;, I would like to emphasize &#8212; for the record &#8212; that I only did this because the Society was desperate for people.<br />
The Society, of course, is the Rocky Mountain Rail Society. But you&#8217;re thinking I was up working on 6060 all weekend, guess again. I remained in town &#8230; at Heritage Park. The Park is a recreation of life in a prairies town/city circa late 1880&#8217;s to around 1910 or so. Depending on where you are in the Park, you&#8217;ll see roughly appropriate recreations. (I think only a few things in the Park are authentic &#8212; most were rebuilt from pictures and plans.)<br />
One of the things Heritage Park has done for the last 17 years is hold something called &#8220;Railway Days&#8221;. It&#8217;s a draw that brings out more people to the Park, and causes the local modellers and rail hobbyist organizations to come out and show off their things. Naturally, this brings out the Society to show off what we&#8217;ve got, raise a few bucks for funding, and hopefully snag a few more members.<br />
Don, who organizes all the local events (I sometimes wonder if he actually sleeps at nights), asked me to be there most of the weekend &#8212; all of Sunday. I didn&#8217;t have any firm plans otherwise, and agreed. I arrived an hour early Saturday morning, expecting to have to go through the rigamarole of setting up the displays. Everything was already in place when I arrived.<br />
I had an hour to kill. This gave me an excellent chance to wander around the Park. I haven&#8217;t seen much outside of the roundhouse, coach house, and the main street. I didn&#8217;t go for a huge walk, but got a better idea of what the Park is like. Luckily, the weather was infinitely better than last year&#8217;s (for once, I have no entry to link to!) &#8212; it was bitterly cool and rainy the entire weekend, keeping the people away. On Saturday, we had bright, sunny skies, and though it started off a little cool, warmed up very nicely.<br />
We were put into the roundhouse, along with the other commercial interests. This was a little disheartening &#8212; we&#8217;re not commercial. We&#8217;re non-profit. We sell things, yes, but just to earn some money so we can pay for projects we need to do. As it stands, we only made $600 for the weekend, and our profit margins on that stuff is quite low.<br />
Of course, we&#8217;re not there so much to make money. Our goal is to raise awareness. We&#8217;ve been around almost 20 years now, but we&#8217;re not known outside the rail community. Even within the community, we regularly get stories that 6060 has been permanently retired and put up on static display. It&#8217;s particularly a challenge when we&#8217;re told this to our faces at trade shows.<br />
It&#8217;s so much easier when you can roll your steam locomotive into a town, pop open a door and announce &#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8221;<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have too much trouble with people finding us. As the roundhouse is a fairly major attraction, and we were right next to the door, we had a steady stream of visitors both days. Last year, we were in the Coach House, which is virtually buried behind the railway tracks and beyond the roundhouse. Unless you happen to see the signs, you are definitely going to miss it.<br />
Oh yeah, assuming you haven&#8217;t already figured it out, Heritage Park has its own self-contained railway. It&#8217;s nothing particularly fancy &#8212; a big loop with a turntable and roundhouse, a siding for storing the &#8220;freight&#8221; train, and two stations. Two locomotives ply the rails on Railway Days (usually, it&#8217;s just one), both 0-6-0 switchers. They&#8217;re painted as CP 2023 and CP 2024.<br />
It&#8217;s with some irony that in a CP town, Heritage Park ended up with two small steam locomotives originally from (of all places) the US Army. Both started off with the Army, moved to New Westminster in BC where they worked the docks until the mid-60s. They eventually found their way to Heritage Park where they were fixed up and put to use. (They were originally US Army #4012 and #4076.)<br />
Heritage Park does have two actual CP steam locomotives: another 0-6-0, #6144, which now operates with a diesel engine; and CP 5931, one of two preserved Selkirks (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Canadian Railway Museum]]) &#8212; the largest locomotives used in Canada. (There is widespread belief 5931 could run again, but the politics behind doing so dwarf the massive engine by many times.)<br />
Amidst people coming and going (and Don running around to help out with the presentations), I made a couple of opportunities to go take pictures. When you&#8217;ve got two steam locomotives double-heading (basically, running end-to-end), you make an effort. Especially if the weather&#8217;s good.<br />
Early afternoon arrived, and we had so many people at the booth that I didn&#8217;t see a need for me to be there anymore. So making sure all was well, I ducked out to enjoy the rest of my afternoon.<br />
Sunday, it rained. It was raining when I got up, it rained off and on until just before lunch, and then rained pretty much consistently for the rest of the day. Naturally, this staved off the numbers of people we&#8217;d seen the day before, but it wasn&#8217;t *so* bad. It gave us more time to watch the videos we show constantly.<br />
I spent all Sunday at Heritage Park. It wasn&#8217;t the most rivetting way to spend the day, but at the same time I can certainly think of worse things to do.<br />
Besides, I got to watch the trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While this weekend was absolutely amazing, too many of these and I&#8217;ll die from exhaustion.<br />
I started early Saturday morning. Those of you who are chiming in with &#8220;must be train stuff&#8221; can smile smugly &#8212; &#8216;cuz you&#8217;re right. But it wasn&#8217;t with 6060. This was my first chase since 6060 last year (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]), and this was a lot more challenging. 6060 doesn&#8217;t move very fast &#8212; it can&#8217;t because of the track it runs on. This chase, however, as significantly faster.<br />
The Canadian Pacific Railway is taking their steam locomotive, 2816, out east on the &#8220;Breakfast for Learning&#8221; tour. It&#8217;s the biggest run they&#8217;ve done since the engine was overhauled. From here to Toronto and back, in about 45 days, making a lot of stops between here and Toronto. Saturday was their first leg, from Calgary to Medicine Hat. And I wanted to follow it across the prairies.<br />
I decided I would pick up the train at the old CP Ogden shops (now owned and operated by Alstom). Although the east end of Alyth had a great place to take a picture with a bridge, the light wasn&#8217;t cooperative, and there was no place to park my car. I was the first to show up at my location, but I was soon joined by a few others: the director who was responsible for the locomotive and the train, one of the other members of the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, the parents of one of the train&#8217;s crew, and a guy who had been born and raised in the Ogden area and who&#8217;s father had opened the nearby Ogden Garage in the 1920s.<br />
The train was to leave at 7:00, but started off the day running late, for some reason. When it finally reached us, around 7:20 or so, it looked gorgeous, and running beautifully. It passed by at about 30 km/h &#8212; not very fast. Not yet, anyway. Piling into my car, I gave chase.<br />
I was hoping to catch the train at the east end of the intermodal yard on the east side of the city. But due to a wad of people getting in my way, the train ended up alluding me. Because of the much warmer weather than the last time I chased 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]), there was no steam cloud to see at a distance. All I had to rely on was the fireman every so often putting too much oil in the burner and creating a bit of smoke. I still don&#8217;t have a scanner, which makes following the train&#8217;s progress very difficult.<br />
Passing the intermodal yard, I started onto a gravel road, with two other cars in front of me. I couldn&#8217;t see anything but the dust cloud they kicked up. Finally, we reached a paved road, and I turned south to try and catch up. I reached 22X, and headed east again. I had no idea where the train was, other than it was ahead of me.<br />
The new map I had purchased at the ESSO station actually showed where the railway went, and I still had to go a fair bit south to find the line again. That&#8217;s the problem with chasing trains on the prairies &#8212; the highways rarely follow the tracks. At least on the Laggan sub, I can keep up because there ain&#8217;t a lot of room &#8212; and there the highway *does* follow the railway.<br />
I raced down Highway 24, hoping I&#8217;d be able to catch the train down there. Just as I came over a hill near to where the 24 turns east, I saw the train coming to the crossing. I arrived mere seconds before the train crossed it, but I didn&#8217;t have time to get a picture. The chase was on again!<br />
Further down the road, I stopped in a farmer&#8217;s field east of Carseland to take a picture. As the railway was curving away again, I had to race down more highways to hook back up again. I turned out on to Highway 817 and then onto 901 to continue following. At this point, the train wasn&#8217;t too hard to follow &#8212; the tracks weren&#8217;t too far from the road. The train got held up in Strangmuir for 15 minutes to undergo some greasing, which allowed me to find a comfy little field that sported a small bridge that the train was going to go over. There I found one of CP&#8217;s rail traffic controllers (RTCs), who dispatched the Brooks sub (the line we were both chasing down). He didn&#8217;t go on shift until noon, so had some time to chase.<br />
I caught the train again where the tracks cross the 901, along with a few others including an A-Channel truck. Then to Gleichen, where I met a rather racist CP police officer, snapped a photo, and ran off to Cluny. There, I met up with the RTC again. He suggested Bassano as the next decent stop, so off we went. This time, I followed him, and it was good that I did. He led me right to the best spot to get a picture. Pretty much where everyone else chasing the train was: an old CP railway station and a rather large yard.<br />
There I met a couple of far more professional photographers who suggested my next venue: the Brooks Aqueduct. Once the train had left, we were off. Brooks is about 180 kilometres southeast of Calgary, heading towards Medicine Hat. Brooks is pretty much the last stop before you enter the vast, barren plains of the southern prairies. There ain&#8217;t much in Brooks, which really surprised me when I saw on my map a marker for &#8220;Brooks Aqueduct National Historic Site&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find. All you have to do is find the sign on the highway, and drive south until you see a huge concrete aqueduct, like a modern version of a Roman aqueduct.<br />
But modern it isn&#8217;t. I parked in the interpretive centre&#8217;s lot, and was immediately met by Lee, one of the two interpreters at the site. She was a little puzzled by why I was there &#8212; though most of their visitors come from Calgary. I explained that I was chasing a train. Yes, I did get a rather strange look. She recommended that I walk down the aqueduct canal to the siphon, which was apparently the best place to see trains in the area. Thanking her for the advice, and promising to come back, I went off in search of my quarry.<br />
The canal is a huge earthen trench built up on the floor of the shallow valley that Brooks sits in. Barely 100 metres to the north of the canal is the old aqueduct, no longer in service. (More on it in a moment.) I walked until the canal &#8220;ended&#8221; at the railway &#8212; where an inverse siphon runs under the railroad and re-enters the canal on the other side. The siphon works on the venturi principle &#8212; basically, what goes in has gotta come out.<br />
I was well ahead of the train, which gave me a lot of time to wander around and find the best place to take a picture. By the time I&#8217;d found the ideal place, three more photographers showed up, including the guys who&#8217;d told me about the place. We took our positions and waited.<br />
Soon, the light appeared in the distance, and the train raced towards us. Though not going at full speed, it didn&#8217;t take long to pass. I have to completely agree with Lee and the photographers &#8212; the aqueduct was the best place to see this train.<br />
I returned to the interpretive centre, where Lee came out to meet me. I asked her for her perspective on the aqueduct. (I told you I was getting back to this.) Back in the early 1900s, CP was in the colonizing business. There was a lot of money to be made in bringing people to the west. Especially if you&#8217;d bought all the land around the railway tracks when you built them, and sold it off to the immigrants who paid you to come west. However, not all parts of the west were ideal for farming &#8212; some are quite dry.<br />
Such is the case with the area east of Brooks. No significant rivers, no lakes, and little rainfall poses a lot of problems. To make the area saleable, CP had to provide water for irrigation. This lead to the need to dam the Bow River at Bassano, then move the water through canals to the east. At Brooks, the land forms into a shallow valley that created a problem &#8212; without massive (and expensive) pumps, there was no way to get the water to the east. CP&#8217;s engineering department came up with the solution: the Brooks Aqueduct.<br />
At 3.2 kilometres long, and upwards of 90 feet tall, it was the largest aqueduct in the world at the time. It pushed all the boundaries of construction knowledge, which also led to problems. Most revolutions don&#8217;t go off very well the first time. The alkaline water dissolved the concrete, the lead expansion joints leaked constantly, the spars across the top of the sluice caused backflow, and the 0.01% grade kept the water moving so slowly that silt, plants, and even fish slowed the water flow. The aqueduct only ever reached 2/3 of its planned capacity. After an extensive and expensive overhaul in the 1930s, the aqueduct was turned over to the local farming collective.<br />
By the 1970s, the aqueduct was costing too much to repair. The local governments decided to replace it with an earthen canal that provided more water than the aqueduct ever could have (even if it had reached full capacity), and doesn&#8217;t leak. The old aqueduct was made a National Historic Site in the 1980s.<br />
I drove down the length of the aqueduct to get a good look at it. Well, as much as I could. Once decommissioned, the aqueduct no longer received maintenance. To prevent injury, a fence runs around the perimeter. A gap in the fence did allow me to sneak in for a couple of pictures from underneath. The western end, completely cut off from the original water supply, is now home to the local party hangout, identified from the graffiti, countless broken beer bottles, and the still-smouldering remnants of a fire. The view down the aqueduct is something else.<br />
It was about then that I noticed the time: 12:45. I needed to be back in Calgary for a party at 14:00. I was going to be late.<br />
I pulled into the car wash at 16th Ave. and Edmonton Trail just before 15:00. The car had turned a brownish green (from all the dust), with multicoloured speckling (from all the bugs). It was shiny in only a few minutes. Then it was my turn to get clean.<br />
I arrived at Shantie&#8217;s house just before 16:00. This was a soccer party, and as near as I could figure, I was one of the only non-soccer people invited. Needless to say, I wasn&#8217;t too keen to leap right into the game. Mostly because I haven&#8217;t played since high school, and even then I was terrible. I resolved to sit in the weak shade of a tree (not all the trees here have sprouted leaves yet) and take pictures. The six-year old daughter of one of the guests noticed it right away and asked if she could use it. It&#8217;s a durable little thing, and I figured &#8212; could get some interesting pictures.<br />
The girl, Shayla, took almost 150 pictures over the next few hours.<br />
The game ended around 17:00 and we retreated to Shantie&#8217;s house (across the street from the soccer field) to engage in conversation and food. John (one of the other guests) tried to engage in a battle of wits with Shayla. The six year old won, hands down. It was just the beginning.<br />
Shantie has some really great friends. They&#8217;re hilarious to hang around with, and are in no way exclusionary. They even knew when to pick on me because I brought veggie burgers. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone vegan &#8212; but I&#8217;ve had these sitting in my freezer for a year, and I gotta eat &#8217;em.)<br />
I ended up talking with Lindsay for over an hour about Japan. (She&#8217;d been there in high school.) We talked until it was just too cool to be away from the fire pit everyone else had gathered around. (I should note that it was gorgeously warm, and it was just a slightly cool breeze that was making it uncomfortable. Besides, we were feeling left out.)<br />
By midnight, everyone had left, including myself. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, was harbouring a half-dozen sunburns, and needed some serious sleep.<br />
Today was the Lilac Festival in Calgary. I didn&#8217;t go to it this year, as I felt I had more pressing things to take care of: namely the small army of dandelions that were laying siege to my front lawn. Screwdriver in hand, I went to eradicate the little buggers from my grass.<br />
Most people use chemicals when they get rid of weeds. I&#8217;m not a big fan of chemicals in the yard, not even fertilizers. I prefer the natural, brute force methods. I even use an unpowered push mower to cut my grass. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard work, but you feel better for it. Especially when total strangers thank you for not using chemicals.<br />
While there was still a lot of afternoon left, I went for a walk along the river, taking in the sights and sounds of the World Walk, or something like that, taking place at Prince&#8217;s Island Park. I didn&#8217;t spend long, so I don&#8217;t really know what it was all about. I had a mission: I needed to get my bike.<br />
People were everywhere. Calgary becomes very active when it gets warm. When there&#8217;s a festival on, you almost have problems moving at times. Along all the major strips, the patios are open and full. Everyone is enjoying the outdoors again. Summer is definitely here.<br />
Now if it would just rain so we could all cool off&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We woke up relatively early this morning. For anyone on vacation, that&#8217;s before noon. For us, it was around 09:00. The goal today was Mount Fuji, about an hour south of Tokyo.<br />
An hour by bullet, that is.<br />
Following the usual rise-and-go routine of the morning (shower, shave, etc.), we made a run to the 7-11 before heading to the train. I know it sounds really strange to say we&#8217;re going to a 7-11, even when I&#8217;m in very urban (almost rural) Japan. One thing you&#8217;ll find there is there are a lot of American chain stores and restaurants: Starbucks, AM PM, Lawson&#8217;s (which I hadn&#8217;t heard of before coming here), Subway, the ubiquitous McDonald&#8217;s, 7-11, Red Lobster, and even Denny&#8217;s.<br />
In most cases, though, the store/restaurant is very different than in North America. For example, you won&#8217;t find pretty much any North American food in a 7-11 &#8212; it&#8217;s all Japanese food, although along similar lines that you&#8217;d find in a North American 7-11. (And beer. You don&#8217;t get that in Canada.) One of the neat things are these little triangular rice cakes wrapped in nori (seaweed), usually with some sort of extra flavouring, like salmon, pork, and so forth. They&#8217;re amazing for breakfast.<br />
The really cool thing about these triangles is in how they&#8217;re packaged. The seaweed needs to be kept dry, while the rice needs to stay moist. This is done by using the most elaborately-arranged plastic wrapping that I&#8217;ve ever seen. Once you see how it works, it&#8217;s truly elegant, though it is a little confusing at first.<br />
Upon arriving in Tokyo, we made our way to the Shinkansen area. The Shinkansen are the legendary Japanese &#8220;bullet&#8221; trains. They run at extremely high speeds (about 250 km/h), and are extremely convenient when getting between cities that are close enough not to fly, but far enough that driving is just inconvenient. (Of course, if you don&#8217;t have a car, then the train is all the better.) They&#8217;re not the fastest trains in the world (that record is held by France&#8217;s TGV), but they&#8217;re no slouches, either.<br />
The Kodomo Superexpress runs from Tokyo terminal to Shi-Osaka, making about 10 stops along the way. The distance is quite far &#8212; probably about 400 kilometres or more. (That&#8217;s a guess, as I have no maps or figures.) It&#8217;ll do the trip in about two hours, including the station stops.<br />
The Shinkansen lines are separate from the other rail lines used for regular commuter trains. The slower-speed trains use jointed rail (lengths of rail linked together with plates). This is fine for slow-speed travel, but not for high-speed passenger travel. The gaps between the rail lengths would cause shuddering in the train as it slammed across them. The rails would deform and the wheels of the train would be damaged. So much more expensive (and labour-intensive) continuous welded rail must be used instead.<br />
The Shinkansen itself is like an airplane. The seats are built roughly the same way, but are a little lower (assumedly for the smaller stature of the average Japanese person) and have no seat belts. The train runs so smoothly that you have no need for one.<br />
The train pulled out of the station at about 12:15. It accelerated to about 100 km/h within a very short distance of the station, but didn&#8217;t go much faster until we were outside Tokyo city limits. This wasn&#8217;t because of safety &#8212; this was because the tracks had to follow a very curvy path before being allowed to run straight. Shinkansen, like any high-speed train, prefers straightaways over curves.<br />
You can&#8217;t really feel the acceleration of the train, like you would an airplane taking off, but you do notice the change in speed. I&#8217;ve heard from several people who have ridden the TGV that the movement is noticeable, but only if you&#8217;re paying attention. Otherwise, the motion is almost magical.<br />
Soon, the countryside was whipping by at speeds that would make my eyes hurt if I tried to follow something that was fairly close to the train. The city quickly gave way to smaller towns and villages. Farms, old houses, small factories, rivers &#8230; the rural life passed us by faster than the time most rural folk give thought to the trappings of city life.<br />
The plains of the coast gave way to mountains, and the train started darting in and out of mountains. I think there are more tunnels on the Kodomo line than there are in the entire Canadian Pacific Railway system. High speed trains don&#8217;t go over or around mountains &#8212; they go through them. And sometimes so fast and frequently, you can actually start to feel your ears pop from the constant pressure change.<br />
Just outside of Mishumi, we caught our first glance of our quarry &#8212; Mount Fuji, off the in the distance. It wasn&#8217;t quite what I expected. The &#8220;traditional&#8221; crown of white snow was little more than stripes, assumedly from the spring melts. I can only assume the white cap is only in winter. I snapped pictures from the train as we passed through.<br />
We had been told by many people that the place to see the mountain was in Shizuoka. We stayed on the train until we got to the stop. According to maps and photos, we could go a short distance and obtain some very nice photos. However, there was a minor problem &#8230; we couldn&#8217;t see the mountain.<br />
Chris enquired, and we were told that we were better off going back one stop on the local Tokaido line to obtain a better picture. Hopping on the local train, we found the situation not any better. Apparently, we had run into Fuji&#8217;s most famous problem. According to Chris&#8217; friend Shinichiro, Mount Fuji is very shy. We had just found out how shy it was.<br />
We returned to Shizuoka, and took the next Shinkansen to Shin-Fuji, which apparently was the best place to see the mountain when the weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating. By the time we arrived in Shin-Fuji, clouds had almost entirely obscured the mountain. Living near mountains myself, I know how volatile the weather can be. Figuring it wasn&#8217;t quite worth leaving just yet, Chris and I decided to grab a bite to eat and hope the weather clears.<br />
Not wanting to stay at the station, we went in search of a restaurant. An initial look around the station wasn&#8217;t terribly promising. So Chris enquired about the location of downtown Shin-Fuji from some bus drivers. They laughed incredulously.<br />
&#8220;Downtown?&#8221; they cried, &#8220;There&#8217;s no downtown here!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What do you do for fun?&#8221; Chris asked.<br />
&#8220;Go to Tokyo.&#8221;<br />
Not wanting to take that for a literal answer, we decided to find out what Shin-Fuji was all about. Heading south of the station, we found our way to the corner of the major street near the station and what appeared to be a local highway. We followed it for a couple of kilometres before deciding to turn north and wander through a neighbourhood to see what we could find.<br />
Not much.<br />
It seems that the bus drivers hadn&#8217;t been kidding &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a heck of a lot of anything in Shin-Fuji. All we found were varying states of nothing. All we got were stunned looks from some of the locals. I mean, what were a pair of gaijin (one a tattooed black man) doing wandering through a neighbourhood like theirs? Had they become lost from the train?<br />
We ended up back at the station, completely empty-handed, and hungry. North of the station wasn&#8217;t any better, although we didn&#8217;t walk even remotely as far before giving up. Instead, we caught the next eastbound Shinkansen to Tokyo. The trains&#8217; gently motion soon put me to sleep.<br />
We got off in Chiba, rather than continue all the way to Yotsukaido. Chris wanted to pick up a gift for Kaz, and we would get something to eat before heading home for the night. After our stop at Yodobashi Camera, we hit a restaurant that features izakawa-style food, which is basically the Japanese version of pub food (though much better prepared and probably a lot better for you, too).<br />
So far, I&#8217;ve had several varieties of Japanese food, and I like them all. Even the dreaded natto. The best part is that almost all of it is very good for you, too. Japanese cuisine, even the stuff that&#8217;s considered &#8220;fast&#8221;, is so much healthier than North American food. I can only guess how much weight I could lose here from eating better. I only wish such foods were readily available in Canada.<br />
It&#8217;s an odd thing, really. The Japanese have some of the best diets in the world, but simultaneously are some of the heaviest smokers I&#8217;ve seen in years. The dichotomy of healthy/unhealthy habits is quite astonishing.<br />
We were back in Yotsukaido before 22:00 &#8212; Chris has some design work to do, and having an early evening for a change sounded good.<br />
Besides, it gave me a good excuse to hit the 7-11 for dessert. A couple snacks, a bottle of Fanta Fruit Punch, and we were back to rest and relax for an evening. Tomorrow, the tour of Tokyo!<br />
Oh, and Haagen-Dasz makes a killer green tea ice cream.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By comparison with yesterday&#8217;s activities, it would appear that I slept the entire day away.<br />
For starters, I awoke after 10:00, the long day previous having sapped pretty much all my energy. Kaz was still here, but preparing to leave for Toyohashi. I needed a shower, and badly,<br />
This was my first Japanese shower. Western showers are tall things, often allowing you to stand vertically while cleaning. In Japan, the shower is a small, open tub in a well-tiled room that has a shower head mounted to the wall.<br />
Japanese flats, or at least Chris&#8217;, has no running hot water (there is cold water). All hot water comes from a small water heater that sits right next to the tub. It feeds hot water as needed.<br />
It was then that I realized the things I had forgotten for this trip. Phone numbers aside, I had also managed to forget shampoo and conditioner. I don&#8217;t think my scalp will have too much trouble with this humid climate, so hopefully, I&#8217;ll be alright.<br />
Kaz left around 11:30, leaving Chris and I to kill a little time until 13:30, when it was time for Chris to go to work. Today, he taught a class in Narita. (Chris teaches in several places, including here in Yotsukaido &#8212; this just happens to be roughly in the middle of his various teaching gigs.)<br />
I would go the opposite direction, to Chiba City. Yes, I was there last night, but I wanted to see the city in the daytime. So Chris entered one platform, and I went to another. Chris looked perfect at ease waiting for his train. I felt a little &#8230; odd.<br />
I&#8217;m finally understanding what it feels like to be the only person of a particular race in an area. Since arriving, Jan is the only other Caucasian I&#8217;ve actually met. Today, I didn&#8217;t see a single other non-Japanese (not counting Chris).<br />
It&#8217;s actually neat in a way &#8212; it&#8217;s a slight special feeling, but at the same time, no-one really seems to care. It&#8217;s kind of like: &#8220;oh, look, a strange gaijin&#8230;&#8221; and I&#8217;m forgotten within a few steps.<br />
In fact, the only longer glances I got were from the school girls. And no, this is not a fantasy come true.<br />
I do need to make a note of this, though. Japanese school girls pretty much meet the stereotype we&#8217;ve seen in the west: the uniforms, the giggling, and the really creepy sexuality that either their completely innocent of, or completely aware of (and you have no idea which it is). Suffice to say, I saw one girl eating an ice cream cone and &#8230; well, it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve not yet forgotten.<br />
Chiba doesn&#8217;t look much different in daylight than it did at night. The biggest difference were the throngs of people &#8212; far more than last night. Of course, it was also a weekend (it&#8217;s Saturday), so it might have also been weekend trips to the semi-big city.<br />
I wandered around a little, trying to follow the route we&#8217;d taken last night, only in reverse. I missed a turn, though, and ended up with a longer walk. Not that I minded.<br />
I snapped pictures as I wandered around: the monorail and its tracks, the canal it runs overtop of (and the fish that swim in it), city streets, cars, and people &#8212; specifically, a guy dressed in a frog suit trying to entice people to enter a pachinko parlour.<br />
Along the way, I decided to visit Parco, a local department store In many ways, Parco reminds me of The Bay or of Eaton&#8217;s. Lots of small boutique-like areas with each floor dedicated to a specific need. The prices were about right in line with what you&#8217;d expect in Canada.<br />
I refrained from buying anything. This is for two reasons: One, I need to look around a little more, first. Second, I have very little money. This is due to lack of foresight on my part. I have no traveller&#8217;s cheques. I had assumed, rather foolishly I might add, that I could use my bank card here to obtain Yen directly. So far, I have yet to find an ATM that can access the North American networks. And I haven&#8217;t set up my credit cards to allow funds withdrawals.<br />
To anyone coming to Japan for a visit, remember to bring either traveller&#8217;s cheques or a healthy amount of yen. Getting access to the funds you need from your back without a lot of trouble is, well, a lot of trouble. In fact, after two days, I get the distinct feeling I&#8217;ll need to go into Tokyo to finally get out some cash.<br />
I found my way back to Yotsukaido without too much difficulty. After taking a couple pictures of the train station, I headed back to Chris&#8217; flat to rest a little while before going out to take more pictures. I decided to watch one of Chris&#8217; movies (Blade II) and take a little nap. Chris woke me a bare half-hour ago (it&#8217;s now 20:45), having fallen asleep on this futon.<br />
The loose plan now is to go to something called a &#8220;VJ party&#8221; in Shibuya, one of the districts of Tokyo. The catch? If we go, we&#8217;re there until 05:00 at the earliest &#8212; the trains don&#8217;t run after midnight.<br />
I want to go &#8230; I just hope my body is ready for this.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long time, but I&#8217;ve gone back to school.<br />
The last time I took a class (see [[Why I Don&#8217;t Want to be a Technical Writer Anymore]]), it was for work. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything I didn&#8217;t already know, and I wasn&#8217;t really all that happy about it. This time, I&#8217;m taking something I have (some will say) far too much interest in, and (so far) have been really happy with. What is this wonderous education that I&#8217;m receiving? What is this subject in which I&#8217;m so engrossed?<br />
I&#8217;m going to Steam School.<br />
Okay, you can stop groaning now. Yes, this is related to trains. But not in the same over-the-top manner many seem to expect from me. (Either I&#8217;ve set far too many precedents, or people seem to expect a lot.) It&#8217;s actually an Antique Steam course, which is something I need to take so I can start my safety training for steam boilers.<br />
Why steam boilers, you ask? Remember my girlfriend? (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]].) Well, she needs more people trained to maintain and operate her. There&#8217;s a lot of work involved with running a steam locomotive, especially one with a boiler the size of 6060&#8217;s. And with the bulk of our society getting older every year, we&#8217;re in a pinch to make sure our newer members (e.g. me) have the necessary training.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; the course I&#8217;m taking now doesn&#8217;t even come close to qualifying me to even getting me in the cab while the locomotive is running. As with all things, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Once I&#8217;ve obtained this permit, then I can start working towards my Class 5 permit. That will, at least, get me in the cab during operation. Then it&#8217;s a matter of time and training before I can write my Class 4. I need a Class 4 to operate 6060&#8217;s boiler &#8212; in other words, apprentice to be a fireman. (It&#8217;ll be a number of years before I can be an engineer.)<br />
The class met at Pioneer Acres, a museum in Irricana, about 45 minutes northeast of Calgary. The village of Irricana is small, only about 1,000 people. It was likely once a railway town (the CN mainline &#8212; formerly Grand Trunk Pacific&#8217;s &#8212; to Edmonton runs through Irricana), but has since become little more than a small farming community. The village is surrounded by vast acreages.<br />
Our instructor was late, caught in the snow where he lives. Although a chinook and the onset of spring has pretty much wiped out the snow in most of Alberta, some parts are still in a deep freeze. No-one seemed to mind too much, though. For the $100 fee, a large number of us are having the fees covered by employers or our respective museums and historical societies. It gave us a chance to get to know eacy other a little better.<br />
The instructional material is &#8230; well, not so much in-depth as it is cohesive. Sounds a little odd, I know, but allow me to explain. Although I haven&#8217;t spent a huge amount of time with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, my education started the day I showed up in Warden (see [[Reunion with Steam Locomotive CN 6060]]). Sometimes it&#8217;s just someone telling me the name of a strange blob of cast iron. Sometimes, it&#8217;s telling me how it works. If I&#8217;m really lucky, I get to see it in pieces. However, none of it really seemed to make sense.<br />
The course I&#8217;m in is primarily aimed at safety. Steam engines (stationary boilers, traction engines, and locomotives alike) are all very dangerous. Even a stationary pressure vessel with pressures as low as 20psi can explode with disasterous consequences. 6060&#8217;s boiler runs at 260psi. As you can guess, safety is covered repeatedly during the session. The safety isn&#8217;t so much for us (though that is important), it&#8217;s mostly for the public. No steam engine would exist today were it not for the public wanting to see it operate. They&#8217;re far too expensive to own and operate without funding. So with the crowds we expect come the rules needed to operate them.<br />
Over the last two days, I&#8217;ve received a very clear picture of how certain elements of a steam boiler operate. Most of them to me were textbook concepts. Our instructor make sure that the ideas that once seemed so simple were carefully explained. Luckily, we have several in the class who can explain things a little further. The SAIT instructor even managed to fill in the missing bit of information that finally cleared up how a steam injector operates. (Of course, having some knowledge of physics and thermodynamics actually does come in handy.)<br />
I still get strange looks from friends and coworkers whenever I tell people about the things I do in my spare time. I guess most people expect that I would work on a computer all the time. With my job being close to the leading edge of computer technology, I guess I prefer having a hobby that has nothing to do with computers at all. There&#8217;s a certain amount of relaxation that comes from working with something that predates the electronic age. Something that has no knowledge of microprocessors (the federally-mandated radio notwithstanding), no cares about lines of software code, and no relation whatsoever to the mass-produced garbage of our era.<br />
It might weigh more than 23 times the average city bus, but our nigh 60 year-old toy always seems to lift off the worries of my little world.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Another year, come and gone&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t. This has perhaps been the single most turbulent year of my life. I had the deep low of my father&#8217;s death, coupled with the meteoric high of participating with the CBC 50th Anniversary train. Many times I thought I was going to lose my sanity or even my job. Perseverence, not to mention blind faith, helps moves things forward. But I did live up to a few things last year (see [[2001, A Year in Review]]): I spent more time out of the office. Not really getting a life, but it&#8217;s a start.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It doesn&#8217;t take long for me to get back into the swing of (some) things. I&#8217;m already working on trains again. This time, it&#8217;s the locomotive from which I caught the train chasing bug.<br />
I got a call from Don on Saturday, wanting the tapes I shot for 6060&#8217;s trip out to Jasper last year (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]). We chatted briefly, then mentioned that I should drop by the roundhouse at CP&#8217;s Alyth Yard to see 2816 all steamed up. Asking if the engine were heading back to Vancouver for a six-month inspection or more work, Don replied that 2816 was making a run from Calgary to Banff and back with some of CP&#8217;s executives. I was to drop by around 11:00am on Sunday.<br />
When I arrived, Don&#8217;s truck was nowhere in sight. Having never been here before, and coming at Don&#8217;s invitation &#8212; not CP&#8217;s &#8212; I was careful to wait for my escort. Don arrived shortly afterwards, and I followed him in.<br />
2816 was not out in the yard, or even on the turntable (as I&#8217;d hoped). It was tucked inside, the smokebox cover completely removed, the superheater covers removed, and four men milling around inside. Present were Bill (2816&#8217;s lead engineer), Jim (CP employee, RMRS member, and steam locomotive engineer &#8212; Jim had run 6060 to Jasper with us last year), Al Broadfoot (who supervised 2816&#8217;s overhaul), and another man who I&#8217;d never met before.<br />
It seemed that the night before, after Don had left, Bill noticed an odd noise in the smokebox. Upon investigation, he found steam eminating from one of the flue tubes. That could mean only one thing &#8212; a superheater had burst.<br />
We had arrived to find them in the midst of removing superheater tubes. Luckily, they knew exactly which one was giving them trouble, but it was tucked behind a couple of other tubes that needed to be removed first. This involved using an overhead crane for support, and a forklift for leverage. Superheater tubes, especially in larger locomotives, are extremely heavy. Removing them by hand is torture (or so I&#8217;m told by the 6060 crew, who had to do just that).<br />
I didn&#8217;t directly participate. Partly because Bill and Al don&#8217;t know me, but also because I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;ve never seen this done before, let alone participated. I fell into my role of gopher. (Which I&#8217;m quite comfortable at, especially with people who know a lot more than I do.) That basically meant a coffee run.)<br />
While all this was happening, I had long chats with Al. It would appear that my education of Al has been woefully one-sided. I&#8217;ve heard lots of stories and some generally not nice things about him. I&#8217;d always been a little skeptical &#8230; but not enough. Al seems to be a genuinely honest man, trying to keep locomotives in good running shape. This is what I gathered talking to him directly. He actually mourned the RMRS&#8217; lack of a proper shop to maintain 6060. (This is something everyone agrees with.) Needless to say, if for nothing else, I&#8217;m glad I went just so I could talk with Al.<br />
The troubled superheater soon slid out of the boiler. As it popped out and was slowly lowered to the ground, water seeped from the bend. Etched in the forged piece was a tiny hole, about 1/16th of an inch across. Possibly a thin-walled area, aggravated by a grape (a weld that has pooled into a sphere on the inside) causing an eddy, bored right through the side.<br />
Normally, this would sideline a locomotive. But with CP&#8217;s resources, it&#8217;s a matter of cutting off the offending piece and getting in a welder to attach a new bend. Jim knew a good one in town who could come the following day to fix it.<br />
We left 2816 in the roundhouse, covers off, superheaters laid out, awaiting repairs. It almost looked like a patient anxiously awaiting a dentist to fill a cavity. It&#8217;s due to run to Banff (Bamf!) on Friday. I&#8217;m pretty sure it will.</p>
