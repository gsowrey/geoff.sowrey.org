	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The definition of &#8220;patent&#8221;, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#patent">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. U.S. patent grants are effective only within the United States, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions. Under certain circumstances, patent term extensions or adjustments may be available.<br />
The right conferred by the patent grant is, in the language of the statute and of the grant itself, &#8220;the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling&#8221; the invention in the United States or &#8220;importing&#8221; the invention into the United States. What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import, but the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the invention. Once a patent is issued, the patentee must enforce the patent without aid of the USPTO.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s quite a bit more to that definition, but this is as good a place as any to start. Mostly because this is the key point at which the problems seem to start: &#8220;the right to exclude others from [doing anything with] the invention&#8221;. Basically, suing people to ensure that you either get royalties or stop them from doing anything with the invention in question.<br />
And more importantly it is the term &#8220;invention&#8221; that I have issue with.<br />
Lately, it seems that there are a number of companies quite content with registering patents for &#8220;inventions&#8221; that are little more than an extension of logical progression &#8212; something that was bound to come in just a matter of time. But due to the way that American Capitalism works, there is money to be made &#8230; even if you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to get it.<br />
A few people were applauding the USPTO&#8217;s decision to grant a patent on the techniques used to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180206472">implement rich media interfaces on the internet</a> (and pretty much anything that would connect to the internet, including set-top boxes, wireless devices, and the odd refrigerator). This was filed by Balthaser Online, a one-man operation who happened to think of the idea (filing the application for the patent, that is) before anyone else.<br />
Sound familiar? It should &#8212; a similar sort of broad-ranging patent was filed by Eolas Inc. to handle the method in which plug-ins were included in webpages. That&#8217;s a little thorn in the side of the internet that&#8217;s raged for years, now, with pipsqueak Eolas taking on Microsoft Corporation for over US$520 million in compensation.<br />
Compensation for what? For having an idea? Having <em>just</em> an idea? Where the hell is the value in that? Can anyone tell me why on Earth someone should be awarded over half a billion dollars for an idea? Especially if you didn&#8217;t sell it to someone first?<br />
Both Eolas and Balthaser have something in common: they beat someone else to the punch. They filed patents for things that others were thinking of (or would think of shortly thereafter) &#8212; things that others would expand upon and turn into industry standards and solid techniques. In the case of Eolas, the basic idea of including a plug-in was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium and became the de facto way to include items other than HTML into a given webpage. For Balthaser, they&#8217;ve successfully patented a method for using rich media to present an interface. This includes the use of Flash, Flash, AJAX, and XAML. This affects pretty much every aspect of the much lauded Web 2.0.<br />
But where is the <em>innovation</em>? Sure, they beat everyone else to the punch, but what did those companies do to push their &#8220;inventions&#8221; further? From what we can see, all they did was sit around and wait for the USPTO to approve their patents so they could then turn around and license their patent to those who wanted to use the same ideas, or sue those who refused to cough up the dough.<br />
I side with the companies trying to defend themselves against such ridiculousness &#8212; yes, even Microsoft. I want them to win their little spat against Eolas. Tell me that this makes any sense at all. Did Eolas strike out at every browser maker who has ever used a plug-in? They could have gone after Apple and AOL (owners of Safari and Netscape, respectively). Nope. Just Microsoft. Why? Money, what other possible reason could their be? This is the kind of insipidness that comes as a result of allowing patents on broad concepts that are in development in an industry in several places, or already formed and one person happens to patent it first.<br />
Patents weren&#8217;t intended for &#8220;armchair inventors&#8221; &#8212; they were meant for people who wanted to actually do something with it. Look at the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>, the man credited with inventing (and patenting!) vulcanized rubber. This is a guy who wanted to make a difference, someone who had a vision and was willing to follow that vision to the bitter end. And it was a very hard trail &#8212; he and his family lived in poverty (Goodyear himself was in and out of debtor&#8217;s prison) for most of their lives because of Goodyear&#8217;s obsession with creating vulcanized rubber and trying to market his invention. The poor living conditions led to the death of his son.<br />
Goodyear defended himself in court against a wealthy (and unscrupulous) businessman, Horace Day, who had purchased several of Goodyear&#8217;s first run with the invention &#8212; shoes &#8212; to figure out how it was made so he could duplicate the process. The case, known both as &#8220;Goodyear vs. Day&#8221; and the &#8220;India Rubber Case&#8221; is well-known in patent legal precendent for defending an inventor&#8217;s rights to profit from their hard work.<br />
That&#8217;s the key point of patents &#8212; they&#8217;re a defensive measure, not meant to be a weapon against others. That&#8217;s what most of these new patents seem to be &#8212; an effort to scoop cash because someone had the wherewithal to patent a technique that was already well on the way to development, and not even something they were responsible for coming up with.<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the most recent (potential) offender, Balthaser Online. I loathe to immediately label them as the bad guy, but with the awarded patent, it&#8217;s not looking good. Why? Because Neil Balthaser, the former VP of Strategy for Macromedia, filed a patent in 2001 for &#8220;Methods, Systems and Processes for the Design and Creation of Rich-Media Applications via the Internet&#8221;. This was filed when Flash was already in its third version, so it was hardly a new idea. Balthaser just happened to be the first guy in the door.<br />
But maybe I&#8217;m being too harsh. Maybe I&#8217;ve been too jaded with the silliness of the <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=39838&amp;DisplayTab=Article">Eolas vs. Microsoft lawsuit</a> or the utter nonsense of the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1930636,00.asp">NTP vs. RIM lawsuit</a> (I mean, really guys &#8212; are you so callous about money that you&#8217;re willing to cripple communications for hundreds of thousands of people, bringing chaos to the upper echelons of Corporate America?) that I can&#8217;t see anything but ill intent. It&#8217;s possible that Balthaser got the patent to ensure that no-one else did, and will open that patent to everyone thus ensuring that all the developments in the internet since its filing will continue as they should, without impedence or fear that the financial penalty for innovation won&#8217;t prove efforts were for naught.<br />
Having looked at American Capitalism lately, though, I&#8217;m not willing to hold my breath.<br />
The short of this is that the USPTO does not represent the internet. Developments take place in parallel (and often in concert), building on the steps set down by others often not seen until years later (witness the sudden appearance of AJAX, despite the introduction of the core method &#8212; XMLHttpRequest() &#8212; years earlier by Microsoft). Patents filed by those keen only on reaping the rewards of others&#8217; labour serve only to cause problems and financial hardships for those trying to honestly make a difference (and a few bucks, of course).<br />
The USPTO should be restricted to allowing patents where there is proven effort to invent the concept, and <em>continue that innovation</em> to further the idea, market the idea, and do what the giants of the past did &#8212; such as Goodyear &#8212; and <em>earn the right</em> to own that patent. Not just be the first person to put their hand up.<br />
If the change doesn&#8217;t come, maybe I&#8217;ll file a patent for stupidity, so I can sue all the idiots in the world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, 14 February 2006, is being touted as the day people are to <a href="http://actionnetwork.org/sft/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=3738734">&#8220;break-up&#8221; with Google</a> (also <a href="http://noluv4google.com/article.php?id=801">here</a>). They&#8217;re to sever their relationship, their ties, their love for what is still the most dominant search engine on the internet. It might be losing its top place due to a drop in its relevance (word to Google&#8217;s engineers: you guys gotta tighten that baby up &#8212; MSN is beginning to beat you out), but its popularity has never been stronger.<br />
Which is part of the reason why people are trying to punish Google for censoring itself in China. It&#8217;s a backlash against the Big G to try and remind them of their &#8220;do no evil&#8221; mantra.<br />
It&#8217;s about the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard of.<br />
In recorded history, the actions of a group of people have instigated (either directly or as an end result of continued actions) a change in behaviour of an entity, be it the church, a government, or a company. The belief (no matter how ill-thought) is that by removing the traffic from Google&#8217;s engines, people will somehow force Google into removing the censorship in China, allowing the poor, huddled masses there to see all the material currently forbidden by the Chinese government.<br />
The problem isn&#8217;t that Google is censoring &#8212; it&#8217;s that people believe that <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">Google&#8217;s moral direction</a> somehow overrides the legality of operating in another country.<br />
Yes, Google is an American company. It follows all the laws and guidelines set within the United States of America. What most people seem to forget is that just because a company is based there doesn&#8217;t mean that it can behave the same way in every other country on the planet.<br />
The traditional Corporation (we&#8217;ll ignore that the internet exists for a moment) starts in Country A, defined by and operating under the laws that govern that nation. When the Corporation wants to do business in Country B, it can either do so across borders (when it is convenient and relatively painless), or it opens a subsidiary to acclimatize to the different conditions. Every country has a specific set of laws that are almost invariably different (not necessarily hostile towards) to the laws in the originating country. The subsidiary allows the Corporation to function internally with minimal changes, and having the subsidiary deal with the legal specifics.<br />
Even between the United States and Canada, there are legal differences. Although almost economically transparent to one another, there are sufficient differences to require significant treaties to allow the exchange of goods and services (witness the US/Canada Auto Pact or NAFTA). The laws that companies operate within are also different, which leads to having specific subsidiaries in Canada. Even companies like Dell and Microsoft &#8212; and yes, even Google &#8212; have Canadian-specific offices to handle Canadian-specific legal requirements.<br />
When Google wants to do business directly within a country, it needs to open an office. This is particularly important when that country is viewed as being a strong source of revenue. (Yes, folks, this is all due to money. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; or not, money is the root of all evil and money rules everything.) Such is the case with China &#8212; it is the next great revenue source for the search engines. Google just happened to be the first to knock on the door.<br />
China has very specific laws when it comes to information. Such is the reality of living within the confines of a oligarchy-ruled &#8220;communist&#8221; nation. You control the masses (and lest we forget that China has over 1.6 billion people) by controlling information. China allows a great deal of information through its borders (having been there, I&#8217;ve seen what is allowed) and offers its people a great deal of freedom.<br />
But to ensure that its society remains harmonious, there are aspects that are not allowed. Anything to do with democracy, freedom of speech, or anything that might incite revolt against the ruling party is viewed to be particularly dangerous. China has a history of particularly violent civil wars &#8212; even if the ruling party weren&#8217;t trying to save their collective butts, it would be a wise policy to allow gradual change rather than end up with an internal conflict on the order of World War I.<br />
This isn&#8217;t about China&#8217;s policies &#8212; this is about others having to recognize that they exist. Google has, much to the chagrin of others. Google has done what a lot of people now view as a violation of Google&#8217;s moral perogative: censored itself. It has done &#8220;evil&#8221;.<br />
There is an interesting allegory to this. There once was a garden. And in this garden grew a tree. The inhabitants of this garden were told never to eat from the tree. Yet they were inticed by a serpent &#8212; a representation of evil &#8212; to ignore what they were told, and eat the delicious fruit, and ultimately learned the horrible truth.<br />
The story of Adam and Eve is often used as a prime example of evil&#8217;s profits. And yet, if we consider Google to be the tree, for it does contain all the collected knowledge &#8230; who is the snake? It&#8217;s not China, for they want that knowledge to remain in the tree, away from those who would eat the tree&#8217;s fruit. Eating that apple is considered evil.<br />
I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s going to stir a few objections &#8212; how dare I consider the allegory to be even remotely equivalent to a company that chooses to side with an &#8220;evil&#8221; country! Like many things, the concept of &#8220;evil&#8221; is highly subjective. We westerners look down on other nations that do not provide the same notions of freedom. We do not see the same societal constructs that have existed elsewhere for centuries. We consider our enlightenment to be the only true way.<br />
If the recent weeks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy">Muhammad cartoons</a> have not yet taught westerners that absolute belief in our own superiority is a supreme fallacy, I don&#8217;t know what will.<br />
Every company, no matter what medium it exists in or what product or service it offers, must comply with the local laws of the country in which it wishes to do business. For Google to operate in China means it has to contend with the laws that govern China &#8212; that means removing content from their service that are in violation of China&#8217;s information ban. Regardless of how we view China&#8217;s policies, they are what will guide and rule whatever company cares to hang a shingle inside their borders.<br />
Lest we forget, though, it&#8217;s not just China. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1744845,00.asp">Microsoft got slapped by the EU for Windows Media Player.</a> Last time I checked, I didn&#8217;t hear the west complaining about that. In fact, we were encouraging the EU to fine Microsoft and force changes. This was just the EU enforcing the laws they have adopted, for better or for worse.<br />
And it&#8217;s not to say that Google has become wimpy, either. Remember when the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10925344/">White House demanded records on pornography searches</a> on their indexes? Google refused to hand them over. We lauded them for that. But it wasn&#8217;t because they knew they&#8217;d win the hearts of users. It was their policy not to hand over information that was in potential violation of the law. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; includes abiding by the laws they operate under.<br />
Google won&#8217;t be the only one. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/02/12/afx2519826.html">Yahoo&#8217;s following Google to China.</a> And they are also encountering the laws that have given Google so much trouble. The word &#8220;fight&#8221; has shown up, but it&#8217;s not a fight &#8212; it&#8217;s an adaptation. Yahoo, like Google, will need to consider (and probably will end up) censoring its content if it wants to gain the favour needed to earn money behind the Great Wall. And if <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/02/09/china.yahoo.ap/">China asks for information on one of its users</a>, Yahoo will comply.<br />
So perhaps its time for everyone to pull their highly enlightened heads out of the sand and look around. The world doesn&#8217;t end at North America&#8217;s borders. Things are different out there, and companies have to play by different rules if they wish to earn revenue in other nations. And it doesn&#8217;t matter what moral direction that company says it will follow.<br />
The idea here is to pressure China to change its policies by forcing companies to bring in western ideals. This is not a realisitic perspective. Companies will not force changes in an economy the size of China&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not feasible. Companies are too small, too insignficiant. And they know it. Only governments can inflict changes like the ones activists want to see. They want human rights brought in like those in the west. They want Tibet freed. Google can&#8217;t do that. Yahoo can&#8217;t do that.<br />
You want that kind of change? Get your government to change. They&#8217;re the ones who can influence change through trade sanctions, through changes in diplomatic behaviour. Only when political pressure is enacted will it be possible for change to take place. And China&#8217;s considerable economy is tough to overcome.<br />
Don&#8217;t punish Google (or Yahoo, for that matter) for complying with the laws of another country. Talk to your elected official. Lodge your complaints. Make your voice heard by your government. Only through them will the changes you want to see take place.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Y&#8217;know, I used to believe that all the really shady governmental meddling always happened south of the border.<br />
Little did I know that our own government has been setting the stage to run things that we&#8217;d been taking for granted. I caught this first on SlashDot (news for nerds), which directed me to the appropriate article on the Toronto Star website.<br />
It&#8217;s quite freaky, actually. The short version of the story is that <a href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/">Canadian law enforcement wants near-direct access</a> to any information an Telecommunications Service Provider (TSP) might have regarding their users or the information their users transmit over a TSP&#8217;s systems. Without court orders and without having to inform the users. The TSP has no legal recourse but to cough up the goods or face fines and jail time.<br />
Awfully heavy-handed, if you ask me. This is not the usual behaviour of our spend-millions-on-useless-inquests governments. Someone&#8217;s been taking lessons from Uncle Sam.<br />
There&#8217;s a dual impact: not only are our rights to privacy completely ignored (and didn&#8217;t we just <a href="http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/index_e.asp">finish putting in privacy laws</a>?), but there&#8217;s a huge financial cost to the TSPs. Three guesses where that cost will be transferred to? Hello, $50 residential phone service.<br />
But where is this all coming from? The majority of it is the internet, which relies heavily on the TSPs for carrying the signals around the country. The internet scares many people, and it&#8217;s not just the grandmothers of the world who hear about the &#8220;web&#8221; and think of a room full of spiders. It scares legislators because the internet has long been out of the reach of the law.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say people haven&#8217;t tried. Regulation has had some effect in the United States. If you call <a href="http://news.com.com/RIAA+settles+with+12-year-old+girl/2100-1027_3-5073717.html">suing a 12 year-old kid for sharing music</a> files effective, anyway. Here in the Great Not-Quite-White North (all the snow is gone in Calgary), it&#8217;s been hands off. Or so we thought.<br />
It seems the hands were under the table, trying to tap into the phone lines. The government wants to know what we&#8217;re up to. Telephones, email, FTP transmissions, binary streaming data, even VoIP access. And since the internet also runs across cable providers, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if venerable televisions falls under the harsh gaze of the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">RCMP</a>, or even <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">CSIS</a>.<br />
The world changed, and we didn&#8217;t notice. We just went along for the ride. But the fear that the world is running unchecked is worrying some up on Parliament Hill, and they want control. Perhaps not direct control, as in North Korea, but they want to know when we&#8217;re not behaving.<br />
That&#8217;s all fine &#8212; we put governments in place so we don&#8217;t have to deal with the monotony of Big Picture hassles. That&#8217;s what governments do. Did we give them permission to read our emails? Without a court order, I think not.<br />
The legislation currently going through is wide-ranging, and it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty vague. They&#8217;ll be able to define it however they want, and the only victim is every single Canadian who dares to pick up a phone.<br />
I&#8217;m curious to know the underlying reasons. No doubt that fear is an issue &#8212; fear that the government doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on under the covers. Fear that the <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/">CRTC</a> can&#8217;t control what goes on over the internet. Fear that the telecoms might suffer as a result of VoIP.<br />
Technology changes at orders of magnitude faster than anyone in the government can comprehend. By the time you finish reading this, something else big will be on its way. Governments cannot expect to manage something like this without having the capability of understanding it.<br />
Perhaps that means we need a Ministry of Information. Yes, that rings of <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/combined">Brazil</a>, but that&#8217;s not my view. It&#8217;s a place where people can understand the technical infrastructure of Canada. What&#8217;s going on in those phone lines, and what kind of recommendations can be made to make sure that everyone plays nice, and we don&#8217;t impede upon the rights of others. (Like our privacy, for example.)<br />
The world won&#8217;t ever stop changing. That means we need to change. And so does the Government&#8217;s thinking.</p>

		<p>I cannot praise Jeremy Zawodny enough for having posted a very concise POV on <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004373.html">respect for web developers</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re a collection of haphazard Rodney Dangerfields &#8212; we&#8217;re just largely ignored. Web development isn&#8217;t &#8220;cool&#8221;. We don&#8217;t build business apps (though we could), we don&#8217;t deal with databases (though many of us know how), and we don&#8217;t build Flash applications (though some of us <a href="http://www.scottschiller.com/">have the skills to make you think we did</a>).<br />
Yet we&#8217;re the ones who make the pages you see. We&#8217;re the ones who sit down and figure out how to make the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML work together in a choreographed ballet of client-side code.<br />
You might not think about it, but some of those fancy sites you&#8217;ve used (Jeremy mentions a couple of them) are more than meets the eye.<br />
You might not know that we&#8217;re here, but so long as you&#8217;re having a great web experience, you&#8217;re welcome.<br />
Thanks for the notes, Jeremy! I&#8217;m sure there are a lot who appreciate it.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As if it&#8217;s not enough that <a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Google Desktop</a> regularly saves my heiny by finding long-lost files (I mean, really, why is it that Microsoft created two My Documents directories in XP, and then seems to randomly choose between the two?) or digging out an obscure email from Outlook (when you&#8217;ve got 100,000+ messages, a real-time index is a necessity). Last week, Google saved my butt again.<br />
I was meeting up with <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/">Scott</a> after the first day of <a href="http://www.ftponline.com/conferences/webdesignworld/2005/sanfrancisco/">Web Design World</a>, where we&#8217;d go out for something to eat, chat, and catch up. (It&#8217;s been a couple months since he left <a href="http://www.criticalmass.com/">Critical Mass</a> for <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>.) Problem: I knew only one restaurant in all of San Francisco, and it wasn&#8217;t Japanese. Tradition said sushi.<br />
Luckily for me, <a href="http://www.indigirl.com/">Amy</a> knows San Francisco quite well. Or at least, used to. When I called her for a place to go, she couldn&#8217;t remember the name. Only that it was in Japantown, about a five minute drive from my hotel. I had no idea where Japantown was.<br />
She had managed to give me a couple of hints. First, there was a &#8220;roof like a temple&#8221;, and it was near Geary and Fillmore. That was about it. Then, just before I hung up, she blurted out: &#8220;Sushi Buni&#8221;. It was supposedly the oldest sushi boat restaurant in North America.<br />
After the last session of the day, I retreated to my room to wait for Scott (driving in from Sunnyvale takes a while). I dove into <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, looking for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=sushi+buni+san+francisco&amp;038;btnG=Google+Search">sushi buni</a>&#8220;. Nada. I tried &#8220;Japantown&#8221;. Gave me a little info, but nothing concrete enough with which to direct our evening.<br />
I resorted to Google Local, looking for &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/local?sc=1&amp;hl=en&amp;038;q=japanese+restaurant&amp;038;near=94103&amp;038;btnG=Google+Search&amp;038;rl=1">japanese restaurants</a>&#8220;. It gave me a plethora of restaurants, but nothing that seemed to fit the name of &#8220;sushi buni&#8221;. I tried several ZIP codes, each to no avail.<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m a persistent searcher.<br />
I switched to Google Maps, a service that continues to impress me the more I use it. I found <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?q=geary%20and%20fillmore%20san%20francisco&amp;hl=en">Geary and Fillmore</a>, though couldn&#8217;t tell I was around Japantown. This is where Google saved the day.<br />
Just above the map search field is a link to &#8220;Local Search&#8221;. In a much poorer system, this would take you away from the map, and start you afresh. Google has the smarts to know that you just spent a lot of time localizing yourself already, and this is where you want to search.<br />
&#8220;Sushi buni&#8221; still turned up nothing. But &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/maps?q=japanese%20restaurant&amp;spn=0.043640%2C0.061223&amp;038;sll=37.784530%2C-122.432950&amp;038;sspn=0.021820%2C0.030612&amp;038;hl=en">japanese restaurant</a>&#8221; produced a plethora of hits. Still none for &#8220;sushi buni&#8221;. There was one for &#8220;Mifune&#8221;, which seemed to me maybe the place Amy had been suggesting. It was in Japan Center, which she had also mentioned, and seemed like a likely choice.<br />
Scott whipped us over there, and proceeded to investigate Japan Center. It&#8217;s a mall-like edifice with many stores and several restaurants. Part of the complex includes a &#8220;roof like a temple&#8221; &#8212; a small pagoda in the open square on top. We had to be in the right place.<br />
As we walked into the complex, we passed by several stores (all closed) and several restaurants (all open). We found Mifune, but determined that it wasn&#8217;t what we were looking for. Doubling back, we stopped at the only sushi boat restaurant: <a href="http://www.isobune.com/">Isobune</a>. The first sushi boat restaurant in North America. (&#8220;Isobune&#8221; means &#8220;canal boat&#8221;.)<br />
Why didn&#8217;t this show up in the results? Google&#8217;s great, but it&#8217;s far from perfect. The website for Isobune is for the Burlingame location, and not much exists for the Japan Center location. Hence, excluded from the results. Without Google, though, I doubt we&#8217;d have found it.<br />
For the record, Isobune is neat, though the boats move a little too fast, and the J-Pop wears on you after a while. But I was there to visit with Scott. It could have been a Bee-Gees reunion for all I would have cared.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging for a number of years now, going at it hand-to-hand combat style until about a month ago, when I took the bold leap to using <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.<br />
The decision to switch was made for two reasons. First, I was having major problems trying to keep up with the level of content. I was writing entries that were on average 2,000 words a shot (with some up over 10,000). Try writing an essay like that every few days. Sure, you can write about what you know, but it still takes time.<br />
And the content was rarely what I&#8217;ve been wanting to focus on. It was mostly events in my life &#8212; boring and dreary to most. What I was wanting to do more of was the ranting about things that I&#8217;d only had a chance to do once in a while. Such a change requires a complete break from the old.<br />
The second reason for going to WordPress was a desire to get away entirely from the creation and management of files, and more to the creation and management of content. I couldn&#8217;t care less for the structure of the directory system, so long as people are able to find and use the content.<br />
It was about then that I had the epiphany, something echoed by <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> during a conversation we&#8217;d had during our run to lunch at Web Design World, and again in her &#8220;The How and Why of Blogging&#8221; session. So at least I know I&#8217;m not on crack.<br />
Here&#8217;s the simple version: Blogs and CMS (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management systems</a>) have far more in common than people even realize.<br />
Here&#8217;s the more complex version: Blogs are CMS. For those of you who&#8217;ve been using tools such as <a href="http://www.typepad.org/">TypePad</a>, <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, and <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, you already know what I&#8217;m talking about. For the rest of you, there&#8217;s a little something to be learned.<br />
There are three tiers that classify most content management systems. (<a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/ContentManagement/Products/">CMS Watch</a> classifies them as Enterprise, Upper Tier, Mid-Market, Low-Priced, Hosted, and Open Source.) Many in the CMS field generally ignore the blog software as being too much of a point solution to do anything particularly useful.<br />
The Tier 1 systems are the 800 pound gorillas of the industry. They include <a href="http://www.vignette.com/">Vignette</a>, <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/">Interwoven</a>, and <a href="http://www.documentum.com/">Documentum</a>. Licences start at US$300k and go up &#8230; fast. Unless you&#8217;re dealing with huge amounts of content and have staff whose sole responsibility is the creation and maintenance of that content, chances are this is something you can skip right over.<br />
Divisions between Tier 2 and 3 I don&#8217;t fully understand, nor do I pretend to. I&#8217;ve read materials and talked with representatives from companies that place their products in both categories, but the product set isn&#8217;t comparable. Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/cmserver/default.aspx">Content Management Server</a> seems to usually fall into Tier 2, as does <a href="http://www.hotbanana.com/">Hot Banana</a>. Yet Hot Banana is very close to <a href="http://www.marqui.com/">Marqui</a>, which seems to be Tier 3. Not to mention the near-countless other applications that get thrown into the mix.<br />
What about blogs? Tier 4, if such a thing exists. I don&#8217;t put them in the same class for one basic reason: a lack of workflow. Blogs are meant to post information, though they&#8217;re often personal in nature. In a proper CMS, there is an approval process, where the creator is rarely the one who approves the final version for public consumption. In a blog, the author is also the approver.<br />
Aside from that key distinction, the two systems are very similar: an interface for handling content, a repository for storing that content, and a mechanism for retrieving that content. Vastly simplified, blogs and Tier 1 systems are almost the same.<br />
And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ll stop the comparison. Because blogs are not Tier 1, nor will they ever be. If WordPress (my blog engine) were to move to that level of functionality, it would cease to be blog software, and become something else. And it&#8217;s the simple nature that makes blogging not only attractive, but powerful.<br />
For large corporations, blogs are a novelty. Even though <a href="http://fastlane.gmblogs.com/">GM</a> and <a href="http://www.boeing.com/randy/">Boeing</a> have high-profile blogs by high-ranking executives, they are marketing tools. Smaller companies, though, could take advantage of the simpler nature of the blog tools by using them to publish their websites.<br />
The benefits are clear: centralized data management, simple interfaces, control over presentation, easy setup and maintenance, and next to no cost. Forget the US$300k licence fee: WordPress is free. You pay for the bandwidth.<br />
Versioning? No. Approval chain? Uh uh. Editorial control? Only if you show the content to an editor first. Does a small company or organization even need all that, though? Chances are, not. Most small institutions have simple needs, nothing even remotely close to what Tier 1, 2, or 3 systems provide.<br />
The next wave of CMS is just about to roll in: blogs as a serious content management system. You won&#8217;t just see it sending out interesting comments. You&#8217;ll see it managing content in small, simple, and highly effective ways. Those who master the blog CMS will find site updates much easier, and will adapt to changing business requirements much more readily.<br />
If you are a solutions provider looking to help a client with CMS, consider your friendly neighbourhood blog. You might be surprised what you can do.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Many years ago, I was turned onto <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a>. Admittedly, without a full understanding of why. At the time, I was hardly in a place to object or complain, and did as I was told.<br />
In the years since then, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate the reasons: cleaner, tighter code; better compliancy with standards; better semantics; and most importantly, separation of structure and presentation.<br />
One of the things that XHTML does well is drop support for presentational tags, such as <code>bold</code>, <code>italics</code>, and my personal favourite, <code>font</code> among many. Okay, yes, technically they&#8217;re still in the XHTML 1.0 specification, but they&#8217;ve been deprecated. That&#8217;s enough for me to call them unsupported.<br />
Right now, the <code><br />
</code> tag is still supported, being wholly valid. For the last few years, I&#8217;ve sat on the fence with what to do with it. According to the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a>, who defines this stuff, it&#8217;s good. So if I&#8217;m to follow the rules, I would allow use of <code>br</code>.<br />
After today&#8217;s session in &#8220;HTML to XHTML&#8221; (with <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly</a>), I had a bit of a revelation that really sealed the deal for me. As much as others love <code>br</code> for solving problems, there is really no reason to use <code>br</code>, except for legacy reasons. Otherwise, I think it&#8217;s time for <code>br</code> to be retired from the active tag list.<br />
What was the revelation? Show me the semantic meaning. Every &#8220;good&#8221; tag in XHTML has semantic meaning, offering more to the structure of the page than the content it contains. For example, <code>p</code> is a paragraph &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing else it could be. <code>br</code> is a line break &#8212; a <em>presentational</em> construct, nothing else. There&#8217;s nothing else it could be.<br />
Now I know that argument isn&#8217;t wholly suitable. Under that same argument, <code /></p>
<div>would be removed from the list as well -- it doesn't offer any semantic meaning, as it is just a block-level element for breaking up the document. The same goes for .So maybe it's more than that. Maybe we need to consider tags in terms of semantics and document construction. That would allow most tags, with three exceptions:  <code>br</code>, object tags (<code>object</code>, <code>embed</code>, <code>img</code>), and <code>hr</code>.<br />
The object tags we have to allow -- they're partly presentational, but they do include content. Naturally, this means an extension of supported tags to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic</li>
<li>Document construction</li>
<li>Content objects</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I just seem to be finding ways to avoid including <code>br</code>. To a degree, I am, mostly because I want to see its use terminated. I know there are proponents out there who still think <code>br</code> has value. However, in places where you need a line break, it is usually because of formatting.<br />
CSS handles the formatting now -- there's no reason to insert a tag to handle that aspect. So what if you need to create a series of individual lines, like with a poem? <code>br</code> would be perfect for that. That might be a reason for a specific XHTML structure, as that kind of content would require different semantics than regular structures (such as paragraphs).<br />
Mind you, this also brings <code>hr</code> into question. Like <code>br</code>, this seems to serve only a presentational purpose. Yes, you can style it through CSS, even make it disappear. What is its purpose from a semantic perspective?<br />
So <code>br</code> is finally off my "supported list" (just gimme a while to modify the WordPress template to remove it from the rendered code), only to be replaced by <code>hr</code>. Any votes with what to do with it?</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Speaking of bugging, I ran into <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly</a> again as I left <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Dave Bowman</a>&#8216;s presentation for lunch. (I swear Molly, I wasn&#8217;t waiting in ambush for you!) I had meant to ask her this question before Dave&#8217;s presentation, but we broke off as not to miss too much.<br />
Some time ago, Scott had the luxury of seeing a presentation by Molly and <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>. He wrote about a quote they&#8217;d read off:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re writing HTML like it&#8217;s 1993, you&#8217;re doing your job.<br />
<cite>Eric Meyer and Molly Holzschlag</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Molly had read [[Writing HTML like it&#8217;s 1993|my blog entry]] about it, noting that I&#8217;d &#8220;taken them to task&#8221; over the idea. Admittedly, I felt a little low &#8212; who am I to be slagging two of the major standards gurus? I never meant to sound like that! But I can certainly see why I could be coming across as, well, an ass.<br />
The issue I had with the quote is that I don&#8217;t want people, especially folks who are trying to encourage others to develop in a certain way or who have previously used tools and are now hand-coding, to do things the wrong way.<br />
For the record, and this was straight from Molly&#8217;s mouth, the idea of writing HTML like it&#8217;s 1993 is more of a joke than a suggestion. The core idea, however, is still correct: write a document as it was meant to be written. Don&#8217;t try to infuse layout or presentation into something that shouldn&#8217;t have it.<br />
That&#8217;s the problem with a lot of so-called developers out there. They create documents laden with reams of presentation that does nothing for layout, confuses search engines, ruins accessibility, and ultimately causes problems for users (although it&#8217;s easy to argue that it shouldn&#8217;t). If you reset the clock to an earlier period, before all of this garbage was even possible, there is hope.<br />
That spawned off a long conversation about backgrounds, blogging, and education as a necessity within our field as we waited for lunch. Like I said, Molly&#8217;s a great person to talk to. If you ever get a chance to meet her, I highly recommend it.<br />
And sorry, Molly, for sounding like a jerk. At least you know now where I was coming from.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When someone decides to stay away from a defined direction, ignoring both precendence and the collective good, they are considered to have gone rogue.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, bastion of monopolistic behaviour in the software world, is known for being somewhat rogue. They defend themselves by saying they&#8217;re blazing new paths. This time, they&#8217;ve gone too far.<br />
Internet Explorer 6 was released in October, 2001 to much fanfare. The hope was that IE 6 would be the one to correct the errors in IE 5.x, some of which were horrible. Sadly, IE 6 failed to live to many expectations, and the web development world would have to wait until future browsers (such as <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a>) to find stronger support.<br />
In the last year, we&#8217;ve seen the release of Firefox, and it&#8217;s been good. We have much better (though still not perfect) CSS support. This has allowed us to start thinking about ditching the older code bases and concentrate on the standard development practices we want to use.<br />
Microsoft has allowed <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer</a> to wane, following up only with security updates, and no new version to correct the errors of yore. Naturally, the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">news that IE 7 (aka &#8220;Rincon&#8221;) is coming down the tracks</a> has been met with a great deal of interest&#8230;<br />
&#8230;and a little too much dismay. It appears that despite all the progress towards supporting <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/">CSS Level 2</a>, Microsoft might decide <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1776290,00.asp?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">not to completely support</a> it.<br />
This little statement has left a lot of us scratching our heads. Why the heck not?! You&#8217;ve got more than enough time to get it right (correction: you&#8217;ve <strong>had</strong> more than enough time), you&#8217;ve got a strong development team, and for crying out loud, you helped <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/members.php3">define the freaking standard</a> in the first place!<br />
(For the record, Microsoft is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">member</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>, and Microsoft employee and web development guru <a href="http://www.tantek.com/">Tantek Ã‡elik</a> was one of the editors for CSS Level 2.)<br />
Let&#8217;s not forget that CSS 2.1 has been around for over a year, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/">CSS 2.0</a> was released in May, 1998.<br />
Is it really that hard to implement standards correctly?<br />
The single biggest fear I have is that they&#8217;ll release another browser that requires another set of esoteric hacks to get layouts to work properly because Microsoft refuses to follow the CSS specification properly. Sure, they fixed the <a href="http://www.redmelon.net/tstme/box_model/">box model</a>, but that&#8217;s basic-level stuff. Relative layouts introduce a whole new world of pain.<br />
As a web developer, I don&#8217;t want to see any hacks at all. I want something that is clean, something that interprets CSS the same way as Firefox, <a href="http://http/www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a>. They&#8217;re compliant. Why can&#8217;t IE be the same way.<br />
Throw in your proprietary extensions. Go nuts. I&#8217;m sure someone will find them handy. But for the love of all things standard, can you please support the existing specification properly? And in its entirety?<br />
(Oh, and would it behoove you to throw in even just a little <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">CSS 3</a> so we can start using that, too?)<br />
In the meantime, <a href="http://people.opera.com/howcome/">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie</a>  and the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> have announced <a href="http://news.com.com/The+Acid2+challenge+to+Microsoft/2010-1032_3-5618723.html?tag=nefd.ac">Acid2</a> to help push Microsoft to do the right thing. The rest of us in the Web Development biz should unite behind them and help.<br />
[Update: 18 March]<br />
An interesting little note came up on <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1776935,00.asp">Microsoft Watch</a>. It seems that a few insiders claim that CSS 2 is &#8220;flawed&#8221;, though they fail to indicate how. As CSS 2.1 is still only a candidate recommendation, Microsoft seems keen to continue on its merry way and do what it wants to.<br />
Just a thought on that, Microsoft&#8230; Netscape tried that once with Netscape 4. Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to elaborate.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I read a lot of <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/03/ajax_promise_or.html">blogs</a>. It&#8217;s about the best way I have of keeping up with the trends in the industry. But there&#8217;s one trend out there that&#8217;s really beginning to bother me. A lot.<br />
<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s an acronym/abbreviation for &#8220;Asynchronous Javascript with XML&#8221;. It&#8217;s this supposedly wonderful technique that solves a wonderful array of problems by introducing XML into advanced Javascript methods.<br />
News flash, folks, this ain&#8217;t new. This has been around since <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/02/09/xml-http-request.html">XMLHTTPRequest</a> was introduced with IE 5.0 in March, 1999. (It&#8217;s still not officially standardized by anyone, especially the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA</a>, who until now has kept up with the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-262.htm">specification of the scripting language</a> we generally call &#8220;Javascript&#8221;.) Despite being available for so long, no-one really put it to use until Google slapped in place for <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a>. Suddenly, everyone took notice.<br />
Apparently, having read around a little more about Ajax, I&#8217;ve come to a conclusion that I don&#8217;t intend to ever use &#8220;Ajax&#8221;. I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://www.forgetfoo.com/?p=2&amp;blogid=2965">XMLHTTPRequest</a> when needed, and I&#8217;ll make a point of using advanced Javascript, again when needed. But I won&#8217;t use &#8220;Ajax&#8221;. Because as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it doesn&#8217;t exist.<br />
Okay, yes, it&#8217;s a catchy name &#8212; that I won&#8217;t deny. But is it worthy of the recognition? Hmm&#8230; well, maybe just a little. Enough that it attracts attention and gets people to think about techniques they might not have previously considered. In a way &#8220;Ajax&#8221; will serve the same purpose &#8220;DHTML&#8221; once did.<br />
For those of you newer to the field, &#8220;DHTML&#8221; isn&#8217;t a technology. In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHTML">DHTML</a> mirrors Ajax in many ways. It&#8217;s a technique, and the parts aren&#8217;t all required. DHTML was a marketing gimmick Microsoft came up with to sell the blending of HTML, CSS, and JScript (remember, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t acknowledge Java at all). The idea was that this powerful &#8220;new&#8221; technology would solve a lot of problems.<br />
When DHTML was first proposed, it caught a lot of buzz in the field. And rightfully so, because at the time, most people were mired in <font> tags, bgcolor attributes, and tables for layout. DHTML would solve those woes and turn people towards the standards they were supposed to use.<br />
It&#8217;s odd that Microsoft would be the one to drive many towards standards, especially since they didn&#8217;t formalize any of them. (Though Microsoft did come up with a lot of the ideas that are now the standards .) And change we did, though not entirely to Microsoft&#8217;s urging &#8212; we also have the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> and their efforts to thank.<br />
The effect, however, will likely be the same. Ajax will direct those who&#8217;d never really thought past simple image replacement scripts to now think about making their sites more functional and more engaging than ever before. XML isn&#8217;t a requirement, but it is a convenient part of making it all work. In time, Ajax will likely serve the same purpose DHTML did.<br />
Okay, so maybe I&#8217;ve been a little too harsh. Ajax does serve a purpose. And it will continue to be talked about. I just hope the discussion is intelligent and comprehensible. I want the people reading about Ajax to understand that it is not a silver bullet, and what exactly Ajax does and how they can use it.<br />
Mostly because I&#8217;m sick of seeing &#8220;DHTML&#8221; on resumes, and I&#8217;m not keen to see &#8220;Ajax&#8221; show up there with the same level of ignorance.</p>
