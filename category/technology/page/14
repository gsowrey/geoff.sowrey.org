		<p>For the last week or so, my computer hasn&#8217;t been cooperating completely. Internet Explorer would suddenly cause the hard drive to chew away as it tried to start a JavaScript method of some kind. Then it wouldn&#8217;t run at all, crashing almost as soon as I tried to start it. Even loading email was difficult.<br />
Thankfully I know a few things about computers (especially the piece of garbage known as &#8220;Windows&#8221;) so was able to poke around and figure out what was going on. Well, <em>try</em> and figure out what was going on.<br />
A low-level disk scan revealed a number of bad clusters. They happen from time to time, usually as a result of shutting down a computer in the middle of an I/O write. One or two is not unexpected. Ten or more is a problem. Which is exactly what I found &#8212; about 15 of them. That struck me as being &#8220;bad&#8221;.<br />
It struck me as being more than just software at issue. It sounded like hardware. It sounded like a drive failure.<br />
I dislike jumping to the worst-case scenario when it comes to strange things on computer. I know there are a million things that could potentially go wrong before things go <em>really</em> wrong. But I seem to have almost a sixth sense for stuff like this.<br />
I first noticed it when I worked at Ark Computers back in high school. Back then, I was installing and supporting RLL and MFM hard drives. 30 megabytes. Big stuff for that time. Loud, too. Installing them meant using an obscure debug command to open the low-level formatter before you could even think about using fdisk to set up the drive. (I screwed up one of the original IDE drives because I low-level formatted it by accident.)<br />
Customers would bring their computers in thinking they weren&#8217;t behaving correctly, and I could tell just by listening that something was wrong. Generally, I was right, too. I could hear sounds that just &#8220;didn&#8217;t sound right&#8221;. It freaked out Rob, my boss. He couldn&#8217;t figure out how I did it. But I was right every time. Backed up the hard drive. Turned the computer off. Boom. Dead drive.<br />
I thought that years of not longer doing hardware support would dull and eventually kill the experience. Little did I know that it would remain. I was validated when just afternoon, I got the call: the hard drive needed to be replaced. It&#8217;s amazing how happy I was about the fact that my hard drive was dying. (Thankfully, not dead.)<br />
The bad part: It took me almost four hours to restore my files and settings from the old hard drive to the new. I&#8217;m going to be configuring this lousy thing for weeks to come&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It seems a lot of people (especially those at Microsoft) are constantly extolling all the virtues of the next Microsoft operating system to-be, Windows Vista.<br />
Am I really the only person who sees it as a dinosaur?<br />
Admittedly, I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of Microsoft software. I&#8217;ve dealt with Microsoft for far too long to trust pretty much anything they release. I have struggled with each and every piece of software they have ever released.<br />
Well, save for one: DOS.<br />
Mind you, operating systems were a lot simpler back then. They didn&#8217;t need to do much. They just needed to provide an environment in which things would work. But the problems with Vista started even back then. Remember the 640k barrier? The workarounds to use the higher memory?<br />
I&#8217;ll wager that the roots of DOS are still there. Sure, they rewrote the whole thing for Windows NT. But have you ever wondered why the requirements for the operating system keep getting larger and larger? Why you need more and more disk space to run it all? Windows XP is supposedly based on Windows NT (as was Server 2003), and I wonder how well all the changes are managed.<br />
It&#8217;s an operating system. It&#8217;s supposed to support everything else, not set an initial barrier to entry! There have been press releases about how powerful hardware needs to be in order to get the best experience out of Windows Vista. Any system bought within the last year is likely outta luck &#8212; you don&#8217;t have the juice. That just strikes me either as gloriously poor support for the user, or collusion with hardware vendors. Since when do you need a graphics accelerator to view a Word document?<br />
Okay, I exaggerate &#8212; it will run sans 64 MB of RAM on your video card &#8212; but the statement still seems to baffle the mind. Does Microsoft not think that perhaps there is need to rewrite from the ground up?<br />
Take the most successful operating system in recent years: UNIX. Not just Linux, but also Mac OSX. The kernel is small. No graphics. It runs. Add on only what you need to make things work. It runs nicely. There are releases of Linux out there that at a glance look like Microsoft Windows. Mac OSX is based (loosely) on the Mach kernel from the vaunted (and lamented) NeXTStep operating system. There&#8217;s a reason Macs run sooooo nicely, and it ain&#8217;t just the hardware.<br />
C&#8217;mon, Microsoft, if you hope to compete on the desktop space, you need to think much more carefully about your foundation. Crappy foundations lead to crappy experiences.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve used video conferencing before. It was a novelty. Nothing fancy. There, but didn&#8217;t think much of it.<br />
Until today.<br />
Critical Mass recently got a Polycom video conferencing unit in the Calgary office. (There are matching units in Chicago and Toronto.) We&#8217;ve started using it with my current client for the weekly status meetings.<br />
The client is in Geneva. The video conference makes them seem like they&#8217;re in the same room.<br />
It&#8217;s trippy. It&#8217;s not the best quality and the lag is a little weird, but you get to see everything. Every facial movement (well, that the resolution lets you see, anyway), the mannerisms, everything. And because you can see yourself, it&#8217;s also makes you very self-conscious. Also trippy.<br />
Our client is eight time zones and over 12 hours of flying away. And our one hour of overlap a day keeps us somehow connected over a simple IP-based video connection.<br />
Technology really does make a difference at times.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Sigh.</em><br />
Just when I thought <a href="http://www.decloak.com/Dev/CSSTables/CSS_Tables_01.aspx">this topic was in the past</a>, to be revisited in the same manner as when historians look at how the Black Plague ravaged Europe. But no, it&#8217;s back. I&#8217;ve had to don my somewhat dusty Web Practice Lead hat at Critical Mass to once again defend the faith from tyranny and the inequities of evil men. (Sorry, sudden <em>Pulp Fiction</em> flashback.) That should read to defend against ignorance. But I digress&#8230;<br />
There has been a slight push in the industry over the last few months to return to using tables for web page layouts, rather than the industry standard CSS presentation. Keeping our finger on the pulse of the industry, many of us at Critical Mass have seen the arguments. Some even begin to question our own direction.<br />
This is a good thing, by the way. I want those questions. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> once said, the most dangerous phrase in the language is: &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it this way.&#8221; Bring the arguments. Bring the discussion. Just come armed and educated.<br />
The movement back to tables is an uneducated position. Despite all the arguments for the movement, the one thing it seems to be ignoring is why the W3C standards exist. They&#8217;re not there because a few people thought it was a good idea. They&#8217;re there because a group of people far more educated than I spent the time to figure out what the best method would be.<br />
Yes, CSS is complicated. I will completely agree that in many ways, CSS is far too cumbersome for most developers. I will be among the first to stand up and say that support is not complete and correct. I&#8217;ll gladly point fingers at Microsoft&#8217;s regular aberrant behaviour. CSS is not perfect, and anyone who uses it with any depth will come to realize that there are issues with CSS&#8217;s specification (never mind the often haphazard way the browsers implement the specification).<br />
BUT<br />
Critical Mass does not represent most developers. We have gone beyond what most developers contend with. Our interfaces are richer and more engaging than the majority of designs out there. We deal with clients who expect results better than middle-of-the-road, and that&#8217;s what will drive us to use the right technology for the right reasons.<br />
As strange as it sounds, we work towards segregation: separation of content, presentation, functionality, and structure. This isn&#8217;t just the W3C standard &#8212; this is common sense. Anyone striving to do proper development, in <em>any</em> language, should be doing this. If you tie the structure to presentation, you&#8217;re going to have a fun time making edits when that presentation changes. I&#8217;ve seen this happen hundreds of times before. Veterans in this industry can tell you horror stories of having to change the structure of a website across a thousand files, a tedious task that took weeks. Yes, this can be automated, but the connection is the point &#8212; it should <strong>never</strong> occur.<br />
In this article, they split CSS into CSS and CSS-P. This is an interesting, albeit incorrect direction. Critical Mass (as well as most decent developers) adhere to CSS 2.1, which doesn&#8217;t break down into two parts. It&#8217;s <strong>one</strong> standard that happens to cover the appearance of fonts and colours, and handle the layout of a page. And that&#8217;s what people need to understand.<br />
This requires an understanding of CSS beyond how to use CSS for fonts. From a hiring perspective, we do require that all new hires have an understanding of CSS. While we do not require skills along the lines of Jason Santa Maria, Dave Shea, or Dan Cederholm, although it&#8217;s very cool when someone comes in the door who writes great CSS. We do want to see people laying out pages in CSS, even if it&#8217;s rudimentary and potentially awkward. Only with that understanding can people learn.<br />
When people cry that &#8220;tables are the only way to go&#8221; for websites, they have given up on the standards and all the benefits that come along with them. They have opted to cut themselves short on skills and knowledge and allow the site to suffer long-term. I cannot accept that anyone would willingly throw in the towel to lose out on the flexibility of using CSS over the rigidity of tables.<br />
Arguments such as speed, ROI, tables already being in databases, and standards that are too heavy are grossly uninformed. Speed is pointless because any sufficiently complicated design will necessarily have a sufficiently complicated table &#8212; and that&#8217;s easily larger than using CSS because you have to download the table on every single page. CSS downloads once. ROI is self-defeating because most people only look at the development phase and neglect the far more costly maintenance phase. Well-developed CSS will always allow for faster (hence, cheaper) maintenance. Yes, tables are in a database &#8230; and if that&#8217;s your argument, you&#8217;ve completely misunderstood the need to separate systems. And that&#8217;s not a discussion I&#8217;m getting into now.<br />
It&#8217;s the flexibility that we want. CSS can change quickly (assuming you&#8217;ve architected your CSS appropriately) and the same structure can be reformatted with many CSS files. I challenge anyone to show me how to do CSS Zen Garden in tables. And remember, any sufficiently powerful tool is by its own nature more complicated &#8212; simple isn&#8217;t always better.<br />
All of that said, I do have a concession&#8230;<br />
Despite the need to follow standards (knowing why we use them), there is an overriding condition that we must be aware of at all times: We have to follow budgets. And if something is too difficult to do in CSS, we will build it with tables.<br />
Though I will immediately point out (should this condition arise) that if you are going to tables because it won&#8217;t work with CSS, that I would question the reasons why. If it&#8217;s an infamiliarity with the technology, then more practice might be required. Or that the CSS is already too complex, and there&#8217;s a cascade problem. Specificity is important, and the key is to know when to use global settings and when to use specific references.<br />
And of course, we should ALWAYS use tables for tabular data. But you already know that.<br />
So why is this coming up? Why is there the movement back? In a word: AJAX (oh, how I hate that acronym). The last time we had a major buzzword in the Web Development field, it was DHTML. It&#8217;s equally as annoying as AJAX because it caused everyone to think a new technology existed. (In both cases, it&#8217;s just promoting something that already exists in a novel way.) The buzz has had a positive spin, forcing a lot of previously less-skilled developers to need to learn the standards to implement AJAX correctly. The speed at which people have had to learn is a concern, and those having trouble with CSS are running back to tables.<br />
To those people: slow down. Don&#8217;t panic. The solution is there, you just need to spend some time and play a bit with CSS. Maybe you need to do it at home. If you think CSS isn&#8217;t worth the time and effort, you really need to think about how you&#8217;re approaching your project. I know from my own experience that tables are a dead-end. And if you talk to the best developers in the field, tables are <em>only</em> good for presenting tabular data. Long live CSS.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been using PC-based computers for 25 years. A quarter-century. And things have come such a long distance since I first sat in front of that IBM in Mom&#8217;s office. This has all come to light as a result of an article I came across in <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,1-c,systems/article.html">PC World about the 25 Top PC Computers</a>, as a way of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first IBM PC.<br />
I had been introduced to computers at an early age &#8212; the Commodore PET and the Apple II in the late 1970s. Several friends had Commodore VIC-20s and 64s. The concept of computers was hardly unfamiliar, but the matte beige and grey box before me was &#8230; unusual.<br />
First off, it was big. Really big. Most of the computers I&#8217;d seen at that point (save for the PET) were little more than keyboards, visually-speaking. This had a keyboard, a monitor, and a big, strange box that you had to turn on and off. By today&#8217;s standards, it was little more than a glorified calculator:</p>
<ul>
<li>IBM Personal Computer, Model 5150</li>
<li>4.77 MHz Intel 8088 Microprocessor</li>
<li>Green monochrome monitor, text-only</li>
<li>128k RAM</li>
<li>2 x 360k single-sided 5.25&#8243; disk drives</li>
<li>Wide carriage Epson 9-pin dot matrix printer</li>
</ul>
<p>For the record, it wasn&#8217;t <em>my</em> computer. It was owned by my mom&#8217;s employer, who wanted her to use it for bookkeeping. But the PeachTree software she had to use was so cumbersome and difficult that the computer gathered dust for the longest time until I got around to using it. It wasn&#8217;t the easiest computer to use, either. You had to boot off of floppy disks, and regularly had to change disks to load software. Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to flip the disks over, as some systems required back then.<br />
I taught myself DOS 1.1, which was the only operating system I had. BASICA (BASIC Advanced) was also provided in a separate manual (though the program was on the DOS disk). I read the manual, looked at the sample programs, and taught myself BASIC. I wrote a number of programs, including what could technically qualify as a database (long before I knew what a database was). It stored all the statistics of my Transformers.<br />
I used the system for years, writing my essays on an early version of WordStar, but I couldn&#8217;t really do a whole lot. Without any graphics to speak of, I was always behind my friends who were playing &#8220;Impossible Mission&#8221;.<br />
Curiousity, a common thread through my life, got the better of me and I pulled the cover off one day. Inside was a mess of stuff that made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. I didn&#8217;t know what a single thing was in there, except the obvious stuff (power supply and disk drives).<br />
One summer, my dad got me a job working as a general labourer in the shop at his company. In the office was a IBM PS/2. It had a 30 MB hard drive, which I&#8217;d never encountered before. Despite some mocking by the other guys in the shop (they&#8217;d mash on the keyboards and claim they were &#8220;computer experts&#8221;), I learned how to create and manage directories. Which prepared me for my next computer.<br />
Convincing my parents to do this wasn&#8217;t easy, but they eventually gave in and bought me my high school computer science teacher&#8217;s old IBM-compatible XT computer. Faster than the IBM, and had four different colours to use! Most importantly, it had a hard drive. A huge one, by the standards of the day, and I was able to start doing more advanced things, playing actual games, and seeing pictures (sort of).<br />
Before too long, the lack of colour got to me and I really needed to get something better. A new video card, with a whopping 256 colours! So I went downtown to a place called Ark Computer Systems and bought myself a handy video card which I was told &#8220;should work&#8221;. It would seem that the trusty XT was too old. The card wouldn&#8217;t work. Admittedly, my computer diagnostic skills were fairly weak at the time, so I was hardly an expert at fixing it. I went back to the store to see if they could help. Ultimately, I needed a more expensive card because it overrode the computer&#8217;s BIOS with its own to provide the video. I had more colour!<br />
And little did I know, I also had a reputation. When I entered the co-operative education program in Grade 12, the school arranged an interview for me with a local computer company. Ark Computer Systems. When I walked into the store for my job interview, I was told: &#8220;Take the tie off, the job&#8217;s yours.&#8221; That day I was installing an RLL hard drive using the low-level formatter built into the hard drive controller, accessible using a little-known debug command. (IDE drives, which came a couple of years later, took all the fun out of having to do the grunt work to set up hard drives.)<br />
Over the next couple of years, I came to be the primary tech, fixing virtually everything and anything that came into the store. I got so good at one point that I could tell when a hard drive was about to fail just by listening to it. I couldn&#8217;t sell computers worth a damn, but fixing them wasn&#8217;t a problem.<br />
I ended up with a 386SX from there &#8212; a prototype that we&#8217;d gotten in to try and win a large contract with an agency of some kind. 16-bit colour, an 80 MB hard drive, and a whopping 8 MB of RAM. (Hey, it was the late 1980s &#8212; I was pushing boundaries with that!)<br />
All that experience landed me a co-op job with Digital Equipment Corporation (formerly the #2 computer company after IBM, now a forgotten memory bought up by Compaq and pretty much disassembled), doing user support. The money paid for university and my next computer: a 486 tower. My first CD-ROM drive. A 100 MB Seagate Barracuda SCSI hard drive (which failed a few years later, much to my chagrin).<br />
I worked at a computer store in my last year of university, earning enough to pay rent and food. I worked there a bit too much though, burning out in my final months. Another computer here, a first-generation Penitum. More RAM, more disk space.<br />
My first job in Toronto put me working a lot of hours, partly because I didn&#8217;t know any better and was determined to prove myself. To whom, I don&#8217;t know, but it still made me work a lot. And it led me to the worst computer purchase I&#8217;ve ever made: a Gateway Solo 2100. Boat anchor. I spent almost as much time talking with Gateway tech support to get the stupid thing fixed as I did using it. Ironically enough, I still have the thing (a 66 MHz Pentium). I have no idea why.<br />
Radical Entertainment was a great place for hardware. One advantage of being a videogame company: you get all the latest hardware to play around with. My actual work computer was okay (a Dell, as I recall), but the latest AMD systems were on a test bench. My job: get the latest and greatest for the developers to play with. We drooled over AMD K7 chip. We could literally feel the power when we turned it on.<br />
I&#8217;ve gone through a number of computers since then: one at home and three at the office. My current system is a Dell Lattitude D620. If this sucker existed 25 years ago, I&#8217;m sure it would have put my friends on their fancy Commodore 64s into apopelptic shock. Dual core Penitum 2.4 GHz with 2 GB of RAM and a 80 GB hard drive, full 32-bit colour with dual monitor support, wireless internet connectivity, and a DVD-RW drive.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how much computers have changed over the last 25 years. And Moore&#8217;s Law is still holding out, despite a lot of belief that eventually it&#8217;ll have to finally give out. Given that 25 years ago we couldn&#8217;t imagine the computers we&#8217;d have today, it&#8217;s hard to imagine what we&#8217;ll see 25 years from now.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The [[Layered Interfaces: Setting the Stage|previous article introduced the idea of creating layers]] when building a website. It&#8217;s not a new concept &#8212; similar ideas have existed in computer science for decades. Even in terms of web development, the ideas are not unfamiliar. But in terms of specifics &#8212; <em>how and why</em> the layers are put together &#8212; the ideas are still developing.<br />
This part of the discussion focuses on the technical aspects of layering &#8212; what needs to happen for everything to work properly, and in what order. The components of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flash are key concerns.</p>
<h3>Structure is Important</h3>
<p>HTML is far from dead. HTML is the start of a website, the structure that defines the context of individual pages, of entire websites, and of the World Wide Web itself (for it defines the links that bind it all together). It is greatly misunderstood and maligned for perceived shortcomings. It is viewed as basic, minimalistic, and incapable of growth beyond its core definitions. Ironically enougn, it is because of its minimalistic purpose that HTML (and it&#8217;s successor, XHTML) that we can form the basics of a website.<br />
For the sake of simplicity, I&#8217;m going to use just the term &#8220;HTML&#8221; from here on. Assume that where I&#8217;ve written &#8220;HTML&#8221;, you can also write &#8220;XHTML&#8221;.<br />
Structure provides context. Text on a page is merely text. But with context, text is organized into elements that can be used for a variety of needs. The structure feeds into (almost) every aspect and layer of a website. At its most basic level, structure allows search engines to derive headings, lists, paragraphs, links, and meta data so they can categorize the text. Both search engines and screen readers use the structure context to know what they are reading.<br />
But structure lends its hand to other parts of webpage construction. CSS connects to the HTML structure to create layout (from basic to full). JavaScript connects to IDs and elements in the structure to enable functionality. The same structural context can be read by Flash components to create layouts and elements needed to make a functional interface. HTML needs to form the basis of every single webpage, no matter the final presentation layer.</p>
<h3>Componentized HTML</h3>
<p>HTML should be written to be componentized: where individual sections of a page might be identified and modified (either through CSS or JavaScript) in successive layers. This requires the proper use of IDs and classes, and ensuring that enough structure has been added to allow individual sections to be manipulated without modify adjacent sections as well.<br />
I&#8217;m not going to write up a sample HTML to illustrate my point &#8230; because there&#8217;s one handily present: just <a href="/index.php/2006/05/27/layered-interfaces-getting-technical/">view the source of this page</a>.<br />
Each page on this site has a specific structure, looking something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>container
<ul>
<li>header</li>
<li>wrapper
<ul>
<li>nav</li>
<li>content</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>menu
<ul>
<li>main</li>
<li>sub</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>footer</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It might seem like a waste to have such a high-level item such as &#8220;container&#8221;. What does it do? Why not bump everything else up a level? If you want a really good reason why something like this has value, you only need see the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>. One structure, a thousand designs. The principle isn&#8217;t so much for contextualization as it is flexibility with document presentation. You could do without it, but its presence is beneficial and doesn&#8217;t take away from the technical implementation. The same principle applies with the subsections, such as &#8220;wrapper&#8221; and &#8220;menu&#8221;.</p>
<h3>The Basics of Presentation</h3>
<p>So your HTML structure is set, eh? Great, now you can move onto the next layer of your presentation: Minimal layout. This is meant to support earlier users that do not have an adequate understanding of CSS. This implies CSS 1.0, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>font definition (for all headers, paragraphs, lists, links, etc.)</li>
<li>some colour definition (primarily for text, but some other elements are also supported in CSS 1.0)</li>
<li>minimialistic layout (width and height)</li>
</ul>
<p>Specific layout, referring to the positioning of elements on a page, is left for the Full Layout step.<br />
The basic presentation is to provide an elegant degradable experience for those with inadequate support. Through basic support, without customization for specific (e.g. mobile) users. Similarly, basic presentation should avoid cross-browser issues inasmuch as possible. Cross-browser issues tend to arise with higher-level abilities such as positioning, which are beyond the context of basic needs.<br />
The basic CSS should be contained in a single file, <strong>base.css</strong>, loaded using a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element in HTML. Basic presentation can be enhanced and/or overridden by successive CSS files as needed. Most known agents support loading with a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element:<br />
<code><br />
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" xhref="/styles/base.css" type="text/css" /&gt;<br />
</code><br />
Care needs to be taken that these definitions are readily accessible for use in Flash. As Flash does not yet support CSS positioning, it is important that fonts and colours carry into Flash as readily as they in the Minimal Layout layer.<br />
Now I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Am I truly suggesting maintaining <em>TWO</em> CSS files for a site? One with minimal layout, and one with complete layout?<br />
Yes and no. First off, you can quite easily take your final CSS and cut it down so it&#8217;s just the minimal layout that&#8217;ll be supported in CSS 1.0 without difficulty (you might need to make some minor edits to accomodate for things like minimized attributes). With luck, you won&#8217;t need to modify your Minimal Layout very often, as it&#8217;s &#8230; well &#8230; minimal.<br />
However, two files might not actually be enough. Especially when you&#8217;re dealing with a development team where several people might be editing the presentation. But that&#8217;s a discussion for&#8230;</p>
<h3>Taking Position</h3>
<p>With the basic presentation in place, we can look to enhancing the basic definitions with those needed for the Full Layout experience. As mentioned in [[Layered Interfaces: Setting the Stage]], support should only be for those browsers capable of handling CSS 2.1. (The list of suggested browsers is also provided in Part 1.) Although support could certainly be added for other browsers in the list, additional work will often be required to overcome compatibility issues present in those agents.<br />
Right off the top, we can cut out the browsers that don&#8217;t support CSS 2.1 by including CSS 2.1 instructions using the <code>@import</code> directive:<br />
<code><br />
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;<br />
@import url("/styles/global.css");<br />
&lt;/style&gt;<br />
</code><br />
(As a point of note, do not try to restrict yourself to a single CSS 2.1 file. Large sites might require multiple files to adequately support presentation initiatives.)<br />
One flawed technique to &#8220;detect&#8221; browsers is to use CSS hacks &#8212; exploiting the differences between the browsers&#8217; capability to parse CSS. A simple intentional mistyping of CSS instructions can cause some browsers to skip over (or specifically target) specific instructions. This is an actively discouraged technique, as browser vendors tend to correct the parsing inconsistencies with successive updates, requiring active monitoring of the hacks.<br />
The only hack I particularly like &#8212; only because it&#8217;s actually safe to use &#8212; is one that hides CSS from Internet Explorer on the Mac. This now-dead product hasn&#8217;t died away yet, and is notoriously incompatible with CSS written for other browsers. A simple edit to the <code>@import</code> block does away with this rather troublesome browser:<br />
<code><br />
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;<br />
/* import stylesheets and hide from ie/mac \*/<br />
@import url("/styles/global.css");<br />
/* end import/hide */<br />
&lt;/style&gt;<br />
</code><br />
(Thanks to <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/03/16/arkanoid.html">Dan Cederholm</a> for that little trick.)<br />
Preferred methods include using <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html">JavaScript detection and loading</a>, using third party applications (such as <a href="http://www.cyscape.com/">BrowserHawk</a>), or methods internal to the browser (such as Internet Explorer). These each have the drawbacks, however, and are not always ideally suited to the general task. JavaScript detection is the most flexible, but can require significant maintenance. Third party applications can be expensive and often require annual licensing. <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html">Internet Explorer&#8217;s internal detection</a> works only for Internet Explorer browsers.<br />
No matter the specific method, the concept is the same: detect the specific browser and load a specific CSS file to compensate. This process should only be carried out in cases where it is necessary &#8212; CSS must be kept simple and maintainable.</p>
<h3>Function after Form</h3>
<p>With the layout all in place, it is possible to move to adding additional functionality. JavaScript is best used when the layout has been set in place (or at least well-established). Not all websites require additional functionality &#8212; this site, for example, has almost none. In fact, the only functionality that plays well to the user experience is a JavaScript method that opens the current year in the Journals section. There are other methods, but they do not add any benefit to the user (it&#8217;s all reporting information).<br />
JavaScript should always be invisible to the user. In the past, developers often embedded large blocks of JavaScript directly in the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> blocks in HTML, and even inlined with the code. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to see image rollover code in links containing the image in question. (I&#8217;ll freely admit being guilty of all of this, incidentally.) Those were the old days &#8230; these days, we know better.<br />
JavaScript should never be directly inserted in HTML unless 100% unavoidable. Acceptable exceptions include code required to support reporting tools such as Omniture, which requires a JavaScript variable to be set per-page. Yes, you could manage these in external files, but the benefit is lower than putting it in the page itself.<br />
Scripts should initialize through the <code>document.onload()</code> event whenever possible (some scripts do need to run during page load) to minimize interference. The obvious question is how &#8212; there&#8217;s only one event, so how do you initialize a dozen objects? Attach a method to <code>document.onload()</code> that performs an <code>eval()</code> on an array of methods you need to run. Simply add them to the global-defined array as the scripts are loaded, and they&#8217;ll be executed automatically.<br />
It&#8217;s important to note this process of initializing objects on document load. Because no elements in the HTML have any inline JavaScript, you need to make sure that the objects can &#8220;see&#8221; the JavaScript. Some browsers &#8212; Internet Explorer most notoriously &#8212; does not see objects properly until the page has finished loading (and the <code>document.onload()</code> event fires). That&#8217;s when additional functionality can be added to the page. This can extend to rollovers, menu flyouts, animations, or windowing events &#8212; anything you can think of.<br />
Let&#8217;s take the windowing event as an example. If you view the source of this page, you&#8217;ll see <code>onclick="window.open(this.href);return false"</code> in all of the <code>&lt;a href...%gt;</code> entries that go off-site. This is to open a new window without fear that users with disabled JavaScript won&#8217;t be able to navigate. That&#8217;s the key thing to focus on &#8212; users (and that includes search engines!) that do not parse JavaScript and therefore do not gain any additional functionality from it. Your website should be usable with JavaScript turned off.<br />
Anyway, to my point &#8212; my site still has inline JavaScript, for the simple reason that I just haven&#8217;t had time to do anything about it yet. What I should have is an additional marker in my HTML: <code>rel="ext"</code>. Innocuous. But a JavaScript method can easily find these entries in <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, and append a DOM event to open a window if a user clicks on the link.<br />
Another example: Image galleries. (Yes, mine needs a lot of work. I know.) Don&#8217;t load more than one image. Don&#8217;t even throw in any additional linkage if you don&#8217;t have to. Load it all through JavaScript. Attach DOM objects and methods to allow better image viewing without overloading the HTML with functional equivalents. A perfect example of this sort of idea handled beautifully is <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/">Lokesh Dhakar&#8217;s Lightbox</a> library.<br />
Why extract it like this? Standards aside, there is one major reason to do so: maintenance. You can either maintain a single method that makes the call, or track down potentially thousands of instances in your HTML. You do the math&#8230;<br />
I suppose I should throw in the obligatory AJAX comment here, too. (I hate the term &#8220;AJAX&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s far too misleading. But it&#8217;s also what everyone seems to know.) The same thing applies for advanced functionality &#8212; the client-server stuff I mentioned back in [[Layered Interfaces: Setting the Stage]]: keep it separate, keep your site safe.</p>
<h3>Enriching the Experience</h3>
<p>So you&#8217;ve built your website completely standards-compliant. Everything is wonderful. You rank high in search engines. Everyone raves about your killer Web 2.0 application.<br />
But your boss comes up and says: &#8220;It&#8217;s fine and all &#8230; but we want to use Flash.&#8221;<br />
Once you&#8217;ve managed to refrain from displaying your boss&#8217; head on a pike, relax &#8212; it&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. Your hard work isn&#8217;t going to waste, and your website is not going to lose any of its technical integrity. But it will require some forethought about your website architecture and construction to make sure your Flash layer works properly.<br />
Here&#8217;s one of the oddest secrets in the industry: Flash and HTML work very well together. So well, in fact, that you can use the HTML layer to help push content to Flash &#8212; then use CSS to help set some of the formatting, and repurpose the JavaScript functionality. Flash can load HTML as readily as it can load XML &#8212; and you don&#8217;t have to parse parameters to extract content and context. It&#8217;s already all there for you! Applying CSS is almost simplistic.<br />
Okay, I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself. I keep forgetting Flash 10 isn&#8217;t out yet. Sadly, this is the future and not the present. The reality is that Flash is <em>grossly</em> lacking HTML and CSS support. It&#8217;s not nearly as good as it needs to be. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you still can&#8217;t integrate the two. You just need an intermediary: XML.<br />
We need not to think of Flash so much as a stand-alone application or a separate website onto its own, but being a part of the existing website. Flash should be layered on the very top, like adding whipped cream and a cherry to the top of your sundae &#8212; in enchances the flavour and texture of the ice cream, but doesn&#8217;t replace it. Like whipped cream, Flash is rich and offers a lot. And like too much whipped cream, too much Flash can ruin an experience.<br />
Think of the functionality that cannot be performed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (a combination popularized as &#8220;DHTML&#8221;). This is where you start with Flash. Immersive functionality, blended audio and video, engaging animations &#8212; these are Flash&#8217;s hallmarks, and where it excels. These hallmarks are content; more importantly, they are <em>additional</em> content to the core content of the website (found nestled in the HTML structure). They need to be blended with the existing core content to produce the final result.<br />
There is also the question of the Flash experience. In the standard HTTP paradigm, a request for a new page enacts a page reload &#8212; the existing page disappears and is replaced with a new page of content. Flash is not bound by this paradigm (neither is AJAX content, mind you), and there is no reason we should enforce the paradigm just because we&#8217;re making Flash a layer in our website. We should enable Flash to work with the website, but simultaneously not bind it to the website&#8217;s restrictions. We&#8217;ll do that in two steps.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Building the Flash Layer</h4>
<p>Your Flash layer should be mostly empty, containing no core content. Content should be read in from an outside source to minimize maintenance. (Less material that requires editing for content changes, and the same layer can be used for multiple languages.) The Flash layer needs to be aware of the page structure so content can be easily loaded. Being able to read the CSS to set up simple formatting is also key for maintenance, but should not constrained to positioning &#8212; remember, Flash cannot understand CSS 2.1 &#8230; yet.<br />
By the way, don&#8217;t even think about doing any of this in any version prior to Flash 8.<br />
In your JavaScript functionality, there should be a detection script that determines if the user has a compatible version of Flash. If so, load the Flash layer. When the Flash layer loads, it should read the HTML of the page to populate the core content. The Flash layer should have modules that key into the page structure, providing the additional content (for animations, audio, and so forth).</p>
<h4>Step 2: Bridging the Webpage Gap</h4>
<p>Once Flash is loaded, there is absolutely no reason why Flash should perform like a non-Flash webpage. Put in transitions, allow animations, bring content in and out at will &#8212; break the traditional &#8220;page&#8221; paradigm! You&#8217;ve got access to all the content you need already, you just need to structure it accordingly. Oh! How about that &#8212; we already gave it structure. Convenient, non?<br />
When the HTML structure is loaded into Flash, it also includes all the links you need to go from page to page. When a user clicks on a link to load a new batch of content, all you need to do is unload the content of the current &#8220;page&#8221; and load the new &#8220;page&#8221; content from HTML, and combine with the appropriate Flash modules. The user remains in a Flash environment, all the while seeing the new content. The bridge, when completed, should look something like this:<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/flash.gif"><img width="200" title="Feeding Flash with HTML" src="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/flash.gif" /></a><br />
HTML pages need to load from one page to the next. Once in Flash, however, you can stay in Flash and just load the HTML content.<br />
Why would you do all this? There&#8217;s a wide range of reasons, but let&#8217;s start with some of the biggest:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility</strong>. Flash is accessible, but it requires a lot of extra work to make it truly accessible. When users who require accessible websites come to yours, they might not see the Flash &#8230; but their screen readers will see the wonderfully-written HTML that conforms to Section 508 and the WAI.</li>
<li><strong>Users who can&#8217;t see Flash</strong>. Yes, Flash has a high-90s percentage for penetration. (According to its completely unbiased creator.) But there are those users who can&#8217;t see Flash. And those who can&#8217;t see the most recent versions of Flash because they do not have the ability to upgrade &#8212; their systems are under administrative lockdown. Don&#8217;t cut them out of the experience.</li>
<li><strong>Users who don&#8217;t have JavaScript enabled</strong>. Depending on which statistic you see, there&#8217;s 2-5% of users who have JavaScript disabled for security reasons. No Flash. But basic site functionality? No problem&#8230;</li>
<li><strong>Search engines</strong>. Leave the best for last. Yes, Flash is readable by search engines. But Flash&#8217;s indexability is horrible &#8212; none of the content is contextual, so the search engines cannot weigh or rank items the same way they can index HTML. So let the HTML stand for the search engines, and make sure your Flash can load from specific pages. Voila! Deep linking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8230; that doesn&#8217;t cover everything. And you&#8217;d be right. There is one major issue in Flash that still needs to be addressed. The dreaded browser back button.<br />
This is not impossible, and you don&#8217;t need to use framesets. You do need to use a frame of somekind, however. Luckily for us, the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is available, doesn&#8217;t break any standards, and can remain hidden. It doesn&#8217;t interfere with search engines, and functions as the window to the history layer, allowing for back button&#8217;s functionality. As the saying goes &#8212; where there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way! For a great example of how this works, check out <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/beta/">Yahoo! Maps Beta</a>.<br />
One final note to mention with regards to Flash and working with existing structure and functionality of a website: You can use <a href="http://weblogs.macromedia.com/mesh/archives/2005/10/video_of_kevin.cfm">Flash with AJAX</a>, too &#8212; specifically using Flex 2. Just in case that&#8217;s of any interest&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Websites are a hugely powerful information medium &#8212; they can entertain, endorse, educate, even drive a sale. But only if they engage. These are basic elements for anyone in the interactive marketing. Without them, websites are little more than electronic brochures, offering nothing new to anyone reading them.<br />
The web/interactive industry has placed a lot of emphasis on the overused (and insufficiently understood) buzzwords <acronym title="Asynchronous Javascript And XML"><a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a></acronym> and <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a>. (The articles linked are the seminal sources of the two trends.) Buzz though they may be, they refer to the increasing demand on websites to produce interactive experiences that go beyond simple pages with forms, links, and copy.<br />
(Under the &#8220;definition&#8221; of Web 2.0, there is much more than interactivity. Community is a significant aspect of Web 2.0&#8217;s direction. This article is concerned with the interface &#8212; the <em>interactivity</em> &#8212; of a given website. The more advanced aspects of Web 2.0 are left for future discussions.)<br />
Website development (not necessarily the <em>technical</em> development &#8212; this applies to the overall process), however, often neglects to view websites holistically. The prime offender is when Flash is rolled into the mix, and the project branches into two entirely separate streams. The Flash stream takes on a life of its own, and the other stream often withers away as a result of resource division (and diversion). Given the interactive and accessible requirements of a website project, this is recipe for failure.<br />
What makes a successful website? It&#8217;s not just budget adherence and customer satisfaction. Does the project meet is requirements? Is it accessible to the planned audience? Does it deliver the message regardless of how the user interacts with the site?</p>
<h3>Thinking About Users</h3>
<p>Users aren&#8217;t always people. We tend to always think about users in human terms. Ultimately, websites are designed for humans, but the number of users goes beyond the human element. No two users of a website are the same. Some users are high-end computers with every possible option in its best possible configuration &#8212; they can get the full experience with no complaint. On the opposite end of the scale are automated users that read content in sites and follow links, such as search engine spiders.<br />
A user is any device that will access and process the instructions of a website. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the user is high-end, low-end, or any point in between &#8212; there should be no difference in importance between users. All are valid, all have something to contribute or gain from a website, and you cannot profile which of those users will have the greatest impact on a website&#8217;s success.<br />
Every user agent that can access the internet reads a website&#8217;s structure and the content it contains: the browsers (IE, Firefox, Netscape, etc.); search engines (Google, Yahoo!, MSN, etc.); cellphones, PDAs, and other mobile devices; even the odd refrigerator. All have different requirements and needs &#8212; but we can account for them all by thinking of our websites in a different way.<br />
Funny thing about those users, though: you can put them in a line and list in order from needing the least support to the most support. In effect, creating a baseline and stating the interfaces than can be layered upon it, including incremental layers for those users in the middle ground.</p>
<h3>Building Websites in Layers</h3>
<p>At their most basic level, websites offer information. How that information appears to a person viewing the site is where things get interesting. In the past, we have viewed only small aspects of a site, namely the ultimate deliverable: how it appears. The implementation comes as a second thought. That secondary focus introduces a lack of focus on the overall solution &#8212; not by necessity, but by side effect. The goal is to view the entire solution and refocus the view.<br />
Websites aren&#8217;t a single deliverable &#8212; they&#8217;re a result of four aspects: content, structure, functionality, and presentation. Each of these aspects contain specific elements that deliver the end result. Some refer specifically to the content, some to the technology. Years of design development have standardized both content and structure. They are well known and understood. Due to the ever-changing nature of technology and the desire to create even more immersive experiences, the definitions of functionality and presentation are in near-constant evolution and have a wider range of definition.<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/aspects.gif"><img width="200" title="Aspects of website components" src="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/aspects.gif" /></a><br />
Content is mostly text, images, and video, feeding into structure: HTML or XML. Application logic and databases are fed by (and feed) HTML and XML. HTML and XML feed into functionality: Flash and AJAX, which unite functionality and presentation. HTML also feeds into CSS.<br />
Fortunately, we can account for the changing nature by building on what is well understood, layering on successive abilities much as you would add slices to a layer cake. It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s plain HTML, HTML with CSS, AJAX, or Flash &#8212; it&#8217;s all layers of functionality and presentation.<br />
We used to talk of building &#8220;HTML sites&#8221; or &#8220;Flash sites&#8221;. In &#8220;Flash sites&#8221;, HTML is regarded as little more than for launch pages. The danger in thinking that we should separate HTML and Flash in this way is that we lose a major avenue for reaching an audience. Content is locked in Flash, cutting accessibility for some users, such as mobile devices, search engines, and screen readers. We don&#8217;t need a different paradigm &#8212; just add a new paradigm to see things in a different way. Going forward, we should consider HTML and Flash two be layers of the <em>same</em> website.<br />
First, a redefinition of presentation. Typically, presentation is the last of the four aspects, and deals with the final appearance of a given webpage. &#8220;Presentation&#8221; covered everything that was past showing just the &#8220;raw&#8221; rendered HTML. But presentation shouldn&#8217;t be so broadly defined when taken in context with the user spectrum. Presentation can mean different things to those users, especially in how we can target the final view that they can see. So in addition to considering a spectrum of users, we need to consider a spectrum of presentations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unformatted HTML</li>
<li>HTML with Minimal Layout</li>
<li>HTML with Full Layout</li>
<li>HTML with Full Layout and Client Functionality</li>
<li>HTML with Full Layout and Client/Server Functionality</li>
<li>HTML layered with Rich Media</li>
</ol>
<p>These are <em>considerations</em>, not requirements. While putting all of these into a final website would be ideal, it&#8217;s often too cost-prohibitive to do so, and there might not be any real benefit. Budget limitations will also constrain the list those that will produce the best return on investment (CSS 1.0 support isn&#8217;t really necessary if you&#8217;re not working on PDAs or cellphones, or worrying about browsers released prior to 2002). For the purposes of discussion, we won&#8217;t worry about costs or limitations.<br />
Consider the spectrum of presentations to be cumulative &#8212; each successive layer builds on the former, and parts of each aspect feed in to successive aspects. Thus each successive layer adds additional features and abilities not present in previous layers.<br />
<a href="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/layers.gif"><img width="200" title="Aspects of website components" src="http://www.sowrey.org/images/soapbox/layers.gif" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Content (text, images, and video) feeds every layer.</li>
<li>HTML (as structure) feeds into every layer.</li>
<li>CSS feeds into every layer except unformatted HTML.</li>
<li>JavaScript feeds into the client and client/server layers, and forms some basis for the Rich Media layer.</li>
<li>Flash feeds only into the Rich Media layer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unformatted HTML</h4>
<p>This is as it sounds &#8212; the rendered HTML, sans any form of formatting (beyond what the browsers apply natively). It&#8217;s the simplest way of presenting a website, but you&#8217;re left to the whims of the user reading the information. (Remember, a user in this case is not a person, but generally software.)<br />
This option is important to note for one particular reason: there are users that don&#8217;t care about what the website actually looks like. They&#8217;re concerned only with the content that appears in them: primarily text and images. It&#8217;s not just search engines, though (we&#8217;ll ignore the fact that they often do &#8220;snapshots&#8221; of a website&#8217;s homepage that does include the presentation) &#8212; think of software to support disabled persons. Users such as that parse only the structure to obtain the correct order for reading out content.</p>
<h4>HTML with Minimal Layout</h4>
<p>Older browsers and mobile devices (cell phones and PDAs), among a few types of users, are limited in their ability to process layout. This is sometimes due to using technology based on older standards, or due to perceived limitations of the specific medium.<br />
In cases such as these, &#8220;layout&#8221; is subjective &#8212; there is little positioning of elements on the page. Due to the level of technology, the majority of support is for basic colour, font definitions, and some minor formatting. This level of support is ideal for the minimalistic agents, which do not require much formatting to present an adequate user interface.</p>
<h4>HTML with Full Layout</h4>
<p>Full layout &#8212; a complete presentation of a design &#8212; is the basis for the goal of a website. It defines the interface parameters and the basic interactive ability. Ultimately full layout defines the branding for the website.<br />
Full layout is generally only supported with the most recent browser set, ones that fully support W3C standards (the stand standards that allow full layout). Very few browsers are considered to be fully-compliant, as according to the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/acid2/">Acid2 test</a>, so even the most recent browsers have some incompatibilities with the expected result. Full layout-capable browsers include (but are not necessarily limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer (Windows platform only)
<ul>
<li>5.5 (some incompatibilities)</li>
<li>6.0 (minor incompatibilities)</li>
<li>7.0 (soon-to-be released, unknown incompatibilities)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Safari (Mac OS X platform only)
<ul>
<li>1.2 (minor incompatibilities)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mozilla-class (Windows and Mac platforms; UNIX platforms by implication)
<ul>
<li>Firefox 1.x (some minor incompatibilities)</li>
<li>Netscape 7.x (minor compatibilities)</li>
<li>Netscape 8.0 (minor compatibilities)</li>
<li>Camino 1.x (Mac only)</li>
<li>Mozilla 1.7+ (minor incompatitibilies)</li>
<li>AOL 7.0 (some incompatibilities due to additional AOL interface)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Opera (Windows and Mac platforms; UNIX platforms by implication; unknown support in mobile-supported Opera browsers)
<ul>
<li>7.x (some incompatibilities)</li>
<li>8.x (minor incompatibilities)</li>
<li>9.x (currently in beta; possible full support)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these browsers should be directly supported in active development of a website. There is a cost consideration for support, due to the inconsistencies across browsers. Although these inconsistencies are considerly fewer than in previous browser generations (notably the differences between Netscape 4.x and Internet Explorer 4.x), they still incur additional time and effort to correct. As such, we should always conduct a proper profile of client websites before recommending a supported browser set.</p>
<h4>HTML with Full Layout and Client Functionality</h4>
<p>A &#8220;flat&#8221; layout fulfills most of the needs of a website. Additional functionality is sometimes required to meet specific needs. Examples include simple form validation, drop-down menus, and even animations.<br />
This functionality is restricted to the client &#8212; to the browser. Whatever functionality that occurs does so with the browser&#8217;s context. The goal is to add some additional ability to a website, either to enhance someone&#8217;s interaction with a website or to provide a better overall experience. It should be noted, however, that this functionality might not actually benefit all <em>users</em>, since they do not interpret or process all client-side functionality.<br />
From this point forward, the additional layers cease to have effect for all users. Only the higher-end users that can make full use of the layer&#8217;s ability will see a difference. Lower-end users (such as search engines) do not gain anything additional from the layers as they do not interpret that layer&#8217;s additional information.</p>
<h4>HTML with Full Layout and Client/Server Functionality</h4>
<p>The next layer extends functionality past the browser to connect with a server. This allows data interchange beyond the normal HTTP client/server paradigm. (This refers to the normal page request/reload behaviour.)<br />
As a result of bypassing the normal client/server behaviour, we can introduce additional functionality to allow people to interact with server-maintained information and data. Such response times are often very low when compared to page reload, and without the actual page reload occuring, the overall experience with the site is greatly enhanced.</p>
<h4>HTML layered with Rich Media</h4>
<p>Rich media is often viewed as the ultimate way of presenting a website, sometimes at the expense of other requirements. When this happens, the rich media aspect can take on a life of its own, and it loses focus on the holistic requirements of the website. But these are issues with creation and management of rich media &#8212; the layer itself is still of benefit.<br />
Rich media &#8212; such as Flash &#8212; can add a very powerful interactive layer to a website, providing additional functionality combined with strong visuals. The key to the successful use of rich media is to enhance the existing content, functionality, and presentation through the medium&#8217;s abilities &#8212; not to present a dramatically different approach to the presentation.</p>

The CCAT &#8212; the <a href="http://www.ccat.org/">Calgary Council for Advanced Technology</a> &#8212; conducts regular meetings. What exactly this group does, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. But they do seem to arrange for an interesting networking opportunity.<br />
Originally, I wasn&#8217;t really interested. Jim sort of goaded me into it, though. Aside from the fact that it was Google, it seemed like getting an entire table of us (eight, in total) would be possible &#8230; but only if I went. I figured, if nothing else, a change to see what else Google had up their sleeves might be something worth seeing.<br />
The night started off at the Telus Convention Centre (lower level of the Glenbow Museum, to be specific), in what I can only describe as the largest networking scene I&#8217;ve yet seen in Calgary. I was hardly a shining example, focusing mostly with Rob (a former co-worker), Mark (from the Green Party of Canada), and a guy who specialized in PDA solutions. Hugh (whose name was recorded as &#8220;High&#8221;) scored about at least a dozen cards in the time we were there. There&#8217;s a man I need to learn a lot more from when it comes to meeting new people!<br />
Table 20 was just us: Dave, Ryan, Allard, Nichole, Chantelle, Jim, Hugh, and myself. Ryan and I ended up with our backs to the stage, where Wendy Muller of Google would speak later on. Until then it was a variety of speakers from around the Calgary community. The only good one (I think) was the CEO of West Canadian, George Brookman. He had a calm, easy demeanour (and apparently knew most of the people in the room &#8212; including the mayor) and leapt into a speech that sounded completely off-the-cuff, and yet completely practiced.<br />
Sadly, he would remain the best speaker of the night. The president of the CCAT read his script, and didn&#8217;t sound at all at ease in front of the room. Normally, the uneasiness should pass in a couple of minutes (or so I&#8217;ve read). Normally.<br />
The keynote was Wendy Muller, the VP of Marketing for Google Canada. She&#8217;s been in the marketing industry for a couple of decades and seems to know her stuff. A couple of things were clear, however, during the course of her speech. First, as much as others look to Wendy to be the &#8220;voice&#8221; of Google Canada, Wendy doesn&#8217;t understand her field.<br />
She&#8217;s been at Google for four years. But she doesn&#8217;t get the point. She doesn&#8217;t get the technology. She&#8217;s an old-school marketer. She knows the way things used to be done. The new way still seems to escape her, however. The presentation was short, and the Q&amp;A period even shorter. Questions were often specific, but Wendy either hasn&#8217;t learned how to divert the answer (the two most common responses were &#8220;no comment&#8221; owing to specific internal situations; or a very long-winded answer, signifying nothing, ending with &#8220;does that answer your question?&#8221;).<br />
And like the president who introduced her, she read her presentation, too. I&#8217;m no speaking guru, but even I know that you should practice your presentation. Make it sound good. Go over it again and again and again until you know it so well that you don&#8217;t need your notes. You should only glance at the presentation to make sure you&#8217;re covering all the points that are there. If you&#8217;re reading the points in their entirety rather than using them as a summary &#8230; might as well email the bugger to everyone on the list and save them the hour.<br />
Well, the meal was pretty good. So perhaps it was ultimately worth it. Even if I didn&#8217;t win the iPod up for grabs.<br />
I think Wendy needs to attend one of the major Search Engine Strategy conferences, and get to see how others present from her company. There&#8217;s a wad of Googlers who are lower-rung than her, and present a lot better. Wendy didn&#8217;t really say anything that I didn&#8217;t already know to some extent (clarification on statistics notwithstanding). And I doubt that I&#8217;m the only one thinking that.</p>
