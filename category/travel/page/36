	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to three deafening pounds on the bedroom door. Cathy had arrived at the Sowrey homestead, and wasn&#8217;t going to wait for her poor brother (and future sister-in-law) to adjust to the time change. She wanted to start up to the cottage, and she wasn&#8217;t keen on waiting.<br />
The cottage? Cathy&#8217;s significant other (more than a boyfriend, but not quite a husband) owns a cottage just outside of Huntsville. (Huntsville, for those of you without a map, is about 250 kms north of Toronto.) Huntsville&#8217;s claim to fame, aside from being a nice little town, is bringing Shania Twain to the world. She got her start at the Deerhurst Resort, which sits on the eastern edge of town.<br />
Allison and I weren&#8217;t off and running with the bulls that morning, it took us a while to get going. There was a reason for this, of course &#8212; we needed to make a phone call. What&#8217;s so special about that? Well, for one thing, it was to British Columbia, three hours behind Ontario. For another, it would settle our problem with finding a new apartment.<br />
Finally sick to death of the apartment we&#8217;re currently in (lots of noise, endless renovation, and I&#8217;m getting tired of the commute), we started looking for a new place to live. Because of the way our lease is structured, we had to hand in our notice to vacate one month and one day before our last day &#8212; September 30. This was long before we had a place settled.<br />
We had searched high and low through Kitsilano and the West End to find a place. We found a few promising ones, but nothing definite. We were getting a bit uptight about finding an apartment in time before we left for Ontario. Then, on the Tuesday before, we went to see a place in the West End. It sounded promising: Two bedrooms, balcony, view, and a dishwasher. The dishwasher was a big thing for us &#8212; we&#8217;re sick of having our counter space sucked up with a dish rack.<br />
When we arrived, there were several people directly on our heels. It was only because I thought we should get there early that we got there first. Allison whispered in my ear &#8220;we&#8217;ll take it&#8221; after only barely stepping into the apartment. But we had to wait for the manager to show the apartment to two more groups.<br />
The next group bribed her $100 to give the place to them over us. The second group offered $250 more per month. (There were two more groups from Toronto who both offered $350 more than the advertised rent.) I began to understand why prices out here were so out of whack. (In retrospect, Toronto has caught up in the Rent Race as of late.)<br />
We were told that we would find out Thursday morning if we got the apartment. When Thursday morning came, Allison (who accepted the call) discovered that the owner of the apartment (apparently it&#8217;s a condo) was concerned that Allison is self-employed. We&#8217;d expected to run into this problem &#8230; when we bought a house, not renting an apartment. Allison hastily faxed nearly every quasi-financial document that proved she was trustworthy.<br />
The call Friday morning would tell us either A) we got it, or B) we&#8217;d be apartment hunting as soon as we got back. We were hoping it wasn&#8217;t B).<br />
I dialled the management, and asked for Dana, the woman we had been dealing with. (Interesting fact: Almost every single building manager I&#8217;ve dealt with since I got here has been a woman &#8212; only one man.) Her response was: &#8220;Are you ready to sign the contract that says you&#8217;ll take me for two weeks of the year?&#8221;<br />
This is Dana&#8217;s little joke &#8212; she thinks the view at our new apartment is great, and joked that she would like to stay there two weeks of the year when she&#8217;s retired. It&#8217;s harmless &#8230; I hope.<br />
So that brings me to a new point: Our new address information. You might want to jot this down&#8230;<br />
[Information not available on the web. Sorry&#8230;]<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
The whole famn damily (as my dad would say) was going to up to the cottage. Allison and I would pick up my sister, and my parents would drive up in the RoadTrek. We&#8217;d meet either in Huntsville, or at Weber&#8217;s (if we got there at the same time).<br />
Following the simple directions, Allison and I arrived at my sister&#8217;s house. Yes, house. She owns a house with Craig (hence the more-than-boyfriend, not-quite-husband designation). It&#8217;s a nice place, it just needs a little bit of work to make it their own &#8212; they&#8217;ve only been there a couple of months.<br />
And off we went. I drove for the first bit, about 80% of the trip. This took us north of Toronto, through Barrie and Orillia, and finally to Weber&#8217;s, home of the best burgers in Ontario (and possibly the world). As we blitzed north, we passed my parents, who then engaged in a game of &#8220;keep up with the children&#8221;. We met for lunch.<br />
Weber&#8217;s is a landmark in the Muskokas. Everyone travelling north of Orillia on Highway 11 knows about Weber&#8217;s. You can&#8217;t miss it. It&#8217;s the only hamburger joint with it&#8217;s own bridge across the highway (the bridge is the only privately-owned bridge (or walkway) across a highway in Canada &#8212; bought from the CN Tower in the early 80&#8217;s). They serve up to over 110,000 people in one month (up to over 6,000 in one day).<br />
Yes, they&#8217;re *that* good. That&#8217;s why the bridge is there &#8212; to get the southbound traffic.<br />
We arrived at the cottage around 3pm in the afternoon, and were promptly presented with with draught beers. They have a beer fridge, complete with taps in the front. The beer fridge did not last long, however, it was moved downstairs to make room for the pool table.<br />
In turn, the power drill came out. Two holes were bored &#8212; one in the floor, the other in a post that supported the loft. They ran a clear plastic hose from the beer fridge in the basement, up through the floor, and into a beer tap that now occupied the hole in the support post. Beer now flowed from the basement to the kitchen.<br />
(Ever seen those beer commercials where a bunch of 20-somethings romp around in this mythical cottage lifestyle? I think we found the model cottage for those commercials.)<br />
The cottage is two floors, with a loft. The main floor is the kitchen/living and dining area. There are no walls. Except for the ones around the bathroom (kind of a necessity). Downstairs are most of the beds, with walls separating most of the areas, and one room that holds Steve, Kathy, and their baby. The loft is accessed from the living area up a fairly steep ladder. There are numerous mattresses up there, capable of sleeping a large number of people.<br />
Dinner that evening was a roast &#8212; nothing horribly fancy, other than it was a roast. (This was a cottage &#8212; I was expecting hot dogs and hamburgers, maybe a steak.) It came with roasted potatoes and fresh vegetables. All courtesy of &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave.<br />
(There are two, actually three, Daves at this cottage. &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave comes from, you guessed it, Scarborough. This is not to confuse him with &#8220;Huntsville&#8221; Dave, who lives just down the road. The third Dave is my dad. He doesn&#8217;t need a prefix for his name though, he&#8217;s just &#8220;Dave&#8221;.)<br />
Anyway, Scarborough Dave is a cook &#8212; used to own a restaurant. He loves cooking, or so it seems. (Cathy told us that they eat far too well at the cottage.) The meal was quite tasty, but nothing compared to what awaited us the following night.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Allison was supposed to call me when she got downtown. I was a bit concerned that it was 2:00pm, and I hadn&#8217;t heard from her. I was supposed to pick her up at 2:00 at the Stadium Skytrain station. We still had to go over to Kitsilano, pick up a wad of business cards, drive to the airport, park the car, check the bags, eat, and get on the plane. By 4:00pm. Time was running short.<br />
I was half-way to the car when my cell phone rang. I was happy I&#8217;d ducked out when I did. A few minutes later, we were on our way to Kits. One of Allison&#8217;s friends (a graphic designer) had made new cards for Allison, but had left them at her friend&#8217;s place (Allison&#8217;s friend had already left on vacation). We stopped only long enough to pick them up and head towards Granville Street.<br />
The trip down was uneventful. We dropped the car off at the Park N&#8217; Fly, hopped a shuttle, and arrived at the terminal just after 3:00pm. So far, everything was going like clockwork. Figures we&#8217;d be the ones to find the broken gear.<br />
Something told us that we were in for trouble when we stepped up to the counter. I said &#8220;virtual ticket&#8221;, and the clerk&#8217;s eyes glazed over. Even after we&#8217;d produced our identification, it took nearly 20 minutes to check us in. Colour me unimpressed. Allison was convinced this twit didn&#8217;t know how to use a computer. Everything was punched in with two fingers, and it took no less than five minutes to print the lousy boarding pass!<br />
Finally, the luggage accepted, we made a bee-line for Harvey&#8217;s, and some much-needed food. All would have gone well, except for the guy in front of me who ordered nearly everything on the menu. Luckily, Allison was a while getting her magazine, so I finished about the same time she got back.<br />
We weren&#8217;t late arriving at the gate, but the general boarding call was long since called. I felt sorry for the poor woman sitting on the aisle of our row. I think I hit her twice with my bag, and stepped on her toe. I don&#8217;t like having to take two bags on a plane &#8212; too inconvenient.<br />
The flight was pleasant: faster than usual, quite smooth, a good in-flight movie (&#8220;Swing&#8221;), and decent meals. Well, almost decent. Although Canadian Airlines now has much more flavourful meals, they&#8217;ve skimped on a few things. Take dessert for example: It was a Halloween-sized Toblerone bar. What happened to the apple crisp, eh? Or the (somewhat disgusting) cheesecakes?<br />
And the butter. Hello, what&#8217;s wrong with butter? No, they had to give us Becel. Not even decent margarine, but Becel. Blech! It&#8217;s bad enough that I can&#8217;t eat salted peanuts on the flight anymore, but I can&#8217;t have butter now. What is this world coming to?<br />
We arrived in Toronto at 11:00pm EDT, about 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The idea was to grab the bags, grab a taxi, and head home. My dad, however, beat us to it, nearly scaring Allison half to death as we waited for our luggage.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://geoff.wp/1999/09/naramata-wedding/" rel="bookmark">Wedding in Naramata</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several weeks ago, we received an invitation to a gala event in the Okanagan for one of Allison&#8217;s friends, Heather. She was getting married to her significant other, Brian. We were asked to attend the three-day event in Naramata. (Naramata is, for lack of any better description, suburban Penticton. Penticton, just in case you&#8217;re looking on a map, is at the south end of Okanagan Lake, about 30-40 minutes from Kelowna.)<br />
Allison was considered part of Heather&#8217;s inner circle of friends &#8212; she attended the shower and the stag parties. Now the question you are undoubtedly asking is: How does Allison know Heather? (Okay, maybe you&#8217;re not, but it&#8217;s still interesting.) A couple of years ago, Allison was enrolled in the Young Entrepreneurs Program, of which Heather was the instructor. Yes, Allison was Heather&#8217;s student. One of Heather&#8217;s other friends described Allison as Heather&#8217;s &#8220;most favouritest student&#8221;. (In actuality, Allison often helped in the class, as she was frequently bored with the lack of stimulating or challenging material.)<br />
So from student to peer, Allison was called upon to travel to the Okanagan and witness matrimonial bliss. With a &#8220;guest&#8221;, of course. We took it upon ourselves to use the situation as research for our own event, currently aimed at mid-summer next year (we&#8217;re still working on the exact date).<br />
Because the event was for three days, we hoped we might be able to save a little money by staying a night at Chateau Tisdale in Kelowna. Luckily, the Chateau&#8217;s owners were very accommodating, and loaned us use of the house, even though they were going to Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park.<br />
I love my relatives.<br />
So on Friday afternoon, we threw our things into Allison&#8217;s &#8217;87 Toyota Corolla, shifted in gear, and headed directly to the Bay. I needed a shirt for the event, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to buy one yet. It was a nice light aquamarine (as close a colour as I can think of) and a tie (yes, a tie) to go with it. Then we were off &#8230; once we dropped off a library book.<br />
We drove until we reached outer Abbotsford, at which time we filled up on gas. It was a long drive to Kelowna, and the last think you want to have happen is run out of gas between Hope and Merritt &#8212; 120 kilometres of zilch civilization, and $20/litre gasoline. No, I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; tow trucks will charge you that much, because there&#8217;s no other place to get it.<br />
Aside from a quick stop in Hope to obtain a small dinner, our next stop was in Merritt, where we were in need of something to drink. After you spend a significant amount of time on the coast, you&#8217;ll find your body requires more and more liquid when travelling in drier climates.<br />
As we departed Kelowna, I got a chance to look up at the sky Allison had commented on earlier. It was cool and clear that night &#8212; the clearest sky I have seen in over a decade. And dark. It was so dark that for the first time in since-I-don&#8217;t-know-when, I saw the Milky Way. Across the sky is usually a large whitish band, where we can see the rest of the galaxy. City lights drown it out completely &#8230; but not at 1,100 metres in the dead of night. We pulled over for a while and stared up at the night sky.<br />
Kelowna was cold when we arrived, barely in the teens (we were used to low 20s back in Vancouver). After finding the key stashed in the backyard, we found the house wasn&#8217;t much warmer. It seems my relatives had turned the heat off. Fine with me, as we were getting free accommodation. It just made using certain objects in the house (particularly those in the bathroom) a bit on the &#8230; breathtaking side.<br />
We rose late the night morning, groggy from our long trip. After quick romps through the shower, we headed out to find something to eat. Despite the fact that Kelowna is a neat little resort town, it has one little problem &#8212; a lot of things don&#8217;t open until later in the day. We had hoped to have Mexican for lunch. The only Mexican place we could find didn&#8217;t open until 4:00pm. We ended up at the Earl&#8217;s, overlooking the lake.<br />
Earl&#8217;s isn&#8217;t known for speed. This particular restaurant was stuck in what appeared to be an extension of the Kansas Interspatial Distortion (see Observer&#8217;s Log: Volume 3), where time slowed to a crawl. It took nearly an hour and a half to order, eat, and get our bill. We were 20 minutes late getting to &#8220;Salmon on the Beach&#8221;.<br />
This was the first of three wedding-related events (actually, four, if you count the ceremony and reception as separate). This was the get-together for all the people involved (including guests) in the wedding. There were between 120 and 150 people, but exact numbers were impossible to guess, because we didn&#8217;t know who was a guest and who wasn&#8217;t.<br />
Allison and I were among the youngest in the group, and felt mostly like outsiders. However, we were quickly welcomed by Heather&#8217;s mom, aunt, soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, and numerous other people. We certainly didn&#8217;t feel like outsiders by the end.<br />
The families had commandeered a park in the corner of Naramata, where they set up volleyball nets, horseshoe pits, picnic tables (all courtesy of the town), and food &#8230; lots and lots of food. All of it homemade. Grilled salmon, caught fresh in Port Alberni, along with fresh corn on the cob, salads of nearly every kind, and lots of fresh vegetables. Dessert was a selection of pies made from nearly every imaginable fruit. If you could fend off the wasps long enough, it was a good meal. (No-one was stung, to the best of my knowledge.)<br />
One of the more unexpected events was marked with a sign, reading &#8220;Irish Jigging&#8221;. They were referring to dancing, of course. Problem: &#8220;Jig&#8221; is a word used by the British to describe the Irish dancing. It does not mean the same thing in Ireland. In fact, it refers to the act of procreation. Not exactly what those who wrote the sign had in mind.<br />
We stayed until it was difficult to see the people playing volleyball. It was also so cold we could actually start seeing our breath (of course, that could have been from sucking in too much smoke from the bonfire). Apparently, the volleyball players continued to the point where they couldn&#8217;t see the ball.<br />
On the way back, we debated on what to do with the remainder of the evening. Both of us decided that a movie was in order. We hoped to be back in downtown Kelowna in time for a movie, but we weren&#8217;t certain we could make it. Luckily for us, we passed by the Westbank Caprice Theatres, which was showing a wide range of movies. Opting for the immediate guarantee of a movie, we stopped.<br />
We ended up seeing a rather appropriate film, insofar as the basic event that was to take place the following day &#8212; Runaway Bride, starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Given, we didn&#8217;t expect to see Heather making a 100 metre dash away from the altar the next day, but we figured it would be good for a laugh.<br />
I&#8217;d just like to go on record: I didn&#8217;t suggest the movie. I merely agreed to it.<br />
Twenty dollars and two hours of our lives that we&#8217;ll never see again (Allison and I hit the &#8220;why are we watching this drivel&#8221; point at the same time, however we also realized that we had nothing else better to do, so we stayed and watched), we returned home, and promptly passed out.<br />
We were off and running early the next morning, making a direct hit on the De Dutch Pannekoek house. It was an experiment the both of us had been interested in performing. We had heard good things about the place, and thought it might be good for a test run. All in all, our spur-of-the-moment decisions to try something that weekend turned out fairly lousy &#8230; the breakfast included.<br />
I dropped Allison off at home, and quickly made a run to the Summerhill Winery, about a kilometre or so away from Chateau Tisdale. I figured that the loan of the entire house was worth at least two bottles of nice wine. Sadly, our once-favourite winery was nearly out of stock (the fall wine season is just about to start, and the spring lineup is almost gone). Remembering the St. Hubertus Winery not too far away, I made a hasty exit to check there.<br />
As usual, the St. Hubertus Winery was empty &#8230; of people, that is. It&#8217;s one of those little treasures that not many people know about. I knew exactly was I was looking for: a bottle of Oak Bay Gamay Noir (a very tasty red) and a recommended white wine. I learned something that day: Ageing wine in oak barrels means a lot. St. Hubertus has two flavours of Gamay Noir &#8212; one aged in stainless steel, the other in oak. The oak tastes significantly better. If the label says &#8220;Vinters Reserve&#8221;, you&#8217;ve got the *wrong* one.<br />
Returning after 20 minutes, toting two bottles of wine, I quickly got to work getting ready to leave. That meant showering, shaving, packing, and taking the wrinkles out of my new shirt. That was a challenge that completely amazed me. It took forever. Finally, after much work, the wrinkles were mostly removed, and we darted out the door. We were a bit pressed for time.<br />
The wedding was at 3:30 (or so said the invitation). That meant moving quickly, as it takes an hour (at least) to get from Kelowna to Naramata. This is mostly because of the zillion or so curves and dips along Naramata Road. Luckily, we were provided with a map that gave us the location. After thinking we might have got lost (we weren&#8217;t alone on that point), we found Heather&#8217;s grandparent&#8217;s house, half-way up the side of the mountain.<br />
Wow.<br />
Let me repeat that &#8212; wow.<br />
A nicer home, I have not seen. I couldn&#8217;t tell you when it was built, but someone made a careful plan to make sure that every possible vista was exploited. There isn&#8217;t one square inch on that property, in or out of the house, that doesn&#8217;t have a killer view.<br />
The ceremony was held on the spacious driveway/walkway that overlooked the lake and surrounding hillsides. Although it had been raining all day, the sun&#8217;s appearance only 30 minutes before was making the event a very memorable one.<br />
Brian and his entourage appeared roughly 10 minutes after we arrived, followed by Heather about five minutes later. The ceremony itself was short, lasting only about 15 minutes in total length. That&#8217;s not including the &#8220;intermission&#8221; in the middle, where Brian and Heather went off to sign the marriage licence, then returning to finish the ceremony. A little strange, if you ask me.<br />
Afterwards, we got into a receiving line to greet the wedding party and the newlyweds. This something that Allison and I are considering avoiding. It&#8217;s a long, drawn out detail that uses a lot of time that we think could be put to better use &#8230; like pictures, or getting from Point A to Point B (this all depends on where we have our photos taken, of course).<br />
Punch and hors d&#8217;oeuvres followed. Then it was back to Penticton for the reception at the Ramada. This gave us some time to whip through our hotel and drop our things off. We had checked in on our way up to Naramata, but didn&#8217;t want to spend the time unloading items. Not that it really mattered&#8230;<br />
The reception was more research for us. Allison had me take pictures of the cake, head table, and one of the guest tables for reference. We also realized that the room isn&#8217;t that big an issue &#8212; it really doesn&#8217;t dominate the atmosphere. We thought about how we would arrange people, where we would put food, what kind of drinks we would serve (and where we&#8217;d get them), and so on and so on.<br />
Our table mates included a couple who were loosely related to Heather (no blood relation at all, but were nonetheless a valued part of the family), named Micki and Donald. Yes, you read that right. They commented on the oddness of the two names. We noted it was a little weird that they didn&#8217;t go by something like Mick and Don. But hey &#8212; they&#8217;re not us.<br />
The dinner was quite nice, including a couple of salads (green, potato, and pasta), chicken kiev, roast beef, and buns. The cake was delicious, even though I had no idea what it was.<br />
When it finally came time to dance, the silliness started. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that about 50% of those attending were sufficiently inebriated. One in particular, one of Brian&#8217;s friends, claimed he was &#8220;a professional alcoholic&#8221;. This, as he bought nine beers and two rum and cokes (he was using up $50 he didn&#8217;t want to convert before returning to Ireland).<br />
Anyway, back to the dancing. Lots of people danced silly dances, including the dreaded &#8220;Chicken Dance&#8221;. That&#8217;s #1 of the top 10 songs I will try with all my might to keep out of our wedding. The Macarena comes in at #2. They played that, too. Dance I did not, owing to the severe pain my shoes were inflicting on my left little toe. Mental note for next year: Do not wear sandals in the week prior to the wedding &#8212; my toes are a little too splayed to fit into dress shoes properly.<br />
The reception ended around 1am, at which time we returned to our motel, and hit the sack.<br />
The next morning was supposed to be the brunch, where all those involved could scarf down a tasty way to start the day. We thought about the traffic we would face, and opted instead to get a head start on the mayhem. We didn&#8217;t avoid the idiots, though, nearly missing one such idiot as he tried to pass another car on a hill, with us next to a cliff. We had a maximum of two feet to spare between us. It really got the ol&#8217; heart pumping.<br />
The trip back signified the end of summer. As we climbed through the mountains, we noticed that it was dark and dreary &#8212; just what winter looks like around here. Then it started to rain. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, it&#8217;s only water. After a moment, I noticed that the rain wasn&#8217;t splattering like rain &#8230; it was sleet. Not even before I said: &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s sleet!&#8221; did the sleet become snow. Not just a little snow, a *lot* of snow. So much snow that the windshield wipers gummed up, and we accumulated a bit on the car.<br />
Yes folks, when you see snow falling around you, you know summer&#8217;s over.<br />
We drove until we reached Abbotsford, where we pulled off for lunch. Again, our trend of turtle-paced service continued, for what reason we didn&#8217;t know. After an hour, we resumed our trek west.<br />
Our option to leave early paid off, we avoided the traffic we had dreaded. We pulled into our parking garage, and let Allison&#8217;s car recover from its 1000+ km journey. The drive probably did it well, though &#8212; it&#8217;s primarily used for city driving.<br />
That evening, we went downtown to witness Mary, a band fronted by the sister of one of Allison&#8217;s friends. It was a good show, save for the volume differential between the drummer and the vocals (namely the former mostly drowned out the latter). Then it was home for a rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Stress. I hate it. It sucks the life right out of me, and leaves nothing but exhaustion and bad moods. In short, I don&#8217;t do well under a large amount of it for a long period of time. And when you consider that I haven&#8217;t been working weekends, I&#8217;m really wondering how I survived at Arkipelago for so long without going loony.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much the direction I&#8217;m headed in now &#8212; loony. Rather, I was, until the weekend. I&#8217;ve been busting my rear as of late &#8230; actually, as of the last two months, trying to get about a dozen projects to completion. Of prominence was the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit report. It&#8217;s worth about 3/4 of a million to us, so needless to say, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure to get it done.<br />
And that&#8217;s the problem &#8212; pressure. I&#8217;m under way too much of it. So much so that I haven&#8217;t slept well in more weeks than I can remember, and what little time I&#8217;ve had all to myself has been taken up by commuting from home to work and back.<br />
I need a vacation. Badly.<br />
Regrettably, my vacation won&#8217;t likely come until early October, when I plan to make a visit home. So until then, I take my rest time whenever I can get it. To compensate for my most recent bout of near-crazed stress, Allison and I opted to visit the Island for the weekend.<br />
Unlike our usual habit, we drove the car to the Island (via the ferry, of course). We caught the last ferry out of Vancouver, which unlike normal, was full of people returning from the PNE. Not a total surprise &#8212; getting to the PNE from the Island is a bit difficult, but not impossible for the determined.<br />
We arrived at the Collins&#8217; just around 11:30pm, at which time we sat down and talked for a while. Jane arrived after not too long, said &#8220;Hello&#8221; and promptly vanished. Randy came home not long after Jane, but stayed around to talk. Before long, it was well after 2:00am, and we were ready to pass out.<br />
The next morning, the house was virtually empty. The Collins were out with friends, and Allison&#8217;s siblings were nowhere to be found. It was time for us to vacate for our excursion of the day.<br />
The West Coast. Since I arrived in Vancouver in January of 1998, I hadn&#8217;t been to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Sounds a little odd, perhaps? While the Island is not very wide (only a hundred kilometres or so), there is no direct east-west highway. This is because of a small mountain problem.<br />
Getting to Tofino (one of our ultimate destinations) from Nanaimo requires a drive to Parkville, then to Port Alberni, then to Ucuelet, and finally to Tofino. All in all, it&#8217;s about 250 kilometres. There&#8217;s no way to do that in less than three hours.<br />
Unless you&#8217;re a raving lunatic, of course.<br />
The drive to Port Alberni is nice and easy &#8212; I&#8217;ve done most of it before (it&#8217;s the same route to Cathedral Grove). But once you&#8217;re out of Port Alberni, you&#8217;re into rough country. The roads weave, rise and fall like a roller coaster. The only difference is that you&#8217;re not attached to the track, and you have to deal with trains going in the opposite direction and trains trying to run you off the road.<br />
Since I&#8217;ve arrived here, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that BC has some of the worst drivers in Canada. At least in Montreal, everyone expects you to drive like a maniac. Many people have suggested that &#8220;flat-landers&#8221; (aka everyone who came from east of the Rockies) can&#8217;t drive here &#8212; they drive too fast, they take turns to quickly, yadda yadda yadda. Given, I see a lot of out-of-province license plates on cars driving so fast it would make Mario Andretti queasy. But my general fear is of the freaks that are living in this province.<br />
Anyway, we managed to finally get to Ucuelet shortly after 2:00pm. Starving, we found our way to a small grocery store to purchase snacks. We had thought of a restaurant, but Ucuelet (population: 5) isn&#8217;t well-stocked with interesting places to eat.<br />
Okay, all seriousness aside, Ucuelet is a nice place. To visit. I wouldn&#8217;t want to live there. Allison&#8217;s cousin, however, does. Her husband is the town planner. You might think: &#8220;Why would a town that small require a town planner?&#8221; The answer to that is our second destination: Tofino.<br />
Tofino was once like Ucuelet &#8212; small. Tiny. A blip on the map that you couldn&#8217;t get to without traversing gravel logging roads. It was an ordeal that few took. Then the government (bless their souls) paved the aforementioned logging road, and designated it Highway 4. Suddenly, getting from one side of the Island to the other was a bit easier. And Tofino was conveniently situated not far from Long Beach, which has some of the best surfing in Canada.<br />
That&#8217;s why Tofino got bigger. It got big fast. According to many who told me, Tofino also sprawled. It went commercial. It didn&#8217;t have that &#8220;west coast feel&#8221;. Ucuelet, only 40 kilometres away (and much closer to the Highway to Civilization) opted not to become an eyesore. Hence, the town planner.<br />
That being said, we figured Tofino had more to offer in terms of lunch, albeit a late one. So off we went.<br />
Between Ucuelet and Tofino is Pacific Rim National Park. It protects Long Beach and the surrounding area. There are several areas to visit in the park, but on that particular day, we were only interested in getting to Tofino.<br />
At first, I thought we had arrived in the outer limits of the town. From what others had told me, Tofino was a sprawling mess. I expected McDonald&#8217;s restaurants, gas stations &#8212; all the tacky stuff you&#8217;d expect to see in a tourist town. Frankly, I&#8217;d love to know what everyone complains about.<br />
Tofino is &#8230; quaint. Yes, quaint is exactly the word I&#8217;d use. It&#8217;s small, compact, with no real &#8220;strip&#8221; to speak of. It takes about a minute to travel from one side to the other. Then you&#8217;ve seen it, and you can move on with life.<br />
Tofino is more-or-less in the centre of Clayquot Sound. Name sound familiar? Remember all the protests a few years back? This was one of the centres for the protesters. Clayquot Sound has a lot of temperate rainforest &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest in North America, logged areas not included. It&#8217;s also the wettest &#8230; 20 feet a year. Luckily, we only got drizzled on.<br />
Lunch being the major concern, we drove around briefly (like I said, the town is small), until we spotted the Sea Shanty. Perhaps not the most elegant name, but they serve a mean shrimp caesar wrap. Not that I ate one &#8212; Allison did, complete with the fanciest salad I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. I opted for a rather large bowl of clam chowder (not that I had the intention of ordering a large bowl, it just came that way) and a small caesar salad. Both of us were quite content with our meals, especially considering how cheap they were.<br />
So, there&#8217;s my commercial for this issue &#8212; if you&#8217;re in Tofino and you&#8217;re hungry, go for the Sea Shanty.<br />
Afterwards, we wandered about a bit, checking out some of the local stores, before we ended up at the Eagle Aerie Gallery. This is Roy H. Vickers&#8217; personal art gallery. Roy Vickers is possibly one of the most famous (living) artists on the West Coast. He lives and works here, living in some remote town on the Island, with his gallery in Tofino.<br />
He&#8217;s a Tsimshian artist who creates beautiful artwork with Native themes. His artwork frequently requires the use of special lighting so you get the full effect (sometimes you can&#8217;t see a feature unless you&#8217;re looking in the right angle). Allison and I would love to buy a print of his, except we can&#8217;t spare the $3000.<br />
Upon exiting, Allison suggested we go to Long Beach. The sun was beginning to break through the oppressive cloud cover, so a trip to the beach seemed like a good idea.<br />
Long Beach is aptly named &#8212; it&#8217;s a few miles in length. But don&#8217;t be mistaken &#8212; this isn&#8217;t your average beach. In fact, this isn&#8217;t your average coast. The west coast of Vancouver Island is quite dangerous. There are vicious rip currents, rogue waves, and storms that make The Blair Witch Project look like Barney and Friends reunion. Many people are killed each year who don&#8217;t heed warnings or take the right precautions.<br />
The water is also cold. About 52F (11C) degrees. Unless you&#8217;re wearing a wetsuit, it&#8217;s not the sort of thing you want to be splashing around in for any length of time. Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop Allison or I from romping around the waves &#8230; so long as they didn&#8217;t pass our knees.<br />
But even at such a shallow depth, you can feel the rip current. Normally, when you stand in the sand where waves hit the beach, the sand under your feet is eaten away and you sink. That effect is very pronounced at Long Beach. Still, there were many people out surfing in the waves.<br />
We stayed only about 45 minutes, realising that if we stayed much longer, it would be dark by the time we got back to Nanaimo &#8212; and the trip back isn&#8217;t one you want to take in the dark.<br />
We stopped for a short while in Port Alberni, partially because we wanted to see the infamous channel. This is a large fjord that runs more than half-way into Vancouver Island. Originally, it didn&#8217;t quite go all the way through to Port Alberni, but some simple dredging and blasting took care of that. Now Port Alberni is actually a shipping port, allowing ships to avoid the bottlenecks at Vancouver Harbour.<br />
Returning to Nanaimo, we found we were unable to find a restaurant to suit our culinary desires. As such, we ended up back at the Collins, ordering Domino&#8217;s Pizza. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, of course.<br />
The next morning, I was awakened by the sound of a ringing telephone. At the time I didn&#8217;t know it, but it was in fact Allison doing a loop-back call with the phone so she wouldn&#8217;t have to go downstairs and wake me up. She was lucky that I was ready to get up anyway &#8212; I would&#8217;ve probably gone back to sleep, otherwise.<br />
We were out of the house about five minutes later, heading to Wellington Hall. Mrs. Collins wanted to experiment with some ideas for the wedding.<br />
Oh yeah, you probably wonder about that, eh? We put it off, due to some extenuating circumstances, and have rescheduled for next year, either in late July or early September (August is out due to Allison&#8217;s cousin, who is also getting married), depending on whether Allison decides to do her Masters or not.<br />
We&#8217;ll let you know.<br />
Anyway, we then ended up in Wedding Research mode, visiting several places around Nanaimo before finally giving up for the day. Still not enough decisions, but we&#8217;re not too pressed for time.<br />
Getting home was another issue. We hoped to make the 7pm ferry &#8230; along with about 500 other cars. We ended up in a line the lengths of which I hadn&#8217;t even imagined, let alone experienced. Surprisingly enough, it went fairly quickly, and we managed to make the special 8pm sailing (BC Ferries will run periodic special runs when traffic is high).<br />
It was a Fast Ferry. Yay. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as our previous experience, but then again, the Fast Ferry excels at the Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay run &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have to turn around.<br />
Soon, we were home, resting up for another week of solid work. Next week &#8212; off to Naramata for a wedding. Yep, another log entry&#8217;s a-coming&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another birthday has come and gone, and save for a minor panic attack when I realised I wasn&#8217;t 21 anymore (yes, that <em>actually</em> happened, believe it or not), I&#8217;m doing okay.<br />
Things got off to a start on Friday, when Pure3D (my group at the office) went out to celebrate two birthdays &#8212; mine (obviously), and Neall, who is exactly one day older than me. (Although Neall&#8217;s birthday was the day before, we really didn&#8217;t get our act in gear to go out for lunch that day; we rolled two birthdays into one.)<br />
I was supposed to go to a softball game that night, but I opted not to go, rather wanting to spend some time with Allison doing something other than sitting at home, working on the computer or watching a movie. (No, we haven&#8217;t been out a lot as of late.)<br />
After making a quick trip to Burnaby to pick up Allison, we came downtown to go to our favourite Greek restaurant, Olympia, on Denman St. (Yes, Allison could have come downtown and saved me the trip, but I didn&#8217;t make up my mind until I got home.) Tyler joined us towards the end of our evening meal (having already had his dinner).<br />
The three of us wandered about the Denman Street area for a while, before ending up at Death By Chocolate for dessert. (It&#8217;s actually kiddie-corner to Olympia, but we didn&#8217;t want to stuff ourselves any fuller at the time.) Following dessert, we adjourned to Tyler&#8217;s place to continue with our in-depth conversation. Unfortunately, we strayed back onto the dreaded Theory of Relativity issue (see [[Canada Day in Kelowna, Winery Tours, and Penticton]]).<br />
The next morning, we headed out on our adventure of the day. For my birthday, Allison was taking me on the Royal Hudson. The Royal Hudson is a train of vintage cars driven by a steam-powered locomotive built in 1940. The locomotive is a 4-6-4 Hudson, number 2860. King George VI was very impressed by the locomotive&#8217;s performance when he and Queen Elizabeth (aka the Queen Mother) travelled across Canada by train in 1939. He bestowed the designation of &#8220;Royal&#8221; on the engine.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what they tell tourists. In reality, CP applied for permission to use the royal crowns and the &#8220;Royal&#8221; moniker to increase revenues by promoting a &#8220;royal&#8221; train. In fact, the entire 2860 class (numbers 2860-2864) all had the designation &#8220;Royal&#8221;.<br />
Despite its Royal lineage, the locomotive was taken out of service in the 50s, and put on freight service until the mid-60s. At that point, she was destined for museums. In the early 70s, enthusiasts convinced BC Rail that they should resurrect the Royal Hudson, and put it into regular service as a tourist train. The Royal Hudson now runs between May and October, running a short length of BC Rail&#8217;s track (BC Rail is the third largest Canadian railway after CP and CN) between North Vancouver and Squamish.<br />
We arrived about 15 minutes before departure, and hastily took our place on board in the end car, where we would have brunch. A few minutes later, the train softly lurched forward, and we were off.<br />
This part of the trip I had been on before &#8212; Allison had taken me on the Pacific Starlight last year (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]). Unlike the Starlight, however, this was a day-time excursion, and the trip ended in Squamish, not in Porteau Cove.<br />
Brunch began with a fruit cup, made of chunks of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple. We finished the cup just before entering West Vancouver. Apparently, we weren&#8217;t supposed to eat while waving to all the onlookers.<br />
The Royal Hudson, like most steam trains, attracts a lot of attention, even if the train makes two trips through West Van every day. It&#8217;s the only train allowed to blow its whistle. Another bizarre bylaw makes everyone wave at the train as it goes by, which forces everyone on the train to wave back.<br />
As we approached Horseshoe Bay, we were treated to the entrée: A large piece of freshly broiled salmon (it was about 1.5&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 5&#8243; in size). It rested on a thin slice of fresh focaccia bread, over a baby green salad with basalmic vinaigrette. The salmon was very good. Allison debated over whether it was better than last year&#8217;s salmon. It was certainly different &#8212; Allison thought it was better, whereas I thought it was on par; I thought last year&#8217;s fish was excellent.<br />
Dessert arrived around Porteau Cove &#8212; trifle. Unlike my father&#8217;s, which has a bottle of brandy (or sherry &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember which is it) at the bottom, this was cake, fruit, and custard. It was very tasty. This isn&#8217;t to say that my father&#8217;s trifle isn&#8217;t tasty &#8212; goodness knows he *loves* it &#8212; but this one was alcohol-free.<br />
Arriving in Squamish, we had several options. BC Rail makes a point of flogging the tourism on the Royal Hudson as much as possible. They even go so far as to hire tour operators to come on board and convince people to go on tours around Squamish, including a trip to Shannon Falls, a river-rafting tour, or flights over the nearby glacier. All of them are designed to fit into the two hours you have before the train departs.<br />
We opted for the tour that came with the price of the ticket &#8212; a visit to the West Coast Railway Heritage Museum, operated by the West Coast Railway Association. To get there, we piled into a vintage 1950s bus, which had scarcely put on 170,000 miles, and were whisked away to a train-lover&#8217;s paradise.<br />
The WCRHM is a 12 acre park, not far from the downtown terminus for Squamish. It sits just to the side of the main north-south BC Rail lines, facilitating easy delivery of new acquisitions.<br />
The park has many examples of old rolling stock (rail cars, passenger cars) and locomotives. It has the only remaining PGE steam train (the other two are lying at the bottom of lakes), one of the original diesel locomotives used to haul CP&#8217;s Canadian transcontinental train, and even a vintage 1890 business car (the equivalent of today&#8217;s LearJets).<br />
Trains aren&#8217;t Allison&#8217;s cup of tea, that much I&#8217;m certain of. But she let me have my day, even allowing me the joy of riding on a miniature railway (which cost a mere dollar per person). I enjoyed the whole day so much, I&#8217;m seriously considering joining the WCRA as a volunteer. Railways are a huge part of our modern society&#8217;s past, and I want to help them have a future.<br />
Filing back onto another bus, we returned to the Royal Hudson at about 1:15. As we couldn&#8217;t board until 1:30, I took the opportunity to take some pictures of the engine and the train. In fact, I took an entire roll of film that day. (Those of you who don&#8217;t know me that well should know that this isn&#8217;t an unusual thing for me &#8212; I tend to be a bit shutter-happy.)<br />
The return trip was almost as good as the trip up. This time, we were one car behind the engine. The whole way back, I could hear the chugging of the engine. Several times I went to the vestibules (the &#8220;doors&#8221; to enter the cars from the platform) to stick my head out and listen. I&#8217;m still washing out bits of sand and carbon from my hair&#8230;<br />
I was almost disappointed when we arrived back in North Vancouver, the trip over. Those trips always seem to go too quickly. We climbed down from the train, and make our way towards our car. The next stop was Horseshoe Bay, and off to the Island.<br />
Arriving at the Bay, I quickly noticed a problem &#8212; there was very little parking. In fact, after dropping off Allison and driving around a bit, I realised that there was no parking at all. Impark (the parking Nazis in the Lower Mainland) had even gone so far as to deny ferry passengers parking rights at one of the major lots.<br />
At first, I didn&#8217;t think we would make that ferry. Parking was limited. Luckily for us, at the time I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d make it, the ferry traffic was beginning to clear out. In other words, parking spots. Unluckily for us, it was in the most expensive lot: $10 a day.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo, we were picked up by the Collins (as usual) and taken home. Allison and I then stepped out for a while for dinner, allowing me to develop the pictures I&#8217;d taken earlier in the day.<br />
Returning home, I was ambushed by the Collins with a steam locomotive-shaped chocolate cake. Yes, I was a very happy camper that night. I had everything I wanted for my birthday &#8230; except my own family and friends, that is. Luckily for me, most of them sent me cards (both the traditional and the newer electronic variety).<br />
The next day was the day we had come to the Island for: The Comox Air Show. No, this is not a regular Collins (or Vailmont) family event. The only reason we were going (in fact, the only reason I knew there was a Comox Air Show) was Allison&#8217;s uncle Sean.<br />
Sgt. Sean Moran is one of an elite skydiving team called the &#8220;Skyhawks&#8221;. They&#8217;re the parachuting equivalent to the Snowbirds. Sean was one of eight people selected for a year&#8217;s service with the squad. Since May, he&#8217;s been jumping all over North America, including a drop in Oakville on 22 June.<br />
Piling into the Collins&#8217; Honda, we hit the road for the 1.5 hour trip to Comox. Upon arriving, we had another 1.5 hour wait until we got in. Unfortunately, we had taken the &#8220;front&#8221; door route &#8212; the one that was clearly marked. This was the &#8220;opposite&#8221; route to how Gerry and I had gone two years ago &#8212; the &#8220;back&#8221; route.<br />
So, along with about 10,000 other cars, we waited our turn to get into CFB Comox&#8217; field. At one point, we sat for a long time without moving. At first, I thought it was because there were complete idiots who didn&#8217;t know how to organise traffic. I would later find out it was because Allison&#8217;s Aunt Valerie&#8217;s friend Peter&#8217;s car broke down. He would later drive by us on his way home to get it fixed.<br />
Around 12:15, we finally reached the fence surrounding the field. A Buffalo (aircraft, not a mammal) circled above us. As we approached the gate, it dumped three streamers, which fell slowly to the ground. I suspected that it was to test the wind conditions for the Skyhawks. I was right &#8212; little did we know at the time, but Sean and crew were all in the Buffalo, waiting to jump.<br />
Before I progress any further, I should clear something up. Sean is younger than you think he is. He is married to Allison&#8217;s aunt Linda, who is only five years older than Allison &#8212; Sean&#8217;s only about five years older than me. Just in case some of you thought he&#8217;s some old geezer leaping from planes for a kick&#8230;<br />
Finally arriving in the base, we took a few minutes to stroll about. We went past some F-16s, some A-10s (which, last I heard, had been decommissioned), gliders, a C5 Galaxy, a couple of helicopters, and a small city worth of people.<br />
On our way to the field to sit and watch, the show started with one of the Skyhawks floating into the field, carrying an American flag underneath him. (Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s good reason for this &#8212; it was an &#8220;international&#8221; air show, which means the US Air Force had supplied a few planes for show.) He was quickly followed by another Skyhawk carrying a Canadian flag. This was kind of redundant, since all the Skyhawks have Canadian flag parachutes.<br />
Aside: For those of you who watch &#8220;Due South&#8221;, you may remember a series of Mounties who parachuted into the frozen north in the final episode, all with Canadian flag parachutes. I&#8217;ll give you two guesses who did the actual jumps. And no, Sean wasn&#8217;t with them at the time.<br />
No sooner had we taken our position that the next few Skyhawks came down, from a distance of 10,000 feet. The first few came in a stacked tower formation (one on top of the other). Another came down carrying smoke canisters under him. He flew into a spiral (on purpose) to create a &#8220;candy cane&#8221; swirling effect.<br />
Four more skydivers formed a diamond with their parachutes, at which point we heard Sean&#8217;s name come over the PA system. Although we cheered, we didn&#8217;t hear anyone else &#8212; I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d be able to hear the others cheer. As it turns out, finding them wasn&#8217;t a problem. I just followed Sean to where he landed &#8212; the rest of the family was there, waiting.<br />
Most of the family (at least from what I gather) was nervous &#8212; after all, he was jumping out of plane. How many people do that in the right minds? I, however, wasn&#8217;t the least bit worried. Now, this could partly be because I&#8217;d only seen Sean twice, and really don&#8217;t know him that well. However, I also knew that these were consummate professionals, who didn&#8217;t like taking risks. The odds of something going wrong were reasonably slim.<br />
After Sean collected his parachute, he and the rest of the team bounded over the fence (as well as someone carrying 30lbs of parachute can bound) and held an impromptu demonstration of how to pack a parachute back up. It was rather fascinating. We basically ignored the rest of the air show until Sean left, to go see the sponsors.<br />
Sean would return later in the show, taking Allison&#8217;s grandfather to the area reserved for base personnel and their family for a surprise presentation. I tagged along to take pictures.<br />
Sean had the Skyhawks sign a special poster, and place a sticker that said &#8220;Happy 80th Ernest&#8221;. In a quick ceremony, the captain of the team presented the poster to Allison&#8217;s grandfather, who was quite touched by the gesture.<br />
Skyhawks are brutally nice. Of course, they have to be &#8212; their ambassadors for the Canadian Armed Forces. They are effectively in media relations. Sean&#8217;s quite good at it, too. He rather likes it, so he told me. They were so nice as to sign brochures for us. Sean goes down as the first person I&#8217;d ever asked for an autograph.<br />
The Snowbirds were the last event of the show. In typical Snowbird-style, they put on a great show. We didn&#8217;t stay around for the whole event, however, as we had to catch a ferry home. We ducked out while they were still flying about. It almost felt like the Snowbirds were running cover for us as we drove out the exit.<br />
We returned to Nanaimo and prepared to leave for the ferry. We lucked out with another Ferry Classic, which meant we&#8217;d have good seating. Our trip was even complete with celebrities. Rather, celebrity.<br />
As I returned from the galley with empty hands (they had no frozen yoghurt on that trip), I caught the face of an elderly Asian man walking in my direction. It took me only a moment to realise that it was David Suzuki. <em>The</em> David Suzuki. Mr. Nature of Things. Allison was looking at me, her eyes bugged open, nodding vigorously, as if in agreement with the question I was apparently supposed to be asking, namely: &#8220;Is that who I think it is?&#8221;<br />
Upon reaching Horseshoe Bay, we exited the ferry, found the car, and dragged ourselves home.<br />
It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks, and we haven&#8217;t had a chance to slow down. Both Allison and I were exhausted when we got home. Although we had been planning to see the Nanaimo Bathtub Races this weekend, we&#8217;re probably not going to go, opting for some rest.<br />
Besides, it&#8217;s my turn to clean the apartment this weekend&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life&#8217;s a beach.<br />
At least, it should be.<br />
Last weekend was the second busy weekend for Allison and I, the second weekend of the month we weren&#8217;t home. We won&#8217;t be home for a weekend probably until mid-August at the pace things are currently going. Every weekend has something new for us to explore. Frankly, this is a good thing &#8230; provided the weather holds out.<br />
We left on Friday night, meeting at Horseshoe Bay. Knowing that traffic would be a nightmare, Allison left from the apartment early. I left downtown on the 5:07 express to Horseshoe Bay, arriving a mere five minutes before Allison.<br />
We dropped the car off at the Park and Ride, which the local Lion&#8217;s Club. Normally, the lot is free, you just have to walk the kilometre or so to the ferry terminal. When the Lion&#8217;s are about, you have to pay a paltry $5/day (a bargain compared to the other lots), and you get a free ride to the terminal.<br />
We were somewhat excited to find that we would be taking one of the mythical Fast Ferries, the first of which went into service on 1 July. It was supposed to leave at 18:00. We boarded it at 18:07. Needless to say, the Fast Ferry hasn&#8217;t been running exactly up to snuff just yet&#8230;<br />
The Fast Ferry is a catamaran with twin water jet propulsion systems. They run at a supposed 45 knots, making the trip in just under an hour. Supposedly. In actuality, it runs at about 37 knots, and in the long run, might save you about five minutes, all told. Why?<br />
Because we let the government design it, that&#8217;s why.<br />
All fairness aside, they did try. But as Yoda once said: &#8220;Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.&#8221; The design would work well for longer-haul trips. However, the design is not exactly well-suited to the short jaunts across the Strait. You see &#8212; the ship points in only one direction.<br />
Why is that significant? All the other ships point in two directions, allowing them to be driven from either end. No turning, no slowing down to back in; just straight-forward (no pun intended) driving. The Fast Ferry is a uni-directional ship. It has to be turned around before it can go anywhere. It needs a dollar to turn on a dime.<br />
This means that for one leg of the trip, the ship has to turn around at both ends &#8212; otherwise, the cars can&#8217;t get off without backing up themselves. As it stands, it takes too long to empty the ship without people having to drive off in reverse.<br />
And the wake. Homeowners around Bowen Island (which the ferries all pass) have been shocked at the near-tsunami conditions that the ferry generates. It threatens to rip up docks and smash boats against the shore. BC Ferries contends that the wake is minimal.<br />
Minimal, my heiny&#8230;<br />
On the way back, we were on a good ol&#8217; regular ferry. When the Fast Ferry rocketed past us, it sent our ship rocking &#8212; the only time in dozens of crossing that Allison and I have been on where I could actually feel the ship rock due to waves.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me started on the interior &#8220;features&#8221; either. I&#8217;ll just leave my opinion at this: The government would have been far better off spending the money on upgrading our existing ferries and making sure that the less-travelled (but still necessary) routes don&#8217;t suffer due to lack of funds. Heck, you could have built two regular ferries for the price it cost to build one Fast Ferry.<br />
And there are two more coming off the assembly line.<br />
Anyway, we arrived in Nanaimo about one hour and 20 minutes after we left West Vancouver and proceeded to the Collins Family Estate, in the prestigious Divers Lake area. There we were subdued by the plethora of relatives who had descended on the household for the weekend.<br />
It was Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday party. The second one. As you may recall (see [[Snow in Vancouver, Dinner on the Island]]), we had already attended a birthday party at The Grotto in Nanaimo. However, it wasn&#8217;t exactly suitable for a large get-together of friends, so the official party was postponed until the weekend past.<br />
The following morning, we rose and dressed for the occasion. Although not a formal event, we were obviously not going to show up in loud pink shirts and spandex shorts, so we dressed in beige pants and blue shirts.<br />
I&#8217;m not kidding. We really did.<br />
This, of course, was an accident. Neither Allison or I had heard each other the night we packed to leave &#8212; we had inadvertently packed virtually the same outfit. This is not just a fashion faux pas &#8212; it looks really weird. So avoid confusion and embarrassment, I raided Randy&#8217;s closet for a different shirt. It turned out that I grabbed a shirt that Randy had never worn &#8212; it has just been given to him from Mr. Collins. Luckily, though, it fit.<br />
Overall, it was a good party, although Allison and I didn&#8217;t move around too much, we spent most of our time talking to old friends of family (that I didn&#8217;t know), cousins, and Grandma Collins. We didn&#8217;t really know many others.  Late in the afternoon, Grandma Vailmont (the one basically running the whole show) abducted me to play bocci.<br />
Bocci is a bit of a religion there. You can&#8217;t escape it. If you go to a Vailmont family get-together, you&#8217;ll probably end up playing bocci. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t know how &#8212; you&#8217;ll learn. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t like it &#8212; you will. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you have no arms &#8212; someone will throw for you. Resistance is futile.<br />
I ended up on a team with Janet, Mrs. Collins&#8217; cousin, and two of Allison&#8217;s cousins, Kersten (9) and Mitchell (4). Both are young. Like most siblings, they fight a fair bit.<br />
I will wholeheartedly admit that I forgot was sibling rivalry was like &#8212; it had been a very long time since my sister and I had a good screaming match. (We now sit around the kitchen table, drink beer, and discuss finances. My how the times change.)<br />
It was exceptionally difficult to play a close game. If one side got too far ahead, one of the two siblings would be upset. Janet and I got very good at placing balls close to the marker ball, and far away from the marker ball. We adjusted our strategies depending on the accuracy of the younger two&#8217;s throws. In the end, Mitchell (the younger of the two) won by a mere point. Kersten, despite losing, was not upset.<br />
When the party finally ended, it took those of us remaining only a short period of time to clean everything up. As we retreated to the Collins Family Estate, Vicki (one of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters) announced a barbeque at Rathtrevor Beach the following day.<br />
Rathtrevor Beach is the Bay of Fundy of the west coast &#8230; only horizontal. Whereas the Bay of Fundy has very high tides, Rathtrevor Beach has very long tides. If you arrive at the beach at low tide, you&#8217;ll find yourself walking well over a kilometre to find water &#8230; even further to find water deep enough to come up to your neck (assuming you stand 5&#8242; 11 7/8&#8243;).<br />
At any rate, the beach is huge. Gigantic. Enormous. And despite the number of people who show up, virtually empty. This leads to things such as sandcastles, kite-flying, and lots of people walking aimlessly. In short, typical beach-going behaviour.<br />
Upon arriving at the beach, we had to take Kersten and Mitchell out onto the beach &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t wait. Mind you, neither could I. The last time I was on an ocean beach (or a saltwater beach, depending on how you look at it) for the purposes of sitting in the sun and doing beach-related things was in 1991. (Yes, I know I went to the beach in Monterey last year, but it was way too cold to even consider swimming.) It had been a long time since I had walked across a good beach.<br />
And boy, do you every have a long walk. Because the beach is so expansive, it also has a lot of interesting features, most notably tidal pools. Although devoid of fish, the pools have lots of shellfish, crabs, and snails. You can imagine the kids&#8217; reaction to those. Most revolved around &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;ewwww!&#8221;. Allison, Robin (another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters), and Wilma (yet another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters, who lives in Germany) gave out marine biology lessons to those of us not quite up-to-snuff with the proper information. While I&#8217;m at, I&#8217;ll mention Mrs. Collins&#8217; last unmentioned sibling, Laura &#8212; Kersten and Mitchell are her children.<br />
What do you associate sand dollars with? Tropical waters, right? Take a wild guess what thrives all over Rathtrevor Beach? Yep &#8230; thousands of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re everywhere. You can&#8217;t take any of them with you &#8212; that&#8217;s a no-no. But you can pick them up and see what they look like while they&#8217;re still alive. Black ones are living &#8230; the whitish ones have since deceased.<br />
Finally reaching the ocean, we waded in a little ways and splashed around a bit. Baby flatfish (halibut or flounders, probably) skitted about our feet, trying to get away from the two-footed giants traipsing through the middle of their sanctuary.<br />
A few minutes later, we realised that the water was about to soak all the things we&#8217;d left on shore to stay dry. The tide was turning, and beginning to reclaim the shore. It was time to go back for lunch.<br />
After partaking in much the same food as we&#8217;d had the day before, several of us ventured back out onto the beach to build a sandcastle. Initially just Brenna, Kersten, and Mitchell, I soon followed, with several others not far behind. The construction was hasty, mostly because the tide was coming in fairly quickly.<br />
As Brenna build the castle with Kersten and Mitchell, I quickly built an outer wall, designed to keep the water away for a short period of time. The wall wouldn&#8217;t hold the water out indefinitely, but it would at least make for a more interesting destruction of the castle.<br />
Sure enough, the water soon arrived, so Kersten and Mitchell took refuge in their sandy kingdom &#8230; for a few precious minutes. Eventually, the tide ate away at the walls, no thanks to the surrounding adults who were surreptitiously splashing the walls, hastening their demise. The flood inside the walls soon took down the castle&#8217;s structure, ending the brief reign of King Mitchell and Queen Kersten.<br />
Following a short swim in the now-flooded beach, we packed up and headed home. Although we could have made the 19:00 ferry to Vancouver, Allison and I waited until the 21:00. In retrospect, this was a good idea &#8230; we would have travelled on a Fast Ferry, and we all know what I think of them.</p>

		<p>Deciding that the weather here had become too unbearable to stand for another weekend, let alone a long weekend, Allison and I opted to abdicate the Lower Mainland for places sunnier.<br />
At least, that was the plan.<br />
I booked Friday off (don&#8217;t you just hate it when the holiday lands on anything but Friday or Monday?), we packed a few things into a cooler (namely the two tonnes of fruit we received in our organic vegetable delivery &#8212; yes, I know I&#8217;m turning into a hippie), and started driving towards the Okanagan.<br />
Within a couple of hours, we noticed that the rain was beginning to slowly subside. At first, we managed to elude Mother Nature. Every time I said &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s some blue sky!&#8221;, she figured out where we had disappeared to, and covered over all vestiges of the sun.<br />
Arriving in Merritt shortly after noon, we stopped for lunch and a rest break. Having been chastised for jinxing the weather earlier in the trip, I had not said one word about the conditions. As a result, Mother Nature lost track of us again, and the weather was warm and bright. A bit windy too, so we ate lunch in the car for fear of blowing away with the tumbleweeds.<br />
Leaving the Coquihalla highway behind us, we headed towards the Okanagan Valley. This trip, roughly an hour from Merritt, is plagued with many dangers: Severe Winter Weather, tight corners, and many examples of &#8220;driverius moronicus&#8221;. One particular specimen opted to pass three cars (of which I was the lead) right in front of on-coming traffic. The on-coming traffic had to bolt over to the shoulder to prevent a head-on collision. If I had not noticed this happening, we could probably have been in an accident. Had I been a bit quicker, I would have gladly jotted down the turkey&#8217;s license and turned him into the RCMP&#8230;<br />
Arriving alive and unscathed in Kelowna around 1:30pm, we headed in the direction of my relative&#8217;s home. While in Kelowna, we were staying at the luxurious Chateau Tisdale, situated near the shores of Lake Okanagan. Thinking that both my aunt and uncle were working, I thought it best that we show up a bit later.<br />
This gave us the opportunity to sight see a little.<br />
Our first stop was the Kettle Valley planned community. This is a development that some genius thought up a few years ago. On a rather large chunk of land just south of Kelowna, developers are building a very large community, complete with town centre, schools, and character homes. In fact, the entire development is full of character &#8212; Victorian-style homes currently dot the area.<br />
The development is far from complete. It will probably take 20 years or more to finish the development. But it will be very nice when it&#8217;s full of families.<br />
We stopped into the office and one of the show homes to see what it was like. In addition to being considerably cheaper than homes in the Lower Mainland, the homes were high quality, and very nice. We were a bit surprised that none of the salespeople gave us the hard sell. We weren&#8217;t sure if it was because that was their style, or if it was because we looked too young. (We always get the hard sell out here.)<br />
From the Kettle Valley development, we headed back towards my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home. Along the way, we opted to stop into the Summerhill Winery. (So we found out, it&#8217;s a law that all tourists have to stop into at least one winery while in the Okanagan. We had somehow managed to avoid it the first couple of times, but didn&#8217;t want to run the risk of a large fine for breaking the law this time.)<br />
As we rounded the corner, we saw the winery&#8217;s piece de resistance &#8230; a large white pyramid. I&#8217;ll get back to that in a moment or two&#8230;<br />
We pulled into the parking lot, and quickly found two things: 1) There was a free &#8220;sparking wine&#8221; tour, and 2) We missed lunch by about 10 minutes. We stuck around for the 3:00pm tour.<br />
Our tour guide, so we figured, was a ski hill enthusiast working for the summer. (Another weird BC law states that the wineries, in return for getting mandatory visits by all the tourists, also has to hire all the ski bums who can&#8217;t ski during the summer.) She was a good speaker, I will admit, although she did exhibit a bit of attitude.<br />
She took us around the winery, showing us the grapes Summerhill grows, the machines used to press the grapes &#8230; I&#8217;m going to pause here a moment. Interesting things to know about pressing grapes:<br />
Summerhill presses their grapes to roughly 65% of their volume (this is called the &#8220;first pressing&#8221;), then mulches the left overs (including the stems and leaves of the grapes), and puts it back out in the field as fertilizer. Other wineries go to a second pressing, and even a third pressing. The guide expressed her disdain for additional pressings, saying that other wineries weren&#8217;t concerned about quality if they went to these additional pressings. Although she wouldn&#8217;t name names, she did say that the third pressing was usually referred to as the &#8220;rotting grape&#8221;. &#8216;Nuff said.<br />
(Additional note, which I&#8217;ll add before Allison does: Fourth pressings usually become grape juice, and the leftovers are turned into fruit leather. Summerhill, obviously, does not do this.)<br />
Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, we saw the machines used to press the grapes, and then we went into the winery building to see where all the magic takes place. Sparking wine (technically, it *is* champagne, but because &#8220;champagne&#8221; is trademarked for wineries in the Champagne region of France, no-one outside that area can use the term &#8220;champagne&#8221;; look for &#8220;methode classique&#8221; instead) is a work-intensive beverage.<br />
After the wine is left in vats to ferment for a while, it is bottled and capped with bottle caps. They are then shelved for three years while the yeast eats up every scrap of sugar in the wine. (This is why champagne is so dry.) Then they have to &#8220;riddle&#8221; the bottles, which is the laborious part.<br />
First, the bottles are whacked against a rubber tire to loosen up all the yeast (which is now caked to one side of the bottle). All 10,000 bottles of a batch are placed in special riddling racks, which starts the bottle out roughly horizontal. Each day, the riddler comes along, gives each bottle a quarter-turn, moving the bottle a little more vertical. (A riddler can riddle 10,000 bottles in 55 minutes.) By the end of the process, the yeast has collected in the neck of the bottle.<br />
Then the bottles are put into a glycol solution (only the first inch or so of the neck) to freeze the contents, including the leftover yeast. Then comes the fun part &#8212; removing the bottle cap. The caps keep the contents of the bottle under the pressure generated by the yeast&#8217;s by product: Carbon dioxide gas. 125 pounds per square inch of it.<br />
Needless to say, it&#8217;s a very messy process.<br />
The bottles are then topped up with a &#8220;dosange&#8221;, which guarantees 750ml of sparking wine, a little bit of sweet wine and a touch of yeast, and then the hasty corking (with a hefty cork, I might add).<br />
Definitely not a home-brew kind of project.<br />
Following bottling portion came the warehouse &#8230; the pyramid (told you I was getting back to this). It seems that the guy who set up the winery is a huge believer in the power of pyramids. (What can I say, other than the west coast attracts the weirdos.)<br />
There&#8217;s a theory that says a properly-designed pyramid will even out of the flow of tachyons (particles that move faster than the speed of light) and tardyons (particles that move slightly slower than the speed of light). Supposedly this is what causes the power of the pyramid. Instead of going sour, milk turns into yogurt; dull razors sharpen; meat petrifies rather than rots. Our guide suggested that was the reason why all the mummies in Egypt were petrified. I was about to suggest that it was because the bodies were drained of all decay-causing fluids, and then sat in natron (salt) for 40 days to dry it out &#8212; not to mention that most mummies were never in pyramids. But I kept quiet (yeah, I know, it&#8217;s a rarity).<br />
Supposedly, this makes the wine taste better. The winery had held taste tests a couple of years earlier, testing out the theory. Everyone who tasted a wine aged in a pyramid and the same wine aged normally chose the pyramid wine. Can&#8217;t tell you if it was fixed, but that&#8217;s what we were told.<br />
Then came the best part &#8230; the tasting. We were instructed how to taste wines (something which I had only partly known). If it&#8217;s a sparking wine, the first thing you do is look at the bubbles. They should be very small and fast-moving. This is the sign of a good sparking wine (or champagne). If the bubbles are large and lethargic, then you have something called &#8220;Baby Duck&#8221;. Yeah, it&#8217;s fake. If you don&#8217;t have a sparking wine, go to Step 2&#8230;<br />
Look at the clarity of the wine &#8212; it shouldn&#8217;t be cloudy. If it is, put the wine back in the bottle, take it back to the store, and have it replaced. You don&#8217;t want to be sucking back any yeast (that&#8217;s the cloudy stuff). It&#8217;s not lethal, but you&#8217;ll be wishing it was.<br />
Swirl the wine. Look at the film left on the glass. It should split into rivulets as it drains back into the wine. These are called &#8220;legs&#8221;. The thicker and slower the legs, the sweeter the wine. It&#8217;s not a precise measurement, but it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
Look into the glass, where the wine meets the glass itself. This thin barrier is called the &#8220;meniscus&#8221; (something I remember from Grade 7 science). If it&#8217;s a greenish colour (in white wine) or a brownish colour (in red wine), then the wine&#8217;s oxidized. That&#8217;s what you get for not drinking the whole bottle in one shot.<br />
Next you smell. I don&#8217;t know why, you just do. Assumedly, you&#8217;ll know if it smells bad.<br />
Finally, you get to taste it. But not really. Your first sip is rolled around in the mouth, covered all points and corners. You don&#8217;t pay attention to the taste, mostly because you have to orient your mouth to the new flavours of the wine. When you take your next sip, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what the wine actually tastes like. You aerate the wine by (quietly) slurping it. I don&#8217;t know what this does exactly, but listening to 20 retired tourists do this is kinda funny.<br />
After you&#8217;ve done all this, you can finally drink the silly thing. You have to go through this process each time you switch wines, or you won&#8217;t get the full effect.<br />
Of course, that&#8217;s assuming you give a flying fig about all that&#8230;<br />
After the sparking wine (which was quite tasty, I will say), we tried two red and two white wines. Our favourite was the GewÃ«rztraminer. It&#8217;s a sweeter wine, and goes very well with spicy foods. Allison and I also tried their icewine after I made an inquiry as to whether they had any.<br />
Most people drink wines that vary from 0 to 2 in sweetness. Most people I know won&#8217;t drink anything above a 5 &#8212; it&#8217;s too sweet. The Summerhill Riesling Icewine is an 18. None of the wine-tasting techniques work on icewine, incidentally. And if you drink icewine, don&#8217;t try to drink anything else for about 30 minutes &#8212; you won&#8217;t taste a thing.<br />
Luckily, we weren&#8217;t close to being inebriated, so we could leave shortly thereafter. We arrived at the Tisdale&#8217;s around 4:30, and were promptly hugged to death by my aunt (she wasn&#8217;t working that day, as I had thought she might). No sooner than we were sitting in the kitchen did my uncle show up, claiming that their computers had crashed again, and he didn&#8217;t see the need to stick around any longer.<br />
We talked for a couple of hours before setting into dinner mode. The barbequing duties fell on myself, which meant I had to try and not burn the steaks. I got lucky, although they were a bit too much on the well done side. (Thick steaks on an unfamiliar barbeque make for difficult work.)<br />
After dinner, we headed out for the fireworks. This entailed driving down to Kelowna&#8217;s downtown, finding a place to park, and then walking to the appropriate viewing place.<br />
So we walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
Did I mention we walked a lot?<br />
We walked.<br />
Finally, we stopped not far from the north end of town (or so it seemed), just as the fireworks got underway. Not the most spectacular show I&#8217;d seen, but it was far better than the slop Vancouver had put on the year before. It was no Symphony of Fire, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad.<br />
Following the show, we fought through the 50,000 or so people who turned out to get back to the car, and back home. We passed out within moments of hitting the pillows.<br />
We woke up the next morning to the sound of &#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; being bellowed by my uncle. We crawled out of bed and worked our way into the kitchen, to a meal of fried eggs, oranges, toast, superbly-cooked bacon, and cherries. It was a great way to start the day &#8230; especially since Mother Nature had found us again, and clouded everything over.<br />
Before I knew it, my uncle was gone. It wasn&#8217;t long before it was our turn. We bade my aunt good-bye, and then hit the road.<br />
The trip to Penticton is only about 45 minutes, and is a nice drive. Upon arriving, we hunted down our motel &#8212; the Majestic Motor Inn. Yes, the name is cheesy. So&#8217;s the interior of the room. The building was put up in the early 60&#8217;s (by my estimate). The interior hasn&#8217;t changed since then. It was almost fun (except our next door neighbour was a bit freaky).<br />
One of the reasons we were going to Penticton was to meet up with our friends, Lisa and Miran. (Lisa one of Allison&#8217;s best friends; Lisa and Miran being an item; I know Miran from university, since before I met Allison. [Insert clip of &#8220;It&#8217;s a Small World, After All&#8221; here.]) Finding their room, we found that they were nowhere to be found. So off we went.<br />
Lunch was of the order, as it had been a few hours since breakfast. We stopped at a place called &#8220;Joe&#8217;s on the Beach&#8221;, which specialised in New Orleans-style cuisine (at least, as much as the fare of a beach-front greasy spoon could be called &#8220;cuisine&#8221;). For $15, we were certainly not in the complaining mood &#8212; the meal was tasty, although large.<br />
Returning to the outside, we couldn&#8217;t help but notice one thing: Penticton was dead. Here it was, the Canada Day weekend, and the vacation town of the Okanagan was deserted. There didn&#8217;t seem to be any real reason for it.<br />
We walked down the length of Lakeshore Drive, almost to the Peach (a refreshment stand on the waterfront). Deciding we needed some refreshement, not to mention some money, we headed down Winnipeg St. towards the downtown. In a few moments, we hit upon a 7-11.<br />
It had been a really long time since I sat in front of a convenience store, eating a creamsicle and drinking a slurpee. It was kind of like being a kid again. It felt good. It felt free. It felt really really cold when I drank the slurpee too fast and followed up with a large bit of the creamsicle. Lousy brain freeze.<br />
On the way back, we stopped into the Visitor and Wine Information Centre (Penticton is roughly in the middle of the entire wine-making area, so gets the coveted Info Centre as a result). We looked around, picked up a few brochures, and then headed back to the motel.<br />
We got together with Lisa and Miran that night, under the guise of going to a barbeque at the Lake Breeze Winery, in beautiful downtown Naramata. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Naramata is some dinky little place on the eastern side of Lake Okanagan. I don&#8217;t think it has anything but vineyards and orchards, let alone a downtown.)<br />
After zigging and zagging around the countryside a little, we came to the Lake Breeze Winery, only to find that the supposed barbeque wasn&#8217;t on. No explanation, no nothing. I got the feeling that we were the only ones who didn&#8217;t know.<br />
We stopped briefly at a lookout hill on the way back, which turned out to be the mountain that bears the large &#8220;Penticton&#8221; sign, visible from Highway 97 on the opposite side of the lake.<br />
We had dinner that night at Salty&#8217;s Beachside. It tries to take its ambience from the Caribbean. I stress &#8220;tries&#8221;. The food was decent, although nothing really to write home about (which is why I&#8217;m not really mentioning anything other that we ate there).<br />
Following dinner, we retreated to Lisa and Miran&#8217;s motel room to share a bottle of wine. I believe it was a Cabernet Sauvignon from Sumac Ridge, but I could be wrong. Either way, the wine and a discussion of the pyramid at Summerhill led us to one of the weirdest conversations I&#8217;ve ever had.<br />
Miran and I attempted (and mostly failed) to properly explain Einstein&#8217;s Special Theory of Relativity. For about two hours, we tried to explain properly why for a stationary observer, time seems to slow down for someone moving close to the speed of light. (It stands to reason that the person travelling at the speed of light will, in comparison to the stationary person, age less.)<br />
Finally giving up trying to explain it fully, Allison and I went home to sleep.<br />
The next morning, we rose slowly to weather that could be best described as &#8220;spotty&#8221;. Lisa and Miran were off to Oliver to find more wineries, so Allison and I opted to check out Sumac Ridge. The primary reason was because we liked the sound of the lunch we could get at their Cellar Door bistro.<br />
And believe me &#8212; that lunch is something to write home about. Pecan and cornmeal encrusted chicken breast with apricot chutney, served with fresh baby greens with a red wine vinaigrette. Based on a suggestion, we had a glass of 97 Gewurtztraminer. The meal was preceeded by a basket of fresh breads which were absolutely scrumptious. (There&#8217;s a word I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d use.)<br />
Unfortunately, the wine had one minor problem &#8230; we were in no condition to drive anywhere. So we hopped onto the winery tour to work off the alcohol. We found that Sumac Ridge was one of the wineries Summerhill frowns upon &#8212; they do multiple pressings. (If you purchase Sumac Ridge, aim for bottles marked with &#8220;Special Reserve&#8221; &#8212; this is the batch from the first pressing.)<br />
Then it was through the coldest room I&#8217;ve ever been in. Allison and I nearly froze while our guide (another skiing enthusiast) explained why the wines were chilled to near freezing. They were settling out the yeast and a susbstance that sometimes is used in making tartar sauce. The weird things you learn at a winery&#8230;<br />
We purchased two bottles of the Gewurtztraminer (as you might expect, we really liked it) and two small bottles of icewine (at 50ml apiece, there wasn&#8217;t much) &#8212; one was for Lisa and Miran.<br />
We stopped through Summerhill on the way back, eventually buying a small bag of chocolate-covered dried cherries. Very tasty.<br />
We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing. This was, of course, a vacation &#8212; there was no need to work ourselves silly by trying to be too many places at once.<br />
Lisa called us at 6:30 to see if we were ready to go out. The first order of business was the mini-golf. Despite the fact that I quadruple-bogied a few holes, I still managed to beat the others &#8230; by a single stroke. In fact, there was a spread of only four strokes between all of us. (In short, we were all roughly the same calibre when it came to golf &#8230; although one of us was more apt to flinging balls into bushes.)<br />
Dinner was the hard part. We strolled right down the main strip without finding anything decent. We kept walking right until we were at the other end, checked out the Pentiction Resort, and finally settled on Mambo&#8217;s, the Italian eatery overlooking the lake.<br />
Dinner was supplemented by a large pitcher of sangria, but was (so I&#8217;m told) bland overall. My risoto wasn&#8217;t too bad, but the others&#8217; meals weren&#8217;t great. Dessert more than made up for it. While Lisa and Miran shared a tiramisu, Allison and I shared a meringue and vanilla ice cream platter with (real) whip cream and strawberries. Very tasty.<br />
We opted to skip the Relativity discussion that night, and made directly for bed. Getting home, I suddenly realised that Allison&#8217;s sunglass case was missing the sunglasses. Somehow, since the time Allison had given me her sunglasses (magnetic clip-ons for her regular glasses) at the mini-golf, I had managed to lose them.<br />
As you can imagine, I felt a bit like a heel that night&#8230;<br />
Mother Nature was annoyed &#8212; because we&#8217;d been moving around so much, she hadn&#8217;t been able to put clouds over us properly. She figured she&#8217;s do the job right on Sunday, though &#8212; she blanketed the entire province with clouds. And so our trip home would be a dark one.<br />
After quick checks of the mini-golf, Mambo&#8217;s, Penticon Resort, and all points in between for the missing sunglasses, I resolved to be less the cost of the replacements, and we headed towards home.<br />
Instead of the usual Coquihalla route, we tried taking Highway 3 (aka the Crow Foot trail, or some such name). After going up and down about a hundred times over the next few hours, we decided that all trips to the Okanagan would take place via the Coquihalla.<br />
Depression set back in once we reached Hope. The clouds were dark and oppressive, and the landscape looked its usual bleak green. After fighting our way through Lower Mainland morons, we pulled into home and rested from our weary trip.<br />
Ironically enough, today is full of the S-word I dare not speak, for fear of jinxing it again. With luck, it&#8217;ll hang on for a while longer&#8230;</p>

		<p>10 years.<br />
[[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Leaving Canada|I can&#8217;t believe it has been 10 years.]]<br />
On 30 June 1989, I departed for the first of what would become a string of interesting journeys into the unknown. This was my first trip out of North America, and my first trip as an Observer.<br />
I can&#8217;t help but be somewhat reflective upon the arrival of this date. 10 years, no matter who you are, is a long period of time. A lot of things can happen in 10 years &#8230; certainly that is true for me.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I&#8217;m not about to bombard you with a list of the things that have happened to me &#8212; that would be grounds for Amnesty International to boycott me for human rights violations.<br />
10 years ago, I left Canada as a naive teenager, ready to take on the world without fear, not really knowing what the outside world was like. I learned a few things on that trip, but what surprised me most were the things I learned about myself. 10 years later, I&#8217;m still surprising myself, each and every day.<br />
I suppose when I stop being surprised, I&#8217;ll stop living&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen many changes in myself, even over the past five years. Most of my friends and family have seen these changes. If you don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t changed, just remember what I was like when:<br />
a) I was in high school.<br />
b) You first met me.<br />
(For those of you who have met me within the past two years, you might not have really noticed much. So take my word for it. I&#8217;m certain those who have known me a while will back me up.)<br />
The next obvious question is: What&#8217;s in store for the next 10 years? Who knows&#8230; it could be anything. Always in motion, is the future. It&#8217;s hard to see, tough to grasp, nearly impossible to predict. That&#8217;s what I find interesting about it &#8212; the inability to classify it properly. It scares some people, frustrates others. For me, it&#8217;s another challenge to overcome.<br />
Today, the Observer is 10 years old, and is ready to enter his decade of development. With luck, the Observer will keep me young when I start getting old (particularly important, since my birthday comes up in a couple of weeks).<br />
Tomorrow, Allison and I are off to scare the inhabitants of the Okanagan. You&#8217;ll hear about it on Monday.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, I did something a little different than usual. I went to Calgary.<br />
Alone.<br />
Well, not totally alone. I went to visit Stuart, who I had only seen for a whopping six hours at Christmas. Ideally, I would have also visited Therese, but she was off in Halifax on a conference, and visiting her sister. Also visiting that weekend was Jay, one of Stuart&#8217;s friends from college, whom I had come to know quite well.<br />
It was becoming the &#8220;Boy&#8217;s Weekend&#8221;.<br />
The original intention behind all this was to get together to work on a script that Stuart and Jay had been working on extensively, that I had started to contribute to a few months ago. The weekend happened to coincide with the release of Star Wars: Episode 1. Lucky us.<br />
When I arrived at Gate C34 at the airport, I noticed that there was a significantly larger number of people than there should be for a a flight not due to board for 40 minutes, let alone depart for an hour. It turned out that the flight before mine (also going to Calgary) was late.<br />
Quickly deducing that my flight would be late arriving in Calgary, I decided to try playing my cards. I walked up to the desk and asked one of the two attendants if the flight leaving was full. When she told me it wasn&#8217;t, I asked if it was possible to change my flight from the 19:40 flight to the 18:30 flight (it ended up being the 19:00 by the time it actually got going).<br />
A few minutes later, I was seated next to a window, waiting to get moving.<br />
Luckily for me, timing was everything that evening. Jay arrived a couple of hours ahead of me, so he and Stuart had gone out for dinner. Arriving early, I attempted to call Stuart&#8217;s thinking he might be there. He wasn&#8217;t. My next task was to have him paged.<br />
A moment after the page went out, I saw Jay and Stuart walking across the baggage claim floor. The weekend had begun.<br />
We retreated to Stuart&#8217;s apartment and watched &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, after engaging in a debate about where John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) appears in the movie. We were unsuccessful in our search. (Apparently he&#8217;s a Rebel &#8212; I mistakenly thought he was an Imperial.)<br />
The following morning, we headed out into the partially cloudy and somewhat rainy Calgary. Following breakfast at Denny&#8217;s (which left Jay and I feeling a bit odd for most of the day), we traipsed about the downtown before finally ending up at Eau Claire Market, where we indulged ourselves on video games. We were killing time. We were seeing Star Wars that night, so we couldn&#8217;t really go anywhere without coming back late.<br />
After a very small lunch, a couple of beers, and an IMAX movie later, we headed out towards the south end of Calgary. You really get an idea of how big Calgary actually is when you find it takes almost an hour to get from downtown to the south end. (Of course, we were driving through rush hour traffic, so that&#8217;s to be somewhat expected.)<br />
We were not alone in our vigil &#8212; several of Stuart and Therese&#8217;s friends were also attending the affair.<br />
We lined up just before 8pm in anticipation of the 10:10pm show. And just so you&#8217;re aware, there were others in the line before us &#8212; we weren&#8217;t the most desperate.<br />
The atmosphere once we got into the theatre was like waiting for a concert to start. Lots of talking and laughing &#8230; even a beach ball that was flung around the room (at least until the management took it away; we booed the usher for ruining our fun).<br />
It was an odd feeling, watching a new Star Wars movie. I couldn&#8217;t honestly tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen the original trilogy. We&#8217;ll just leave at &#8220;a lot&#8221;. We actually had to read the introductory text as it scrolled by. Our excitement was uncontrolled because, as Stuart put it, we didn&#8217;t know exactly what was going to happen in the next moment.<br />
A little over two hours later, we emerged from the theatre, mostly wired from some of the things we had seen. It was a good introduction to a long story (something that a lot of people were forgetting), with a lot of great action. We dreamed of many a lightsabre duel that night&#8230;<br />
The following morning, we decided we would head into the mountains. Jay had never been to the mountains, and wanted to see them up close. The weather was good, so we opted to take the day amongst the snowy caps of the Rockies.<br />
Before leaving Calgary, we picked up a friend of Jay&#8217;s who had moved to Calgary a year earlier, Kevin. Stuart knew Kevin through Jay, so I became the odd person out. Luckily, Kevin and I got along well, so it was a briefly-felt feeling.<br />
Following a quick lunch at Pete&#8217;s Drive-In, we hauled the hour and a half into the mountains. Jay (who had bought a camera that morning so he could take pictures) almost sounded like a little kid as he clicked away with his camera, recording the imagery for posterity.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Banff, although we were going first to Lake Lorna. Kevin quickly asked if any of us have been to Morraine Lake, to which the three of us all replied &#8220;no&#8221;. A third destination was added to the list.<br />
As we drove along, we discussed a great many things, including the things we would do once we finally got to Banff. We even discussed the pronounciation of Banff. Technically, it is &#8220;banff&#8221;. It quickly degraded to &#8220;bamf&#8221;. One of us saying &#8220;banff&#8221; or &#8220;bamf&#8221; was followed by three &#8220;bamf&#8221;s.<br />
Guys do weird things. Accept it.<br />
On the way to Morraine Lake, we noticed something. Snow. Yeah, I know, that sounds really dumb. But there was a lot more snow up there than we expected. This led to, of course, a snowball fight.<br />
It was short-lived (snowballs are really cold on unprotected hands).<br />
For those of you who don&#8217;t remember Morraine Lake (and yes, all you Canadians have seen it before), find an old CDN$20 bill. Flip it over. Voila! Morraine Lake. Didn&#8217;t even know it was that close to Lake Louise.<br />
The snow there was pretty deep, almost burying the sign that describes the significance of the area. Luckily, a lot of people had been there before us, so we could walk across the snow without falling in. This was a good thing for me, because in all my haste to pack for Calgary, I forgot to bring shoes. All I had were my sandals.<br />
Of course, this didn&#8217;t stop me from doing dumb things, like climbing the rock pile at the head of the lake with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. (Luckily, I have good sandals that grip almost anything, and the rocks were bare.)<br />
I was strange seeing Lake Louise again. The last time was a year and a half ago, when Gerry and I had stopped off on our way to Vancouver. Snow covered most of the mountains around the lake, and the lake itself still bore a sheet of ice. I felt sorry for Jay, not being able to witness the greeny-blue lake for himself.<br />
We wandered about the Chateau for a while, debated on crashing a wedding (again, it&#8217;s a guy thing; but don&#8217;t worry, we wouldn&#8217;t actually do such a thing &#8230; without good reason, that is), and eventually left for Banff (bamf).<br />
The townsite of Banff (bamf) hadn&#8217;t changed much in the year since I last visited (with Allison). After Stuart pulled into a well-hidden free parking spot (something that I wish I&#8217;d seen before), we proceeded to invade the downtown.<br />
It seems that Banff (bamf) was also invaded by a squadron of Air Cadets &#8212; they were everywhere. On every corner, and usually scattered about the middle of each block. It almost seemed Dickensian; I expected to see a military Fagin lurking around the corners.<br />
We wandered up Banff (bamf) Ave. towards the Park Administration building, then came down the other side. We stopped into various shops, but I abstained from buying anything &#8212; nothing there that really interested me. Jay and Kevin got sucked into a fudge shop where they indulged their sweet teeth. Tasty stuff, but it made my incisors vibrate.<br />
Finally, it was time for dinner (we really hadn&#8217;t eaten yet), so we headed towards St. James Gate, an Irish pub that Stuart recommended. As we headed over, we realised that we weren&#8217;t too far from Banff&#8217;s (bamf) movie theatre.<br />
It was playing Star Wars.<br />
They still had tickets.<br />
We figured popcorn would tie us over until we could get something else later.<br />
Emerging two hours later, hopped up on a heap of adrenaline from the lightsabre duels (yeah, we focused on that a lot), we went to dinner. A nice lamb stew and an Irish ale really hit the spot.<br />
After dinner, we ended up having to make a hard decision. Banff (bamf) is a great place to have fun. We thought we might stay the night, grab a hotel, and drive back in the morning. But then the little party-pooper in me thought about the plans for the next day &#8212; Drumheller. Driving from Banff (bamf) to Calgary and then to Drumheller wasn&#8217;t exactly something I wanted to do. It seemed it wasn&#8217;t something Stuart or Jay wanted to do either.<br />
The next time we&#8217;re in Banff (bamf), we&#8217;re spending the night, even if it means eight people crammed into a room.<br />
We arrived in Calgary an hour later, initially at a loss for something to do. We ended up downtown at a pub called &#8220;The Barley Mill&#8221;, where we swapped jokes, movie quotes, and work-related annoyances, quaffed a couple pints, and listened to some really great jazz.<br />
We got up a bit later the next morning, showered, hit Safeway to get hot dogs and buns, and headed out to Drumheller. I hadn&#8217;t been to Drumheller before, and really wanted to know what that area of Alberta was like. Jay hadn&#8217;t been there before either (he hadn&#8217;t been to Alberta before), and was excited about the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.<br />
It was a long drive. At least, it felt like a long drive. In reality, it probably wasn&#8217;t anything overly lengthy, but the heat and lack of features (it is the Prairies, after all) made it seem longer. Finally, the flatness gave way to an almost Grand Canyon-like valley (albeit significantly shallower), and the city of Drumheller.<br />
Drumheller is one of these strange cities that base their entire existence on one thing. Usually, that one thing is a resource (i.e. a mine). In this case, it&#8217;s dinosaurs. I&#8217;m really curious to know what would happen to Drumheller if the Tyrell had been built somewhere else.<br />
Our first stop was at McMullen Island, a small park where we had lunch. Then it was off to stare at Mr. T-Rex.<br />
I&#8217;ve been to a few museums now in Alberta, and I will say that they have some of the best ones I&#8217;ve ever been to. It&#8217;s really quite impressive. It&#8217;s not just a few piles of bones for you to stare at &#8212; they purposely lead you through exhibits leading to the rise of the dinosaur. Finally, by the time you reach the actual exhibits, you understand why the dinosaurs came to be.<br />
The museum works of the theory of evolution. You start with the single-celled organisms, progressing to the primitive ocean life. Then it&#8217;s on to the first plants on land, followed by the first land creatures. You start seeing the proto-dinosaurs, finally landing in a large room full of T-Rexes, triceratops, and Albertosauri.<br />
But the exhibits do not stop there &#8212; they continue on the evolution through the extinction of the dinosaur and rise of the mammal. They show you the birth of the sabre-toothed cats, the mammoths, and then take you to the ultimate mammal exhibit &#8230; the gift shop. Think about it &#8212; where else can you see the ultimate mammal in their natural environment?<br />
Returning to the outside, we wandered about the trails near the museum, looking at the rock strata that form the valley the museum sits in, the strata that contains the bones of dinosaurs appearing in the museum. Before hitting the trails, though, we endulged on some frozen treats to try and counteract the 30-someodd degree heat.<br />
A few times, as we walked about the rolling hills, we could hear good ol&#8217; Prairie Silence. For those of you who haven&#8217;t visited the Prairies and parked yourself in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the machines that make the noise we hear every day of our lives, you&#8217;ll never really know what it was like 100 years ago. The silence is truly deafening. (For reference, the only place I&#8217;ve ever been that was quieter was 150 feet below ground in a cave.)<br />
A short drive east from Drumheller took us to the Hoodoos. These are short clumps of rocks that have crowns. The crowns are make from less-soluable rock; they remain mostly untouched while the rocks beneath erode away. It makes for an interesting sight.<br />
Stuart, Jay, and I (mostly Jay and I) hiked to the top of the hill to see what we could see. There&#8217;s a lot out there.<br />
Another thing there was a lot of was sun &#8212; and I got a lot of it. Luckily, not so much to get a sun burn, but enough that my skin felt warm to the touch (even in the shade), and I really wished I had brought sun screen.<br />
Coming down the hill was a little harder than going up. Trying not to lose one&#8217;s footing when wearing sandals is a bit of a challenge, especially when the ground is crumbly. I slid a short distance down the slope, but quickly regained by footing.<br />
We stopped briefly at the Rosedale Suspension Bridge, put in place by the Star Mine company. The mines closed down in the 50&#8217;s, but the bridge continues to draw tourists. Rebuilt a few times since it&#8217;s original installation, the Suspension Bridge now features sturdy wooden towers and a steel grate floor.<br />
After stopping briefly to obtain liquid refreshment (we were quite thirsty by that point), we headed back towards Calgary. The drive back was surprisingly faster than the drive out, despite the fact that we ended up at the south end of the city, and had to travel for about 10 minutes along the Trans Canada to get back in.<br />
Stuart drove through the north of Calgary on our way back to his apartment, allowing me to see what the outskirts of the city look like. I cannot understand why anyone would want to live that far out. You might as well be living in High River for Airdale for all it really matters.<br />
We rented a movie (Rocketman &#8230; a surprisingly funny movie) and ordered Chinese. After the movie ended, we went out for a walk to a local sports bar, where we dove back into the movie script again.<br />
On the following morning, we headed out in search of Darth Maul action figures. Unfortunately, a few million people got there ahead of us. Both Toys &#8216;R Us and the Zellers we checked (not to mention the Bay) had their stocks depleted. Not a total surprise&#8230;<br />
Stuart took us downtown to his office, to show off his little piece of the advertising world. His company (Parallel) does some pretty amazing stuff &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s office is plastered with a lot of that amazing work. There are people whose abilities impress me &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s talent just plain frightens me.<br />
I remember his work when I was in high school. When I look back on his cartoony past and then look at the work he produces now, I admittedly get envious. He&#8217;s done very well on his skill, and it&#8217;s brought him many good things.<br />
We drove around Calgary for a little while, fairly aimlessly (we weren&#8217;t in any rush to go anywhere). We drove by Big Rock Brewery, for whom Stuart had done quite a bit of work. (Those of you in the Calgary area might see the billboards for &#8220;Kold&#8221; or the new Big Rock Brewery trucks with the beer bottles on the side &#8230; that&#8217;s Stuart&#8217;s handiwork.)<br />
At least some people get to see their work on public display. (For the record, Jay&#8217;s working on a kid&#8217;s cartoon show. He&#8217;ll get to see his work on TV.)<br />
As we began to drift in the direction of the airport, a sudden pang of guilt began to wash over me. In the hectic flow of the weekend, I had neglected to contact my relatives. As we were in the north-east anyway, I asked if we could quickly pop by my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home.<br />
I had been there twice before. I knew roughly where it was. But where I couldn&#8217;t remember the exact road to take us into their subdivision, Stuart did. He&#8217;d been there once.<br />
Stuart&#8217;s got a good road memory. (It also helps that he lives in the same city, and IKEA&#8217;s in the same area.)<br />
I got lucky, catching them after they had arrived home from camping. From Drumheller. The previous day. It&#8217;s truly a wonder that we didn&#8217;t run into each other over the course of the day.<br />
We talked for a while, while Jay put Maggie (my aunt and uncle&#8217;s dalmatian) into total submission. Jay&#8217;s got a way with dogs. Jennifer (my cousin) came tearing through the room at one point. She was about a foot taller than the last time I&#8217;d seen her, with shorter hair, and new braces. She smiled, said &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then tore back out of the room.<br />
<em>Sigh.</em> I remember being that age.<br />
Before long, we had to leave, and headed to the airport. Jay&#8217;s flight was before mine, and we didn&#8217;t want him to miss it. My flight wasn&#8217;t for an hour after his, so I would have time to kill.<br />
We bade Jay farewell as he disappeared behind the security wall and eventually onto Toronto. Stuart and I turned to dinner at the Harvey&#8217;s, before it was my turn to depart.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to friends, especially those that mean a lot in your life.<br />
Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see more of my friends this summer. Exactly when I&#8217;ll see them is a completely different issue. But with luck, it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our long weekend started Thursday night, when Allison&#8217;s company decided to hold an employee appreciation event at Metropolis (an entertainment-centric mall a couple of blocks from our apartment). Interlogic was springing for two hours of video games at Sega Playdium, and then dinner at the Rainforest Cafe.<br />
We didn&#8217;t find out about these plans until Wednesday night, so I was unable to make the video games (already having made plans to the &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; with some of my co-workers). However, I made an effort to drop by for dinner.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d met Allison&#8217;s new co-workers, and most of them seemed very nice. Claire, in particular, was extremely cordial &#8212; but since she&#8217;s the HR manager, I guess that&#8217;s to be expected.<br />
When we returned home, we made our final decision to go to Victoria for the weekend. We had tentative plans for some time, but we based our final decision to go on the fact that Allison&#8217;s grandmother was in the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria. Her grandmother had been the focal point of the Collins/Vailmont Easter for about 30 years, and it just seemed wrong not to come over and cheer her up.<br />
(As you may recall, we were in Nanaimo last Easter, engaged in Easter egg hunts in the grandparent&#8217;s yard. This would be the first year in about three decades where the hunt would not happen.)<br />
Early Friday morning, we hauled ourselves out of bed, and hit the road to Tsawwassen. Because of the Easter weekend, BC Ferries were running trips every hour, instead of every two hours, which was the norm. This was good for us, since we didn&#8217;t need to worry about missing a sailing &#8230; which we did.<br />
Arriving about ten minutes too late to make the 10:00 sailing, we parked the car and opted for a late breakfast &#8212; pizza. But this was no ordinary pizza, it was *breakfast* pizza: Eggs, onions, ham, green peppers, cheese, but no tomato sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, and fairly expensive. If they made announcements, it would go something like this:<br />
&#8220;Your attention, please. BC Ferries is happy to charge you exceedingly high prices for low-quality food that you will buy because you are hungry from trying to get here on time not to miss a sailing, or your children are begging you into submission&#8230;&#8221;<br />
We made the 11:00 sailing with no trouble.<br />
We sailed across on the Spirit of British Columbia, the largest short-distance ferry in the fleet (another larger ferry carts passengers up the coast, which is an overnight trip). It&#8217;s a massive vessel, about the size of a small cruise ship. It makes the trip fairly enjoyable &#8230; at least if you don&#8217;t suffer from motion sickness.<br />
Procuring a seat in the corner of the cafeteria, I ran cover by buying some snack food while Allison worked. BC Ferries doesn&#8217;t take kindly to people sucking up table space, so I made an effort to make them think we were eating &#8230; just really really slowly.<br />
Arriving in Victoria, we found it was raining. We had hoped that the weather would be nice for a change, but the generally poor weather was following us around. And no, before you think it, one does not get used to continually bad weather; one gets increasingly irritable.<br />
After a short drive into Victoria, we headed over to the Royal Jubilee Hospital to check in with the family elders. After parking, we wandered inside, and attempted to find Allison&#8217;s parents. We knew they were there &#8212; Allison&#8217;s Aunt Robin drives a very recognisable car.<br />
Luckily for us, we ran into Robin on the second floor, while attempting to find the washroom. Allison&#8217;s grandmother was pleased to see us, as were her parents. We visited briefly as a pair, then ducked into the TV room.<br />
We stayed at the hospital until around 6:00 or so, at which time we headed over to Robin&#8217;s apartment for dinner.<br />
We slept on the floor that night, a probably-not-so-great idea. I woke with a stiffness bordering on rigor mortis, Allison not better off. But we grinned and bore it, and had a leisurely breakfast with Robin, Allison&#8217;s parents, and her grandfather.<br />
The morning was significantly brighter than the previous day, the sun having actually shone through for a change. After a quick visit to the hospital, we opted for a tour of Victoria. Okay, maybe not *really* a tour &#8212; we had been there before, after all &#8212; but it was a good excuse to go out.<br />
We drove downtown, parking on a side street near the Eaton Centre. We had only an hour (the parking meter went no further) to wander about. So we wandered &#8230; right into Roger&#8217;s Chocolates.<br />
Roger&#8217;s is a mainstay in parts of BC &#8212; it&#8217;s an old company, specialising in some very tasty treats. It&#8217;s like Laura Secord back east &#8230; only better. Our mission was to obtain Easter chocolates for the family &#8212; this was not going to be a typical Easter, so we thought it better that we make an effort to do something special.<br />
After our romp through the chocolate shop, we walked around the harbour area, wandering into The Empress hotel. We checked out the prices of the lunch menus, suffered sticker shock, and proceeded back outside again.<br />
After moving the car to a less time-dependent location (a very cheap parking garage), we hopped out to find some lunch. We headed into an Indian restaurant, and promptly started inquring about the soup of the day. That&#8217;s when we found out that there was no lunch special on weekends, which meant the prices more than doubled. We made a hasty exit and went into another Indian restaurant two doors down.<br />
Being a beautiful day, we spent a fair bit of time wandering along the walkway around the inner harbour. You could hear the mainstay bagpiper from across the harbour with no difficulty.<br />
Walking around towards the parliment buildings, we passed a congregation of people, surrounding a small brass band, and a boat covered with flowers. Our first impression was that someone was being married. It wasn&#8217;t until a while later that it occurred to us that it was actually a memorial service.<br />
The walkways were packed with people, all relishing in the bright sunshine. (It was so bright that I nearly got a sunburn!) But the temperature was still cool, so only the brave (or the stupid) wore shorts. And yes, I did have a pair with me &#8212; it was still too cool for my liking.<br />
Buskers were about, too. We saw one busker whose act we remembered from the year before. There were a few differences, which made the overall show pretty good, certainly worth the two dollars Allison gave the busker.<br />
On the way back to the car, we checked for the availability of a hotel &#8212; we weren&#8217;t too keen on staying on the floor for a second night. We found one hotel room left for $30, and promptly headed off before we lost it.<br />
The Friendship Inn has been in Victoria since the dawn of time, or sometime roughly near it. The buildings are old, the rooms musty, and the mattresses somewhat curved. But for $30, I wasn&#8217;t about to complain any. Well, maybe except for the people &#8220;living&#8221; next door. We didn&#8217;t leave our things, opting to bring them back with us.<br />
If you go just west of Victoria, you&#8217;ll run into Esquimalt. Dependng on who you ask, Esquimalt is either a scary, run-down, naval base-influenced town; or it&#8217;s a fairly nice little suburb. I personally vote for the latter. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; there are some seedy areas (but then, even Oakville has its seedy areas).<br />
We drove about, looking at the houses, even looking into an open house out of curiousity, just to see what was about. We drove up and down, back and forth, eventually finding ourselves back in Victoria again.<br />
So we drove up and down, back and forth, until we found ourselves driving along Dallas Road, heading into Oak Bay. We had driven along this route before the previous year, only it was Allison driving, and it was at night. It pretty much ended the same way, with us passing along the north side of UVic trying to find our way back into Victoria.<br />
We returned to the hospital towards dinnertime, to check on everyone milling around Allison&#8217;s grandmother. We were surprised to find Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister) in attendence, and we had to do a double take when we saw Brenna and Cameron (Allison&#8217;s cousins, who live in Parksville). They were on their way back to Nanaimo (and Parksville). We nearly passed each other in the hall.<br />
Dinner was at Robin&#8217;s again, only instead of the home-cooked meal we ate the night before, we had Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
As a child, I remember loving Kentucky Fried Chicken. Of course, as a child, I could eat whatever I wanted without any consequences. As an adult, I am convinced that KFC is evidence of Satan&#8217;s existence. Allison and I both regretted dinner&#8230;<br />
On the way back to our hotel that night, I noticed something a little strange &#8212; the car seemed to be a bit louder. In fact, it vibrated a bit more, too. In the back of my mind, I knew what the problem was. In the front of my mind, I was denying it with every ounce of my strength.<br />
The next morning, the truth finally decided it would not be contained. On the way out to have something to eat, the muffler broke loose. Well, partially loose &#8212; there was a large rubber bracket holding the muffer to the car. As Allison&#8217;s mother would point out later, every time my car and the island have anything to do with one another, I have problems with the car.<br />
Pulling off to the side, I whipped out my trusty bungee cord, and lashed the stupid muffler to the underside of the car. Ideally, I would&#8217;ve just taken the muffler off, but that rubber connector just taunted me.<br />
We headed back to Vancouver in early afternoon, realising that if we hurried, we could get to Granville Island before it closed. (It was this revelation that made Allison convinced that she couldn&#8217;t live anywhere outside of Vancouver &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t get to the Market whenever she wanted.)<br />
A good weekend. It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had a good weekend. I mean a weekend where we didn&#8217;t have to worry about being rained on. Believe me &#8212; that&#8217;s a long time.<br />
After a leisurely rising Saturday morning, I went out to get my muffler fixed. That was my first mistake &#8212; I found out that the entire exhaust system was about two minutes from giving out. $200 later, I was out getting my car washed. That was my second mistake &#8212; Allison wanted me home earlier than that to clean. As soon as I got in, we were running back out again.<br />
We were going to spend the afternoon at Granville Island (yes, we go there a lot) looking around the market and buying food for dinner. It was a good way to spend the afternoon.<br />
Sunday started off even more beautifully than Saturday. It was warm (we opened all the windows for the first time this year) and sunny &#8212; the day was just waiting to be enjoyed. So we spent an hour cleaning. Don&#8217;t laugh &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how good that made us feel.<br />
As we were working, Allison heard a news story on the TV, talking about how the Alberta Report (a group of ultra right-wing wackos from Alberta &#8212; although there are those who think that *anyone* from Alberta is an ultra right-wing wacko) was going to take their message to Toronto, which the Report viewed as where most of the evils in Canada came from.<br />
It was then that it suddenly hit me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t view Toronto (or Oakville, for that matter) as home. In fact, it seemed somewhat foreign to me. It was no longer a place that was comforting, familiar &#8212; it was very distant, cold, disparate from everything I could think of.<br />
It was with a great and sudden shock that I realised that I have become a BCer: I complain about the rain and the cold (despite the fact that it&#8217;s not that cold), I wear sandals as often as possible (I&#8217;m wearing them right now), I can&#8217;t stand the NDP government (but will probably vote for them because all the alternatives are far worse), and view the east as an entirely different place. Canada is certainly different when you&#8217;re not in the centre of the universe anymore&#8230;<br />
At any rate, after our quick spring clean, we jumped in the car, and ran out to enjoy the day. We ended the day with a quick pasta dish, which for some unknown reason, made the whole weekend complete.</p>
