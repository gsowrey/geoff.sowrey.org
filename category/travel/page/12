		<p>Today was a good day. Finally.<br />
There&#8217;s nothing quite like the feeling of finally overcoming a problem that&#8217;s kept you up a night, sent you to perhaps the dullest city in mid-eastern America, had you eating mediocre food for a week, and put massive (albeit temporary) dents in your credit cards.<br />
It&#8217;s also good to know that I didn&#8217;t waste my weekend. The problems, not quite all, but most of them, are gone. All the work that I poured into this handy little laptop, not to mention some great backup from Calgary, solved our quandaries. The site&#8217;s working (mostly), and after tomorrow, we&#8217;ll be able to say that the site is solid, and I can finally go home.<br />
I met with John today. He&#8217;s our (Critical Mass&#8217;) account manager for our client. He&#8217;s not much older than me &#8212; I figure 30, tops. Probably from a business school. But he&#8217;s good with clients, and seems pretty good at fighting fires. He was here for his bi-monthly meeting with the client. He knows this city well.<br />
We had an interesting chat after work, over dinner at the Fifth and Vine, an eatery in the corner of the hotel. I gotta tell ya &#8212; he&#8217;s a great guy. He saw the client in pretty much the same way I do. Not to mention the contractors. I got a lot of positive feedback &#8212; he was glad I came. Although not the best candidate, I was good enough to convince some of the contractors that Critical Mass isn&#8217;t all pretty front-ends, and that we do know how to solve hard problems.<br />
Whether or not that keeps going is anyone&#8217;s guess&#8230;<br />
Tomorrow is coding and testing, and then I&#8217;m outta here on Thursday. With luck, I&#8217;ll be at work Friday morning.<br />
If I&#8217;m not, I might start looking for an apartment down here. It&#8217;ll certainly be cheaper than these hotels&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate this city. And Memorial Day. The two of them combined? Well, let me tell you&#8230;<br />
I figured I&#8217;d stay in today and get some work done. Fine, no problem. Or so I thought. I got up later than I&#8217;d planned (probably because I&#8217;d stayed up so late), and so skipped breakfast (which I&#8217;ve done almost every day since I got here). I figured that I&#8217;d make it up with a nice sub.<br />
So I thought.<br />
In Canada, whenever we have a holiday, it&#8217;s a good excuse to go shopping. I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; nearly everything that can be open is usually open. There are exceptions, but more often than not, you can at least find a restaurant, or a Subway, to get a meal.<br />
Not in Cincinnati.<br />
It&#8217;s locked down tighter than a drum. Even the bars are closed. What&#8217;s with that? Since when don&#8217;t Americans want to get drunk on a National Holiday? I thought that was a stereotype, for crying out loud!<br />
Yes, I&#8217;m annoyed.<br />
After wandering around downtown for about an hour, I found ONE open store or restaurant. Arby&#8217;s. I won&#8217;t touch Arby&#8217;s for all the roast beef in England. Can&#8217;t do it. Won&#8217;t do it. I hate Arby&#8217;s. I&#8217;ve eaten there twice, and hated it both times.<br />
So I figured I&#8217;d eat at one of the hotel&#8217;s restaurants. They closed at 1:50pm. They don&#8217;t open again until 5pm. What the heck kind of service is that??<br />
Oh yeah, there&#8217;s room service &#8230; if you want to pay US$15 for a lousy hamburger. For US$15, I can get a bottomless soft drink, a beer (a wheat beer, not some mega-swill), a huge gourmet hamburger (made to order) with cheese and bacon, fries, and a caesar salad. That&#8217;s at the Rock Bottom. I&#8217;d just as soon go there &#8230; but it&#8217;s closed.<br />
So I&#8217;m eating a Snickers bar and holding out until 6pm.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait to go home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today was my day off. It didn&#8217;t start that way &#8212; I was figuring on getting a lot of work in, but as I went out to scout for lunch, I decided that the day was nice enough that I would take a little walk. My logic says that if I take today off, I can work my keister off for the next 36 hours and still get the job done and get a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
In theory, at least.<br />
My goal was the Cincinnati Museum Center. It sounded like a really neat place to check out, and it was about the only thing in walking distance that I wanted to see.<br />
I walked up to 9th Street before heading west. Along the way, I passed examples of architecture from just about every period since the mid-to-late 1800s. Gerry would love this city.<br />
The weather was threatening rain, amidst bursts of sunshine. The forecast was for thunderstorms, but I never heard even so much as a slight rumble. Heck, it barely rained in the entire time I was walking about. Which was good, because I had neither an umbrella or a raincoat. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to go anywhere where I would be horribly out of place showing up soaked.<br />
According to the maps I&#8217;d read, all I had to do was cross I-75 on 9th Street, turn onto Gest Road, and walk up to Western Road. Unfortunately, maps seldom match reality. For starters, 9th Street doesn&#8217;t actually cross I-75 &#8212; 8th Street does. Although 8th Street doesn&#8217;t actually connect with the road that crosses I-75. Doesn&#8217;t make sense, does it? Well, considering the city has no movie theatres downtown and no stores open past 9pm (the Subway closes at 5pm on weekends!), it fits the pattern.<br />
When you get to the other side of the I-75, you&#8217;ll find that Gest doesn&#8217;t actually intersect with the road you&#8217;re walking on. It&#8217;s pseudo-parallel. And Western? I don&#8217;t think it meets Gest, either &#8230; although I could have just missed it without realizing.<br />
You can see the Cincinnati Museum Center even before you&#8217;ve reached the other side of the bridge. It&#8217;s that big. It took me about ten minutes to get there from the bridge, and when I got there, I realized that I had another five minutes of having to walk around so I could actually get in. (I came down towards the side, which has a road that goes under the parking lot.)<br />
The Cincinnati Museum Center is also known as Cincinnati Union Station. It was built in 1931 to handle the massive passenger rail traffic that used to run through the city. The station was huge. Its centre is a huge quarter sphere, with the flat side facing the front. The curved portion forms the massive rotunda of the complex. It&#8217;s a very dramatic art deco style. Gerry would love this building. So would Stuart, I think.<br />
I like the art deco style. I&#8217;d even go so far as to say I&#8217;m an art deco revivalist. Maybe it&#8217;s because I think the style is elegant, maybe it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not concrete. Sometimes I think I long for the era that spawned art deco &#8212; the days when rail travel was king, when technology was the newest radio.<br />
Then again, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to write these logs as easily&#8230;<br />
The museum has four exhibits: The Cincinnati Museum in the south wing, the Natural History Museum in the north wing, the Children&#8217;s Museum in the &#8220;basement&#8221;, and an OmnIMAX theatre. Okay, &#8220;exhibits&#8221; is the wrong word &#8212; but museums sounds a little strange.<br />
Actually, there&#8217;s a fifth exhibit &#8212; the building itself. If you go on a weekend, you can get a free tour of Cincinnati Union Station &#8212; when it was railway station. They take you through the various sections that are still in the semi-original state. I caught a part of it when I was waiting in line for the OmnIMAX movie. More on that later.<br />
After purchasing my ticket, I went into the Cincinnati Museum. I figured that I could get through that before the movie at 4:00. The two wings used to be where vehicular traffic came through. It was a place for taxis and &#8220;motor coaches&#8221; (buses) to drop people off and pick people up. They arrived at the north wing (now the Natural History wing), drove under the main structure and picked people up on the south wing (now the Cincinnati Museum exhibit). The driveways are still visible, although now covered in grass.<br />
The first thing you notice when entering the Cincinnati Museum is a massive model of 1940s downtown Cincinnati. Some of the buildings are familiar &#8212; they still stand today. But many are gone, replaced by more modern (although not necessarily more attractive) buildings. One thing that&#8217;s very noticeable is the streetcars (taken out in the 1950s), and the railyard and warehousing district on the waterfront. Today, there are no rails down there, and the only buildings (aside from the highways) are Cinergy Field (home of the Cincinnati Reds) and a new stadium, currently under construction (the future home of the Cincinnati Reds).<br />
I spent about 15 minutes at the model, going through the interactive video, learning more about the city keeping my prisoner. It grew from the copious river traffic that flowed up and down the Ohio River. River travel was so important that the river boat captains wielded strong power over many decisions facing early Cincinnati.<br />
One of those decision was to build a bridge to neighbouring Newport, Kentucky. The captains didn&#8217;t like that idea &#8212; it would hinder their ability to monopolize freight and passenger traffic. But eventually it was built, although Cincinnati took three more years than its neighbour to grant permission. (Their excuse was potential loss of Cincinnati jobs and an increase in runaway slaves.)<br />
The bridge was designed by John A. Roebling, the same person who designed the Brooklyn Bridge. The John A. Roebling bridge, as it&#8217;s now known, is in fact the forefather of the Brooklyn Bridge. The design was later improved for its much more famous descendant.<br />
From there, I walked through a rather large exhibit about Cincinnati&#8217;s wartime efforts. They seem really proud of that. A little too proud, if you ask me. Of course, it might just be part of the Memorial Day festivities (there were vets all over the place).<br />
Then it was into ancient Cincinnati, starting from the arrival of Native Americans. One thing I learned early on was that Cincinnati, the order of officers for whom the city obtained its name, comes from Cincinnatus. Cincinnatus was a Roman general, who came from commoner stock. The officers of the Revolutionary War thought it was an appropriate name to give themselves (&#8220;Cincinnati&#8221; is Latin plural for &#8220;Cincinnatus&#8221;). So I guess in theory, a person from Cincinnati is a Cincinnatus. Hmm, I wonder&#8230;<br />
The exhibit was really quite fascinating. They covered the period of western encroachment into Ohio, from the first explorers, to the founding of Losantiville, the founding of Fort Washington, the Miami Purchase (don&#8217;t ask me what that was &#8212; the Americans seem obsessed with &#8220;purchases&#8221;, and the rising of the modern city that I can&#8217;t seem to escape.<br />
One of the neater parts of the exhibit was a 3/4 scale model of a steamboat, complete with part of original downtown Cincinnati. The exhibit stopped around the turn of the 20th century.<br />
By that time, I thought I should head up, so I wouldn&#8217;t miss the movie. I was about 40 minutes early, so I just camped out around the door. Soon, the tour of Cincinnati Union Station came by. At first, I didn&#8217;t know what it was, but I was offered to join. So I did.<br />
The first stop (for me, and also the last) was at the Amtrak station. Yes, there is an actual operating Amtrak station in this museum. Apparently, the rail travel still has to go through here. Kinda neat, eh?<br />
Once upon a time, it used to be the Men&#8217;s Waiting Room. (There was also a Women&#8217;s Waiting Room.) It featured a lounge, showers (baths for women), smoking room &#8212; everything you needed to freshen up (or wait) for your train. Today, the women&#8217;s room is gone &#8212; it&#8217;s now storage, the showers have been taken out and the door removed, and the decor is plastic overlay instead of wood. But it still features the original flooring and art deco lights.<br />
When we exited the room, the line-up for the movie had grown considerably. I opted to not follow the rest, as I wanted a good seat (this is crucial in an IMAX film).<br />
The movie was &#8220;Amazon&#8221;, and is perhaps one of the better IMAX movies I&#8217;ve seen. It tells the story of how two completely different civilizations (Western, and of the many that live in and around the Amazon basin) look to the Amazon with the same purpose in mind &#8212; saving lives. It didn&#8217;t preach heavily, but it didn&#8217;t really have to &#8212; the need to preserve the Amazon was quite clear. It was the first IMAX movie I&#8217;ve seen that made me queasy. Of course, that might have been due to lack of food.<br />
After lunch, I caved in a bought a disposable camera. I wanted a pictures of the building &#8212; it&#8217;s too nice not to take pictures. Besides, I want to scan them and put them up for all to see.<br />
Afterwards, I went through the Natural History wing. Not nearly as interesting as the Cincinnati Museum, but then again, I knew most of this. They had a few things that I didn&#8217;t expect to see &#8212; a mock-up of a cave (similar to Mammoth Cave, about three hours from here), and a mock-up of a glacier (which according to the museum, stopped just short of here during the last ice age).<br />
The animals that lived here during that time were fascinating. I had never seen a skeleton, let alone a recreation, of a giant beaver. About three times the size of a normal beaver, this beastie could probably have taken down entire trees with a single bite. Big, sharp, pointy teeth.<br />
I left around 5:45, heading back towards downtown. This time I went down Ezzard Charles Drive to Central Parkway, before heading south. I went all the way down to 3rd Street, where I walked over to the John A. Roebling bridge. (One of the weird conditions about building the bridge was that it was not allowed to be in line with any existing Cincinnati streets).<br />
I walked towards the bridge until I got to a staircase that allowed me to get down to the Ohio River. From there, I got a good enough angle to take pictures of the bridge. I returned to the bridge to take a picture from its deck.<br />
Returning to Fountain Square, I partook in a late dinner at the Rock Bottom Brewery again. I was relieved to finally get off my feet &#8212; I&#8217;d been walking for hours, and was quite tired at that point.<br />
Then it was back to my room, and back to work. But at least I got part of a day off.</p>

		<p>Ugh.<br />
It never fails. I get a long weekend, I get lousy weather. I had hoped to go to the Cincinnati Museum today, but the weather kept me indoors. Okay, that sounds like a really stupid statement &#8212; if I&#8217;m going to a museum, why would I care what the weather&#8217;s like?<br />
I want to walk there &#8212; I&#8217;m a little tired of taxis, and I could use the exercise. But it rained for most of the day. It didn&#8217;t clear up until later in the afternoon. A good thing, since I wanted to go out for dinner tonight.<br />
I spent the day working, fixing our client&#8217;s website. I watched movies and coded. I&#8217;m amazed at how much work I got done watching &#8220;Meet Joe Black&#8221;. You really can work for huge periods of time and not miss much in that movie. On the opposite view, I didn&#8217;t get much done during &#8220;The Highlander&#8221;.<br />
Importantly, though, I had breakthroughs. I only wish I were actually in the office to put my theories to the test. But I have to wait until Tuesday. Our client doesn&#8217;t like having strangers run amok in the offices unescorted.<br />
My first meal in Cincinnati that wasn&#8217;t a sub was at the Rock Bottom Brewery, a brew pub in Fountain Square, pretty much right across the street from the Westin. I don&#8217;t much like going to places like that on my own, but I didn&#8217;t have a lot of choice. Besides, Nancy (my project manager) more or less ordered me to get out for dinner at least one night this weekend.<br />
Tomorrow &#8212; more rain. Hence, more work. But Monday&#8217;s supposed to be nice. If I get enough done, I&#8217;ll make an effort to get out and see what I can find. Besides, I&#8217;ll need the air by that point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another day, another hotel. Owing to some strange reason, there seem to be a lot of people coming to Cincinnati. Can&#8217;t really figure out why.<br />
The Omni was completely booked for today when my room was booked on Tuesday. So I moved the next block over to the Westin. Larger room, better bed. Lousier TV selection, though. Oh well, I guess there are trade offs&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m definitely here for the long run. Probably won&#8217;t be escaping this place until Wednesday at the earliest. We&#8217;ve got problems that really have no explanation. Rather annoying, if you ask me. Today was about as effective as Wednesday and Thursday. This weekend is all mine, though. I&#8217;m going to rebuild parts of the site that the contractors did a number on. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t blame them &#8212; completely, anyway &#8212; they did what they had to do. Unfortunately, they aren&#8217;t the best coders in the world when it comes to HTML.<br />
My task this weekend is to correct all the mistakes. Not just theirs, but ours. We (Critical Mass) sent a few files that had a few discrepancies in style. Not a good thing. So I&#8217;m going to spend a lot of time going through every file in the site. There&#8217;s a few, but luckily, not a lot. If I had to do this for, say, the Mercedes Benz site, I&#8217;d be spending the better part of a month doing that.<br />
After work, I took the time to wander through part of downtown Cincinnati. It&#8217;s an interesting city, if only for its idiosyncracities. Its architecture is &#8230; well &#8230; interesting. (Seeing as the city&#8217;s &#8220;interesting&#8221;, I guess that goes hand-in-hand.) The buildings in downtown Cincinnati have more variance in styles than any city I&#8217;ve lived in. This is probably because Cincinnati&#8217;s been around a while, and gone through a lot of changes.<br />
The town of Losantisville was founded in 1788 on the shores of the Ohio River. Two years later, Northwest Territory Commander General Arthur St. Clair renamed the town Cincinnati, in honour of the Society of Cincinnati, an officers&#8217; organization from the Revolutionary War.<br />
Cincinnati&#8217;s location is the nexus of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. This made it a central location for commerce, which naturally attracted people. The mid-1800s saw Cincinnati&#8217;s population grow by 40 percent as a flood newcomers, mostly German immigrants. Steamboat trade and the explosion of the pork-packing industry led to Cincinnati&#8217;s role as the &#8220;Queen City of the West&#8221;. For a time, it was the nation&#8217;s sixth largest city and third-largest manufacturing centre.<br />
Today, the industry that built Cincinnati is gone. In its place are Fortune 500 companies and a lot of smaller companies. The massive factories are gone, or subdivided by smaller companies. The downtown core is completely commercial, which explains its death in the evenings (and my boredom).<br />
Because of Cincinnati&#8217;s past, it has a very interesting present &#8230; at least from an architectural perspective. Most of the buildings downtown are either modern (built within the past 20 years), or from the 1920s to 1940s. There are a few edifices from the 50s, 60s, and 70s &#8212; they&#8217;re not too hard to spot. (Although the Federal Reserve, built in 1972, is quite nice.) Old buildings are well preserved, and easy to find.<br />
Not easy to find are Cincinnati&#8217;s mistakes, and they&#8217;ve made a couple biggies. One of the more interesting ones is Cincinnati&#8217;s attempt at a subway system. The City made the attempt, starting in the 1920s using leftovers from a canal system. A large portion of the system was completed before the Depression brought the project to a screeching halt. Lack of funds and a general trend towards automobile traffic eventually led the subway into abandonment. The tunnels are used for storage, the half-built stations boarded up. Today, hardly anything exists.<br />
Tomorrow, I intend to check out the Cincinnati Museum, an old art deco railway station converted into a museum. But that&#8217;s just part of the day &#8212; the rest will be work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m trapped. Metaphorically speaking, that is.<br />
Today, I effectively did nothing. I spent the day trying to solve problems, but not really accomplishing anything. I started off with a conference call with Critical Mass and a few representatives of our client. We were reviewing the situation I&#8217;ve been dealing with since I arrived.<br />
The meeting wasn&#8217;t too long, and afterwards I felt that those involved had a clearer picture of the situation. This was important from my perspective, since I wasn&#8217;t too sure whether my superiors were wholly confident on sending me down in the first place. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m not trying to blow smoke. But considering my lack of progress, I had to make sure that the others understood that I know what I&#8217;m doing &#8230; sort of.<br />
My major problem is that there&#8217;s nothing I can do directly &#8212; I have to ask others to do it. And if those others aren&#8217;t interested in helping me, well, then I look like a bit of a putz. Not much I can do about it, I&#8217;m afraid.<br />
I struggled through the day, doing what I can, until conference call #2 in the afternoon. Same client, different project. This is the one I started on my second day at Critical Mass. It just so happened that I happened to be in Cincinnati when they needed someone. Convenient, non?<br />
Tomorrow&#8217;s the start of the long weekend here. It basically means that not much work will be done. And considering the past two days of relative inactivity, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m making it out on Sunday. Not unless all the problems disappear tomorrow, and there&#8217;s a chance I can get in on the weekend. I know snowballs that have better chances than that&#8230;<br />
After work here is dull without something to do. I&#8217;ve spent the past couple of hours watching TV. Luckily for me, I get TBS &#8212; I&#8217;ve never seen Enter The Dragon all the way through. First time for everything, I guess. After this is Rumble In The Bronx with Jackie Chan. I suppose Cincinnati isn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
If you can stay in your hotel room all the time, that is.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My alarm went off early this morning. I rose somewhat slowly (I hadn&#8217;t quite adjusted to the time zone), but eventually found my way into the shower. That woke me up enough to get dressed, shave, and prepare my notes for this morning.<br />
First stop was breakfast. Continental was served in the spacious (and opulent) dining area on the lobby floor. I found out shortly thereafter that I&#8217;d be far better off not eating &#8212; at nearly $18, I was quite relieved to know that I could expense it.<br />
I returned quickly to my room to call Corey, my contact at the client site. Corey works for the backend consultant, and would be one of the people I would be working with. I dug out his number and dialled his mobile phone. He asked that I call back &#8212; he was apparently still in transit. On the second call, he gave me directions to the building where I&#8217;d be wreaking havoc trying to fix a broken system.<br />
I&#8217;m working in a small team, all of whom have been slaving away on the installation since February. I feel sorry for them &#8212; given the amount of frustration I felt today alone, I can understand why they don&#8217;t smile a lot.<br />
It took most of the day before I began to understand what was going on. It wasn&#8217;t anything that we (Critical Mass) had done with our code. Nor was it anything that the consultants had done. It was, or at least seemed to be, the server. The software we needed didn&#8217;t appear to be correct. Simple HTML codes were being garbled.<br />
So, problem solved and I get to go home, right? Not quite. There&#8217;s a lot of things that are still unresolved &#8212; most notably the issue of whether or not the server is actually the problem. We don&#8217;t know. I came to that conclusion based on results we were getting from the server and my knowledge of how these things (usually) work. The consultants liked my answer, mostly because they were having so many problems, my hypothesis would explain a large part of it. However, I have yet to put it through the scientific process.<br />
After work, I trudged my way back to the hotel. It was hot. It was humid. I&#8217;d forgotten what it was like &#8212; I&#8217;ve been gone from the East for so long, the sudden rise in temperature (and subsequent decrease in comfort) was a little surprising.<br />
What wasn&#8217;t surprising was the city. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but Cincinnati feels and smells like &#8230; well, an American city. It&#8217;s weird. It&#8217;s the same acrid diesel-infused stench (thankfully not strong) of an industrial city. Which is odd, since Cincinnati isn&#8217;t quite as industrial as it used to be.<br />
Returning to my room, I quickly changed into shorts, and proceeded to figure out what I would do. The answer was quick (and somewhat obvious, at least to those who know me) &#8212; a movie. Specifically, Mission: Impossible 2. (Critical Mass *had* to send me in opening week&#8230;) The hard part was finding a place that actually had the movie.<br />
There are no movie theatres in downtown Cincinnati. I don&#8217;t know why. Makes no sense. The nearest theatre is five miles away &#8230; straight-line distance. It&#8217;s about 10 miles, once you count in all the turns and zigzags. It costs about US$14. So why did I bother? Well, simply put, there ain&#8217;t a heck of a lot to do in downtown Cincinnati.<br />
The taxi driver had no idea where the Showcase Cinema was. I only knew that it was off of Route 562. The driver took off in that direction, while I attempted to narrow down the search. The major problem was that we had no real address, and for the second time since I got here, my cell phone didn&#8217;t want to dial. (A note for you Clearnet users &#8212; it has problems roaming in the States.)<br />
We headed up I-71, looking for the turn-off onto Route 562. The driver&#8217;s instinct took over and he left the highway shortly after turning onto Route 562, into a subdivision. We pulled into a BP station, where he quickly got directions. A scarce five minutes later, we arrived at the Showcase Cinemas.<br />
It was worth it, at least in my opinion. Certainly better than watching TV in my suite all night. And yes, the taxi was expensive, but since I ate about US$5 of food today, and will probably do same tomorrow, it&#8217;ll all eventually balance out.<br />
I hope&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long day.<br />
It all started about a week ago. One of our clients, whom I&#8217;m afraid I cannot mention, had a problem with the website we developed for them. Actually, it wasn&#8217;t the client so much as it was our so-called partner in crime.<br />
Critical Mass typically designs the front-end &#8212; all the pretty pictures and clicky things &#8212; of a website. Typically, someone else does the back-end &#8212; all the junk that deals with the ecommerce and database. This isn&#8217;t our idea &#8212; it&#8217;s usually the client&#8217;s. We don&#8217;t much cotton to that process; it lends to more problems than it&#8217;s worth. That&#8217;s how I ended up here in Cincinnati.<br />
We provided one of our stunning works of art to the client, who then turned it over to the backend developers (whom, again, I cannot mention). The firm is large, and we assumed technically savvy. We should know better.<br />
They fubared the site. Lemme back up &#8212; they tried to merge our site with their backend, and then claimed that our &#8220;monkey s&#8211;t JavaScript&#8221; didn&#8217;t work. That&#8217;s a load of bally-hoo &#8212; we wouldn&#8217;t have shipped it if it didn&#8217;t work. Then we got the email that drove most of us in Web Development off the deep end&#8230;<br />
We develop our sites with the most recent developments in HTML, including JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). One of our favourite tricks is to build everything in &#8220;layers&#8221; &#8212; small pieces we can stack on top of each other. It makes the site very flexible. This technique is what was causing the backend consultants grief.<br />
The backend (using a system called Dynamo) wasn&#8217;t working with our layers (specifically, a tag called a &#8220;DIV&#8221;). So they decided that we could no longer develop using DIV tags, and had to build everything with tables. Uhhhhh, no.<br />
We thought this was a load of crock from the moment we first heard it. We knew that our code was solid &#8212; we&#8217;d built several sites using Dynamo and DIVs, and never had a problem. So we told them that. They didn&#8217;t exactly listen. I wrote up a small quasi-manifesto (with some contributions from Adile, my partner in crime in my first project at Critical Mass). I figure that&#8217;s how I ended up here.<br />
On Friday, just after lunch, Nancy (the account manager for this particular client) drew me aside and asked if I would go to Cincinnati and clear this mess up. Big responsibility. No, I wasn&#8217;t the best choice &#8212; there are others in the company who were far better suited to this problem &#8212; but I was the best choice of the available people.<br />
Simply put, there were about five people Nancy would have sent. Two were far too tied up on projects to pull off. One was, well, we were worried that they would back down and give into the consultant&#8217;s demands to convert the entire site to tables. Another would have been ideal, but would probably get into too many arguments to be truly effective. That left me. Being between projects, and having some experience with Dynamo and DIVs, I got fingered to go.<br />
This morning, I was running around like a madman, trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible. The flight still hadn&#8217;t been booked (nor the hotel), I hadn&#8217;t packed (owing to a lack of a suitably-sized duffel bag), I needed to set up email forwarding, get files copied to the laptop (which had only just returned from Cincinnati), I had to square away rent (just in case I don&#8217;t get back before the beginning of the month), and I had to pay a couple of bills. All that before 11:00.<br />
I left at 11:40 for the airport. The flight was at 2:05 on Northwest Airlines. I would fly from Calgary to Minneapolis/St. Paul, where I&#8217;d catch a connecting flight to Cincinnati. (Oh the joys of the airline hub.) I arrived at Calgary airport in sufficient time to check-in and get lunch.<br />
I&#8217;ve never flown Northwest before. I don&#8217;t like American airlines in general, and I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having to take one. But when given no choice, you take what you&#8217;re given. That&#8217;s why when I found out that my ticket automatically upgraded me to First Class, I didn&#8217;t refuse.<br />
I didn&#8217;t check any bags &#8212; I prefer not to, just so I don&#8217;t have to deal with baggage pick-up at the other end. Customs was fun. The game was &#8220;Let&#8217;s See If We Can Freak Geoff Out&#8221;. The questions came fast and hard, and I responded just as quickly. Then I goofed. When asked for the duration of my stay, I said I hoped to return on Sunday. &#8220;Hoped.&#8221; Bad choice of word. This brought up a whole issue of why I wouldn&#8217;t be coming back on Sunday. That escalated into the purpose of my visit, and what exactly was I doing there. I figured it would snowball into &#8220;Why can&#8217;t an American do this?&#8221; &#8212; luckily, it didn&#8217;t.<br />
The flight was late, by about 30 minutes or so. Soon we were called, and I walked down the gangway to our DC-9. I can&#8217;t tell you the last time I&#8217;d flown in a DC-9, only that it&#8217;s been a very long time. I had 3C, and the adjoining 3A, all to myself. Wow. Big seats. Nice service. Free booze. Too bad I&#8217;m trying not to drink (I get dehydrated enough as it is on planes without having alcohol).<br />
It was about three hours to Minneapolis. During the time, we were served lunch &#8212; a chicken sandwich. But in First Class, the sandwich is nice and hot, with yummy cheese and grilled peppers. It comes with a nice little salad, and an Italian rolled ice cream ball.<br />
I like First Class.<br />
You also get a GLASS glass for your drink, instead of some goofy plastic cup. It really does make a difference.<br />
We arrived in Minneapolis around 5:45pm (local time). I was supposed to go to Gate 7, where I&#8217;d catch my connecting flight at 7:00. So of course, we came in at Gate 64. Figures. I hiked across the airport (and boy, is it a big airport), and found my way to Gate 7. There, I plunked myself down, and continued to teach myself Dynamo. (Not having a manual makes it kinda hard.)<br />
Around 6:30, I began to wonder why Gate 7 didn&#8217;t have any sign up for my flight. Gate 8, which was leaving for Green Bay at 7:15, had its sign up before I got there. I started to wonder. So I asked.<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Yeah, your flight is leaving from Gate Sev&#8230; er, they&#8217;ve moved it.&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;Where to?&#8221; (I already knew the answer. Murphy was standing right behind me.)<br />
Attendant: &#8220;Gate 82.&#8221;<br />
I&#8217;ll tell you one thing &#8212; I&#8217;m glad that I started working out (although I&#8217;ve been a little lax in the past week or two). By the time I got to Gate 82, I was winded. Of course, I was hiking at a serious pace to get there on time.<br />
Flight 8530 was being operated by Mesaba Airlines. I haven&#8217;t heard of &#8217;em, either. Frankly, that worried me, too. But as it turns out, they just operate Northwest&#8217;s regional flights. Supposedly, Cincinnati is regional from Minneapolis.<br />
We flew an RJ-45, er, 85 (sorry, techie joke there). I&#8217;ve never heard of an RJ-85, I don&#8217;t even know who built the silly thing. It looks kind of like a cross between a Harrier Jumpjet and a 747. Very strange. Holds about 69 people. Flies like a kite &#8212; sways all over the bloody place.<br />
The meal was another sandwich &#8212; turkey, this time. No ice cream, though. We got a gourmet cookie instead. Whee. This time I had a rowmate, a guy from Cisco Systems. We engaged in hearty conversation in the last 20 minutes or so of the flight, recounting our views of Digital Equipment, and how we realized that they were doomed long before Compaq bought &#8217;em out.<br />
I&#8217;d forgotten how humid it gets out here (in the East, that is). Calgary is dry &#8212; it&#8217;s like walking through a lake out here (comparatively speaking, of course). I sweltered the entire way downtown to the Omni Netherlands.<br />
Nathan, who&#8217;d only recently returned to Calgary from here, complained that the Omni&#8217;s rooms were &#8220;small&#8221;. I could easily hold a small concert in my room. I hate to know what he thinks &#8220;big&#8221; is.<br />
Well, I&#8217;m off to bed now. I&#8217;ve got a long day tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. It&#8217;s going to be a long week&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We&#8217;ve been blessed with a good winter this year &#8212; it hasn&#8217;t rained much. (Of course, I would be writing this on a rainy day.) In fact, we&#8217;ve had a lot of sun, though it has been fairly chilly. Yes, I realize that chilly here is warm compared to the rest of Canada right now. What can I say &#8212; I&#8217;m a wimp.<br />
But even with all that good weather, Vancouver can get a little boring, especially if you don&#8217;t get out a lot. This was our problem &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t really gone anywhere except for the island in the past three months. So Allison and I decided it was time to visit Seattle again. A good road trip was just what we needed.<br />
We got up relatively early on Saturday (which for me, is before 9:00am) and got ready to leave. By 9:09, we were fuelled up and heading south on Burrard for our adventure of the day. We arrived at the border in short time, and breezed through, as usual. It was a good thing we weren&#8217;t coming from Seattle to Vancouver, though &#8212; the lineup looked about an hour in length.<br />
It was a good day for the drive &#8212; the sun was bright and the sky was (mostly) clear. We could see Mt. Baker quite easily. It&#8217;s a very imposing mountain, especially when you know that it&#8217;s two hours away, and the ones just across the Burrard Inlet look the same height. It&#8217;s huge &#8230; just like its sister mountain, Mt. Rainier. Both are dormant volcanos &#8230; just like Mount St. Helen&#8217;s was dormant.<br />
We found ourselves in downtown Seattle just after 12:00, just in time for lunch. We drove around attempting to find inexpensive parking (by inexpensive, we were looking for anything that charged less than US$7 an hour. Seattle is expensive.<br />
We eventually ended up at the lot Allison and her friend had once used when visiting Seattle. It has a US$5 special that lets you park for up to 10 hours. It&#8217;s not the most convenient location, but considering that there&#8217;s no lot attendant, no pavement, and nothing really nearby, it&#8217;s fairly reasonable.<br />
Actually, there is one thing nearby &#8212; an elevator. It takes you up to what used to be a causeway from &#8220;upper&#8221; Seattle to the piers on the waterfront. When the piers closed down, the causeway was mostly destroyed. Part of it remained, and the city (assumedly it was them) put in an elevator to let you down to the harbourfront. At the top, it let you out two blocks from Pike Place Market. Convenient, non?<br />
The first order of business was lunch. We had seen a mexican restaurant while searching for parking, but we were interested in a chili place at the south end of the market. It took a while to get there (about half the population of Washington State was crammed into the three blocks that make up the market area), and we were disappointed when we arrived. It seems that the owner/operator had been made an Honorary Member of the Coronary Bypass Association, and was enjoying an extended stay in the Swedish Hospital.<br />
Yeah, you&#8217;re probably thinking what we thought &#8212; he was in Sweden, the reason he wasn&#8217;t here to run the store, right? Well, it wasn&#8217;t until our little attempt to get lost in Seattle that we found the Swedish Hospital. It&#8217;s one of the hospitals in Seattle. Why &#8220;Swedish&#8221;? It was started in Seattle by a pair of Swedes back at the turn of the century. It&#8217;s now one of the largest hospitals in the state.<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
Finding there would be no chili that day, we went out in search of our mysterious Mexican restaurant. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t hard &#8212; Taco Del Mar. It was a kind of fancy Taco Bell, without all the choices. But I was in the mood for a burrito, and that seemed to be their speciality. I got the jumbo spicy beef (which was their smallest burrito &#8212; I don&#8217;t know why they called it &#8220;jumbo&#8221;). Allison got the super burrito (the same as the jumbo, except it had guacamole).<br />
Kinda bland, not nearly as tasty as the burritos we had at some rinky-dinky little taco stand in Anaheim, but filling. At least we wouldn&#8217;t starve for the rest of the day. And the service was outstandingly pleasant for a fast-food joint. A definite thumbs up, if just for the service alone.<br />
Afterwards, we opted to try something we hadn&#8217;t done before &#8212; go to the Seattle Art Museum. Allison had been craving some intellectual input lately, and I thought a visit to the museum would be a good idea. The last time we were in Seattle, they were exhibiting Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s designs. This time, it was the History of Porcelain. Okay, maybe not the most riveting of subjects, but interesting nonetheless.<br />
The Chinese first started producing the fine porcelain we all know in the 10th Century CE (AD, for those of you not familiar with the Common Era system). However, they had developed the materials and techniques around 3200 BCE &#8230; a lot earlier than most people would have thought. In fact, the only thing that kept them from making good porcelain back then was a lack of heat. Porcelain needs temperatures of about 1,300 C to become porcelain &#8230; otherwise, you just get earthenware. Not as strong, and not as nice.<br />
There were some amazing specimens. Utterly beautiful in design, completely perfect in shape and colour. The designs on them intricate and delicate. Then you read the tag, and find that the bowl, or plate, or water jug you are looking at predates Chris Columbus&#8217; little sojourn to North America by a hundred years.<br />
The exhibit was arranged so that you walked in a loop, starting with the &#8220;birth&#8221; of porcelain, and ending with its &#8220;end&#8221;. (No, we haven&#8217;t disposed of porcelain, just that porcelain is now a pottery technique, not a commodity considered more valuable than precious metals.) The exhibit tells how until the 17th and 18th centuries, most of the porcelain came from China. But after a couple of wars, the technique finally leaked to Japan and Korea, and the supply increased. It wasn&#8217;t until the 17th century that Europe began to tinker with the techniques and come up with its own porcelain.<br />
After our tour of expensive pottery, we ventured to an exhibit of native art. A lot of it was Australian, and actually fairly difficult to look at (the pictures were a bit on the psychedelic side). We didn&#8217;t stay long, and opted for the more typical parts of an art museum: Ancient Mediterranean (e.g. Roman, Greek, Egyptian), the 17th century masters, 18th century art, 19th century Americana, and 20th century moderne, including photographs and a set of prints by Liechtenstein.<br />
We returned to the market, and walked through it again in the opposite direction. (This was when we learned the fate of the chili shop&#8217;s owner.) Like Vancouver&#8217;s Granville Island, the contents of Pike Place Market change fairly regularly, which makes finding some things fairly difficult. All depends on your needs, I guess. Anyway, we wandered around a bit before ending up at a small park overlooking the harbour. There, we sat on the grass, warmed ourselves in the sun, and watched the world walk by.<br />
After a while, we hit upon the idea of touring around Seattle. While Allison had been through other portions of the city before, I had only been in the downtown core. I wanted to see the rest of it. We returned to the car, and drove our way into the heart of the city &#8230; after I missed a turn and ended up in a different area. We were attempting to find Capitol Hill on our own. There were no signs, no hints, and we had no map. It makes for an interesting adventure.<br />
We drove around in seemingly endless loops (you have to understand that we weren&#8217;t really heading in any particular direction), eventually finding ourselves next to the convention centre. We headed east from there, soon finding ourselves at the Edward Nordstrom Medical Tower. This was when we found Seattle University and the Swedish Hospital. We headed south for a little ways until we opted to turn into one of the neighbourhoods &#8212; First Hill.<br />
First Hill is so named because it was one of Seattle&#8217;s first neighbourhoods. Thus, it is also one of the oldest &#8230; and it certainly looks that way. Most of the homes are run-down and/or boarded up. The neighbourhood is mostly poor. It&#8217;s sad, really, because with a little money, most of the homes would look much better.<br />
We soon found ourselves on 23rd Ave., turning north. We still didn&#8217;t know where Capitol Hill was, and it was time for us to find out. We popped into an AM/PM and picked up two Cokes and a map of Seattle. The map had all the information we wanted. Much to our surprise, we were not only in the right area, we weren&#8217;t far away from Capitol Hill. Another kilometre or so north on 23rd, and we were there.<br />
Capitol Hill looks like the kind of neighbourhood you see in Hollywood movies &#8212; nice, large homes on moderately-sized lots in a very nice area. Basically, a rich area. We drove up and down Capitol Hill&#8217;s streets, gaping at the homes, very much wishing that we could afford one.<br />
We soon left, on our second search of the day. Now, this quest definitely shows off our geekhood &#8212; we wanted to find Microsoft. I had a minor fascination with seeing what this company was actually like. One of the world&#8217;s most powerful companies, and all I&#8217;d ever actually seen was a small picture of one of its buildings (which, it turns out, is the recruiting building).<br />
We headed north on 23rd Ave. (which turns into 24th), and looked for off-ramp for Highway 520 East. We missed it, and ended up heading directly into the University of Washington. I was reminded very soon after of the long debates on USENET about who should own the uw.* hierarchy &#8212; the University of Washington, or the University of Waterloo. Several other UW schools tried to get into the debate, but we shut them out pretty quickly.<br />
The university is quite large, and has a nice campus. The buildings are old (or at least look old), much like the Ivy League schools back east. One of them is the Mary Gates building, named after Bill Gates&#8217; late mother, who was also a schoolteacher, UW regent, and a chair of United Way International. I guess Billy gets his goodwill from his mom.<br />
Finding our way to Highway 520, we headed for Redmond. We really had no exact idea where we were going, other than Redmond. We didn&#8217;t have directions, we didn&#8217;t know where in Redmond Microsoft lay, and our map didn&#8217;t show roads any smaller than the major highways.<br />
Arriving in Redmond about 30 minutes later, we proceeded to search. Redmond has two things: Industrial parks populated almost entirely by high-tech companies, and townhouses. There are a few actual houses, but the domicile of preference seems to be the higher-density models. It fits with the youngish population, I suppose.<br />
We drove around the city, covering the north, east, and west sides before finally stopping at a gas station for assistance. The clerk gave me a strange look, and with a straight face provided me directions. She probably added &#8220;geek&#8221; or &#8220;weirdo&#8221; as I left.<br />
Microsoft probably moved to Redmond because it needed space. A lot of space. A huge amount of space. The campus (and it really is a campus) is larger than most (if not all) Canadian universities. It&#8217;s not just huge, it&#8217;s freakin&#8217; huge. There are at least 50 buildings scattered about the area, covering every portion of the company. It&#8217;s impressive.<br />
The scary part is that there is no construction going on at Microsoft. All the buildings are complete. And full. This includes a conference centre, dormitories (large ones, about 20 storeys each), research labs, and separate offices for the Internet portions of the company. It&#8217;s frightening, just plain frightening. You actually have to wonder why the FTC hasn&#8217;t broken the company up yet.<br />
After our little tour, we returned to the highway, and headed our way home. The trip back was as uneventful as the trip down, and without the sun blinding our every movement. A couple of hours later, we arrived at the Cloverdale Truck crossing, and made our way back into Canada. Then we were off to find dinner.<br />
Originally, we were heading for the Langley crossing, which would have put us near the Sammy J. Peppers in Langley (or Surrey &#8230; one of the two). But we were a fair distance from it. So instead, we went to find the Sammy J. Peppers in Coquitlam. Along with the rest of the Lower Mainland.<br />
Luckily, we got there as the crowd was beginning to die down. We indulged ourselves in a nice meal, and prepared to retire to home with a good movie &#8212; Steve Martin&#8217;s &#8220;Bowfinger&#8221;.<br />
Sunday was our lazy day. We got up late, we didn&#8217;t move fast or far. Although we did for a long walk, eventually ending up at Urban Fare to get fixin&#8217;s for dinner. A fairly relaxing day.<br />
I&#8217;m glad we took the time to do all this &#8212; this week is going to be rough. I&#8217;ve got a small mountain of work that should probably kick into full gear by mid-afternoon today. Then I get to lock myself away until Friday, when the drafts are due. All supposed to be done by Tuesday. That&#8217;s my drop-dead date.<br />
I hate deadlines.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I get by with a little help from my friends.<br />
In this case, it was Stuart and Therese, two of my oldest and closest friends. I ventured to the wilds of Calgary to say &#8220;Hi&#8221; and check out the sights. Well, at least so far as Calgary has sights&#8230;<br />
The flight left Vancouver at 6:00pm. WestJet is not the most comfortable airline in Canada, but when you&#8217;re travelling a mere hour, comfort is a minor issue. However, when arriving just after 8:00pm (Calgary time), I was realizing just how much a comfortable seat makes a difference. Luckily, Stuart was there to pick me up and whisk me away to a comfortable car.<br />
Calgary was cold. Really cold. About -20 C. Okay, so it&#8217;s like the rest of Canada right now &#8212; I live in BC. If it drops to 5 C people start to think the next Ice Age is coming. I&#8217;m beginning to be that way. I found Calgary quite cold, a little too cold as a matter of fact. My nose hairs froze almost instantly (leaving that rather awkward feeling in your nose), closely followed by my fingers and my feet.<br />
Calgary was under a fair amount of snow. Not as much as they&#8217;d had earlier in the week, but still more than Vancouver had all last year. In a strange way, it was neat to see all that whiteness after so long of green &#8230; that feeling faded soon, however. White&#8217;s kinda &#8230; bland.<br />
We arrived at Chez Therese and Stuart about a half hour after leaving the airport. I hadn&#8217;t seen Therese for over a year &#8212; six hours on New Year&#8217;s Eve 1998. That was it. It was nice to be reunited with old friends again. I was promptly fed a tasty meal of &#8230; actually, I don&#8217;t know what to call it except for hamburger casserole, but with ground turkey instead of beef. It was a good welcome.<br />
[Ed. Note: What I did not originally write in the email was that I told Stuart and Therese that I was leaving Allison and Vancouver. They were the first ones to know (I had only made my mind up on the flight to Calgary). Therese, of course, had to be melodramatic and asked Stuart to pinch her. At first, I thought she was going to try and talk me out of it. I was very relieved when I found that they were not only happy, but excited to know I was getting out. There&#8217;s more on this in the next log entry.]<br />
We talked continuously for what seemed like hours. Now that I think of it, it was hours &#8212; Therese and Stuart both had work the next day, and I had an interview with an Internet startup somewhere in Calgary the next morning. So it was off to bed.<br />
But not off to sleep. Although I suspect Stuart and Therese slept well, I had a minor problem &#8230; Tao and Te, their Siamese cats. Siamese are genetically bred not to sleep when everyone does. And their favourite thing to do when other are sleeping is playing. With ping pong balls. All night.<br />
The next morning, I showered and changed into my interview outfit. Therese and I would then hunker down for the 30 minute trip to the University via the Calgary Transit system. It was then I realized just how much I don&#8217;t like cold weather &#8212; it cut right through my business suit. My thighs froze almost instantly. It was uncomfortable, to say the least. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t long before the bus arrived.<br />
My instructions were simple: Take the bus to the C-Train. (That wasn&#8217;t too hard to do, and I had Therese with me in case I got confused.) Take the C-Train to the Sunnyside stop. Walk west from the Sunnyside to 10th St., and turn left. Walk until I get to Kensington. Turn right, and walk until 14th. Look for the old Bre-X building. Of course, it&#8217;s only known as that by infamy. The sign on it now is &#8220;One Nineteen&#8221;. (Although there is a &#8220;Bro-X Minerals&#8221; in the first floor.)<br />
I nearly froze to death getting there.<br />
The interview was an offshoot of an interview I conducted some weeks ago for an article Allison and I worked on. The idea was, in theory, to get a job with an eCommerce company. The interview was a bit odd &#8212; the three guys at the table literally pulled me apart trying to find out what I knew. It was destined not to be a good lead. (And so I found out today, it didn&#8217;t pan out at all &#8212; I was rejected.)<br />
No loss &#8212; it was, if anything, good experience for interview later on. Allison got a good lead on a job at her old company, which not only looked good, but should pay me more. I still haven&#8217;t heard anything from them, but at the very least, I&#8217;ll be better prepared when I go to see them.<br />
After the interview, I went to track down Stuart&#8217;s office. It wasn&#8217;t quite as cold when I left, so I could at least get there without losing the feeling in my extremities. Finding the building (after having to call Therese to make sure I was at the right building), I found Stuart was still knee-deep in work. I hustled out and off to humour myself for an hour or so.<br />
Calgary has built itself around its harsh weather &#8212; the malls cover almost the entire downtown, and you can get around without having to go outside (at least for any distance). Very convenient. This is particularly interesting around lunch, when all the business towers empty into the food courts. It&#8217;s quite strange to watch the flood of people &#8230; it&#8217;s almost like watching an anthill.<br />
I returned to Stuart&#8217;s office at 1:00 for lunch. We disappeared to some weird place called &#8220;Burger Inn&#8221;. They serve, well, hamburgers. And ostrichburgers. Not to mention buffalo, emu, venison &#8230; basically any kind of meat you can get in the province. Good burgers, though&#8230;<br />
Stuart then passed me off to Therese at the University so he could get back to work. Therese had work to finish, so I just hung around for a while until she was ready to go. Then it was back out into the cold to get to the C-Train again. (At this point, I was ready to flinch every time I went outdoors &#8212; that cold is just brutal. Of course, I&#8217;m probably just turning into your typical Vancouver wimp.)<br />
That evening, we were going to go out with a group of Therese&#8217;s colleagues and friends to go see &#8220;Scream 3&#8221; and then go see a band called &#8220;Plastikman&#8221;. Therese&#8217;s car, which had been having a few problems, only made it a couple of kilometres before Stuart had to pull over. Therese had been telling Stuart for roughly that distance that there was something wrong with the car.<br />
Although I don&#8217;t know exactly what happened, it looked like an electrical problem of some kind. Basically, there wasn&#8217;t enough power to keep the engine running &#8230; something that smells like a bad alternator. Either way, we weren&#8217;t going anywhere. While Stuart tried to get the car to start again, Therese and I attempted to get a hold of their friends and let them know we weren&#8217;t going to make it. We were less than successful.<br />
About an hour after all this started, the CAA truck finally showed up. Because the cab was so small, only one person could fit in with the driver. That person was Stuart. This left Therese and I to hike to the nearest warm place (a Safeway) &#8212; about half a kilometre away. Through shin-deep snow. In the freezing cold. By the time we got there, neither of us could feel our feet, and my ears (now exposed to the cold due to my recent haircut) were about ready to fall off.<br />
We were at the Safeway about 45 minutes before a cab finally showed up to whisk us away (Calgary seems to have a severe shortage of cabs in the winter). By that time Stuart had already returned from dropping the car off.<br />
We returned to Therese and Stuart&#8217;s, where we decided to order pizza and watch a movie. This meant going outside again. And into a car that had no heater. I froze. (As you can tell, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the cold anymore.)<br />
We rented &#8220;The 13th Warrior&#8221;, a movie starring Antonio Banderas, filmed in BC, and based on the Old English epic poem &#8220;Beowulf&#8221;. Despite my degree in English, which involved Old English literature, I completely missed the references. That could also be because the movie sucked.<br />
The next morning, we met Geoff (another one &#8212; it certainly makes for awkward conversations when trying to figure out which Geoff is the subject), Jeanine (this is a total guess on spelling, I probably have it wrong), and Sean for dim sum.<br />
Dim sum is one of life&#8217;s little pleasures. It&#8217;s the sort of thing I&#8217;d love to do on a regular basis &#8230; except every time we try, we always end up not doing it. I don&#8217;t know why, it just seems to end up that way.<br />
After dim sum, we traipsed through a local bakery for the dessert we didn&#8217;t get (the dessert cart mysteriously vanished during our repast), and then headed off to the Eaton&#8217;s Centre. (The Eaton&#8217;s is gone, obviously.) Apparently, it was a good day to buy clothes. Everything was on sale.<br />
Not in a buying mood, I followed our little troupe around the mall, looking for anything that might pique my curiousity. Sadly, the only thing I found was a good deal on a CD I seem to have lost a few years ago. I guess I&#8217;m just not the clothes-buying type of person. But that&#8217;s just me, I guess. I suck at fashion (I need other people to dress me), and can&#8217;t buy decent-looking clothes to save my life.<br />
On the bright side, I don&#8217;t spend a lot of money on clothes.<br />
Returning home, Stuart, Therese, and I sat down to watch &#8220;The 13th Warrior&#8221;. Therese had passed out about 15 minutes into the movie the previous night, Stuart joining her about half-way through. So we watched the movie from near its start.<br />
Then it was off to dinner and a movie. We went to Red Devil, a small chain that&#8217;s now in Calgary. It&#8217;s a barbeque joint, priding itself on hot sauces. Overall, pretty good food &#8212; really good calamari (and I&#8217;m not a fan of calamari). We were there for about two hours, laughing, drinking, and eating. It was almost like old times (except that we were missing a few others).<br />
Then it was off to our entertainment for the evening. We opted to see Leo&#8217;s newest flick, &#8220;The Beach&#8221;. Yeah, I know, what possessed us to see that? Well, strange as it may seem, it&#8217;s actually not that bad a movie. First off, this was done by Danny Boyle, who brought us such cinematic gems as &#8220;Trainspotting&#8221;, &#8220;Life Less Ordinary&#8221;, and &#8220;Shallow Grave&#8221;. Unfortunately, this movie didn&#8217;t start getting interesting until Leo&#8217;s character started losing his mind.<br />
Mind you, that was the point &#8212; it&#8217;s very similar to &#8220;Apocalypse Now&#8221;, and features many references to the movie. We were amazed at the number of people who really didn&#8217;t seem to get that point.<br />
Heathens.<br />
We started late the next day. Really late. It was Sunday, and darn it, we were sleeping in. When we finally got ourselves up and running, we went out for lunch to Arden&#8217;s. As in Jan Arden, the singer. She owns a restaurant in Calgary. It&#8217;s quite good, really, and showcases a lot of tasty fare. Best philly cheese steak sandwich I&#8217;ve had since the Copper Penny in Kingston. (Of course, there&#8217;s also Dix here in Vancouver, and it&#8217;s also really good.)<br />
After lunch, Stuart and Therese dropped me off at my relatives, where I could have a chat (albeit a brief one) with my Aunt and Uncle. Sadly, Uncle Mike was off playing basketball, so I was only able to speak with my Aunt Brenda. Our meeting was short-lived, however, as I had to get to the airport to catch my plane. Therese and Stuart reappeared not long after.<br />
The flight back was a little more pleasant than the flight out, although I&#8217;m not sure why. Probably because I was returning to Vancouver. It&#8217;s always nice to return here. It&#8217;s a lovely view from 20,000 feet up.<br />
I&#8217;m home again, and quite comfortable where I am. The sun is out, the birds are chirping, and the only snow is a few hundred feet up a mountain.<br />
I like it that way.</p>

And so the new year begins &#8212; the last of the second millennium, Ado Domini (or Common Era, if you prefer). It&#8217;s been a rough year for us, with many events having rocked our little world time and time again. Here&#8217;s the brief synopsis of the past year:<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, another Christmas has come and (almost) gone. It was an unusual Christmas for me, mostly because things have changed. My family is bigger than it was, and I&#8217;ve got a few more traditions to start remembering.<br />
The first of these traditions is waking up at 8:00am. Around here, Christmas starts a bit earlier than in Oakville. This is primarily due to Mr. Collins, who was up at 5:00am, waiting for Christmas to begin. His energy certainly makes Christmas interesting.<br />
Collins Christmases are big events &#8230; much bigger than Sowrey Christmases (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with either of them). Waking up to a Collins Christmas means wading through to some place on the couch where you can spend a comfortable hour or two unwrapping presents. It reminds me of my childhood (no doubt in part to Mr. Collins&#8217; enthusiasm).<br />
Even the practice of opening a gift on Christmas Eve continues here. It&#8217;s a practice we Sowreys gave up a few years ago (I don&#8217;t even remember when), so it was a little strange to open a gift last night. But it really prepares you for the next morning.<br />
Generousity is the word around here. In fact, &#8220;give until it hurts&#8221; comes to mind. Over the course of the past 14 hours, I have received the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 CD: Harry Connick Jr. &#8211; When My Heart Finds Christmas (from my parents)</li>
<li>1 DVD: Saving Private Randy Special Edition (from the Collins)</li>
<li>1 Penguin Shaker (I&#8217;ll get back to this in a moment)</li>
<li>2 packs: Ferrero Rocher (3 chocolates to a pack) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Terry&#8217;s Chocolate Orange (Collins)</li>
<li>1 stick: deodorant (Collins)</li>
<li>2 rolls: 100 ASA film (Collins)</li>
<li>1 CD: Will Smith &#8211; Willennium (from Jane)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Sweet Story Book (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Life Savers &#8211; Night Before Christmas (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: Tom Clancy &#8211; Net Force (from my Nana)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shampoo (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bottle: Body Shop shower gel (Collins)</li>
<li>1 bar: glycerine soap (Collins)</li>
<li>1 train whistle (sounds like a real whistle, too!) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Reach toothbrush (Collins)</li>
<li>1 Orange Crush(R) candy cane (Collins)</li>
<li>1 homemade orange bath balm/bomb (Collins)</li>
<li>1 feather duster (I think this was a hint) (Collins)</li>
<li>1 pack: Hershey Chocolate Storybook (Collins)</li>
<li>1 book: The Idiot&#8217;s Guide to Personal Finance in your 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s for Canadians (from my sister)</li>
<li>1 book: The World Encyclopedia of Beer (from Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: beige with striping (Allison)</li>
<li>1 sweater: light green (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: button-down plaid (Allison)</li>
<li>1 shirt: funky psychedelic black and white (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Motorcycle racing (from the Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 set: bar tools, including bottle opener and corkscrew (from the Vailmonts)</li>
</ul>
<p>That was just me. (Needless to say, I&#8217;m really glad we brought the car.) Oh, and before your eyes bug out from the length of the above list, I would like to direct you to one little detail: a lot of the stuff on that list is &#8220;small&#8221; stuff, such as candy and books.<br />
Then there was the &#8220;collective&#8221;: Allison and I. Together we received:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 bagel-sized toaster (Vailmonts)</li>
<li>1 pizza stone with cutter and lifter (Collins)</li>
<li>1 spaghetti pot (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: chip bag clips (Collins)</li>
<li>1 set: matching bathroom towels (Collins)</li>
<li>1 game: Sim Theme Park (Randy)</li>
<li>1 pastry blender (non-electric) (Collins)</li>
<li>3 tins: Misty Mountain Chocolate Paté (Collins)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to list Allison&#8217;s gifts &#8230; it&#8217;s already too much stuff. But like I said before: &#8220;Give until it hurts.&#8221; After this Christmas, Allison and I are going to make a donation to charity to compensate for the abundance of gifts. We are certainly thankful, and want to share thanks with others less fortunate than ourselves.<br />
Now, back to that Penguin Shaker. It seems that Santa made a visit last night that I wasn&#8217;t aware of (my Santa was very good at hiding things so I couldn&#8217;t see them packed into the car). I apparently made her, er, his &#8220;nice boy list&#8221;, and was therefore the lucky recipient of a Penguin Shaker.<br />
What&#8217;s a Penguin Shaker? Glad you asked. (Incidentally, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, this gets my CGOTY award (Cool Gift Of The Year). Back in the 30&#8217;s after prohibition was lifted, there was a big trend to martinis. The entire movement spawned a style that included penguins (tuxedos; ice). Thus was born the penguin-shaped martini shaker. The basic shape is of a martini shaker, with two wings, and a beak. The beak has a plug at the end that (when unscrewed) acts as a spout; a built-in filter prevents the ice from coming out. It&#8217;s silver-plated and utterly gorgeous.<br />
Following the unwrapping, we proceeded to breakfast, courtesy of Master Chef Randy. Then it was helping Mrs. Collins prepare the evening&#8217;s feast of roast beast. (Okay, turkey, but the Dr. Seuss in me was yelling to get out.) I spent a large portion of the afternoon chopping.<br />
When the rest of the family arrived this evening, we exchanged a few more gifts, and then proceeded to dinner. Not much different than a Sowrey Christmas dinner, except that it&#8217;s a lot quieter here. (Those of us who remember the Sowrey/Sinnott dinners will remember the struggle to gain control of the table&#8217;s conversation.)<br />
After dinner, we all broke up into various conversations. Allison adjourned downstairs for a while to use Randy&#8217;s PlayStation, where Allison totally wiped the walls with me. Allison is the video game equivalent of a pool shark &#8212; she starts off making you feel good, and then cleans your clock. I lost a few layers of skin (not to mention several notches on Ye Olde Ego Meter) when she trounced me 12-0 on Triple Play 98.<br />
I hate sports games.<br />
Okay, so I&#8217;m a poor loser. I get frustrated easily. I like being able to do *something* other than *nothing*. That&#8217;s when I get labelled &#8220;sore loser&#8221;. Things I need to work on for my New Year&#8217;s Resolution, I guess.<br />
Anyway, that&#8217;s a Collins Christmas for you. &#8216;Tis time for me to consider getting ready for tomorrow &#8230; who know&#8217;s what it will bring?<br />
Merry Ho-Ho!</p>

		<p>The alarm went off at 8:00, and I staggered out of bed. Chris and I had made tentative plans to go for breakfast, but I needed to call him and find out. Chris couldn&#8217;t make it. The whole week had been like that &#8212; we&#8217;d been trying to get together, but one thing after another prevented our reunion.<br />
I returned to bed.<br />
I ran a few errands that morning, leaving Allison in Oakville. The errands took longer than I originally planned, putting me back on time. But I made sure to stop into Canadian Computer on Speers. I wanted to see Chris, even if for only five minutes.<br />
Two years ago, Chris was a computer novice. He hated the things. (Especially the 286 he used for most of his work.) Now he frightens me. I&#8217;m amazed at all the things he&#8217;s learned in the PAST YEAR. Now he&#8217;s an expert. And that meant he was busy.<br />
I got to talk with Chris for all of about 10 minutes. The rest of the time, he was help customers and answering phones. (One of the customers was a teacher from my high school, Suzi Beber, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen since I graduated.)<br />
Then it was over. Realising I had to go home, I bade Chris farewell, and headed home. All the way, I felt fairly numb. I had a huge list of people I&#8217;d wanted to visit with. Most of them didn&#8217;t even get a phone call. (Some people think I have too many friends.) It was too late, though. I couldn&#8217;t do anything more. I saw a few people, chatted with a few more. But it was over too soon. Too fast.<br />
We arrived at the airport about an hour ahead of time. I prefer half an hour for domestic flights, but Allison pointed out that we usually get rushed. I said goodbye to my dad, hugged my sister (my mom didn&#8217;t want to come &#8212; she hates goodbyes &#8212; so I hugged her before we left Oakville), and headed into Terminal 3.<br />
We arrived in Vancouver around 7:30pm PDT following a rather eventless flight. (Not that I&#8217;m looking for an eventful flight.) We grabbed our bags, hopped the Park N&#8217; Fly shuttle, and went to pick up the car.<br />
The car&#8217;s battery was dead. I don&#8217;t know how the heck they got the car there, short of pushing it. You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have noted that.<br />
Morons.<br />
As we drove home (after getting the car jumped), I remarked on something I hadn&#8217;t noticed before. I felt like I was home. For the first time since I moved here, I felt like I was at home. It was a strange feeling. For the longest time, I didn&#8217;t think I could ever feel at home here. But I do, to some degree at least.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I still miss my family and friends. I always will &#8212; you&#8217;re all a huge part of my life. I can&#8217;t forget you any more than I can sever an arm and not notice.<br />
But I was home. I collapsed in our couch, and felt like I was at home. A strange feeling, indeed.</p>

		<p>The Old Man was still cursing the sink the following morning. By the time Allison and I left for Waterloo, the plumber had arrived to solve the problem once and for all. (It would take an additional two hours, and several holes drilled in the wall to finally eradicate the clog.)<br />
The drive up to Waterloo was very pleasant &#8212; it was a beautiful day. I wanted to show Allison where I went to school. The memories were flooding back even before I turned onto Highway 86. By the time I turned onto Ring Road, I was getting some serious deja vu.<br />
But the campus seemed foreign. The students looked much younger (did I ever look that young?), more naive. The university seemed no different than I remembered, with the exception of modifications to South Campus Hall.<br />
After a quick driving tour of the campus, we started the walking tour. This took us from South Campus Hall, between the science buildings, through Math and Computer (I was disappointed to see the Red Room is no longer visible), through Davis Center, back to the Campus Centre (aka the Student Life Centre), over to Needless Hell (aka Needles Hall), through Hagey Hall, and then back to South Campus Hall.<br />
It felt strange walking around. I felt old. Allison commented that an entire (three-year) class had entered and graduated since I left. It&#8217;s a strange feeling, walking around, not seeing any familiar faces.<br />
We left U(W), and drove around Uptown Waterloo, then Downtown Kitchener. We stopped for a while to take advantage of the Oktoberfest that was underway, picking up a pair of rather flavourless sausages.<br />
It&#8217;s kind of ironic that in the five years I was in Waterloo (four years of which I was actually there for Oktoberfest), I only went ONCE to the festivities. (This was prior to my decision to start drinking alcohol, so needless to say I didn&#8217;t have that much fun.) Okay, that&#8217;s not the ironic part. Here&#8217;s the irony: As we headed back to the car, we were approached by a pair of (American?) tourists who were looking for more &#8220;fun&#8221; attractions. They asked this of a guy, who although spent four years in Waterloo during Oktoberfest, had not lived there for over three years. I directed them to the Hans Haas (aka the Information booth).<br />
We headed up to Highway 7 on our trip out to Guelph. Within minutes, we were leaving Kitchener/Waterloo heading east. I had to admit, I almost didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; there are many memories for me there, and several people I would have liked to visit with. But there wasn&#8217;t time. There&#8217;s never enough time.<br />
We drove around Guelph, during which I attempted to give Allison a rough tour of the area. I don&#8217;t know Guelph as well as my friends who went to Guelph (or spent a lot of time in the city), but I&#8217;d been there enough times that I knew the area.<br />
Our first stop was at McCrae House. Well, after we drove around a bit before we found it (we took a wrong turn and ended up on the wrong side of the Speed River). McCrae House is the birthplace of John McCrae, author of &#8220;In Flanders Fields&#8221;. We appeared 45 minutes late to go in the museum, unfortunately.<br />
The tour continued up the sidestreets around McCrae House, where Allison oohed and aahed at the beauty of the leaf-covered streets and all the red brick houses. If it weren&#8217;t for the distance, the winters, and the dryness, I figure I could get Allison to move there.<br />
Then it was past the &#8216;X&#8217; House (the &#8216;X&#8217;s are still visible in the window, by the way) on Gordon St. before turning into the University of Guelph. The tour here was fair short, as our time was continuing be tight. We had to be in Acton by 6:30, and I wasn&#8217;t sure how long that would take.<br />
Again, memories. Pangs of regret. The invisible tears of missed friends. They say that smell is the strongest sense that can evoke a memory &#8212; I often find that sight works just as well.<br />
Returning to Highway 7, we continued on our way east. We stopped briefly on the edge of Guelph to get something to drink. I hopped into the convenience store, and purchased a ginger ale for Allison, and a Sprite for me. Well, it was going to be a Sprite until I spied my favourite drink &#8230; Wink. You can&#8217;t get Wink in BC (mind you, you can&#8217;t get Cheezies in Ontario). I took the bottles and presented them to the clerk. I was $0.20 short. I was about to pull the Wink back, resigning myself to never having a visit with an old friend. The clerk, however, said I could pay him back later.<br />
Oh. Okay. Sure. No problem.<br />
Sucker.<br />
We arrived in Acton shortly after 6:00, far too early to arrive at our destination. We were going to Jason and Steph&#8217;s place in north Acton (aka the middle of nowhere) to have dinner with our hosts and two more of my friends, Brian and Gill. Allison had met Brian and Gill before, but I couldn&#8217;t remember if she had met Jason or Steph before. My guess was &#8220;no&#8221;.<br />
Because we were early, I thought we&#8217;d check out downtown Acton. After laughing hysterically about the phrase &#8220;It&#8217;s worth the drive to Acton&#8221;, we decided to visit the company that inspired that phrase &#8212; the Olde Hyde House.<br />
Holy leather, Batman!<br />
I&#8217;ve been in a lot of stores, but I&#8217;ve never seen that much leather before. Ever. We wandered about the store, just to see what they had. Most of it was nice, and I debated off and on about picking out Allison&#8217;s birthday present (she&#8217;s always wanted a leather jacket). Nothing really struck me as &#8220;I gotta get her that!&#8221;. (Sorry, honey, no jacket this year.)<br />
We followed the directions Brian gave me and actually managed to find Chateau Fournier. It wasn&#8217;t long before (most of) the gang was assembled. Jason and Steph treated us to a steak dinner (Jason&#8217;s mom sacrificed her fingers for our meal, accidentally slicing off part of her index finger and thumb on a vicious man(woman)-eating slicer).<br />
Then it was a game of croquano (crocano, krokano &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how the heck you spell it), a game that you could almost call circular curling. If you play it with Brian, it&#8217;s &#8220;kill your opponent&#8221;. Mind you, I&#8217;m not much different&#8230;<br />
It was hard leaving. The memory thing, y&#8217;know. The last time I&#8217;d seen Jason was at his stag; for Steph, it was camping a couple of years ago. I didn&#8217;t know when I would see either Brian or Gill again. It&#8217;s a little sobering when you realise that you have to leave your friends again. You&#8217;d think that after a while, it would stop hurting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The original plan that day was to go into Toronto. Allison was feeling better, and she wanted to see the various neighbourhoods of Toronto she had heard so much about. That was the original plan, and plans around the Sowrey homestead tend to change without warning.<br />
That morning, it was because of simple request: &#8220;Geoff, can you help me move the chest downstairs?&#8221;<br />
The dishwasher had overflowed and leaked into the basement, leaking onto a chest. Why had the dishwasher overflowed? A plug in the line. Take three guesses what we didn&#8217;t do that day.<br />
We tried Drano. To no avail. We tried a plunger. To no avail. We tried more Drano. To no avail. We tried draining the trap, running a short line to clean out whatever the problem was, filling it up with Drano, and then plunging it. To no avail.<br />
My dad returned with a bottle of sulphuric acid. The reaction between the sulphuric acid and the Drano was pungent, chasing everyone from the kitchen. It did nothing. After my father disappeared to go to his job, I went up to the load hardware store and returned with a drain snake. Even shoving 15 feet of this into the drain did nothing.<br />
Allison suffered the entire time. She wanted to go to Toronto. Instead, she was effectively banished to the basement, and surfed the Internet. All day. For about four hours, I did nothing but try and clear this wretched clog. To no avail.<br />
Dinner that evening was at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s, where I (under the supervision of the master chef Allison) made Indian curry. Mmmmm, tasty. We spent several hours there, making dinner, eating dinner, and talking the entire time. It was kind of weird, when I thought about all the things that had changed since I left for BC two years ago. Cathy had not only left home, but now had a home of her own. Her own kitchen, her own living room, her own yard.<br />
Returning home, we found my father had effectively dissected the kitchen drain. A collective 12 litres of Drano and sulphuric acid had done nothing to the clog &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere. Of course, that didn&#8217;t mean that my dad wasn&#8217;t finished. Craig&#8217;s snake went in to try and flush out the problem.<br />
I guess you really had to be there. My old man, sitting on a short stool, hanging onto a short metal rod attached to the snake. He reeled it in, he forced it back. It was like watching a dramatisation of &#8220;Old Man and the Sea&#8221;, although I&#8217;d reword it &#8212; &#8220;Old Man and the Sink&#8221;.<br />
No amount of blowing, sucking, forcing, snaking, or flushing could do anything. At 1:30am, more than 12 hours after this fiasco started, I went to bed.</p>

		<p>Allison was not feeling well the following morning. Jet lag, the flu, a bad bit of food, we didn&#8217;t know &#8212; only Allison was not feeling well. Wednesday thus became a slow day &#8212; Allison slept off her illness, I read everything I could find. And there wasn&#8217;t much.<br />
That evening, we had a family dinner (including Cathy and Craig) &#8212; roast beef. This is my dad&#8217;s favourite meal. He looks for excuses to make it. It was a good meal, and we had a good time.<br />
After dinner, I poked my head into the attic in search of a leak that had formed above the pot light over the kitchen sink. Craig was in there moments after me, and was the one willing to dive into the fibreglass insulation to find the problem. It seemed that my dad&#8217;s brand-new roof was leaking. He was not pleased.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The alarm went off at 6:45am. I was up almost immediately, Allison begged for &#8220;five more minutes&#8221;. I took the opportunity to quickly have some orange juice. Allison was in the shower moments later.<br />
We had to be at Yonge and Sheppard by 10:00am, and the trip would take about an hour. Allison wanted to get there in plenty of time, which meant we were catching the 8:03 GO Train from Clarkson.<br />
My dad delivered us to Clarkson station at 8:00. I jogged ahead of Allison and purchased tickets. After riding the GO Train for a year, I had a kind of sixth-sense that told me we had to hurry &#8212; and the time wasn&#8217;t my only tip-off. No sooner than we had our tickets in hand and were walking up the stairs to the platform did the train arrive. Like clockwork.<br />
The train went express at Clarkson, which meant we were downtown in about 20 minutes &#8212; a feat that is virtually impossible in a car at that time of day. (Of course, now that I&#8217;ve said that, one of you will probably try to prove me wrong.) Arriving at Union Station, we followed the other lemmings into the GO Concourse and into the subway.<br />
The furthest north on the Yonge line I had been was York Mills, where I got off during my tenure at Digital Equipment. That was nearly six years ago. (Six years? Oh boy, I can feel them gray hairs just popping out of my head &#8230; and the other hairs falling off.) We were heading to Sheppard, two more stops beyond that. Allison had no idea just how far north we were going.<br />
We were starving by the time we arrived. Luckily, there was a friendly neighbourhood McDonald&#8217;s on the McCorner. We indulged ourselves with a bit of McBreakfast (which is known to bring on period bouts of McNausea). The McPlace was not even half-full of people, but still took a while to get our McMeal. At first, I thought my McServer&#8217;s name was &#8220;Ebola&#8221; &#8212; imagine getting stuck with that name! As it turned out, her name was &#8220;Errola&#8221;. Dunno if that&#8217;s any better&#8230;<br />
About 9:30, we headed to the building where Allison was to have her meeting. During her departure, I was going to make a few phone calls to obtain information and make a general nuisance of myself.<br />
Allison was up there for two hours. It took me only 45 minutes to complete my tasks. (I also ran out of quarters for the payphone.) During that time, I got a tonne of information about setting up a webserver over an ASDL line, made arrangements for lunch and dinner, made an appointment for Allison at Arkipelago (my old Toronto haunt), and dropped a line to a few friends &#8230; none of whom were at their desks.<br />
That left me with a hour and 15 minutes to be bored out of my mind. I watched elevator load after elevator load walk by, none of them being Allison. After a while, I felt like a dog that watches all the cars go down the road, hoping one of them is its master. (No allusion drawing, please.)<br />
Following her seemingly-successful meeting, we headed downtown to meet with my cousin, Lauren. We went to one of her favourite restaurants, a tiny Thai bistro about a block south from Bloor. We had to wait a few minutes, but the wait was worth it &#8212; the food was good, and not too expensive (for a business-style Toronto eatery, that is).<br />
After lunch, we hopped the subway back down to Queen Street to walk to Arkipelago. It was strange walking down streets I hadn&#8217;t been on in two years. Things were at the same time familiar, but not. It was like someone had taken a picture of my old world, changed a few things, and then shown me the picture without telling me what they had changed.<br />
The familiar smell of Arkipelago was weaker than I remembered &#8230; but it had been two years since I last smelled the aroma of the wood and varnish that permeated the air. The space seemed a bit more cramped, especially with the additional people. When I had left Arkipelago, there were about 15 people. Over 30 people occupy its spaces. The people scattered everyone reminded me of what Arkipelago looked like when I started there.<br />
The meeting was with Diedre, one of Arkipelago&#8217;s newer acquisitions. We had hoped to meet with Tim or Todd, but they were both in Europe. Be that as it may, the meeting went very well, or at least so we thought. Following the discussion (which I was mostly a silent witness), I quickly visited with the Arkipelago veterans who were still there.<br />
We walked down to St. Lawrence Market, so I could show Allison Toronto&#8217;s idea of the Granville Island Market. Then it was off to meet Brenda and Marek at the Movenpick in BCE Place. We enjoyed an interesting dinner and a good discussion. Then we had to split ways and go home.</p>

		<p>If Sunday was quiet, Monday was dead. Being Thanksgiving Monday, it also meant that every store in Ontario was closed. (Stupid Holiday Shopping Act.) As it stood, Allison had work to do. Unlike myself, who was trying his best to distance himself from work, Allison had brought work with her. In an attempt to extend her client base, we were going to visit two companies in search of more work.<br />
One of them wanted a proposal that Allison would present during their meeting. Allison also wanted (well, not really, but she had no choice) to work on a series of factsheets for another company. I set her up on my mother&#8217;s computer downstairs, and let her run free.<br />
I spent part of the day calling friends, seeing who was available and who wasn&#8217;t. Some people I couldn&#8217;t get a hold of &#8212; bad phone numbers, no answer, no answering machine (it&#8217;s nearly the third millennium, people &#8212; get with it!).<br />
We met up with Kathryn that evening. It was so good to see her again &#8212; her insanely busy schedule often keeps her correspondence to a minimum &#8230; as did the long distance phone call she had to make to get her email. (I honestly can&#8217;t remember the last time I sent a snail-mail letter.)<br />
The three of us drove around Oakville in search of a place to have a light bite and a long conversation. After a bit of frustration, we ended up in Jack Astor&#8217;s, ordering bruchetta. The long conversation ensued.<br />
It was good to talk with Kathryn again. She&#8217;s one of my closest friends, even though I&#8217;m lucky if I get to see her once a year. It was pure luck that were in the same vicinity at the same time, so I was more than happy to take advantage of it.<br />
About two or so hours later, we called it an evening, and headed home. We wanted to get to bed a little earlier than usual &#8212; we had a train to catch the following morning.</p>

		<p>The fire was still going the next morning. I don&#8217;t know if they rekindled it, or if the fire had just simply burned all night.<br />
Breakfast was eggs, bacon, leftover ham, and potatoes (not the deep-fried ones, thank Heaven). It was just as tasty as ever. Following our repast, Allison and I hit the road to go home.<br />
We retraced most of our route, including a stop at Weber&#8217;s for a quick hamburger. As we entered Barrie, we spied a familiar-looking RV travelling south. Pulling in behind, we followed my parents until my dad signalled to get off the highway at Highway 89.<br />
Here, we were given directions on how to get to my Aunt&#8217;s. We planned to (briefly) stop by Aunt Ruth&#8217;s place in Caledon East. I hadn&#8217;t been there since April 1996, and was very curious to see how the landscaping renovations had gone. I was also wanted to see my relatives.<br />
My parents weren&#8217;t coming &#8212; they had to return to Oakville. Instead, Allison and I took off across remote Ontario in search of the Lockton Spinney (the name of Aunt Ruth&#8217;s home). They weren&#8217;t there. The home was deserted, only a small fluffy cat (Iggy, so I&#8217;m told) was there to greet us.<br />
I was surprised that I could find my way out of the area with little difficulty. My dad had attempted to give me fairly complicated instructions that involved a lot of turns. I opted for three: turning onto Gore Road, turning onto Old Church Road, and turning onto Airport Road. That got us to the 407, and eventually home.<br />
The rest of Sunday was fairly relaxful. We ate dinner with my parents, and later went out to take in a movie (Mystery, Alaska). After the movie, I took Allison on a short tour of Oakville neighbourhoods. Although I often compare Oakville to Nanaimo, I know there are a lot of significant differences. Most notably, the &#8220;scummy&#8221; part.<br />
In Nanaimo, the not-so-nice parts of town are not-so-nice. In Oakville, it&#8217;s Kerr Street. For those of you who don&#8217;t know Oakville, let me provide a simple example as to what Kerr Street is like. Let&#8217;s say your normal scummy part of town is like a beat-up 1974 Ford Pinto. Let&#8217;s say your typical part of Oakville is like a Rolls-Royce. Kerr Street is like a somewhat muddy Chrysler Neon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to the smell of bacon. It must be an instinctual thing &#8212; no human can sleep through the smell of bacon. Your body takes in the smell and promptly yells: &#8220;Get up ya lazy oaf! There&#8217;s bacon to be had! GET UP!&#8221;<br />
Breakfast was huge. Omelettes, bacon, and potatoes. There was also champagne and orange juice (mixed in the stronger-than-usual 1:1 ratio) to wash it all down. When all was said and eaten, we were stuffed beyond belief.<br />
The item of the day was Algonquin Park. Huntsville is a short drive from the massive greenspace, and Allison and I wanted to see it. I&#8217;d never been to Algonquin before (Allison was shocked that I&#8217;d not gone before with friends or family, though that wasn&#8217;t due to lack of interest), and was curious to see what it was like. Allison was itching to see the fall colours (which really don&#8217;t exist here in BC).<br />
The day was warm, so we dressed comfortably. We passed by Huntsville and in just over a half-hour, were entering the south-western entrance to the park. Algonquin Park is huge &#8212; 7,725 square kilometres. Not nearly as large as Wood Buffalo National Park (weighing in at a hefty 44,807 square kilometres), but larger than Prince Albert National Park (3,875 sq. km) and Banff (Bamf!) National Park (6,641 sq. km). We had missed the best time to go through the park (the colour peaked probably a week or two earlier), but it was still magnificent.<br />
After purchasing a day pass from the main gate, we headed for our first stop: Hardwood Trail. This was the shortest one in the park, and was described as &#8220;moderate&#8221;. We took this to mean &#8220;relatively not too bad&#8221;. At only 0.7 kilometres, it didn&#8217;t sound too bad.<br />
In BC, they make trails easy to follow, and will quite frequently build raised platforms and walkways to prevent the trampling and compacting of the ground. In Ontario, they tack little blue circles to trees along the way.<br />
By the time we reached the top of a hill (which gave us a spectacular view over Smoke Lake), we were tired. A lot of it had been crawling up and down hills, carefully walking so you didn&#8217;t plant your foot in a mud pit, and keeping an eye out for rogue tree roots. We passed on any more trails for the day.<br />
We headed further into the park, stopping at the Algonquin Museum about halfway through the park. This gave us an opportunity to view some of the Group of Seven paintings the museum had.<br />
Not far past the museum (still heading east), we realised that we had gone a bit too far, and turned around to head back. Along the way, we stopped at Canoe Lake, site of Tom Thompson&#8217;s tragic death in 1917. The only indication of the lake&#8217;s notoriety was a bronze and blue sign erected near the gift shop and restaurant. I think Allison and I were the only ones who read it.<br />
Following our visit to Canoe Lake, we went into Huntsville, in search of something light to eat. We weren&#8217;t interested in anything heavy &#8212; we were still reeling from the previous night&#8217;s dinner (oh, if we only knew what we were in for). But Ontario is not exactly known for light fare, and certainly not more northern Ontario.<br />
Downtown Huntsville is quite picturesque. It&#8217;s hard to tell if what we saw was genuine, or a carefully constructed charade for the tourists. We drove up the main strip, turned around and headed back (passing my mom and sister in the process) and headed back toward the cottage. We stopped at the Harvey&#8217;s along the way to indulge in a salad.<br />
There were people all over the place when we arrived back at the cottage. As of the previous day, there were 10 people: Cathy, Craig, Dave, Steve, Kathy, Madison (the baby), my parents, Allison, and myself. We now had at least four more (in all honesty, I lost count). So much for a small, cozy Thanksgiving dinner.<br />
Dave had gone overboard with dinner. The turkey was stuffed with apple/raisin/sauage stuffing, there was a ham coated in pineapple/brown sugar glaze (it apparently did a number of the pan), beans that were seemingly cooked in butter (as opposed to water), carrots (the tamest of the items), and mashed potatoes.<br />
No comments about the potatoes, you say? That&#8217;s because it takes a bit to explain them. Take your ordinary potato. Cook a few and mash them with cream and butter. Lots of it. The potatoes should be ultra-creamy. Mix in bacon bits. Real ones. Refrigerate over night. The next morning, scoop out potatoes with an ice cream scoop. Roll the potatoes in flour, then in beaten eggs, then in breading. Deep-fry until the breading is golden brown. Heat in the oven.<br />
I almost wished I hadn&#8217;t learned how those were made. There were sooooo good, but I can never eat them again.<br />
After dinner, we sat around and talked. Craig and Steve set a fire in the back yard. This doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing, until you realise what they were burning: Three mattresses, at least one box spring, several table legs (and possibly the tables), and about 1,000 square feet of carpet.<br />
And this was a small fire. Their other fires have been massive blazes that have actually frightened them. (You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d learn&#8230;) Although I don&#8217;t have hard figures, these are some of the other things these people have burned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two vacuum cleaners</li>
<li>One fibreglass jacuzzi tub</li>
<li>Countless square feet of carpet</li>
<li>Countless board-feet of lumber of all kinds</li>
<li>Leaves. Lots of &#8217;em.</li>
<li>Mattresses. Who knows how many.</li>
<li>27 couches. Yes, 27.</li>
</ul>
<p>The neighbours don&#8217;t like the cottage group too much.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We awoke to three deafening pounds on the bedroom door. Cathy had arrived at the Sowrey homestead, and wasn&#8217;t going to wait for her poor brother (and future sister-in-law) to adjust to the time change. She wanted to start up to the cottage, and she wasn&#8217;t keen on waiting.<br />
The cottage? Cathy&#8217;s significant other (more than a boyfriend, but not quite a husband) owns a cottage just outside of Huntsville. (Huntsville, for those of you without a map, is about 250 kms north of Toronto.) Huntsville&#8217;s claim to fame, aside from being a nice little town, is bringing Shania Twain to the world. She got her start at the Deerhurst Resort, which sits on the eastern edge of town.<br />
Allison and I weren&#8217;t off and running with the bulls that morning, it took us a while to get going. There was a reason for this, of course &#8212; we needed to make a phone call. What&#8217;s so special about that? Well, for one thing, it was to British Columbia, three hours behind Ontario. For another, it would settle our problem with finding a new apartment.<br />
Finally sick to death of the apartment we&#8217;re currently in (lots of noise, endless renovation, and I&#8217;m getting tired of the commute), we started looking for a new place to live. Because of the way our lease is structured, we had to hand in our notice to vacate one month and one day before our last day &#8212; September 30. This was long before we had a place settled.<br />
We had searched high and low through Kitsilano and the West End to find a place. We found a few promising ones, but nothing definite. We were getting a bit uptight about finding an apartment in time before we left for Ontario. Then, on the Tuesday before, we went to see a place in the West End. It sounded promising: Two bedrooms, balcony, view, and a dishwasher. The dishwasher was a big thing for us &#8212; we&#8217;re sick of having our counter space sucked up with a dish rack.<br />
When we arrived, there were several people directly on our heels. It was only because I thought we should get there early that we got there first. Allison whispered in my ear &#8220;we&#8217;ll take it&#8221; after only barely stepping into the apartment. But we had to wait for the manager to show the apartment to two more groups.<br />
The next group bribed her $100 to give the place to them over us. The second group offered $250 more per month. (There were two more groups from Toronto who both offered $350 more than the advertised rent.) I began to understand why prices out here were so out of whack. (In retrospect, Toronto has caught up in the Rent Race as of late.)<br />
We were told that we would find out Thursday morning if we got the apartment. When Thursday morning came, Allison (who accepted the call) discovered that the owner of the apartment (apparently it&#8217;s a condo) was concerned that Allison is self-employed. We&#8217;d expected to run into this problem &#8230; when we bought a house, not renting an apartment. Allison hastily faxed nearly every quasi-financial document that proved she was trustworthy.<br />
The call Friday morning would tell us either A) we got it, or B) we&#8217;d be apartment hunting as soon as we got back. We were hoping it wasn&#8217;t B).<br />
I dialled the management, and asked for Dana, the woman we had been dealing with. (Interesting fact: Almost every single building manager I&#8217;ve dealt with since I got here has been a woman &#8212; only one man.) Her response was: &#8220;Are you ready to sign the contract that says you&#8217;ll take me for two weeks of the year?&#8221;<br />
This is Dana&#8217;s little joke &#8212; she thinks the view at our new apartment is great, and joked that she would like to stay there two weeks of the year when she&#8217;s retired. It&#8217;s harmless &#8230; I hope.<br />
So that brings me to a new point: Our new address information. You might want to jot this down&#8230;<br />
[Information not available on the web. Sorry&#8230;]<br />
Anyway, back to the story&#8230;<br />
The whole famn damily (as my dad would say) was going to up to the cottage. Allison and I would pick up my sister, and my parents would drive up in the RoadTrek. We&#8217;d meet either in Huntsville, or at Weber&#8217;s (if we got there at the same time).<br />
Following the simple directions, Allison and I arrived at my sister&#8217;s house. Yes, house. She owns a house with Craig (hence the more-than-boyfriend, not-quite-husband designation). It&#8217;s a nice place, it just needs a little bit of work to make it their own &#8212; they&#8217;ve only been there a couple of months.<br />
And off we went. I drove for the first bit, about 80% of the trip. This took us north of Toronto, through Barrie and Orillia, and finally to Weber&#8217;s, home of the best burgers in Ontario (and possibly the world). As we blitzed north, we passed my parents, who then engaged in a game of &#8220;keep up with the children&#8221;. We met for lunch.<br />
Weber&#8217;s is a landmark in the Muskokas. Everyone travelling north of Orillia on Highway 11 knows about Weber&#8217;s. You can&#8217;t miss it. It&#8217;s the only hamburger joint with it&#8217;s own bridge across the highway (the bridge is the only privately-owned bridge (or walkway) across a highway in Canada &#8212; bought from the CN Tower in the early 80&#8217;s). They serve up to over 110,000 people in one month (up to over 6,000 in one day).<br />
Yes, they&#8217;re *that* good. That&#8217;s why the bridge is there &#8212; to get the southbound traffic.<br />
We arrived at the cottage around 3pm in the afternoon, and were promptly presented with with draught beers. They have a beer fridge, complete with taps in the front. The beer fridge did not last long, however, it was moved downstairs to make room for the pool table.<br />
In turn, the power drill came out. Two holes were bored &#8212; one in the floor, the other in a post that supported the loft. They ran a clear plastic hose from the beer fridge in the basement, up through the floor, and into a beer tap that now occupied the hole in the support post. Beer now flowed from the basement to the kitchen.<br />
(Ever seen those beer commercials where a bunch of 20-somethings romp around in this mythical cottage lifestyle? I think we found the model cottage for those commercials.)<br />
The cottage is two floors, with a loft. The main floor is the kitchen/living and dining area. There are no walls. Except for the ones around the bathroom (kind of a necessity). Downstairs are most of the beds, with walls separating most of the areas, and one room that holds Steve, Kathy, and their baby. The loft is accessed from the living area up a fairly steep ladder. There are numerous mattresses up there, capable of sleeping a large number of people.<br />
Dinner that evening was a roast &#8212; nothing horribly fancy, other than it was a roast. (This was a cottage &#8212; I was expecting hot dogs and hamburgers, maybe a steak.) It came with roasted potatoes and fresh vegetables. All courtesy of &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave.<br />
(There are two, actually three, Daves at this cottage. &#8220;Scarborough&#8221; Dave comes from, you guessed it, Scarborough. This is not to confuse him with &#8220;Huntsville&#8221; Dave, who lives just down the road. The third Dave is my dad. He doesn&#8217;t need a prefix for his name though, he&#8217;s just &#8220;Dave&#8221;.)<br />
Anyway, Scarborough Dave is a cook &#8212; used to own a restaurant. He loves cooking, or so it seems. (Cathy told us that they eat far too well at the cottage.) The meal was quite tasty, but nothing compared to what awaited us the following night.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Allison was supposed to call me when she got downtown. I was a bit concerned that it was 2:00pm, and I hadn&#8217;t heard from her. I was supposed to pick her up at 2:00 at the Stadium Skytrain station. We still had to go over to Kitsilano, pick up a wad of business cards, drive to the airport, park the car, check the bags, eat, and get on the plane. By 4:00pm. Time was running short.<br />
I was half-way to the car when my cell phone rang. I was happy I&#8217;d ducked out when I did. A few minutes later, we were on our way to Kits. One of Allison&#8217;s friends (a graphic designer) had made new cards for Allison, but had left them at her friend&#8217;s place (Allison&#8217;s friend had already left on vacation). We stopped only long enough to pick them up and head towards Granville Street.<br />
The trip down was uneventful. We dropped the car off at the Park N&#8217; Fly, hopped a shuttle, and arrived at the terminal just after 3:00pm. So far, everything was going like clockwork. Figures we&#8217;d be the ones to find the broken gear.<br />
Something told us that we were in for trouble when we stepped up to the counter. I said &#8220;virtual ticket&#8221;, and the clerk&#8217;s eyes glazed over. Even after we&#8217;d produced our identification, it took nearly 20 minutes to check us in. Colour me unimpressed. Allison was convinced this twit didn&#8217;t know how to use a computer. Everything was punched in with two fingers, and it took no less than five minutes to print the lousy boarding pass!<br />
Finally, the luggage accepted, we made a bee-line for Harvey&#8217;s, and some much-needed food. All would have gone well, except for the guy in front of me who ordered nearly everything on the menu. Luckily, Allison was a while getting her magazine, so I finished about the same time she got back.<br />
We weren&#8217;t late arriving at the gate, but the general boarding call was long since called. I felt sorry for the poor woman sitting on the aisle of our row. I think I hit her twice with my bag, and stepped on her toe. I don&#8217;t like having to take two bags on a plane &#8212; too inconvenient.<br />
The flight was pleasant: faster than usual, quite smooth, a good in-flight movie (&#8220;Swing&#8221;), and decent meals. Well, almost decent. Although Canadian Airlines now has much more flavourful meals, they&#8217;ve skimped on a few things. Take dessert for example: It was a Halloween-sized Toblerone bar. What happened to the apple crisp, eh? Or the (somewhat disgusting) cheesecakes?<br />
And the butter. Hello, what&#8217;s wrong with butter? No, they had to give us Becel. Not even decent margarine, but Becel. Blech! It&#8217;s bad enough that I can&#8217;t eat salted peanuts on the flight anymore, but I can&#8217;t have butter now. What is this world coming to?<br />
We arrived in Toronto at 11:00pm EDT, about 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The idea was to grab the bags, grab a taxi, and head home. My dad, however, beat us to it, nearly scaring Allison half to death as we waited for our luggage.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Several weeks ago, we received an invitation to a gala event in the Okanagan for one of Allison&#8217;s friends, Heather. She was getting married to her significant other, Brian. We were asked to attend the three-day event in Naramata. (Naramata is, for lack of any better description, suburban Penticton. Penticton, just in case you&#8217;re looking on a map, is at the south end of Okanagan Lake, about 30-40 minutes from Kelowna.)<br />
Allison was considered part of Heather&#8217;s inner circle of friends &#8212; she attended the shower and the stag parties. Now the question you are undoubtedly asking is: How does Allison know Heather? (Okay, maybe you&#8217;re not, but it&#8217;s still interesting.) A couple of years ago, Allison was enrolled in the Young Entrepreneurs Program, of which Heather was the instructor. Yes, Allison was Heather&#8217;s student. One of Heather&#8217;s other friends described Allison as Heather&#8217;s &#8220;most favouritest student&#8221;. (In actuality, Allison often helped in the class, as she was frequently bored with the lack of stimulating or challenging material.)<br />
So from student to peer, Allison was called upon to travel to the Okanagan and witness matrimonial bliss. With a &#8220;guest&#8221;, of course. We took it upon ourselves to use the situation as research for our own event, currently aimed at mid-summer next year (we&#8217;re still working on the exact date).<br />
Because the event was for three days, we hoped we might be able to save a little money by staying a night at Chateau Tisdale in Kelowna. Luckily, the Chateau&#8217;s owners were very accommodating, and loaned us use of the house, even though they were going to Waskesiu in Prince Albert National Park.<br />
I love my relatives.<br />
So on Friday afternoon, we threw our things into Allison&#8217;s &#8217;87 Toyota Corolla, shifted in gear, and headed directly to the Bay. I needed a shirt for the event, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to buy one yet. It was a nice light aquamarine (as close a colour as I can think of) and a tie (yes, a tie) to go with it. Then we were off &#8230; once we dropped off a library book.<br />
We drove until we reached outer Abbotsford, at which time we filled up on gas. It was a long drive to Kelowna, and the last think you want to have happen is run out of gas between Hope and Merritt &#8212; 120 kilometres of zilch civilization, and $20/litre gasoline. No, I&#8217;m not kidding &#8212; tow trucks will charge you that much, because there&#8217;s no other place to get it.<br />
Aside from a quick stop in Hope to obtain a small dinner, our next stop was in Merritt, where we were in need of something to drink. After you spend a significant amount of time on the coast, you&#8217;ll find your body requires more and more liquid when travelling in drier climates.<br />
As we departed Kelowna, I got a chance to look up at the sky Allison had commented on earlier. It was cool and clear that night &#8212; the clearest sky I have seen in over a decade. And dark. It was so dark that for the first time in since-I-don&#8217;t-know-when, I saw the Milky Way. Across the sky is usually a large whitish band, where we can see the rest of the galaxy. City lights drown it out completely &#8230; but not at 1,100 metres in the dead of night. We pulled over for a while and stared up at the night sky.<br />
Kelowna was cold when we arrived, barely in the teens (we were used to low 20s back in Vancouver). After finding the key stashed in the backyard, we found the house wasn&#8217;t much warmer. It seems my relatives had turned the heat off. Fine with me, as we were getting free accommodation. It just made using certain objects in the house (particularly those in the bathroom) a bit on the &#8230; breathtaking side.<br />
We rose late the night morning, groggy from our long trip. After quick romps through the shower, we headed out to find something to eat. Despite the fact that Kelowna is a neat little resort town, it has one little problem &#8212; a lot of things don&#8217;t open until later in the day. We had hoped to have Mexican for lunch. The only Mexican place we could find didn&#8217;t open until 4:00pm. We ended up at the Earl&#8217;s, overlooking the lake.<br />
Earl&#8217;s isn&#8217;t known for speed. This particular restaurant was stuck in what appeared to be an extension of the Kansas Interspatial Distortion (see Observer&#8217;s Log: Volume 3), where time slowed to a crawl. It took nearly an hour and a half to order, eat, and get our bill. We were 20 minutes late getting to &#8220;Salmon on the Beach&#8221;.<br />
This was the first of three wedding-related events (actually, four, if you count the ceremony and reception as separate). This was the get-together for all the people involved (including guests) in the wedding. There were between 120 and 150 people, but exact numbers were impossible to guess, because we didn&#8217;t know who was a guest and who wasn&#8217;t.<br />
Allison and I were among the youngest in the group, and felt mostly like outsiders. However, we were quickly welcomed by Heather&#8217;s mom, aunt, soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, and numerous other people. We certainly didn&#8217;t feel like outsiders by the end.<br />
The families had commandeered a park in the corner of Naramata, where they set up volleyball nets, horseshoe pits, picnic tables (all courtesy of the town), and food &#8230; lots and lots of food. All of it homemade. Grilled salmon, caught fresh in Port Alberni, along with fresh corn on the cob, salads of nearly every kind, and lots of fresh vegetables. Dessert was a selection of pies made from nearly every imaginable fruit. If you could fend off the wasps long enough, it was a good meal. (No-one was stung, to the best of my knowledge.)<br />
One of the more unexpected events was marked with a sign, reading &#8220;Irish Jigging&#8221;. They were referring to dancing, of course. Problem: &#8220;Jig&#8221; is a word used by the British to describe the Irish dancing. It does not mean the same thing in Ireland. In fact, it refers to the act of procreation. Not exactly what those who wrote the sign had in mind.<br />
We stayed until it was difficult to see the people playing volleyball. It was also so cold we could actually start seeing our breath (of course, that could have been from sucking in too much smoke from the bonfire). Apparently, the volleyball players continued to the point where they couldn&#8217;t see the ball.<br />
On the way back, we debated on what to do with the remainder of the evening. Both of us decided that a movie was in order. We hoped to be back in downtown Kelowna in time for a movie, but we weren&#8217;t certain we could make it. Luckily for us, we passed by the Westbank Caprice Theatres, which was showing a wide range of movies. Opting for the immediate guarantee of a movie, we stopped.<br />
We ended up seeing a rather appropriate film, insofar as the basic event that was to take place the following day &#8212; Runaway Bride, starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. Given, we didn&#8217;t expect to see Heather making a 100 metre dash away from the altar the next day, but we figured it would be good for a laugh.<br />
I&#8217;d just like to go on record: I didn&#8217;t suggest the movie. I merely agreed to it.<br />
Twenty dollars and two hours of our lives that we&#8217;ll never see again (Allison and I hit the &#8220;why are we watching this drivel&#8221; point at the same time, however we also realized that we had nothing else better to do, so we stayed and watched), we returned home, and promptly passed out.<br />
We were off and running early the next morning, making a direct hit on the De Dutch Pannekoek house. It was an experiment the both of us had been interested in performing. We had heard good things about the place, and thought it might be good for a test run. All in all, our spur-of-the-moment decisions to try something that weekend turned out fairly lousy &#8230; the breakfast included.<br />
I dropped Allison off at home, and quickly made a run to the Summerhill Winery, about a kilometre or so away from Chateau Tisdale. I figured that the loan of the entire house was worth at least two bottles of nice wine. Sadly, our once-favourite winery was nearly out of stock (the fall wine season is just about to start, and the spring lineup is almost gone). Remembering the St. Hubertus Winery not too far away, I made a hasty exit to check there.<br />
As usual, the St. Hubertus Winery was empty &#8230; of people, that is. It&#8217;s one of those little treasures that not many people know about. I knew exactly was I was looking for: a bottle of Oak Bay Gamay Noir (a very tasty red) and a recommended white wine. I learned something that day: Ageing wine in oak barrels means a lot. St. Hubertus has two flavours of Gamay Noir &#8212; one aged in stainless steel, the other in oak. The oak tastes significantly better. If the label says &#8220;Vinters Reserve&#8221;, you&#8217;ve got the *wrong* one.<br />
Returning after 20 minutes, toting two bottles of wine, I quickly got to work getting ready to leave. That meant showering, shaving, packing, and taking the wrinkles out of my new shirt. That was a challenge that completely amazed me. It took forever. Finally, after much work, the wrinkles were mostly removed, and we darted out the door. We were a bit pressed for time.<br />
The wedding was at 3:30 (or so said the invitation). That meant moving quickly, as it takes an hour (at least) to get from Kelowna to Naramata. This is mostly because of the zillion or so curves and dips along Naramata Road. Luckily, we were provided with a map that gave us the location. After thinking we might have got lost (we weren&#8217;t alone on that point), we found Heather&#8217;s grandparent&#8217;s house, half-way up the side of the mountain.<br />
Wow.<br />
Let me repeat that &#8212; wow.<br />
A nicer home, I have not seen. I couldn&#8217;t tell you when it was built, but someone made a careful plan to make sure that every possible vista was exploited. There isn&#8217;t one square inch on that property, in or out of the house, that doesn&#8217;t have a killer view.<br />
The ceremony was held on the spacious driveway/walkway that overlooked the lake and surrounding hillsides. Although it had been raining all day, the sun&#8217;s appearance only 30 minutes before was making the event a very memorable one.<br />
Brian and his entourage appeared roughly 10 minutes after we arrived, followed by Heather about five minutes later. The ceremony itself was short, lasting only about 15 minutes in total length. That&#8217;s not including the &#8220;intermission&#8221; in the middle, where Brian and Heather went off to sign the marriage licence, then returning to finish the ceremony. A little strange, if you ask me.<br />
Afterwards, we got into a receiving line to greet the wedding party and the newlyweds. This something that Allison and I are considering avoiding. It&#8217;s a long, drawn out detail that uses a lot of time that we think could be put to better use &#8230; like pictures, or getting from Point A to Point B (this all depends on where we have our photos taken, of course).<br />
Punch and hors d&#8217;oeuvres followed. Then it was back to Penticton for the reception at the Ramada. This gave us some time to whip through our hotel and drop our things off. We had checked in on our way up to Naramata, but didn&#8217;t want to spend the time unloading items. Not that it really mattered&#8230;<br />
The reception was more research for us. Allison had me take pictures of the cake, head table, and one of the guest tables for reference. We also realized that the room isn&#8217;t that big an issue &#8212; it really doesn&#8217;t dominate the atmosphere. We thought about how we would arrange people, where we would put food, what kind of drinks we would serve (and where we&#8217;d get them), and so on and so on.<br />
Our table mates included a couple who were loosely related to Heather (no blood relation at all, but were nonetheless a valued part of the family), named Micki and Donald. Yes, you read that right. They commented on the oddness of the two names. We noted it was a little weird that they didn&#8217;t go by something like Mick and Don. But hey &#8212; they&#8217;re not us.<br />
The dinner was quite nice, including a couple of salads (green, potato, and pasta), chicken kiev, roast beef, and buns. The cake was delicious, even though I had no idea what it was.<br />
When it finally came time to dance, the silliness started. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t hurt that about 50% of those attending were sufficiently inebriated. One in particular, one of Brian&#8217;s friends, claimed he was &#8220;a professional alcoholic&#8221;. This, as he bought nine beers and two rum and cokes (he was using up $50 he didn&#8217;t want to convert before returning to Ireland).<br />
Anyway, back to the dancing. Lots of people danced silly dances, including the dreaded &#8220;Chicken Dance&#8221;. That&#8217;s #1 of the top 10 songs I will try with all my might to keep out of our wedding. The Macarena comes in at #2. They played that, too. Dance I did not, owing to the severe pain my shoes were inflicting on my left little toe. Mental note for next year: Do not wear sandals in the week prior to the wedding &#8212; my toes are a little too splayed to fit into dress shoes properly.<br />
The reception ended around 1am, at which time we returned to our motel, and hit the sack.<br />
The next morning was supposed to be the brunch, where all those involved could scarf down a tasty way to start the day. We thought about the traffic we would face, and opted instead to get a head start on the mayhem. We didn&#8217;t avoid the idiots, though, nearly missing one such idiot as he tried to pass another car on a hill, with us next to a cliff. We had a maximum of two feet to spare between us. It really got the ol&#8217; heart pumping.<br />
The trip back signified the end of summer. As we climbed through the mountains, we noticed that it was dark and dreary &#8212; just what winter looks like around here. Then it started to rain. I wasn&#8217;t too concerned, it&#8217;s only water. After a moment, I noticed that the rain wasn&#8217;t splattering like rain &#8230; it was sleet. Not even before I said: &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s sleet!&#8221; did the sleet become snow. Not just a little snow, a *lot* of snow. So much snow that the windshield wipers gummed up, and we accumulated a bit on the car.<br />
Yes folks, when you see snow falling around you, you know summer&#8217;s over.<br />
We drove until we reached Abbotsford, where we pulled off for lunch. Again, our trend of turtle-paced service continued, for what reason we didn&#8217;t know. After an hour, we resumed our trek west.<br />
Our option to leave early paid off, we avoided the traffic we had dreaded. We pulled into our parking garage, and let Allison&#8217;s car recover from its 1000+ km journey. The drive probably did it well, though &#8212; it&#8217;s primarily used for city driving.<br />
That evening, we went downtown to witness Mary, a band fronted by the sister of one of Allison&#8217;s friends. It was a good show, save for the volume differential between the drummer and the vocals (namely the former mostly drowned out the latter). Then it was home for a rest.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Stress. I hate it. It sucks the life right out of me, and leaves nothing but exhaustion and bad moods. In short, I don&#8217;t do well under a large amount of it for a long period of time. And when you consider that I haven&#8217;t been working weekends, I&#8217;m really wondering how I survived at Arkipelago for so long without going loony.<br />
That&#8217;s pretty much the direction I&#8217;m headed in now &#8212; loony. Rather, I was, until the weekend. I&#8217;ve been busting my rear as of late &#8230; actually, as of the last two months, trying to get about a dozen projects to completion. Of prominence was the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax credit report. It&#8217;s worth about 3/4 of a million to us, so needless to say, there&#8217;s a lot of pressure to get it done.<br />
And that&#8217;s the problem &#8212; pressure. I&#8217;m under way too much of it. So much so that I haven&#8217;t slept well in more weeks than I can remember, and what little time I&#8217;ve had all to myself has been taken up by commuting from home to work and back.<br />
I need a vacation. Badly.<br />
Regrettably, my vacation won&#8217;t likely come until early October, when I plan to make a visit home. So until then, I take my rest time whenever I can get it. To compensate for my most recent bout of near-crazed stress, Allison and I opted to visit the Island for the weekend.<br />
Unlike our usual habit, we drove the car to the Island (via the ferry, of course). We caught the last ferry out of Vancouver, which unlike normal, was full of people returning from the PNE. Not a total surprise &#8212; getting to the PNE from the Island is a bit difficult, but not impossible for the determined.<br />
We arrived at the Collins&#8217; just around 11:30pm, at which time we sat down and talked for a while. Jane arrived after not too long, said &#8220;Hello&#8221; and promptly vanished. Randy came home not long after Jane, but stayed around to talk. Before long, it was well after 2:00am, and we were ready to pass out.<br />
The next morning, the house was virtually empty. The Collins were out with friends, and Allison&#8217;s siblings were nowhere to be found. It was time for us to vacate for our excursion of the day.<br />
The West Coast. Since I arrived in Vancouver in January of 1998, I hadn&#8217;t been to the west coast of Vancouver Island. Sounds a little odd, perhaps? While the Island is not very wide (only a hundred kilometres or so), there is no direct east-west highway. This is because of a small mountain problem.<br />
Getting to Tofino (one of our ultimate destinations) from Nanaimo requires a drive to Parkville, then to Port Alberni, then to Ucuelet, and finally to Tofino. All in all, it&#8217;s about 250 kilometres. There&#8217;s no way to do that in less than three hours.<br />
Unless you&#8217;re a raving lunatic, of course.<br />
The drive to Port Alberni is nice and easy &#8212; I&#8217;ve done most of it before (it&#8217;s the same route to Cathedral Grove). But once you&#8217;re out of Port Alberni, you&#8217;re into rough country. The roads weave, rise and fall like a roller coaster. The only difference is that you&#8217;re not attached to the track, and you have to deal with trains going in the opposite direction and trains trying to run you off the road.<br />
Since I&#8217;ve arrived here, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that BC has some of the worst drivers in Canada. At least in Montreal, everyone expects you to drive like a maniac. Many people have suggested that &#8220;flat-landers&#8221; (aka everyone who came from east of the Rockies) can&#8217;t drive here &#8212; they drive too fast, they take turns to quickly, yadda yadda yadda. Given, I see a lot of out-of-province license plates on cars driving so fast it would make Mario Andretti queasy. But my general fear is of the freaks that are living in this province.<br />
Anyway, we managed to finally get to Ucuelet shortly after 2:00pm. Starving, we found our way to a small grocery store to purchase snacks. We had thought of a restaurant, but Ucuelet (population: 5) isn&#8217;t well-stocked with interesting places to eat.<br />
Okay, all seriousness aside, Ucuelet is a nice place. To visit. I wouldn&#8217;t want to live there. Allison&#8217;s cousin, however, does. Her husband is the town planner. You might think: &#8220;Why would a town that small require a town planner?&#8221; The answer to that is our second destination: Tofino.<br />
Tofino was once like Ucuelet &#8212; small. Tiny. A blip on the map that you couldn&#8217;t get to without traversing gravel logging roads. It was an ordeal that few took. Then the government (bless their souls) paved the aforementioned logging road, and designated it Highway 4. Suddenly, getting from one side of the Island to the other was a bit easier. And Tofino was conveniently situated not far from Long Beach, which has some of the best surfing in Canada.<br />
That&#8217;s why Tofino got bigger. It got big fast. According to many who told me, Tofino also sprawled. It went commercial. It didn&#8217;t have that &#8220;west coast feel&#8221;. Ucuelet, only 40 kilometres away (and much closer to the Highway to Civilization) opted not to become an eyesore. Hence, the town planner.<br />
That being said, we figured Tofino had more to offer in terms of lunch, albeit a late one. So off we went.<br />
Between Ucuelet and Tofino is Pacific Rim National Park. It protects Long Beach and the surrounding area. There are several areas to visit in the park, but on that particular day, we were only interested in getting to Tofino.<br />
At first, I thought we had arrived in the outer limits of the town. From what others had told me, Tofino was a sprawling mess. I expected McDonald&#8217;s restaurants, gas stations &#8212; all the tacky stuff you&#8217;d expect to see in a tourist town. Frankly, I&#8217;d love to know what everyone complains about.<br />
Tofino is &#8230; quaint. Yes, quaint is exactly the word I&#8217;d use. It&#8217;s small, compact, with no real &#8220;strip&#8221; to speak of. It takes about a minute to travel from one side to the other. Then you&#8217;ve seen it, and you can move on with life.<br />
Tofino is more-or-less in the centre of Clayquot Sound. Name sound familiar? Remember all the protests a few years back? This was one of the centres for the protesters. Clayquot Sound has a lot of temperate rainforest &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest in North America, logged areas not included. It&#8217;s also the wettest &#8230; 20 feet a year. Luckily, we only got drizzled on.<br />
Lunch being the major concern, we drove around briefly (like I said, the town is small), until we spotted the Sea Shanty. Perhaps not the most elegant name, but they serve a mean shrimp caesar wrap. Not that I ate one &#8212; Allison did, complete with the fanciest salad I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. I opted for a rather large bowl of clam chowder (not that I had the intention of ordering a large bowl, it just came that way) and a small caesar salad. Both of us were quite content with our meals, especially considering how cheap they were.<br />
So, there&#8217;s my commercial for this issue &#8212; if you&#8217;re in Tofino and you&#8217;re hungry, go for the Sea Shanty.<br />
Afterwards, we wandered about a bit, checking out some of the local stores, before we ended up at the Eagle Aerie Gallery. This is Roy H. Vickers&#8217; personal art gallery. Roy Vickers is possibly one of the most famous (living) artists on the West Coast. He lives and works here, living in some remote town on the Island, with his gallery in Tofino.<br />
He&#8217;s a Tsimshian artist who creates beautiful artwork with Native themes. His artwork frequently requires the use of special lighting so you get the full effect (sometimes you can&#8217;t see a feature unless you&#8217;re looking in the right angle). Allison and I would love to buy a print of his, except we can&#8217;t spare the $3000.<br />
Upon exiting, Allison suggested we go to Long Beach. The sun was beginning to break through the oppressive cloud cover, so a trip to the beach seemed like a good idea.<br />
Long Beach is aptly named &#8212; it&#8217;s a few miles in length. But don&#8217;t be mistaken &#8212; this isn&#8217;t your average beach. In fact, this isn&#8217;t your average coast. The west coast of Vancouver Island is quite dangerous. There are vicious rip currents, rogue waves, and storms that make The Blair Witch Project look like Barney and Friends reunion. Many people are killed each year who don&#8217;t heed warnings or take the right precautions.<br />
The water is also cold. About 52F (11C) degrees. Unless you&#8217;re wearing a wetsuit, it&#8217;s not the sort of thing you want to be splashing around in for any length of time. Of course, that didn&#8217;t stop Allison or I from romping around the waves &#8230; so long as they didn&#8217;t pass our knees.<br />
But even at such a shallow depth, you can feel the rip current. Normally, when you stand in the sand where waves hit the beach, the sand under your feet is eaten away and you sink. That effect is very pronounced at Long Beach. Still, there were many people out surfing in the waves.<br />
We stayed only about 45 minutes, realising that if we stayed much longer, it would be dark by the time we got back to Nanaimo &#8212; and the trip back isn&#8217;t one you want to take in the dark.<br />
We stopped for a short while in Port Alberni, partially because we wanted to see the infamous channel. This is a large fjord that runs more than half-way into Vancouver Island. Originally, it didn&#8217;t quite go all the way through to Port Alberni, but some simple dredging and blasting took care of that. Now Port Alberni is actually a shipping port, allowing ships to avoid the bottlenecks at Vancouver Harbour.<br />
Returning to Nanaimo, we found we were unable to find a restaurant to suit our culinary desires. As such, we ended up back at the Collins, ordering Domino&#8217;s Pizza. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, of course.<br />
The next morning, I was awakened by the sound of a ringing telephone. At the time I didn&#8217;t know it, but it was in fact Allison doing a loop-back call with the phone so she wouldn&#8217;t have to go downstairs and wake me up. She was lucky that I was ready to get up anyway &#8212; I would&#8217;ve probably gone back to sleep, otherwise.<br />
We were out of the house about five minutes later, heading to Wellington Hall. Mrs. Collins wanted to experiment with some ideas for the wedding.<br />
Oh yeah, you probably wonder about that, eh? We put it off, due to some extenuating circumstances, and have rescheduled for next year, either in late July or early September (August is out due to Allison&#8217;s cousin, who is also getting married), depending on whether Allison decides to do her Masters or not.<br />
We&#8217;ll let you know.<br />
Anyway, we then ended up in Wedding Research mode, visiting several places around Nanaimo before finally giving up for the day. Still not enough decisions, but we&#8217;re not too pressed for time.<br />
Getting home was another issue. We hoped to make the 7pm ferry &#8230; along with about 500 other cars. We ended up in a line the lengths of which I hadn&#8217;t even imagined, let alone experienced. Surprisingly enough, it went fairly quickly, and we managed to make the special 8pm sailing (BC Ferries will run periodic special runs when traffic is high).<br />
It was a Fast Ferry. Yay. It wasn&#8217;t as bad as our previous experience, but then again, the Fast Ferry excels at the Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay run &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have to turn around.<br />
Soon, we were home, resting up for another week of solid work. Next week &#8212; off to Naramata for a wedding. Yep, another log entry&#8217;s a-coming&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another birthday has come and gone, and save for a minor panic attack when I realised I wasn&#8217;t 21 anymore (yes, that <em>actually</em> happened, believe it or not), I&#8217;m doing okay.<br />
Things got off to a start on Friday, when Pure3D (my group at the office) went out to celebrate two birthdays &#8212; mine (obviously), and Neall, who is exactly one day older than me. (Although Neall&#8217;s birthday was the day before, we really didn&#8217;t get our act in gear to go out for lunch that day; we rolled two birthdays into one.)<br />
I was supposed to go to a softball game that night, but I opted not to go, rather wanting to spend some time with Allison doing something other than sitting at home, working on the computer or watching a movie. (No, we haven&#8217;t been out a lot as of late.)<br />
After making a quick trip to Burnaby to pick up Allison, we came downtown to go to our favourite Greek restaurant, Olympia, on Denman St. (Yes, Allison could have come downtown and saved me the trip, but I didn&#8217;t make up my mind until I got home.) Tyler joined us towards the end of our evening meal (having already had his dinner).<br />
The three of us wandered about the Denman Street area for a while, before ending up at Death By Chocolate for dessert. (It&#8217;s actually kiddie-corner to Olympia, but we didn&#8217;t want to stuff ourselves any fuller at the time.) Following dessert, we adjourned to Tyler&#8217;s place to continue with our in-depth conversation. Unfortunately, we strayed back onto the dreaded Theory of Relativity issue (see [[Canada Day in Kelowna, Winery Tours, and Penticton]]).<br />
The next morning, we headed out on our adventure of the day. For my birthday, Allison was taking me on the Royal Hudson. The Royal Hudson is a train of vintage cars driven by a steam-powered locomotive built in 1940. The locomotive is a 4-6-4 Hudson, number 2860. King George VI was very impressed by the locomotive&#8217;s performance when he and Queen Elizabeth (aka the Queen Mother) travelled across Canada by train in 1939. He bestowed the designation of &#8220;Royal&#8221; on the engine.<br />
Well, that&#8217;s what they tell tourists. In reality, CP applied for permission to use the royal crowns and the &#8220;Royal&#8221; moniker to increase revenues by promoting a &#8220;royal&#8221; train. In fact, the entire 2860 class (numbers 2860-2864) all had the designation &#8220;Royal&#8221;.<br />
Despite its Royal lineage, the locomotive was taken out of service in the 50s, and put on freight service until the mid-60s. At that point, she was destined for museums. In the early 70s, enthusiasts convinced BC Rail that they should resurrect the Royal Hudson, and put it into regular service as a tourist train. The Royal Hudson now runs between May and October, running a short length of BC Rail&#8217;s track (BC Rail is the third largest Canadian railway after CP and CN) between North Vancouver and Squamish.<br />
We arrived about 15 minutes before departure, and hastily took our place on board in the end car, where we would have brunch. A few minutes later, the train softly lurched forward, and we were off.<br />
This part of the trip I had been on before &#8212; Allison had taken me on the Pacific Starlight last year (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]). Unlike the Starlight, however, this was a day-time excursion, and the trip ended in Squamish, not in Porteau Cove.<br />
Brunch began with a fruit cup, made of chunks of watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and pineapple. We finished the cup just before entering West Vancouver. Apparently, we weren&#8217;t supposed to eat while waving to all the onlookers.<br />
The Royal Hudson, like most steam trains, attracts a lot of attention, even if the train makes two trips through West Van every day. It&#8217;s the only train allowed to blow its whistle. Another bizarre bylaw makes everyone wave at the train as it goes by, which forces everyone on the train to wave back.<br />
As we approached Horseshoe Bay, we were treated to the entrée: A large piece of freshly broiled salmon (it was about 1.5&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 5&#8243; in size). It rested on a thin slice of fresh focaccia bread, over a baby green salad with basalmic vinaigrette. The salmon was very good. Allison debated over whether it was better than last year&#8217;s salmon. It was certainly different &#8212; Allison thought it was better, whereas I thought it was on par; I thought last year&#8217;s fish was excellent.<br />
Dessert arrived around Porteau Cove &#8212; trifle. Unlike my father&#8217;s, which has a bottle of brandy (or sherry &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember which is it) at the bottom, this was cake, fruit, and custard. It was very tasty. This isn&#8217;t to say that my father&#8217;s trifle isn&#8217;t tasty &#8212; goodness knows he *loves* it &#8212; but this one was alcohol-free.<br />
Arriving in Squamish, we had several options. BC Rail makes a point of flogging the tourism on the Royal Hudson as much as possible. They even go so far as to hire tour operators to come on board and convince people to go on tours around Squamish, including a trip to Shannon Falls, a river-rafting tour, or flights over the nearby glacier. All of them are designed to fit into the two hours you have before the train departs.<br />
We opted for the tour that came with the price of the ticket &#8212; a visit to the West Coast Railway Heritage Museum, operated by the West Coast Railway Association. To get there, we piled into a vintage 1950s bus, which had scarcely put on 170,000 miles, and were whisked away to a train-lover&#8217;s paradise.<br />
The WCRHM is a 12 acre park, not far from the downtown terminus for Squamish. It sits just to the side of the main north-south BC Rail lines, facilitating easy delivery of new acquisitions.<br />
The park has many examples of old rolling stock (rail cars, passenger cars) and locomotives. It has the only remaining PGE steam train (the other two are lying at the bottom of lakes), one of the original diesel locomotives used to haul CP&#8217;s Canadian transcontinental train, and even a vintage 1890 business car (the equivalent of today&#8217;s LearJets).<br />
Trains aren&#8217;t Allison&#8217;s cup of tea, that much I&#8217;m certain of. But she let me have my day, even allowing me the joy of riding on a miniature railway (which cost a mere dollar per person). I enjoyed the whole day so much, I&#8217;m seriously considering joining the WCRA as a volunteer. Railways are a huge part of our modern society&#8217;s past, and I want to help them have a future.<br />
Filing back onto another bus, we returned to the Royal Hudson at about 1:15. As we couldn&#8217;t board until 1:30, I took the opportunity to take some pictures of the engine and the train. In fact, I took an entire roll of film that day. (Those of you who don&#8217;t know me that well should know that this isn&#8217;t an unusual thing for me &#8212; I tend to be a bit shutter-happy.)<br />
The return trip was almost as good as the trip up. This time, we were one car behind the engine. The whole way back, I could hear the chugging of the engine. Several times I went to the vestibules (the &#8220;doors&#8221; to enter the cars from the platform) to stick my head out and listen. I&#8217;m still washing out bits of sand and carbon from my hair&#8230;<br />
I was almost disappointed when we arrived back in North Vancouver, the trip over. Those trips always seem to go too quickly. We climbed down from the train, and make our way towards our car. The next stop was Horseshoe Bay, and off to the Island.<br />
Arriving at the Bay, I quickly noticed a problem &#8212; there was very little parking. In fact, after dropping off Allison and driving around a bit, I realised that there was no parking at all. Impark (the parking Nazis in the Lower Mainland) had even gone so far as to deny ferry passengers parking rights at one of the major lots.<br />
At first, I didn&#8217;t think we would make that ferry. Parking was limited. Luckily for us, at the time I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d make it, the ferry traffic was beginning to clear out. In other words, parking spots. Unluckily for us, it was in the most expensive lot: $10 a day.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo, we were picked up by the Collins (as usual) and taken home. Allison and I then stepped out for a while for dinner, allowing me to develop the pictures I&#8217;d taken earlier in the day.<br />
Returning home, I was ambushed by the Collins with a steam locomotive-shaped chocolate cake. Yes, I was a very happy camper that night. I had everything I wanted for my birthday &#8230; except my own family and friends, that is. Luckily for me, most of them sent me cards (both the traditional and the newer electronic variety).<br />
The next day was the day we had come to the Island for: The Comox Air Show. No, this is not a regular Collins (or Vailmont) family event. The only reason we were going (in fact, the only reason I knew there was a Comox Air Show) was Allison&#8217;s uncle Sean.<br />
Sgt. Sean Moran is one of an elite skydiving team called the &#8220;Skyhawks&#8221;. They&#8217;re the parachuting equivalent to the Snowbirds. Sean was one of eight people selected for a year&#8217;s service with the squad. Since May, he&#8217;s been jumping all over North America, including a drop in Oakville on 22 June.<br />
Piling into the Collins&#8217; Honda, we hit the road for the 1.5 hour trip to Comox. Upon arriving, we had another 1.5 hour wait until we got in. Unfortunately, we had taken the &#8220;front&#8221; door route &#8212; the one that was clearly marked. This was the &#8220;opposite&#8221; route to how Gerry and I had gone two years ago &#8212; the &#8220;back&#8221; route.<br />
So, along with about 10,000 other cars, we waited our turn to get into CFB Comox&#8217; field. At one point, we sat for a long time without moving. At first, I thought it was because there were complete idiots who didn&#8217;t know how to organise traffic. I would later find out it was because Allison&#8217;s Aunt Valerie&#8217;s friend Peter&#8217;s car broke down. He would later drive by us on his way home to get it fixed.<br />
Around 12:15, we finally reached the fence surrounding the field. A Buffalo (aircraft, not a mammal) circled above us. As we approached the gate, it dumped three streamers, which fell slowly to the ground. I suspected that it was to test the wind conditions for the Skyhawks. I was right &#8212; little did we know at the time, but Sean and crew were all in the Buffalo, waiting to jump.<br />
Before I progress any further, I should clear something up. Sean is younger than you think he is. He is married to Allison&#8217;s aunt Linda, who is only five years older than Allison &#8212; Sean&#8217;s only about five years older than me. Just in case some of you thought he&#8217;s some old geezer leaping from planes for a kick&#8230;<br />
Finally arriving in the base, we took a few minutes to stroll about. We went past some F-16s, some A-10s (which, last I heard, had been decommissioned), gliders, a C5 Galaxy, a couple of helicopters, and a small city worth of people.<br />
On our way to the field to sit and watch, the show started with one of the Skyhawks floating into the field, carrying an American flag underneath him. (Don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s good reason for this &#8212; it was an &#8220;international&#8221; air show, which means the US Air Force had supplied a few planes for show.) He was quickly followed by another Skyhawk carrying a Canadian flag. This was kind of redundant, since all the Skyhawks have Canadian flag parachutes.<br />
Aside: For those of you who watch &#8220;Due South&#8221;, you may remember a series of Mounties who parachuted into the frozen north in the final episode, all with Canadian flag parachutes. I&#8217;ll give you two guesses who did the actual jumps. And no, Sean wasn&#8217;t with them at the time.<br />
No sooner had we taken our position that the next few Skyhawks came down, from a distance of 10,000 feet. The first few came in a stacked tower formation (one on top of the other). Another came down carrying smoke canisters under him. He flew into a spiral (on purpose) to create a &#8220;candy cane&#8221; swirling effect.<br />
Four more skydivers formed a diamond with their parachutes, at which point we heard Sean&#8217;s name come over the PA system. Although we cheered, we didn&#8217;t hear anyone else &#8212; I&#8217;d hoped we&#8217;d be able to hear the others cheer. As it turns out, finding them wasn&#8217;t a problem. I just followed Sean to where he landed &#8212; the rest of the family was there, waiting.<br />
Most of the family (at least from what I gather) was nervous &#8212; after all, he was jumping out of plane. How many people do that in the right minds? I, however, wasn&#8217;t the least bit worried. Now, this could partly be because I&#8217;d only seen Sean twice, and really don&#8217;t know him that well. However, I also knew that these were consummate professionals, who didn&#8217;t like taking risks. The odds of something going wrong were reasonably slim.<br />
After Sean collected his parachute, he and the rest of the team bounded over the fence (as well as someone carrying 30lbs of parachute can bound) and held an impromptu demonstration of how to pack a parachute back up. It was rather fascinating. We basically ignored the rest of the air show until Sean left, to go see the sponsors.<br />
Sean would return later in the show, taking Allison&#8217;s grandfather to the area reserved for base personnel and their family for a surprise presentation. I tagged along to take pictures.<br />
Sean had the Skyhawks sign a special poster, and place a sticker that said &#8220;Happy 80th Ernest&#8221;. In a quick ceremony, the captain of the team presented the poster to Allison&#8217;s grandfather, who was quite touched by the gesture.<br />
Skyhawks are brutally nice. Of course, they have to be &#8212; their ambassadors for the Canadian Armed Forces. They are effectively in media relations. Sean&#8217;s quite good at it, too. He rather likes it, so he told me. They were so nice as to sign brochures for us. Sean goes down as the first person I&#8217;d ever asked for an autograph.<br />
The Snowbirds were the last event of the show. In typical Snowbird-style, they put on a great show. We didn&#8217;t stay around for the whole event, however, as we had to catch a ferry home. We ducked out while they were still flying about. It almost felt like the Snowbirds were running cover for us as we drove out the exit.<br />
We returned to Nanaimo and prepared to leave for the ferry. We lucked out with another Ferry Classic, which meant we&#8217;d have good seating. Our trip was even complete with celebrities. Rather, celebrity.<br />
As I returned from the galley with empty hands (they had no frozen yoghurt on that trip), I caught the face of an elderly Asian man walking in my direction. It took me only a moment to realise that it was David Suzuki. <em>The</em> David Suzuki. Mr. Nature of Things. Allison was looking at me, her eyes bugged open, nodding vigorously, as if in agreement with the question I was apparently supposed to be asking, namely: &#8220;Is that who I think it is?&#8221;<br />
Upon reaching Horseshoe Bay, we exited the ferry, found the car, and dragged ourselves home.<br />
It&#8217;s been a busy few weeks, and we haven&#8217;t had a chance to slow down. Both Allison and I were exhausted when we got home. Although we had been planning to see the Nanaimo Bathtub Races this weekend, we&#8217;re probably not going to go, opting for some rest.<br />
Besides, it&#8217;s my turn to clean the apartment this weekend&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Life&#8217;s a beach.<br />
At least, it should be.<br />
Last weekend was the second busy weekend for Allison and I, the second weekend of the month we weren&#8217;t home. We won&#8217;t be home for a weekend probably until mid-August at the pace things are currently going. Every weekend has something new for us to explore. Frankly, this is a good thing &#8230; provided the weather holds out.<br />
We left on Friday night, meeting at Horseshoe Bay. Knowing that traffic would be a nightmare, Allison left from the apartment early. I left downtown on the 5:07 express to Horseshoe Bay, arriving a mere five minutes before Allison.<br />
We dropped the car off at the Park and Ride, which the local Lion&#8217;s Club. Normally, the lot is free, you just have to walk the kilometre or so to the ferry terminal. When the Lion&#8217;s are about, you have to pay a paltry $5/day (a bargain compared to the other lots), and you get a free ride to the terminal.<br />
We were somewhat excited to find that we would be taking one of the mythical Fast Ferries, the first of which went into service on 1 July. It was supposed to leave at 18:00. We boarded it at 18:07. Needless to say, the Fast Ferry hasn&#8217;t been running exactly up to snuff just yet&#8230;<br />
The Fast Ferry is a catamaran with twin water jet propulsion systems. They run at a supposed 45 knots, making the trip in just under an hour. Supposedly. In actuality, it runs at about 37 knots, and in the long run, might save you about five minutes, all told. Why?<br />
Because we let the government design it, that&#8217;s why.<br />
All fairness aside, they did try. But as Yoda once said: &#8220;Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.&#8221; The design would work well for longer-haul trips. However, the design is not exactly well-suited to the short jaunts across the Strait. You see &#8212; the ship points in only one direction.<br />
Why is that significant? All the other ships point in two directions, allowing them to be driven from either end. No turning, no slowing down to back in; just straight-forward (no pun intended) driving. The Fast Ferry is a uni-directional ship. It has to be turned around before it can go anywhere. It needs a dollar to turn on a dime.<br />
This means that for one leg of the trip, the ship has to turn around at both ends &#8212; otherwise, the cars can&#8217;t get off without backing up themselves. As it stands, it takes too long to empty the ship without people having to drive off in reverse.<br />
And the wake. Homeowners around Bowen Island (which the ferries all pass) have been shocked at the near-tsunami conditions that the ferry generates. It threatens to rip up docks and smash boats against the shore. BC Ferries contends that the wake is minimal.<br />
Minimal, my heiny&#8230;<br />
On the way back, we were on a good ol&#8217; regular ferry. When the Fast Ferry rocketed past us, it sent our ship rocking &#8212; the only time in dozens of crossing that Allison and I have been on where I could actually feel the ship rock due to waves.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me started on the interior &#8220;features&#8221; either. I&#8217;ll just leave my opinion at this: The government would have been far better off spending the money on upgrading our existing ferries and making sure that the less-travelled (but still necessary) routes don&#8217;t suffer due to lack of funds. Heck, you could have built two regular ferries for the price it cost to build one Fast Ferry.<br />
And there are two more coming off the assembly line.<br />
Anyway, we arrived in Nanaimo about one hour and 20 minutes after we left West Vancouver and proceeded to the Collins Family Estate, in the prestigious Divers Lake area. There we were subdued by the plethora of relatives who had descended on the household for the weekend.<br />
It was Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s 80th birthday party. The second one. As you may recall (see [[Snow in Vancouver, Dinner on the Island]]), we had already attended a birthday party at The Grotto in Nanaimo. However, it wasn&#8217;t exactly suitable for a large get-together of friends, so the official party was postponed until the weekend past.<br />
The following morning, we rose and dressed for the occasion. Although not a formal event, we were obviously not going to show up in loud pink shirts and spandex shorts, so we dressed in beige pants and blue shirts.<br />
I&#8217;m not kidding. We really did.<br />
This, of course, was an accident. Neither Allison or I had heard each other the night we packed to leave &#8212; we had inadvertently packed virtually the same outfit. This is not just a fashion faux pas &#8212; it looks really weird. So avoid confusion and embarrassment, I raided Randy&#8217;s closet for a different shirt. It turned out that I grabbed a shirt that Randy had never worn &#8212; it has just been given to him from Mr. Collins. Luckily, though, it fit.<br />
Overall, it was a good party, although Allison and I didn&#8217;t move around too much, we spent most of our time talking to old friends of family (that I didn&#8217;t know), cousins, and Grandma Collins. We didn&#8217;t really know many others.  Late in the afternoon, Grandma Vailmont (the one basically running the whole show) abducted me to play bocci.<br />
Bocci is a bit of a religion there. You can&#8217;t escape it. If you go to a Vailmont family get-together, you&#8217;ll probably end up playing bocci. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t know how &#8212; you&#8217;ll learn. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you don&#8217;t like it &#8212; you will. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you have no arms &#8212; someone will throw for you. Resistance is futile.<br />
I ended up on a team with Janet, Mrs. Collins&#8217; cousin, and two of Allison&#8217;s cousins, Kersten (9) and Mitchell (4). Both are young. Like most siblings, they fight a fair bit.<br />
I will wholeheartedly admit that I forgot was sibling rivalry was like &#8212; it had been a very long time since my sister and I had a good screaming match. (We now sit around the kitchen table, drink beer, and discuss finances. My how the times change.)<br />
It was exceptionally difficult to play a close game. If one side got too far ahead, one of the two siblings would be upset. Janet and I got very good at placing balls close to the marker ball, and far away from the marker ball. We adjusted our strategies depending on the accuracy of the younger two&#8217;s throws. In the end, Mitchell (the younger of the two) won by a mere point. Kersten, despite losing, was not upset.<br />
When the party finally ended, it took those of us remaining only a short period of time to clean everything up. As we retreated to the Collins Family Estate, Vicki (one of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters) announced a barbeque at Rathtrevor Beach the following day.<br />
Rathtrevor Beach is the Bay of Fundy of the west coast &#8230; only horizontal. Whereas the Bay of Fundy has very high tides, Rathtrevor Beach has very long tides. If you arrive at the beach at low tide, you&#8217;ll find yourself walking well over a kilometre to find water &#8230; even further to find water deep enough to come up to your neck (assuming you stand 5&#8242; 11 7/8&#8243;).<br />
At any rate, the beach is huge. Gigantic. Enormous. And despite the number of people who show up, virtually empty. This leads to things such as sandcastles, kite-flying, and lots of people walking aimlessly. In short, typical beach-going behaviour.<br />
Upon arriving at the beach, we had to take Kersten and Mitchell out onto the beach &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t wait. Mind you, neither could I. The last time I was on an ocean beach (or a saltwater beach, depending on how you look at it) for the purposes of sitting in the sun and doing beach-related things was in 1991. (Yes, I know I went to the beach in Monterey last year, but it was way too cold to even consider swimming.) It had been a long time since I had walked across a good beach.<br />
And boy, do you every have a long walk. Because the beach is so expansive, it also has a lot of interesting features, most notably tidal pools. Although devoid of fish, the pools have lots of shellfish, crabs, and snails. You can imagine the kids&#8217; reaction to those. Most revolved around &#8220;cool&#8221; and &#8220;ewwww!&#8221;. Allison, Robin (another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters), and Wilma (yet another of Mrs. Collins&#8217; sisters, who lives in Germany) gave out marine biology lessons to those of us not quite up-to-snuff with the proper information. While I&#8217;m at, I&#8217;ll mention Mrs. Collins&#8217; last unmentioned sibling, Laura &#8212; Kersten and Mitchell are her children.<br />
What do you associate sand dollars with? Tropical waters, right? Take a wild guess what thrives all over Rathtrevor Beach? Yep &#8230; thousands of &#8217;em. They&#8217;re everywhere. You can&#8217;t take any of them with you &#8212; that&#8217;s a no-no. But you can pick them up and see what they look like while they&#8217;re still alive. Black ones are living &#8230; the whitish ones have since deceased.<br />
Finally reaching the ocean, we waded in a little ways and splashed around a bit. Baby flatfish (halibut or flounders, probably) skitted about our feet, trying to get away from the two-footed giants traipsing through the middle of their sanctuary.<br />
A few minutes later, we realised that the water was about to soak all the things we&#8217;d left on shore to stay dry. The tide was turning, and beginning to reclaim the shore. It was time to go back for lunch.<br />
After partaking in much the same food as we&#8217;d had the day before, several of us ventured back out onto the beach to build a sandcastle. Initially just Brenna, Kersten, and Mitchell, I soon followed, with several others not far behind. The construction was hasty, mostly because the tide was coming in fairly quickly.<br />
As Brenna build the castle with Kersten and Mitchell, I quickly built an outer wall, designed to keep the water away for a short period of time. The wall wouldn&#8217;t hold the water out indefinitely, but it would at least make for a more interesting destruction of the castle.<br />
Sure enough, the water soon arrived, so Kersten and Mitchell took refuge in their sandy kingdom &#8230; for a few precious minutes. Eventually, the tide ate away at the walls, no thanks to the surrounding adults who were surreptitiously splashing the walls, hastening their demise. The flood inside the walls soon took down the castle&#8217;s structure, ending the brief reign of King Mitchell and Queen Kersten.<br />
Following a short swim in the now-flooded beach, we packed up and headed home. Although we could have made the 19:00 ferry to Vancouver, Allison and I waited until the 21:00. In retrospect, this was a good idea &#8230; we would have travelled on a Fast Ferry, and we all know what I think of them.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Deciding that the weather here had become too unbearable to stand for another weekend, let alone a long weekend, Allison and I opted to abdicate the Lower Mainland for places sunnier.<br />
At least, that was the plan.<br />
I booked Friday off (don&#8217;t you just hate it when the holiday lands on anything but Friday or Monday?), we packed a few things into a cooler (namely the two tonnes of fruit we received in our organic vegetable delivery &#8212; yes, I know I&#8217;m turning into a hippie), and started driving towards the Okanagan.<br />
Within a couple of hours, we noticed that the rain was beginning to slowly subside. At first, we managed to elude Mother Nature. Every time I said &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s some blue sky!&#8221;, she figured out where we had disappeared to, and covered over all vestiges of the sun.<br />
Arriving in Merritt shortly after noon, we stopped for lunch and a rest break. Having been chastised for jinxing the weather earlier in the trip, I had not said one word about the conditions. As a result, Mother Nature lost track of us again, and the weather was warm and bright. A bit windy too, so we ate lunch in the car for fear of blowing away with the tumbleweeds.<br />
Leaving the Coquihalla highway behind us, we headed towards the Okanagan Valley. This trip, roughly an hour from Merritt, is plagued with many dangers: Severe Winter Weather, tight corners, and many examples of &#8220;driverius moronicus&#8221;. One particular specimen opted to pass three cars (of which I was the lead) right in front of on-coming traffic. The on-coming traffic had to bolt over to the shoulder to prevent a head-on collision. If I had not noticed this happening, we could probably have been in an accident. Had I been a bit quicker, I would have gladly jotted down the turkey&#8217;s license and turned him into the RCMP&#8230;<br />
Arriving alive and unscathed in Kelowna around 1:30pm, we headed in the direction of my relative&#8217;s home. While in Kelowna, we were staying at the luxurious Chateau Tisdale, situated near the shores of Lake Okanagan. Thinking that both my aunt and uncle were working, I thought it best that we show up a bit later.<br />
This gave us the opportunity to sight see a little.<br />
Our first stop was the Kettle Valley planned community. This is a development that some genius thought up a few years ago. On a rather large chunk of land just south of Kelowna, developers are building a very large community, complete with town centre, schools, and character homes. In fact, the entire development is full of character &#8212; Victorian-style homes currently dot the area.<br />
The development is far from complete. It will probably take 20 years or more to finish the development. But it will be very nice when it&#8217;s full of families.<br />
We stopped into the office and one of the show homes to see what it was like. In addition to being considerably cheaper than homes in the Lower Mainland, the homes were high quality, and very nice. We were a bit surprised that none of the salespeople gave us the hard sell. We weren&#8217;t sure if it was because that was their style, or if it was because we looked too young. (We always get the hard sell out here.)<br />
From the Kettle Valley development, we headed back towards my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home. Along the way, we opted to stop into the Summerhill Winery. (So we found out, it&#8217;s a law that all tourists have to stop into at least one winery while in the Okanagan. We had somehow managed to avoid it the first couple of times, but didn&#8217;t want to run the risk of a large fine for breaking the law this time.)<br />
As we rounded the corner, we saw the winery&#8217;s piece de resistance &#8230; a large white pyramid. I&#8217;ll get back to that in a moment or two&#8230;<br />
We pulled into the parking lot, and quickly found two things: 1) There was a free &#8220;sparking wine&#8221; tour, and 2) We missed lunch by about 10 minutes. We stuck around for the 3:00pm tour.<br />
Our tour guide, so we figured, was a ski hill enthusiast working for the summer. (Another weird BC law states that the wineries, in return for getting mandatory visits by all the tourists, also has to hire all the ski bums who can&#8217;t ski during the summer.) She was a good speaker, I will admit, although she did exhibit a bit of attitude.<br />
She took us around the winery, showing us the grapes Summerhill grows, the machines used to press the grapes &#8230; I&#8217;m going to pause here a moment. Interesting things to know about pressing grapes:<br />
Summerhill presses their grapes to roughly 65% of their volume (this is called the &#8220;first pressing&#8221;), then mulches the left overs (including the stems and leaves of the grapes), and puts it back out in the field as fertilizer. Other wineries go to a second pressing, and even a third pressing. The guide expressed her disdain for additional pressings, saying that other wineries weren&#8217;t concerned about quality if they went to these additional pressings. Although she wouldn&#8217;t name names, she did say that the third pressing was usually referred to as the &#8220;rotting grape&#8221;. &#8216;Nuff said.<br />
(Additional note, which I&#8217;ll add before Allison does: Fourth pressings usually become grape juice, and the leftovers are turned into fruit leather. Summerhill, obviously, does not do this.)<br />
Okay, where was I? Oh yeah, we saw the machines used to press the grapes, and then we went into the winery building to see where all the magic takes place. Sparking wine (technically, it *is* champagne, but because &#8220;champagne&#8221; is trademarked for wineries in the Champagne region of France, no-one outside that area can use the term &#8220;champagne&#8221;; look for &#8220;methode classique&#8221; instead) is a work-intensive beverage.<br />
After the wine is left in vats to ferment for a while, it is bottled and capped with bottle caps. They are then shelved for three years while the yeast eats up every scrap of sugar in the wine. (This is why champagne is so dry.) Then they have to &#8220;riddle&#8221; the bottles, which is the laborious part.<br />
First, the bottles are whacked against a rubber tire to loosen up all the yeast (which is now caked to one side of the bottle). All 10,000 bottles of a batch are placed in special riddling racks, which starts the bottle out roughly horizontal. Each day, the riddler comes along, gives each bottle a quarter-turn, moving the bottle a little more vertical. (A riddler can riddle 10,000 bottles in 55 minutes.) By the end of the process, the yeast has collected in the neck of the bottle.<br />
Then the bottles are put into a glycol solution (only the first inch or so of the neck) to freeze the contents, including the leftover yeast. Then comes the fun part &#8212; removing the bottle cap. The caps keep the contents of the bottle under the pressure generated by the yeast&#8217;s by product: Carbon dioxide gas. 125 pounds per square inch of it.<br />
Needless to say, it&#8217;s a very messy process.<br />
The bottles are then topped up with a &#8220;dosange&#8221;, which guarantees 750ml of sparking wine, a little bit of sweet wine and a touch of yeast, and then the hasty corking (with a hefty cork, I might add).<br />
Definitely not a home-brew kind of project.<br />
Following bottling portion came the warehouse &#8230; the pyramid (told you I was getting back to this). It seems that the guy who set up the winery is a huge believer in the power of pyramids. (What can I say, other than the west coast attracts the weirdos.)<br />
There&#8217;s a theory that says a properly-designed pyramid will even out of the flow of tachyons (particles that move faster than the speed of light) and tardyons (particles that move slightly slower than the speed of light). Supposedly this is what causes the power of the pyramid. Instead of going sour, milk turns into yogurt; dull razors sharpen; meat petrifies rather than rots. Our guide suggested that was the reason why all the mummies in Egypt were petrified. I was about to suggest that it was because the bodies were drained of all decay-causing fluids, and then sat in natron (salt) for 40 days to dry it out &#8212; not to mention that most mummies were never in pyramids. But I kept quiet (yeah, I know, it&#8217;s a rarity).<br />
Supposedly, this makes the wine taste better. The winery had held taste tests a couple of years earlier, testing out the theory. Everyone who tasted a wine aged in a pyramid and the same wine aged normally chose the pyramid wine. Can&#8217;t tell you if it was fixed, but that&#8217;s what we were told.<br />
Then came the best part &#8230; the tasting. We were instructed how to taste wines (something which I had only partly known). If it&#8217;s a sparking wine, the first thing you do is look at the bubbles. They should be very small and fast-moving. This is the sign of a good sparking wine (or champagne). If the bubbles are large and lethargic, then you have something called &#8220;Baby Duck&#8221;. Yeah, it&#8217;s fake. If you don&#8217;t have a sparking wine, go to Step 2&#8230;<br />
Look at the clarity of the wine &#8212; it shouldn&#8217;t be cloudy. If it is, put the wine back in the bottle, take it back to the store, and have it replaced. You don&#8217;t want to be sucking back any yeast (that&#8217;s the cloudy stuff). It&#8217;s not lethal, but you&#8217;ll be wishing it was.<br />
Swirl the wine. Look at the film left on the glass. It should split into rivulets as it drains back into the wine. These are called &#8220;legs&#8221;. The thicker and slower the legs, the sweeter the wine. It&#8217;s not a precise measurement, but it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
Look into the glass, where the wine meets the glass itself. This thin barrier is called the &#8220;meniscus&#8221; (something I remember from Grade 7 science). If it&#8217;s a greenish colour (in white wine) or a brownish colour (in red wine), then the wine&#8217;s oxidized. That&#8217;s what you get for not drinking the whole bottle in one shot.<br />
Next you smell. I don&#8217;t know why, you just do. Assumedly, you&#8217;ll know if it smells bad.<br />
Finally, you get to taste it. But not really. Your first sip is rolled around in the mouth, covered all points and corners. You don&#8217;t pay attention to the taste, mostly because you have to orient your mouth to the new flavours of the wine. When you take your next sip, you&#8217;ll get a better idea of what the wine actually tastes like. You aerate the wine by (quietly) slurping it. I don&#8217;t know what this does exactly, but listening to 20 retired tourists do this is kinda funny.<br />
After you&#8217;ve done all this, you can finally drink the silly thing. You have to go through this process each time you switch wines, or you won&#8217;t get the full effect.<br />
Of course, that&#8217;s assuming you give a flying fig about all that&#8230;<br />
After the sparking wine (which was quite tasty, I will say), we tried two red and two white wines. Our favourite was the GewÃ«rztraminer. It&#8217;s a sweeter wine, and goes very well with spicy foods. Allison and I also tried their icewine after I made an inquiry as to whether they had any.<br />
Most people drink wines that vary from 0 to 2 in sweetness. Most people I know won&#8217;t drink anything above a 5 &#8212; it&#8217;s too sweet. The Summerhill Riesling Icewine is an 18. None of the wine-tasting techniques work on icewine, incidentally. And if you drink icewine, don&#8217;t try to drink anything else for about 30 minutes &#8212; you won&#8217;t taste a thing.<br />
Luckily, we weren&#8217;t close to being inebriated, so we could leave shortly thereafter. We arrived at the Tisdale&#8217;s around 4:30, and were promptly hugged to death by my aunt (she wasn&#8217;t working that day, as I had thought she might). No sooner than we were sitting in the kitchen did my uncle show up, claiming that their computers had crashed again, and he didn&#8217;t see the need to stick around any longer.<br />
We talked for a couple of hours before setting into dinner mode. The barbequing duties fell on myself, which meant I had to try and not burn the steaks. I got lucky, although they were a bit too much on the well done side. (Thick steaks on an unfamiliar barbeque make for difficult work.)<br />
After dinner, we headed out for the fireworks. This entailed driving down to Kelowna&#8217;s downtown, finding a place to park, and then walking to the appropriate viewing place.<br />
So we walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
And walked.<br />
Did I mention we walked a lot?<br />
We walked.<br />
Finally, we stopped not far from the north end of town (or so it seemed), just as the fireworks got underway. Not the most spectacular show I&#8217;d seen, but it was far better than the slop Vancouver had put on the year before. It was no Symphony of Fire, but it wasn&#8217;t too bad.<br />
Following the show, we fought through the 50,000 or so people who turned out to get back to the car, and back home. We passed out within moments of hitting the pillows.<br />
We woke up the next morning to the sound of &#8220;Breakfast!&#8221; being bellowed by my uncle. We crawled out of bed and worked our way into the kitchen, to a meal of fried eggs, oranges, toast, superbly-cooked bacon, and cherries. It was a great way to start the day &#8230; especially since Mother Nature had found us again, and clouded everything over.<br />
Before I knew it, my uncle was gone. It wasn&#8217;t long before it was our turn. We bade my aunt good-bye, and then hit the road.<br />
The trip to Penticton is only about 45 minutes, and is a nice drive. Upon arriving, we hunted down our motel &#8212; the Majestic Motor Inn. Yes, the name is cheesy. So&#8217;s the interior of the room. The building was put up in the early 60&#8217;s (by my estimate). The interior hasn&#8217;t changed since then. It was almost fun (except our next door neighbour was a bit freaky).<br />
One of the reasons we were going to Penticton was to meet up with our friends, Lisa and Miran. (Lisa one of Allison&#8217;s best friends; Lisa and Miran being an item; I know Miran from university, since before I met Allison. [Insert clip of &#8220;It&#8217;s a Small World, After All&#8221; here.]) Finding their room, we found that they were nowhere to be found. So off we went.<br />
Lunch was of the order, as it had been a few hours since breakfast. We stopped at a place called &#8220;Joe&#8217;s on the Beach&#8221;, which specialised in New Orleans-style cuisine (at least, as much as the fare of a beach-front greasy spoon could be called &#8220;cuisine&#8221;). For $15, we were certainly not in the complaining mood &#8212; the meal was tasty, although large.<br />
Returning to the outside, we couldn&#8217;t help but notice one thing: Penticton was dead. Here it was, the Canada Day weekend, and the vacation town of the Okanagan was deserted. There didn&#8217;t seem to be any real reason for it.<br />
We walked down the length of Lakeshore Drive, almost to the Peach (a refreshment stand on the waterfront). Deciding we needed some refreshement, not to mention some money, we headed down Winnipeg St. towards the downtown. In a few moments, we hit upon a 7-11.<br />
It had been a really long time since I sat in front of a convenience store, eating a creamsicle and drinking a slurpee. It was kind of like being a kid again. It felt good. It felt free. It felt really really cold when I drank the slurpee too fast and followed up with a large bit of the creamsicle. Lousy brain freeze.<br />
On the way back, we stopped into the Visitor and Wine Information Centre (Penticton is roughly in the middle of the entire wine-making area, so gets the coveted Info Centre as a result). We looked around, picked up a few brochures, and then headed back to the motel.<br />
We got together with Lisa and Miran that night, under the guise of going to a barbeque at the Lake Breeze Winery, in beautiful downtown Naramata. (For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Naramata is some dinky little place on the eastern side of Lake Okanagan. I don&#8217;t think it has anything but vineyards and orchards, let alone a downtown.)<br />
After zigging and zagging around the countryside a little, we came to the Lake Breeze Winery, only to find that the supposed barbeque wasn&#8217;t on. No explanation, no nothing. I got the feeling that we were the only ones who didn&#8217;t know.<br />
We stopped briefly at a lookout hill on the way back, which turned out to be the mountain that bears the large &#8220;Penticton&#8221; sign, visible from Highway 97 on the opposite side of the lake.<br />
We had dinner that night at Salty&#8217;s Beachside. It tries to take its ambience from the Caribbean. I stress &#8220;tries&#8221;. The food was decent, although nothing really to write home about (which is why I&#8217;m not really mentioning anything other that we ate there).<br />
Following dinner, we retreated to Lisa and Miran&#8217;s motel room to share a bottle of wine. I believe it was a Cabernet Sauvignon from Sumac Ridge, but I could be wrong. Either way, the wine and a discussion of the pyramid at Summerhill led us to one of the weirdest conversations I&#8217;ve ever had.<br />
Miran and I attempted (and mostly failed) to properly explain Einstein&#8217;s Special Theory of Relativity. For about two hours, we tried to explain properly why for a stationary observer, time seems to slow down for someone moving close to the speed of light. (It stands to reason that the person travelling at the speed of light will, in comparison to the stationary person, age less.)<br />
Finally giving up trying to explain it fully, Allison and I went home to sleep.<br />
The next morning, we rose slowly to weather that could be best described as &#8220;spotty&#8221;. Lisa and Miran were off to Oliver to find more wineries, so Allison and I opted to check out Sumac Ridge. The primary reason was because we liked the sound of the lunch we could get at their Cellar Door bistro.<br />
And believe me &#8212; that lunch is something to write home about. Pecan and cornmeal encrusted chicken breast with apricot chutney, served with fresh baby greens with a red wine vinaigrette. Based on a suggestion, we had a glass of 97 Gewurtztraminer. The meal was preceeded by a basket of fresh breads which were absolutely scrumptious. (There&#8217;s a word I&#8217;ll bet you didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d use.)<br />
Unfortunately, the wine had one minor problem &#8230; we were in no condition to drive anywhere. So we hopped onto the winery tour to work off the alcohol. We found that Sumac Ridge was one of the wineries Summerhill frowns upon &#8212; they do multiple pressings. (If you purchase Sumac Ridge, aim for bottles marked with &#8220;Special Reserve&#8221; &#8212; this is the batch from the first pressing.)<br />
Then it was through the coldest room I&#8217;ve ever been in. Allison and I nearly froze while our guide (another skiing enthusiast) explained why the wines were chilled to near freezing. They were settling out the yeast and a susbstance that sometimes is used in making tartar sauce. The weird things you learn at a winery&#8230;<br />
We purchased two bottles of the Gewurtztraminer (as you might expect, we really liked it) and two small bottles of icewine (at 50ml apiece, there wasn&#8217;t much) &#8212; one was for Lisa and Miran.<br />
We stopped through Summerhill on the way back, eventually buying a small bag of chocolate-covered dried cherries. Very tasty.<br />
We spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing. This was, of course, a vacation &#8212; there was no need to work ourselves silly by trying to be too many places at once.<br />
Lisa called us at 6:30 to see if we were ready to go out. The first order of business was the mini-golf. Despite the fact that I quadruple-bogied a few holes, I still managed to beat the others &#8230; by a single stroke. In fact, there was a spread of only four strokes between all of us. (In short, we were all roughly the same calibre when it came to golf &#8230; although one of us was more apt to flinging balls into bushes.)<br />
Dinner was the hard part. We strolled right down the main strip without finding anything decent. We kept walking right until we were at the other end, checked out the Pentiction Resort, and finally settled on Mambo&#8217;s, the Italian eatery overlooking the lake.<br />
Dinner was supplemented by a large pitcher of sangria, but was (so I&#8217;m told) bland overall. My risoto wasn&#8217;t too bad, but the others&#8217; meals weren&#8217;t great. Dessert more than made up for it. While Lisa and Miran shared a tiramisu, Allison and I shared a meringue and vanilla ice cream platter with (real) whip cream and strawberries. Very tasty.<br />
We opted to skip the Relativity discussion that night, and made directly for bed. Getting home, I suddenly realised that Allison&#8217;s sunglass case was missing the sunglasses. Somehow, since the time Allison had given me her sunglasses (magnetic clip-ons for her regular glasses) at the mini-golf, I had managed to lose them.<br />
As you can imagine, I felt a bit like a heel that night&#8230;<br />
Mother Nature was annoyed &#8212; because we&#8217;d been moving around so much, she hadn&#8217;t been able to put clouds over us properly. She figured she&#8217;s do the job right on Sunday, though &#8212; she blanketed the entire province with clouds. And so our trip home would be a dark one.<br />
After quick checks of the mini-golf, Mambo&#8217;s, Penticon Resort, and all points in between for the missing sunglasses, I resolved to be less the cost of the replacements, and we headed towards home.<br />
Instead of the usual Coquihalla route, we tried taking Highway 3 (aka the Crow Foot trail, or some such name). After going up and down about a hundred times over the next few hours, we decided that all trips to the Okanagan would take place via the Coquihalla.<br />
Depression set back in once we reached Hope. The clouds were dark and oppressive, and the landscape looked its usual bleak green. After fighting our way through Lower Mainland morons, we pulled into home and rested from our weary trip.<br />
Ironically enough, today is full of the S-word I dare not speak, for fear of jinxing it again. With luck, it&#8217;ll hang on for a while longer&#8230;</p>

		<p>10 years.<br />
[[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Leaving Canada|I can&#8217;t believe it has been 10 years.]]<br />
On 30 June 1989, I departed for the first of what would become a string of interesting journeys into the unknown. This was my first trip out of North America, and my first trip as an Observer.<br />
I can&#8217;t help but be somewhat reflective upon the arrival of this date. 10 years, no matter who you are, is a long period of time. A lot of things can happen in 10 years &#8230; certainly that is true for me.<br />
Don&#8217;t worry &#8212; I&#8217;m not about to bombard you with a list of the things that have happened to me &#8212; that would be grounds for Amnesty International to boycott me for human rights violations.<br />
10 years ago, I left Canada as a naive teenager, ready to take on the world without fear, not really knowing what the outside world was like. I learned a few things on that trip, but what surprised me most were the things I learned about myself. 10 years later, I&#8217;m still surprising myself, each and every day.<br />
I suppose when I stop being surprised, I&#8217;ll stop living&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;ve seen many changes in myself, even over the past five years. Most of my friends and family have seen these changes. If you don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t changed, just remember what I was like when:<br />
a) I was in high school.<br />
b) You first met me.<br />
(For those of you who have met me within the past two years, you might not have really noticed much. So take my word for it. I&#8217;m certain those who have known me a while will back me up.)<br />
The next obvious question is: What&#8217;s in store for the next 10 years? Who knows&#8230; it could be anything. Always in motion, is the future. It&#8217;s hard to see, tough to grasp, nearly impossible to predict. That&#8217;s what I find interesting about it &#8212; the inability to classify it properly. It scares some people, frustrates others. For me, it&#8217;s another challenge to overcome.<br />
Today, the Observer is 10 years old, and is ready to enter his decade of development. With luck, the Observer will keep me young when I start getting old (particularly important, since my birthday comes up in a couple of weeks).<br />
Tomorrow, Allison and I are off to scare the inhabitants of the Okanagan. You&#8217;ll hear about it on Monday.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, I did something a little different than usual. I went to Calgary.<br />
Alone.<br />
Well, not totally alone. I went to visit Stuart, who I had only seen for a whopping six hours at Christmas. Ideally, I would have also visited Therese, but she was off in Halifax on a conference, and visiting her sister. Also visiting that weekend was Jay, one of Stuart&#8217;s friends from college, whom I had come to know quite well.<br />
It was becoming the &#8220;Boy&#8217;s Weekend&#8221;.<br />
The original intention behind all this was to get together to work on a script that Stuart and Jay had been working on extensively, that I had started to contribute to a few months ago. The weekend happened to coincide with the release of Star Wars: Episode 1. Lucky us.<br />
When I arrived at Gate C34 at the airport, I noticed that there was a significantly larger number of people than there should be for a a flight not due to board for 40 minutes, let alone depart for an hour. It turned out that the flight before mine (also going to Calgary) was late.<br />
Quickly deducing that my flight would be late arriving in Calgary, I decided to try playing my cards. I walked up to the desk and asked one of the two attendants if the flight leaving was full. When she told me it wasn&#8217;t, I asked if it was possible to change my flight from the 19:40 flight to the 18:30 flight (it ended up being the 19:00 by the time it actually got going).<br />
A few minutes later, I was seated next to a window, waiting to get moving.<br />
Luckily for me, timing was everything that evening. Jay arrived a couple of hours ahead of me, so he and Stuart had gone out for dinner. Arriving early, I attempted to call Stuart&#8217;s thinking he might be there. He wasn&#8217;t. My next task was to have him paged.<br />
A moment after the page went out, I saw Jay and Stuart walking across the baggage claim floor. The weekend had begun.<br />
We retreated to Stuart&#8217;s apartment and watched &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, after engaging in a debate about where John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) appears in the movie. We were unsuccessful in our search. (Apparently he&#8217;s a Rebel &#8212; I mistakenly thought he was an Imperial.)<br />
The following morning, we headed out into the partially cloudy and somewhat rainy Calgary. Following breakfast at Denny&#8217;s (which left Jay and I feeling a bit odd for most of the day), we traipsed about the downtown before finally ending up at Eau Claire Market, where we indulged ourselves on video games. We were killing time. We were seeing Star Wars that night, so we couldn&#8217;t really go anywhere without coming back late.<br />
After a very small lunch, a couple of beers, and an IMAX movie later, we headed out towards the south end of Calgary. You really get an idea of how big Calgary actually is when you find it takes almost an hour to get from downtown to the south end. (Of course, we were driving through rush hour traffic, so that&#8217;s to be somewhat expected.)<br />
We were not alone in our vigil &#8212; several of Stuart and Therese&#8217;s friends were also attending the affair.<br />
We lined up just before 8pm in anticipation of the 10:10pm show. And just so you&#8217;re aware, there were others in the line before us &#8212; we weren&#8217;t the most desperate.<br />
The atmosphere once we got into the theatre was like waiting for a concert to start. Lots of talking and laughing &#8230; even a beach ball that was flung around the room (at least until the management took it away; we booed the usher for ruining our fun).<br />
It was an odd feeling, watching a new Star Wars movie. I couldn&#8217;t honestly tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen the original trilogy. We&#8217;ll just leave at &#8220;a lot&#8221;. We actually had to read the introductory text as it scrolled by. Our excitement was uncontrolled because, as Stuart put it, we didn&#8217;t know exactly what was going to happen in the next moment.<br />
A little over two hours later, we emerged from the theatre, mostly wired from some of the things we had seen. It was a good introduction to a long story (something that a lot of people were forgetting), with a lot of great action. We dreamed of many a lightsabre duel that night&#8230;<br />
The following morning, we decided we would head into the mountains. Jay had never been to the mountains, and wanted to see them up close. The weather was good, so we opted to take the day amongst the snowy caps of the Rockies.<br />
Before leaving Calgary, we picked up a friend of Jay&#8217;s who had moved to Calgary a year earlier, Kevin. Stuart knew Kevin through Jay, so I became the odd person out. Luckily, Kevin and I got along well, so it was a briefly-felt feeling.<br />
Following a quick lunch at Pete&#8217;s Drive-In, we hauled the hour and a half into the mountains. Jay (who had bought a camera that morning so he could take pictures) almost sounded like a little kid as he clicked away with his camera, recording the imagery for posterity.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Banff, although we were going first to Lake Lorna. Kevin quickly asked if any of us have been to Morraine Lake, to which the three of us all replied &#8220;no&#8221;. A third destination was added to the list.<br />
As we drove along, we discussed a great many things, including the things we would do once we finally got to Banff. We even discussed the pronounciation of Banff. Technically, it is &#8220;banff&#8221;. It quickly degraded to &#8220;bamf&#8221;. One of us saying &#8220;banff&#8221; or &#8220;bamf&#8221; was followed by three &#8220;bamf&#8221;s.<br />
Guys do weird things. Accept it.<br />
On the way to Morraine Lake, we noticed something. Snow. Yeah, I know, that sounds really dumb. But there was a lot more snow up there than we expected. This led to, of course, a snowball fight.<br />
It was short-lived (snowballs are really cold on unprotected hands).<br />
For those of you who don&#8217;t remember Morraine Lake (and yes, all you Canadians have seen it before), find an old CDN$20 bill. Flip it over. Voila! Morraine Lake. Didn&#8217;t even know it was that close to Lake Louise.<br />
The snow there was pretty deep, almost burying the sign that describes the significance of the area. Luckily, a lot of people had been there before us, so we could walk across the snow without falling in. This was a good thing for me, because in all my haste to pack for Calgary, I forgot to bring shoes. All I had were my sandals.<br />
Of course, this didn&#8217;t stop me from doing dumb things, like climbing the rock pile at the head of the lake with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. (Luckily, I have good sandals that grip almost anything, and the rocks were bare.)<br />
I was strange seeing Lake Louise again. The last time was a year and a half ago, when Gerry and I had stopped off on our way to Vancouver. Snow covered most of the mountains around the lake, and the lake itself still bore a sheet of ice. I felt sorry for Jay, not being able to witness the greeny-blue lake for himself.<br />
We wandered about the Chateau for a while, debated on crashing a wedding (again, it&#8217;s a guy thing; but don&#8217;t worry, we wouldn&#8217;t actually do such a thing &#8230; without good reason, that is), and eventually left for Banff (bamf).<br />
The townsite of Banff (bamf) hadn&#8217;t changed much in the year since I last visited (with Allison). After Stuart pulled into a well-hidden free parking spot (something that I wish I&#8217;d seen before), we proceeded to invade the downtown.<br />
It seems that Banff (bamf) was also invaded by a squadron of Air Cadets &#8212; they were everywhere. On every corner, and usually scattered about the middle of each block. It almost seemed Dickensian; I expected to see a military Fagin lurking around the corners.<br />
We wandered up Banff (bamf) Ave. towards the Park Administration building, then came down the other side. We stopped into various shops, but I abstained from buying anything &#8212; nothing there that really interested me. Jay and Kevin got sucked into a fudge shop where they indulged their sweet teeth. Tasty stuff, but it made my incisors vibrate.<br />
Finally, it was time for dinner (we really hadn&#8217;t eaten yet), so we headed towards St. James Gate, an Irish pub that Stuart recommended. As we headed over, we realised that we weren&#8217;t too far from Banff&#8217;s (bamf) movie theatre.<br />
It was playing Star Wars.<br />
They still had tickets.<br />
We figured popcorn would tie us over until we could get something else later.<br />
Emerging two hours later, hopped up on a heap of adrenaline from the lightsabre duels (yeah, we focused on that a lot), we went to dinner. A nice lamb stew and an Irish ale really hit the spot.<br />
After dinner, we ended up having to make a hard decision. Banff (bamf) is a great place to have fun. We thought we might stay the night, grab a hotel, and drive back in the morning. But then the little party-pooper in me thought about the plans for the next day &#8212; Drumheller. Driving from Banff (bamf) to Calgary and then to Drumheller wasn&#8217;t exactly something I wanted to do. It seemed it wasn&#8217;t something Stuart or Jay wanted to do either.<br />
The next time we&#8217;re in Banff (bamf), we&#8217;re spending the night, even if it means eight people crammed into a room.<br />
We arrived in Calgary an hour later, initially at a loss for something to do. We ended up downtown at a pub called &#8220;The Barley Mill&#8221;, where we swapped jokes, movie quotes, and work-related annoyances, quaffed a couple pints, and listened to some really great jazz.<br />
We got up a bit later the next morning, showered, hit Safeway to get hot dogs and buns, and headed out to Drumheller. I hadn&#8217;t been to Drumheller before, and really wanted to know what that area of Alberta was like. Jay hadn&#8217;t been there before either (he hadn&#8217;t been to Alberta before), and was excited about the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.<br />
It was a long drive. At least, it felt like a long drive. In reality, it probably wasn&#8217;t anything overly lengthy, but the heat and lack of features (it is the Prairies, after all) made it seem longer. Finally, the flatness gave way to an almost Grand Canyon-like valley (albeit significantly shallower), and the city of Drumheller.<br />
Drumheller is one of these strange cities that base their entire existence on one thing. Usually, that one thing is a resource (i.e. a mine). In this case, it&#8217;s dinosaurs. I&#8217;m really curious to know what would happen to Drumheller if the Tyrell had been built somewhere else.<br />
Our first stop was at McMullen Island, a small park where we had lunch. Then it was off to stare at Mr. T-Rex.<br />
I&#8217;ve been to a few museums now in Alberta, and I will say that they have some of the best ones I&#8217;ve ever been to. It&#8217;s really quite impressive. It&#8217;s not just a few piles of bones for you to stare at &#8212; they purposely lead you through exhibits leading to the rise of the dinosaur. Finally, by the time you reach the actual exhibits, you understand why the dinosaurs came to be.<br />
The museum works of the theory of evolution. You start with the single-celled organisms, progressing to the primitive ocean life. Then it&#8217;s on to the first plants on land, followed by the first land creatures. You start seeing the proto-dinosaurs, finally landing in a large room full of T-Rexes, triceratops, and Albertosauri.<br />
But the exhibits do not stop there &#8212; they continue on the evolution through the extinction of the dinosaur and rise of the mammal. They show you the birth of the sabre-toothed cats, the mammoths, and then take you to the ultimate mammal exhibit &#8230; the gift shop. Think about it &#8212; where else can you see the ultimate mammal in their natural environment?<br />
Returning to the outside, we wandered about the trails near the museum, looking at the rock strata that form the valley the museum sits in, the strata that contains the bones of dinosaurs appearing in the museum. Before hitting the trails, though, we endulged on some frozen treats to try and counteract the 30-someodd degree heat.<br />
A few times, as we walked about the rolling hills, we could hear good ol&#8217; Prairie Silence. For those of you who haven&#8217;t visited the Prairies and parked yourself in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the machines that make the noise we hear every day of our lives, you&#8217;ll never really know what it was like 100 years ago. The silence is truly deafening. (For reference, the only place I&#8217;ve ever been that was quieter was 150 feet below ground in a cave.)<br />
A short drive east from Drumheller took us to the Hoodoos. These are short clumps of rocks that have crowns. The crowns are make from less-soluable rock; they remain mostly untouched while the rocks beneath erode away. It makes for an interesting sight.<br />
Stuart, Jay, and I (mostly Jay and I) hiked to the top of the hill to see what we could see. There&#8217;s a lot out there.<br />
Another thing there was a lot of was sun &#8212; and I got a lot of it. Luckily, not so much to get a sun burn, but enough that my skin felt warm to the touch (even in the shade), and I really wished I had brought sun screen.<br />
Coming down the hill was a little harder than going up. Trying not to lose one&#8217;s footing when wearing sandals is a bit of a challenge, especially when the ground is crumbly. I slid a short distance down the slope, but quickly regained by footing.<br />
We stopped briefly at the Rosedale Suspension Bridge, put in place by the Star Mine company. The mines closed down in the 50&#8217;s, but the bridge continues to draw tourists. Rebuilt a few times since it&#8217;s original installation, the Suspension Bridge now features sturdy wooden towers and a steel grate floor.<br />
After stopping briefly to obtain liquid refreshment (we were quite thirsty by that point), we headed back towards Calgary. The drive back was surprisingly faster than the drive out, despite the fact that we ended up at the south end of the city, and had to travel for about 10 minutes along the Trans Canada to get back in.<br />
Stuart drove through the north of Calgary on our way back to his apartment, allowing me to see what the outskirts of the city look like. I cannot understand why anyone would want to live that far out. You might as well be living in High River for Airdale for all it really matters.<br />
We rented a movie (Rocketman &#8230; a surprisingly funny movie) and ordered Chinese. After the movie ended, we went out for a walk to a local sports bar, where we dove back into the movie script again.<br />
On the following morning, we headed out in search of Darth Maul action figures. Unfortunately, a few million people got there ahead of us. Both Toys &#8216;R Us and the Zellers we checked (not to mention the Bay) had their stocks depleted. Not a total surprise&#8230;<br />
Stuart took us downtown to his office, to show off his little piece of the advertising world. His company (Parallel) does some pretty amazing stuff &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s office is plastered with a lot of that amazing work. There are people whose abilities impress me &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s talent just plain frightens me.<br />
I remember his work when I was in high school. When I look back on his cartoony past and then look at the work he produces now, I admittedly get envious. He&#8217;s done very well on his skill, and it&#8217;s brought him many good things.<br />
We drove around Calgary for a little while, fairly aimlessly (we weren&#8217;t in any rush to go anywhere). We drove by Big Rock Brewery, for whom Stuart had done quite a bit of work. (Those of you in the Calgary area might see the billboards for &#8220;Kold&#8221; or the new Big Rock Brewery trucks with the beer bottles on the side &#8230; that&#8217;s Stuart&#8217;s handiwork.)<br />
At least some people get to see their work on public display. (For the record, Jay&#8217;s working on a kid&#8217;s cartoon show. He&#8217;ll get to see his work on TV.)<br />
As we began to drift in the direction of the airport, a sudden pang of guilt began to wash over me. In the hectic flow of the weekend, I had neglected to contact my relatives. As we were in the north-east anyway, I asked if we could quickly pop by my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home.<br />
I had been there twice before. I knew roughly where it was. But where I couldn&#8217;t remember the exact road to take us into their subdivision, Stuart did. He&#8217;d been there once.<br />
Stuart&#8217;s got a good road memory. (It also helps that he lives in the same city, and IKEA&#8217;s in the same area.)<br />
I got lucky, catching them after they had arrived home from camping. From Drumheller. The previous day. It&#8217;s truly a wonder that we didn&#8217;t run into each other over the course of the day.<br />
We talked for a while, while Jay put Maggie (my aunt and uncle&#8217;s dalmatian) into total submission. Jay&#8217;s got a way with dogs. Jennifer (my cousin) came tearing through the room at one point. She was about a foot taller than the last time I&#8217;d seen her, with shorter hair, and new braces. She smiled, said &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then tore back out of the room.<br />
<em>Sigh.</em> I remember being that age.<br />
Before long, we had to leave, and headed to the airport. Jay&#8217;s flight was before mine, and we didn&#8217;t want him to miss it. My flight wasn&#8217;t for an hour after his, so I would have time to kill.<br />
We bade Jay farewell as he disappeared behind the security wall and eventually onto Toronto. Stuart and I turned to dinner at the Harvey&#8217;s, before it was my turn to depart.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to friends, especially those that mean a lot in your life.<br />
Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see more of my friends this summer. Exactly when I&#8217;ll see them is a completely different issue. But with luck, it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

		<p>Our long weekend started Thursday night, when Allison&#8217;s company decided to hold an employee appreciation event at Metropolis (an entertainment-centric mall a couple of blocks from our apartment). Interlogic was springing for two hours of video games at Sega Playdium, and then dinner at the Rainforest Cafe.<br />
We didn&#8217;t find out about these plans until Wednesday night, so I was unable to make the video games (already having made plans to the &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; with some of my co-workers). However, I made an effort to drop by for dinner.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d met Allison&#8217;s new co-workers, and most of them seemed very nice. Claire, in particular, was extremely cordial &#8212; but since she&#8217;s the HR manager, I guess that&#8217;s to be expected.<br />
When we returned home, we made our final decision to go to Victoria for the weekend. We had tentative plans for some time, but we based our final decision to go on the fact that Allison&#8217;s grandmother was in the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria. Her grandmother had been the focal point of the Collins/Vailmont Easter for about 30 years, and it just seemed wrong not to come over and cheer her up.<br />
(As you may recall, we were in Nanaimo last Easter, engaged in Easter egg hunts in the grandparent&#8217;s yard. This would be the first year in about three decades where the hunt would not happen.)<br />
Early Friday morning, we hauled ourselves out of bed, and hit the road to Tsawwassen. Because of the Easter weekend, BC Ferries were running trips every hour, instead of every two hours, which was the norm. This was good for us, since we didn&#8217;t need to worry about missing a sailing &#8230; which we did.<br />
Arriving about ten minutes too late to make the 10:00 sailing, we parked the car and opted for a late breakfast &#8212; pizza. But this was no ordinary pizza, it was *breakfast* pizza: Eggs, onions, ham, green peppers, cheese, but no tomato sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, and fairly expensive. If they made announcements, it would go something like this:<br />
&#8220;Your attention, please. BC Ferries is happy to charge you exceedingly high prices for low-quality food that you will buy because you are hungry from trying to get here on time not to miss a sailing, or your children are begging you into submission&#8230;&#8221;<br />
We made the 11:00 sailing with no trouble.<br />
We sailed across on the Spirit of British Columbia, the largest short-distance ferry in the fleet (another larger ferry carts passengers up the coast, which is an overnight trip). It&#8217;s a massive vessel, about the size of a small cruise ship. It makes the trip fairly enjoyable &#8230; at least if you don&#8217;t suffer from motion sickness.<br />
Procuring a seat in the corner of the cafeteria, I ran cover by buying some snack food while Allison worked. BC Ferries doesn&#8217;t take kindly to people sucking up table space, so I made an effort to make them think we were eating &#8230; just really really slowly.<br />
Arriving in Victoria, we found it was raining. We had hoped that the weather would be nice for a change, but the generally poor weather was following us around. And no, before you think it, one does not get used to continually bad weather; one gets increasingly irritable.<br />
After a short drive into Victoria, we headed over to the Royal Jubilee Hospital to check in with the family elders. After parking, we wandered inside, and attempted to find Allison&#8217;s parents. We knew they were there &#8212; Allison&#8217;s Aunt Robin drives a very recognisable car.<br />
Luckily for us, we ran into Robin on the second floor, while attempting to find the washroom. Allison&#8217;s grandmother was pleased to see us, as were her parents. We visited briefly as a pair, then ducked into the TV room.<br />
We stayed at the hospital until around 6:00 or so, at which time we headed over to Robin&#8217;s apartment for dinner.<br />
We slept on the floor that night, a probably-not-so-great idea. I woke with a stiffness bordering on rigor mortis, Allison not better off. But we grinned and bore it, and had a leisurely breakfast with Robin, Allison&#8217;s parents, and her grandfather.<br />
The morning was significantly brighter than the previous day, the sun having actually shone through for a change. After a quick visit to the hospital, we opted for a tour of Victoria. Okay, maybe not *really* a tour &#8212; we had been there before, after all &#8212; but it was a good excuse to go out.<br />
We drove downtown, parking on a side street near the Eaton Centre. We had only an hour (the parking meter went no further) to wander about. So we wandered &#8230; right into Roger&#8217;s Chocolates.<br />
Roger&#8217;s is a mainstay in parts of BC &#8212; it&#8217;s an old company, specialising in some very tasty treats. It&#8217;s like Laura Secord back east &#8230; only better. Our mission was to obtain Easter chocolates for the family &#8212; this was not going to be a typical Easter, so we thought it better that we make an effort to do something special.<br />
After our romp through the chocolate shop, we walked around the harbour area, wandering into The Empress hotel. We checked out the prices of the lunch menus, suffered sticker shock, and proceeded back outside again.<br />
After moving the car to a less time-dependent location (a very cheap parking garage), we hopped out to find some lunch. We headed into an Indian restaurant, and promptly started inquring about the soup of the day. That&#8217;s when we found out that there was no lunch special on weekends, which meant the prices more than doubled. We made a hasty exit and went into another Indian restaurant two doors down.<br />
Being a beautiful day, we spent a fair bit of time wandering along the walkway around the inner harbour. You could hear the mainstay bagpiper from across the harbour with no difficulty.<br />
Walking around towards the parliment buildings, we passed a congregation of people, surrounding a small brass band, and a boat covered with flowers. Our first impression was that someone was being married. It wasn&#8217;t until a while later that it occurred to us that it was actually a memorial service.<br />
The walkways were packed with people, all relishing in the bright sunshine. (It was so bright that I nearly got a sunburn!) But the temperature was still cool, so only the brave (or the stupid) wore shorts. And yes, I did have a pair with me &#8212; it was still too cool for my liking.<br />
Buskers were about, too. We saw one busker whose act we remembered from the year before. There were a few differences, which made the overall show pretty good, certainly worth the two dollars Allison gave the busker.<br />
On the way back to the car, we checked for the availability of a hotel &#8212; we weren&#8217;t too keen on staying on the floor for a second night. We found one hotel room left for $30, and promptly headed off before we lost it.<br />
The Friendship Inn has been in Victoria since the dawn of time, or sometime roughly near it. The buildings are old, the rooms musty, and the mattresses somewhat curved. But for $30, I wasn&#8217;t about to complain any. Well, maybe except for the people &#8220;living&#8221; next door. We didn&#8217;t leave our things, opting to bring them back with us.<br />
If you go just west of Victoria, you&#8217;ll run into Esquimalt. Dependng on who you ask, Esquimalt is either a scary, run-down, naval base-influenced town; or it&#8217;s a fairly nice little suburb. I personally vote for the latter. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; there are some seedy areas (but then, even Oakville has its seedy areas).<br />
We drove about, looking at the houses, even looking into an open house out of curiousity, just to see what was about. We drove up and down, back and forth, eventually finding ourselves back in Victoria again.<br />
So we drove up and down, back and forth, until we found ourselves driving along Dallas Road, heading into Oak Bay. We had driven along this route before the previous year, only it was Allison driving, and it was at night. It pretty much ended the same way, with us passing along the north side of UVic trying to find our way back into Victoria.<br />
We returned to the hospital towards dinnertime, to check on everyone milling around Allison&#8217;s grandmother. We were surprised to find Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister) in attendence, and we had to do a double take when we saw Brenna and Cameron (Allison&#8217;s cousins, who live in Parksville). They were on their way back to Nanaimo (and Parksville). We nearly passed each other in the hall.<br />
Dinner was at Robin&#8217;s again, only instead of the home-cooked meal we ate the night before, we had Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
As a child, I remember loving Kentucky Fried Chicken. Of course, as a child, I could eat whatever I wanted without any consequences. As an adult, I am convinced that KFC is evidence of Satan&#8217;s existence. Allison and I both regretted dinner&#8230;<br />
On the way back to our hotel that night, I noticed something a little strange &#8212; the car seemed to be a bit louder. In fact, it vibrated a bit more, too. In the back of my mind, I knew what the problem was. In the front of my mind, I was denying it with every ounce of my strength.<br />
The next morning, the truth finally decided it would not be contained. On the way out to have something to eat, the muffler broke loose. Well, partially loose &#8212; there was a large rubber bracket holding the muffer to the car. As Allison&#8217;s mother would point out later, every time my car and the island have anything to do with one another, I have problems with the car.<br />
Pulling off to the side, I whipped out my trusty bungee cord, and lashed the stupid muffler to the underside of the car. Ideally, I would&#8217;ve just taken the muffler off, but that rubber connector just taunted me.<br />
We headed back to Vancouver in early afternoon, realising that if we hurried, we could get to Granville Island before it closed. (It was this revelation that made Allison convinced that she couldn&#8217;t live anywhere outside of Vancouver &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t get to the Market whenever she wanted.)<br />
A good weekend. It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had a good weekend. I mean a weekend where we didn&#8217;t have to worry about being rained on. Believe me &#8212; that&#8217;s a long time.<br />
After a leisurely rising Saturday morning, I went out to get my muffler fixed. That was my first mistake &#8212; I found out that the entire exhaust system was about two minutes from giving out. $200 later, I was out getting my car washed. That was my second mistake &#8212; Allison wanted me home earlier than that to clean. As soon as I got in, we were running back out again.<br />
We were going to spend the afternoon at Granville Island (yes, we go there a lot) looking around the market and buying food for dinner. It was a good way to spend the afternoon.<br />
Sunday started off even more beautifully than Saturday. It was warm (we opened all the windows for the first time this year) and sunny &#8212; the day was just waiting to be enjoyed. So we spent an hour cleaning. Don&#8217;t laugh &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how good that made us feel.<br />
As we were working, Allison heard a news story on the TV, talking about how the Alberta Report (a group of ultra right-wing wackos from Alberta &#8212; although there are those who think that *anyone* from Alberta is an ultra right-wing wacko) was going to take their message to Toronto, which the Report viewed as where most of the evils in Canada came from.<br />
It was then that it suddenly hit me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t view Toronto (or Oakville, for that matter) as home. In fact, it seemed somewhat foreign to me. It was no longer a place that was comforting, familiar &#8212; it was very distant, cold, disparate from everything I could think of.<br />
It was with a great and sudden shock that I realised that I have become a BCer: I complain about the rain and the cold (despite the fact that it&#8217;s not that cold), I wear sandals as often as possible (I&#8217;m wearing them right now), I can&#8217;t stand the NDP government (but will probably vote for them because all the alternatives are far worse), and view the east as an entirely different place. Canada is certainly different when you&#8217;re not in the centre of the universe anymore&#8230;<br />
At any rate, after our quick spring clean, we jumped in the car, and ran out to enjoy the day. We ended the day with a quick pasta dish, which for some unknown reason, made the whole weekend complete.</p>
