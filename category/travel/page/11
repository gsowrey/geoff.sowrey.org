Day 7<br />
Friday the 13th has never been good for me. Some say it&#8217;s just superstition. Experience tells me otherwise.<br />
Today started at 03:00. For most cities, it&#8217;s an unruly hour. For Saskatoon, it&#8217;s downright ungodly. Nothing happens in Saskatoon at three in the morning. Except, of course, us preparing for an eastern broadcast. Julie and I whisked our way down to the VIA Rail station for a live broadcast with Colleen Jones. Luckily, we sort of knew where we were going. Aside from almost missing the turn off for the main road south, the rest was easy to find, even in the dark. (You can&#8217;t miss the grain elevator down there.)<br />
While I would love to say that I got to be on TV with Colleen, that&#8217;s not the truth. Colleen is a one-woman show, and is perfectly suited for the job. You want impressive? Try reading off the weather forecast for the entire country while having it read to you through an earpiece and make it sound natural. I have a hard enough time relaying messages over the phone to people who don&#8217;t care what it sounds like.<br />
So why was I there? Colleen wanted to review the New Media kiosks. This is my little jurisdiction. Paranoia, and a far-too-good in-depth knowledge of how computers behave told me that I needed to be there. Originally, I offered my services. Then I insisted that I be there. I&#8217;d rather lose a couple hours of sleep for sanity of mind.<br />
I&#8217;ve never seen a television broadcast before, certainly not a live broadcast. It&#8217;s quite an experience to see how this is all handled with a camera operator, another person whose role I never really figured out, and Colleen. Julie and I were there for answering questions (off-camera, when Colleen wasn&#8217;t live on the air) and covering the technical issues. (During a couple of breaks, I whipped in for a few pointers.)<br />
By 05:30, the show was done and we were on our way back to the hotel. My intention was to sleep a little while, do some work, and then prepare for our event. Instead, I rolled around for an hour, and ended up groggy for the whole day. In addition to that, I lost my cellular phone, my gloves, forgot to tell Stefani when our shuttle was leaving, and probably said a few things I didn&#8217;t mean to say because I was too tired to think straight.<br />
In short, Friday the 13th was continuing its historical trend.<br />
About the only thing that&#8217;s gone right so far is the journals. After wrestling a position on the hotel&#8217;s &#8220;office&#8221; computer (we&#8217;re without wireless access again), I managed to email my files to Toronto for posting on the website. Brenda&#8217;s decided to streamline the process a wee bit. Due to connectivity problems, we simply can&#8217;t do the &#8220;every day&#8221; posting we&#8217;d wanted to do. So instead of me sending templates, I&#8217;ll just send text and pictures, and let Elizabeth and Terri sort out the details. And that&#8217;s just fine with me.<br />
When we arrived at the VIA Rail station, my booth was most set up. All we needed to do was erect an extra table for the paper ShowVote ballots and prepare a few configurations on the computers. We had ample time, and didn&#8217;t rush our last part of the set up.<br />
The wind outside was terrific. All the tents were staked down. Dust was constantly in the wind (Bill S. wrote in his journal: &#8220;&#8216;Saskatoon&#8217; is Indian for &#8216;shit gets in your eye'&#8221;.) Many of the stand-ups had to retreat to the baggage car, or at least be tied to the tent poles so they wouldn&#8217;t blow away.<br />
As usual, people were arriving long before we were done. This seemed to be a trend I doubt we&#8217;ll ever get away from. But it didn&#8217;t matter to those who came early. They seemed quite happy to wait for things to start happening. I love the patience of the prairies.<br />
Our previous events had primarily been our show, with the odd bit of content thrown in by the regional organizers. In Saskatoon, we were now dealing with Radio-Canada (the French version of CBC), who not only occupied a significant amount of space, but also ran much of the live radio broadcasting. We seemed to have our first true CBC celebration &#8212; not just the train.<br />
Guests arrived in a fairly regular flow. We weren&#8217;t hit with the surges we&#8217;ve received in previous stops. Our regional organizers were quite good in setting up other activities &#8212; like face-painting &#8212; that not only evened out the flow, but probably attracted people to stay in the station building, where the Boutique and New Media were located.<br />
The face painters were amazing. I&#8217;ve never seen face painting like that outside of a couple Cirque du Soliel shows I&#8217;ve seen. It was an assembly line, where one person laid down the foundation, and another person marked the details. I think they had three lines going all at once. It got to the point where nearly everyone &#8212; including CJ and several of our volunteers &#8212; had painted faces. What really impressed me was finding out that they were all former street kids, who had been hired by the company, taught to do their trade, and are hugely successful. At one point, Julie even muttered something about wanting to have taken them on the entire trip, had she known about them.<br />
The day skipped by quite quickly. Well, for me, anyway. I crawled into my bunk on the train and snoozed for a couple of hours, lest I pass out at the kiosks. (Not that it really helped much.) Despite this being our longest event to date, we arrived at the hour of 19:00 far faster than I had thought.<br />
In all our previous attempts at packing, our best time had been around three hours. This was not only unsuitable for some of our needs, it would mean missing one or more of our departure times. But for the fist time, our striking and packing of the baggage car took less than two hours. It was reason to celebrate.<br />
Neil, Julie, Analisa, and I tried to celebrate (after returning to the hotel) by finding either the VIA crew, or the rest of our CBC crew. This brought us to Overdrive, a bar a few blocks north of our hotel. We arrived at the front door, all donning some sort of CBC outerwear. When they tried to ding us for a cover charge, Analisa went to work&#8230;<br />
Doorman: Two bucks.<br />
Analisa: We&#8217;re with the CBC. How about just letting us in?<br />
Doorman: What&#8217;s the CBC? [Yes, he actually said that.]<br />
Analisa: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation?<br />
Doorman: [Blank stare.]<br />
Analisa: CBC TV?<br />
Doorman: [Blank stare.]<br />
Analisa: Hockey Night in Canada??<br />
Doorman: Oh, you guys do that? Okay, yeah, you can go in.<br />
I think if you looked closely enough, you could have seen Analisa doing the Jedi mind trick.<br />
Once we bypassed the cover charge, we came to realize that we were all too old. This took about 20 seconds. The music was earbleedingly loud (and nauseatingly bad), the oldest person looked about 10 years younger than me (and I&#8217;m the youngest of the four of us), and we couldn&#8217;t find a single VIA or CBC person there. We felt like narcs wandering around &#8230; &#8216;course all the stares we were getting didn&#8217;t help much. We wisely abandoned the place and headed back towards the hotel. That&#8217;s when we found Fred, and we headed to our venue of the evening.Jax used to be a warehouse. In the years since storage, it&#8217;s probably been many things. The second floor is now Jax, a rather strange little nightclub. Strange because it&#8217;s gaudy. I think that&#8217;s also it&#8217;s appeal &#8212; people go to Jax to avoid the brain-vibrating noise of other clubs. Most of the walls are painted in near-atrocious colours, purely for the fact that at about 23:00, the black lights come on, and everything lights up. There&#8217;s nothing like a neon nightclub to set things right.<br />
By 01:00, everyone who had left the hotel (which was almost our entire crew, including VIA on-train staff) were at Jax. Most had taken to the dance floor for their song of choice. (Neil requested &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221; before hunting down the Technical Crew at another venue not far away.) To say the music mix was eclectic is to say Frank Zappa was a little off-kilter. Destiny Child&#8217;s &#8220;Bootylicious&#8221; followed by Ozzy Ozbourne&#8217;s &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221; only to be upstaged by Eminem&#8217;s &#8220;Without Me&#8221; certainly does make the mind wonder.<br />
I ended up leaving early. I have a slightly distorted sense of duty, mostly because I have to get these entries back to Toronto for publishing on the website. And hey, for 15 minutes of fame, I certainly will go that extra mile. It&#8217;ll probably be my only chance.</p>

Day 6<br />
Most Canadians have heard of Biggar, Saskatchewan. Well maybe they haven&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m sure they know someone from Biggar. It&#8217;s the home of Olympic gold medal curler, Sandra Schmirler. While I doubt that&#8217;s what brought us to the small town of barely 2,500, we more than happy to have visited.<br />
Colleen Jones joined us this morning to do her broadcast. Because her broadcast is featured from 06:00 to 08:00 Eastern time, many of us were up at 03:30 Biggar time to set up stairs and access to the museum, turn lights on, and be available in case something is needed. Luckily, I was not up this morning. We&#8217;ll be pulling early mornings for the next couple of days (my turn will likely be tomorrow).<br />
Although we were to start at 09:00, people started arriving at 06:30. We started early. I guess there&#8217;s not much to do in Biggar, and something like this attracts a lot of attention. By the time I woke up, at least 30 people had already toured the museum. We were such a large attraction that entire classes of children appeared in small school buses to view the exhibits. I wished we could have done a full event.<br />
The kids knew we were coming to Biggar. They&#8217;d seen the information on CBC&#8217;s website and made plans for it. The interesting thing is &#8212; the town of Biggar didn&#8217;t know until not long before we arrived. Had the town known, so they told us, we would have waked that morning to a home-style pancake breakfast. While we loved the VIA food, there&#8217;s something to be said for pancakes. We turned like ravenous wolves on the management to make sure that succeeding towns knew we were coming.<br />
But the major and the town council still showed up. I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;d found out we&#8217;d be there through &#8220;official&#8221; channels, or if they&#8217;d been asked to come down for Colleen&#8217;s broadcast. All I do know is that the mayor gave each of us pins and keychains bearing the town&#8217;s slogan: &#8220;New York is big, but this is Biggar&#8221;.<br />
The town&#8217;s slogan is actually the result of a joke. An American survey crew visiting the town in 1909, after spending a little too much time in a tavern, wrote it on a sign. But instead of being offended, the townspeople rather liked the idea, and adopted it as their own.<br />
Frank Leahy and Friends were in their element here. In most places, they have people who like the music, tap their feet, and listen. Here, the people participated. Frank even dressed up in a light blue plaid shirt and jeans for the occasion. Kids visiting from one of the schools even got the band to play the theme to &#8220;Hockey Night In Canada&#8221;. Definitely a different tune when played with a fiddle.<br />
Due to the lack of activity at the train, I took the opportunity to find the Sandra Schmirler park. Asking a woman whom I thought was native to the area, I not only engaged myself in riveting conversation but also found someone to drive me to the park. It turned out that the woman and her husband were not from Biggar &#8212; they had driven over an hour from North Battleford just to see the train. (But they weren&#8217;t the long-distance champions. Some people came over six hours to see us.)<br />
The Sandra Schmirler Olympic Gold Medal park is subdued. Somehow, I doubt Biggar nor Sandra&#8217;s family would have allowed it to be any other way. It&#8217;s a children&#8217;s playground. Biggar wanted a nice, safe playground that everyone could enjoy. It&#8217;s large. I wish I had a playground like that growing up. The park will serve many generations of Biggarites (Biggarians?) to come.<br />
Biggar has got to be the most friendly place I&#8217;ve ever been. Everyone is happy to see you. And if you look like you&#8217;re lost, people will not only direct you, but offer to drive you to where you want to go without you having to ask. It&#8217;s difficult to say &#8220;no&#8221;. Walking back to the train was difficult. Not because it was far, but because I had to politely refuse rides from nearly every car that passed. Biggar&#8217;s hospitality is near-legendary, and for good reason. The walk back also gave me a chance to see small town Canada more closely. Living in places such as Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Calgary, I rarely get to see what rural Canada is truly like.<br />
I walked down Main Street (missing the Biggar Museum, only because I didn&#8217;t know about it), taking in the glory of Biggar. Think I&#8217;m joking? Then you&#8217;ve never been to a small prairie town. There&#8217;s a calm, relaxing air about this sort of a town. You feel calm, and completely safe. These people probably don&#8217;t even have locks on their doors. They don&#8217;t know the troubles or the pressures of the big cities. That kind of peace is hard to find.<br />
At the foot of Main Street is the railway station, originally built by the Grand Trunk Northern Railway in the early 1900s. It became a CN station when Grand Trunk was taken over, and used until CN abandoned its passenger service and VIA took over. CN closed the station, forcing VIA to a small &#8220;hut&#8221; next door, which served barely more for a ticket office and waiting room. In 1995, the VIA station was closed. VIA no longer serves Biggar. It was apparently quite a fight to get the train to stop there.<br />
I found Angela and Tracy standing on the road in front of the station, holding one of our CBC signs. Apparently, we originally were to stop at the station, but due to logistics, ended up on the south side of the yard, next to a fertilizer plant. Tracy and Angela were directing traffic to the south side. But only Tracy was wearing her black CBC crew shirt &#8212; Angela was sporting the newest fashion craze: a T-shirt emblazoned with the Biggar town logo. The woman parked next to them told me I could find her back at the train, which was where I left my wallet.<br />
While taking photographs of the old Grand Trunk Northern railway station (I love the look of old railway stations), I ran into my friends from North Battleford. Again, they offered me the chance to ride back to the train. Our train was on the opposite side of a very large rail yard, which I could only cross about a kilometre away. This time, I accepted. It was either that, or risk crossing the tracks. And it&#8217;s a big yard.<br />
Biggar is a major divisional point on the Canadian National Railway. It used to be much larger, featuring a large roundhouse, car shop, and bunkhouse. Today, it&#8217;s a crew change location &#8212; CN maintains a newer modern bunkhouse on the north side of the yard. The roundhouse still stands, but today houses a turkey farm that processes 100,000 birds every year. (Luckily for us, it was empty for our arrival. We were told the smell is something to behold. The mayor had been extremely annoyed when he found out we were being sided downwind from the farm.)<br />
When I returned to the train, the T-shirts were on sale. They featured two designs: the town logo, and a cartoon of New York with the caption &#8220;Big&#8221; next to a cartoon of the town with the caption &#8220;Biggar&#8221;. The daughter of one of the curators had made the design while a starving artist in New York. We bought most of her supply.<br />
Eleven o&#8217;clock arrived too quickly, and time to pack up again. We wanted to stay around longer &#8212; Biggar was such a nice place, and we were certain we could entertain the entire town. But schedules must be kept on a railway. It was off to Saskatoon.<br />
The VIA station in Saskatoon is in the south end of the city. On one side are a few houses (mostly industrial space), the other farmland. But the platform is large, and the station building available. Although we had no show in Saskatoon today, we did get an early start for tomorrow. It&#8217;s a seven hour show we&#8217;re putting on, and the less time we spend setting up, the more energy we&#8217;ll have.<br />
Colleen wants to broadcast from the train again tomorrow, and wants to showcase the New Media set up. That meant we had to do a complete set-up so we&#8217;d be ready for tomorrow morning. Or rather, so Colleen would be ready. And I need to be there. I wasn&#8217;t really asked to be there, at least not directly. Funny thing about responsibility, though &#8212; it&#8217;ll get you out of bed at really early hours of the morning. I might not be a full employee of the CBC, but I want New Media to look good.<br />
By 17:00, we had set up what we could and cleared out for our hotel. Showered and feeling better, several of us headed down the road to a railroad-themed restaurant, where we indulged in good dinner and great conversation. We started off strong, but towards the end we were beginning to drop like flies. Neil was the first to exit, nearly falling asleep onto his steak.</p>

Day 5<br />
A year ago today, North America&#8217;s security blanket was ripped away, and we were thrust into the global issue of terrorism. Today was a solemn day &#8212; one that Canada has been working towards for a week. Even before I left Calgary, there had been talk of &#8220;September 11th&#8221;, or &#8220;9/11&#8221; as I&#8217;ve often heard it. Funny how the media likes to place &#8220;cute&#8221; names on something so tragic.<br />
I wrote of the [[Reaction to September 11, 2001 (9/11)|event]]. I wrote how I&#8217;d seen people I&#8217;ve worked with for two years left in a complete daze, how little work we actually accomplished, and how I&#8217;d spent hours in front of the television when I&#8217;d got home, just so I could see the same horrific images over and over. Suffice to say, I had more than a few moments of pause a year ago.<br />
Today is considerably different. No-one mentioned anything about today&#8217;s anniversary. It wasn&#8217;t acknowledged by anyone with the CBC or VIA. At least, not on the train. The broadcast media, CBC included, did do their part to mark the occasion; we did not acknowledge the CBC&#8217;s anniversary &#8212; we simply moved on with our day. I didn&#8217;t even really remember the date until later in the day; but I heard not a peep from anyone.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: How could I possibly forget? As bad as it sounds, I was a little preoccupied with a few problems on my laptop that needed resolving. Remember the problem Daryl had? Just when I thought I&#8217;d had the problem licked, it hit me too.<br />
I hate computers.<br />
I had to get my computer fixed. I needed to get caught up in journals and photos to upload to the New Media group for the website. But with my system giving me trouble, writing was a significantly larger challenge. Especially with the looming departure deadline. This didn&#8217;t exactly make me a happy camper.<br />
The process I&#8217;m currently using is one we&#8217;d worked out some time ago. I take a template, write out the text, insert the images, and then upload the files to the server to be seen. But editing the template has been extraordinarily difficult, and the upload to the server agonizingly slow. It&#8217;s taken me upwards of an hour just to handle this simple task. And with limited range on the wireless systems, I&#8217;ve been running quite franticly trying to get it done.<br />
One of the things I had wanted to do today with my free time was to visit the Alberta Railway Museum. As I&#8217;d begun in Kamloops, I was going to make a go of doing as much historical rainfanning as possible. Given, I live in Alberta &#8212; Edmonton is about three hours away from my home. But you have to take advantage of situations when they present themselves. My computer, however, needed my attention. That kept me busy for hours, not only ruining my plans, but also setting back my publishing schedule for these journal entries.<br />
Our official goodbye to Enza took place as we boarded our vans to head back to the train. It&#8217;s amazing just how much our team has gelled since we first met a week ago. I feel sorry for Enza &#8212; she wanted to stay on, but couldn&#8217;t spend any more time away from her job. (Like myself, Enza is not with the CBC.) I can&#8217;t imagine what I&#8217;d feel like if I&#8217;d had to leave early.<br />
We left our hotel at 14:30. Having loaded the night before, there was little to do but climb aboard and settle in. I continued to wrestle with my electronic arch-nemesis until we were out of Edmonton&#8217;s wireless communications range. While I did lose out on the wireless connection, I did win the battle and restored functionality to my computer. That earned me my first break in the day.<br />
The single largest problem the crew has when we&#8217;re on the train is entertainment. We often have long stretches of time between stops, and time before bed, with little to do. Some read books, some listen to music, others play games. Remember, we&#8217;re in a ten-foot wide, nine-foot tall steel can with windows. There&#8217;s not much in here, and for a generation brought up on television and living with Internet addictions, idle time is painful.<br />
Tonight, we decided to do something different. One of the advantages of travelling with Frank Leahy and Friends is goading them into doing something. Tonight, we convinced them to lead a jam session in the Bullet Lounge of the Banff Park car.<br />
A few nights earlier, Neil had passed me a CD. It was a little bit country, and a little bit rock &#8216;n roll. It was Neil &#8212; an album he&#8217;d recorded. At first, I didn&#8217;t even recognize the voice. He has a singing voice that should be selling records. Tonight was a chance for him to show everyone what he could do. The rest of us joined in on songs that we knew, and picked up on choruses that were fairly easy to figure out. And we could clap along without too much difficulty.<br />
Naturally, Daryl and his camera were everywhere. He wanted to get as much of this on film as possible. But so did Rob W., whose old-school VHS camcorder is beginning to be a familiar sight. That&#8217;s not counting the dozen or so still cameras that popped flashes for the next two and a half hours.<br />
The band did some music on their own, and sometimes included featured guests, including Neil, and two of the VIA people: Fred and Dennis. Dennis plays with a band in Vancouver, and has the most beautiful singing voice I&#8217;ve heard in years. Of Jamaican background, he regularly pushed &#8220;Frank and the Boys&#8221; to new heights by playing reggae and rock songs. There&#8217;s nothing more interesting than listening to &#8220;Brown Eyed Girl&#8221; being played with a reggae rhythm by a band that primarily plays fiddle music.<br />
People slowly began to trickle out after a while, until finally the small handful that remained called it a night. Tomorrow will be another long day. Colleen Jones joins us for CBC Morning, we have an event in Biggar, and we arrive in Saskatoon tomorrow night. No rest for the weary.</p>

Day 4<br />
There was a neighbourhood outside my lower berth window. As we weren&#8217;t moving, I could only assume we had arrived in Edmonton. At first I thought that maybe we hadn&#8217;t completely arrived yet &#8212; the sound of airplanes flying overhead was misleading. Further investigation revealed that the Edmonton VIA station is across 121st Street from the Edmonton City Centre airport. It&#8217;s only used for small planes.<br />
Our event would be from 15:30 to 20:00, giving us ample time to set up our tents and displays. Even then, people started arriving at 10:00. It seems that no matter where we go, people want to come early for the big show.<br />
The VIA station has a large field next to it (for what reason, I don&#8217;t know). This was an ideal location for putting out all our equipment. The local CBC had already erected a large tent (for news broadcasts, a stage for the band, and for serving a free barbecue dinner). We filled in the area around it.<br />
Our first injury came in the late morning. Bill, one of our technical crew, strained his knee. While not sounding serious, at first we were worried he&#8217;d popped it out. He was taken to a hospital where the injury was proclaimed a strain, and Bill was told to take it easy. There was a time when we thought we would lose Bill for the remainder of the journey. (And during take down in the evening, we really noticed Bill&#8217;s absence.)<br />
I hopped constantly from setting up displays (I ended up leaving CJ being the only person setting up for quite some time) and doing user support. I needed to repair Daryl&#8217;s computer. Without it, he couldn&#8217;t edit video, and that would put him far behind schedule. While I was fiddling around with Windows 2002, I was also talking with technical support in Toronto trying to sort out why our wireless connections weren&#8217;t working.<br />
I think I&#8217;m going to become a luddite. That way I won&#8217;t have to deal with computers any more. I hate computers.<br />
While on the phone with nearly everyone in CBC&#8217;s IT department, we managed to find the culprit to our computer woes. (A very odd conflict between printer driver and the CD-ROM burning software.) Within minutes, Daryl&#8217;s computer was running again. Before I could solve the wireless problems, though, I was called back into the field to finish setting up the nine computers in the New Media tent.<br />
More support calls. But this time to get the passwords to access the kiosk computers. Six of them had a rather annoying bug that prevented people from using our ShowVote application. An easy fix, but without the password I couldn&#8217;t edit the file. Then the Archives needed a small fix, which required another password. Unfortunately, that came too late to make this show. Next time.<br />
Advertising had gone well in Edmonton. The field was full of visitors. For the first time, our tent was busy. Our volunteer, Rob, was outstanding. He worked almost every person coming through, managed to give away hundreds of pens and bookmarks, helped out countless people, and stuck around helping with take down. Rob even showed us a thing or two about giving things away &#8212; tucking a pair of bookmarks under the penclip suddenly meant we could dispose of even more bookmarks. We actually had to tell him to go home. I wish we could take him with us.<br />
Line-ups were many. The museum line, like in Kamloops, was enormous. I don&#8217;t know exactly how many people saw the exhibits, but we estimate about 2,000 visitors walked through in the four and a half hours. The line for the free barbecue was even larger. At one point, there must have been at least 300 people waiting for their dinner.<br />
The Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, the Honourable Lois E. Hole, came out to visit. She was interviewed by the CBC, as were several other celebrities including Dakota House (of North of 60 fame) and Sharon Lewis from ZeD.<br />
People kept arriving, right until 20:00. I felt sad for having to turn people away. But we needed to pack everything back into the train. Although we were staying in hotel, the train needed to move from the station &#8212; though for what reason I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Either way, we&#8217;re not about to leave our equipment outside all night.<br />
The sun set, the temperature dropped, and the wind picked up. We didn&#8217;t get much of a chance to shiver &#8212; we were too busy paking everything up, and hauling it back to the train. The crew had to pull the lights not long after it got dark, requiring flashlights to make sure we didn&#8217;t miss anything. Soon, the field was (relatively empty) and all that was left was to put everything back on the train. That was right about when my left forearm started going numb. It wasn&#8217;t from the cold &#8212; I think it&#8217;s Repetitive Strain Injury. Having spent the last half of my life parked in front of a computer, I suspect my forearms are due for total seizure before too long. Add that with hauling a lot of heavy boxes and stands around for a few hours a day&#8230;<br />
Finally, around 23:30, we broke for the hotel. We were all exhausted. Especially Neil, who had stayed up until 02:00 the previous night until the train was in Edmonton. He slept during the drive to the hotel.<br />
Several of us started to gather in the hotel&#8217;s atrium to sit, relax, share stories and a few drinks. We ate pretty much nothing but peanuts. The conversation was lively, and even after a hard day no-one seemed to be tired &#8212; mentally, that is. The group would carry on until well into the morning; I headed to long before them.<br />
Tonight, we bade farewell to Enza. She is the first of our group to rotate out. Enza was one of our coordinators and Jill of all trades. When we needed something done, there was Enza. She now returns to her life in Banff. Of course, we wish her well.</p>

Day 3<br />
I awoke to the sun peeking through my blind. Outside, the sky was partly cloudy, the sun climbing over the mountains, and elk traipsing through the CN rail yard. It was then I remembered the morning activity.<br />
The night before, Ivan had suggested we visit a glacier while we were in the area. Most of the group had never seen a glacier before, and it would have been shame to have the time and not use it well. I&#8217;d visited the Athabasca Glacier two years ago, but hadn&#8217;t been to any others. Besides, I&#8217;m a sucker for a side-trip. I hauled myself out of bed and went to see if plans had formulated during my rest. Ivan came through with a plan to see Mouth Edith Cavell.<br />
I skipped breakfast, preferring to take in the gorgeous Jasper morning (the last time I&#8217;d been there, it was overcast almost the entire time), take a few pictures, and walk around a bit before our shuttles appeared. That&#8217;s not to say that our food service has not been exquisite. VIA&#8217;s Chef Paul has an uncanny ability to create a meal that could make Ghandi break a fast. (Yes, that was a pun. Deal with it.)<br />
Our tour buses (vans that can hold ten passengers) arrived and whisked us away. Our guide, Murray, had been in the area for 14 years and was an expert on Jasper National Park. He began his tour as soon as we pulled away from the train. This involved local history, descriptions of flora and fauna, and stories of things he&#8217;d seen and done, peppered with answers to questions we asked along the way. And we had time &#8212; Mount Edith Cavell is fairly close to Jasper, but as it is a mountain, there&#8217;s a 45-minute trip to the start of the hike. There was plenty to see and hear along the way.<br />
Part of the drive was along the original Icefields Parkway, built by Depression-era labourers. By hand. Back then, heavy equipment was too expensive or too difficult to use in the area. Besides, it kept hundreds of men working at a time. Eventually, the road was replaced with a faster, more modern road. The original still serves a vital connection into the mountainous areas, and allows visitors a chance to get closer to the natural beauty of the parks.<br />
The temperature was noticeably cooler when we arrived at the parking lot near the base of Edith Cavell. We gathered into our respective groups (one per van), and headed out to the trails. One went up on the lateral morraine, allowing a spectacular view of the valley, the other along the valley floor. Both under the nose of the mountain.<br />
Mount Edith Cavell is named for a World War I British nurse stationed in Brussels. When the German army occupied the Netherlands, she stayed behind to take care of the captured soldiers. What the German Army didn&#8217;t know was that she was also smuggling them out through an underground railway to safety. When the German Army found out what Edith was doing, she paid for her courage with her life. In tribute, the Canadian Geographic Board renamed one of the most majestic peaks in Jasper National Park in her name.<br />
Once upon a time, barely a few hundred years ago, ice filled the valley. With the changes in global weather (not all as a result of global warming), the ice has receded to form two glaciers: Angel Glacier, which flows along the bottom of the valley; and Ghost Glacier, which hangs down from the peak. In a few years, there won&#8217;t likely be any glacier left. It&#8217;s almost all melted.<br />
We met at the glacial pool. The view was unearthly. Shaped blocks of ice surrounded by jagged blocks of rock, a brisk wind, diminutive trees, and huge walls of rock and ice towering over our heads. The Athabasca Glacier had been a new experience two years ago. I didn&#8217;t think Edith Cavell would be much different. Instead, I&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s something everyone physically capable should see.<br />
Having a time restriction, we couldn&#8217;t stay too long. After a few minutes at the pool (and retrieving a few stragglers who were venturing too close to the glacier&#8217;s edge), we made a hasty return to the train to begin set up for our afternoon event. It would be almost the same as the Kamloops event, just with a different station and train configuration. The trick was that most of the equipment we needed for the event was on the wrong side of the yard. A borrowed cube van solved that problem.<br />
While the others headed off to set up, I started trying to resolve a problem with our network connectivity. Among my duties is system support, liasing with the IT group in Toronto. CBC has spent a large amount of money trying to get us wireless network connectivity across Canada. However, we haven&#8217;t had a wireless signal since Vancouver. A few people were anxious to check email. Nearly two and a half hours of phone calls produced little more than an earache. It wasn&#8217;t IT&#8217;s fault &#8212; Telus, it seemed, didn&#8217;t have a compatible wireless network in Jasper.<br />
The earache became a major headache when Daryl&#8217;s computer began misbehaving. Oddly enough, about when we were testing the wireless connection using his system. (Daryl and I have the same model of computer. In fact, mine is a mirror of his. It&#8217;s meant as a backup should his ever suffer a catastrophic failure. My system, thankfully, hadn&#8217;t had the trouble Daryl did.) Soon, he was almost entirely unable to work on his video clips. Having a background in user support, I used my bag of virtual tricks to try and fix his laptop. But it rebelled, and soon I had to give up, lest I destroy his work. We will need to address it in Edmonton.<br />
Leaving the train, I headed over to the event to take pictures and help out. But help was not needed. Due to confusion in advertising, the event wasn&#8217;t properly promoted in Jasper. The crowds we expected were not to be had. We did attract a lot of tourists (especially when Frank Leahy and Friends were playing), but few of them had even heard of the CBC.<br />
The afternoon passed slowly. It drizzled periodically for flavour, and didn&#8217;t really ever get that warm. Rose wandered the streets passing the word. Debbie donned the Franklin the Turtle costume for the kids. (She tragically fell to the adolescent male dream of kicking a costume character in the groin. Luckily, she found it humorous. Hysterical, actually. To the point where the only reason she had to get out of the suit was that she couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Roger didn&#8217;t find it even remotely funny, and cast a bone-freezing stare at the boys when they came through the museum. He refused them access to &#8220;Be An Anchor&#8221; until they&#8217;d apologized to Franklin.)<br />
One thing that filtered out during the day was some of the previous night&#8217;s activities. (You hear all sorts of interesting stories as the day moves on.) Most of the crew ended up at the Athabee &#8212; that much you already know (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Kamloops]]). It&#8217;s what happened after we left&#8230; The group I was with managed to get back to the train. No harm there. The thought of looking for a bear apparently didn&#8217;t last long, and soon was abandoned. But that was us &#8230; the remainder of the band, however, had an interesting night.<br />
The story, or at least as I understand it, was that the band returned to the train after us. Only they didn&#8217;t take a taxi, and didn&#8217;t know the route around the rail yard. So they went through the middle of it, just missing an incoming freight train. They found their luck had held when told (upon reaching the train) that they had narrowly missed meeting a bear in the darkness of the yard.<br />
We mercifully closed down at 18:00, allowing us to get packed up and wait for the train to reform at the platform. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Jasper was really nice. But with so few people out in attendance, we really had very little to do. It was mostly for boredom that we wanted to pack up. I think all of us were concerned this might become a trend.<br />
The train pulled away from the station a couple of minutes behind schedule, and headed on its way eastward through the park. This was a stretch I&#8217;d wanted to see since my trip out last October. But sadly, it was dark by the time we&#8217;d reached Jasper Lake. It was too dark to see the Prairie Creek Trestle at all &#8212; though we could hear it very clearly. We passed Hinton without fanfare (or notice) and I was barely awake enough to spot Edson.<br />
Tomorrow is another day, and another full event.</p>

Day 2<br />
Most of us didn&#8217;t go to sleep right away. We may have climbed into bed, but those of us with windows opened our blinds, and watched the stars, the curving of the train, and the hollow blackness of the tunnels. The sharp blats of the horn echoed eerily in the treed valleys. It&#8217;s not a sound we&#8217;re used to hearing. All of this left us a little groggy when we awoke to the rising sun. Our train had arrived during the night, parking at the Lorne Street train station in Kamloops.<br />
Kamloops was our second show. This time we would only open the museum cars &#8212; what we called a partial event &#8212; we did not have enough time to do a full event. Even with the lessened load, we still had to set up stanchions, signage, and stairs in and out of the cars. It was a far easier show than the full event, for that we were thankful.<br />
Like with Vancouver, people arrived before we were ready. A lot of people in Kamloops are CBC fans &#8212; we soon had a line of hundreds of visitors. We were expecting the smaller communities to have proportionally larger turnouts, but this was a pleasant surprise.<br />
My job for the day, not having a group of computers to watch over, was greeting visitors and handing out stickers and tattoos for the kids. This was a welcome change of pace. The New Media tent is a little quiet, so having to welcome passers-by opened the door for conversation. Stefani and I guarded the north entrance, welcoming people and answering questions. It was also a chance to get to know another new friend.<br />
About an hour after the event began, I started my photography circuit. One of several duties, I take all the pictures for the website and for archival purposes. As I took pictures of the stage, I happened to notice an otherwise innocuous number just to the left of the stage&#8217;s awning: 2141. One of my personal tasks as this trip proceeds is to find vintage railway equipment. This was my first find: ex-CNR #2141, a 2-8-0 Consolidation steam locomotive.<br />
Entering the office, I inquired about the possibility of seeing the engine before the train left. Unfortunately for me, today was supposed to be an operational day for 2141. But since we were sitting at the station it would use, there would be no steam on the tracks today. Luckily, one of people in the storefront was the wife of one of 2141&#8217;s mechanics. She graciously volunteered to take me over to the train, housed in a shed barely 100 metres from our train.<br />
In retrospect, I wish I had taken my camera with me to take pictures of Julie and Neil&#8217;s faces when I asked if I could disappear for 15 minutes to take pictures. It was perhaps the most incredible look of &#8220;What???&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever seen. Up until that point, I don&#8217;t think either of them really knew just how much of a rail fan I am.<br />
For the last eight years, the Kamloops Heritage Railway have toiled over rebuilding the engine to working condition. It had been on static display in Riverside Park for 33 years, and needed a lot of work. When donated to the KHR, they had to reduce it to spare parts and start almost from scratch. Many of the parts had to be rebuilt. Just last year, the engine was moved to its current home where the Heritage society keeps loving care of it.<br />
The firebox was still warm from yesterday&#8217;s excursion. Every unpainted metal surface gleamed. (6060&#8217;s surfaces, by comparison, need a lot of cleaning and polishing.) I marvelled at the craftsmanship the Kamloops Heritage Railway had put into the rebuilding. 2141 looked like it had just rolled off the assembly line. Not bad for a 90 year-old.<br />
I had a short period of time, so took my pictures quickly. As I ran around the engine, my personal guide told me of the story of restoration. It was a tale I would love to tell, but there were simply too many details to remember. I need to remember to bring my notepad in the future.<br />
Returning to the train, we left 2141 sitting proudly in its house, a little engine that did.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t the only one working on side projects &#8212; Emma was off on a quest of her own. But it wasn&#8217;t to find a train. (I would find out later that Emma would have liked to come with me to see 2141. I&#8217;ll need to keep that in mind when we get to Montreal.) She was looking for the nearest bar. It sounded like a really good idea &#8212; get in a quick drink, and then off to our next exotic location! Capital thinking, I say.<br />
The line-up had continued to stretch during my time away, and we were only open for another hour. We felt sorry for those who wouldn&#8217;t make it into the museum before we had to close the doors. In hopes of lessening broken hearts, we started telling visitors that they might not be able to see the museum. Very few turned away. When the doors did finally close, those who were turned away were understanding. In all, we think about 1,200 people managed to go through the museum in the three hours!<br />
Being such a small event, we were able to pack up our things much more quickly. Within an hour, we were ready to leave. Only mid-afternoon, we were promised glorious sights as we headed into the mountain passes.<br />
So, of course, it rained.<br />
There&#8217;s something strangely comforting about rain. We sat in our cars, working, resting, playing, and glancing out through the water-streaked windows. The rain seemed to make the forests pop into life and the mountains to gleam. Everyone fell into a relaxation that made it feel like we&#8217;d been together far longer than we had. A few people read, some glanced out windows, Patrick even did some magic tricks. Apparently, he did a stint with the Cirque du Soliel!<br />
I spent some time in the dome, sitting near David and Paul. The two of them stared out the windows like the rest of us. But instead of looking for scenery, I think they were scanning for a punchline. Sure enough, it came when we passed a field full of horses. Paul&#8217;s comment: &#8220;[Those are] funny-looking cows&#8230;&#8221;<br />
The train snaked its way through the forests, stopping periodically to let a freight train pass. The rain dwindled as the light faded. Just before it got too dark to see anything, we were fortunate to pass Pyramid Falls. Too dark for a clear photograph, I opted for a short snippet of video. Daryl, our videographer / video producer, got a similar pass with his video camera. I can&#8217;t wait to see how clear his version is.<br />
We arrived in Jasper at about 23:00 MDT, well ahead of schedule. This left us ample time to have nightcap. When word circulated that bars were open until 02:00, almost the entire CBC crew fled to the Athabee &#8212; a bar in the Athabasca Hotel. The band nearly tripped over each other trying to get out of the train. I couldn&#8217;t move fast enough (we had to shut down all our computers so the train could be split), and had to wait until everything stopped moving.<br />
I waited for Neil, Julie, and Debbie to get everything sorted out before we walked over. As we waited, the VIA crew split the train. This doesn&#8217;t sound like much, until you&#8217;re near the brake line. It&#8217;s a loud bang when the line couplers come apart and the air-pressure explodes out. I&#8217;ve heard it many times. Debbie, however, had not. The sound caused her to leap about four feet in the air, near-screaming a Newfie blurt of surprise (something like &#8220;Geezusmarymurphy!&#8221;), leaving Julie, Neil, and I doubled over laughing.<br />
Confusion soon reigned. Julie and I somehow managed to lose Neil and Debbie. Then we couldn&#8217;t find everyone else. We checked surrounding bars, just in case. Nothing. We did find Richard, though, who had decided the bar wasn&#8217;t for him and was heading back to the train. We did eventually find the team, though, buried in a corner of the Athabee lounge. There we remained until roughly closing time.<br />
Our group, not only the CBC crew but also Frank Leahy and his band, are a lot of fun. There&#8217;s nothing more frustrating than travelling with people who don&#8217;t enjoy the journey. Part of every journey is stopping and smelling the roses. While we weren&#8217;t smelling all that great when we left, the time we spent sharing silly stories and making fun of each other was well worth the lost sleep we would experience.<br />
Things got more interesting when we tried to get back to the train. While we were at the Athabee, VIA cut the train in two pieces. The museum cars, the Banff Park, and the generator flat car were left at the station platform. The rest of the train, including our beds, were on the south side of a large, busy rail yard. As we left the train, VIA told us how to get back. But we couldn&#8217;t find a taxi, let alone the three or four we&#8217;d need. So we walked.<br />
It&#8217;s a long walk. You can&#8217;t (nor should) walk through a busy rail yard. That&#8217;s just asking for trouble. (Trains can come in very quickly, and without warning. Cars in the yard can start moving without sound. And you can&#8217;t see all the nasty stuff sitting on the ground.) Having run around the Jasper yard from my trip with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society last October (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]), I knew where we were going and how to get there. Wearing only a T-shirt in the nippy night air just made the trip a little more urgent.<br />
A few people in our rather large ensemble decided, upon arriving at the train, that they needed to find a bear. (The logic of drunk people is just stunning sometimes.) Knowing much better, I crawled into bed, and was soon dreaming of trains.</p>

Day 1<br />
I awoke this morning feeling quite drained from the last few days of toil, and the previous night&#8217;s sake. But within minutes of my rising, adrenaline was already flooding my veins. It was going to be a good day. That was assuming the weather held. It wasn&#8217;t looking very promising glancing out the window. The Weather Network said it wouldn&#8217;t rain. I wasn&#8217;t too sure. Many times I&#8217;ve seen the forecast proven wrong in Vancouver.<br />
Breakfast was early, and fast. We had to be checked out, with our bags at the train this morning. We would have no time to return to the hotel to get anything. By the time we arrived at the station at 7:40, the technical crew had already started pulling out our equipment. We had until 11:00 to get it all set up before the crowds started arriving. Though we had done it only once before, set up was becoming a practiced routine. We had little worries of making our deadlines.<br />
Through the chill of the overcast morning, we pitched tents, set up tables, erected stands, powered computers and televisions, and set out the giveaways. We didn&#8217;t have to wait long &#8212; the crowds arrived and were lining up before we were done. I&#8217;d been expecting more of a sudden flood of people as the doors officially opened, but that never happened. People just started showing up. Before long, we had people everywhere. It was a bona fide event.<br />
It looked like a small carnival. Only without animals. And rides. We had clowns, though, and lots of performers. So all in all, it wasn&#8217;t too far off. The show drew out friends of mine from Vancouver, including my friend Joel and his family. Joel nearly cried when he saw the Friendly Giant&#8217;s castle, and was thrilled to meet some of the local CBC celebrities. Joel is possibly the largest fan of the CBC I have ever met. And he doesn&#8217;t even watch hockey&#8230;<br />
Celebrities weren&#8217;t exactly out in droves, we had a lot more than I thought we would. The cast of Edgemont (a show that, admittedly, I&#8217;ve never heard of) were signing autographs. Not far away was the cast of Royal Canadian Air Farce. Brian Williams frequented the Sports tent, when he wasn&#8217;t wandering around meeting people. There was also another sports icon, whose name I&#8217;ve already forgot.<br />
The next five hours flitted by like hummingbirds &#8212; bobbing, weaving, and very quick. During that time, we entertained several thousand loyal CBC viewers and listeners. The only way we really knew time was passing was when bands changed. Most were good, but didn&#8217;t attract a lot of listeners. One band, Cherry Bomb, got attention by playing &#8220;Time After Time&#8221; and had people guess who they were covering (Cyndy Lauper). A lucky fan got a free CD.<br />
Our two museum cars, including the &#8220;Be An Anchor&#8221; exhibit were extremely popular. I have no idea how many people ultimately went through the cars, but those who did only raved about what we had brought along. For many, most my age, it was seeing the castle from The Friendly Giant, and the treehouse and Tickle Trunk from Mr. Dressup.<br />
As the day went on, the clouds parted and the sun blessed our celebration. The temperature rose along with spirits. But time was disappearing quickly, and the crew knew it. We were excited, and also nervous. We had a huge hurdle ahead of us, and I don&#8217;t think any of us felt confident enough to say that we would make our deadline. Positive outlooks, however, do wonders.<br />
Before we knew it, Colin James (the last performer) was taking the stage. That was our sign to start striking our sets. We had to take things apart discreetly, as not to interfere with the concert. It was a little tricky, though &#8212; we had to make sure our equipment was protected until collected for the train.<br />
When Colin James finished, the remaining crowds started to disperse, and we moved into high gear. The train was leaving at 19:00, with or without us. Our previous experience had told us that it would take an hour and a half to pack our equipment into the baggage car, not counting the time to strike our sets. The added complexity, however, was that we couldn&#8217;t just pack everything into the baggage car. Transport Canada rules (and VIA rules) stated we had to keep a corridor open so we could move through the baggage car.<br />
To avoid the problems of our last repack, Neil and the technical crew created a list of items in order of loading and unloading. This would prevent the flood of items appearing at the baggage car, and would suggest what order we had to pack things up. For CJ and I, this meant we had to pack computers early on &#8212; they were packed in the dark, secure recesses of the car &#8212; so they had to go in relatively early. We won&#8217;t see our computers again until Edmonton.<br />
We reloaded in less time. Almost. We would have if we didn&#8217;t have to create an access way through the car. The passage hadn&#8217;t existed before, and the crew had to whack together sheets of plywood and tie it all down before we could roll out. With a great deal of relief, we finished just in time for our departure.<br />
Boarding the Skyline car, I took a place in the dome along with most of the CBC crew. Some of us were very excited to begin our historic journey. Most were just happy to sit down after another hard day&#8217;s work. (Chris was the first person in the crew to take a shower, and looked much happier for it.) I bore a grin that ran ear-to-ear. Riding on trains is something I&#8217;ve always loved, and something that gets stronger with each year. My dream of riding coast-to-coast was about to start. I felt 10 years younger.<br />
A slight jerk, and the train started rolling forward. We waved to those still on the platform as we pulled away. We didn&#8217;t get too far, though &#8212; we needed to pick up our generator, which was waiting on the adjacent track. Once the VIA crew had done their brake test, we were officially off.<br />
As we slowly left the yard, I started to notice people standing on hills, bridges, piles of wood &#8212; whatever could be used to look over fences. Not a lot of people, just a small handful scattered about. Train chasers. They were following the train, and taking pictures. This time, I would be the fox instead of the hound.<br />
The trip out of the Lower Mainland has always been one I&#8217;ve wanted to take. However, the setting sun and rolling clouds reduced our visibility. It was dark by the time we reached Surrey. We never stopped looking out the window, though &#8212; everything was a wonder. We spent as much time staring at the passing lights of Greater Vancouver than we did at our dinner. I don&#8217;t even remember what it was. I think it was also a reward. After all the hard work everyone had put in, this beginning to the trip was a treat far tastier than the most decadent dessert.<br />
Travelling with us is Frank Leahy and his band &#8212; Richard, David, and Paul. The four of them have deadly humour streaks, as we&#8217;re beginning to find out. They kept us laughing most of the way out of the Lower Mainland. Having them as trainmates is a blessing.<br />
I haven&#8217;t been this excited about a trip since &#8230; well, it&#8217;s been so long that I can&#8217;t honestly remember the last time I&#8217;ve been so giddy. Neil and I are almost in competition to see who&#8217;s the most childish with glee. I think he&#8217;s ahead at the moment. But then, he&#8217;s been working on this a lot longer than I have. He definitely has reason to be happy.<br />
I think I may have a very difficult time getting off this train when we reach Halifax.</p>

		<p><cite> [This entry written by Geoff Sowrey, Â©2002 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Text used with permission of CBC. The opinions expressed within do not necessarily reflect those of the CBC, employees, affiliates, or subsidiaries.] </cite>T-Minus 1 day<br />
Unlike previous days&#8217; preparations, we would not haul equipment today. For this, we were very happy. Most of us sported bruises and strained muscles (the puncture wound in my left palm was still sore). A day of lessened physical activity was welcome. But we were not without tasks to accomplish.<br />
The first, and most important, was a safety briefing from VIA Rail. We would not be allowed on the train without it. It was so important that we were held to a tighter schedule than any previous day. The rules were similar to those I&#8217;d received last October when travelling with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society when taking our locomotive out to Jasper (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]). VIA&#8217;s rules are different than CN&#8217;s rules &#8212; mostly because we wouldn&#8217;t be working on the train itself, so some of the safety rules (such as hard hats, steel-toed boots, and safety vests) never came into play. (That said, I had a pair of steel-toed boots with me, just in case.)<br />
Fred and Marie-Claude, our VIA representatives, took us through the train and explained the details and the dangers the train, including specifics of each rail car. Among them: always wearing footwear. (Inside the cars weren&#8217;t such a danger, but going between cars could result in serious injury if you weren&#8217;t paying attention.) Water was rationed &#8212; we have a limited supply between stations. As such, showers are timed. We can&#8217;t flush toilets in stations, unless we&#8217;re told otherwise. (VIA&#8217;s Budd cars do not carry black water retention tanks &#8212; waste dumps directly onto the tracks.) And above all else: we had to be punctual. VIA&#8217;s trains run at the blessing of CN&#8217;s schedules; to vary the time of departure is to invite many delays.<br />
The briefing shifted from the train to a classroom in the Maintenance Centre. (The whiteboard was covered with instructions on how to perform a proper fill weld.) The safety briefing mostly took place here, with Earl conducting most of the more serious stuff. Daryl floated around the room, his video camera catching almost everything.<br />
We were to go to CBC&#8217;s Vancouver office at 10:30 for an employee celebration. The orientation ran long, however, and we ended skipping the party. No-one seemed to mind too much, preferring to take the afternoon off for relaxing and get in a little sight-seeing. It would be our last day before the trip fully began, and some had never been to Vancouver before.<br />
For me, it was time to do laundry. I had been away from home already for a week, and I doubted I would be able to wash clothes before Edmonton. Luckily, the Holiday Inn had three washing machines, none of which were in use. All I had to do was obtain change (which I got from the front desk) and some laundry soap. Fabric softener, for the traveller, is a bit of a luxury item. That, and I was too lazy to buy any. A tiresomely trivial task, I did allow myself time during the dry cycle to get lunch at Kitto, a Japanese Restaurant on Granville Street.<br />
Post-laundry was my Vancouver photo shoot. Having lived in Vancouver for two years, I was already familiar with the sights I wanted. So why bother taking pictures? For starters, I didn&#8217;t really have any decent pictures of Vancouver. It&#8217;s a common theme &#8212; you never take pictures of the city you live in. Part of my job is to take pictures for the trip, and because we&#8217;re in Vancouver, I need pictures of this city for the website. But also because I knew a lot of the people on the trip wouldn&#8217;t get to see very much, and I wanted them to see what Vancouver has to offer.<br />
I moved quickly from the hotel down to Burrard Inlet to obtain a panorama of the harbour and mountains. I passed Amy and Chris coming the other direction. I guess they didn&#8217;t see me, as I said &#8220;hello&#8221; and got nothing in return. (Mind you, they claim the opposite. Who knows what happened!) I took pictures of the waterfront, then moved down to Waterfront Station (CPR&#8217;s second railway station in Vancouver) for a few more pictures. Then it was to nearby Gastown for a picture of the neighbourhood and the famous steam clock. I thought about a return visit to Granville Island, but I decided the pictures I shot there (see [[Visiting More in Vancouver]]) were good enough.<br />
By the time I returned to the hotel, my feet were pounding. The activities of the last few days had turned my poor feet to greasy spoon-grade hamburger. They, and I, needed a rest. I thought about just sitting around until the feeling came back into my soles, but I made the mistake of laying down for a moment when dropping things off in my room.<br />
I woke just before 17:30, which was when we were meeting at Panama Jack&#8217;s, a bar attached to the Holiday Inn. There, the Executive Producer of the 50th Anniversary Project, Pia Marquard held a cocktail party for we brave souls.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t really met Pia before, having only heard her name a couple of times. I expected a stereotypical television producer. Instead, I found her a wonderful person to talk to &#8212; and she was actually interested in things I had to say! Not being a CBC employee, I&#8217;ve never dealt with a television producer before. All the stories I hear about producers generally make them evil in ways that chill even the hardiest of souls. I felt a lot better about the trip when I realized the person in charge really cared about what we did.<br />
At least until she mentioned that she produced the first Survivor. We all laughed, nervously.<br />
We toasted the work we had already done, commented on the work that was yet to come, and lauded Julie and Neil. They truly are our Fearless Leaders, pulling a very large rabbit out of a very small hat. I just hope that all of their hard work is seen by as many Canadians as we hope to see. It would be a tragedy if all these efforts go to waste.<br />
CJ and I also had a detente, and reconciled. I was very happy to put our disagreement behind us and move forward. We have to rely on each other extensively to pull this little trick off, and having two people at odds with each other was only heading towards disaster.<br />
Everyone talked, mingled, tried to get to know one another a little better, and snacked a little on the pub fare circulating the premises. But when you&#8217;re in a city like Vancouver, bar food really doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. I mean, when you&#8217;re in a world-class city, you want to eat world-class food. It sounds a little petty, perhaps, but it really does add to the experience.<br />
For the last couple of days, Emma and I had been discussing the need for good sushi. Although I&#8217;d had some for lunch, there is no comparison, no contest for good sushi. Luckily, Emma and I knew of a place: Hiro. Or at least that&#8217;s what we thought it was called. No entries in the phone book, nothing even hinted of by the hotel staff. How Emma eventually found it, I&#8217;m not sure. I can be certain that after all this grief, I&#8217;ll never forget the name &#8220;Shiro&#8221; again.<br />
We would have been off with eight others, but suddenly our sushi crew disappeared on us. Emma and I had to settle for an evening gorging ourselves on what we think is the best sushi in the Lower Mainland, and possibly Canada. Fresh unfrozen tuna, fresh wild Pacific salmon, and rolls so luscious that I still salivate at the thought. Two bottles of sake only added to the experience. (And also got up the gumption to try deep-fried shrimp heads. Although surprisingly tasty, they are slightly unattractive.)<br />
We pitied those who decided to go somewhere else. We took pictures for posterity. And for gloating.<br />
We wanted to stay much longer. Have more sake, eat more sushi, try other things on the menu. Responsibility tends to put a damper on things, and we ended up leaving after only a couple of hours. Tonight, we will sleep well. For tomorrow, the show begins.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 2 days<br />
I think it&#8217;s safe to say no-one left today&#8217;s event pain-free. This was the VIP Event day. This  was when we had to be near perfect, as the executives from both CBC and VIA would be on hand,  along with many other invited parties and members of the media. We had to shine. We had to be  as close to perfect as we could be, considering none of us had put our displays together  before.<br />
One thing this day did bring was an introduction to Catherine (also known as CJ), my tent-mate.  I&#8217;m responsible for New Media and Showvote. CJ covers the Archives material.<br />
Somehow, I ended up being the tent chief. That just means I get to carry a walkie-talkie. It&#8217;s  the first time I&#8217;ve ever carried a walkie-talkie. There&#8217;s an etiquette to using walkie-talkies,  which includes using &#8220;roger&#8221; and &#8220;over&#8221; during transmissions, and waiting for others to finish  conversations. It&#8217;s fun, but I was always a little nervous before broadcasting to the crew.<br />
We started in the morning hauling out all the equipment, and then putting it all together. By  11:00, we&#8217;d had almost everything in place. This surprised even me, considering we had nine  computers, and an awkward (and heavy) central triangular stand. Yet CJ, Brenda, and I managed  to put it all together. We tweaked the configurations well into the afternoon, though,  finishing just as the executives began their walkaround.<br />
One of the purposes of the VIP event was to raise awareness of CBC Television&#8217;s 50th  anniversary. The other was to provide the official kick-off, including a ribbon-cutting  ceremony. I&#8217;ve never been to one that large. It&#8217;s a bit of a thrill, despite the  pretentiousness.<br />
Volunteers started arriving about 30 minutes before the start of the event. These were local  people, either from the CBC or from local schools. Our volunteers, Jaiman and Peter, were both  students who received the call through email. They didn&#8217;t need to do much &#8211; just ensure that  people were able to use the systems. Other volunteers needed to watch activities and help hand  out giveaways.<br />
Among the crowd were several celebrities, mostly with the CBC. Announcements came from Ian  Hanomansing and Gloria Macarenko, both of whom feature prominently on CBC news. The big speeches  came from Brian Williams (of CBC Olympic coverage fame) and Luba Goy from the Royal Canadian  Air Farce.<br />
Ms. Goy seems to have two settings: On and Really On. When motioned to stretch her speech due  to time restrictions (we were going live with Canada Now, and had to synchronize our activities  with their schedule), she dove off into tangents and accents that had many people crying.<br />
Finally, the moment came, and Carole Taylor, the Chair of the CBC, took centre stage. A very  eloquent woman (but with some trouble annunciating French), she made a wonderful speech about  how CBC has changed Canada and moulded Canadian culture. (If you don&#8217;t think so, answer this:  can you hum the theme to Hockey Night In Canada? The Friendly Giant? Do you know what a Tickle  Trunk is?)<br />
Following Ms. Taylor was the Honourable Jean Pelletier, the chair of VIA Rail Canada. Mr.  Pelletier&#8217;s speech echoed the thoughts of Ms. Taylor&#8217;s, but with a decidedly stronger slant to  railroads.<br />
At the end of this speech, Ms. Taylor and Mr. Pelletier took a place in front of the ribbon,  while Luba and Brian finished off the ceremony. Then all eyes turned to the gold scissors as  they cut the tape away, opening the train, and starting our journey.<br />
The event soon faded away as people went through the train, and disappeared into the oncoming  evening. We were to wrap up at 19:30, but a couple tents started at 19:00. This, sadly, caused  me some friction that nearly ruined a good team.<br />
I was using Neil as my touchstone for when things were to happen. According to Neil, we were to  strike at 19:30. So I wanted to hold off. However, CJ was told to start striking. This caused  miscommunication, and temperatures rose far higher than should have been allowed.<br />
We persevered through the difficulties, and finished packing up. This is where we ran into our  second snag. Having never fully repacked the baggage car, we didn&#8217;t brought everything back all  at once. This has the effect of trying to empty a bathtub into a garden hose all at once.<br />
Gerry (our Crew Chief) managed the repacking, but had to make a lot of decisions when faced  with the flood of returned equipment set materials. It took nearly an hour and a half, but  finally the last item disappeared into the baggage car. Total time: nearly three hours. Two  times as long as we had hoped for. (In Winnipeg, we have only an hour and a half to do the same  job.) Although disappointed, we were too tired and too sore to worry too much.</p>

		<p>T-minus 3 days<br />
I awoke with my alarm ready for a day of discovery. That was important because I had only met three people in the crew of 30-odd. When I arrived in the restaurant for breakfast, I stared at a seemingly endless sea of unfamiliar faces. I ate breakfast alone, partly because I still have a weird shyness complex, and also because I needed to review my notes. (If anyone asks, I&#8217;m sticking with the latter reason.)<br />
Walking into this entire affair, I&#8217;d had many questions and concerns. I had many reservations. I didn&#8217;t know whom I could rely on for help. Over the last two months, I came to know the management of this project. With that familiarity came comfort that things were under control. Today just reinforced that.<br />
I boarded the shuttle to Pacific Central station, barely knowing a person. I didn&#8217;t even know who my tent-mate was. I had talked to her on the phone, but you really don&#8217;t get an impression for them with a short conversation. We had work to do, and all I could do was just follow the crowd and fill in the blanks as I went along.<br />
The first big help was courtesy of Ivan, the Museum curator. He had made name tags for everyone in the crew so we wouldn&#8217;t have so much trouble with names. (And also so guests would know who were are.) Besides, &#8220;Hi My Name Is&#8221; stickers look a little goofy.<br />
We started off slowly &#8212; there was little we could do until VIA switched our train (or as much of it as was available) into the station so we could start unloading our stuff. Everyone milled. Some people knew others, but many (like myself) were total strangers. I figured out who Daryl was early on &#8212; he had the video camera. Ivan and I met in the opening stages, as well, learning that we were both part of historical rail societies.<br />
This was our first practical introduction to everything we have to work with over the next 37 days. Some of us had attended a meeting in Toronto a couple of weeks earlier that included basics with the tent. I saw a video. So actually getting a chance to fully set the equipment up was not only important, but helpful.<br />
I had never been on VIA&#8217;s Budd cars before. (These are the stainless steel passenger cars most visible on The Canadian.) Formerly of the Canadian Pacific Railway, VIA inherited the cars when taking over passenger service in Canada. As we wandered through the cars, it suddenly became real. This was really happening.<br />
For the last two months, I was living in a bit of a daze. When Brenda had approached me with this project, I felt like someone had a conduit into my dreams. Though I was active in planning and development, I still felt separated. Now I was in the thick of it. These were the people on the train. I would work and live with them for over a month. This was the train. There was no doubt any more, not even a hint of possibility. This was it.<br />
Today was my introduction to the team. I hovered rather than directly introduced, allowing time for acceptance and for adjustment. The team is going to be everything for the next month, and I want to get off on a good start. Besides, I don&#8217;t want to bombard them with the Full Geoff. (Sometimes, I&#8217;m a little much.)<br />
We set up tents in the morning. The original plan was to do full set ups and strikes (taking everything down) as many times as possible so we&#8217;d be comfortable with the system. But an unexpected arrival of the Rocky Mountaineer from Kamloops derailed us, and we had to stop.<br />
During our break, Earl (the director of VIA&#8217;s Vancouver Maintenance Centre) took us into the maintenance building to see our lead locomotive. VIA #6403, a GMD F40PH-2 diesel electric locomotive, sat in its CBC 50th Anniversary decaled glory. It sat proud, looking like a cat that had just finished cleaning itself, ready for petting.<br />
After lunch, we emptied the baggage car and made an attempt to see what we could make of the equipment. I was happy to see that all the computers and monitors had survived the trip. I was ecstatic to see that all the problems I&#8217;d seen in Toronto had been solved. Blake, one of the wunderkinds of the CBC interactive group, had worked magic that even Gandalf would not challenge.<br />
We worked the whole day, at least when we weren&#8217;t halted by a train or by some other activity that needed our attention. Tests, checks, experiments, and finally decisions. When we were done, there was a feeling of accomplishment (though a few people thought we didn&#8217;t do enough), and of confidence.<br />
Packing everything back up was a bigger challenge. Pulling things out of a baggage car is immeasurably easier than trying to get it back in again. Especially when it needs to be in a specific order. We finished around 21:30 that evening. We called it a night, retiring to the hotel for a rest. The day to come was going to be our real test.<br />
Brenda had arrived in the hotel by that time. She had come out to see how her labours were paying off. Brenda had lost countless days of sleep, and probably gained a few grey hairs working out the details for her department. Now it was time to see if it was all worth it.<br />
Running into Neil in the hotel lobby, he invited me to join him, Brenda, and several others at the bar next door for a quick drink. Brenda and I ended up talking shop the entire time. I told her what I knew. She asked more questions. But in the end, the truth wouldn&#8217;t be known until the next day.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 4 days<br />
First order of the day was to move out of Joel and Michelle&#8217;s piano room. Although I greatly appreciate their hospitality, I do need to be with the rest of the CBC. The show starts tomorrow morning.<br />
I dropped the car off at the Budget Rent-A-Car shortly after 9:00. The car was in the same shape I had received it, save for a few extra kilometres on the odometer. I cabbed it from there to the Lougheed Mall Skytrain station on the new Millennium Line (which opened for service yesterday). No sense in not taking a train when the possibility exists.<br />
The trip on the new line would have been better had I been in the new cars, but they&#8217;re not as frequent as the old ones. But a train ride is rarely bad. Arriving at the Commercial stop, I disembarked and boarded an Expo Line train for the Granville station. From there, it was a 10 minute walk down to the Holiday Inn at the corner of Howe and Helmcken.<br />
Holiday Inn was another important partner in the 50th anniversary celebrations with the CBC. They, too, are having their 50th birthday this year, and have supplied the CBC with hotel accommodations across Canada. For free.<br />
This trip gets better each and every day.<br />
I checked in, dumped off my things, and got to my second order of business: a shower. (Lugging all those things around is a fair bit of work.) Then it was time for the third thing I needed to attend to: lunch.<br />
Every time I come to Vancouver, I have lunch with my friends from Radical. When I used to work there, I would listen to them talk about the projects over Chinese food. Now I listen to them talk about projects in code, so I won&#8217;t hear anything important. The code is sometimes so vague they even stump themselves. Inevitably I can piece things together, but I&#8217;m bound by an informal disclosure agreement, not to mention respect, not to talk about it. So don&#8217;t ask.<br />
Following lunch, I bade farewell and headed towards False Creek Ferries. They&#8217;re my favourite means of transportation to Granville Island. (That, and I forgot about the trolley car.) Picture a bathtub roughly twice the normal size, with an inverted-T top. It&#8217;s small, it doesn&#8217;t move very fast, but it&#8217;s a graceful way to move around False Creek.<br />
No matter how long I&#8217;m away from Vancouver, I always try to visit Granville Island. It&#8217;s by far my favourite place in the city. The smells of fresh fruit and vegetables and breads, the taste of fresh fish, the ambiance of a large community market, and the comfort of a friend. It&#8217;s always worth a side trip.<br />
I had wanted to visit my friend Katrina during my False Creek excursion. (For those of you following the program, this is the same Katrina who had moved to California. Since then, she and her husband moved back to Vancouver, much to everyone&#8217;s delight.) Alas, I had forgotten her phone number in Calgary, and her cellular phone wasn&#8217;t on. We connected later in the day, but only by voice. We tried to make plans to get together that night, but Katrina had to pack for her trip east. Sadly, we will not meet again until later.<br />
Dinner was with Lee and her boyfriend Matt. (You might remember Lee as my &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221; from my days with the Rad Sox softball team.) We were later joined by Neall and his girlfriend Mel. We hoped for more, but in the end fewer people make for better conversation.<br />
We started at a somewhat mediocre Indian restaurant just off Denman. My experiences with Indian cuisine on the West Coast are generally positive. This one was neutral. I wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled, but I&#8217;ve had worse. We moved later to the Sylvia Hotel&#8217;s bar. Slightly on the tacky side, it&#8217;s also lightly travelled, and a place to spot the stars.<br />
We would not have a late night. Though tempting, we all had to work the next day. I didn&#8217;t want to be late.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 5 days<br />
Today was supposed to be tourist day. It was supposed to be sunny and warm, with nice little chirping birds and happy people out enjoying the &#8220;last day of summer&#8221;. (School starts tomorrow.)<br />
So naturally, it rained.<br />
Out here in Maple Ridge, it teemed. I hoped that by the time I got to Howe Sound that either the rain had died out, or was reduced to spittle due to the mountains.<br />
To a degree, I was right. But there was one thing I didn&#8217;t count on &#8211; traffic accidents that snarl up the Sea to Sky Highway. That pretty much ended my excursion to Britannia Mines and the West Coast Railway Association. Maybe the next trip out.<br />
The whole highway thing was a little interesting. As I sat in my rented Chrysler Neon (which I can now confidently say is a poor excuse for a car), I thought about the problem. Whistler wants to host the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. That means a lot of people driving to and from Vancouver. As it stands, the Sea to Sky Highway (also known as Highway 99) can&#8217;t handle that traffic. And in winter conditions, the next Olympic demonstration sport will be the Traffic Accident Slalom. There&#8217;s a lot of problems that the BC government will need to solve before the games start.<br />
I ended up in Horseshoe Bay. The only reason was to have Trolls&#8217; fish and chips, which I remembered quite fondly. But it was an off day, a general slump in quality, or my memory of the fish was distorted. I was not impressed. And they appeared to have taken salmon off the menu. Salmon fish and chips was a delicacy I missed.<br />
On the way back, I stopped into Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. The wine shop I had once been to was still there. I bought a thank you for my gracious hosts for the time and place. Besides, it was a great excuse to go wine hunting &#8211; something I never get tired of.<br />
I had dinner with Greg. It&#8217;s almost bizarre how well Greg and I get along considering how little we see of each other. We worked in the same department for a little over two years, but during those years we were more co-workers than friends. It wasn&#8217;t until I asked him for help when I moved to Calgary that things changed. Since then, he&#8217;s been a good, trusted friend.<br />
Tonight, we had more time together than our last few meetings. This allowed for a nice long steak dinner at a local Joey Tomato&#8217;s, and time to catch up on all the things that had come up in our lives over the last year.<br />
Greg&#8217;s always been an active person who strives to keep himself busy. If he&#8217;s not working, he&#8217;s rock climbing, working in the Hungarian community, or more recently, acting. Personally, I think Greg&#8217;s ideally suited to acting &#8230; for his looks, if nothing else. Hollywood stars should be jealous of him. Acting will let him extend himself past the algorithms he works with all day, and into a stronger right-brain skill set.<br />
We saw a movie following dinner (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, which I recommend highly to anyone who&#8217;s had or seen to too many nuptials in the last two years). We laughed. A lot. A part of me wishes we could have just sat down, shared drinks and talked all night. Greg and I can do that easily. But Greg had to work the next day, and I had to move to a hotel.<br />
Tomorrow is my last &#8220;free&#8221; day before the real work begins. I can&#8217;t tell if I&#8217;m excited or terrified.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 6 days<br />
Today was much quieter than the previous two days &#8230; if you don&#8217;t count two kids, that is.<br />
After waking and spending a morning with Joel and Michelle&#8217;s family, Joel showed me his new pet project. Joel is working on an addition to the Microsoft Flight Simulator, called Squawkbox. It allows virtual pilots to communicate using voice (instead of chat) with virtual air traffic controllers. It also links pilots other pilots. The end result is a simulation that is eerily close to the real thing.<br />
Joel even demonstrated the existing system. He prepared his flight from Boston. This required him to talk with the Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) who &#8220;managed&#8221; Boston. There are two such people: Tower control, and Approach control. Although probably not even in the same city, these two people hand off control to each other, just as would happen in real life. For the end user, the experience is nothing short of completely engaging. I can see why Joel gets so excited when he talks about the system.<br />
Following our virtual fly by of Boston, Joel took me to get a car. Joel and Michelle have been most kind to give me a place to stay. However, being so far out of town, it does require me to rent a car (public transit, though preferable, isn&#8217;t really an option). It&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. I actually like having the car. It gives me more freedom.<br />
The primary reason for the car was a local wedding reception for my friend Nigel. He&#8217;s an former coworker from Radical Entertainment (he&#8217;s still there &#8230; I&#8217;m not). Nigel married his wife, Patricia, the day after my sister and in the adjacent town. [Insert singing and dancing dolls here.]<br />
The party was held in Heritage Hall on Main St. in Vancouver. Until I was a couple of blocks away, I didn&#8217;t know the place. But as I turned onto Main St., suddenly I remembered. Nigel&#8217;s theatre group (Tempest in a Teacup) had put on a show in the basement that I&#8217;d seen a few years earlier.<br />
Not many Radicalites were out, but those who did come still work there. I still miss the company, the people, and the excitement. In the last few months, I&#8217;ve been regretting more and more having left. While I really want to go back, I doubt there is little room for me in the organization. It was a really fun place to work, and despite the hurried schedules of releasing game, Radical had an energy that Critical Mass could never hope to have.<br />
Greg and I had a long talk. It had been a long time since we&#8217;d seen each other, and we had much to discuss. (These journals don&#8217;t cover every detail of my life.) We chat very rarely, on account of how busy we are.<br />
Within a couple of hours, most of the people I knew had filtered out. Those who remained were personable, having talked with several of them before the Radicalites arrived. But I was getting tired, and had an hour drive back to Joel&#8217;s.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it out of downtown. I tried to drive towards the east, but the lure of the city lights drew me downtown, and out to Stanley Park. An imposing feature at night (no lights inside the park), the edges offer some of the best shots of Vancouver at night. I was an hour late getting to bed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>T-Minus 7 days<br />
Five-thirty is an unfair time of the morning. Especially if your alarm clock wakes you in the middle of a really good dream.<br />
This morning, I took a taxi to the BC Rail station and boarded the Cariboo Prospector. It&#8217;s a three-car Rail Diesel Car (RDC) passenger train that runs between Prince George and North Vancouver.<br />
(An RDC, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a self-propelled passenger car. They were developed in the 50s by the Budd Car Company as a means for simple passenger operation without the need for an extra locomotive. For a while, RDCs were a common site in North America. Now they are a dying breed. In Canada, only BC Rail and VIA still run RDCs, and only in three places: Victoria-Courteney on Vancouver Island (VIA), Sudbury-White River in Ontario (VIA), and Prince George-North Vancouver.)<br />
This will be an important trip for me. Due to budget cuts at BC Rail, the Prospector will cease operations at the end of October. This is also true for BC Rail&#8217;s other services, the Pacific Starlight and the Whistler Northwind. The Royal Hudson service already met with an ignominious end when both 2860 and 3716 steam locomotives required maintenance. Their end came in 1999. (2860 is now on display at the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish. 3716 is stored unserviceable at BC Rail.)<br />
It is truly a shame that a service such as this would befall such a fate. While perhaps not the speediest form of transportation, it is very comfortable, and you simply can&#8217;t see this country any other way. And that&#8217;s not to count the necessity. There&#8217;s a native tribe just south of Lillooet that needs the service to get from Lillooet to their home. With the service ending, they needed to contract a shuttle with BC Rail.<br />
It&#8217;s a 15 hour trip from Prince George to North Vancouver. It&#8217;s not only a trip through some of the most beautiful country in Canada, but it&#8217;s also a test of endurance. If you can&#8217;t survive 15 hours on one day, how would you survive 33 days?<br />
This was one day I was happy to endure. The weather wasn&#8217;t the most ideal, admittedly. That didn&#8217;t take away from the majesty of our natural ecosystems or of the sculpted terrain. Though the cloudy skies did bring an early night.<br />
The trip is run as a partial tourist train. It was initially started to serve the countless little communities between the Lower Mainland and Prince George (most of them remnants from the Gold Rush). Either through evolution or through need, it soon became a partial tourist train. As the train rolls along, one of the train crew points out sights and tells some of the local history. The fact that you&#8217;re fed breakfast, lunch, and dinner as you ride is an added bonus.<br />
The only real down side of the trip is that you&#8217;re confined to your car for the duration of the journey. You aren&#8217;t allowed between cars, and most of the stops are too brief to let people off. Between Lillooet and North Vancouver, there was only one stop of sufficient length for people to stretch their legs.<br />
By the time we reached Whistler, it was darkening fast. Not far past the resort, you could barely make out silhouettes, let alone the colours or objects. The remainder of the ride to North Vancouver was quiet and uneventful. Once we entered sight of the Lions Gate Bridge, however, the lights of the night city were spectacular.<br />
My friend Joel and his wife Michelle greeted me at the station. They had offered me refuge for a few days before I started with the CBC. Though they lived nearly an hour out of downtown, the need for rest and quiet were more than appealing enough. Fifteen hours of travel isn&#8217;t physically tiring, but it is draining.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 8 days<br />
There&#8217;s nothing like trying to plan one and a half months of a chaotic life in excruciating detail. It&#8217;s a little easier when someone else does all the dirty work, but ultimately, it&#8217;s you that will make it flow smoothly.<br />
In my case, it was extracting myself from my life. Really, it was the only way to make any kind of a clean break. But in a fashion typical of myself, I still managed to be running around for the last 45 minutes of being at the office. It seems no amount of preparation can prevent that.<br />
Of course, it didn&#8217;t help that Purolator missorted my advance cheque from the CBC. That caused me to call the courier and see if I could divert it to Vancouver. I won&#8217;t know if I was successful until 4 September.<br />
On of the things I left too late was booking a hotel room. Why I left it so late is anybody&#8217;s guess (&#8216;cuz I don&#8217;t know). But it meant that I still needed to clear it up before I boarded my plane.<br />
My flight to Vancouver was its usual uneventful passage. Although I had booked a window seat, I offered it to a young girl who was flying alone and would have sat between two men. The seat was cramped, and not leather (see [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]]). For such a short flight, it wasn&#8217;t necessary. But it would still have been nice.<br />
My stop in Vancouver was short. I almost walked out of one terminal gate and right into the adjacent gate. All that prevented me was a 25-minute wait until the next flight started its boarding call.<br />
I was off to Prince George, &#8220;Gateway to the North&#8221; and the geographical centre of British Columbia. I had exactly the same seat booked that I would have had in the previous flight (had I not given up my window view). But this time, I wanted to see the landscape. We left early (how often that happen?). The flight was short, and soon we arrived at the smallest airport I think I&#8217;ve ever been to. Not many airports require planes to turn around on the runway to get to the terminal.<br />
The terminal building was even smaller than Hamilton&#8217;s. There&#8217;s one baggage carousel, which opens directly to the outside. There&#8217;s one gate. Now that&#8217;s small.<br />
Grabbing an airporter, I found my way to the Downtown Motel. It was, I think, the last available room in Prince George. It wasn&#8217;t the Fairmont Palliser, but it had a comfy bed at a reasonable price. (Even if the room was permeated with a deodourizer that smelled almost worse than the cigarette smoke it was supposed to cover up.)<br />
So why the shortage of rooms? After dinner at the Shogun at the Coast of the North hotel, I wandered around to take pictures. In the process, I ran into three wonderfully chatty elderly women competing in the BC Senior Games. The games are running this weekend in Prince George. Hence, no rooms.<br />
We talked a fairly long time &#8211; they were quite puzzled why I would be running around at night taking pictures. Prince George has some great vistas, including the new art gallery just west of city hall. The lighting at night really brings out the gallery&#8217;s unique construction.<br />
While I was there talking, we were approached by two of the volunteers who were helping at the games. They were wondering what we were talking about. Over the course of a shorter conversation, I found that Prince George has 26 sawmills. While an impressive-sounding number, the reality is much less impressive. Of those, only 11 or 12 are still open.<br />
Bed soon beckoned. I had a very early morning to come, and sleep was a necessity.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Somewhere, in a long-forgotten book in some dusty corner of a decrepit building in a burned out city, there is a sentence that says vacations are supposed to be restful. And someone is going to a lot of trouble to make sure I can&#8217;t find that sentence.<br />
Last week, starting very early on 3 August, I flew to Ontario. As luck would have it, I was on the same red-eye flight with my cousin Pam and her beau, Sean. Normally, this would be reason for celebration, but flying red-eye basically means you sleep the whole way. And believe me, sleeping is far easier with leather seats.<br />
Yes, leather. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten into WestJet, but at least one of their planes has leather seats. Not just one. Not just a few. All of the seats. The only downer: The ones backing onto the emergency exit rows don&#8217;t recline. (I found out the hard way.)<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering what I was doing on a red-eye flight given my dislike for them (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), but it came down to an issue of price. Red-eyes are cheap. And with leather seats, I might be doing more red-eyes in the future.<br />
This was the first time I flew into Pearson on WestJet, and I reminded myself yet again why I hate that airport. It&#8217;s too slow. Cathy was circling for over 20 minutes before hearing from me. I told her to park &#8212; I was going to be a while longer.<br />
Bags in hand, Cathy and I headed to Oakville. Pam and Sean disappeared to Stratford. We wouldn&#8217;t see them again until the following Friday. Arriving home, my mother welcomed me at the door, and I made a beeline for the bed.<br />
Leather seats or not, I didn&#8217;t get enough sleep.<br />
The Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were filled with various wedding-related tasks, not the least of which was picking things up, dropping things off, and getting things organized. (Yeah, real vague, I know, but I&#8217;d be writing an entire log entry just on that stuff alone.)<br />
Oh, whose wedding, you ask? I&#8217;ll give you a hint: Not mine.<br />
After a long wait, my sister&#8217;s beau, Craig, finally proposed to her on Christmas morning (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), making not only Cathy very happy, but the rest of my family as well. And after almost eight long months of waiting, it was time for the happy day to arrive.<br />
I had originally come out to Ontario a week in advance to help out with all the little last-minute details that I expected would crop up. But unbeknownst to me, events would transpire that would change the course of my week.<br />
Details on that in a following log, of course.<br />
Suffice to say, come Tuesday, I was no longer in Oakville. Instead, I spent a lot of time at the CBC head office on Front Street (see [[Working at CBC Headquarters in Toronto]]), working for my friend Brenda. That sucked up pretty much every spare second I had for four days, although I did manage to leave at a somewhat &#8220;respectable&#8221; hour on Thursday to return home for dinner (the family invasion formally began that evening) and early on Friday (for obvious reasons).<br />
But even on Saturday morning, we didn&#8217;t get a chance to slow down. It was go-go-go from the moment my alarm went off at 8:00am. The first task for me was to get Craig and Dave (Craig&#8217;s best man) over to the barber so we could get our haircut. (Mine was looking something like a floor mop.)<br />
Craig and Dave were the first ones up, disposing of their excess locks. Completed, they disappeared off to Craig and Cathy&#8217;s house to await orders. My turn. So in addition to looking respectable again (yeah, tough as that might sound), I also had a shave. A real one. With a straight razor. Luckily, Sandy is one of the best barbers in Ontario; certainly the best I&#8217;ve ever had. I had complete faith in him not to slice something off.<br />
I should point out that I&#8217;ve never had a shave with anything but an electric razor. So my skin is quite sensitive. Sandy had to shave me twice to prevent slicing me open. But he did a good job &#8212; even by 11pm, I hadn&#8217;t grown much of a beard back, and I grow fast.<br />
Following the shave was some chores around the house &#8212; mostly moving things. (Aunt Ruth was madly preparing flowers, which needed placing; Aunt Karen brought a light trellis that needed assembling; and flowers all over the place needed watering.) And somewhere in all that, I ran to the grocery store to stock up on almost $80 in Clamato and orange juice.<br />
After a quick bolt through the shower, I rode over to pick up Craig and Dave. They were dressed in their finest, ready for the show. I piled them into the minivan, and hauled them back to the Sowrey homestead. People had started to arrive, though it was mostly family. But you could hear the Great Engine beginning to turn over&#8230;<br />
Inside, people were officially going crazy. Mom was getting dressed, Cathy was talking with everyone, the caterers were running around &#8230; I almost felt like I was in a Keystone Cops short. But it was time for myself to get dressed. Unlike Craig and Dave, though, I would not be wearing a tux. Cathy had made one request: Wear Dad&#8217;s kilt.<br />
When Dad had been diagnosed with brain cancer, he had been told he had a year to live. All he wanted to know was if he would live to see his daughter&#8217;s wedding. When he passed away in March, there was a hole that needed filling.<br />
Instead of Dad, it would be I who would walk Cathy down the aisle. And she was only walking down it if there was someone next to her wearing Dad&#8217;s kilt. Luckily for me, it fit, albeit a little tight and very warm in that mid-August heat.<br />
Oh, and in case you&#8217;re wondering, I did not wear it regimental style. (That means sans undergarments.) Why? Well, originally I was, but then I remembered all the troublemakers C&amp;C had invited to the party, and suddenly I wasn&#8217;t really filled with a great deal of confidence about their abilities to remain mature. (I was right, too. Cathy&#8217;s boss shoved one of the disposable cameras under my kilt while we were engaged in group photos.)<br />
The minister arrived and gave the &#8220;pep&#8221; talks with Craig and Cathy (independently &#8212; Cathy forbade Craig to see her prior to the ceremony). There was no practice ceremony &#8212; C&amp;C (as we in the family refer to them) like flying by the seat of their pants.<br />
After running around for about 20 minutes, Cathy finally pronounced she was ready. The minister pronounced he was ready. (I don&#8217;t think Craig had a choice.) It was time. The music was cued, and Cathy went out the front door.<br />
The guests waited in the backyard. Cathy, Julie, and I walked to the side. Julie took a deep breath, and then walked through the gate to the snapping of shutters. We&#8217;d been told to give Julie lots of room before coming in. Dramatic pause, dawdling, psychological torture, call it what you will. Right up until we started walking in, arm in arm, Cathy had been cool and collected. The second we rounded that corner, she couldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
I felt a little guilty. This was Cathy&#8217;s big day, and I was sharing the limelight with her. At first, I was just walking my sister. But after a few moments, it suddenly became real. Like someone had wiped the fog from the bathroom mirror. To say the feeling was overwhelming is like suggesting a hurricane is a light breeze. It took everything I had not to cry.<br />
Once Cathy was next to Craig, the ceremony started to take shape, and things went quickly. True to their word, it lasted only 20 minutes before the legalities were over, and the new Mr. and Mrs. were presented to the assembly. Many pictures ensued.<br />
After they ceremoniously walked out as husband and wife (returning after a few photos on the front lawn), came the toast to the couple. Huntsville Dave would be the speaker, a neighbour of C&amp;C at their cottage. He, like the rest of the ceremony, spoke without a script, and without a clue about what he was going to say before it was said.<br />
(A note on Daves. C&amp;C seem to know a lot of them. Too many, as a matter of fact. So many, that they all have qualifiers, usually denoting where they live: Huntsville, Scarborough, Ainsville, Oakville, and so forth.)<br />
As the speech finished, I quickly ducked inside to take off the jacket to the kilt. Although I would later learn that it is customary to keep your jacket on until the groom removes his, I was wearing something designed for winter conditions. With all due deference to my new brother-in-law, I was dying in that thing.<br />
Shortly after, we gathered the families, and went for the photographs. Cameras were everywhere. We were lucky that it was bright enough that most didn&#8217;t use flashes. I can only imagine the bright spots I would have seen.<br />
While this was going on, the catering staff had opened the bar, and people not taking pictures (or being in them) had started to mingle. Hors d&#8217;oeurves were shortly followed, and quickly eaten. There was laughter, music, food, and drink. No-one, as far as I can tell, had a bad time.<br />
The finger foods soon gave way to more &#8220;formal&#8221; foods: seafood (raw oysters, lox, shrimp), sushi, and roast beef on a bun. Yeah, doesn&#8217;t sound too fancy, but then the food should fit the couple. (I&#8217;m not saying C&amp;C aren&#8217;t fancy, but they&#8217;re not pretentious.) And for the record, I&#8217;ve never had buffet-style roast beef that good before.<br />
After a while, the speeches started. Cathy had hit upon the idea of using an old family gong to get people&#8217;s attention when words were to be said, and people to expect a kiss from the bride and groom. The first few were tame (even with a rather emotional speech from Cathy&#8217;s boss), but they got more interesting as the evening wore on.<br />
The one that really surprised us was Julie&#8217;s husband, Dave. He&#8217;s a great guy, just not usually talkative. We were floored when he got up in front of 90-odd people to extol the virtues of his friends. (We were even more floored with his impassioned interpretation of the Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; later on.)<br />
And somewhere in there, was my speech. But this wasn&#8217;t to C&amp;C, it was on behalf of the family to everyone else. It was thanks for the effort and trouble people had to go through to come, some from as far as Anguilla and Vancouver. (Even Gerry and Sam dropped in for a while, who live in Bermuda. Although they were in the area for other reasons.) When it came time to end my speech, I needed a something interesting, funny, and appropriate. So naturally, I drew a blank.<br />
I think that&#8217;s when Dad stepped in. Before I knew it, this is what I&#8217;d said:<br />
&#8220;And if you should find that something is missing here tonight, please do not hesitate to let us know. We&#8217;ll make sure that you get so drunk that you won&#8217;t remember.&#8221;<br />
Dad had definitely made it to the wedding.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before it was time for the first dance. Craig used to teach dance at Arthur Murray, so we all expected quite a show. Unfortunately, he hadn&#8217;t had a chance to teach Cathy yet. But it was still something out of a fairy tale to watch.<br />
Following the dance, it was time to dance with the parents. I was to fill in for Dad. However, we had a slight change in plans, when Don stepped instead. Don is virtually a surrogate father for Cathy and I &#8212; we&#8217;ve known him that long. I think Cathy was a little concerned that I felt pushed out in favour of Don, but I think there was no better person for the job.<br />
Besides, I can&#8217;t dance.<br />
Admittedly, the rest of the evening gets a little hazy from there. About 11:00 or so, I made the mistake of switching from beer to wine, although I don&#8217;t know why. So come about 2:00am, I was apparently incapable of independent vertical alignment, nor could annunciate baby gibberish, let alone a coherent sentence. And I would pay dearly for it the next morning.<br />
Which began at about 10:00am. We had to get ready for the lunch with family, as many of them would be taking off for home again. This also gave C&amp;C time to unwrap the presents they received the night before.<br />
The barbecue billowed smoke from all the hamburgers, the pot boiled corn, and we ate to our hearts&#8217; content. It was a good day, following a great night. And the hilarity around the presents made it even better.<br />
The single best one, in my opinion, was from the Navis family, an old family friend. They gave C&amp;C a poem, on which was a series of instructions on how to build a fence. Each step corresponded to a numbered envelope, which contained a series of gift certificates representative of that step (e.g. coffee, wood, beer, and dinner). And to top it off, his and her hammers and pint beer mugs.<br />
That night, we sat in the back yard, and listened to the crickets, the wind through the trees, and the complete lack of any semblance of traffic or other noises. As Don, another old family friend remarked, it was the end of an era. His era was the end of comfortable backyards. Mine was different. It was the end of the neighbourhood as I knew it. It would be the last night for me next to the pool. The last meal was Chinese. The last swim had been with my cousin, Jen. It would be the last night I slept in the house that I was raised in.<br />
But no amount of sombreness would diminish the happiness of the previous days&#8217; events. The wedding had been more than Cathy could have dreamed for. She and Craig were now readying for a week at their cottage to spend some much needed time relaxing. We would all be happy with the way things went, and with the way things would go.<br />
Even with the killer hangover that I think I&#8217;ve still got.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my second day here at the CBC head office in Toronto. This is a weird place.<br />
You&#8217;re probably asking: What is Geoff doing at the CBC head office in Toronto? That&#8217;s a question I can&#8217;t answer just yet &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to wait until next Tuesday. (The irony is that this won&#8217;t be posted until after I can say what I&#8217;m doing at the CBC. So I could tell you why I&#8217;m here. But hey, it&#8217;s all about telling a story.)<br />
I came in yesterday, taking the GO Train from Clarkson, in the very west of Mississauga. The trip out was quite pleasant (the joys of express trains), and relaxing &#8230; so I thought. The train arrived smoothly and without urgency. I was expecting a leisurely walk to the CBC building (I was a half hour early). Wrong expectation.<br />
As soon as the doors opened, I was overwhelmed with a panic, similar to that of stampeding animals. I felt the urge to move very quickly, and stay with the herd, er, crowd.<br />
Now I remember why I like living in Calgary &#8212; less pressure.<br />
Wandering down Front Street, I quite quickly found myself at the main doors. Not only was I very early, but I was remarking at how HUGE this place is. The building is the size of a city block, no question. It&#8217;s 10 stories tall, not counting the basements. It&#8217;s so big it has at least four sets of elevators &#8212; probably six or more. They&#8217;re colour-coded so you can find them easily.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you can find anything in this building. King Minos&#8217; labyrinth wasn&#8217;t this confusing. (Nor was the 6th floor of the Math and Computer building at the University of Waterloo, despite its near-legendary lack of structure.)<br />
It&#8217;s a bit of a surreal experience. It&#8217;s a true media outlet. (The only thing the CBC doesn&#8217;t touch is print &#8212; but give them the chance, and I&#8217;d bet they would.) You&#8217;d almost expect to run into one of a large number of semi-famous people (I reserve &#8220;famous&#8221; for those instantly recognizable) roaming the halls.<br />
I have yet to see Peter Mansbridge, though.<br />
It took me most of yesterday to get the gist of how this place works. Luckily for me, Brenda returned this morning to really get things moving. While I have a vague idea of what I need to do, Brenda had a lot of the details I didn&#8217;t.<br />
The building offers some interesting services, aside from the media aspects, of course. There&#8217;s the Glenn Gould Studio, a concert hall cum recording studio; robotic mail delivery; an in-house credit union (almost every employee here is unionized); a very in-depth intranet; a beautiful atrium (big bucks in construction, no doubt) that includes a sushi bar; a museum (or three); and probably a lot of stuff I just haven&#8217;t found yet.<br />
And I&#8217;ve only been here two days. I&#8217;ll be here for a couple of days more, though. Then it&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s wedding, and back home.<br />
Three weeks later, I&#8217;m off on another adventure of a lifetime.<br />
Which I can&#8217;t tell you about.<br />
Yet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was a hot night in Ottawa, following Stuart and Therese&#8217;s wedding. It was only going to get hotter. A lot hotter.<br />
The next day was 1 July, otherwise known as Canada Day. Otherwise known as the single biggest excuse to get horribly drunk and act like an idiot.<br />
Especially if you&#8217;re in Ottawa.<br />
My plans didn&#8217;t involve alcohol, though. They were much more simple: An outing with Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s family to see what could be found in our nation&#8217;s capital.<br />
My day started off, however, with a trip back out to Carp. This was for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Therese&#8217;s parents were holding a brunch / present opening for guests to the wedding.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d left my camera battery charger at the house.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brunch was perfect for the day I was about to face: Bagels, smoked salmon, and cream cheese (although I didn&#8217;t have any of that &#8212; cream cheese and I don&#8217;t get along for some reason). I took almost as many pictures of Therese and Stuart opening gifts as I had taken the day before. (The joys of copious amounts of storage in my camera.)<br />
Brunch ended fairly early, many people looking to driving back to whereever it was they came from, and others looking towards doing something for the rest of the day. For me, it was a return to Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s and prepare for the rest of the day&#8217;s events roaming around downtown Ottawa.<br />
By the time I got back to the house, the temperature was already well into the 30s, and showed little sign of slowing down. From all the reports I heard on the radio, this was going to be a VERY hot day. (The next day, the radio joked that the temperature had gone to 216 degrees, or 36 without the humidex. In either case, it was just an inhumane (and generally unfriendly to animals, too) temperature for people to be out doing anything strenuous, which was exactly what about 300,000+ people were doing in the downtown/Hull area.)<br />
We parked in a lot to the southwest of Parliment Hill, from which we hoped to be able to make a quick escape after the fireworks were over. (Hey, you can at least hope.) And with that, we jumped from the air-conditioned truck into the sweltering heat of Canada Day.<br />
Wandering, albeit a little more slowly, we eventually found our way down to Wellington/Rideau, which had been cordoned off for pedestrian use. It was almost 2pm, and the larger shows wouldn&#8217;t start for a few hours, but already the streets were lined with revellers. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen so much red and white in my life.<br />
And that was just the pastey white folk with the sunburns.<br />
We made it down about as far as the Chateau Laurier when we ran into the first major busker, who was going to attempt a rope walk on a portable rope-walking apparatus. The guy&#8217;s show was nearly completely based on the lead-up. The actual rope walk was completely anti-climactic, but a good showman will always leave people entertained. Barely into his show, he was tapped on the shoulder by a woman who asked him (he had a loudspeaker) to ask if there was a doctor in the audience &#8212; a young girl had passed out in the heat.<br />
Yes, it was that hot. I guess I needn&#8217;t mention the thick layer of sunscreen protecting us (most of us, anyway, Stefan doesn&#8217;t like the stuff).<br />
Now quite damp from the steady stream of sweat (and the show over), we started hunting around for the next great thing to see. As it happens, we passed the Photography Gallery (adjacent to the Chateau Laurier). At first, we weren&#8217;t going to go in, but the guard had quite the draw:<br />
&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen! Please take advantage of your nation&#8217;s free and *air-conditioned* museums this Canada Day!&#8221;<br />
The museum was small, pretty empty on the upper level, but much cooler. We took our time before running back outside.<br />
We headed into Majors Hill Park to see what interesting things could be found. The first was a welcome relief to everyone suffering in the great outdoor furnace: a Spray Zone. This is nothing fancy, no more than a hose hooked into the city water supply and bent into a two metre arch. Anyone walking under the spray got quite wet &#8212; which was perfect for us. We nearly took permanent refuge under there.<br />
Barely into the park, Rebecca pretty much insisted that I get some water before I started keeling over from dehydration and sunstroke. Unable to drink from the two camelback water pouches they brought (although offered, I declined due to nursing a mild cold), I purchased a pair of bottles from a vendor. There weren&#8217;t too expensive, and would keep me relatively well hydrated for the day.<br />
Eric took the opportunity to refill his now nearly empty water gun with the ice-cold water. Eric had probably brought it along as a joke, trying to annoy everyone else. However, it kind of backfired on him when we continually asked him to hose us down so we could try and keep cool. Although it was a fair bit of fun when Stefan managed to periodically steal the pistol and turn the tables on the lad.<br />
But Eric wasn&#8217;t the only one with a water gun. Shortly after one of the various busker shows, we walked into the cross-fire of a man slinging what can only be described as a water bazooka. I think the stream was about an inch in diametre. Rebecca got shot square in the face, but didn&#8217;t seem to mind one bit.<br />
The park area was filled with various little booths and shows (including an extreme sports aerial demonstration), and lots of people. Onward we trudged, watching the various buskers (none of whom were particularly interesting), before finding ourselves getting on a shuttle bus for Hull.<br />
The &#8220;National Captial Region&#8221; is not just the Ontario side. It includes Hull as well, so naturally, there were events on the other side. Of particular importance was the children&#8217;s area, complete with play areas, air-filled bounce rooms, and L&#8217;Ecole du Cirque, who set up a pair of trampolines, a pair of trapezes, and some other circus-related equipment so children of all ages could enjoy themselves.<br />
In the oppressive heat.<br />
Eric and Thea (Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s kids) made full use of the facilities, as did Stefan when he tried to ride a unicycle. He wasn&#8217;t horribly successful, but did learn that it made for a great upper thigh exercise trying to stay balanced.<br />
After the kids had run the course of the circus, we started heading back. Or rather, we would have were it not for curiousity, which drew us over to the Museum of Civilization. As nothing was immediately visible, we headed back over the bridge (sans autobus) to the Ottawa side. We took our time over the middle, as the breeze there was cooling enough to make the trip bearable.<br />
As we started to cross the bridge, Eric announced, to our partial dismay, that the water gun was broken. The pump used to pressurize the vessel had apparently blown a seal. Had Stefan a screwdriver, it would have been fixed in a jiffy. But with only his wits and a pocket of keys, cracking the gun open for repairs was outside of his ability. We would be waterless for the rest of the day.<br />
Once reaching the other side, we found that the pathway down to the Rideau Canal and locks was blocked off for &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. Probably meant they didn&#8217;t want to worry about some yutz getting too close to the fireworks. Within a few steps, however, the heat had become unbearable. We needed to cool off.<br />
Despite objections from the kids, we ducked into the National Art Gallery. Almost instantly, we felt our sanity returning as the cool air slowly stripped away the veneer of heat-spawned exhaustion. It took nearly 45 minutes before we were ready to brave the great outdoors again. Our brave, energized burst outdoors came to a slow crawl within five metres of the door, as the oven-like air burned off our veneer of cool-enduced enthusiasm<br />
We wandered back through Majors Hill Park and climbed the stairs back to Wellington St. The stairwell was completely covered in chalk drawings from someone who had left large pieces of street chalk all over the place. Thea grabbed a piece, and from the Chateau Laurier, across Wellington, down the stairs at the NAC, down the sidewalk next to the Canal, and all the way into Confederation Park, Thea would walk about five feet, stoop down and draw a happy face.<br />
Had I not managed to sort out my differences with the RCMP and CSIS earlier in the day, I would have been an easy person to follow.<br />
Confederation Park was the location of interesting food &#8230; well, more interesting than the plethora of hotdogs and sausages available about every 10 metres along most of the roads. Here was Egyptian, Japanese (sorry, but as much as I love sushi, there are things I will not touch in that heat), Indian, and something else I can&#8217;t remember now. I ended up having (rather spicy) butter chicken and a samosa (love those things). I almost got lucky and had myself dunked in ice-cold water when the clerk at the counter emptied out their pop bucket. Had I been actually thinking, I would have shoved my head under the stream &#8230; all I got was my foot.<br />
We sat in the shade of a large tree and tried to relax. Even with a setting sun, the heat was still intense. We opted to wait for Reggae Cowboys to start, hoping that they&#8217;d be at least somewhat entertaining. (They were at best tolerable.) The real stars of the stage were Samba Ottawa, a band what would be quite at home at Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Despite being almost entirely white folk, they played a mean beat that had everyone tapping something. Admittedly, though, I ended up watching a young woman (early 20s, I imagine), who had curves like an hourglass and rhythm that could kill. The fact that she was uber-cute certainly added to the appeal. For a short time, I forgot how hot it was.<br />
I dunno what it is about people of Spanish or Portugese decent, but they really know how to mambo&#8230;<br />
Extracating ourselves from the park around 8:15, we found our way to Parliment Hill, and forced our way into the crowd. Stefan and I held back a bit while Rebecca and the kids moved ahead into a small clear spot. But we could all see just fine.<br />
The show was basically four bands: The Arrogant Worms (who did double duty as emcees), two French bands, and David Usher (formerly of Moist). The Worms played their songs in between the sets of the other bands, including their biggest pro-national hits, &#8220;Rocks and Trees&#8221; (really quite humourous in a large crowd setting), and &#8220;Canada&#8217;s Really Big&#8221;.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what it is with French bands, but they always seem to have guys who look as old as the Rolling Stones, or play the same song five times over. Okay, maybe I can&#8217;t hear French language as well as I should (damn the public school system!), but even musically it&#8217;s not too hard to VARY A NOTE OR TWO. And the singer in one band made Leonard Cohen look like a vocal genius.<br />
And I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of David Usher. I&#8217;ve heard his songs, they&#8217;re okay, but they really don&#8217;t rock my boat. But hey, it&#8217;s a free live show, and I wasn&#8217;t about to complain. And admittedly, he put on a good show. And I do have to say, he knows how to end it.<br />
The last song of the night was announced this way:<br />
&#8220;Wow! You&#8217;re a great audience! [Crowd cheers loudly.] But every good party needs a little Ozzy!&#8221;<br />
Yes, Ozzy as in Ozzy Osbourne. Sure enough, his band started playing the beginning to &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Ozzy, either. I like a couple of his songs, but I&#8217;ll be unable to name &#8217;em. Usher managed to mix the music scores from two Ozzy songs, and then overlaid different lyrics, specifically &#8220;Get This Party Started&#8221; by Pink.<br />
Sounds weird, I know, but wouldn&#8217;t ya know it &#8212; they go together really well. (Expect it on Dave&#8217;s next album.)<br />
Following that were the ubiquitous fireworks, a requirement of every Canada Day celebration. Had we been on the Quebec side of the river, I suspect the fireworks would have been amazing. On the south side of the Parliment Buildings, however, they ain&#8217;t so hot &#8212; we could only really see the high ones.<br />
Fireworks over, the five of us stalled a bit while the rest of the crowd of probably 500,000+ filtered out into the night. We took our time, found a stall with sausages (we were pretty hungry), and eventually found the car. Getting out of the downtown, however, was another story.<br />
Traffic, as one might expect, as a disaster. The police had blocked off certain roads that Stefan wanted to take so we could make a quick escape. This, suffice to say, frustrated him immensely. But it ended up directing us over to Marnie&#8217;s apartment (a friend of Stefan and Rebecca) who accompanied us on our trip back to Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s house. There we took refuge in the cool basement to relax a little.<br />
The next morning, following a quick visit to the National Museum of Science and Technology (I wanted to get pictures of the locomotives they have there), I braved the trip back to Toronto, at fairly high speed. I wasn&#8217;t keen on getting caught in traffic.<br />
It was hot.<br />
Really hot.<br />
And to top it all off, I got a sunburn.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in your life when things start getting a lot more adult than you&#8217;re normally used to. For me, it was when my friends started getting married. But I didn&#8217;t really start getting self-conscious about it until this past weekend.<br />
On 30 June 2002, I had the honour of attending the wedding of two of my closest and dearest friends, Stuart and Therese. (They were marrying each other. Added bonus: I only had to buy one gift.)<br />
Although Therese and Stuart currently live in Calgary, the majority of their family lives in Ontario. The entire affair was held at Therese&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house in Carp, about a 25 km drive from downtown Ottawa. It would mean, for me, a trip back east, back to Ottawa for (another) summer wedding, and a chance to meet with old friends.<br />
I flew out on the 28th, flying to Hamilton via WestJet. (I&#8217;ve formally sworn off Tango &#8212; they might have cheaper fares than WestJet, but their total lack of service is enough to keep me going to WestJet. And I ain&#8217;t the only one.) Arriving late, I had to catch a cab to my mom&#8217;s house in Oakville. It&#8217;s not exactly a cheap cab ride.<br />
But stay in Oakville I didn&#8217;t &#8212; the next morning, after rising, showering, and running a couple of errands, I headed out to Ottawa. It had been five and a half years since I drove to Ottawa, and I was actually looking forward to the trip. (Or I would have, if the stupid tape deck in the car had accepted the cassette adapter so I could play my MiniDisc through the radio.) But all in all, it could have been worse &#8230; the radio could have been broken.<br />
I left Oakville almost an hour and a half late. And I paid for that delay, too. Although I shot down the QEW, the Gardner Expressway, and up the DVP without trouble, I had forgotten the cardinal rule of long weekends in Southern Ontario:<br />
Leave early, or sit in traffic.<br />
I got partway into Scarborough when my blunder came to fruition. Hard traffic. Really hard. And it lasted all the way out to Whitby. A drive that would normally take about 30 minutes took well over two hours.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take much to remind me of the reasons I no longer like Southern Ontario, especially in the summer. Topmost on my list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Traffic (especially rush hour or long weekend)</li>
<li>Heat (especially when combined with humidity)</li>
<li>Smell (especially when stuck in traffic when it&#8217;s really hot)</li>
</ol>
<p>Traffic didn&#8217;t really clear up until almost Kingston. Needless to say, I found out that Dad&#8217;s Chevy Cavalier can do 130 km/h without difficulty at all.<br />
Not having driven in Ottawa since about 1996, I had never taken the 416 before. This was a vast improvement on the old Highway 16, which was a deathtrap in winter, and just took too long the rest of the time. My speed barely slowing, I found myself in Ottawa in about the same amount of time it would have taken me on Highway 7, and without hitting traffic.<br />
Unlike the majority of others, I would not check into a hotel during my stay. Instead, I was invited to stay with my friends Stefan and Rebecca. As I would not be hanging out with Stuart and Therese the entire time, this was a chance for me to catch up with them, and hopefully have some fun.<br />
I soon found that my memory of their house&#8217;s location was a little off, and I ended up having to call for directions. Fortunately, I wasn&#8217;t too far off, so it only took a couple of minutes to show up. (Now I know exactly where the house is.)<br />
Rebecca was there (Stefan was off getting supplies to begin home renovations), so we chatted a while before everyone else came home. Deciding that the sticky heat of an early Ottawa summer was not exactly comfortable, we decided that maybe air-conditioned entertainment was more appropriate. It was movie time&#8230;<br />
Ottawa, like many other cities in Canada, is suffering from movie theatre overload. Theatres that were considered luxurious only a few years ago are now waning, becoming second-run &#8220;cheapie&#8221; theatres. (Oakville doesn&#8217;t even have a Famous Players or Cineplex anymore &#8212; only AMC exists in town, and only on the very east end.) The theatre we were in will be a cheapie in the next six months, we guessed.<br />
Although Minority Report is an excellent film, the lack of air conditioning in the theatre didn&#8217;t make the movie any better. In fact, we couldn&#8217;t wait to get out of the movie so we could cool down after a while. I just made a point of not moving during the 2.5+ hour show.<br />
The movie over, Rebecca, Stefan, and I opted to retreat to the relative wildness of the Bytown Market, the favoured hangout of the young and reckless. During the school year, this is where you can find the majority of post-secondary students in the National Capital Region. During the summer &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t really know where they all come from, but there&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em.<br />
We wandered around, trying to find a place that had nice margaritas and not too long a lineup. It took us a while, but eventually we found the right place. But by then, it was nearly closing time. So we downed what we had, and made way for home.<br />
The next day was the Big Day. But it wouldn&#8217;t start for me until 3:30 that afternoon. We started the morning with breakfast at a nearby restaurant. Then it was a leisurely return home, a long shower, and a very careful dressing. (Although I had to borrow one of Stefan&#8217;s undershirts to prevent nasty perspiration stains from finding their way to my shirt.)<br />
Did I mention that it was borderline insanely hot?<br />
Ottawa, like Southern Ontario, gets very warm in the summer. The temperature was in the low 30s, which in itself is quite warm. However, on top of that is the humidity, which cranks the perceived temperature to something like 45. (This is all Celsius, by the way.)<br />
The trip out to Carp was a relatively easy one, even though I hadn&#8217;t been there for at least six years &#8212; probably longer. Luckily, I remembered something about the Crazy Horse Saloon, which marked where I had to turn. After that, it was just a matter of finding the right house. It wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; there was only one wedding on the street that day.<br />
The Holton household was a flurry of activity, and I was one of the first to show. (Actually, I was asked by Therese and Stuart to arrive a little early. I had certain duties they wanted me to fulfill.) Therese was not quite at the panic stage yet, and seemed to be handling everything very well. Mrs. Holton seemed quite well off, as did Mr. Holton. Danica (Therese&#8217;s sister) was completely at ease. Stuart, who was roaming about, seemed a little nervous, but had planned everything out so well that he seemed barely fazed by the whole event to come.<br />
Before long, the guests started appearing in droves. Some people, such as Stuart&#8217;s parents, I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. Others, such as Jay, Matt, and Nabil, I had seen more recently, coincidentally at another wedding (Jay&#8217;s, to be specific). Then there were people from Guelph (where Therese when to university) that I hadn&#8217;t seen in almost six years. And then&#8230; well, the list is fairly lengthy. Suffice to say, it was good to see all.<br />
I took my place in the front row of the guest seats, where I could get a good view of the ceremony. Stuart and Therese trusted me to take some of the key photos (I really hope they turn out), so I had to be in a place where I could see them. I also had to cue the music at the right times, and still try to look like I was just a guest. Juggling two cameras ain&#8217;t easy, especially when you don&#8217;t have the luxury of telling people not to move.<br />
The sound of bagpipes soon wafted through the trees and under the tents &#8212; Stuart walked through the garden path, up the aisle, and to his place on the deck. After a few moments, the tune changed (and no, not to &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; &#8212; although that would have been rather interesting on the bagpipes), and Therese walked her way up to take her place next to Stuart.<br />
Then came the moment that 10 years ago I dreaded, that for the last four years have been expecting, and for the last six months, had truly hoped would be their happiest day. The ceremony began.<br />
Stuart was dressed in his fine kilt (his family is Scottish), but donned a lavender-blue button-down shirt with a matching silk tie. Therese&#8217;s dress was a matte silver silk with spaghetti string straps. Her hair was up (a rarity for her), with a small tiara to tie it all together. Although the tiara had been a bit of a joke when she first acquired it, when Therese walked up onto the deck, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of Audrey Hepburn in &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8221;. It had been a very long time since the last time, but I was envious of Stuart.<br />
The feeling passed quickly, though, and I was swept into the affair. It was simple, quiet, and exactly what I&#8217;d expect from Therese and Stuart &#8212; complete with a bit of humour when Therese stumbled across one of her lines, and teary when Therese had trouble getting another out through her half-sobs of joy. This was truly a happy day.<br />
The ceremony was short, but sweeter than the most luxurious sugar. Okay, yeah, that sounds cheesy, but you gotta understand &#8212; this is the first wedding I actually cried at. Until then, I didn&#8217;t really get the joke: &#8220;I always cry at weddings.&#8221;<br />
The vows were exchanged, as were rings, and before we knew it, came the kiss. I was so overwhelmed with everything that I almost forgot the music cue.<br />
Therese and Stuart adjourned to a small table to sign away their lives, so to speak. Pictures were taken in spades. The Music Gods smiled on Stuart and Therese that day &#8212; the first song in the queue (Tom Petty&#8217;s &#8220;Wildflowers&#8221; finished just as they returned to centre stage, to be pronounced (offically) husband and wife. As they left, I skipped to the fifth song, the one they wanted to play as they finished and left the stage, The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;All You Need Is Love&#8221;.<br />
The crowd moved to the front yard, where the majority of the &#8220;formal&#8221; photographs were taken. There was no professional photographer, Therese and Stuart were relying on the rest of us shutterbugs to get the photographs. I was entrusted a little further with Stuart&#8217;s manual camera (which, thankfully, he&#8217;d already preset for use) &#8212; I only pray that the pictures I took meet with his approval.<br />
Pictures wrapped up, the party slowly began as people started to filter over to the tent again (a group of us had moved the chairs around and put up tables during the picture session &#8212; I was supposed to coordinate it, but I got caught up in the photos). Drinks came out (well, they&#8217;d been out for a while, but they came out a bit faster now), and people started mingling.<br />
While people mingled, we had one problem to solve. In all our haste, we had forgotten the head table. There wasn&#8217;t one. But luckily, there were enough people to solve the problem &#8212; two small tables could seat eight, and suddenly everyone was happy again.<br />
By the time table started in to get their meals, we had to start lighting the citronella lamps to try and cut down on the armada of mosquitos that were started to thin out the available blood supply.<br />
Dinner was wonderfully simple: Salads, poached salmon, and a hot buffet that included roast beef. It successfully covered everyone&#8217;s tastes and desires &#8230; especially those of us who love a variety.<br />
Dinner completed, people began to mingle again. Slowly at first, some moving into the house to escape the invasion of airborne bloodsuckers, others taking their leave and heading home (or to their respective hotels). Dancing was informal, and not really long-lived. Although the constant movement kept the mosquitos at bay a little better, not everyone was completely comfortable in the unbearable heat. (Even afer the sun went down, it was still quite warm.)<br />
People began to dissipate like steam from a kettle over the next couple of hours. I was one of the last to leave. I returned to my car, and headed back towards Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s.<br />
As I drove in the cool(er) silence of the night, I thought about the day&#8217;s proceedings. Yes, things had changed. Stuart and Therese were no longer just friends, or partners, or significant others. They, like many of my friends, were now married. Life was again moving forward, in its inexorable march forward. And while I was so happy that their wedding had been a joyous one, there was that slightly ominous undertone of the finality of life, that this is an event that I will witness but once.<br />
But that&#8217;s why I take pictures, so I can relive the moment any time I want. And it&#8217;s why I write these journals, so I can also remember my thoughts and feelings.<br />
Congratulations, my dear friends. May your marriage bring you joy, prosperity, and the sound of little feet.<br />
And I ain&#8217;t referring to your cats.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yeah, I know, the holidays are over, why the heck am I writing about it now? Simple: I got away from computers for two weeks, and haven&#8217;t had the time to write until now.<br />
Unlike last year, I spent roughly half my time here in Calgary, and the other half in Toronto. Why didn&#8217;t I just make up my mind and do one or the other? Well, I suppose I could have, but the cost of flying to Toronto for the entire time was pretty steep (go figure), and I did want to go home for a while. But because every time I go back to Ontario, I remember why I live here, I didn&#8217;t want to stick around too long.<br />
No, I don&#8217;t hate my family or friends. I don&#8217;t know what it is. I just feel &#8230; weird whenever I&#8217;m in southern Ontario. Maybe it&#8217;s the never-ending city that gets to me, I dunno.<br />
At any rate, I made the trip to Toronto *very* early on the 23rd. Originally, I was supposed to leave at 6:30 on the morning of the 23rd. However, Air Canada Tango cancelled that flight and bumped me back to 12:53am. Oh yay. How I love red-eye flights.<br />
Yes, I flew Tango. First off, it&#8217;s meant to be a low-budget airline killer. (Canada 3000&#8217;s already gone under, I suspect Air Transat might have trouble in the near future, but the real fight will come when Tango tries to dive into WestJet country.) As such, it&#8217;s as no-frills as it gets. Even the chairs show it &#8212; they&#8217;re grey, and don&#8217;t even have those fancy flaps of fabric on the headrests. Even the ubiquitous peanuts (now pretzels) cost $1.<br />
And boy, are the staff surly at one in the morning! I was amazed at the curtness of the flight attendants. Just because you got stuck with a bad shift doesn&#8217;t mean you take it out on the passengers. Welcome to the travel industry, crap happens! And the Head Flight Attendant must&#8217;ve smuggled her bong onboard &#8230; the number of times she stopped talking in mid-sentence for upwards of 30 seconds before resuming was astounding.<br />
Luckily, I slept the whole flight.<br />
Arriving at 6:30am EST was a joy. I hate Pearson International enough as it is &#8212; the parking is insane, the baggage system has to be the slowest in Canada (even despite the size), and usually by the time I get there I just want to get out of the airport, so I&#8217;m generally cranky anyway. Cathy was going insane trying to figure out where I was &#8212; the flight was a little late, and bags took nearly 30 minutes to come out &#8212; but finally we were off to Oakville.<br />
Neither of my parents knew I was coming in so early. They were expecting noon. However, in the interests of their sanity, I hadn&#8217;t mentioned that my flight had been rescheduled. (Next time, though, I&#8217;m not telling anyone the flight time, and I&#8217;m taking a cab.) While waiting for mom and dad to rise, I started making breakfast.<br />
And nearly burned the potatoes. Not my best outing, unfortunately.<br />
The 23rd was generally slow day. A little bit of running around, some decorating (the tree was not yet ready), and lots of chatting. The only thing that would have made it better was if it had snowed.<br />
On the 24th, we had lunch with my aunt (my father&#8217;s sister) and cousins Erica and Lauren. I hadn&#8217;t seen either of them in quite a while, and we had a ball listening to Erica&#8217;s traditional Christmas banter. Sometimes I swear Erica should be a comedienne, or at least give amateur mike night a shot &#8212; she&#8217;s certainly got the wit for it.<br />
Christmas Eve was the traditional roast ham and scalloped potatoes. For me, Christmas eve just isn&#8217;t right without them. It was also a late night for us &#8212; Craig, dad, and I were all up until almost 2:00 Christmas morning. It was going to be the start of a very long day.<br />
Christmas morning started a little early, around 9:00 or so. Coffee and Baileys (for those who drank it, I still avoid coffee) were the order of the moment. Given the hullabaloo to take place that evening, it was probably best that most of the family started to tranquilize early in the day. (Coffee and Baileys would give way to Caesars later in the morning.)<br />
Before breakfast, we gathered in the living room to open presents. In yet another tradition that seemed to have no specific beginning, I played Santa, and handed out presents around the room. It was interesting to watch people open presents when I had none. Being out-of-province, I was fortunate in not receiving much of anything (which believe it or not, I&#8217;m quite happy about).<br />
All in all, I received three gifts. The first was my grandfather&#8217;s pocket watch. I never met either of my biological grandfathers (I did have a maternal step-grandfather for many years) &#8212; they both died before I was born. My paternal grandfather died when my father was 18, and it was his watch I received. It&#8217;s a grand old piece, which my grandfather received from his parents when he was 21. We found this out by accident, when I unscrewed the back plate to find an inscription my father didn&#8217;t know was there.<br />
My second gift was a snowboard. Apparently someone had been listening a little to close to my interest in TRYING snowboarding. (I have to emphasis &#8220;trying&#8221; because someone equated it with &#8220;wanting to take up&#8221; instead of &#8220;seeing if it won&#8217;t kill me first&#8221;.) So, yes, sometime soon you can expect a lovely little tale about me breaking my tail trying to get down a mountain.<br />
The third was probably the most special of all: I got a brother-in-law-to-be.<br />
Cathy and Craig have been together for about five years (I don&#8217;t know exactly how long). They&#8217;re about as perfect a couple as you can have &#8212; after five years, they still sound like they&#8217;ve only been dating for a week. (It&#8217;s actually sickening sometimes.) Cathy has been after Craig for marriage for about a year, after Julie (an old family friend, and Cathy&#8217;s best friend) got hitched in December 2000. Craig waited until the right moment.<br />
As I handed out gifts, I picked up three identically-wrapped, but different-sized, boxes. One was obviously a ring case, one was about the size of a large brick, the largest the size of a shoe box. None were labelled, but Craig indicated they were for Cathy.<br />
My sister lunged at the ring box. Instead of a ring, however, she found a note that read: &#8220;Birks was sold out of everything, and all I could get was this box.&#8221;<br />
Cathy, fortunately, has a very good sense of humour.<br />
She opened the largest one next. Under the wrapping paper was, in fact, a shoebox, upon which Craig wrote &#8220;This is not a sweatshirt, this is a remote control&#8221;. (The running joke the night before was that Craig was getting Cathy a remote control for Christmas.) Inside was a sweatshirt.<br />
On to present #3. This was an electric toothbrush, something Cathy wanted for a while, so I gathered. But wedged inside the styrofoam packing was a slender silver ring. I don&#8217;t think I even heard Cathy say &#8220;yes&#8221;.<br />
A note on that ring, by the way. It&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s mother&#8217;s original engagement ring &#8230; with a couple modifications. (After my grandfather died, someone (we don&#8217;t know who) turned the ring into a dinner ring.) But with a resetting, the ring will be Cathy&#8217;s.<br />
Following our rather emotional moments by the fire, we ate breakfast (my father&#8217;s secret recipe for pancakes) and started to prepare for dinner. We were having a lot of people over, and it was going to take a while to get all the food ready. It was going to be a dinner to remember.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t remember the last time the entire Robinson family had come to my family&#8217;s home for Christmas dinner, but I&#8217;m willing to take a bet on about five years. It&#8217;s certainly been at least that long since we were all together at the same time, only now both Mark and Julie are both married (their spouses were also in attendance). In fact, it was the first time the Sowrey family was outnumbered at its own table. Also there was another relative, Brian Hogg. (The Hoggs are a couple branches over from the Sowreys, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly where or how.)<br />
Dinner began shortly after 4:00pm, when guests started arriving. Dinner was still being prepared (when you make a full roast turkey and a full roast beef dinner, you need two kitchens), which gave everyone else a chance to catch up with one another. We wouldn&#8217;t eat until about 7:00. And eat we did&#8230;<br />
A few helpings, lots of dessert, and perhaps a little too much to drink, and we were already to start playing games. Specifically, a game called Outburst, where the point is to try and guess all the items on a Top 10 list. It&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds. Even with topics we knew well, we never once got all 10 items.<br />
Dinner ended around 4:00am. I didn&#8217;t make it that long &#8212; I went to bed somewhere around 1am, as I knew I had to be up reasonably early (before 10am).<br />
On Boxing Day, I braved the trip into Toronto (via Go Train, what else?) to visit an old friend of mine, Mikki. She&#8217;s an old friend of mine from university who&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve been promising to visit with for ages, and it was high-time I did as I said. (I know, there&#8217;s about 20 of you who I should also visit with, some of whom have been a very long time, but I&#8217;d need at least a week for all that.) As it stands, I was supposed to meet with Dave on the following day, but I screwed up my schedules and had to cancel on him literally at the last minute.<br />
Walking in downtown Toronto, I came to realize why it is that 1) I don&#8217;t go shopping on Boxing Day, and 2) Why I try to avoid walking in downtown Toronto. I won&#8217;t even begin to describe the claustrophobia that seemed to set in when I saw the chaos in Eaton Centre.<br />
Before I knew it, I found myself at Pearson International again, waiting for my flight to Calgary. Like the flight out, this would be wall-to-wall people.<br />
It was good to be back in Calgary. Even better to be back in my apartment. Home truly is where the 50&#8243; TV and Playstation2 are.<br />
The rest of the vacation went well until Sunday, when a bad bit of Chinese took me down for a couple of days. I hadn&#8217;t had food poisoning in many years, so whatever it was that took me down was pretty strong. I&#8217;m still recovering. One advantage of it, though&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m losing all that weight I gained over the holidays.<br />
Happy 2002, everyone! Speaking of which&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, I had meant to write this earlier this week, but after what happened on Tuesday, I hope you can understand why there&#8217;s a delay.<br />
Most of you probably don&#8217;t know that I went back to Toronto on the weekend. It was a little longer than the whip-in/whip-out trips I usually do for such things &#8212; normally I fly out Friday evenings and fly back Sunday evenings, but I took two extra days this time. Work has been stressful, and this was a more special event than normal, so I wanted to take my time.<br />
The event was the wedding of perhaps my oldest friend, Mark Robinson. How old? Well, let me put it to you this way &#8212; many people can remember, at least vaguely, when they first met someone. I don&#8217;t remember when I met the Robinsons. Our parents met about 30 years ago. My mother and Mrs. Robinson are best of friends (we&#8217;ve often joked about putting in a dedicated phone between the two houses). We used to have Christmas and New Years dinners together. It&#8217;s a long, sordid history.<br />
Mark, his sister Julie, my sister Cathy, myself, and two other neighbourhood kids, AJ and Kelly, made up the neighbourhood mob. We played baseball (with tennis balls), swam, help mini-Olympics, and generally raised a ruckus around the blocks. Mark was generally the ringleader, being the oldest of us &#8212; me being just shy of two years younger.<br />
When Mark was enrolled in Appleby College in Grade 4 or 5 (can&#8217;t remember which), we started seeing less of him. When Grade 9 rolled around, he stayed at Appleby nearly all the time (it was a requirement). Then came university, and I saw less of almost everyone. Over the years, separation was inevitable.<br />
Cathy, on the other hand, stuck to the Robinsons like glue &#8212; Julie still being one of Cathy&#8217;s best friends. As a result, Cathy got to know Mark&#8217;s friends from Appleby and university. (The keg parties were talk of legend after a while.)<br />
When news of Mark&#8217;s engagement came around last December, I felt like I&#8217;d missed something. About 15 years, to be exact. Once upon a time, I&#8217;d looked up to Mark &#8212; he was my role model as a child. He was strong, brave, and a natural leader. Sure, we had our disagreements (most friends do), but overall I still admired him. News of the engagement drew pangs of regret &#8212; I&#8217;d stayed away so long, I&#8217;d missed watching one of my friends grow up. I barely knew the person I had once aspired to be. I didn&#8217;t even know his fiancÃ©e, Darla.<br />
So needless to say, I was quite happy to hear I would be invited to the wedding. I had missed Julie&#8217;s wedding (I couldn&#8217;t afford the flight to Antigua from Calgary at the time), but I wasn&#8217;t about to miss another Robinson wedding. So I booked a flight (a bit more expensive than I would have liked, admittedly) and whisked myself back to Ontario.<br />
I left Friday morning. That morning, it was 3 degrees Celsius in Calgary. It would be 29 degrees when I landed in Toronto. Choosing an appropriate set of clothes to handle the change in weather was mildly difficult &#8212; I froze in Calgary, and boiled in Oakville.<br />
The wedding was on the Saturday, and would be the first one I&#8217;d been to that started in late afternoon (4:30). It was a little odd, because it meant I was idle for most of the morning. So naturally, there was a massive rush around 3:50 to get everyone together and out the door so we could make it on time. As Appleby College is in Oakville, it was a quick trip over.<br />
The ceremony was in Appleby&#8217;s chapel, an old ivy-covered building designed in the traditional British school chapel style, with pews running perpendicular to the altar, rather than parallel. It was also traditional in that it had no air conditioning. Although my new suit is much lighter than my previous ones, it was still very warm. Most people were sweating profusely (I can only imagine what Mark and Darla must&#8217;ve felt like).<br />
It was a large affair &#8212; about 150 people (that&#8217;s a complete guesstimate, I have no idea really how many people showed up). The wedding party had four people apiece. Family was everywhere.<br />
Being an Anglican ceremony, it was quick. A few quick words, the odd speech, and in 15 minutes, we were back outside. Although still 30-odd degrees, it was cooler than inside, and had a breeze. We stood around, took lots of pictures of the newlyweds, before heading off back home for a quick stop.<br />
Then it was off to downtown Toronto, and the reception at the University of Toronto&#8217;s Hart House. Hart House (just west of Queen&#8217;s Park) is one of UofT&#8217;s oldest buildings, constructed in the late 19th century. It&#8217;s built in the London gothic style, and provided an unbelievable backdrop for the wedding. Mark and Darla had provided for their guests lavishly &#8212; oysters on the half-shell, smoked salmon, and an open bar with nearly unlimited supplies of excellent red and white Henry of Pelham wines. (Two of their wedding party &#8212; a married couple &#8212; run the vinery.)<br />
And that was just the pre-reception. Dinner was yet to follow.<br />
After another round of pictures in the Hart House courtyard, we moved indoors to the grand Great Hall for dinner. I was seated with my parents, the Robinson&#8217;s, and their relatives (not all of them, anyway), right in front of the head table. Mr. Robinson gave his speech in typically Mr. Robinson style (a combination of dry wit, bad jokes, and the odd bout of seriousness), followed by speeches by the best man (Brent) and maid of honour (Darla&#8217;s sister, Jillian).<br />
Then dinner was served.<br />
Wow.<br />
I can&#8217;t really think of anything else to say, but &#8220;wow&#8221;. It was an amazing meal &#8212; Mark and Darla, unfortunately, had a reputation to uphold (started with Mark&#8217;s keg parties), and they had to deliver. They did so in exceptional style and taste:<br />
The appetizer was roasted butternut squash soup with fresh rosemary with a dollop of low fat maple yogurt. It was followed by baby spinach leaves with toasted pecans, strawberries, and crumbled Stilton cheese with an apple-Dijon dressing. Eyaa. The entree were medallions of beef tenderloin (the &#8220;medallions&#8221; were huge &#8212; the size of coffee cups) with roasted shallots in a port reduction. Yowza. Dessert was fresh fruit with a warm triple sec sabayon and a crisp wafer. Topped off with a small glass of Late Harvest Vidal dessert wine.<br />
My tastebuds were in Heaven.<br />
I was one of few who actually ate everything. Most people couldn&#8217;t pack it all back. Their loss &#8212; the dinner was outstanding. Although it did take a while to digest.<br />
Mark and Darla seemed to hardly eat. They spent a good chunk of time visiting the tables, seeing the people they invited, and being the quintessential hosts. They made brief trips back to the table for bites of food, but spent most of the their time walking around. Their only other interruptions were for kisses.<br />
Goofy tradition, that kissing thing. Never understood that. But things were different here. No tinking of glasses. This round involved answering trivia questions, kept in balloons that had to be popped before a question could be answered. (I presume this was to prevent people from looking at a question and then backing off if they didn&#8217;t know the answer &#8212; the popping balloon put the people at centre stage.) I was impressed with myself &#8212; I actually knew most of the questions about Mark. I felt a little relieved that I hadn&#8217;t drifted so far away.<br />
After dinner, it was time for Mark&#8217;s speech. (He spoke for Darla as well &#8212; I guess she didn&#8217;t want to make a speech herself.) It started off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m married &#8230; and she&#8217;s <em>hot</em>!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark&#8217;s speech used humour, history, and few tugs at the heartstrings. (Julie threatened to kill Mark if he ever made her cry like that again.) Suddenly, I didn&#8217;t feel quite so distant.<br />
Dancing would have began after that, but first one little bit of housekeeping had to be taken care of. From the day Mark proposed to Darla, there had been a joke floating around, and Ed (one of the groomsmen) was to be the instrument of delivery. Originally planned for the Recessional during the marriage ceremony, it had been delayed until the end of dinner.<br />
Ed walked over to the dance floor, picked up his guitar, and prepared to play. A few of us knew what he was going to sing. As far as I knew, Darla didn&#8217;t know &#8212; which, I believe, was the point. After a quick tune, he started strumming and singing. A few people picked it up right away, but it wasn&#8217;t really until the chorus that most people, Darla included, realized he was singing Simon and Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Mrs. Robinson&#8221;. He would follow up with a U2 song, but I&#8217;m at a loss to remember which one&#8230;<br />
The First Dance came soon after. People then began to mill around &#8212; some danced, some went outdoors, and few began to trickle out the door to go home. We stuck around until closing time, somehow&#8230;<br />
Perhaps it was the drink, perhaps it was exhaustion, perhaps it was the heat &#8212; I still had trouble looking at Mark and accepting that he was married. (I still have that trouble with Julie, and she&#8217;s been married for 10 months.) It seems that the time from when I entered high school until now has just vanished. I&#8217;ve missed so much, and gained so little.<br />
Hopefully, the next 15 years won&#8217;t go so quickly.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I knew something was up a few months ago, when Chris told me he was going to Ontario for &#8220;a friend&#8217;s wedding&#8221;. Chris is rarely that vague. More often than not, he&#8217;ll include a name, even if it&#8217;s someone I don&#8217;t know.<br />
A month or two later, I got the call. It was Gerry, phoning long distance from Bermuda, with &#8220;big&#8221; news. Seeing as Sam (Gerry&#8217;s girlfriend) had given birth to their son Alex on March 2nd, it was doubtful the news was &#8220;Sam&#8217;s pregnant&#8221;. This was something different &#8230; they were getting married.<br />
The early secrecy was because Gerry wasn&#8217;t sure of who was going to be invited, and who wasn&#8217;t. Not wanting to hurt feelings, no-one was originally to know, unless they&#8217;d been invited. Chris and Gerry have been close friends for years (having once shared an apartment for a year), which is why he was invited early on.<br />
Chris and I were to fly out to Ottawa for the wedding. Stuart and Therese were also invited, but were conveniently already in Ontario due to another wedding. Chris was then invited to a second wedding (although it would come before Gerry&#8217;s) &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s brother Andre, who was getting married the day before.<br />
Confused? Good, most people were. (Originally, the primary wedding was Andre&#8217;s. Gerry and Sam were holding a &#8220;christening&#8221; the following day for their son. Little did most people know that the christening would be closely followed by a wedding.)<br />
Chris caught the red eye from Calgary on the 13th, arriving early Saturday morning in Ottawa. I would follow seven hours later &#8212; I didn&#8217;t feel the need to get to Ottawa so quickly. My flight was mostly uneventful, seated next to a young couple and their eight month old son. We chatted on and off throughout the flight. The meal was unremarkable, though not terrible. The movie was &#8220;Josie and the Pussycats&#8221;; although I would have normally watched it, it&#8217;s not the sort of movie I want to watch at that hour of the morning.<br />
Pearson was a little quieter than the previous few times I&#8217;d flown through it, though being the middle of July probably was a contributing factor. I was to switch to a Rapidair flight to Ottawa, although someone had neglected to give me a gate at which to find my flight. Luckily, I figured out that if you followed the signs that read &#8220;Ottawa / Montreal&#8221;, they led to where I had to go.<br />
The Ottawa flight was equally uneventful. At barely an hour, it was just long enough for the flight attendants to quickly hand out &#8220;snacks&#8221; (which was a half turkey and Swiss cheese sandwich on focaccia, a cup of some strange (albeit very tasty) pasta salad, and a pair of cookies). I found it ironic that the &#8220;snack&#8221; was far better than the breakfast.<br />
Arriving in Ottawa, I found myself searching for familiar landmarks. It had been five and a half years since I&#8217;d last been to our nation&#8217;s capital, and I was anxious to see how much it had changed. The only landmark I could see under the partly cloudy skies was the NSC&#8217;s wind tunnel.<br />
Whipping through the terminal, I soon found myself in the baggage claim area, looking for my friend Rebecca. However, we managed to miss each other in the tremendous sea of people that had formed around the door. It took us nearly ten minutes to meet up, but only when I spotted a young woman who looked vaguely familiar.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d seen Rebecca had been 3 May 1996, the day that she, Stefan, Dhar, and I had returned from a break-neck tour of the United States. (Stefan and Dhar I saw a couple months later when they were passing through Oakville.) She looked only a little older (most likely due to the students she had been teaching) and her hair was much shorter with a few blonde streaks, but she looked otherwise the same.<br />
We quickly exited the terminal and headed for her car. After calling Stefan to let him know we were headed back to their home, we resumed our &#8220;how are you doing?&#8221; conversation. It was a little awkward at first. The one thing I&#8217;ve found is that when you communicate with someone through email over an extended period of time, face-to-face conversation is always a little troublesome, much like a beginner with a manual transmission.<br />
Rebecca drove us deep into the heart of Ottawa. Once upon a time, it had been much closer to the south of Ottawa. But in the last five-odd years, Ottawa&#8217;s population has exploded, and houses were in places where I only remembered farmland and forest. It was, to say the least, odd.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca are in the midst of a massive renovation (one that will be ongoing for some time). After we got resettled, Rebecca gave me the grand tour of the their home. It&#8217;s a &#8217;50s tract home built for the returning soldiers of WWII. Like most of the homes in the area, it&#8217;s undergoing a few changes. (Though none quite so drastic as the tear-down/rebuilds a couple blocks away.) When complete, I&#8217;m sure their home will be a showpiece in the area.<br />
The conversation eased up, and soon we were bantering like we&#8217;d only seen each other a month ago. As we talked, I found pictures of their children, Eric and Thea. I hadn&#8217;t seen either of them in years &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen Thea since she was about six months old. Eric was only about six at the time.<br />
When Eric entered the house (at his mother&#8217;s request), he didn&#8217;t recognize me. I didn&#8217;t think he would. But after a moment, when he was told that I&#8217;d since shaven and cut my hair, there was a sudden &#8220;oh yeah!&#8221; as the light came on. Then he said &#8220;hello&#8221; and ran back out the door.<br />
*Sigh* To be (much) younger again&#8230;<br />
Stefan arrived home shortly thereafter, having spent the morning in a business meeting. It looked for a moment like Stefan and Rebecca had swapped hair &#8212; his was now much longer and (seemingly) more brown than I remembered.<br />
Conversation veered more into the technical from there, as Stefan and I caught up. This gave Rebecca a chance to start on dinner. (We had been rather indecisive with what we were going to do about dinner, so we ended up staying in.)<br />
Dinner at Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s is &#8230; interesting. The food is delectable, and the entertainment is well worth the price of admission. Eric is a natural comedian. Even though he&#8217;s not even a teenager yet, he&#8217;s well on his way to driving his parents nuts &#8230; add two spectators (Rebecca&#8217;s friend Marnie and yours truly), and the comedy just keeps rolling (especially since Marnie eggs Eric on, inadvertently or otherwise). Even Thea gets into it &#8212; most likely through influence from her brother.<br />
Following dinner, we adults decided to make a run for the bars, so we could ditch the kids for a while. Thea went to a sleepover at a friends, and Eric guarded the house. This left the four of us to find some corner of Ottawa to curl up into. But first, I was awarded a quick tour of the new and improved Ottawa.<br />
Since I last lived in Ottawa (summer 1994), much has changed. More companies have moved in, most notably JDS, a very large fibre optic company that seems to be edging out Nortel as the largest company in the area. The main facility they have there is immense, and it&#8217;s only one of several buildings JDS has in the Ottawa area.<br />
And then there are the houses. Endless tracts of houses. In places where you used to have to drive for long period of time before hitting a landmark, there are houses. Lots of houses. I don&#8217;t know what Ottawa&#8217;s population is up to now, but it was just shy of a million (Ottawa-Hull, to be precise) in 1994 &#8212; it&#8217;s gotta be pushing two million by now.<br />
After driving around for about 45 minutes, we ended up downtown along Elgin Street. I couldn&#8217;t remember the last time I&#8217;d been on Elgin, although it had been a very long time ago. Many of the stores I had known were gone. New ones had sprung up in their places, some were still vacant.<br />
Finding my hotel, I took a moment to drop off my things, so I could proceed gadget-free for the remainder of the evening. (Admittedly, a bit of a naked feeling, not having something with you for wireless communication or telling time.) Returning to the car, we turned onto MacLeod and drove over to Kent. My last apartment in Ottawa still stands on the corner of MacLeod and Kent. It&#8217;s still ugly, it&#8217;s still scummy, but surprisingly enough, hasn&#8217;t changed a bit since I last saw it.<br />
Much of downtown Ottawa has changed. More condos, less stores. The movie theatres are almost all gone &#8212; only the ones in the World Exchange Centre and Rideau Centre are left. Many familiar sites are gone, replaced with something newer. Even the Parliament Buildings have a fresh sheeting of copper &#8212; the distinctive green colour won&#8217;t be back for a decade.<br />
The Market, surprisingly, hasn&#8217;t changed that much. Aside from CHUM/City now occupying space in Market Mall for their radio and TV stations, the Market is almost the same as when I was last there. Some of the bars and restaurants have changed, but the atmosphere is the same, and some bars (most notably the Laff and the Dom) probably haven&#8217;t been cleaned, either.<br />
Parking in the Market, we ended up bar hopping a while, running from the Dom (where we found Dave, one of Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s many friends, and dragged him around with us), to Darcy McGee&#8217;s, to the Heart and Crown before running out of steam. I couldn&#8217;t help but remark at how much I missed being in Ottawa in the summer. It had been a lot of fun the two summers I was there &#8212; even when I had been trapped in Kanata that first year &#8212; and a part of me wanted to move back there to relive it all again.<br />
But I can&#8217;t dwell in the past.<br />
So it was with a twinge of sadness that I had to bid Stefan and Rebecca farewell when they dropped me off at the hotel later that night. I didn&#8217;t know when exactly I&#8217;d see them again &#8212; it had been over five years since the last time, which I don&#8217;t hope to repeat.<br />
I awoke a little later the following morning than I&#8217;d planned, but not enough to make us late. I showered, shaved, donned my best Hawaiian attire, and Chris and I grabbed a cab for east Nepean, and Gerry&#8217;s wedding.<br />
We arrived a little early to the house Andre rented with a few friends (at least, I assume it was a rental), but not before anyone else. Some strange people I didn&#8217;t recognize were already there. The rest were all busy getting ready for the afternoon. Gerry was one of them.<br />
He was under the crab apple tree at the back of the yard, apparently giving instructions. Being busy, there was only time for a quick &#8220;hello&#8221; before he ran off to finish whatever he was working on. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen Gerry in two and a half years, so I expected a bigger &#8220;hello&#8221;. But considering that this was his day in the limelight, I wasn&#8217;t about to say anything.<br />
Chris and I milled around for a while until others we knew began to show up. First, it was Marek and Brenda (who, along with Gerry and I, are ex-employees of Arkipelago in Toronto, where we all met), followed soon by Stuart and Therese. Before I knew it, Kathryn had arrived, with Dan in tow.<br />
The theme of the day was Hawaii. Why Hawaii? Probably because it&#8217;s an easier fashion to track down than &#8220;Bermudan&#8221;. Aside from black knee-high socks and longish shorts, I&#8217;m not really sure what Bermudan fashion entails. Either way, it meant that no-one had to wear anything truly uncomfortable.<br />
The first order of the afternoon was Alex&#8217; christening. Although born three-and-a-half months earlier, it&#8217;s a little more convenient to bring the baby to the family if the family is concentrated in a small area. Andre&#8217;s wedding happened to provide the perfect set-up for just such an occasion.<br />
I&#8217;d never seen Alex before. This was my first meeting with the young lad, but I suspect it&#8217;ll be a few years before he knows who I am. It was also my first time seeing Gerry with his son, a bit of a creepy thing too, I might add.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; Gerry&#8217;s gonna be a great dad. It&#8217;s just that &#8230; well &#8230; he&#8217;s a friend of mine who has a kid. It&#8217;s a little unnerving at times. A scant five years ago, most of my friends were unmarried. Now there are but a small number who aren&#8217;t either married or common-law. Soon, it&#8217;ll be only a small number who don&#8217;t have kids. You never seem to notice how old you are until an old roommate introduces you to their five year-old whom you haven&#8217;t met before.<br />
Gerry and Sam walked out with their son, quite proud to present him to a group of people, most of whom had not seen Alex outside of emailed photographs. He was bundled up in a (small) white gown, and clinging to his father. The ceremony was short &#8212; it was my first christening (not counting my own, which admittedly I don&#8217;t quite recall anymore), so I&#8217;m not entirely sure what was supposed to happen.<br />
The christening over, Sam and Alex disappeared into the house while Gerry mingled. (Gerry mingles well. Perhaps too well.) A moments later, Alex reappeared, dressed in his new Hawaiian shirt. I didn&#8217;t know they even made baby sizes, but I guess that makes sense. Denise cued some music, and to the tune of Hot Chocolate&#8217;s &#8220;You Sexy Thing&#8221;, Sam was led out by her bridesmaid across the deck, down the stairs, and up the aisle, taking a momentary pause to get into the groove of the song.<br />
The wedding itself was simple and sweet. No singing (which was beneficial, &#8216;cuz no-one really wants to hear me sing), no kneeling (which would have made taking pictures of the event a bit tricky), and there was a lot of laughter. Basically, the way a happy event should be&#8230;<br />
Gerry cried. A lot. He&#8217;s been waiting for this for years &#8212; I remember talking with him about it a few months ago, and how much he wanted to marry Sam. I guess it was his dream come true. Can&#8217;t say I blame him for being a bit teary-eyed &#8230; most people were, too.<br />
The wedding over, everyone clapped and cheered and cried, and then watched as Gerry and Sam made everything nice and legal. Almost as soon as the newly wedded (and christened) family was presented, Gerry asked Jamie to come forward for his announcement. Jamie asked Denise (Gerry&#8217;s sister) to come up to the front, where he promptly proposed.<br />
Kleenex would have made a killing.<br />
The mug shots came shortly thereafter, with various members of the now much larger family taking turns with the newlyweds and newly-engaged. I took this opportunity to introduce myself to Sam, whom I never met before. Strangely enough, my parents have &#8212; during a stopover in Bermuda while on a cruise, they met Sam when they called up Gerry. (My father had originally wanted to crash Gerry&#8217;s wedding as a surprise.) Sam seemed somewhat disinterested, but more than likely had no clue who the heck I was anyway. Besides, she probably had to meet several people that day.<br />
People started to break up into groups, where we all sat, chatted, ate, drank, and were merry. Some of us doubly so, since Gerry had made sure that the food included a whopping amount of Montreal smoked meat from Schwartz&#8217;s deli. Many of us revelled in a much-missed taste of great deli meats.<br />
As the afternoon drew into evening, the number of people slowly dwindled. Soon, there were but a few left &#8212; most of the family was now gone, leaving mostly friends. Sam and Gerry took the opportunity to start unwrapping the plethora of gifts they (and Alex) had received. I can only imagine what the crate they pack everything into will look like&#8230;<br />
After helping to clean up, word travelled around that dinner might be in order. A quick survey of the people who actually live in Ottawa (primarily Denise and Jamie) suggested that we go to Mama Grazzi&#8217;s, an Italian restaurant down in the Market. We planned to meet at 8:30, with some of us going a little earlier to obtain seats. There would be 14 of us, and Mama didn&#8217;t take reservations&#8230;<br />
Pulling teeth couldn&#8217;t be that hard. Even with six of us standing at the door of the restaurant, they wouldn&#8217;t even consider starting to move tables around for us. (Once I saw much room they had available, I was a little curious as to their initial unwillingness to help out what would inevitably be a large tip.) After about an hour of cajoling, pestering, extreme patience and a lot of &#8220;thank yous&#8221;, we managed to get enough tables to seat 14.<br />
Mama Grazzi&#8217;s isn&#8217;t the fastest restaurant in Ottawa &#8230; but the food is certainly worth waiting for. It&#8217;s almost enough to make me want to take a longer vacation there the next time I go back. Besides, it gave us a sufficiently long time to sit and chat.<br />
You wouldn&#8217;t have known that it was a wedding party. The only ones still in Hawaiian garb were those of us who came direct &#8212; Stuart, Therese, Kathryn, Dan, Chris, and myself. The rest all went back and changed. Otherwise, we looked like any other large group of people out for a good time.<br />
Dinner having ended, we all broke our separate ways. Therese and Stuart headed back to Therese&#8217;s parents place in Carp. Kathryn and Dan went back to their hotel room. The rest of us walked to the Travelodge where the majority were staying the night. There Chris and I bade farewell to Gerry, Sam, Brenda, and Marek. That pang of departure hit me again &#8212; I hoped it wouldn&#8217;t be another three years before I saw Gerry (and Sam and Alex) again. I also hope that next time I saw Brenda and Marek, it wouldn&#8217;t be at a wedding&#8230;<br />
I woke a little earlier the next morning, wanting to get a quick tour of Ottawa before catching my train. I wandered up O&#8217;Connor, and then over to Elgin before arriving at the War Memorial. I hadn&#8217;t really taken pictures of it before, and my attempts to catch the lighting of it the night before were dismal at best. It shone in the morning sun, the blue sky contrasting nicely on the cream granite.<br />
As I took pictures, I started to hear a strange sound &#8212; a marching band. At first, I thought I was just hearing things. But it kept getting louder. I looked down Elgin, only to see a full-blown regimental marching band coming up the street. At first I couldn&#8217;t figure out why &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t a holiday, it wasn&#8217;t a weekend &#8212; but after a moment, it hit me: The changing of the guard.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t seen the changing of the guard since I was a little kid, and my parents first took my sister and I to Ottawa. At the time, I thought Ottawa really dull. But unless it&#8217;s filled with cartoonish mascots and rollercoasters, I suspect a lot of kids would find Ottawa pretty dull. Heck, I know a lot of adults who find Ottawa really dull&#8230;<br />
As I walked down to see the parade go by, I heard a noise behind me that sounded vaguely like someone falling over. Normally, I would turn around. Normally, I would see if that person needed help. For some stupid reason, I didn&#8217;t at first. A moment later, I did, and saw it was an old man who was having trouble getting up. Suddenly, I felt like there was a giant neon sign above my head that read: &#8220;Here stands a callous, self-centred jerk.&#8221;<br />
The man was okay, he was quickly rescued by his middle-aged son. Didn&#8217;t make me feel any better, though. Made me a lot more aware of things around me for the rest of the day, though.<br />
I ended up racing the parade up to Parliament Hill, where the Changing of the Guard takes place. (For those of you interested, the parade enters Parliament Hill at 10:00am sharp &#8212; the bells in the Peace Tower ring almost right on cue.) Despite it being a Monday, there were people ringed all around the drill area. I stayed and watched as long as I dared, but before long (and before the ceremony was complete), I had to leave.<br />
Chris and I checked out of the hotel at roughly 11:30, right on time for me to catch a taxi to the train station. I was going home &#8212; to Oakville, that is. I was going to visit with my family for a couple of days before going back to Calgary. Normally, I would have taken a plane, and covered the distance in an hour. But I felt like I needed to continue a burgeoning tradition in my life.<br />
For two of the previous three years, I had taken a train trip on my birthday. Last year, I was so busy with work that I didn&#8217;t get to do anything interesting. So when I decided to make a side trip to Oakville on my birthday, I figured I&#8217;d do it with a little more style &#8212; I took the VIA train.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d taken VIA was when my father was living in London, selling Ford tractors and construction equipment. This was in the mid-to-late 70s. All I remember of it was the really bad TV dinner I had in my father&#8217;s apartment (the cold french fries still seem to haunt me after all these years). I don&#8217;t remember much else, except that we&#8217;d taken VIA to get there.<br />
Passenger trains in Canada aren&#8217;t what they used to be. Except in and around Toronto, where the GO Trains run on a tight schedule, you&#8217;d be lucky if your train runs right on time. But generally, if you&#8217;re going to take the train, time isn&#8217;t a big concern for you.<br />
The trip runs diagonally through Ottawa, down through several towns I don&#8217;t know the name of, through Smith Falls (where my family used to travel through on the way to a cottage on Charleston Lake), to Kingston, Gananoque, Belleville, and then into the Toronto area. It&#8217;s about a four-hour trip, provided you don&#8217;t get held up by other trains. Which, of course, we did.<br />
We got into Toronto at 5:20, about 35 minutes after we were scheduled to. After hopping off the train, I hustled into the GO lounge, got a ticket, ran onto a westbound GO Train, and continued my journey. I was in the Toronto city limits for all of about 30 minutes. My father picked me up in Clarkson and took me home.<br />
There are probably a few of you who are wondering why I didn&#8217;t call you. If I was in Toronto, it doesn&#8217;t take much to pick up the phone and call, right? That is true, but I had something else in mind, or more specifically, someone else.<br />
A couple of months ago, my family learned that my father had developed non-small cell lung cancer. A lifetime of smoking had finally done what I&#8217;d been expecting for two decades. Although I had gone home to see my family, my primary thoughts were with my father.<br />
It&#8217;s not easy living 3,000 kilometres away when you learn of something like this, even if you are expecting it. You want to be there. You want to help. You want to be the one who can make everything all right, and make the sickness go away. It&#8217;s not an easy thing to come to terms with, knowing that you&#8217;re isolated, and have to rely on others for information, and hope that everyone else knows that you&#8217;re there, even if your body isn&#8217;t.<br />
Needless to say, the family dynamic has changed a little. Instead of toddling along on our merry little way, we&#8217;re keeping an eye on things. As for dad, well, he&#8217;s in treatment, something I&#8217;m immensely proud of. Some people don&#8217;t go this route &#8212; they prefer to live as they did. But my father&#8217;s not going to take this sitting down &#8212; he&#8217;s going to do what seems to run in my family: be really, really, really stubborn.<br />
I even went with him for one of his treatments at Credit Valley Hospital. I&#8217;d heard it was more like a country club than a hospital. It&#8217;s certainly nicer than most of the hospitals I&#8217;ve been in over the past three years. And the oncology room is comfortable. It could be nicer, that&#8217;s for sure, but over all it&#8217;s not that bad. I have to credit dad for putting up with the needles, too. He&#8217;s been a human pincushion for the past few weeks. I can&#8217;t even stand getting a booster shot.<br />
The funny thing was everyone warning me about what he looked like. Frankly, I couldn&#8217;t see any real change. Maybe a little older (stress tends to do that), but otherwise none the worse for wear. He looked every bit as strong as the last time I&#8217;d seen him. And I&#8217;ve never seen him eat as much as he currently does &#8212; he eats more than I do!<br />
I spent three days in Oakville with my family. Aside from close family friends who dropped by, I saw no-one else, and I talked with no-one else. It&#8217;s nothing personal, folks, but I have my priorities, and my family comes first.<br />
Because of everything I&#8217;d heard before I came home, I was a little apprehensive. But upon leaving, I knew that things would be alright. I was able to board my plane, knowing without a doubt that he&#8217;ll be in great shape the next time I see him, in early September (I&#8217;m going to Toronto for another wedding).<br />
So just to let you know, Dad, my thoughts are with you, as always. I don&#8217;t need to tell you to be strong, because you already are. I don&#8217;t need to tell you to have no fear, because you never have. Just keep following your heart and your head, and you&#8217;ll do no wrong.<br />
Some say that everything they know in life they learned in Kindergarten. I learned it from my father.<br />
Thanks, dad.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was once said that the only thing to fear is fear itself. Fear is the oppressor of souls and nations. It is the beginnings of hatred and suffering. And it&#8217;s what has kept me away from Vancouver. Fear of my past. Fear of opening old wounds.<br />
This is why on Friday past, one year, two months, and four days since I left Vancouver, that I felt it was time to face those fears.<br />
Well, actually, it was a month earlier that I made the decision, but you get my point&#8230;<br />
It basically stemmed from one email I received from my friend Greg, suggesting I come out to see a baseball game in Seattle with some of my former co-workers (and current friends) from Radical. It was part spur-of-the-moment, part &#8220;I really need to get out of this office for a couple days!&#8221;, but when it really came down to it, it was time for me to go back.<br />
I&#8217;d had the opportunity a couple times before, the most recent previous one being an invitation to Katrina&#8217;s &#8220;Glug&#8221; party, a tradition she and Guy have at Christmas. However, I&#8217;d never really felt ready. I had always said I was busy (which was true), but primarily, I knew that mentally and emotionally, I hadn&#8217;t forced off my demons &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t ready to go back.<br />
Rising early on Friday, I made my way to the airport to catch my 7:50am flight to Vancouver. I took public transit, partly for the heck of it, and partly so I&#8217;d get a better idea of times for the next time I do this. Not having the best information available on times and schedules, I ended up with about 20 minutes to wait for the bus once I&#8217;d reached the end of the C-Train line.<br />
I watched the sun rise above the houses, casting long shadows across the bus terminal, and shedding light on a dawn of reawakening. (It&#8217;s amazing the stuff you can dish out when you&#8217;re being philosophical, eh?) It was my first real thoughts about what I was about to do. Would I run into my past, and would she confront me? Would I see any of her friends? And more importantly, what would I do? These were questions I was unable to answer, even though I&#8217;ve been thinking about that very thing for over a year.<br />
Soon I found myself at the airport, awaiting the boarding for the flight. Unlike my previous flights with Air Canada (see [[Christmas in Oakville, New Years Eve in Calgary]]), this flight left right on time. The flight was uneventful &#8212; up, breakfast, read, down. All told, about an hour and 10 minutes.<br />
Descending into Vancouver was &#8230; weird. I recognized everything. Surrey, Coquitlam, Burnaby, New Westminster, the Port Mann Bridge, Metrotown, the Richmond Auto Mall, IKEA. It almost felt like I&#8217;d never left, but at the same time, there was a strange feeling. Something between excitement and knowing you&#8217;re being watched.<br />
BC Transit being on strike, I had to take a taxi to get out of the airport. (Although Greg had offered to pick me up, I had told him not to waste his time &#8212; I knew he already had a killer schedule, and going to the airport is quite a bit out of his way.) The trip was quite, pleasant, and a brisk drive down memory lane. In less than 20 minutes, I was standing on the corner of 10th and Granville, wondering what I was going to do next.<br />
The first thing I did was call Lee, who had been Radical&#8217;s Director of QA and the coach of the Rad Sox. Being already at work, we agreed to meet that night, as planned, at Soho&#8217;s in Yaletown. I so proceeded to step #2 &#8212; wait. I wanted to hold off until about 9:30 before calling Katrina (another friend and former co-worker), but I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her too early in the morning. (More on this in a few paragraphs.)<br />
So it was off to one of a thousand local Starbuck&#8217;s to indulge in my second hot chocolate of the morning (the first being at the Blenz in Calgary airport). I sat, sipping my venti, and really thought about where I was. I actually sat with my back to the door, a little worried about who might walk through it.<br />
Irrational fears are the worst kind.<br />
After pondering the state of affairs for about a half hour (ventis are pretty big), I retreated to the moist Vancouver air, and proceeded to contact Katrina. I had hoped to meet up with her that morning, as I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I was going to do that day. I had originally hoped to meet up with Lee for coffee, and then visit with Katrina later that morning. However, things don&#8217;t always go according to plan &#8212; Katrina was busy getting all the things she and her husband needed to pack everything in their home so they could move to San Francisco.<br />
I sat next to Katrina for two years. She&#8217;s one of the people I miss most about Vancouver, along with several of my co-workers. They were what made my life there happier than it would have been. But now Katrina was also an ex-Radicalite, and moving on with her life by accepting a position at Pixar. Yes, the same people who brought you the &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; movies and &#8220;A Bug&#8217;s Life&#8221;. Not only am I impressed, but I can actually say I know someone at Pixar. This was too cool.<br />
Resigning myself to having a morning on my own, I proceeded to run errands. First was a quick stop to the bank to deposit a rebate cheque (I had to deposit it in person, and getting to the bank during the day ain&#8217;t easy). I then stopped quickly at Bernard Callebaut to pick up some chocolates as a kind of &#8220;bon voyage&#8221; present for Katrina and Guy.<br />
Then I wandered. I wander well, particularly when I have nothing else to do, and I know (more or less) where I&#8217;m going.<br />
I headed towards downtown along Granville. I decided I wanted to go to Burrard Inlet and look around. It wasn&#8217;t a great day &#8212; the sky was overcast and I was being spit on periodically from above &#8212; but it was good day for looking around. But being in a wandering mood, I made a side trip through Granville Island, one of my favourite places in the city.<br />
On my way in, I stopped to donate some spare change to Jack &#8220;The Bear&#8221;, a self-employed social worker who strives to make his &#8220;group&#8221; (whomever they are) better off. I&#8217;d seen and heard of this guy before, and not being in a rush, I allowed myself (somewhat unwittingly) to end up in a half-hour pseudo-speech. He&#8217;s an articulate man, and he certainly has some interesting ideas. I tried to offer a few suggestions (his ideas, though good, need the odd improvement), but getting a word in edgewise is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s easier sliding papers between the blocks of the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<br />
I wandered about the Island a bit, and went into the market. They say that smell is one of the most powerful memory triggers. The second I walked in the door, it felt like someone was force feeding me 1,000 TV channels at once as snippets of two years suddenly raced through my mind. Some good, some bad &#8230; but after a moment, all I could smell was the produce, and food is always good. It took a lot of will power to get out of the market without buying anything.<br />
I exited the Island via the Aquabus, which ferried me to the other side of False Creek. This was far better than walking all the way back to the foot of the Granville Street Bridge, and then walking all the way back downtown again. I hadn&#8217;t really noticed how much I missed the smell of the sea, not until I got near the water. The smell is unmistakable, and wonderful. I think I was a fish in a previous life&#8230;<br />
The wandering continued as I worked my way down Granville. Not much had changed &#8212; same stores, same buildings, even some of the same people. The city line had a few new condos, and there was the odd old building reduced to a parking lot, but otherwise it was the same. Tagging (a form of graffiti) was very prevalent, especially at the Paradise and Caprice theatres (both now closed). Not unsurprising, I hate to say. The Eaton&#8217;s was open again. A new pub sat kiddie-corner, which had been abandoned or under construction during the entire time I was in Vancouver. A new London Drugs is open at the corner of Granville and Georgia. It used to be book store, which went under when Chapters moved into town. The London Drugs had moved from its old store further down the road, now open to anyone silly enough to lease the space.<br />
Canada Place was seeing some new construction. I had vaguely remembered a plan to expand the pier to increase convention space. The plan, it seemed, was thoroughly under way. As such, my favourite vantage point to view Burrard Inlet was unavailable. Instead, I took up a viewpoint on the promenade between Waterfront Station and the Province&#8217;s building.<br />
Although the view was essentially the same as the last time I&#8217;d viewed it, something seemed different. Not as much life &#8212; it seemed almost a little dead. I don&#8217;t know if it was a changed perspective due to my departure a year earlier, or if it was the weather. It almost looked like someone had dropped out some of the colour from the image I was seeing.<br />
I was still a little afraid, I think.<br />
Through Waterfront Station, and onto Water Street, I walked through Gastown. Not much had changed there, either. A couple stores had moved, a couple closed, and one lot (or building, I&#8217;m not sure which) had been opened up. I think there had been a restaurant there once, but I can&#8217;t really remember. The same burned out husk of a building sat across the street from the Olde Spaghetti Factory, though the structure supports had been beefed up a lot. I shook my head, wondering what on earth was going on there.<br />
I turned up Carrall Street, and headed back towards False Creek, Science World glinting in the distance. In moments, I realized that I&#8217;d made a bit of a blunder. This is what I get for pondering and not paying attention. I found myself at the corner of Carrall and W. Hastings. It&#8217;s known as Pigeon Park, and has the highest murder rate of any location in Canada. It&#8217;s not pleasant during the day &#8230; but you don&#8217;t go near it at night. I briskly walked through and on across the road. I didn&#8217;t feel safer until a couple of blocks later.<br />
I stalled a bit longer (I wasn&#8217;t due at Radical until almost 1pm) and made a side trip through the International Village, a large mall, still mostly empty over a year and a half since it opened. It looks really nice, but I wonder how much money they must lose from the lack of tenants.<br />
Up Abbott, I arrived at Pacific. This took me over towards Quebec Street, and onto Terminal Avenue. I was in the home stretch. Aside from Greg, I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone from Radical in over a year. Fear was rapidly being overcome by nervous combination of excitement and panic.<br />
My first run-in was with Fernando and one of the Foundation developers, whose name I couldn&#8217;t remember, even though he started at Radical the same day I did (my panic began to rise as I realized I couldn&#8217;t remember names). A few moments later, I entered the foyer of Radical&#8217;s new home, and headed right to the top floor.<br />
The receptionist I didn&#8217;t recognize. Lisa was gone, so I find out, having quit back in the summer. Greg could not be found, nor could Joel. Luckily, we could find Neall. As I waited for him to arrive, I heard my name being called by Allison. She had also started the same day as me, but unlike myself, was quite comfortable at her job. She looked good as ever, and still bore the same wonderful smile she always seemed to have.<br />
Neall hadn&#8217;t changed much, either &#8212; though I was just as happy to see him again. The reunions started to come quickly as Dave appeared through the main door, and Fred from the back office. Names were flitting around in my head so fast, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I nearly forgot Fred&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Neall offered to take me on a quick tour, and show me what Radical had moved in to. Having used up all their old space, Radical had taken a lease in a near-brand new building, and had the interior made up to their specifications. It&#8217;s quite nice, really &#8230; especially the log cabin in the common room.<br />
Yes, a log cabin. It&#8217;s their home theatre. I&#8217;ve seen and heard of some pretty wacky things in companies, but this is one of the wackiest. The common room at Radical is two stories tall, and easily big enough to fit a small house. It also has a 270+ degree view of Vancouver, including what must be a magnificent view of the North Shore.<br />
A new building, but it wasn&#8217;t much different than the old building &#8212; totally organic space, managers in the middle, work teams scattered around the outside. Greg had commented that Critical Mass&#8217; building looks more polished, but for the environment, I know a lot of people here would prefer Radical&#8217;s setup.<br />
Eric was still in a dungeon. This is where he likes to be &#8212; in the dark, away from everyone. I assume it lets him get on with his work. Martin was with him, discussing physics calculations. Mark was in the office he shared with Neall, looking none the worse for wear. Across from the office was Jean-Luc and Senta (whose name I sadly forgot, and I felt like such a heel for forgetting it), and a desk away was Nigel. He summed up my return rather succinctly: &#8220;The more things change, the more they stay the same.&#8221;<br />
Down the floor, I ran into Lisa (the office manager) and Cliff (one of the IT guys). I inadvertently interrupted their conversation, but they didn&#8217;t seem to mind too much. Neall took me down a floor to show me around a bit more. There were a lot of familiar faces, but many of them without names. I was now feeling particularly bad about forgetting so many people. It wasn&#8217;t until later that I remembered Yayoi&#8217;s and Rod&#8217;s names, something I&#8217;m not horribly proud of. Jesse seemed a bit surprised to see me, but then I don&#8217;t think he knew I was coming out.<br />
Returning to the seventh floor, I finally found Greg. He immediately started to apologize for not being around. Greg was up to his neck in E3 preparations. The game he&#8217;s working on has to be down there for exhibition, and there were still a lot of issues to clear up. Although it had been planned a month in advance, I hadn&#8217;t picked the best weekend to come out.<br />
Just before lunch, I finally ran into Tim, my old boss. He&#8217;s now one of the VPs (Neall is now the head of Pure3D), although I don&#8217;t know of what specifically. He had always been a fairly serious person while I was there, but he seemed somehow happier. I&#8217;m not sure if it was the haircut, but he looked better off.<br />
Members of Pure3D (Neall, Mark, Nigel) and Pure3D alumni (Kevin, Greg, Gabe, and myself) all went out for lunch, to a place called The Whip. (Gabe picked us up; like me, Gabe is also an ex-Radicalite.) It seemed somehow wrong that we weren&#8217;t eating anything Asian. Pure3D ritual had been typically Chinese. This was definitely not Chinese &#8230; although it was very tasty. The conversation, though, was definitely Pure3D.<br />
The more things change&#8230;<br />
After lunch, I finally met up with Joel. He&#8217;d been a bit of a harder character to find, being the lead programmer for one of Radical&#8217;s projects (meetings being the bane of his existence). He looked tired, like everyone else on the team. Being sick probably didn&#8217;t help much, either. We talked for a while, but I chose to keep the conversation fairly short, as he was busy dealing with the crises of getting a game ready for E3.<br />
I took the opportunity to leave Radical and go visit with Katrina and Guy. By now, it was raining outside, so I was quite happy to find the Aquabus still running between Science World and Stamp&#8217;s Landing, where Katrina and Guy live. They were home, and it only took a few moments (with a bit of direction) to get down to their slip.<br />
Oh, did I mention they live on a sailboat?<br />
This was why it was so difficult for them to get ready to move. Not only do they have to pack their belongings, they have to move their house as well. Logically, not an easy move. But they seemed fairly calm about it &#8212; most people get downright cranky when they move.<br />
I spent most of the afternoon with them, talking for a while, but them helping them pack. It was partly because I wanted to get the skinny on their move. It had come out of nowhere (at least from my perspective), and I was very curious to get their thoughts on it. They were excited. New place, new challenges, and it sounded like a lot of fun. Not wanting to get in their way of packing, I&#8217;d also offered to help them pack. Katrina and I spent the afternoon wrapping things in bubble wrap.<br />
I probably stayed longer than I really should have, but I felt compelled to not just drop in for a few minutes and then bolt. After all, I&#8217;d spent two years sitting next to Katrina, working with her, talking with her, and learning from her. Besides, until I go to San Francisco, I don&#8217;t know when (or even if) I&#8217;ll ever see her again.<br />
At 7:00, all three of us had to leave. Katrina and Guy were going to a friend&#8217;s place, and I was due to go to SoHo&#8217;s and meet up with Lee (and hopefully, people whose names I could remember). Despite being nearly 40 minutes late by the time I got there, I was the first to show. (Hopefully, we didn&#8217;t scare off any other potential revellers.) The second person to arrive was Ryan, a Radicalite whom I wasn&#8217;t sure was there to come out with us, or was meeting other friends. Luckily, he remembered me, and reintroduced himself. I was glad, because even when I was at Radical, I really didn&#8217;t know who he was&#8230;<br />
We talked at length until Lee arrived. You&#8217;d swear no time had passed since the last time I&#8217;d seen her. She didn&#8217;t look a day older, and was just as upfront as ever, just the way we love her. It didn&#8217;t take long for any awkwardness to pass. Soon, we were embroiled in animated conversation, along with one of Lee&#8217;s co-workers, who had also come out. Not too many Radicalites (ex or otherwise) came out that night, although I was very happy to see Lisa (the ex-receptionist) again. I&#8217;d always thought I&#8217;d gotten along with her very well, and had missed saying &#8220;hi&#8221; to her every morning.<br />
Somewhere in the evening, I stopped looking over my shoulder. I stopped looking in the shadows. I stopped being apprehensive. It was like I suddenly knew the story, like I&#8217;d already seen the movie and knew exactly when the creepy, half-dead monster leaps out. It was like the fear had dissipated like morning fog. Sure, the past will always be there, but spending the day in Vancouver, and with my friends, had shown me there was nothing to fear. It was only then that I truly felt relaxed.<br />
Neall appeared around 10:30, and joined our little group. Greg made a brief appearance, only to apologize for not coming out. The debate of where I would stay that night (begun earlier in the day) apparently had been solved &#8212; Neall would drop me off at Mark&#8217;s on our way home in preparation for the next day. This left Greg to quickly go to a friend&#8217;s birthday party, catch a few hours sleep, and get back to work early the next day. Sadly, because of the deadline, Greg wasn&#8217;t coming with us.<br />
Neall and I finally managed to leave SoHo&#8217;s around 12:30. I gave Lee a big hug (we&#8217;d had a good, deep conversation for most of the night, and I remembered all over again why I missed being around people like her), and stepped out into the cool night. Neall and I walked back to Radical, enjoying the walk, and talking about the state of Radical. It was refreshing to see how things had evolved since I&#8217;d left. It was very reassuring to see that management (including Neall, now that&#8217;s he&#8217;s part of the &#8220;establishment&#8221;) still has a firm grip and good steer of the Good Ship Radical.<br />
Fires were raging when we got into the office. A Pure3D patch hadn&#8217;t taken well, and Neall had to help out Vlad (the technical director) to get the software working again. Also, we were giving Eric a lift, and he was still working out a few issues with a demo he was programming. (He&#8217;d been at it since late Wednesday, I believe &#8230; non-stop. He hadn&#8217;t gone home.) Due to these reasons, we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 2:30. This also meant I was now staying at Neall&#8217;s, because it was now too late to go to Mark&#8217;s.<br />
I crashed on Neall&#8217;s couch that night. I was exhausted. I&#8217;d been up for just about 23 hours straight since that morning, walked about 10 kilometres since that morning, ate almost nothing outside of a sandwich at lunch, and was ready to fall dead. I was asleep in seconds.<br />
The alarm came far too early for my liking. But we had to get rolling fast &#8212; we had a baseball game to go to. Although the game didn&#8217;t start until 1:05pm, we had to pick up Neall&#8217;s sister, drive to Mark&#8217;s, pick up Gabe, and then drive to Seattle. It&#8217;s not a long drive, but it still takes time. Although we moved as fast as possible, we were delayed by a mysterious case of nose bleed, which I have yet to explain. (It plagued me the entire weekend.)<br />
After a slight detour to pick up Angie (Neall&#8217;s sister), we arrived at Mark and Carol&#8217;s to switch to a different vehicle. Our trip to Seattle would be in style &#8212; a Warner Brothers edition Chevy Venture. Nothing like being able to play video games and watch movies during the trip. Then it was off through to the west end of Richmond to pick up Gabe. It was almost 10am by the time we were all on our way to the border.<br />
We arrived in Seattle around noon. Mark deftly whizzed us through the various onramps and city streets towards the Port of Seattle, where Safeco Field lies. (It&#8217;s adjacent to the site of the former Kingdome, now the site of the new football stadium.) You can&#8217;t miss Safeco Field &#8212; it&#8217;s big. And it&#8217;s colour is unique for the area it sits in. There I found that Carol wasn&#8217;t joining the game with us &#8212; she was going shopping while we enjoyed America&#8217;s pastime. Unfortunately, that also meant she took the van with her, which contained my jacket. (Upon hopping out, Gabe and I declared that it was warm enough to go without jackets &#8212; Angie and Mark were far wiser, and Neall had a heavy shirt.)<br />
Safeco Field, although new and (assumedly) state-of-the-art, was built in the tradition of the great baseball fields: Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. It&#8217;s also a dedicated baseball stadium &#8212; no other sports (or events, as near as I can tell) occupy the space. The field is grass, and the stands are open to the wind &#8212; only the roof rolls shut to block out the rain (important on the West Coast).<br />
Our seats were at first base, about 20 rows up. Aside from the overhang of the upper deck which blocked the view of some of the flies, they were great seats. We were also one row away from the promenade, where we could find virtually any snack food imaginable, including the ubiquitous hot dogs, but also garlic fries, fish and chips, clam chowder, hamburgers, pizza &#8230; and all by local companies, no McDonald&#8217;s or Versa Foods here.<br />
This was Game 2 in a series between the Mariners and the Blue Jays. The last time I&#8217;d seen a Blue Jays game was about 10 years ago in Skydome, though it might have been 11 &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen so many, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Almost all of my Jays games had been courtesy of a family friend, Mr. Gairdner, who offered us his season tickets from time to time. I had forgotten in those years just how much fun professional baseball really is.<br />
Well, when you&#8217;re not freezing to death.<br />
I made one major mistake. I left my jacket in the car. I should have been smart and brought it with me. But no, I thought I was fine. Stupid me. I forgot that I was on the West Coast, where the humidity is much higher. I&#8217;m beginning to realize that until the temperature rises into the low 20s (Celsius, of course), it will always be cold for me in the more humid regions of the world. Living in Calgary has dried me out, and my immunity to the cold seems to have waned. I can hack -20 degree weather here quite easily. But minus six in Toronto was brutal at Christmas (I wasn&#8217;t even phased by -20 when I used to live in Ontario), and I was finding that even 13 degrees in Seattle was cold, especially with the wind. I chose to put up with the chilliness, rather than fork out the money for a Mariner&#8217;s jacket&#8230;<br />
The opening ceremonies were a different spin on what I remember from Toronto. Like the Hitmen games I&#8217;d seen last month, Major League Baseball now has games to entertain viewers &#8212; kids&#8217; home run derbies, and pitching contests. Personally, I think it cheapens the game, reducing the game to almost something of a sideshow.<br />
What impressed me was the singing of the national anthems. They brought in the Walla Walla High School Chamber Group. Although American, they sung perhaps the most amazing rendition of &#8220;O Canada&#8221; I&#8217;ve ever heard. It actually brought a tear to my eye. Mark was the only one of us who sang along &#8230; I usually don&#8217;t because my singing usually sends people running for dear life. The choir&#8217;s rendition of &#8220;Star Spangled Banner&#8221; was, sadly, typically American &#8212; seldom sung the way it was written. There are times I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m Canadian, where our national anthem is sung only two ways, English and French, and is always the same length.<br />
I&#8217;m not entire sure how many Canadians were there that day (we saw a few Canadian flags floating around), but there was a fair bit of cheering when Toronto took the field. Understandably, though, the cheering was much louder when Seattle came out &#8230; especially for their right fielder, Ichiro Suzuki. He&#8217;s one of two Japanese players with Seattle, and both are immensely popular, the other being closing pitcher Kazuhiro Sasaki. They&#8217;re good players &#8212; Ichiro hits a mean ball, and Kazuhiro throws a pretty vicious pitch.<br />
The game was tight &#8212; a couple home runs, some really great fielding, good solid hits, and the odd error made for some really good drama. I remembered watching the World Series back in 1992 in the townhouse I shared with roommates Roger, Ed, and Brian, screaming at the mistakes and groaning every hit the Braves made during the sixth game of the World Series, only to later wake the dead (along with everyone else in the complex) as the Jays went onto victory.<br />
Different team, different city, different opponents, and not even a championship on the line &#8230; the emotions were all the same. We all huffed at missed chances, cheered for the really good plays, and whined when the Mariners scored. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a blow-out for either team &#8212; a good solid race clear through. The only way I would&#8217;ve enjoyed it more was if I&#8217;d been warmer.<br />
By the seventh inning, I was chilled to the bone. Neall noticed my sad plight, and literally gave me the shirt off his back. I knew the four of them were laughing me &#8212; admittedly, I was laughing at myself. Once upon a time, the cold didn&#8217;t bother me. I hate to admit it, but I&#8217;m a damp weather wimp now.<br />
The game ended on a down note &#8212; the Jays lost 7-5. After watching the roof close (which is a bit of spectacle in itself), we worked our way out and tried to meet up with Carol. The only problem was navigating through the 42,000 other fans who were doing roughly the same thing. Fortunately for us, Carol and I were both equipped with cell phones, so after a few conversations, we managed to all meet up.<br />
Departing the port, we headed into the downtown area, to Pioneer Square, and the Elliott Bay Book Store. This is perhaps the coolest book store I&#8217;ve ever been in. It&#8217;s huge &#8212; about the size of a chapters, only with more books. And it&#8217;s in (what I would assume to be) a heritage building. Being from Alberta, buying books in the States doesn&#8217;t really save me any money, so I just took the time to look around.<br />
Hunger soon had it&#8217;s call, though, and we were off in search of food. Unfortunately, no-one was particularly helpful in deciding where to go. We drove somewhat aimlessly around Seattle trying to find a place to eat, all the while asking &#8220;where are we going?&#8221;. We ultimately ended up at 13 Coins, a restaurant Mark had learned about in a travel guide.<br />
One day, I will finally obtain proof that the restaurants that appear in travel guides are only there because the restaurateurs bribed the author. Of all the so-called great places to eat that I&#8217;ve read about, only a couple were actually good. Unfortunately, 13 Coins wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
This place had decor that even Elvis would be terrified of. I was convinced that someone had loved the 70s so much, that they refused to redecorate with anything less awful. But when you take into account the &#8220;cheese factor&#8221; of such a place, it&#8217;s kind of interesting &#8230; for a novelty, that is.<br />
The quality of the food, so I&#8217;ve found, usually matches the decor. And believe me, it was pretty darn hard to find something on the menu that I wanted to eat. (Mind you, it was mostly because I was still full from the hot dog, chicken strips and fries, and the tepidly bland hot chocolate I&#8217;d had at Safeco Field.) I settled on a Philadelphia Steak Sandwich, which turned out to be a small piece of beef on garlic toast. Not great, but I&#8217;ve had worse.<br />
The trip back to Vancouver was marked with the showing of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221;. (Note to self: Make sure there is a video system in my next car.) Despite it being one of my favourite movies, I still fell asleep for about an hour or so. The movie ended just as we were pulling into Richmond, and dropped off Gabe. The next stop was at Radical, where I was going to meet up with Greg. I grabbed all my things (I&#8217;d brought my bag with me), and said goodbye. I called up to Greg, who came down to let me in. A quick thumbs-up sent Mark, Carol, Neall, and Angie off into the night.<br />
Greg, along with several of his team members, were hard at work on their game. It was going to be a late night, which Greg immediately started apologizing for. But frankly, I didn&#8217;t mind hanging out at Radical. I always liked hanging out there, even when I was the only one. It was a fun company, and near as I can tell, still is. Greg and I struck a happy medium &#8212; while he coded, I would test.<br />
So for the next four hours, I played a game that no-one will see for about four months. And no, I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it. I will say this &#8212; it&#8217;s a LOT of fun. Greg, like most of the programmers I worked with at Radical, are wizards &#8212; they can churn out some of the most amazing things I&#8217;ve ever seen or played. This game was no different. Although it won&#8217;t set any new standards for graphics, the game play is outstanding &#8230; definitely better than another game that will ultimately be compared so when it finally ships.<br />
The game doesn&#8217;t wrap up until early August. So why the crunch in early May? The Electronic Entertainment Exposition, known as E3, which is in mid-May. This is when all the Christmas games first appear. This is when game companies try to outdo each other. This is *the* event if you work in the video game industry. And this game is debuting there. Like any good video game project, they were under the gun to tweak enough stuff to make it play really well, and make a lot of people very jealous.<br />
Personally, I think they nailed it perfectly.<br />
Somewhere around 2am, Greg and I headed out for his place in very east Burnaby. We stayed up for a short while and talked, but we were both so tired, we opted for sleep instead.<br />
Sunday morning came around 9:30. I was still exhausted from the day before, but rose and showered and prepared for the day. Not there was much to prepare for &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much on the agenda. A quick breakfast at IHOP, and we went back into the office. We weren&#8217;t there too long, as I had to go to the airport. This time, Greg drove me out, which I was thankful for (the transit strike makes getting a taxi outside of the airport rather difficult). I bid him farewell, he drove back to work, and I checked in for the flight.<br />
I slept on the way back, though not intentionally. I was utterly wiped. I hadn&#8217;t been so active in so long that my body simply wasn&#8217;t ready for it. I vaguely remember something about 35,000 feet, and something about returning my seat to its original upright position. Next thing I knew, I was hopping the bus home. And as we all know, home is where the heart, bed, and 50&#8243; TV are. This was where I was determined to spend the next several hours &#8230; sleeping.<br />
Unfortunately, it seemed that my vacation would be cut short. Crisis at Critical Mass &#8212; the site I was working on had basically fallen apart in my absence. Somehow, I&#8217;d become the centre of communications, and without me around, everything came to a halt. I didn&#8217;t get home until 1:30am.<br />
I look back at my weekend, and I actually have to force myself to believe I was actually there. With all the apprehension I had towards going back, I now find it hard to believe I did it. But I know I did, and I&#8217;m glad I did. I&#8217;m glad I saw my friends again (despite the fact that I feel like a twit for forgetting names). I&#8217;m glad I saw a Blue Jays game (even though they lost). But most of all, I&#8217;m glad that my past is now just that &#8212; behind me. All that&#8217;s left is the possibility of the future.<br />
Vancouver is a destination for me. Not to live, but certainly to visit. I will see sights I never saw, I will do things I never got the chance to do. I&#8217;m content that no matter what I see and do, it was because of me (with a lot of support from my family and friends) that I&#8217;m capable of doing it. And so long as I know people in Vancouver, or at least have an inkling of a reason, I will go there, and I will enjoy myself each and every minute.<br />
At least when it isn&#8217;t raining.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been one of those years. I really hope I don&#8217;t have to go through another one like that again. ClichÃ©d though it be, it was a year for rediscovery &#8212; mostly of myself. I lost my self-identity in Vancouver, allowing myself to be overwhelmed by another. It takes a while to rebuild that sort of thing. It&#8217;s not done yet, but having gone through that I know now what to avoid should I ever be so stupid as to get myself into that situation again&#8230;<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I didn&#8217;t think it was possible for 10 days to go by so fast&#8230;<br />
Having missed Christmas at home last year (for reasons I don&#8217;t think I need to go into), I decided a month or so ago to return home and experience Christmas the way it was meant to be experienced &#8212; with too much food, long waits at airports, problems finding the right gifts, and complaining about traffic on the QEW.<br />
Chris and I made the trip home together, leaving Calgary on 20 December. Hearing that the airport had been pretty busy the day before, and that line-ups at Air Canada&#8217;s check-in were often length, I suggested that we head to the airport a bit early (our flight was for 5:15 that afternoon). Our taxi picked us up at about 2:20, and dropped us off at the airport around 2:50. We were at the check-in by 3:00, and all ready to go by 3:05.<br />
For a flight that wouldn&#8217;t leave until 7:00 that night. Lousy delays.<br />
Chris and I spent an enlightened four hours at the airport, discussing many topics (including theology, architecture, physics, literature, and whether or not we&#8217;d be seated with any attractive single women on our flight) and reading. At least it was in Calgary airport, and not in the plane on the tarmac (which I went through in &#8217;98, and wasn&#8217;t too keen on reliving).<br />
Turned out that the plane had hydraulic problems prior to leaving Toronto. Air Canada, in it&#8217;s infinite wisdom, opted to fix the plane &#8230; and not replace it with a working aircraft, thus screwing up schedules (and probably cancelling a flight or two). We didn&#8217;t get into Toronto until 1:30.<br />
Chris and I went shopping the following day, not having brought any gifts with us from Calgary (it was extra bulk we didn&#8217;t want to have to deal with). Chris and I were in generous moods, having both received healthy Christmas bonuses from Critical Mass for all our hard work and diligence &#8230; yeah, it&#8217;s hard keeping a straight face writing stuff like that.<br />
On the 23rd, I headed out to Port Credit to meet with an old friend of mine, Kim. She was a classmate of mine from university (we suffered through possibly the worst technical writing class ever devised &#8212; I&#8217;m certain we students could have instructed that course better than the professor). She and I have gone through similar relationship hells over the past year, and have discussed our horror stories at length over email. It was the first time in about four or five years that I would see her.<br />
Despite a short wait at the train station, we finally met again, although the meeting was a tad awkward &#8212; Kim had let her hair return to it&#8217;s natural brown colour, and I had cut my rather lengthy hair and shaved. Then came the next surprise &#8212; Kim&#8217;s friend Laura. Kim was visiting Laura and her husband Ray, who were gracious enough to put up with me for the afternoon. The surprise came when I climbed into the back seat to meet her mysterious friend, only to realize that I&#8217;d had classes with Laura in university. [Insert music to &#8220;It&#8217;s A Small, Small World&#8221; here.] That pretty much set the stage for an afternoon of pseudo-reminiscing and tech talk (with Ray &#8212; I believe Kim and Laura described it as &#8220;getting along like a house on fire&#8221;).<br />
Laura and Ray were heading off to Stratford for Christmas, so Kim and I ducked out to the GO Station for the trip into Toronto (Kim was going home, I was meeting Chris and friends for dinner and a movie). We continued our talk during the trip. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little uncomfortable, though I honestly don&#8217;t know why. It might have been the gap in time between the last time that I saw her, or I wasn&#8217;t sure what to talk about next.<br />
Email conversations are so much easier&#8230;<br />
Kim and I parted ways at Union Station, as she had to catch the TTC home. I continued my wanderings in the PATH (Toronto&#8217;s underground mall-cum-labyrinth) and actually managed to find my way to the Eaton Centre without getting lost, taking a wrong turn, or even consulting a map. (No, I have no idea how I pulled that off.)<br />
Still having an hour or so before meeting up with Chris, I completed the last of my Christmas shopping. Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; Christmas shopping at the Eaton Centre at Christmas, I must be insane? Well, if you&#8217;re asking that question, it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;ve forgotten who I am&#8230; That said, it actually wasn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; I expected worse.<br />
Dinner was at Rol San, a Chinese restaurant along Spadina. Chris knew the place from his life in and around Toronto (I can only assume, otherwise he somehow managed to pick the place out of the phonebook). I was the first to arrive (no real surprise there), and began to wait for the stragglers. Chris had already told me (via voicemail) that he would be late (no real surprise there, although in due honesty, it wasn&#8217;t his fault), and that while I could look out for his friend Ellison (whom I&#8217;d never met before), he didn&#8217;t know what her hair colour would be at the time.<br />
Ellison, it seems, is no dummy. A &#8220;lonely-looking single guy sitting at a table for eight&#8221; is a dead give-away, and it took Ellison about two seconds to figure out who I was. We engaged in a long discussion about movies (Ellison is a film geek, and went through the same film program Chris took at Sheridan College) and living in Toronto vs. living in Calgary. About 45 minutes after Ellison, Chris and Natalie (whom I did know) appeared, followed shortly thereafter by Koto, one of Chris&#8217; co-workers from the Japan Foundation.<br />
The movie that night was &#8220;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&#8221;. For those of you who have been living under a rock, this is possibly the single most critically acclaimed movie of the year (I haven&#8217;t heard or read a single negative word about it). It&#8217;s likely going to be an Oscar pick (it&#8217;s already been nominated for a few Golden Globes), and rightly so &#8212; it&#8217;s got an excellent story, an excellent cast, excellent music &#8230; in short, it&#8217;s excellent. Okay, there, I&#8217;ve raved about it. Now go see it (if you haven&#8217;t already) &#8212; you can thank me later.<br />
It was the first Christmas at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s house, and it probably won&#8217;t be the last. Cathy played Santa, handing out the various gifts to those seated around. I won&#8217;t go into detail of the list (unlike last year), but I will say that I was exceptionally happy with my gifts &#8212; especially those I gave. There&#8217;s nothing like the look of surprise and joy in someone else&#8217;s face.<br />
Dinner that night was an affair not soon forgotten. Harking back to the days when my family hosted dinners having an average of 15 people in attendance, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson joined us for our meal. Yes, that is only seven people, but I wasn&#8217;t referring to the number of people &#8212; I was referring to the noise level.<br />
Cathy and Craig received &#8220;The All Canadian Trivia Game&#8221; for Christmas, and the questions became our after dinner entertainment. Being the only remotely sober person, I played Quiz Master. I was surprised at the number of times my dad answered questions that were about people and places I&#8217;d never heard of before &#8212; and I (used to) pride myself on knowing a lot of Canadiana. In fact, I found through this game that I don&#8217;t know as much as I thought I did. [Insert sound of ego deflating here.]<br />
I avoided boxing day sales at all costs &#8212; the last thing I needed was more stuff to take home with me. Instead, I spent my time eating leftovers, relaxing, watching movies, and installing my mother&#8217;s new scanner. I had hoped it would be an easy install. I really should know better by now &#8212; it took me a tech support call to UMAX to learn that I couldn&#8217;t plug the scanner into a powerbar, it needs to be plugged into the wall directly. The answer came so quickly I was surprised they didn&#8217;t have that sort of thing in the user&#8217;s guide&#8230;<br />
I also visited with another old friend (and former roommate), Ed. I met up with him and two of his friends (one of whom I knew from university) at Sega City out in Mississauga. We spent about an hour or so plugging away at the various games before we ran out of money. It was a good thing, too &#8212; the number of kids was rising at an exponential rate, and it was becoming a little too crowded for us old folks. We retreated to Jack Astor&#8217;s for beers and nachos&#8230;<br />
Next thing I knew, it was 30 December. Time to go home &#8230; Calgary, that is.<br />
Chris&#8217; parents picked me up just after 4:00 for our 7:30 flight. Yes, I know that&#8217;s early. The problem was that it had been snowing all day, and Toronto is (or at least used to be) notorious for bad traffic during that kind of weather. Figures &#8212; it was smooth driving all the way to the airport.<br />
Oh yeah, and those long line-ups I&#8217;d planned for? Non-existent. 10-minute check-in. Two hour wait for the flight. Which, of course, was delayed. (The plane we were supposed to get went out of service, probably due to a hydraulic problem, and we had to wait for another 767 to come in from Miami &#8212; it was already in transit &#8212; before we could go anywhere.) Once we&#8217;d gone through de-icing and taxiing, we&#8217;d waited for about four hours.<br />
Calgary was a zoo when we finally got in, just before midnight local time. Luggage took forever to appear, taxis were hard to get, and then to top it all off, the Calgary Police closed off Barlow Trail southbound (effectively the same as blocking off the 427 just south of the airport) for no apparent reason. After all that had happened, I just wanted to go home.<br />
We began the last day of the second millennium AD with dim sum at our favourite restaurant, followed by our ritual visit to A&amp;B Sound. We had several options on how to celebrate the turning of the year, but we settled on a video game and movie session with two friends from work. Unless the world ends tonight (little chance of that), I&#8217;ll be following up this with my annual year in review&#8230;<br />
Happy new millennium. I hope it&#8217;s better than the last one&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Whirlwind weekends. Gotta love &#8217;em&#8230;<br />
This weekend, as some of you already know, I was in Toronto. One of my friends, Jay, was getting married to his girlfriend of six years, and I was fortunate enough to witness this happy day. (More on that in a moment.)<br />
I left Friday afternoon, cutting out an hour early from work to catch the flight. It was the first time in I don&#8217;t know how long that I&#8217;d flown Air Canada, and I was a bit apprehensive. Air Canada has had a bad rap, from me at least, with their ability to process customers with any speed. They&#8217;ve changed recently, oddly enough since their merger with Canadian Airlines, and it&#8217;s been for the better. They now feature faster lines, even electronic check-in (more on that later), and people who actually smile at you. It&#8217;s a nice change.<br />
The flight out left at 6:00pm. I was in 13F &#8212; second row back from first class, inside aisle seat, starboard side. Right next to an early 20s Korean woman with her six month old child. Yeah, those chills of listening to a baby crying for four hours were firing up my spine within seconds of sitting down. It seems that my good friend Murphy missed the flight, however, the baby merely whined a little on the way up and on the way down. Cute kid.<br />
Too cute.<br />
In fact, I started thinking about having kids again. It&#8217;s been a long time since I last thought about it, even so much as devoting a passing wonder. During the flight, I started to think about all the people I knew with babies, and how I&#8217;m not one of them. I&#8217;m not exactly getting any younger, nor are my parents or my grandmother. I would like my child to know its grandparents &#8212; both of them, and its great-grandmother. I never knew either of my grandfathers &#8212; both died long before I was born. I had a step-grandfather, but I saw him only a handful of times over 24 years before he died. My lasting memory of Papa was him teaching me to skip stones on the beach in Waskesiu.<br />
So I got to thinking. What would it be like to have a child? Well, not give birth to one, but care for a child (or two), and raise it (or them) to adulthood. It&#8217;s one of those things we non-parents can only guess at, having never gone through the process. We can get hints from those who are parents, but we&#8217;ll never really know &#8212; until we&#8217;re parents.<br />
My previous few flights on Canadian Airlines led me to believe that the Canadian airline industry was going slightly downhill. I was quite happy to find, however, that Air Canada was not affected the same way. Great service, good movies (&#8220;Keeping the Faith&#8221; on the way out, &#8220;U-571&#8221; on the way back) great food (yes, I said &#8220;great&#8221; &#8212; airline food can be good, y&#8217;know), and comfortable seats. Yeah, comfortable seats sounds dumb, but if you fly enough you come to appreciate nice seats.<br />
We touched down at 11:30 EDT, arriving at the terminal some 20 minutes later. (I keep forgetting just how big Pearson International is). It was the first time in more years than I can remember that I used Terminal 2. For years, I&#8217;ve been flying out of either Terminal 1 or 3, depending on the flight. But because I avoided Air Canada, I never went into Terminal 2. It was so long that I didn&#8217;t recognize the interior at all. Well, except the baggage claim area, though I only sprinted through that &#8212; I had only carry-ons.<br />
Cathy was there to pick me up, circling the outside looking for me. (She wasn&#8217;t able to park.) Soon we were back in Oakville. We didn&#8217;t stay up long &#8212; I had to be up early for the wedding (starting at 11:00am) and Cathy was tired. So we chatted a short while before both retreating to bed.<br />
The next morning, I showered, shaved, dressed, and gathered myself for a long wedding day. (Not nearly as long as the bride and groom, but hey &#8212; I had jet lag to contend with.) This included a quick trip to my parents&#8217; house (I was staying at Cathy and Craig&#8217;s; my parents are somewhere in either Colorado or Utah &#8212; we don&#8217;t know which) to iron my shirt and borrow a pair of my dad&#8217;s dress shoes.<br />
The dress shoes were the worst part. I accidentally left my pair in Vancouver. I liked them &#8212; they were reasonably comfy. But I&#8217;m not about to go after them. That would be like reaching into a hive of African bees to get a dime. In lieu of buying a pair, my dad (who, along with my mother, were out here for a couple of weeks during their most recent excursion of the continent) suggested I borrow his.<br />
Now, my dad and I do not share bodily proportions. I&#8217;m shorter than him, by about six inches or so, and I&#8217;ve got smaller feet. A lot smaller. About a size and a half. It took five tissues per shoe and an insole to keep my feet from swimming around. They were uncomfortable and too big, but at least I didn&#8217;t attend the wedding wearing my ubiquitous sandals.<br />
Borrowing my mother&#8217;s van, I took the long route getting to the church. I wanted to be early, but I was a little too early. So I drove around to see what had changed since the last time I&#8217;d really paid attention to where I was going.<br />
I arrived about 20 minutes before the service was to begin, and already there were a large number of cars. Jay was at the front door greeting people as they arrived. Jay always has a permanent smile &#8212; he&#8217;s always happy about something. Especially when he&#8217;s trashing talking someone. But his smile was even broader than normal. He looked nearly ecstatic. He looked like a kid on Christmas morning, staring at a gigantic pile of presents under a tree.<br />
Just beyond Jay were his ushers, two of whom I knew: Stuart and Nabil. Stuart you all know, or at least have heard of. Nabil is &#8230; well, unless you&#8217;ve met him, you&#8217;re never going to understand. I might write a lot, but I can&#8217;t script a character like Nabil. Needless to say, seeing him in a tux was worth the $560 airplane ticket.<br />
I hung around the foyer a while until Matt and Alicia (I hope I got the spelling right) showed up after a few minutes. I knew them through Stuart and Jay (I met Jay through Stuart). The three of us took seats on the groom&#8217;s side four rows back from the front. It was a good thing we were there &#8212; the Corinne&#8217;s side of the church heavily outweighed Jay&#8217;s side, and most of them were family. Jay&#8217;s side seemed mostly friends, with a scattering of family for flavour.<br />
The music changed, and Jay walked down the aisle with his brother, his Best Man. Then the groomsmen came up the groom&#8217;s side, followed by the bridesmaids on the bride&#8217;s side. If Jay looked happy before, he looked like he was going to die from joy now. If his smile had gotten any wider, it would have split his head open. I looked down the aisle to see where Corrine was &#8212; her expression wasn&#8217;t much different &#8212; she was happier than I&#8217;d ever seen her.<br />
And that&#8217;s when it hit me.<br />
As you all know, I was to be married. For me, it wasn&#8217;t a joy &#8212; it was a death sentence. It was utter torture to organize, especially considering that I really didn&#8217;t want to go through with it. That, added to my pre-existing view of weddings as being an overly-extravagant ceremony wrapped around a lot of paperwork, really didn&#8217;t seed the flower of joy in weddings.<br />
Jay and Corinne changed that. Over the course of the day, I would come realize that while some people, like me, aren&#8217;t really huge fans of weddings, there are those for whom weddings are the happiest and most important day in their lives. It&#8217;s when they can say to everyone they&#8217;ve known and loved that they have found the person with whom they will spend their lives, feed, protect, covet, love, and share every moment. There is no fear, there is only happiness.<br />
I&#8217;ve only seen this kind of thing in movies. So it was a strange feeling to be watching it myself. I even found myself succumbing to the beauty in it &#8212; I actually found my eyes becoming a tad blurry. Partially from happiness, knowing that such a wonderful thing can exist, and partially from sadness, an empty feeling I periodically get when I wonder if I&#8217;ll ever be that lucky. I&#8217;m envious of such joy.<br />
I&#8217;ve known a lot of relationships in my time, and I&#8217;ve seen a lot fall apart. There are some, however, that will live (and love) a long time. Jay and Corinne are one such couple. Seeing them without smiles on their faces was (and will likely be) a rarity.<br />
Corinne&#8217;s family is Italian. Jay&#8217;s family is Irish and Italian. Hence, the wedding was Italian. Hence, Catholic. Hence, a lot of standing, sitting, kneeling, and trying not to get lost in all the activity. Matt, Alicia, and I did our best to try and keep up with everything. Stuart had a much better system: Stand when told, otherwise sit.<br />
After the wedding, we went through the receiving line, wishing the newlyweds all the best. Jay and Corinne still sported their massive smiles, which they would hold all day. I warned them that if they kept smiling like that, they&#8217;d never be able to stop.<br />
I waited outside with Stuart, Nabil, Matt, Alicia, and some of the other groomsmen, waiting for the receiving line to die out a bit. Mostly, I was waiting for Brenda and Marek to appear. They were co-workers when I was at Arkipelago in Toronto. They were my friends, whom I hadn&#8217;t seen in nearly a year. I can safely say that I miss the both of them.<br />
Soon, six of us (Brenda, Marek, Brant (another ex-Arkipelago employee, who started after me, whom I only knew by name), Matt, Alicia, and myself) broke for lunch. None of us had eaten breakfast, and the concept of going all day without food was not appealing.<br />
On a suggestion from Marek, we all went to the Dundas Street Grill, on Dundas around Kipling. We ate too much. We were still hungry, but we ate too much. We knew that there was going to be a bombardment of food at the reception, and it dawned on me (and certainly the others) that we were going to look like we&#8217;d been to taxidermists after the reception that evening.<br />
After lunch, we broke into two squads: Marek, Brenda, and Brant went off in search of fortune and glory, while Matt, Alicia, and I tried to navigate all the detours and closed exits to get to a lone two-bedroom apartment in High Park. There we hung out for the remainder of time until we had to go to the reception. Alicia and I watched &#8220;Leon&#8221; (aka &#8220;The Professional&#8221;) while Matt napped &#8212; he and Nabil had been out drinking until 4:00am the previous night.<br />
Two of Matt&#8217;s (and presumably, Jay&#8217;s) friends were going to catch a ride with us. So we waited around until they arrived. At 5:15. The reception was at 5:30. At Finch and the 427, about 30-40 kilometres away. We were there by 5:50.<br />
The reception was at a place called Pantone&#8217;s (or something like that), what some people referred to as a &#8220;wedding factory&#8221;. It&#8217;s basically a light industrial building converted into two massive reception halls, separated by (presumably) a massive kitchen. Each of the halls has a lobby where all 200+ guests were crammed in. We did another reception line, met all the wedding party as we worked our way around, got our seats, and signed our names.<br />
Marek, Brenda, Brant, and I were assigned to Table #22 &#8212; the current and ex-co-workers table. The last table. But also one of the best tables &#8212; we were right next to the bar. Given, there was a pillar in my view that blocked a bit of the head table, but I spent most of my time talking to Brant, Brenda, and Marek, and listening to Marek&#8217;s stories. (Did I mention that miss working with Brenda and Marek?)<br />
This was my first experience with an Italian wedding. Also my first with an Italian reception. Not quite a full-bore Italian reception (I&#8217;ve heard of much bigger, though Chris tells me Chinese receptions even outdo Italian receptions), but it was still bigger than all the others I&#8217;d been to.<br />
Dinner came in five courses. First was buns. Okay, they&#8217;re not a course, but we all dug into the buns before anything else. Then came the appetizer: grilled vegetables with goat cheese, olives (no, I didn&#8217;t eat the olives), and a prociutto-wrapped raw fig. The fig was a little odd (never had one), but it was still good. Round Two was the pasta: tortellini and something that looked like the pasta equivalent of a Swiss roll. Dunno what it was called, but boy, was it good. Round Three was the chicken, breaded veal, and roasted vegetables. (Marek called the veal about five minutes before it was served.) By this point, the four of us were undoing buttons and breathing lightly, so&#8217;s not to have our chests burst. Then came Round Four: seafood and salad. I refrained from the seafood, not for a lack of wanting it (except maybe the lobster), but did accept the salad. We were all dreading what culinary wonder we would have to suffer through next when a small brown sphere appeared on our plates: Tartuffe. (I think Marek called that one too, though it might have been Brant.)<br />
You don&#8217;t refuse Tartuffe &#8212; that&#8217;s just sacrilegious.<br />
The First Dance had actually been before dinner, something that was new to me. The dancing resumed after dinner with the other traditional dances: Father with daughter, mother with son, groomsmen with bridesmaids. I sat and watched it all. (Aside from the fact that I&#8217;m not a big dancer, my dad&#8217;s shoes were shredding the tops of my feet, making even sitting a chore.) Then things started getting silly.<br />
The MC (I don&#8217;t know if he was an employee of the establishment, or if Jay and Corinne hired him and the DJ) got people to do silly things. That seems to be a trend at weddings. On such silly thing was having Jay and Corinne each start &#8220;trains&#8221;. Jay went around picking up all the women, while Corinne went around picking up all the men. (I think that if I ever get married, the only thing anyone will be picking up is something more to drink.) I did not join in, as my feet were now beginning to consider a rebellion and secede from the rest of my body.<br />
The party went on until around 11:00, at which point a lot of people started to leave. Stuart and I (I was driving Stuart home) ducked out around 11:30 or so, after both of us came to the conclusion that we were too tired to go on. Jay and Corinne, however, were still going strong, and still had the massive smiles on their faces. Like I said, I&#8217;m envious of such happiness. (Although, it could have been that their faces had in fact been stuck in that position.)<br />
I awoke late the next day to the smell of bacon. (I still say that it is genetically impossible for me to sleep through the smell of cooking bacon.) Cathy and Craig were already up and about, doing whatever it is that they do on weekends. We ate a leisurely brunch &#8230; ah, heck, it was even past lunch by the time we actually ate, even if it was eggs, bacon, and hash browns. By the time I got myself up and running, it was nearly 2:00pm. Taking some time, I tried to call two friends of mine in Toronto: Kathryn and Ed. (They don&#8217;t live with each other, they don&#8217;t even know each other &#8212; but I had said I would try to get a hold of them while I was in. No, I wasn&#8217;t shunning anyone else, just that the topic that I would be in town came up in emails with them.)<br />
Couldn&#8217;t find Ed. (Ed &#8212; check your 411 entry, eh?) Kathryn took a bit, but I managed to corner her at her place in Toronto. Being occupied, I had to restrict myself to a phone call instead of a proper visit. Afterwards I called Stuart to let him know that we wouldn&#8217;t be seeing Kathryn that day. Stuart invited me to join him on his mission to return the rented tux.<br />
Square One was as busy as I remembered. It had been a very long time since the last time I&#8217;d been in Square One, but it didn&#8217;t look all that different. No further than 100 metres into the mall, we ran into Jay and Corinne. They looked a little more rested than the day before, but the smiles were still there. (I know envy&#8217;s one of the Seven Deadly Sins, but sometimes it&#8217;s just hard to ignore&#8230;)<br />
The rest of the afternoon vanished quickly. Stuart and I went in search of a Slurpee or Froster, only to find the nearest one to where our parents live in Oakville is at a Mac&#8217;s (aka Mac&#8217;s Milk) next to the old Loblaws store downtown. During our search, we found ourselves noting what stores in downtown Oakville used to be something else. (A sure sign that you&#8217;re getting old.) We were almost shocked to realize that downtown Oakville, at least along Lakeshore, isn&#8217;t much different than Banff (Bamf!).<br />
Terminal 2 has taken a few cues from Terminal 3, and Air Canada has gone long ways to try and streamline passenger check-in. One such is the introduction of Express terminals. You feed in your credit card or Aerocard, punch in your flight number, select your seat (I missed that), and bam &#8212; out comes your boarding pass. Very convenient, and really nice if all you have is carry-on. (Even if you have actual baggage, there&#8217;s an Express baggage check-in after you&#8217;ve got your boarding pass.)<br />
No aisle. I was wedged between two people. Not entirely comfortable, but at least it would get me home. It was a quiet flight &#8212; most of the people around me slept. Especially the guy on the window seat. I had a sneaky suspicion he was returning from a trip to Europe (he had brochures, maps, and bits of literature from European attractions), and was dead tired. He slept nearly the entire trip.<br />
This was not a cheap excursion for me, and I had for a while debated on not going. However, one night as I lay in bed, counting the number of streetlights reflecting on my ceiling, I made a decision. Last year, I missed the weddings of some dear friends: Ed (one of my roommates from university) and his wife Jen, and Marek and Brenda. I missed them because I was told I didn&#8217;t have enough money to afford it. (I need not mention who told that to me.) I sincerely wished I had gone. Those were days I wished I hadn&#8217;t missed. Hopefully, I won&#8217;t miss any more.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is a hard-working company. And Ted (our founder and corporate Chairman) knows it. To &#8220;thank&#8221; us for all the grief he puts us through, he closes (more or less) the office for two days, packs us off to some remote part of the country, and gets us all horribly drunk &#8212; and he pays for everything. It might be good to be king, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to be a peasant every once in a while.<br />
Critical Mass starts planning &#8220;The Trip&#8221;, as it&#8217;s usually referred to, about four months early. It&#8217;s a fairly involved excursion, and when you consider the attendance (at least this year) is about 300 people, there&#8217;s a fair bit of coordination involved. We have two people who work on it nearly full-time, in addition to their regular jobs. And then there&#8217;s a team of about 10 people (representing the various departments in the company) who help in the decision making for things such as, well, the beer labels.<br />
Yes, beer labels. This was something I participated in. We had a beer label competition. If you buy enough beer from the Big Rock Brewery here in Calgary, you can make your own special labels for the event. When I first heard about the opportunity to see if I could out-design the Design department, I leapt a the chance. I came in second. Behind Adrian. A guy who works in Design. Oh well, maybe next year.<br />
We arrived at Critical Mass on Thursday morning with bags in hand, ready for the nine-odd hour trip to Westbank, British Columbia. (For those of you who&#8217;ve never heard of Westbank, it&#8217;s a little south of Kelowna, on the east side of Lake Okanagan.) Luckily, we were not taking school busses (I can only imaging the agony of sitting in those for more than three hours at a time) &#8212; were taking Greyhound.<br />
The busses started arriving around 8:00am. We were told they would arrive at 7:30am. This was a tactic to make sure we all were there on time. As it stands, the fourth (and last) bus didn&#8217;t arrive until nearly 8:45, and we didn&#8217;t leave until nearly 9:00 (despite the threatened 8:30 departure time). Again, all of this was planned with an iota of experience &#8212; I assume they had problems last year, and figured it would be worse this time around.<br />
Luckily, our Greyhound busses came equipped with all the modern conveniences: Reclining seats, air conditioning, and a VCR with two TVs. That meant movies. And what better movies to travel with than the Indiana Jones trilogy? Well, if you&#8217;re Mike (on of my co-workers, and a huge fan of independent films), it also includes &#8220;Waiting for Guffman&#8221;. Mike, it seems, was the only one really interested in it. I would have preferred to see &#8220;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&#8221; instead, which was bumped when Mike beat us to the VCR.<br />
We made three stops along the way &#8212; a quick one at some rest stop, one at Golden for lunch, and a third one in some rinky-dink place north of Vernon so all the smokers on the busses wouldn&#8217;t shake it apart from nic-fits. Every time we had a stop, Pat (whom we labelled &#8220;Bus Masta P&#8221; &#8212; he was in charge of all the busses) got stressed out trying to keep everyone on schedule by getting them back on. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll willingly do that again next year.<br />
We arrived at the Cove Resort around 5:30pm PDT. Now, before you get all &#8220;oooh, a resort!&#8221;, this is at best a word that would describe the long-term plans. There&#8217;s no shuffleboard, no sailboats, no beach &#8212; not even anything remotely resembling a restaurant. It&#8217;s an old farm converted to 26 cabins and a small motel-like building. My cabin, in fact, used to be the farm house. Even all those cabins couldn&#8217;t house our bulk &#8212; we needed the large field to accommodate an additional 20 or so tents.<br />
There were no real plans that evening, aside from getting settled (which took a while &#8212; we had a lot of stuff to unload from the busses), eat (which we did, around 7:00 that evening), drink (which we did in abundance), and relax (which came after the aforementioned drinking). Many of us congregated at Cabin #6, home of the Conners Brothers and Colin &#8212; a perfect recipe for trouble, especially when four tenters were regularly crashing on the cabin floor rather than sleeping outside. Cabin #6 became legend by the following morning.<br />
I didn&#8217;t rise until nearly 1pm, opting to catch up on a lot of sleep. The day was warm and sunny, and people were milling about. I headed to the main tent, where I hoped lunch was being served (I didn&#8217;t really know what time it was, I didn&#8217;t know for most of the weekend). I was in luck &#8212; lunch was slowly beginning to end, and snatching up a meal was as simple as walking up to the table and taking whatever I wanted.<br />
The day was slow and lazy &#8212; the way a day should be. Others went off in search of amenities such as McDonald&#8217;s and Starbucks. I went off in search of things I could watch. I opted not to actually participate in anything, trying not to do anything physically active at all. (This was a conscious decision &#8230; it came right after I realized I&#8217;d forgotten my swimsuit.) There were plenty of things for me to watch &#8212; people were playing sports all over the place, including horseshoes, bocce, volleyball, soccer, and touch football.<br />
The &#8220;major&#8221; event of the day was the wakeboarding demonstration. Ted (who lives barely five minutes from the Resort) is basically a big kid, and is always looking for new toys and things to do. (This is why we also had a houseboat that would take us on short rides on the lake, and Ted took extreme pleasure in whipping people around in his new super-fast powerboat.) Ted hired professional wakeboarders (some of whom had placed as high as fifth in Wakestock, the wakeboarding championships) to not only show us what they could do, but teach others to do it as well.<br />
The demonstration sucked.<br />
Okay, to be fair, they were good. The only problem was that their best demonstration was nearly half a kilometre away, and nearly impossible to see. Our cheering could be best described as &#8220;reserved&#8221;.<br />
Hamburgers were on the menu that night. We were lucky &#8212; our meals were provided by a catering company (who did an excellent job). Last year, those who went on the trip were preparing their own meals. Relaxation is much easier when you only need to show up and eat.<br />
Entertainment for the first night in Westbank was courtesy of several &#8220;amateur&#8221; (though they certainly sound professional) DJs who work in various parts of the company. The second night&#8217;s entertainment was also musical, but certainly more &#8230; interesting.<br />
Karaoke.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;You did karaoke??&#8221; Well, *I* didn&#8217;t do karaoke, but just about everyone else did. Why didn&#8217;t I? Aside from a terminal case of stage fright, I also happen to be extremely self-conscious about my inability to sing. Hey, when you take a jab at yourself in front of your friends (such as &#8220;I sing horribly&#8221;), and they don&#8217;t respond the way friends normally do (such as &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not *that* bad&#8221;), you know you suck.<br />
Mike (the guy with the independent film fetish) was anxious to get on stage and show his stuff. (Mike&#8217;s a little weird.) He wasn&#8217;t the first on stage. That was Geoff Mackenzie.<br />
Geoff&#8217;s a character. (Must be in the name.) He was dressed in jeans (pants and jacket), a somewhat-loud cowboy-like shirt, and a corduroy cowboy hat. The first song of the evening was &#8220;Stand By Your Man&#8221;. And no, he didn&#8217;t change the lyrics one bit. Geoff&#8217;s performance (with heavy doses of ham) set the tone for the evening, and it went downhill from there.<br />
Chris (my roommate, friend, and fellow troublemaker) was up shortly after Geoff. Chris erupted onto the stage with an opening that went somewhat like this: &#8220;Aight, they didn&#8217;t have any NWA, so instead, this one goes out to all my Critical Mass niggaz and all my Critical Mass shortys. Let&#8217;s roll up on this motherf***er&#8230;&#8221; He did Lionel Ritchie&#8217;s &#8220;Easy (Like Sunday Morning)&#8221;. With audience participation. Shannon, another of my co-workers who knows Chris, was sitting on the balcony outside his motel room (there was a motel-like building that housed another six rooms of people) was duly impressed with Chris&#8217; performance. It led to a return to the stage for a duet with Rob (who&#8217;s in Design, I think) to do &#8220;Ebony and Ivory&#8221;. Rob and Chris lapped up the audience&#8217;s appreciation.<br />
During a needed sprint back to my cabin (bathroom break), I missed the opening of one of the headlining acts for the night: Ted and Dewi. They brought their own music (they figured the karaoke company wouldn&#8217;t have the song they wanted to do) &#8212; Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;Larger Than Life&#8221;. Only they had help &#8212; four others who did the now-famous chair dance while Ted and Dewi crooned. (I should point out that this was not only set up well in advance, but the chair dancers practiced their moves before strutting their stuff in public.) The audience might as well have been from an actual Backstreet Boys concert from the amount of screaming and cheering&#8230;<br />
Geoff came back for another round of fun, performing that Johnny Cash classic, &#8220;Ring of Fire&#8221;. You&#8217;d never think so many people would be so into karaoke. I guess it all depends on who&#8217;s up performing. I think I have a whole new appreciation for that brand of entertainment. For example, we staged the first ever Tiffany mosh pit when two singing souls (Steve and Andrew) did their rendition of &#8220;I Think We&#8217;re Alone Now&#8221;. It was a sign of things to come.<br />
Anyway, Geoff stole the show again, and then managed to get everyone in the tent to break a few hundred noise by-laws by screaming at the top of their lungs. I think my Aunt Alaine and Uncle David (who live on the other side of the lake) could probably have heard us that evening. Luckily, the cops never showed up.<br />
The fight for the limelight also included Shawn Conners (one of the Conners Brothers). Shawn is about as perfect a specimen of a (pardon the language) &#8220;shit disturber&#8221; as I have ever met. He is also an artiste (note the extra &#8216;e&#8217;) and the biggest honey-glazed ham I have ever had the pleasure to have known. He and Colin did a great version of Milli Vanilli&#8217;s &#8220;Blame It On The Rain&#8221;. But Shawn wasn&#8217;t content with a simple singing version &#8212; he had to go that one step further and dump a bottle of water on himself (very much like in &#8220;Flashdance&#8221; &#8212; I still think they should have been doing &#8220;What A Feeling&#8221;) while striking an overly-dramatic pose.<br />
I made a hasty departure when Dave and his posse started singing &#8220;American Pie&#8221;. Keith&#8217;s a great singer, but it was a riot just waiting to happen. I hung out at the fire pit for a while, talking with some of the people who had fled the chaos, before retreating to Cabin #6 sometime around 1am, after the karaoke had broken down into a rave.<br />
I woke earlier the next morning and found my way to the big tent, where others were waiting for lunch. Breakfast had just ended, but I didn&#8217;t miss anything (muffins and fruit salad every morning were not enough of a reason for me to get up early). Lunch that day were smokies, and the tent was packed with hungry people waiting to eat.<br />
The afternoon was relaxed again. Some people slept, many others disappeared into town again, in search of amenities. Several went to see &#8220;X-Men&#8221; playing at the local cheapie theatre. I wandered around, talked with people, watched others try to wakeboard, sat around the campfire (which I think never went out from the moment it was lit), and watched others play cards.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t bored. Boredom comes when you want to do something, but are unable to determine what it is you want to do. I was trying to avoid activity. I was letting my mind turn to mush for a while. By purposely not thinking or doing anything, I was letting myself relax. I haven&#8217;t done it in a very long time, and it was hugely relaxing.<br />
One thing that required the use of my brain somewhat was reading the paper. Someone had left a copy of the Vancouver Sun on the table in my cabin, and I figured I&#8217;d see what was going down in the Lower Mainland. Aside from a massive sewer rupture spilling millions of litres of untreated sewage into Burrard Inlet, it seemed that not much had changed since I left &#8212; same political name-calling, same sports successes, and school was back in session (you know it&#8217;s a slow news day when&#8230;) It was very comforting to read a newspaper &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t read one since I was staying at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s here in Calgary.<br />
The weather wasn&#8217;t cooperating one bit. While the previous day had been nice (although the night had been quite cold), we had bursts of rain for most of the day. Although right before dinner, we found ourselves gazing at the largest and most vivid double-rainbow I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve never seen a complete rainbow before, either &#8212; usually the top or either end is missing, but this one was a complete 180-degree arc. It was awe-inspiring. The joke that immediately followed was a query about how much Ted paid to have a rainbow appear before dinner.<br />
Our last supper in Westbank was steak and salmon, with baked potatoes and Caesar salad. Those of us who could, pigged out. Aside from the bones, it was great. (Although we apparently ran out of salmon, and I feel a little guilty for getting as much as I did. Only a little &#8212; it was Pacific salmon, after all.)<br />
Dessert was a special one that night. It was Ted&#8217;s birthday, and we had three cakes to spread around. Two of the cakes bore our Critical Mass propaganda logo, the third bore a relief sculpture of a caricature of Ted&#8217;s face. In icing. It was beautiful &#8230; and the artist (Mark Gervais) didn&#8217;t get fired for it.<br />
It was Caribbean night. This meant loud polyester shirts, shorts, and lots and lots and lots and lots of booze. (We went through between 9,000 and 13,000 pounds of booze in the weekend.) The Caribbean music (although good), lasted only long enough to get Ted (who was a little past plastered) to take a few swings at a piÃ±ata. Then the DJs got back into their swing, and the rave got going again. This was probably the most intense it had been since we got there, but most people realized that this was their last night to really let loose. And most of them did.<br />
Not being a dancer, nor finding anything else to do at that point, I found myself back at the fire pit again. Our group of six (comprising nearly every level and department in the company) engaged in hearty conversation. Our numbers soon swelled, when Ted arrived. (Wherever Ted goes, people go. It&#8217;s either an Einsteinian thing where people flow to the gravity well formed by Ted&#8217;s immense power, or they&#8217;re drawn like moths to candle flames. Either way, we soon had a lot of people.<br />
Ted was a little dismayed to find it was only 10:50. He had hoped it was 12:50. He wanted to go home, but thought it would be &#8230; well, wimpy of him to leave before 1am. Ted was wiped &#8212; the day had really taken a dent out of him, and he had two more hours to survive. Soon, there were about 50 people around the fire, and I&#8217;d lost my seat.<br />
Around midnight, the Rave Revolt began. First it started with Ted commenting that they&#8217;d played the same song for over three hours. Dan went over to &#8220;correct&#8221; the problem. He reported back (sans a change in music) saying Dewi protested, offering a change after &#8220;the first set&#8221;. Some of the more &#8220;senior&#8221; people (those over the age of 35) didn&#8217;t much like this answer. Ted decided it was time for action, and walked back towards the tent, muttering something about &#8220;Christmas bonuses&#8221;. A few minutes later, lyrics returned to the music, and the beat was noticeably different.<br />
It&#8217;s something that I think the older folk don&#8217;t quite understand. Rave music is meant to have a single beat that lasts for hours. It&#8217;s a challenge to keep the beat while changing the songs. The beat, although important, isn&#8217;t everything &#8212; melodies change, different layers of sound are woven in and out, even some lyrics thrown in for good measure. But it&#8217;s a sign of a skilled DJ who can make several hours of music sound like one song.<br />
By about 2:30 in the morning, there were only nine: Chris, myself, Ben, Adrian, Virgil, Mike (different Mike), Teak, Simone, and Marcie. We talked. All night. Our first major topic of conversations was 80s TV themes. Ben is the King of 80s TV. He knows the themes from virtually every TV show that aired from 1979 to 1991, except the really obscure ones like Automan, Manimal, Outlaws, and The Highwayman (bonus points to you if you a) even remember what they were, and double points if b) you can describe them.)<br />
Marcie and Simone left shortly before we finished that topic, saying &#8220;it&#8217;s time for bed&#8221;. Adrian suggested we do movie quotes &#8212; you give the quote, and the rest had to guess it. Chris and I had a decided advantage, having a) watched about a billion movies, and b) spent a great deal of time memorizing lines. For everyone who thought we were wasting our time, I offer you the fruits of our labour. Of course, Chris and I were always telling each other not to speak up, because we knew that the other would know the quote.<br />
Yeah, yeah, we act like we&#8217;re married. Like we haven&#8217;t heard that a thousand times before. It doesn&#8217;t help that we&#8217;ve been good friends for 13 years.<br />
Somewhere around 3:30am, Simone and Marcie returned to our circle, not having made it to bed. They&#8217;d been distracted by another social gathering elsewhere (assumedly not one as geeky as ours), but instead of going to bed when it broke up, they came back to us. (So I guess we&#8217;re not that geeky. No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
Somewhere around 4:00am or so, it began to rain. A lot. It was the sort of rain you knew would get you utterly soaked. And with the wind picking up, it was going to get us cold very quickly. We retreated to the big tent. We flipped on the lights, cranked up the heater, and returned to our little games. Ben bailed on us about 30 minutes later, leaving just the Group of Eight.<br />
When morning finally arrived, we started the process of getting ready to leave. Chris and I showered, packed, and hauled our stuff out to the Resort office porch, awaiting arrival of the busses. We then ate breakfast (muffins and fruit salad) and watched the sun come up. Figures that the day we leave good weather returns to Westbank.<br />
When the busses showed up, people started jumping on them. That started trouble. People (in general) are stupid. People don&#8217;t think about big pictures, what needs to be done, bla bla bla. That&#8217;s why we have visionaries. And anal retentive busy-bodies. (They&#8217;re often one-in-the-same, but that&#8217;s another long essay.) This is when I called upon the bus leaders to get their acts in gear, or we weren&#8217;t getting all the sound equipment, leftovers, and tents onto the busses.<br />
Chrissie (now the designated Bus Master), quickly knighted me and gave me the power to order others around. Holding everyone else back, we loaded our leftovers and whatnot onto the busses before letting everyone else suck up the rest of the space with their belongings. Packing took about 30 minutes.<br />
Chris was nowhere in sight. Having made mention to it earlier in the day (or later in the night before, take your choice), he had probably grabbed a seat with Marcie. (I would find out I was right after our first stop in Revelstoke.) I was seated behind Yasmin, one of our new people &#8212; she&#8217;s an Information Architect, and in front of Rich, one of our Project Managers. Along with most of the bus, we slept most of the way back to Calgary.<br />
We watched three movies: &#8220;Dumb and Dumber&#8221;, &#8220;Big Trouble In Little China&#8221;, and part of &#8220;True Lies&#8221;. When I was awake, I wasn&#8217;t watching the movies most of the time &#8212; I was watching the scenery. The day was so bright, and I wasn&#8217;t driving, that I got my first really good look at the sights to be seen in the mountains. There were a few times that I wished I could have stopped the bus just so I could look around.<br />
Arriving in Calgary, chaos ensued when we unloaded. But soon Chris and I were safe and sound at home. Overall, it was a great weekend, except for the 18 hours spent on the road. Those were a little more tedious. But I can think of worse things &#8212; 18 hours across the Prairies, for example.<br />
This morning, people were tired, foggy, semi-unconcious &#8212; basically everything you&#8217;d expect from such a weekend. Productivity will take a day or two to get back to normal. Whatever normal is&#8230;<br />
One last note: It was minus one this morning as I walked to work. The shorts are gone, the fleece is out, and the sandals are bare moments from being packed away. Summer is definitely over.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Owing to a very hectic week, I really haven&#8217;t had a chance to get to this one. Hopefully my workload will drop a bit in the not-too-distant future so I can return to the simpler things in life &#8230; like writing eight-page emails that I know you all love so much.<br />
Cathy and Craig were due to come out and visit and see the Great Province of Alberta. Neither had taken any vacation time in a while, and both needed it badly. Despite an impending launch for the new version of our largest client&#8217;s website, I took two days on Monday and Tuesday so that I could spend some time with my sister and (pseudo-)brother-in-law. This (supposedly) was not a problem &#8230; would find out after my return that taking vacation around a launch date of our largest client&#8217;s website is not a good idea&#8230;<br />
I arrived at the airport to meet them. Originally, the flight was to arrive around 6:30pm, but owing to a &#8220;mechanical problem&#8221; with their plane, the flight was delayed until 9:30pm. I&#8217;m still amazed at the things I could find to do in the airport for two hours.<br />
As I waited for Cathy and Craig, I began to notice that the Calgary Stampede must be close &#8230; there were an untold number of people wandering around in western garb, or at least with cowboy hats. (And no, this is not the sort of thing you see in Calgary on a regular basis.)<br />
Their flight in, we collected their bags, collected their rental car, and headed over to my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s. They (and my Nana, who was also there) wanted to see them. Besides, we needed our tickets to the Stampede. Yes, we were going. I&#8217;d never been and wanted to see what all the hype was about. I assume Cathy and Craig wanted to go for a similar reason.<br />
We were late leaving &#8212; about 11:30 or so &#8212; and didn&#8217;t get to bed until well after midnight. We were up the next morning at 6:30. It was the first morning of the Calgary Stampede, and it was also parade day. Every year, there&#8217;s a massive (and I mean massive &#8212; it&#8217;s the largest parade I&#8217;ve ever seen) through downtown of horses, marching bands, floats, quasi-important people, local (and not-so-local) Native peoples, and a lot of street sweepers. Those horses aren&#8217;t exactly toilet-trained, y&#8217;know&#8230;<br />
We were informed that we should get seats early. Many people had already beaten us to the punch, and had chairs set up at the side of the road. We sat on one of the creosote-soaked railway ties that made up one of the &#8220;gardens&#8221; along the south side of 9th Ave.<br />
The parade is popular. I think about half of Alberta turns out for it. I&#8217;ve seen parades where people line up to see things pass &#8212; you can usually wiggle yourself into the line to see. Not here. If you didn&#8217;t have a seat, you weren&#8217;t getting in. And that was on 9th &#8230; I&#8217;d hate to see what 6th Ave was like. Utter mayhem, I guess&#8230;<br />
The parade featured, as I said, people from all walks of life and all facets of the Stampede. And about a hundred marching bands. (There&#8217;s a competition at the Stampede every year.) The bands came from far and wide, including Minnesota (about four or five bands were from there), California, Alberta (of course), British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, and even Tongo. I didn&#8217;t even know Tongo had musical instruments, let alone a marching band! And a good one, at that!<br />
We ducked out before the parade was over. I had to go to work (unlike most of Calgary). Cathy and Craig took the opportunity to go find a pub. I directed them to Ceili&#8217;s (&#8220;Cayley&#8217;s&#8221;), down the street from where we live. We would meet up with them that night at the Stampede.<br />
Chris and I arrived at the Stampede grounds that night around 7:30. Picture the CNE (or PNE) grounds. Same general idea &#8230; with two or three times the number of people per square metre. It was complete chaos. It was the Calgary Stampede.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain what the Stampede means to this city unless you&#8217;ve been here to experience it. Nearly two months ago, the city started gearing up for it. Windows of shops and companies started receiving paint jobs &#8212; cartoonish cowboys, horses, cows, and western scenes. Light posts along nearly every major road in Calgary starting flying the Stampede banner. Advertising was prominent as far back as a month ago. Three weeks ago some companies started promoting Stampede events (the ubiquitous Stampede Breakfasts). Two weeks ago, the decorations went up. These involved whole trees cut into 1-2 inch thick planks, bark and all. These are nailed together to create the kitschy western &#8220;feel&#8221; of Stampede. Nearly every restaurant puts this stuff up.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the people. Everyone who is somewhat serious about this stuff pulls out the jeans, western shirts, cowboy boots, and cowboy hats. (There&#8217;s a rumour of a little-known Calgary law that states you must have enough cowboy hats in each home for everyone currently living there.)<br />
The grounds were complete packed. Chris and I had to struggle (somewhat) to find our way. Our ultimate destination was the Grandstand, where we would meet up with everyone else. We got sidetracked by the Nokia PowerXone. I thought it was going to be a cool product exposition. It was in fact a large building with lots of open space, and a few stalls operated by local companies. I don&#8217;t think Nokia was even there&#8230; The only cool this was a full-size video dancing game, operated by two players who knew it so well they could dance while playing.<br />
The Grandstand is big &#8212; no-one seems to know how long it&#8217;s been there, but it&#8217;s a mainstay at the Stampede. While most of the Stampede is not unlike the CNE or the PNE (save for the abundant Bullseye BBQ Beef on a Bun stands), the Grandstand is the bastion of the time-honoured traditions: The rodeo and the Chriswagon races.<br />
We&#8217;d missed the rodeo (on earlier in the afternoon), but we were going to see the Chriswagon races and the &#8220;Grandstand Show&#8221;, whatever that was. After climbing almost all the way to the top (Aunt Brenda got us seats nearly at the top, which turned out to be an excellent vantage point to see everything at the races), we ran into my Aunt, Uncle, Jen (cousin), Cathy, and Craig.<br />
While most of us looked &#8220;normal&#8221; (in the sense that in any other major city in North America at that point, we would be indistinguishable from anyone else), Uncle Mike had dusted off his cowboy clothes. Although he played it down a bit by leaving the hat at home. At least one of us was playing cowboy.<br />
We found our way to our seats and watched the spectacle unfold. The Chriswagon races have evolved a bit to stay with the times. Originally, they were real Chriswagons, with real cast-iron stoves. Then a few too many horses and riders were getting killed, and many an outrider was throwing their back out trying to load the heavy stove. As with most competitive sports, things changed.<br />
Today, the wagons are wagon-like, but smaller and more compact. The stove is now a small red barrel (assumedly with some weight to it). The races are limited to four Chriss, and four teams of outriders. (Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get to the description in a moment.) The races are probably faster than they were before, and accidents less (although people do still get injured and killed).<br />
The races are fairly simple. There are four teams: one Chriswagon (pulled by four horses) with one driver, and four &#8220;outriders&#8221; each with a horse. All four teams start lined up at four sets of barrels; one outrider holds the team in place, the other three poised to load the &#8220;tent&#8221; and &#8220;stove&#8221; into the wagon. The barrels are arranged in a 1/6 of a circle, with a second set of barrels about one Chriswagon length away from that.<br />
At the horn, the three rear outriders throw the contents in, and the fourth lets go of the team. The Chriswagons are actually pointed away from the race direction. They race from the first barrel, around the second (some cars don&#8217;t turn that tightly), and then charge towards the actual racetrack. It&#8217;s usually pretty close. The outriders then have to hop onto their horses and sprint after the Chriswagons. They can&#8217;t get ahead of their wagon, but they can&#8217;t fall behind it either. The outriders are pretty useless, actually, aside from loading the wagons. (In fact, outriders are recycled across all the races, and are independent of the drivers.) The race is one lap &#8212; first one to the end, without penalty, usually wins.<br />
It&#8217;s rather amazing how much some people can get into this sort of thing. You&#8217;d think: &#8220;They&#8217;re wagons. Racing around a track. Whoopee.&#8221; Chris thought that. He got into it &#8212; he actually found himself cheering for the drivers. It&#8217;s crazy.<br />
Even crazier is the sponsoring. Chriswagon racing is big in these here parts. So much so, companies put down as much as $165,000 just to have the cover of the Chriswagon bear their logo. (Aunt Brenda tells me that this is down from years past. I wonder what the prices used to go for?)<br />
There were nine heats of racing, after which there was a short intermission where the Skyhawks flew into the Grandstand. (You may remember them from [[BC Rail Royal Hudson 2860, West Coast Railway Association, Comox Airshow, and Skyhawks]].) This was their second flight of the day, after a somewhat disastrous first flight (one of the parachuters missed their mark and collided with an ambulance &#8230; at least they hit the one thing they needed the most). Shortly after, they hauled out the stage.<br />
This was the first year for this new stage. It&#8217;s big. It needs the biggest farm tractor they could find to move it into place. But after only a few minutes of tweaking, it&#8217;s ready for use. And so began the Grandstand Show.<br />
The best analogy is if you took a Vegas show and put it outdoors. In fact, they go so far as to call the show &#8220;The Best Show in the Great Outdoors&#8221;, or something like that. It&#8217;s not a claim they make lightly, nor is does it falls short of the claim. It&#8217;s pretty impressive, even if the most famous person is Tom Jackson (of North of 60). Admittedly, he does have a very cool voice, which came into play in the show&#8217;s finale.<br />
The show started off with the singing of the National Anthem &#8230; by a three-year old girl. There&#8217;s no physical way a three-year old should be able to sing that well. Especially when I can&#8217;t. She had it all memorized, although she paused a while in between verses, either to remember the next line or out of fear. It&#8217;s not easy getting in front of 10,000-odd people and perform flawlessly.<br />
The entertainment consisted of the Young Canadians (a 100,000-person singing and dancing troupe), some soul singer I&#8217;d never heard of (although he was all the way from New York, so assumedly he couldn&#8217;t have been *that* bad), a juggler (one of the better ones I&#8217;ve seen), a not-so-good comedian all the way from Saskatchewan (whose jokes mostly revolved around Saskatchewan and speaking French), and of course, Tom Jackson.<br />
Stuart had warned us of the &#8220;Young Canadians&#8221;, alluding them to be like the &#8220;Duff Singers&#8221; on &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221;. Thankfully, we were not subjected to such torture. Although they were slightly too cutesy, it wasn&#8217;t too bad. There was no way to count the exact number of them, because they were all over the place. Excellent choreography, I have to say &#8212; much better than I&#8217;ve seen in other live shows.<br />
The evening ended with a telling of the dreamcatcher fable from Native lore. It was an impressive show that I found really interesting &#8230; and that was without the fireworks going off all over the place. I never thought you could work pyrotechnics into a show that wasn&#8217;t featuring loud music, but apparently you can.<br />
Oh yeah, I should also mention the beer. Budweiser seems to be the supplier for all the beer at the Stampede (oh, how can I contain my joy?) &#8212; I think Cathy, Craig, and Uncle Mike tried their best to take a dent out of that supply. The three of them, especially Craig and Mike, were utter wrecks by the end of the evening. It didn&#8217;t help that Cathy and Craig still hadn&#8217;t adjusted to the time zone, so were in considerably worse condition.<br />
I won&#8217;t mention the &#8220;serving wenches&#8221;. Okay, I just did, but it&#8217;s an inside joke that only those who were there will get&#8230;<br />
At first, the general consensus was to go home. However, Jen decided that she was dragging someone on a ride, even if it killed them. I was game, I have to say that. HOWEVER, Cathy was pleading to go to bed. So I refused. So Jen got Craig to go. Cathy apparently was unable to stop him.<br />
We didn&#8217;t actually get out of the grounds until after 1am. This was partly because every time we tried to get everyone together, half of them disappeared. Cathy, Craig, and Uncle Mike were still loopy by the time we got to the C-Train station. [More references to &#8220;serving wenches&#8221; go here.]<br />
No-one (in either household) rose early the next morning. Although I wanted to drag Cathy and Craig out to dim sum, they were &#8230; how shall I put this? &#8230; not well. There was only one solution to their problem &#8212; breakfast at Dunn&#8217;s.<br />
Dunn&#8217;s Famous Delicatessen was a mainstay in Ottawa for years. Chris and Gerry used to frequent it at all hours of the day (and night) when they were in school. Cathy and her friends lived with one of the chefs, so had an open door policy (not that the place ever closed). It was a sad day when Dunn&#8217;s (in the Market) closed. I have many fond memories of eating breakfast at any time during the day (I love all-day breakfasts) at Dunn&#8217;s in the Market. I miss it. There&#8217;s still one on Bank Street, but it&#8217;s just not the same.<br />
Neither is the one out here. It&#8217;s not a deli &#8212; it&#8217;s a restaurant. But it&#8217;s not that bad. The breakfasts were similar, and good. It perked up Craig and Cathy. Afterwards, we returned to the apartment (after making a quick beer run) and prepared for the evening&#8217;s festivities.<br />
Chris initially didn&#8217;t want to come with us. So I left him phone numbers should he change his mind. With that, Cathy, Craig, and I took off to the Northeast. Pam (another cousin of ours) arrived to join us in our revelry. Almost as soon as we got there, the question arose: &#8220;Where is Chris?&#8221;<br />
The annoying began.<br />
I made the first call, to let him know that his presence was desired. I made a second call about 30 minutes later to remind him. But I didn&#8217;t make the first call. Nana did. Chris had never met Nana before. Never even spoken to him before. So naturally, Chris was a little caught off guard when he received a phone call from a strange elderly woman. But it finally convinced him to come out.<br />
The evening lasted well into the night. It included more food than we really knew what to do with (all of it very good), and my first taste of scotch. Several months ago, when Uncle Mike and I were both job-hunting, we had wandered into the local liquor store. Mike had pointed out his favourite scotch, one I&#8217;d never seen before. (I may not drink the stuff, but I do know what the good stuff is.) Mike made me agree that when he got his new job, we&#8217;d toast it with a shot of scotch.<br />
I&#8217;m not a scotch drinker. Never was, and after tasting the stuff, I doubt I ever will be. It&#8217;s an acquired taste, and it&#8217;s not one I&#8217;m really keen to acquire. I will admit that it&#8217;s an interesting drink, and I can understand why there are those who are obsessed with it. It&#8217;s too strong for me (I&#8217;m a weakling, I guess) &#8212; I draw my line at 7.5% beer. (Okay, wine is stronger, but that&#8217;s a whole other issue&#8230;)<br />
As we approached our apartment (following the soiree), my cell phone rang. A rarity on its own (not many people call my cell anymore), the fact that it was somewhere past midnight just made the mystery all the more interesting. It was Jim and Frank, returning from their trek to BC. They happened to be calling from the same bar we were passing at that exact moment. [Insert theme to Twilight Zone here.]<br />
Ah, you probably haven&#8217;t heard the saga of Jim and Frank. They&#8217;re Chris&#8217; friends. Chris gave Jim his car when he moved out here. Jim thought it would be a good idea to drive the car (a 1987 Dodge Shadow) to BC and back. There&#8217;s a massive story I could get into here, but I&#8217;ll save you the agony. In short: We never thought the car would make it. (Okay, Chris thought the car would make it; I was amazed the car made it as far as Calgary, let alone two trips over the mountains.)<br />
They were on their return leg, and were looking for a place to stay. Chris and I maintain an open door policy &#8212; it&#8217;s open, so long as it&#8217;s not locked. I was a little worried what Cathy and Craig would say, but they were alright with it &#8212; so I was alright with it. Chris and I slept in the living room that night. (I was sleeping on the couch anyway&#8230;)<br />
Surprisingly enough, the next morning wasn&#8217;t so bad. This further extends Stuart&#8217;s theory that draft beer, although tastier, is worse for you than bottled (or in some cases, canned) beer. I think medical science needs to devote funds to solving this problem.<br />
The tour of the day was Drumheller, home of the Royal Tyrell Museum. This was after a considerable debate as to whether it would be Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump or Drumheller. After a bit of pushing to Drumheller (more to see, frankly more interesting), we loaded up the rented Oldsmobile Alero, and hit the road.<br />
It takes about an hour and a half to get to Drumheller (it&#8217;s not a long drive, but it&#8217;s a little tedious &#8212; there ain&#8217;t much there). It was the first time Cathy&#8217;d been in the Prairies since about 1993 &#8212; it was a first for Craig. Most of the time they marvelled at the yellow fields of &#8230; something (I think it was either mustard seed or canola, but I&#8217;m not sure which). But when we rounded the corner at Horseshoe Canyon, the marvelling skyrocketed.<br />
Starting at Horseshoe Canyon (at least on this road), the Prairies suddenly give way to massive gouges in the ground, carved by wind and rain over millennia. The Badlands. It&#8217;s impressive to see, or at least so Cathy and Craig thought.<br />
The Town (City?) of Drumheller sits in the Red Deer River valley, which I assume is part of the Badlands. It&#8217;s not huge by any means, but because of the geography it sits in, it&#8217;s laid out according to space in the valley itself. It had been over a year since I was last there (see [[A Boys Night out in Calgary, Drumheller, Banff (Bamf!), and Star Wars]]), and it didn&#8217;t really look all that different. Actually, it didn&#8217;t look any different at all. About the same weather, just a few more people.<br />
We went directly to the Tyrell, opting to beat a few tour buses we passed on the way. There&#8217;s only one reason a tour bus would go to Drumheller. The frogs in the pond were quiet, possibly due to the larger number of cars and people, but otherwise it was just the way I last saw it.<br />
Cathy warned me ahead of time that she and Craig are not big readers. They&#8217;re more &#8220;visual&#8221; people, and prefer to see a museum, rather than read it. I was amazed at how fast they were going through the exhibits. I couldn&#8217;t help but speak up if I thought they might miss something interesting. I almost became a tour guide. (Most people would tell me to shut up, but I guess Cathy and Craig like it &#8212; they didn&#8217;t have to read at all.)<br />
About an hour after entering, we exited to the day air. A quick run up the lookout, and we were back down to the car and off. Wanting to stop for a quick drink (we&#8217;d packed beer and Mike&#8217;s Hard Lemonade into a cooler), we pulled off at McMullen Island. I emphasize &#8220;quick&#8221;. Cathy is a mosquito magnet. The moment she got out of the car, they swarmed her. We stayed only long enough for them to finish their drinks (I refrained &#8212; I was driving), and we bolted.<br />
I took them east of Drumheller to the Hoodoos. Not &#8220;The&#8221; Hoodoos, but one of many examples of granite-capped sandstone pillars. Cathy and Craig seemed impressed with the small stone structures, and like the other tourists, climbed all over them. Unlike most of the tourists, though, Craig aimed higher to get better pictures. I followed him &#8230; all the way to the top.<br />
I was amazed at how much out of shape I was. Last year, when Jay, Stuart, and I scuttled up the side, I hadn&#8217;t been quite so tired. I supposed it&#8217;s because the past two or three weeks have been completely occupied with work &#8212; sleep and almost any form of exercise has been a total afterthought. While we were up there, Craig snapped a couple of pictures of Cathy from a distance. Of course, she turned away when we were going to take the pictures. We tried whistling to get her attention, but we were too winded to whistle.<br />
After returning to the valley floor, the three of us climbed back into the car and returned to Drumheller. We stopped briefly at the (Star Mine) Suspension Bridge for a couple of pictures. Our next stop was for lunch at Boston Pizza. After that was a stop for gas, and then a stop at Horseshoe Canyon. The last stop was at home.<br />
Jim and Frank hadn&#8217;t left yet (they wouldn&#8217;t leave until the following day), opting to relax a bit before their push back to Ontario. Cathy, Craig, and I were aiming to go the Barley Mill for dinner and a beer or two, and invited Chris, Jim, and Frank to come. They said they might, but were aiming for Pongo, a restaurant on 17th Ave.<br />
The sky was not cooperating. It threatened to unleash a torrential downpour. Out here, threats are rarely empty. We ended up having to evacuate our patio table (despite carefully placed umbrellas) for the sanctity and dryness of the indoors. A powerful storm raged for a couple of hours, during which time we waited &#8230; and drank beer. I hadn&#8217;t had that much in a very long time (memories of my last trip to visit my friends and old roommates Jon and Stuart in Waterloo came to mind). Luckily, I didn&#8217;t pay for it the next morning&#8230;<br />
Monday was the day of the Big Trip. We were off just after 9:15am, heading into the mountains. Until this point, neither Craig nor Cathy had ever seen the Rockies. Craig had been to Vancouver before, but I have to say that the Rockies are more impressive than the Coastals. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were weaving our way through the range.<br />
Our first destination of the day was Banff. The Alero didn&#8217;t really guzzle gas, but it certainly wasn&#8217;t the most fuel efficient. It also had a tiny gas tank. We filled up there, and then were off to Lake Louise. We figured on two days in the Rockies, mostly owing to distances we had to cover and the need to enjoy it. Day One would cover Moraine Lake, Lake Louise, and the Columbia Icefields. Day Two would be Banff, Kananaskis Country, and then home. (As it stands, we didn&#8217;t make to Kananaskis.)<br />
We went directly to Moraine Lake. The skies were iffy at best, heavily clouded and looking like it might rain. Spots of sunshine periodically poked through, but I wasn&#8217;t really certain we&#8217;d get a good chance to see everything if we didn&#8217;t move before the skies opened. We got spots of rain throughout the day, but nothing to drench us. Luckily, the weather also kept the bugs to a minimum.<br />
Moraine Lake looked very different from the last time I saw it, with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. The snow was gone, the lake was blue (and I do mean blue), and there were more people than you could count (quite a few of whom came on bicycles up a very windy and steep hill). We stopped long enough to take a few pictures and use the bathroom. Then it was off to Lake Louise.<br />
There were lots of people there, too. About as many as when Gerry and I visited it nearly three years ago. Most of them seemed to be people in the marching bands (there was a troupe or two from Minnesota who were following our every move) &#8212; there were certainly enough tour buses to account for all of them. Again, we didn&#8217;t spend a lot of time there, preferring to get a few pictures and run. However, there was also the matter of food.<br />
It dawned on me that while were at Lake Louise, we should have eaten at Moraine Lake&#8217;s lodge. Chateau Lake Louise isn&#8217;t the most cost-effective way to eat (nor did I think we met the dress code). Nor is Lake Louise an easy place to find a bite to eat &#8212; aside from the hotels, there are only two restaurants. We got lucky with one of them, although our simple meal took over 45 minutes to appear. (Note to self: In future, bring lunch with you.)<br />
Then it was back on the highway and on our way to the Icefields Parkway. This is the only road that connects Banff with Jasper. The two National Parks butt up against each other, and are only connected by this single road. During parts of the year, namely winter, this road is closed &#8212; it&#8217;s impassable for upwards of three days at a time after heavy snowfall. It takes a while to check the highway for snow drifts and avalanche debris.<br />
The Icefields Parkway started as nothing more than a simple packtrain trail through the mountains. But in the 1930s, Canada implemented a work-relief program to expand the trail into a more passable road. This road was turned into the present Icefields Parkway in the 1960s. Today, it&#8217;s the best (and probably only) way to see 35 glaciers in five hours. It&#8217;s a spectacular drive with many awe-inspiring photo opportunities. It&#8217;s a real shame that it was cloudy that day.<br />
I was a little anxious to get to the Icefield Centre around 4:00pm, mostly because I thought the Centre closed at 5:00pm. I didn&#8217;t want Cathy and Craig to miss out on a good tour &#8230; particularly one I hadn&#8217;t done before myself. I wanted to see a glacier myself.<br />
Okay, I&#8217;d *seen* a glacier before &#8212; I lived in BC for two years, after all. But I&#8217;d never walked on one. There wasn&#8217;t anything the guides could tell me that I didn&#8217;t already know (years of reading Time Life books and watching Discovery and TLC certain improved my knowledge of such things), but that didn&#8217;t change the desire for the experience.<br />
We arrived about 4:10pm, and immediately changed into pants and shoes. It was cold. Very cold. Glaciers, particularly the Columbia Icefield, create a massive cold wind that constantly blows out of the mountains. It keeps everything in perpetual chill.<br />
The Icefield Centre sits at what used to be at the toe of the Athabasca Glacier (the glacier has since receded). It&#8217;s a relatively new building, built partly by Parks Canada and by Brewster Transportation, who runs the Snocoach tours on the glacier. (Brewster is an Alberta bus company that seems to own nearly every major mechanized tour in the province.) In addition to an interpretive centre, the Centre houses the Snocoach tour centre and a hotel.<br />
We jogged inside and got ourselves ready for a tour. Tickets for the tour aren&#8217;t cheap &#8212; $26 a pop. But it&#8217;s an hour long, and entertaining. We couldn&#8217;t get tickets until the 4:45 departure, which gave us ample time to wander around.<br />
The tour goes in two stages. The first stage is in a standard tour bus. This takes you on an eight-minute trip up the side of the mountain to the Snocoach departure station. The Snocoaches are huge, and not exactly speedy &#8212; it would make the trip about twice as long if had to leave from the Icefield Centre. The trip up from the Icefield Centre is somewhat informational. The introduction to the glacier, how it was formed, and how it transformed the valley.<br />
The driver took car to point things out like the lateral moraines, two huge piles of crushed rock the glacier created when it pushed its way down the mountain. They&#8217;re about 200 metres high, and well over a kilometre or two in length. Concrete companies would kill for something like that &#8212; but they&#8217;re well-protected in Jasper National Park.<br />
As we drove along, the driver identified many of the features (such as the moraines) to the passengers. One of them were the trees that lined the roads. Because of the cold wind that always blows off the glaciers, the trees were missing branches on one side &#8212; they were all swept back. When she asked the age of the trees, many people spouted off numbers. But I guessed right &#8212; 300 years. These trees might have been my height. The constant cold keeps the growing season to only 60-90 days a year. It is very possible that some of these trees might outlast the glacier, which is expected to disappear in 600 years at the current rate of recession.<br />
The road to the Snocoach departure is only partially paved. After a while, the pavement stops, and the road veers downhill. The paved section is the only part on bedrock &#8212; which doesn&#8217;t move. The rest, however, rests on what was once moraine, and is unstable. The bus took a nasty dip (about a 10% grade) on a road that was once level and straight. Even the Snocoach depot is on unstable ground &#8230; which is why none of the buildings there are permanent.<br />
We transferred from our bus to a Snocoach. These are basically enormous six-wheeled buses. The wheels are about two metres high, and under half the height of the bus. 22 of these buses were built, by a Calgary company no less, for use in such terrains. Brewster owns 21 of them. (The 22nd is run by the US Government in Antarctica.) They feature six-wheel drive, engine-reactive transmissions, and a top speed of about 45 kilometres an hour. Downhill. With a tailwind.<br />
Our driver, Steve Jobidon, claimed he was a 105 year-old retired school teacher. He claimed his longevity was from drinking glacier water. My guess is he was overestimating his age by about 80 years, although it was clear that Steve was an avid outdoors person &#8212; skiing, hiking, and all that kind of stuff. He had the tan and the wrinkles to prove it.<br />
The coach lurched out from its berth, turned, and headed towards what looked like a sheer cliff. It&#8217;s not too close form the truth. As the glacier recedes, the Snocoaches have to go down an increasingly steeper hill to get to it. The hill is quite long, and is the steepest unpaved hill in North America &#8212; a 35% grade. The Snocoaches are fitted with a transmission that will slow the Snocoach to a dead crawl (and in fact will stall the engine, ending the coach in an uncontrolled descent) to keep it on the road.<br />
At the bottom of the hill is a large pool of glacier water. This is intentional &#8212; drivers must wash the coach&#8217;s tires before entering the glacier&#8217;s top. Any extra dirt on the glacier will hasten its recession. (The glacier has retreated an estimated kilometre in the past 40-odd years, at least according to my relatives.) Only then does the Snocoach enter the top portion of the Athabasca Glacier.<br />
The Athabasca Glacier is one of several outlets for the Columbia Icefield, a massive 325 square kilometre mass of ice in the Canadian Rockies &#8212; the largest sub-polar icemass in the world. It&#8217;s also one of two hydrogeological apexes. Meltwater from the Icefield drains into three oceans: Pacific (though the Fraser river system), Arctic (through the Mackenzie river system), and the Atlantic (through the Saskatchewan river system, emptying into Hudson Bay). The only such apex is in Siberia. The Icefield, like its outflow glaciers, is also receding &#8212; my Aunt remembers it being 500 square kilometres when she was younger.<br />
Glaciers (including the Icefield) are formed from snow &#8212; lots of snow. More snow that you have ever seen in your life. Every snowfall buries and compresses the previous layers, recrystallizing the snow into grains similar in size and shape to grains of sugar. Over time, the grains grow larger, and air pockets between the grains get smaller, making the snow denser. After about two winters, compressed snow turns into firn &#8212; a stage between snow and glacier ice. Firn it is about half as dense as water. Older, larger ice crystals are so compressed that air pockets between them are very tiny. In very old glacier ice, crystals can reach several inches in length (this can take over a hundred years). The lack of air in glacier ice produces its distinctive blue colour.<br />
Brewster maintains a road on the glacier, about 300 metres long, or so. It takes the Snocoaches from the base of the hill to almost the centre of the glacier, where we tourists got a chance to hop out, and see what being on a glacier was all about.<br />
Well, for starters, it&#8217;s cold. Really cold. But not so cold that there isn&#8217;t runoff from the glacier. Some parts of the surface look frozen, but aren&#8217;t. I felt sorry for anyone silly enough to travel up there with sandals. I took several pictures, including one of a very cold Cathy, sipped the glacial water (which tasted like snow &#8212; go figure), and then got back on the bus before my fingers started going numb. (I was a little cold. It was also raining lightly, which didn&#8217;t help.)<br />
As we waited on the bus, we heard screaming from outside. At first, I thought a fissure opened up on the glacier and swallowed up a bus. Turned out it was the Minnesota marching band following us around &#8212; they were getting a group photo taken on the glacier.<br />
As we wheeled back to the Snocoach platform, Steve happily informed us of the three benefits of glacial water. The first was longevity (Steve claimed that this was one reason why a small glacier, currently known as the AA Glacier &#8212; it&#8217;s between Mount Athabasca and Mount Andromeda &#8212; was going to be named after the oldest tour guide there, namely him), the second was as an aphrodisiac, and the third as a laxative. He offered to speed the Snocoach&#8217;s return&#8230;<br />
Cathy drove on the way back to Banff. This gave me the opportunity to actually see what we drove through. I&#8217;ve been through several passes in the Rockies, nestled between Calgary, Kelowna, Hope, Kamloops, and Jasper. Of all the ones I&#8217;ve travelled on so far, the Icefields Parkway is by far the most beautiful. (I suspect the drive would be awesome on a sunny day.) We stopped several times to take pictures several times (in particular, Cathy was hunting for a moose, which we never saw). One day, I will go back &#8230; when it&#8217;s sunny.<br />
We arrived in Banff just after 8:30. It took us another 45 minutes to find a hotel that wasn&#8217;t booked or cost a fortune to stay at. Still cost us $180 for the night. On the other hand, we were close to downtown, which meant we could go out, eat, drink, and be merry, but still stagger back to the hotel without having to take a cab. This was important, considering I took them to St. James&#8217; Gate, the local Irish Pub (run by the same company that runs the Barley Mill).<br />
The following morning, we started our Banff tour. After checking out and stopping for coffee, we went to the Cave and Basin, the origin of Banff National Park (and to a certain extend, Parks Canada). The last (and only) time I&#8217;d been to Cave and Basin was with Chris, Therese, and Stuart, when we introduced Chris to the Rockies a month or so earlier.<br />
Back in the early 1880s, three men followed the CPR through the wilderness, hoping to make their fortunes. They came across a warm stream, and followed it to its source. Warm streams are rare in this part of the country &#8212; most are ice-cold. They found a hole in the ground that reeked of rotten eggs. Sulphur water. It was precisely what they were looking for &#8212; liquid money. They erected a small hut (which they called a hotel) and started charging people to come and bathe in the waters.<br />
Even back then, the Government was nosey. They got involved and a legal battle ensued. The Government won. They wanted to protect the area and created the Banff Park. To manage it, they created an organisation responsible for the parks. This was the birth of not only Banff National Park, but of Parks Canada.<br />
The Cave and Basin wasn&#8217;t really protected. For years, people swam in the basin (which unbeknownst to them harboured an extremely rare species of snail &#8212; it&#8217;s the only place in the world it&#8217;s found), and bottled the water. The Government built a pool to allow people to swim, and closed the basin to use. The pool was in use until the early 1980s, when it was closed for renovation. However, after the renovation was complete, no-one wanted to take over the maintenance. The pool was closed and remains for historical significance.<br />
The cave is nothing special, basically a big hole in the ground that someone blasted a small tunnel into. Warm water spills into the pool from a gap in the far wall, falling into the pool. It then drains off and out into the basin. And it smells really bad. Cathy couldn&#8217;t spend long in there before she had to get out.<br />
I then tortured Cathy even more by dragging her up the side of the mountain on a boardwalk, showing them where the cabin was, and here the water came from (inside the mountain). The water was rain and snow at one point. It seeps into the mountain, warms from the heat of the Earth, collects minerals (most importantly iron pyrite, which is full of sulphur), and flows back to the surface under pressure.<br />
Our next stop was the Upper Hot Springs, on the other side of the mountain. The Cave and Basin springs are cool &#8212; only about 30 degrees. The Upper Hot Springs are 40 degrees, and used every day by average people who want a nice, warm swim. They first take a bath, $7.00 from your wallet, to be precise, before taking a 20-minute soak. Any longer, and you run medical risk of turning into salt pork. But the faithful are always there, looking for whatever it is that draws them there. Frankly, I&#8217;ll wait until the winter, when its $5.50, and the summer tourists are gone.<br />
Finally, it was time for the big trip &#8212; up Sulphur Mountain itself. In the early 1940s, a man by the name of John Jaeggi started a service where he&#8217;d haul people up the side of the mountain in a farm tractor. He drove them up to a halfway station (still visible from the gondola), where passengers would have to walk the remainder of the distance to the top. This continued until he rolled the tractor (he was alone) in the late 1940s. But Jaeggi&#8217;s dream didn&#8217;t stop there &#8212; he figured an aerial tram would be a better method to get people to the top.<br />
Construction began in the Fall of 1958, and the first aerial cars started running 18 July 1959. It was a colossal project, with most of the equipment coming all the way from Switzerland (which had a great deal of experience with mountains). The Complex at the summit wasn&#8217;t built until 1980, and now serves at the terminus for the gondola, but also has two restaurants (Canada&#8217;s highest), a gift shop, and an observation tower.<br />
Jaeggi wasn&#8217;t the first up, however. The first person to use the mountain was Norman Bethune Sanson. He was the local meteorologist who took readings at the summit of Sanson&#8217;s Peak on Sulphur Mountain from the summer of 1903 until the summer of 1945. A small stone building remains as a testimony to his tenacity to track weather patterns in the Rockies.<br />
Cathy&#8217;s not big on heights &#8212; never was, or so I gather. Yet she was determined to get herself up there. With a lot of guts, we paid the $18 per person fee (really quite reasonable, when you think about it) and climbed in for the ride.<br />
The last time I was on a gondola of any kind was at the CNE. This one was considerably newer, and much nicer. The ride up, aside from the three towers, was very quiet. All we could hear was the wind. Cathy looked straight ahead into the mountain. She glanced only once or twice out any of the other windows, not wanting to know we were as much as 100 metres off the ground. She was very happy to get her foot back on solid ground. Given, we could have walked the trail that leads up the side, but it&#8217;s a two-hour hike, and none of us were that interested in the exercise.<br />
The view from the top of Sulphur Mountain is unbelievable. For anyone who wants to travel to Banff, it&#8217;s a &#8220;must-see&#8221;. Particularly on a sunny day. But bring a sweater &#8212; it&#8217;s cold up there. Craig, the poor guy, had only a t-shirt and shorts. He was freezing during our nice little hike.<br />
Between the gondola complex and Sanson&#8217;s &#8220;cabin&#8221;, there&#8217;s a one-kilometre boardwalk. It&#8217;s a nice trip, with lots to see. And a bit of wildlife, too. Bighorn sheep dot the sides of the boardwalk, particularly around the complex. They&#8217;re pretty docile, and probably well-fed by someone. Craig and I debated as to whether its the tourists or the employees, but it was obvious someone was feeding them.<br />
After our chilly hike, we stopped briefly for a drink in the restaurant. Then it was back down to the base of the mountain. It was time for lunch &#8230; at the Banff Springs Hotel. This was a recommendation from Aunt Brenda, who thought it would be something fun to do.<br />
Along the way, we made two stops. The first was at the Park Administrative Building, which sits at the foot of Banff Ave. Assumedly owing to Stampede (its influence extends a long way), there was a Native t epee and dancers showing their culture to the uncultured tourists. It was humorous to watch the Native elders get people to move in synch. But they didn&#8217;t do a bad job&#8230;<br />
The next (brief) stop was at Banff Falls, on the Bow River. It&#8217;s down the hill from Banff Springs. It&#8217;s more or less a giant rapid. Not horribly impressive, but neat. We tried to take a group photo, but Craig went through some elaborate process of getting the camera to look at us. A chap from Ireland offered to take the picture. In retrospect, it would&#8217;ve been a good idea &#8212; I don&#8217;t know if the camera ever got the picture before it tilted forward.<br />
Banff Springs is an impressive hotel to see from Sulphur Mountain, but equally as impressive from the ground. After parking the car, we ducked inside. We didn&#8217;t do a full tour of the hotel, but went right for the outdoor patio. Lunch took a little longer than I&#8217;d expected, but it was worth the wait. The winner for best meal was Cathy &#8212; a smoked salmon wrap that was absolutely delicious &#8230; would&#8217;ve been better without the cream cheese (at least in my opinion, but I don&#8217;t like the stuff). The meals are pretty reasonable, considering it is the jewel in CP Hotel&#8217;s crown.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long, knowing we had to be back in Calgary for dinner at Uncle Mike and Aunt Brenda&#8217;s. We arrived in Calgary just after 4:00, and we didn&#8217;t get to dinner until nearly an hour later. I had to work the next day, so we didn&#8217;t drag it out too long &#8212; we didn&#8217;t want to repeat Saturday.<br />
The next day was insanity. I didn&#8217;t get to see Cathy and Craig off. In fact, I worked solid until Saturday evening, save for a few breaks to go sleep.<br />
I need a vacation from their vacation&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Be it ever so humble &#8230; and a little messy &#8230; there&#8217;s no place like home.<br />
I missed yesterday&#8217;s log. Oops. Basically, the testing went well &#8212; the changes I made held and so far, things are looking good. That meant I could finally come home. I had to make some near last-minute changes (extending my stay at the Westin, and telling Northwest that I&#8217;d be leaving the following day), but otherwise all was fine.<br />
Actually, the last-minute changes were a little more in my favour &#8212; I had to book an earlier flight because the one I wanted was full. That was fine with me &#8212; I was more interested in coming home.<br />
This morning was mostly involved with updating the testing pages on the staging server, letting the team know which files were &#8220;approved&#8221; and which ones still needed work, and letting them know how to find me. Then it was off to the airport.<br />
If you ever go to Cincinnati Airport, make sure you bring a book. There&#8217;s nothing to look at there, the airport&#8217;s rather dull, and there&#8217;s no store once you pass security. Kinda annoying, if you ask me. Of course, I could have gone back through, but I really couldn&#8217;t be bothered.<br />
I was writing. Not this, but a report that I have to file for what I did. Our client&#8217;s still a little edgy with this so-called solution, so I need to prove it with a nice lengthy document that no-one will read. Fortunately, I&#8217;m good at being verbose. These logs are a testament to that, if nothing else.<br />
I love first class, although I have to admit I feel a little guilty taking it. I know what it&#8217;s like to be peering from steerage into the plushly-furnished curtained area. Unlimited drinks (which admittedly, I didn&#8217;t take advantage of), nicer meals, and big, comfy seats. Very nice.<br />
The flight from Cincinnati to Minneapolis was about an hour and a half, before I got dumped there to catch a connecting flight. During that time I took the opportunity to recharge my laptop&#8217;s battery. It&#8217;s a long life battery, but I wanted it to last the remaining leg of the journey. Northwest doesn&#8217;t show in-flight movies on such &#8220;short haul&#8221; flights, and I had nothing to read. I figured I&#8217;d entertain myself with a report.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to explain how much I enjoyed seeing the Prairies again. Land that stretches out forever, where it&#8217;s rare that cloud covers everything, where the buffalo used to roam, and the deer and the antelope are hunted for fun.<br />
We passed over Drumheller on our way in (I was amazed that I could recognize it from the air), and sailed smoothly into Calgary. Being the second from the front of the plane, I was the second one off. However, I was the first into Customs, which I blitzed right through. I completely bypassed baggage claim (carry-ons &#8212; it&#8217;s the only way to fly), and tore out the front door. I grabbed the first taxi, and was on my way home.<br />
I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m much more adjusted to the western climate &#8212; it&#8217;s drier here, and I&#8217;m not a big fan of the oppressive humidity of the east. I was very happy not to be sweltering in the heat, and feeling a cool breeze for the first time in over a week.<br />
So if you&#8217;re ever living on the air in Cincinnati, don&#8217;t look for WKRP. It doesn&#8217;t exist. However, there is a WKRC.<br />
No kidding&#8230;</p>
