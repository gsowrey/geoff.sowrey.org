Day 27<br />
The trip portion of this journey is officially over. The train rolled into Halifax early this morning while we slept. We awoke slowly, and moved sluggishly. While many are looking forward to going home, most of us are sad that we&#8217;ve come to the end of the line. Appropriately, it was raining.<br />
Packing up our train lives was no easy task. We&#8217;ve accumulated a surprising amount of stuff over the last month &#8212; bags were literally bursting. We had about two and a half hours to clean our stuff out, which seemed ample enough to find everything. I wandered about the train a bit, sometimes tripping over others in the midst of finding all their clothes.<br />
It almost felt like I was moving out of a favourite apartment and moving away from old friends. There was a certain sombre sadness of leaving the train after being on it for so long. We&#8217;ll only be using the train in coming days as a place to take meals. From here on, we&#8217;ll be staying in a hotel. We&#8217;re done riding trains. Not counting public transit, I don&#8217;t figure on taking a train until next year.<br />
The time came, and VIA came around with a tractor to collect our bags. They&#8217;d arrive with the vans at the hotel later on. We gathered in the station in anticipation of our shuttles. Roger and Trish vanished to rent a car, as did Duffy and Gerry. While waiting, one of the VIA crew from our train (I think his name is Carl) handed me an envelope. He told me not to tell anyone, and not to open it until I got to the hotel.<br />
We loaded our shuttle bus for our last hotel, a bare block from the CBC Halifax office. The driver lost me in the maze of turns. And I don&#8217;t get lost easily. The hotel is a fair distance from downtown, but it&#8217;s actually not too bad. We can feasibly walk the distance. The hotel is quite large, which is nice. It even has a small lounge. Something I&#8217;m sure the crew will make repeated use of.<br />
We were unable to check into our rooms right away. Some managed to get rooms, but the majority of us stuffed our baggage into an unused conference room. Some simply crashed and relaxed for the afternoon. Some of us were more interested in adventure.<br />
Roger, Trish, Amy, Stefani, Analisa, and myself piled into Roger&#8217;s rented Lincoln Navigator (upgraded thanks to several nearly-expired upgrade coupons) and bolted for Peggy&#8217;s Cove. The Bills, the Robs, Gerry, Duffy, Emma, and Lisa followed in two minivans. We arrived quite a bit ahead of them, no doubt in part to Roger&#8217;s ability to traverse distances in safe haste. Although we took the &#8220;long&#8221; route, we arrived in under 45 minutes.<br />
It&#8217;s been about 22 years since I last set foot in Nova Scotia. Yet I remembered the area as we approached Peggy&#8217;s Cove. I wondered if I would, considering how young I had been at the time. As we exited the forest for the coastal spaces, I started to recognize a few things. Then a faint memory came to me &#8230; one I hadn&#8217;t thought of in years. A little over two decades ago, I got carsick into one of the many little bays. I dreaded a repeat show &#8212; my sister would never let me live it down.<br />
Peggy&#8217;s Cove was, unsurprisingly, crowded with tourists. The streets were full of them, making driving a little treacherous. We finally arrived at the parking lot at the edge of the coast, next to the famous Peggy&#8217;s Cove Lighthouse and Post Office. It&#8217;s something to have postcards with a Peggy&#8217;s Cove cancellation.<br />
Exiting from our safe, warm vehicle, we found the he wind was biting. Perhaps not as bad as the previous night&#8217;s mosquitoes, but it was still breath taking. Especially when, like myself, you&#8217;re wearing shorts. (Actually, I wasn&#8217;t that cold, but hopping from a warm car to the chilly air was pause for thought. Amy and I were a little cool, but didn&#8217;t suffer as much as Roger, Stefani, and Trish. Analisa played it smart and stayed in the gift shop most of the time we were there.)<br />
We hopped over the rocks like mountain goats. Some hid behind them periodically, due to the cold. I marvelled at the water-rounded rocks, the cracks, the seaweed, the sky, the waves, and the undeniable smell of fresh saltwater. A month ago, I marvelled at a similar scene on the west coast. This was simultaneously similar, yet completely different. (And despite that the two massive oceans are connected, the Atlantic has a decidedly different smell than the Pacific. I&#8217;d love to know why.)<br />
The two other vans appeared about 20 minutes after we arrived. Soon the rocks were swarming with CBC train staff. We would congregate in small groups, filter out across the rolling waves of stone, and regroup in other places. At a distance, we probably looked no different than seagulls as they ride the ocean.<br />
We left about an hour after arriving. The goal was also to see Lunenburg during our tour of the province. As we left town, we started to look for the Flight 111 Memorial. On the night of 2 September 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Peggy&#8217;s Cove. All 229 passengers and crew were lost. The tragedy put the small town of Peggy&#8217;s Cove on the world map for a time, and has left a mark ever since. Only a few short kilometres away, visible from Peggy&#8217;s Cove, is a simple memorial to those who lost their lives, and those who were first on the scene: the fishers of Peggy&#8217;s Cove.<br />
You can&#8217;t see the memorial from the road. It requires a bit of a walk down a gravel path until you reach a stone platform upon which are two stone discs, mounted perpendicular to the platform, at an angle to each other. One side of the discs is rounded, the inside flat. The inside faces out to the ocean, the surfaces engraved. One of the discs has three notches out of the top &#8212; 111. Supposedly, the notches look towards where the plane went down. You can&#8217;t see it from shore. The crash site is just over the horizon. Over three years have passed since the tragic events, but flowers still arrive here.<br />
The two vans did finally arrive in Lunenburg &#8212; we did not. Although we had been headed in that direction, we hadn&#8217;t gone out to the highway (the fastest method), and were in no real hurry. In fact, we were sidetracked by an overwhelming need to eat. Luckily for us, you often find the best meals when you&#8217;re on the verge of getting totally lost.<br />
Lost was exactly was I was beginning to feel like. With Trish navigating, Roger was bombing up and down hills in search of &#8230; well, probably not really in search of anything. That&#8217;s half the fun of exploring &#8212; knowing you really don&#8217;t need to find anything. That&#8217;s how we ended up in the middle of nowhere (actually, it was somewhere around Upper Tantallon, wherever that is). We stopped at a general store, where we got directions to the nearest good restaurant. Luckily, it was just around the next bend.<br />
The Pilot House Cafe is definitely off the beaten path. So far off, in fact, that it was empty save for the sole waitress. The inside was cottagey, looking (somewhat) recently renovated. Apparently, the cafe is primarily for the lodgers of the adjoining cabins. When the tourist flow is slow, rogue travellers are eagerly welcomed. The first question was &#8220;who wants chowder?&#8221;.<br />
The chef, Billy, knows his food. Seafood chowder so thick you could spackle a house (and came in the most darling bowls); calamari so fresh, soft, and tangy as to almost pierce the soul; and if you&#8217;d told me that you could put scallops on a pizza, I&#8217;d have called you crazy. The taste is otherworldly. I won&#8217;t mention dessert. Trust me, you&#8217;ll only drool over your keyboard, and that just doesn&#8217;t look attractive.<br />
Packed to the rim, we rolled out of the restaurant and found our way back to Halifax. The trip took barely 20 minutes &#8212; we took the highway. We didn&#8217;t make a beeline back to the hotel, though. Tonight was our last (planned) full team dinner, at a restaurant called Soho Kitchen downtown. Analisa wanted to acquire a new pair of shoes for the event. This led to almost everyone thinking they could use something. Everyone except me. My bag are already too full &#8212; I simply can&#8217;t pack anything else in. If I buy any souvenirs in this city, it&#8217;s going to have to be small.<br />
We sidled into one of the local malls, and we ducked into a Sears Outlet store. I hadn&#8217;t been in an outlet store for a while. I remembered why. Nothing to be found in sight. At least for Roger and I. Amy, Trish, and Analisa hunted around. Stefani didn&#8217;t seem all that enthralled, admittedly. Finding the store a bit of a washout, we returned to the car and pulled around front to the rest of the mall complex. This time, I stayed in the car. I was tired from all the activity (and the food). I slept for a few minutes while the others shopped.<br />
We were a little slow recongregating. Roger and Trish were back early. Stefani was maybe a minute or two late. Analisa took considerably longer. But we could not find Amy. She&#8217;d vanished. We patrolled the mall, at first with our eyes, and then with the car. No sign of her anywhere. We checked the stores she&#8217;d said she was going to check. Nothing. We were getting a little worried. We thought that perhaps we had somehow managed to miss each other, and Amy had taken a cab back to the hotel. As we were making our last pass to make sure we hadn&#8217;t missed something, Amy walked out of the mall&#8217;s entrance. Relieved that we&#8217;d found her, we returned to the hotel. Tonight was our wrap party.<br />
In theatre, you&#8217;d normally wait until the end of the production to hold the festivities. Our last show is Saturday, 5 October. But starting tomorrow, we start losing our staff. Lives need to be lived, and almost all of us have taken a month&#8217;s leave of absence from them. With our time together rapidly closing, it&#8217;s our last chance for a full team dinner.<br />
We went to Soho Kitchen, on a recommendation from Daryl, a former and still-periodic Halifax resident. It&#8217;s a more local haunt, and definitely not a tourist trap. Crammed into a side room that barely fit us all, we outnumbered the remaining patrons. We easily overpowered them with volume. The menu items were so tantalising that it was extremely difficult to choose. Lisa took it upon herself to choose for me (I didn&#8217;t offer a lot of resistance). Thai scallops. Quite tasty.<br />
Speeches that weren&#8217;t meant to be speeches followed dinner. Neil wanted to thank a few people who had made the trip happen, and memorable. Unfortunately, he went down the slippery slope of inclusion, and found himself having to thank everyone. It&#8217;s a dicey problem any of us could have walked into. If you don&#8217;t make just the right speech, you run the risk of offending someone &#8212; either by understating something they think was more important, or perhaps forgetting them all together. Still, I have to give Neil credit for at least trying to say something about everyone. No-one else had tried by that point, and I doubt ever will. It was a more emotional event than I think any of us really realized.<br />
Following our repast, we adjourned to the Seahorse Pub, a local legend since 1948. The interior was &#8230; in transition. Renovations in the corner seemed to indicate that the bar had some work planned. It was almost impossible to tell when the last time the renovations had even been touched.<br />
We toasted our success, and the people who would soon leave. Emma convinced me to join her in a game of darts. That was her first mistake. She suggested a game called &#8220;cricket&#8221;. That was her second mistake. I must laud Emma&#8217;s patience as she repeatedly taught me the rules, which seemed so complicated at the time. (In all honestly, speaking becomes complicated after enough pints of beer.) We never finished the game &#8212; neither of us could hit the bullseye after a while &#8212; but I still lost.<br />
It was then back to the hotel. I don&#8217;t really remember the walk back, other than I felt a draining urge to get to my room as quickly as possible. We don&#8217;t have an early morning tomorrow, but sleep is still a wonderful thing.<br />
Oh, what was in the envelope you ask? Hmm&#8230; I forgot to mention that, didn&#8217;t I? Well, Carl and I had talked a bit on the train on our way from Montreal. He, like the other regional managers for VIA, could spot a railfan around the next corner. He could also tell that I was far from worn out from our little jaunt across the country. He had asked if I would be interested in riding the Bras D&#8217;or, VIA&#8217;s rail cruise from Halifax to Sydney, on Cape Breton island. I had replied at the time that I would love to go, but simply couldn&#8217;t afford it. Carl said he would see what he could do. In the envelope was a round-trip pass on the Bras D&#8217;or.<br />
Who said there&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch?</p>

Day 26<br />
There was apparently a bit of activity last night. Early in the morning, Julie came up to me and asked if I&#8217;d heard anything during the night. Aside from the train itself, I heard little. Julie seemed &#8230; undecided, and then walked away. That, my friends, is a mystery just screaming to be solved. I had to know what happened last night. I checked with Emma, my guaranteed source for information. She didn&#8217;t know. The both of us were now insatiably curious. The investigation would continue most of the day.<br />
One of the things we were told early on, long before we left Vancouver, was that we were never, ever to drink on board. This was explained away as insurance reasons. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the truth or the story, but the fact was that we were not to drink. Officially, the rule was followed. Unofficially, we broke every single rule we were given within the first two days of the trip. Both VIA and the CBC turned a blind eye to almost everything. At least until last night.<br />
While breaking the rule (for the umpteenth time) of not staying in the baggage car while the train is in motion, several people (whose names I shall not divulge) indulged in another forbidden activity: alcoholic consumption. All of this was known, common, and though not accepted, tolerated. However, being the second-to-last night on the train, a couple of people got &#8230; happy. And perhaps a little sloppy. One of them, staying in a room in my Chateau car, accidentally went into Julie&#8217;s room, which was on the following Chateau car. I can&#8217;t really imagine what took place at that exact moment. When I finally heard the story, I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing.<br />
Today was almost a repeat of yesterday, just with a shorter event. And a different city. And different event layout. And different performers. And no rain, with lots of wind. And it was hot. Okay, today has no semblance to yesterday, except the province, arrive, set-up, event, tear-down, pack-up, and leave.<br />
Today was Moncton. Most of us had never been here before (like any of us had been to Campbellton &#8212; except Marc).<br />
We had no Internet access. Quel surprise. A little miffed since I could see a huge NBTel tower about a kilometre away. I can only assume that either NBTel doesn&#8217;t have a 1x network, or doesn&#8217;t have a deal with Bell Canada to rebroadcast users onto Bell&#8217;s network. It didn&#8217;t change the fact that I had to find an Internet Cafe. I wandered east through town on directions from local VIA staff. Up and down streets I went, but no Internet to be found. Not even a hint of Internet. For all I could tell, Moncton was digitally isolated from the rest of the world. The only thing I found of note were three churches sitting kiddie-corner to each other, at the corner of Church and Queen: United, United Baptist, and Anglican. Connectivity, yes, but with the wrong deity.<br />
Deprived of Internet, I returned to the train to begin our set-up. The weather was windy, but promised little chance of rain. We went for the entire New Media configuration. Some of the other tents skipped some of their items: Sports dropped the cut-outs, and the Boutique opted not to use &#8220;The Beast&#8221;. All the tents were heavily staked down, and remaining signage weighted down with sandbags and tied up. Our loose items (such as the bookmarks) had to sit carefully on the tables so a strong gust wouldn&#8217;t blow them off into oblivion. Sports, at least, had a small mountain of fridge magnets to hold their pages in place.<br />
Although we didn&#8217;t officially open until 15:00, people were already arriving by 14:30. Early arrivals weren&#8217;t a problem &#8212; we were all ready to go live with the show. Our friend Murphy, mostly silent throughout the trip, decided we&#8217;d become too smug in our preparations. That&#8217;s probably why the power went out at 14:58. Apparently the entire neighbourhood lost power, not just us. Most of the tents, half of the VIA station, most of the mobile, and the entire train went without power. At first I was confused, since we normally run off our generator, and our cars off the locomotive&#8217;s HEP generator. It would figure that the first time we run everything off shore power that there&#8217;s a blackout.<br />
Somehow, the New Media tent &#8212; the one with the largest power requirements of any tent &#8212; was unaffected. News, Sports, half of the mobile, the museum, and half the train station were completely in the dark. Within twenty minutes, the engine was switched to HEP, and power ran back through the train. The museum came back to life, and visitors finally started to walk through. News and Sports would be without power until much later in the afternoon, when the power company finally fixed the problem.<br />
The lack of electricity didn&#8217;t dampen any spirits, however. Visitors created a near two-hour line to see the museum. Every tent had a swarm of visitors. Koceila and I were on our toes most of the time. Koceila talked mostly about the Archives site &#8212; I talked to people who have been reading my journals online. It&#8217;s still really bizarre being a virtual pseudo-celebrity. I&#8217;m truly amazed at the number of people who read these things. I&#8217;d always thought it would be kind of neat to do. That people would not only read it, but try and find me was something I honestly hadn&#8217;t expected.<br />
Later in the afternoon, we had to temporarily close the museum. This time, it wasn&#8217;t due to errant electricity. It was due to the scheduled arrival of VIA&#8217;s Ocean train. The Ocean runs from Halifax to Montreal, and is the oldest scheduled train in Canada. It will have run for 100 years of service in 2004 &#8212; a trip I might have to make for myself. As it is scheduled (runs every day except Tuesday), we had to temporarily shut down for about 40 minutes while the Ocean did its thing. Then it was off to Montreal, and we got back to entertaining.<br />
Speaking of entertaining, there were a few live acts floating around. But not on a stage outside. Due to problems with the site layout and the potential weather, the stage was inside. That&#8217;s where you could find Anthony McLean, a couple of bands, and the Moncton Ballet. Yes, the ballet. Believe me, we scratched our heads at that one, too. They were good, even crammed into the wee spaces of the station.<br />
About a half hour before we began tear-down, I had a woman approach me. I haven&#8217;t seen a smile that large since we&#8217;d started. Her first words were &#8220;thank you for coming&#8221;. She then detailed almost everything in our museum, and how wonderful it was to see it all. &#8220;You should be proud of the work you&#8217;ve all done here. The team must be so amazing to make this all work. You should congratulate yourselves on a job well done!&#8221; Just as calmly as she appeared, she vanished into the crowd.<br />
It&#8217;s people like her that kept us going after our longest, hardest days. They&#8217;re the people we want to reach out to. Not because we want the congratulations, but because they&#8217;ve supported the CBC over the years. Public company or not, without loyal viewers (and listeners), the CBC would not exist.<br />
As the sun went down, we started to strike our sets. For the tents, it would be the last time &#8212; we won&#8217;t be using them in Halifax. Things went back in boxes, tables were collapsed, monitors packed away, and things carted back to the train. When it finally got dark, we noticed something. Mosquitoes. The last time we&#8217;d seen insects was Melville. We&#8217;d had to close early due to marauding hoardes of the bloodsuckers. There weren&#8217;t as many in Moncton. Probably because the air traffic controllers had to line the beasts up in order to get near us. And unlike their Melvillian cousins, these little buggers actually hurt!<br />
Our strike was faster than previous ones, probably the fastest we&#8217;ll ever do. Whether or not it was due to experience, or due to the overwhelming flood of giant mutant mosquitoes is up for debate. Either way, our second-to-last pack job was done in record time, which was fine for us &#8212; the faster we could lock the doors, the less painful the bites would be.<br />
On [[CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Opening Event Pacific Central Station|5 September]], we had our first full-scale strike of our sets. It took us over three and a half hours. We joked that we would have it down to an hour and a half when we got to Halifax. We broke the time tonight, our last item loaded into the baggage cars barely an hour and a half after starting. It was reason to celebrate.<br />
But it&#8217;s a bittersweet celebration. Our time together is rapidly ending. Tonight will be our last on the train. As I write this, we are rolling steadily closer to Halifax. Tomorrow we leave our home of the last month for the last time. We take with us the strange stories that can only be created when living in the conditions as those on our train. We will miss it dearly.<br />
I spent some time in the Banff Park&#8217;s dome, watching the train weave its way through the canyon of trees. The only light came from the lead locomotive&#8217;s headlamps, and from the odd light buried in the forests. I will only be hearing the mournful blats of the horn for a little while longer. I&#8217;m still debating on whether I want to go to sleep tonight.<br />
On [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Vancouver|7 September]], I said I would have a difficult time leaving this train. I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>

Day 25<br />
No-one slept well last night. It was too hot, too bouncy, too loud. I think it was also because the last night we slept on the train was 18 September. Since then, we&#8217;ve slept in large beds in hotels, or at home. Our first night on the train was exciting, so we didn&#8217;t notice the change. After over a week in controlled conditions, the erratic environment of the train is a little unsettling. Today, we get back into the groove we had when we started almost a month ago.<br />
Today is what used to be a typical day for us: arrive in the early morning (usually in the wee hours), set up the displays, entertain and inform the local populous, pack up, leave late in the evening. We&#8217;re all looking forward to the regularity for the next couple of days. Most of us seem to like this pattern. We&#8217;ve officially become the Cirque du CBC.<br />
I awoke to an announcement suggesting we eat breakfast and get ready to unload the train. For only the second time since the trip started, and the first on the train, I&#8217;d overslept. As I walked down the length of our Chateau cars, I could see the river, or the Gulf of St. Lawrence (a significant body of water, regardless). Admittedly, I&#8217;d never been to Campbellton before, so I wasn&#8217;t sure what it was, and I never did find out. [Ed. Note: It was neither. Campbellton sits on the south shore of the Restigouche River, west of the river mouth, south of the GaspÃ© Peninsula.]<br />
Gulping down breakfast in record time, I ran outside to catch up with the rest of the team already beginning to unpack the baggage car. Set-up was almost too easy. We&#8217;ve done these so many times that the problems are reduced to predicting the weather. (No wireless connection in Campbellton &#8212; no surprise, there &#8212; so we couldn&#8217;t check the online weather forecast.)Koceila had little trouble, learning the ropes extrememly fast. As usual, crowds were forming long before the doors were officially open. We&#8217;ve never turned people away, just so long as we can accommodate them. Our official start was 12:00, but we were entertaining long before then.<br />
Roger was running around with the Polaroid camera while everyone assembled their sets. I think Roger either got too much sleep last night, or has gone certifiably insane. Either way, his smile and laughter is becoming infectious. (Hmm&#8230; maybe we&#8217;re all going insane&#8230;) His jovial condition proved advantageous when a car drove right into the barricaded parking lot we were using for our show. Roger looked a little ticked at first. He went to talk to the driver, an elderly woman, and pointed the direction out of the lot. Then he took a picture of the passenger. He came over and told me, giggling the whole time, that the passenger was Hazel McCallion, the mayor of Mississauga, ON. Apparently, she was visiting her sister &#8212; the driver.<br />
As usually, we received our volunteers a few minutes into the game. Normally, we&#8217;re given students or local CBC employees. I can only assume that students of sufficient age were hard to come by. This time, we received two of the oldest and kindest ladies in Campbellton. Neither really knew how to use a computer. I stood there and laughed to myself at the idea, but I knew by this point that I really didn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s about servicing people, not computers. So long as they reached out to those who came around, we would be successful. And since these women knew almost everyone in town (it seemed), success came easily. (The volunteers would change partway through the afternoon, and we&#8217;d get late-teenaged volunteers.)<br />
The weather had been iffy from the moment we started &#8212; cold, damp, and threatening rain &#8212; but we risked a full New Media set-up. It was the small towns that we loved all through our trip. We were hoping Campbellton would be as much a success. I kept one eye on the sky at all times.<br />
Just after noon, we already had a large crowd. We were off to a strong start. We were feeling very positive about the event (the previous two hadn&#8217;t really done anything for our self esteem). Then came a sound that we hadn&#8217;t been expecting, and initially worried us tremendously. Protesters. A large group of them marched up the street, whistling, chanting, and waving signs. I think everyone in our group froze, wondering what kind of trouble we were going to get ourselves into. At first, we thought they were protesting something we had done, or that CBC didn&#8217;t resign Ron MacLean. (Hey, some hockey fans are that devoted.)<br />
It turned out to be the local CUPE union, striking due to a lack of a contract. Some of their signs showed slogans, while others wished CBC and Radio-Canada a happy 50th birthday. In both languages! (We can only assume they did that so they would be &#8220;accepted&#8221; at the event, rather than politely asked to leave. As they caused no trouble, we didn&#8217;t see a need to have them removed. They stayed for about an hour, mingling with the crowd, seeing our displays, cheering for whomever was on stage. Eventually, they gathered back together and returned to their march.<br />
Rain came again, as dreaded. There were the odd deluges, but nothing as serious as Montreal, and all fairly brief. Also, we were on a parking lot, so we didn&#8217;t have to worry about mud. Except for Children&#8217;s, that is &#8212; they were in the low part of the parking lot. Lake CBC formed under their tent after a while, and the tent ended up having to shut down (the Mural was moved inside the VIA station to remain available). The Boutique also had to close early due to rain falling on their spare supplies.<br />
Throughout the day, we had people of all ages, all walks of life, and speaking both languages, come out to see our displays. All of them, regardless of language, loved everything. Not a single disparaging word. Even the weather didn&#8217;t seem to stop anyone from coming out.<br />
One woman in particular was one of our volunteers, Irene. She was perhaps the single most energetic person I&#8217;ve seen since leaving Vancouver. Although as part of her volunteering she made an effort to promote us, I think there was a lot of self-interest. Even when Irene&#8217;s time helping out was over, she hung around. She saw the museum, even did a stint at Be An Anchor, where she entertained the crowd by adding on the first verse of &#8220;Are You Lonely Tonight (for Seniors)&#8221; &#8230; after a lot of goading from me and several of her friends.<br />
During a lull in the activities, I made an effort to wander around Campbellton. Having never been there before, and not having been particularly on the ball (Marc&#8217;s father is from Campbellton, so assumedly, Marc knows something), I didn&#8217;t really know what too look for. The only real thing I could find was the bridge linking Campbellton with the opposite shore of the river. That, and a small, rusty narrow-gauge railway whose lineage I couldn&#8217;t figure out. (It&#8217;s not in my Trackside Guide.) Things I need to remember to research when I get home&#8230;<br />
In other places, we&#8217;ve had little trouble closing down at the end of an event. Campbellton was just such an example, until Koceila and I started turning off computers. First, all our volunteers suddenly vanished, leaving Koceila and I to tackle it alone. Also, Koceila can&#8217;t see well in the dark. And having a the local CBC station doing a broadcast next to our tent introduced issues of ownership. I think we lost a powerbar or two tonight.<br />
Even with our difficulties, we were headed for a new record for packing the train. Although the Boutique was already well away, packing up in less than two hours was still something to celebrate. Then the most stunning show of the Northern Lights sidetracked us. (The technical crew says that the lights in Biggar were better.) We stopped our heaving and shoving, and for the next half hour watched the celestial curtains flow back and forth across the sky. I know how the Northern Lights are formed, but that doesn&#8217;t take away one speck of wonder while watching them.<br />
Our train was to leave at 22:30. That left us over an hour to visit Dooley&#8217;s next door. (Literally next door &#8212; the rear entrance of the bar comes out onto the station platform.) We talked about the fun we&#8217;ve had, the show&#8217;s we&#8217;ve done, and the people we&#8217;ve met. We didn&#8217;t talk about the three remaining shows. A lot of us want the shows to be over, but a few of us don&#8217;t want this to end. This train is about to reach the light at the end of the tunnel.<br />
Three of the VIA staff were in Dooley&#8217;s with us, assumedly against rules. (I get the feeling the Service Manager didn&#8217;t know they were in the bar.) They signalled us a few minutes before 22:30, and suggested we settle the tab and get back on board. There were a few people who seemed to think we weren&#8217;t leaving on time. The train left at 10:30, as planned.<br />
After weeks of negotiation and agreements, Daryl finally got the change to climb into the cab of #6403 to film our progress as we headed east. The whole process has been ridiculous, bordering on insanity. Daryl&#8217;s filmed in the cockpits of fighter jets while in flight &#8212; something far more dangerous that sitting in the cab of a locomotive. But VIA has their rules. It wasn&#8217;t until Montreal that wheels really started turning, apparently. Only now did things finally pay off. We climbed into the Skyline dome to watch &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; on DVD. Several of the others climbed into their rooms, roomettes, and berths to sleep.<br />
When I finally turned in, I rolled up my window blind to watch the passing vista. Like when we left Vancouver, it was pitch dark outside. But the sky was on fire &#8212; the Northern Lights made the heavens look like they were being ripped apart. The waves of light undulated rapidly, weaving in and out of each other, appearing suddenly and disappearing just as fast.<br />
I fell asleep watching the celestial ballet.</p>

Day 24<br />
Today is a travel day, but we didn&#8217;t leave Quebec City until almost 18:30. That gave us plenty of time to do the things we wanted to do, and hadn&#8217;t done the day before. For me, that was sleep in &#8212; the previous day had worn me out.<br />
I was behind on my journals. Partly because I&#8217;d wanted to get away from a computer for a day, and also because I get easily distracted. (Trains, interesting cities, and shiny metal objects will do that.) After breakfast and helping Ivan with his email, I sat down for a few hours of solid typing and image manipulation.<br />
It&#8217;s just dawned on me that you might not really know how I write a typical journal entry. It usually starts with a pivot event or two that happened during the day. If there was nothing particularly outstanding, then it&#8217;s a theme. If I&#8217;m really running short of something to focus on, then I&#8217;ll just tell the tale of the day. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll be able to punctuate it along the way with something interesting or humourous. I do like to set context, which is why you&#8217;ll often see historical content thrown in. Having taken pictures, I also have a visual record of what we&#8217;ve done, just in case that dusty expanse known as my memory doesn&#8217;t quite fit the bill.<br />
Now that just covers half the problem &#8212; the text. (Well, not entirely. I also have to edit it, because things like this probably won&#8217;t make it into the official record.) I still have pictures to prepare. The easy part is actually preparing them &#8212; the hard part is selecting them. I take a lot of pictures &#8212; I&#8217;ve taken about 2,000 pictures already, and I&#8217;m far from stopping this trip. I&#8217;ve still got a long way to go. Once I&#8217;ve picked about a half dozen pictures, I run them through Photoshop, which has a couple of macros I built for myself. These resize the images automatically. Then all I have to do is connect to the Internet, and away everything goes to Toronto. Normally, it&#8217;s over the wireless system, but when the wireless doesn&#8217;t work, I use the hotel&#8217;s connection. In Quebec City, at least, I need only plug in the antenna.<br />
Finishing up, I checked out of my room and put my bags in a holding room. I had no idea what I was going to do next &#8212; I I hadn&#8217;t really planned for anything else. I ran into Analisa and, Lisa in the lobby, who were going to CafÃ© Suisse, the restaurant we&#8217;d left early from last night. Not in the mood for a fondue, I wanted something else. As odd as it might sound, I wanted French onion soup. I had yet to find a restaurant that served it (which I found strange, in a stereotypical sort of way). Analisa wasn&#8217;t about to let me down, though, and asked the taxi driver &#8230; in French. Analisa was determined to practice speaking French. The driver suggested I try the CafÃ© de la Paix.<br />
I had passed the place the day before and had paid it no mind. A small, basement-level restaurant with an unassuming sign, it was easy to see how the average person could walk by. I started going over French in my mind, and tried to figure out what I was going to say. This made me a little sad, actually &#8212; 17 years ago, I had caught myself actually thinking in French while walking through Basse-Ville. Now I had to make a concerted effort to translate my intentions into passable French. I took my seat and examined the menu. Then it was time to make an order. The staff seemed more than willing to humour my poorer-than-highschool French. Soupe l&#8217;onion gratinee (the waiter had to check to make sure the soup was even available) et salade cesar, avec une biere Blanche de Chambly.<br />
The soup was outstanding. Not too salty, and the onion wasn&#8217;t overpowering. A thin cover of bread and a thick layer of cheese helped the soup retain its temperature. It was definitely home-made (well, as &#8220;home&#8221; as a restaurant can get) &#8212; Lipton instant soup this was not. I&#8217;ve had lots of Caesar salads in my day. I&#8217;d even go so far as to almost consider myself an aficionado. I know a good Caesar when I have one. The salad now holds the number two slot of my all-time favourite Caesar salads, following my family&#8217;s. The beer I&#8217;d had before, but was perfect for this sort of meal. I was in heaven. The only thing better would have been to share the moment with someone close to me.<br />
I was proud of myself. I made it through the entire meal, including compliments (at least, I hope they came across as compliments) without slipping into English. Then I got the bill. It wasn&#8217;t the cost that threw me &#8212; I had no idea how to ask to break a $20 bill into two tens. I went through every last scrap of remaining French education in my head. Aside from the hollow echoes of lessons past, I drew a blank. I broke into English. The waiter didn&#8217;t seem to mind at all, replying to me in French. I tipped heavily.<br />
I wandered a little aimlessly, thinking I&#8217;d head up Rue Saint-Jean and seeing what I could see. Along the way, I found Marc, and Rob W. (freshly returned from seeing The Who in Toronto) on their way to an Irish pub. They suggested I tag along. It sounded more interesting than what I had in mind. (I&#8217;d already spent a large portion of the last day and a half on my own, and social interaction was far more appealing.) Gerry appeared across the street. The three of us called him over. Whether he was going to the same pub, I don&#8217;t know. The four of us walked into the pub only to find several of our comrades, already enjoying the ambiance.<br />
Duffy, Rob N., Bill S., Bill C., Tracy, Stefani, Emma, and Cliff welcomed the four of us almost like Norm had just walked in the door. It was a little peculiar trying to imagine that I was sitting in an Irish pub in Vieux Quebec. We could have easily been in any other city along our route. The only indication was a number of signs in French. We talked and drank well into the afternoon, until we realized that we needed to return to the hotel and retrieve our bags. Some took a taxi, but most of us walked. By then, we knew the city well enough not to get lost, and the walk wasn&#8217;t really that far.<br />
We grabbed our things from the hotel, hopped a taxi, and were soon back at the station. (Yes, the train station was closer to the hotel than the pub. But our bags aren&#8217;t exactly light.) We then played our favourite and most oft-played game, &#8220;Hurry Up and Wait&#8221;. Our train wasn&#8217;t there, and couldn&#8217;t come in until after the 17:35 train to Montreal was gone. When the train did finally arrive, we were told we had 15 minutes to board so we could keep to schedule. VIA kept to schedule, now that the Renaissance train is no longer part of our consist.<br />
As the train pulled out into the darkening Quebec City sky, rain was falling. Daryl was miffed because he couldn&#8217;t get a decent shot through the water-streaked windows. Rose and Colleen discussed the shocking news that Ron MacLean had not been resigned for Hockey Night in Canada. (Though both had the opinion that this revelation was far from over.) Cliff and Trish almost dread Campbellton now &#8212; they don&#8217;t want to have to field &#8220;why didn&#8217;t you resign Ron?&#8221; questions.<br />
Following dinner, we broke into small groups to watch movies. Some in the Banff Park watched &#8220;Planes, Trains, and Automobiles&#8221;, some were supposed to gather in the Skyline to watch &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; (but never did), and a couple of us took up shop in the dome of the Skyline to watch the director&#8217;s cut of &#8220;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&#8221;. We were at home again. For the next two days and three nights, our last on the train, we would live as we had started &#8212; on the railroad.<br />
We were heading into New Brunswick, and our second-to-last province on this trip.</p>

Day 23<br />
I haven&#8217;t been in Quebec City for 17 years. The last time I was with the Society for Educational Visits and Exchanges in Canada (SEVEC), in the summer following Grade 8. One of the great things about old cities is that they don&#8217;t change quickly.<br />
Today was the event day at the Gare du Palais, Quebec City&#8217;s train station. Normally, this would mean an early start, a lot of work, and a teardown. But plans over the last few weeks had meant only a half-hour&#8217;s worth of work before, and maybe an hour&#8217;s after. This was now a Radio-Canada affair, and our team&#8217;s presence was not required. We ended up with an unexpected day off.<br />
Once the official word came that we were not needed, our group disappeared to the four winds. Some went to Vieux Quebec, some back to the hotel, some to various other parts of the city. I immediately headed towards Chateau Frontenac. It&#8217;s a landmark I felt comfortable enough to branch out in search of familiar things. The tricky part was getting there. (Sans taxi, of course.)<br />
For the first few minutes, I climbed hilly streets I did not recognize. I rounded bends and turned corners I didn&#8217;t remember. Then, at the end of one street, I spotted a McDonald&#8217;s. It was the first time I&#8217;d ever seen a McDonald&#8217;s without one of the giant arches, 17 years ago. I was getting close.<br />
I turned more corners, and began to realize that my memory wasn&#8217;t as good as I&#8217;d believed. I knew I was in the area, but my recollection of where I was going proved to be fuzzy. I found an alley lined with the work of starving artists. Nothing really remarkable to see, but it sparked a faint memory. I quickly skirted around viewers and buyers. About five metres from the end, I slowed down.<br />
A deep feeling, long forgotten, swelled out. It was like frost growing across a cold window, only warm and familiar. I was 13 years old, walking out of the same alley, meeting up with my friends in the square next to Chateau Frontenac. We were on shopping sprees in Basse-Ville, I was buying a kite in a store at the foot of the staircase, eating at the McDonald&#8217;s, running around the Plains of Abraham and looking over the walls of the Citadelle. I was listening to the Art of Noise, wearing all-white clothes, making my first (rather poor) attempts at dating. A youthful grin swept across me.<br />
I knew where everything was, though I could name little of it. Down Terrasse Dufferin, up the stairs to the Plains of Abraham, around La Citadelle, over to the Parliament Builings, and through the St. Louis Gate. It was all familiar, and completely new. Seventeen years vanished, and I was discovering everything for the first time again. I decided I needed to visit La Citadelle.<br />
Quebec City is North America&#8217;s only walled city. La Citadelle is its fort, and is the largest fort in North America. It&#8217;s also still an active military base, something I had not remembered. (You can&#8217;t just wander around it, like at Fort Henry in Kingston, or historical towns like Black Creek Village.) It was a quiet day inside the walls, as most of those on staff were either hard at work, or away for the weekend.<br />
La Citadelle, although originally a French fort and (obviously) based in Quebec, is a British establishment. When the Wolfe defeated Montcalm at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the British took control of the fort, and greatly expanded it. Today, it&#8217;s North America&#8217;s largest. It is also one of the homes of the Governor General of Canada &#8212; a permanent residence is maintained for when Ms. Clarkson spends her time here in Quebec. (It&#8217;s mostly a political move so that the second-highest politician of the nation &#8212; after Queen Elizabeth &#8212; doesn&#8217;t show favouritism for English Canada.)<br />
Leaving the battlements behind, I returned to the Chateau to head into the Lower Town (Basse-Ville). The stores and restaurants have changed (except the sex shop, which looks like the same one I&#8217;d seen 17 years earlier), but the landmarks were the same. While taking a picture of l&#8217;Escalier Casse-Cou, I heard my name called from below. I found Bill and Bill, enjoying beers at one of the restaurants on the stairway.<br />
The tour took me through Lower Town, long the narrow cobble-stone streets, and slowly back up the hill. I rounded UniversitÃ© Laval, along the walls, and eventually back to the railway station. The event was in full swing, and I wanted to see what Radio-Canada was doing in our place.<br />
The activity was high. Our tents were in front of the station, filled with Radio-Canada information, manned by Radio-Canada staff. The line to see the train ran from well inside the station, out the front doors, and up the garden path. The show outside was loud &#8212; cheerleaders and gymnasts cavorted to bad pop music. Daryl was filming, and seemed to have the same poor view of the show that I did. Radio-Canada had pulled together very little content &#8212; it almost looked like a high-school science fair. But everyone seemed to like it, so I guess it worked out in the end.<br />
Inside, people waited patiently to see the museum. Out on the platform, VIA &#8220;entertained&#8221; visitors with loud music, smoke machines, and special lighting. It almost felt like a nightclub. This was the first venue, I think, where visitors didn&#8217;t really have much of a choice of where they went. It was carefully mapped out to go through the Renaissance cars first, and then through the museum.<br />
Neil, Julie, Analisa, Debbie, and Rose remained to help Radio-Canada. I only saw Neil, Julie, and Rose. They were unsure of the event, as none of them spoke French well enough to determine how people were enjoying themselves. (We later found out that the line&#8217;s length was due to how long people were spending in the museum. Most of our visitors have walked through in 12-15 minutes. Some of the visitors in Quebec City were reading everything. There&#8217;s a lot of text in that museum.) I saw only a few people leave the line and give up on seeing anything.<br />
As I was available, I was quickly tasked with a simple job: take more ballots out to the information table, and a lavender pillowcase to clean out the now-full ballot box. The staff out front didn&#8217;t know who I was at first. I managed to explain I was there to help. The new ballots did a lot to support that. I emptied the ballot box, as the volunteers there were quite busy.<br />
Several people started asking me questions. In French. I couldn&#8217;t understand a word. I felt ashamed. I took French in school for nine years. In those nine years, I never learned to carry out a full conversation without asking for help. Over a decade later, I could barely make out a simple sentence. One of these days, I&#8217;m either going to move to Montreal for a year, or maybe even Paris.<br />
I returned to the hotel to ease my weary feet. I don&#8217;t know how far I&#8217;ve walked today, but it&#8217;s not a short distance. It&#8217;s been a while since my feet have hurt this much. After all the standing, walking, hauling, and what-not, I thought my feet would be conditioned to this sort of abuse. I ended up falling asleep for an hour. Quite enjoyable, I must say.<br />
When I returned for teardown, the event was already long over, and the only thing left were the tents. The technical crew were already hard at work. Although the rest of the team has become quite skilled at assembling and taking down tents, it&#8217;s something else to watch the professionals. They make it look easy. Bill C. doesn&#8217;t even use the Magic Prybar (the tool the rest of us use to pop the tent canvas of the frame) &#8212; he pulled it out like someone would tighten shoelaces.<br />
We packed up the tents and took them back to the baggage car. The stanchions and tables were already put away. Then it was off to dinner. Some went one way, others another. Several of us headed up to Rue St-Anne in Vieux Quebec for a Swiss-styled dinner. Neil, Emma, Analisa, and I stayed only long enough for a drink. We&#8217;d sort of already had an idea to go somewhere else, but thought we&#8217;d at least give the restaurant a shot. But the service and menu didn&#8217;t thrill us. We bolted for something more significant.<br />
At the railway station.<br />
We had hoped to meet up with others at Charbon, a steakhouse in the railway station. We ended up meeting up with Daryl, who had arrived well before us, and had mostly eaten alone. While the four of us ate our meal, Daryl enjoyed a post-meal chat and apperatif at an adjacent empty. Marc, Tracy, Trish, and Cliff appeared later on, but sat away from us.<br />
After dinner, most returned to the hotel before heading out onto the town. I returned to Vieux Quebec. I wasn&#8217;t about to let a perfectly good night go to waste. Not when there were photographs to be taken. (Can you tell I&#8217;m a little obsessed about photography?) Following a route similar to this morning&#8217;s, I circled the old part of town. Tourists were in bed, as were the locals. I saw no more than 20 people the entire time, and perhaps no more than 35 cars.<br />
I finally had to pull myself away and return to bed, close to 02:00. As much as I love this city, I didn&#8217;t want to stay up all night.</p>

Day 22<br />
Were it not for banging pipes in the ceiling (I wasn&#8217;t the only one who heard them while at that hotel), I might have slept in longer. As it turns out, the noise got me moving a little faster, giving me more time in the day. We weren&#8217;t leaving town until after 17:00, which meant lots of time for us to see Montreal.<br />
The technical crew (except Rob W., who was back in Toronto taking his kids to see &#8220;The Who&#8221;) left early this morning for Quebec City. They&#8217;re helping out with a broadcast using the tents we&#8217;ve been carrying in the train. (A Radio-Canada truck drove the tents out last night.) So today, it&#8217;s just the production staff.<br />
Most of us had saved money to spend in Montreal. No longer Canada&#8217;s largest city, it still reigns as the fashion capital. It seemed everyone wanted to go shopping. Well, except me. Today was my day to be an outright train geek. I intended to spend the day out of town, in Delson/St. Constant.<br />
For railfans in Canada, Delson/St. Constant is almost a kind of Mecca. It&#8217;s the home of the Canadian Railway Museum. Some of Canada&#8217;s most famous pieces of railway history are preserved there, awaiting discovery by the rail-curious. Ever since getting involved with the railway community, this was a trip I&#8217;ve wanted to make. When I was granted the honour of assisting with the CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train, and the schedule permitted, visiting the CRM became a personal priority.<br />
Getting out to Delson/St. Constant was a challenge. It&#8217;s a bit of a distance out of the city. The &#8220;Museum Train&#8221; didn&#8217;t seem to be running, and public transit is completely out of the question. Naturally, I figured on a rental car. The nearest rental outlet, a Budget, was cleaned out. Calling around, I found nary a rental car was available in Montreal. That meant only one thing: a taxi. Worse still, my driver didn&#8217;t know where St. Constant was, nor had ever heard of the museum (admittely, not entirely unsurprising). And the CRM&#8217;s website had a vague map, but no details. (It turns out that the map is surprisingly accurate.)<br />
A taxi ride from downtown Montreal to the distant outskirts is about $40. And that&#8217;s travelling on highways, with me navigating from the back seat. The museum itself is not visible from Route 209 in St. Constant. The only indication is Old Sydney Collieries 2-4-0 #25 that sits next to the road. A little further down is a sign that provides the real clue. Follow a short dirt road, round a corner, and the transplanted Hayes railway station comes into view.<br />
I stopped at the ticket booth to purchase admission. The clerk cheerily said that admission today was waived for some cultural event. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what that meant, but free is always good! I headed on in, and made a beeline for the main station house and information centre.<br />
Founded in 1932, the Canadian Railroad Historical Association is Canada&#8217;s oldest and largest historical railway organization. In 1950, the group took possession of its first piece of equipment, a retired Montreal streetcar. Nine years later, there were enough artefacts to open a museum. The Canadian Railway Museum was founded in 1961, and opened its doors in 1965. Currently, the CRM is working on an expansion called ExpoRail, which will provide a greater interpretive experience for those visiting the museum.<br />
The museum currently consists of a large rail yard, ringed by an electrified rail for streetcars (they circle the museum, offering patrons rides). There are two stations at the museum, Hayes station near the entrance, and Barrington station at the opposite end. It is with some interest that I discovered that the Hayes station is named for, you guessed it, Charles Melville Hayes. The same guy whose middle name gave Melville, SK its name. The railroading world is a small one &#8230; and thankfully, without the singing dolls. Obtaining information at the information centre in the Hayes station, I quickly hustled down to the Barrington Station for my tour. The group also consisted of a model railroading group from Kingston.<br />
Our tour took us only through the locomotive house, which was pretty much all we wanted to see. I had hoped that the guide would have extensive knowledge on the locomotives, where they came from, how they got here, and an interesting story or two behind them. The tour guide, sadly, wasn&#8217;t terribly knowledgeable in railroadiana. She knew the items we were looking at, but history beyond that, or of other items in North America she knew little. The modellers and I frequently added in extra information. (I frequently corrected not only the guide, but also the modellers. It scared me to realize just how much about trains I&#8217;ve learned in the last year and a half.)<br />
The tour over, I returned to taking pictures. In the locomotive house are some of Canada&#8217;s most famous steam locomotives, including CN 4100 (the first locomotive the newly-formed Canadian National Railways ordered, and the last Santa Fe type steam locomotive remaining in Canada), CP 2850 (the original Royal Hudson that towed the Royal Train in 1939), The Flying Scotsman (donated to the Dominion of Canada in 1937 by Britain), and CP 5935 (one of two remaining Selkirks, the largest locomotives ever used on Canadian rails). It&#8217;s a steam buff&#8217;s paradise. There were also two vintage diesels in the house: CN 77 (CN&#8217;s first diesel electric, and possibly the oddest locomotive I&#8217;ve ever seen), and CP 8905 (the last remaining &#8220;Trainmaster&#8221; locomotive in the world).<br />
I wandered around the yards, taking more pictures of equipment sitting in the yard. More steam locomotives sat out there, along with the majority of diesel electric locomotives. The diesels were mostly in good shape, a few that need restoration. I had to be a little watchful while walking around &#8212; the museum was running an active steam engine, a replica of the John Molson, back and forth on one of the open sections of track. (Most avid steam fans in Canada don&#8217;t really regard the John Molson as a part of the collection. It is a replica of the original, built in 1970 for use at the museum. I&#8217;ve heard it referred to as a &#8220;toy&#8221;.)<br />
Most of the museum&#8217;s collection is in good order. Some of the items need painting, some a serious overhaul. Some other items in the collection, sadly mostly steam locomotives, are harder to look at: they are decayed, and probably barely salvageable. They sit in a nearly-hidden side track, down a path marked with a forbidden entry sign. It&#8217;s sad to look at these once-proud machines, knowing that with funding they could have been saved.<br />
As I wandered, I learned that today was an auspicious day for the museum. According to the modellers (I kept running into them), in addition to it being a cultural day, there was a large announcement at 14:00. Luckily for me, that fit almost exactly into my schedule. Well, it ended up fitting into my schedule. Originally, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be able to stay that long without becoming bored. I suppose trains are pretty good at keeping my interest.<br />
If any press attended the speed, I couldn&#8217;t tell. As most of it was in French, I also don&#8217;t know exactly what was said. I do know enough French to get the gist. Today was the official launch of a new book written by and for the museum. It&#8217;s a collection of portraits and text about the museum&#8217;s collection. As soon as the speeches ended, the book went on sale in the giftshop. I bought the first English copy.<br />
I called my cab (the driver had given me his number), and waited for his arrival. This game me ample time for a snack (an ice cream cone &#8212; all I could find), and read my new book. Returning to Montreal, I had the taxi driver drop me off on the waterfront, near the entrance to the Lachine Canal. The sunlight cast wonderful shadows on the massive concrete grain elevators, and the rust on the metal portions exhibited classic industrial decay. And I wanted pictures.<br />
Near the mouth of the canal was a large inukshuk. Unlike normal ones, this was made from &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t actually know. It&#8217;s hard to tell. It looked like a large wire mesh that contained peat moss, with grasses and small plants sprouting from all over. I can only assume that this was the original intention. Walking down towards the hotel, I found an old tugboat that had once plied the waters. An excellent black and white subject. I ran into Daryl along the way, returning from an excursion of his own around Montreal. He was off to find an external hard drive for his computer. I continued taking pictures almost until I got back to the hotel.<br />
We congregated in the hotel&#8217;s lobby. It seemed everyone except me had gone shopping during the day. I get the feeling many of us will be mailing packages home just so we can zip up our luggage.<br />
Around 17:15, when we departed for VIA&#8217;s Montreal Maintenance Centre. This was also when we ran headlong into traffic. Why the traffic was so heavy downtown Montreal on a weekend escaped us. But we had to escape it. The train would leave without us if we didn&#8217;t arrive on time.<br />
I would love to have given everyone on our trip a GPS transmitter so we could have plotted the cabs. I can only imagine the scene of half a dozen taxis bombing around the city streets, weaving in and out of traffic, travelling a labyrinth of side streets. We all eventually merged back together as we arrived at MMC.<br />
Our last VIA crew was there, waiting for us. We&#8217;ve had three crews already. Some long lived (Vancouver-Winnipeg), some very short (Winnipeg-Toronto). We were greeted with cards left on every berth and on every door. They are certainly off to a great start!<br />
We pulled out of Montreal, watching the glowing skyline as we crossed the Victoria Bridge. We didn&#8217;t want to leave &#8212; Montreal is far too exciting a city to stay for such a short time.<br />
The trip from Montreal to Quebec City was fairly brief. We arrived around 23:00, pulling into the Gare du Palais. It was a much faster arrival that previous stops. Probably because we didn&#8217;t split the train or do anything else fancy. We just wanted off. Grabbing our bags, we headed off, yet again, to a hotel. All these hotels are beginning to weigh on us, I think. There is a certain consistency to our train bunks.<br />
We had to wait a long time for a cab. When one finally showed up, one of the priorities was to get Stefani in it. She was carrying Bill C.&#8217;s insulin, which he&#8217;d accidentally forgotten on the train. A few mildly concerned phone calls during the day had given us the impression that he needed his medicine quickly. As we drove, we spotted the technical crew walking back from one of the local bars. Bill didn&#8217;t seem as relieved as we&#8217;d expected.</p>

Day 21<br />
We came. They saw. It rained.<br />
I&#8217;d been looking forward to the Montreal event. This is a great city to be in, and I was sure lots of people would come out. We were so certain of ourselves that there was nothing that could dampen our spirits.<br />
Except the remnants of Tropical Storm Isidore.<br />
When we&#8217;d set up this morning, we were prepared for rain. We all knew it was going to rain. The precipitation forecast was at 100%, and the predictions were quiet accurate. We laid down tarps, hung the tent walls, Roger even went out and purchased two large bags of disposable ponchos. We planned the whole day around it raining. And for a time, we were wholly successful.<br />
Je ne suis pas bilingue, and I&#8217;m not the only one. Luckily, this was well-known ahead of time. Our local organizers provided fully bilingual volunteers, and the Archives staff who&#8217;d come to Ottawa came out again to run the show, for which I&#8217;m eternally grateful. When we arrived this morning, Radio-Canada arrived armed with signage, posters, and French-language video tape loops aplenty. (We gather the signs were very hastily made after Radio-Canada saw all the English signs in Ottawa, the batch finishing sometime early this morning.) In fact, there was so much help that once we&#8217;d set up the tents and equipment, we had little else to do.<br />
Some of us, like Cliff, even got kicked out of our own tents.<br />
Our set up this day was in Vieux Port (&#8220;Old Port&#8221;), the old shipping port on Montreal&#8217;s waterfront. Some shipping (mostly passenger) still runs out of here, but mostly it&#8217;s for touring and viewing the river. A freight rail line still runs through the area, which is what our train sat on. We were warned to look for trains, but never saw one the entire day.<br />
The schools arrived early, as expected. Into the museum, and around through some of the tents they went. Organized and quiet, I saw little of them &#8212; I&#8217;m not even sure they came by the Nouveau MÃ©dia tent.<br />
The buzz on the walkie-talkies soon turned to Sheila, specifically Heritage Minister Sheila Copps. I had expected to see her in Ottawa. Instead, she made her appearance in Montreal. Her first visit was to the museum, as expected. I hovered around outside, waiting for a chance to take a picture. Ms. Copps travelled with an entourage that was a little difficult to shoot around, but not impossible. I followed her from the train to the Children&#8217;s tent, to the New Media tent, over to the Boutique, then through News (although I couldn&#8217;t get a decent angle for the picture), and finally to Sports. I didn&#8217;t bother with the radio interview.<br />
I must say that Ms. Copps&#8217; ability to speak French is impressive. For a Hamiltonian who used to do an excellent job of riling southern Ontario, she&#8217;s become a very respectable politician &#8230; if there is such a thing. She spent a lot of time talking with our staff (although I think it was limited mostly to Ivan, Patrick, and Amy &#8212; the local organizer steered Shiela from certain tents quite quickly).<br />
Light rain was falling by the time I got back to the New Media tent. It wasn&#8217;t yet something to worry about, just something to watch. We did partially close one of the walls as a precaution. The writing was on the wall, though &#8212; rain was coming. It was just a matter of time.<br />
The Radio-Canada staff and volunteers were running the tent like they&#8217;d been with us from the start. (Not that there was a lot to do, however &#8212; we weren&#8217;t exactly overwhelmed with visitors.) Like most of the others, I had little to do. Most of the people coming up to us were Francophone, and they wanted to talk to Francophones. My French is too poor to be of use, so I kept my distance. No-one seemed to mind.<br />
The downside of not speaking the language was an inability to obtain feedback. Normally, I&#8217;ll talk with visitors and hear what they liked and disliked. I felt quite awkward asking Radio-Canada staff questions in English, let alone our guests. I was able to learn from others such as Ivan that those who did come were thrilled with the presentations.<br />
The ground that the Boutique sat on was turning into a pond &#8212; the water pooled almost right under the tent itself. Though the merchandise on the counters were fine, the stuff in boxes was getting more than a little damp. In what would be their shortest stint out in the open, the Boutique closed before lunch, and everything packed and put back on the train. They would not be the last tent to go down.<br />
Lunch was another problem. (VIA wasn&#8217;t with us today &#8230; well, our crew wasn&#8217;t with us. The Renaissance crew was out, but we rarely saw them during the show.) Analisa improvised and ordered from St. Hubert. She described it as &#8220;Swiss Chalet, but French&#8221;. That, it ain&#8217;t. It&#8217;s food, and I wasn&#8217;t about to complain. There was the issue of the order, though &#8212; specifically, how long it took to arrive. It was almost like a comedy of errors. Analisa placed the order, and we expected delivery. About 30 minutes later, we heard over the walkie-talkies that a guy in a chicken car was at the front entrance. He wasn&#8217;t delivering, though &#8212; he was comfirming the order. Another three-quarters of an hour pass, and finally the delivery arrives. Well, sort of. Someone reported that the chicken man was back, but then no-one could find him. The walkie-talkies started squaking and running afowl of chicken jokes.<br />
During one of my stints in the New Media tent, an unfamiliar face introduced himself to me &#8212; Koceila, my new tent partner. Koceila was with the Radio-Canada Archives project, and would be running out the remainder of the trip with us. Koceila is Franophone, which is something I&#8217;m ecstatic about. Quebec City, Campbellton, and Moncton are either Francophone, or bilingual. I can&#8217;t handle that on my own. And like I&#8217;ve said before, I need someone who is passionate about the Archives site.<br />
Koceila would not be joining us today, though. All he came out for was to install his visual aid into one of the laptops (Koceila has a slight visual impairment &#8212; the aid magnifies printed text with the use of a hand-held scanner). For the previous week (since about the 21st), we&#8217;d been trying to find out what laptop Koceila was supposed to be using. Brenda was not aware of any extra laptop for Archives, nor was I. The mystery was eventually solved when Analisa announced it was hers. So I let Koceila and the technician he brought loose on the laptop to install a PCMCIA card and the optical reader. An hour later, the two had to give up. Our laptops are all Windows 2000, and the drivers for the reader are Windows 95. Koceila said he&#8217;d get along without it.<br />
Just after noon, Isidore paid a visit to Vieux Port. The rain fell harder, and things that had previously been dry started to get wet. The partially-closed wall in New Media was sealed shut. Other tents drew walls as needed. The Children&#8217;s tent put the mural away for fear of damage. (It later came back out under shelter.)<br />
People kept coming. While I spoke with none, the Radio-Canada staff made them all feel welcome. Giveaways always seem to bring out the best in people. That, and dry shelter, which is what the tents offered. Many patrons lingered longer than in most places. I somewhat doubt the possibility of keen interest. The Archives site remained the big feature, as expected. Of course, that was on the &#8220;open side&#8221;, so was also easiest to see.<br />
The rain continued to fall. Debbie came around asking what state the New Media tent was in. I wasn&#8217;t worried, at least not aloud. The water concerned me, but the event was going too well to stop it. I couldn&#8217;t help notice the mud along the edges of the tarp on the ground, and new that it would eventually start seeping under the tables. The computers would be fine &#8212; they sat on top of their packing boxes. But the cables were exposed. I&#8217;d put them on top of a crate earlier in the day, though that really didn&#8217;t matter. Water and computers don&#8217;t mix.<br />
By 15:30, it was officially over for New Media. Water was now almost under the tables, and there were no signs of the rain letting up. The call came over the walkie: &#8220;Strike New Media&#8221;. While I wasn&#8217;t happy about it, I knew there was no choice. Daryl appeared in the tent only moments later to get my reaction on tape. I think I was polite. (I was frustrated, but not by any decisions that were made. It was the weather I didn&#8217;t like.) By the time the last computer was loaded back on the baggage car, water had crept under the tables.<br />
Shortly after New Media started coming down, the other tents shut down. By 17:00, the tents were coming down. By 18:30, the only thing left standing was the New Media tent. Canada Now had appropriated it for a broadcast (which required four of us to carry it, fully assembled, through a garden to put it into place. Only the museum cars were still open.<br />
We were soaked. Not quite as bad as Windsor, but it was a deeper soaking &#8212; sort of like leaving really dirty dishes in the sink overnight. We were cold, wet, and wanting to go back to the hotel. Once the last tent was down, just after 19:05, and the last of the items packed back in the cars, we broke for a hot shower and dinner.<br />
Some took a taxi, but a fair few of us wandered through the rainy night back to our hotel. It felt so good to peel off the layer of wet clothes. My shoes popped off like suction cups. I almost instantly climbed into a shower that ran a good 10 degrees hotter than I usually can stand, just to restore the heat in my body. A warm, dry change of clothes certainly helped. I also had to dry my soaked shoes, as I didn&#8217;t really have anything else suitable to wear. (It&#8217;s amazing what 20 minutes with a hotel hair dryer can do.) Those of us heading out that way piled into cabs and disappeared into the night.<br />
Next up on the table was dinner. Rose suggested we hit a restaurant that let you bring your own wine, a fairly popular concept in Montreal. I don&#8217;t fully remember where we ended up. It was an area of town with a lot of neat little restaurants. Definitely not a heavy tourist area. We each purchased a bottle of wine at a nearby depanneur (I could already feel a hangover coming on), and headed to our restaurant. Rose almost immediate suggested we leave &#8212; this was a restaurant she knew too well. We went to the one across the street. There were a fair number of us (those that I can recall include Neil, Julie, Rose, Roger, Emma, and I think Analisa), but we were the only ones there. Fine with us.<br />
Isidore left town before midnight. With the rain gone, Montreal glistened like a gem. It could have been perhaps our best event, were it not for the weather. It&#8217;s days like these when I wish we had more than one public event in each city.</p>

Day 20<br />
Today was a travel day. It seems a bit odd, since Montreal is so close to Ottawa. But that&#8217;s the schedule. We weren&#8217;t about to complain. After an 18-hour marathon event yesterday (getting up to going to bed, that is), a day in travel was something to look forward to. Especially when we get to travel during the day.<br />
Arising earlier than needed, I took the opportunity to wander around Ottawa, specifically the Parliament Buildings. Having lived in Ottawa before, I&#8217;d been to Parliament Hill many times. I needed pictures for the website, and also for myself (you never think to do tourism in the city you live &#8212; it&#8217;s not until you live somewhere else that you wish you had pictures). Clear mornings are the best for catching colour.<br />
I got my requisite pictures of the Parliament Buildings, and proceeded to wander around. My original plan was to go around back, shoot the library, and maybe across the river. But as I rounded the West Block, I spotted something I&#8217;d never seen before.<br />
In a fenced-area area off to the west side is something called &#8220;Stray Cats of the Hill&#8221;. Since the 1970s, cats have lived in protected seclusion, in a custom-built dog, er, cathouse. (I suspect the current cats are either descendants of the original stray cats, or are new additions.) Today, the &#8220;Catman of the Hill&#8221; maintains the house and feeds the animals (it is in no way associated with the Federal Government, in case you&#8217;re worried that your hard-paid tax dollars are going to the dogs, er, cats). An interesting thing to find while prowling the Hill.<br />
Heading back to the hotel, I managed to catch the Supreme Court of Canada building in perfect morning sunlight. The only thing that would have made it better would have been if the roof had corroded enough to turn green. Replaced only a few years ago, the copper roof had only turned a dark brown. The green won&#8217;t show up for a few more years still.<br />
We headed over to the train station at 10:30. There we had to wait for our train to become available. I asked John when we could get on, and he replied that there had been a minor complication with the train, so we were a little late. I was curious to know. At first, he wouldn&#8217;t say, but it doesn&#8217;t take much to get one railfan to tell another railfan what was going on. Apparently, someone had accidentally left the brakes on the P42 (#907) when returning from the museum during the night. The wheels were gouged, making the engine incapable of travel.<br />
Somehow, I considered this poetic justice for the grief VIA had wrought on us since the Renaissance Train had joined us.<br />
We boarded the train at Ottawa&#8217;s VIA Rail station around 10:45. We would not depart the station for a little over an hour, assumedly waiting for clearance on the track. As we started onto lunch, we began our journey to Montreal. Less than 10 minutes out of Ottawa, we heard the following announcement:<br />
&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, the helicopter is now overhead. You can obtain a clear view of it through the Skyline dome.&#8221;<br />
Daryl had arranged the helicopter in question. This had been a shot Daryl wanted since we left Vancouver. Ideally, it would have been in the Rockies. As we were travelling at night, the helicopter shot would have been wasted. Out of Kamloops, it rained. Saskatoon to Melville would have been excellent with the clear weather, but for some reason, all helicopters run from Melville, and the cost would have been exorbitant. Northern Ontario was deemed unsuitable, mostly due to timing. This, it seemed, was our best (and last) chance.<br />
Originally, Daryl was to shoot from the helicopter himself. He had asked me if I&#8217;d like to come along. (Actually, it was more of an assumption than an inquiry.) Due to problems getting from the helicopter to the train, and due to cost, an Ottawa CBC camera operator flew in Daryl&#8217;s place. I am a little disappointed that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to go, either.<br />
As I couldn&#8217;t get pictures of the train from the helicopter, I opted for pictures of the helicopter from the train. But playing cat and mouse with a helicopter is no easy feat. I wanted a clear shot of the helicopter, preferably with the cameraman. Unfortunately, the train, the terrain, the vegetation, and the pilot didn&#8217;t always agree with me. I took at least 30 pictures, trying to get a nice, clean shot. In the end, it was a lucky shot out the vestibule window.<br />
We covered the short distance between the two cities fairly expediently, arriving in Montreal roughly on time. (I can only assume we made up the time as VIA wasn&#8217;t really interested in getting us any more ticked off than we already were.) We had to run out onto the Victoria Bridge over the St. Lawrence River, before backing into the VIA&#8217;s Montreal Maintenance Centre. Our event tomorrow needs only part of the train, so some will be left behind here. The rest will be taken down and arranged for us. (I assume it&#8217;s too awkward to take our entire train to the Montreal station.)<br />
Our train parked next to the American Orient Express, a very pricey luxury cruise train that makes curcuits of Canada and the United States. The cars on the train are similar in vintage to ours, but underwent an extensive (and expensive) refit to make them some of the most luxurious ever to ride the North American rail system. But even with all the glamour, I&#8217;d take our train in a heartbeat.<br />
Piling into a line of awaiting taxis, we headed to our hotel in Montreal&#8217;s Chinatown. We had a few hours to spare. We also had few rooms to check into &#8212; most of us had to store our bags and wait for the rooms to become available. After checking in, we all wandered off to see what we could see. I love this city. I&#8217;d love to spend more time here. It&#8217;s energetic, it&#8217;s always interesting, and has some of the most beautiful buildings, streets, artwork, and people I&#8217;ve seen. The only thing better than Montreal on a sunny day is Montreal at night.<br />
The entire group had been invited to a club that night for cocktails, all arranged by &#8220;Mr. Punctual&#8221; Fred. The only problem was that this place had a dress code: No jeans, and no running shoes. That immediately negated me, and probably a dozen other people. We hadn&#8217;t really carried such clothes with us &#8212; we never saw the need for it, and utility was more of a concern than appearance. Although I suppose I should have planned for that to some degree, considering that we were going to Montreal, and at least one night was likely to be fancy over the course of the trip.<br />
Ivan and I decided to wander a bit and see what we could find. The goal was to track down a deli. The delicatessens in Montreal, although legendary, are nowhere near where we went, I think. We walked down towards Notre Dame Cathedral, east to Jacques Cartier, and couldn&#8217;t find a single place that even remotely looked like a deli. Not being completely familiar with Montreal, I can only assume the delis are more towards the original Jewish quarter of the city.<br />
We ended up choosing a somewhat-touristy restaurant on the edge of the boulevard. Like most of the other restaurants we saw, they featured mussels and chips. (Apparently, it&#8217;s a common French dish. I&#8217;ve never seen it before.) Neither of our meals were extraordinary. When you&#8217;re hungry, you don&#8217;t really mind.<br />
After dinner, we headed back to the hotel. Ivan was very patient with me &#8212; I was stopping every so often to take pictures of the city at night. When we arrived back at the hotel, Ivan headed upstairs &#8212; I went back out to take more pictures. I didn&#8217;t stay out too long, though. This stupid cold I&#8217;m harbouring is making me feel a tad icky. I turned in a little early (even when many others were heading out to some great club somewhere) to get this thing out of my system.<br />
I ran into Stefani at the entrance of the hotel. She and Bill C. are running out to join the others at a club &#8212; a different one than everyone started off at. She was a little baffled at the picture I was taking of &#8230; well, traffic. I was interested in lights. I love light. And moving light is a personal favourite. I had to show Stefani and Bill what I was trying to do. Both suggested that I put my camera away (I wonder if everyone thinks the same thing) and join them. The thought of going out is very tempting, but I can just see this cold turning into something worse.<br />
There are times I hate being responsible.</p>

Day 19<br />
The tech crew had a really early call this morning &#8212; they were at the train long before the rest of us. They had to make sure that everything was ready with the museum cars before the schools started showing up at 08:00. We arrived by 07:30 so we could finish setting up tents and prepare for the expected deluge of people.<br />
Terri, Elizabeth, and I began our set up almost immediately. Once shown how to set up one computer, they handled the remaining eight. That gave me time to find all the missing equipment and boxes. This is a constant problem. Although we generally pack things in the same place every time, the smaller items (the ShowVote ballots, bookmarks, pens, mousepads, and bags) have legs and are always moving around. It never fails: I always spend about 30 minutes looking for this stuff. Strangely enough, though, I kinda like it.<br />
As the last of the computers were hooked up, three strangers arrived at our tent. Francois, Genvieve, and Christiane, from Archives at Radio-Canada in Montreal. They had come out to represent their interests and assist us with our display. Although at first confused (I wasn&#8217;t aware they were coming), I was very happy to see them. I didn&#8217;t want to travel the rest of Canada without an Archives expert, and they were all bilingual. (Ma francais n&#8217;est pas bien.) And although I had put in a request to make sure I got a French-speaking volunteer, we had a problem getting any.<br />
Apparently, Brenda did know they were coming, but because of the hectic pace at which things were set up, she simply forgot to tell me. It wasn&#8217;t a big deal &#8212; having them there was a blessing. I hate running the Archives without someone who actually knows it. Debbie was amazing at promoting the Archives &#8212; she&#8217;d make a great salesperson. Francois, Genvieve, and Christiane were also exceptionally good, and answered virtually any question someone asked. I&#8217;d be really curious to know if the traffic to the Archives site goes up as a result of this trip.<br />
The floodgates opened when the school busses arrived. I have no idea exactly how many busses there were, but we had more children before noon than we&#8217;d had people at both our Windsor events combined. Unlike our Winnipeg event, there wasn&#8217;t the chaos. Teachers ruled their students with iron fists and kept them all in check. Busy, but manageable. Everyone went away with smiles.<br />
Well, almost everyone. Although I didn&#8217;t encounter this woman directly, we received a complaint that we were completely unorganized when it came to children&#8217;s activities. This had all of us confused. The Children&#8217;s tent has always contained activities for children, and all of our tents are child-accessible. Unfortunately, I never heard specific faults or what we could have done better. The only thing I could think of was that someone had expected actual events, like you&#8217;d find at museums (e.g. a &#8220;scavenger hunt&#8221; for information). Emma and Stefani have enough on their hands without running something like that.<br />
Another visitor, a former employee of CBC, had warned us of a potential flood of people starting around 17:00, when offices were out and people started rushing to see the museum. It was a wise piece of advice, although there was little we could do to prepare for it. The rush never came, though. As noon turned to afternoon, the flood turned to a steady flow, trickling off in the last two hours.<br />
The schools had primarily brought their students to see the museum. But some schools decided to make a little more of the excursion. (In other words, they planned the activities.) One class of students, from Riverview Alternative, were embroiled in a journalism contest. They were tasked with interviewing the CBC staff for their projects. When one of them found out I work for CBC, I was suddenly surrounded by inquisitive faces.<br />
Okay, technically, I&#8217;m only a contractor. I&#8217;m not a full employee. But for the purpose of this trip, I was told very clearly by Brenda that I am a CBC employee, and I should always say that when asked. My actual contract doesn&#8217;t say anything like that, so I can only assume it&#8217;s to keep an air of consistency. It&#8217;s fine with me. Actually, I still find it quite an honour to be asked to help Canada&#8217;s national broadcaster in such a way. It&#8217;s almost like giving back to the company that gave me so much. (Almost &#8212; I still think I&#8217;m getting more out of this than I&#8217;m putting in.)<br />
The first student was Peter. He had a list of questions, starting included my name, how long I&#8217;ve worked for CBC, what I like most about the events we do, and if I&#8217;d ever interviewed a student before. I answered all his questions (though I answered &#8220;I&#8217;ve been involved with this project for three months&#8221;, rather than say &#8220;I&#8217;ve been with the CBC for 25 days&#8221;), giving him time to write down his answers. Being one not miss a golden opportunity, I turned the tables. (Besides, it looks good for these journals.)<br />
Peter, like those surrounding me, was from Riverview Alternative. Not wearing my thinking cap, I neglected to ask the grade. (As I&#8217;m not a journalist, my ability to ask questions off the top of my head is a little weak. It&#8217;s a skill I&#8217;ll need to work on.) Peter&#8217;s class had come to the museum on a field trip to see the CBC 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train. Peter was also interested in seeing who would win the journalism contest. When asked what career he was working towards, he replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m working on that&#8221;.<br />
Bent down on one knee, I was shorter than the children surrounding me. I had hoped it would make me more approachable. Either that worked, or these kids were really keen to be interviewed.<br />
Taking a selection at random, I picked a girl named Samah. She asked me her questions, then I asked mine. Also in Peter&#8217;s class, Samah was here to see the train. Unlike Peter, she didn&#8217;t seem too preoccupied with the contest. I added a new question this time: what have you seen so far? (I wasn&#8217;t sure if they&#8217;d been through the museum.) Samah had already been to the Children&#8217;s tent, and had particularly liked the bubble table. (She said her class would see the train after lunch.)<br />
A forest of hands accompanied with cries of &#8220;me next!&#8221; presented a problem &#8212; too many choices. I opted for Hanady, the next nearest person. She, like Samah, also liked the bubble tables most, but had also seen the New Media displays. I was quite happy to hear that. Hanady&#8217;s wish for later life is in law enforcement.<br />
At that point, I had to call a stop &#8212; as much as I would have loved to interview them all, it would have taken too long. Though disappointed, they understood. One last boy, whose name I regrettably did not write down, asked for an interview. Very articulate, he asked the questions much in the matter of a television interview &#8212; clearly, and with deliberate articulation. At the end, he thanked me for my time, and even shook my hand. I see a future for him in journalism.<br />
Performances from the stage came on and off all day. This included Anthony Maclean with Infomatrix, some from Wayne Rostad with On the Road Again, and of course, Frank Leahy and Friends (which we think will be their last performance with us &#8212; though there is a little hope of them coming to Halifax). One was from the Royal Canadian Air Farce. We&#8217;ve seen them several times now since leaving Vancouver. Their energy impresses me. (Mind you, the energy of the train crew impresses me far more. The Air Farce has only been out to some of our shows. We&#8217;ve had to do all of them, yet we still smile and are as energetic with every new person as we were with the first ones in Vancouver.) But it&#8217;s getting tiring &#8230; especially Luba Goy. Her duck impression is, well, annoying. And when she&#8217;s &#8220;Really On&#8221;, she doesn&#8217;t know when to stop.<br />
Because there were six of us manning the New Media tent, I was able to spend more time wandering around the site. Radio-Canada made an effort to bring local television talent, especially from children&#8217;s shows. It was easy to snap pictures of them interacting with children. That also set me up as a target for Radio-Canada.<br />
I was approached by one of the Radio-Canada staff &#8212; she wanted some pictures taken, primiarly of the local talent they brought in. But then they snuck in one more thing: They wanted pictures taken of all the signs. Why? One reason (at least that we can discern): All the signs were in English. Much earlier in the project, the management team had asked Radio-Canada for input. As none was ever received, the signs were printed only in English. Radio-Canada, at least from what I could gather, was not pleased. I can only gather they wanted the pictures for evidence. The request, however, was countermanded when Rose and Julie came up to me and asked what was going on. There&#8217;s nothing like getting caught in the middle. Making a decision wasn&#8217;t too hard, though &#8212; I report to the English side of CBC.<br />
Once the schools began to depart, the site quietened down. This allowed more time to talk to those who came to the New Media tent. All of them were so happy we had come. Three women were looking for the Royal Canadian Air Farce, and were a little disappointed to hear they&#8217;d missed hearing them on stage. A man, who couldn&#8217;t be any older than myself, was almost crushed when I wouldn&#8217;t reveal what was really inside Mr. Dressup&#8217;s Tickle Trunk. (If people only knew that it contains Duffy&#8217;s tools.)<br />
As I wandered back from my late lunch, Daryl pulled me aside to meet a man, retired for 14 years. He has read my journals online, which brought back memories of riding in the Banff Park car, when it had been with Canadian Pacific Railway. This man was another early pioneer, having helped build the microwave network from Winnipeg to Vancouver, through the Crowsnest Pass. He seemed almost misty-eyed when telling stories of raising a 300-foot tower on top of a 3,500-foot mountain in the middle of the night, when the winds didn&#8217;t howl. Of the journey on which we are embarked, he had this to say:<br />
&#8220;You can&#8217;t appreciate it if you&#8217;ve never seen it.&#8221;<br />
I think this is the first real sign of a big problem we&#8217;re all going to have when we get back to &#8220;reality&#8221;. Sooner or later, we&#8217;re all going to get the question: &#8220;What was it like?&#8221; I have no idea how I&#8217;m going to answer that. We&#8217;ve done so much and seen so much that it completely escapes me how to explain it. I&#8217;m a big fan of experiences &#8212; some of my favourite trips have been insanely paced, much like this one. But they&#8217;re short, usually less than two weeks. It&#8217;s a little easier. But this is so completely beyond my abilities that I have no idea what I&#8217;m going to do. I guess the only thing I can hope for is that there will be a documentary on this.<br />
Of the tasks I had set myself to accomplish, one was to take a picture of ex-CPR 1201, a Pacific-class steam locomotive currently housed by the museum. The last locomotive built by CP&#8217;s Angus Shop in Montreal, #1201 had been protected from the scrapper&#8217;s torch by the locomotive crews. (The story goes that when CP started looking for the locomotive, they could never find it &#8212; the crews kept moving it around and hiding it.) I wanted a photo of this locomotive. However, it&#8217;s stored in the Science and Technology Museum&#8217;s warehouse, and is not open to the public. I had hoped to eek my way through with the curator, but couldn&#8217;t connect with him in time. Serves me right for waiting to the last minute.<br />
Instead, I settled for pictures of ex-CN 6400, the last of five streamlined Northern-class steam locomotives (sometimes referred to as Confederation class); and of ex-CP 3100, one of only two Northern-class locomotives built for Canadian Pacific. They are beautiful examples of Canadian steam locomotive engineering.<br />
As afternoon crept along, I gave my friend Rebecca a call. Although I&#8217;d seen her and her family a scant couple of months earlier, I had hoped they might be able to come out and see the train. However, a few phone calls back and forth pretty much kiboshed the idea &#8212; too many things going on, and the traffic wasn&#8217;t really accommodating at that time of the day.<br />
Twelve hours passes a lot faster than you might think. We had what I think was our best event yet. So many people came out to see our show, and so many walked away with memories anew and renewed. Before we knew it, the sun was setting, and our tents illuminated from the lights within. The crowds were thin. Slowly, we started to pack ourselves up.<br />
Long days such as this can really wear one out. But though we were tired and exhausted, there was the feeling of success. We had gone through the longest day on our schedule without serious complications or complaints. There had been the odd hiccup, but nothing more serious than anything we had dealt with before &#8230; not counting Winnipeg.<br />
When the call to break came, everyone bolted for the line of taxis waiting for us. It almost seemd a race back to the hotel, though why I&#8217;m not sure. I bade farewell to Terri and Elizabeth, as I don&#8217;t expect to see them tomorrow. It was across the street again for a post-event celebration. We&#8217;re getting good at these.</p>

Day 18<br />
Ivan and I met arrived at Union Station at almost the same time, but from opposite ends of the GTA. Both of us had taken the GO Train to downtown. We met, as planned days earlier, under the clock in the centre of the Union Station upper atrium. The arranged meeting time was 9:15; Ivan and I were a good 45 minutes ahead of schedule (mostly due to how frequently the GO Trains run in the morning &#8212; though for me, it was also making sure I was punctual). We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Harvey&#8217;s while we waited.<br />
One by one, people slowly began to arrive. Sometimes in twos, but usually individually. While we were waiting around for more people, Daryl pointed out a book on sale at an adjacent kiosk. It was a photography book whose subjects were railroad-oriented (not necessarily trains). The pictures were mostly black and white. All of them were strangely mesmerizing &#8212; things you wouldn&#8217;t normally think to take pictures of. And for $10, you certainly can&#8217;t go wrong!<br />
The crew had almost all arrived by 9:15, at which time we headed into the train. Although everyone who could go home (a few of us live out of town) enjoyed sleeping in their own beds and being with family, every second utterance I heard as we climbed aboard was &#8220;it&#8217;s good to be home&#8221;.<br />
Many of us, including myself, are now fighting off a cold. Illness spreads quickly when people are in confined spaces for long lengths of time. (That, combined with lack of sleep and lots of stress, usually do a number on the human immune system.) Luckily, it&#8217;s nothing serious, just your run-of-the-train kind of rhinovirus. More annoying than debilitating.<br />
We said farewell to Jason, Debbie, and Ingrid in Toronto. This morning, Lisa joined us to take Jason&#8217;s place. Hopefully she won&#8217;t feel too excluded from our group &#8212; I suspect it won&#8217;t take long for her to blend in. We have no replacement for Ingrid, and I&#8217;ll be on my own until we get to Montreal. For a while, I&#8217;ll know how Cliff must have felt in the first couple of weeks, before Trish joined us.<br />
The trip to Ottawa was fairly expedient. I&#8217;d taken the train between Ottawa and Toronto only once before, but that was on an LRC from Ottawa. This time, I rode in the Skyline dome, watching the world pass by in a way I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d see. We were eating lunch when we passed through Kingston. We waved at the dozens of people who lined the platforms waiting for us to pass through<br />
Our trip up the Alexandria Subdivision (Brockville to just south of Ottawa) took a little longer than planned, mostly due to a rail traffic jam. The Alexandria Sub is single track, and if one train is late, it throws the entire schedule off. We ended up a little behind schedule arriving at the Ottawa station. Unfortunately, we never recovered that time. Due to depart the station around 18:00, we didn&#8217;t end up leaving until almost 19:00. (I have no idea why.) At an agonizingly slow speed, we shunted around Ottawa until we could back up the spur to the Canada Science and Technology Museum. While it was torture for us, the train chasers who lined our route must have loved the slow pace.<br />
Arriving over two hours late at the museum, we had to wait while VIA spent over an hour shunting the Renaissance train. The tension level on our train skyrocketed to an all-time high. Even the agony of Winnipeg seemed a dull ache compared to the fury rising in many people. The CBC staff and our VIA crew were about ready to start breaking windows and jumping from open doors. It wasn&#8217;t so much that we were stir-crazy, but that stupid Renaissance train has been putting us behind schedule consistently since we picked it up on the 19th.<br />
Although we never admitted to it publicly at the time, we were ready to do something nasty to the Renaissance train. Something that would prevent it coming with us for the remainder of the trip The delays were intolerable, and inexcuseable. This was supposed to be our show, not VIA&#8217;s, and their constant delays were causing us to miss schedules and inconvenience everyone.<br />
Finally, four hours after we were to start our partial set-up (tents and kiosks), we detrained and proceeded to quickly unload the baggage car. In just over an hour, we erected all the tents, and were ready to finish our set up the following day. We ended up having to do more work than we should have, but mostly because we had to make sure that the museum would be ready for operation in the morning &#8212; the schools would start early.<br />
Taxis started arriving not shortly after we finished, and we all headed to the hotel to check in. Being a complete idiot, I left my wallet on the train. This made checking in a little more difficult. (It would also make going out troublesome.) I wouldn&#8217;t be able to access any services, but I could at least shower and sleep that night.<br />
The phone in my room already had a message. Terri and Elizabeth, from New Media in Toronto, are joining me for the 12-hour event tomorrow. I&#8217;m very thankful they&#8217;re coming. Doing this with two people is difficult, let alone one. Stretch that over 12 hours, and I&#8217;d be about ready for a long stay in a rubber room by the end of the day.<br />
We broke for a late snack at a pub across the road. I had to beg and borrow due to my lack of foresight (see my wallet comment). Despite all the grumblings earlier in the day, everyone seemed to be in good spirits. In fact, we seem to be really positive about tomorrow&#8217;s event.</p>
