	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s only so much rain you can take before you start to go a little strange in the head. It has rained here nearly every single day since 1 Nov 1998. We&#8217;ve had about 10-15 days in that stretch where it didn&#8217;t rain, and about five days where we actually saw that big bright yellow circle in the sky. And Heaven forbid we should think that the colour of sky is anything but grey!<br />
Thus, I need not explain why Allison and I wanted to see something different for a change.<br />
So we went to Seattle.<br />
Why Seattle? Simple &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t been there before. It would be a change of pace, and (hopefully) something out of the ordinary. After all, you can only stare at the 33 walls of your apartment for so long&#8230;<br />
We piled into the car bright and early Saturday morning, maps in hand, and headed for the border (with a brief pit stop at McDonald&#8217;s to ease the rumblings in our stomachs). The traffic at the border was a bit heavy, but neither of us were too upset. It took only a few minutes to traverse the border, convince the US Border Patrol we were harmless, and be on our way.<br />
The trip to Seattle is about three hours, depending on how bad the traffic in Seattle is. (And even on a weekend, it&#8217;s pretty bad.) The trip&#8217;s a little dull too &#8212; the terrain is pretty flat. The rain and fog obscured all the interesting things to look at, so we had to entertain ourselves in conversation.<br />
I regularly find it amazing that despite all the time Allison and I spend together, we can always find new things to talk about.<br />
When we arrived in Seattle, we arrived in Seattle traffic. I hadn&#8217;t seen traffic that heavy since I lived in Oakville and drove into Toronto. And this was a weekend! Rush hour must be a complete nightmare.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we spotted the Space Needle, and went about figuring out how to get off the I-5, and into the city. Luckily, Americans are fairly good at marking signs. We exited the I-5, and found our way to Mercer Drive. This cuts a somewhat quasi-diagonal path through the north-eastern end of town, taking you by the Expo &#8217;62 site (complete with that so-called &#8220;tower&#8221;, the Space Needle), and eventually putting you near the waterfront. Arriving on Elliott Street, we turned left and proceeded to attempt to find parking.<br />
Folks, if you decide to drive to Seattle, make sure you have small American bills when you arrive downtown. Parking there is expensive (often brutally so), and unless you have small American bills, you might find it very difficult to find a place to park. A lot of the lots require you to place a rolled up bill into a slot. Other take the bills and issue a ticket (and have major problems with CIBC VISA cards).<br />
After nearly an hour of trying, we eventually found a lot where we could park for US$8. We weren&#8217;t exactly ecstatic about the price, but we didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The immediate agenda after that was to find lunch.<br />
By the time we finished eating at a cheap (albeit not only in price, but also in quality) Chinese restaurant, we decided it was time to actually go see *something*. So we walked up a street, turned a few corners, and arrived at Pike&#8217;s Place Market. Or rather, the staircase going up.<br />
Seattle is quite hilly. It&#8217;s not as hilly as San Francisco, but it&#8217;s much hillier than Vancouver. There are several staircases running from the waterfront to the top of the hill. (I would learn later that there was a reason for all that.)<br />
Once we reached the top (a little winded from all the climbing), we headed into the market. Pike&#8217;s Place Market (also known as the &#8220;Public Market&#8221; if you see the huge neon signs) has been there for quite a long time. It has just about every imaginable shop, selling fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers (fresh and dried), home-made chilli, doughnuts, flying fish, stained glass &#8230;<br />
Flying fish? Oh yes, there are flying fish in Pike&#8217;s Place.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s a store called Pike Place Fish, and they have a rather interesting method of getting the fish from the ice-packed display to the packers behind the counter.<br />
They throw them.<br />
I kid you not. You&#8217;ll suddenly hear a loud: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; from a large guy dressed in orange hip waders, quickly followed by a chorus of people behind the counter, all shouting: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; (they do this for every order, fish or otherwise), followed by a real large chinook salmon, flying through the air, from the large guy dressed in orange hip waders to another person behind the counter.<br />
Needless to say, this attracts a lot of spectators, most of whom want to see the flying fish. Apparently, sales are more brisk during the summer. (Tourists are such gullible people.) You can check them out on the Internet, at <a href="http://www.fishthrowers.com/">http://www.fishthrowers.com</a>.<br />
After viewing the sailing salmon, we continued our way down the length of the market to see what objets d&#8217;art were available. Most of it was produce, which is not at all a bad thing &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing like smelling fresh vegetables and fruits and flowers.<br />
Towards the end of the market, we came across a table where a man was selling home-made stained glass kaleidoscopes. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have stopped were it not for the fact that a neighbour of my family in Oakville makes almost the same thing. The design of the simpler kaleidoscopes was almost exactly the same, and the more complicated ones were very similar. (My family&#8217;s neighbour is one up on this man, though &#8212; he makes a binocular kaleidoscope that is just a wonder to see.)<br />
I made some quick inquiries. The cheap triangular scopes were about US$30. The more complicated ones with dials and spinning vials of beaded glass were about US$50, and the really nice pieces were US$120 and up. My family&#8217;s neighbour could probably make a killing&#8230;<br />
Reaching the end of the market, we hopped across the street and entered the Mecca of the West Coast &#8212; the original Starbucks Coffee Shop. Founded in 1971, it&#8217;s served countless cups of caffeine to the masses, and marketed itself into world dominance.<br />
They screwed up our cups of hot chocolate. They forgot the whipped cream.<br />
After walking around a little and snapping a few pictures, Allison went to purchase a dried garlic and flower wreath for hanging on our kitchen wall. (We needed a little more decoration in there.) Not wanting to carry the fragile decoration with us for the rest of the day, I quickly ran it back to the car.<br />
Upon returning to Allison, we headed down 1st Street to Pioneer Square, the original centre of Seattle, and the location of Doc Maynard&#8217;s. We were in search of the Seattle Underground Tour.<br />
What&#8217;s underground Seattle? Rocks, mud, a few bodies, but mostly dirt. All except for a 22-block area in Pioneer Square, what was originally Seattle.<br />
As we would learn over the course of the tour, Seattle used to be built on mudflats. No problem with that, except that twice daily your house flooded. It got worse when they installed Crappers (toilets as they were known in the 1890s) &#8212; twice daily, toilets on the flats would explode, creating six-foot high geysers from the &#8216;loo. Not exactly the sort of thing you want.<br />
To solve a large number of problems, the citizens did the only thing they could &#8212; they burnt the city to the ground. Okay, they didn&#8217;t actually do that on purpose, it kind of happened when a glue jar caught fire. It fell onto a turpentine-soaked floor. Of a shop built mostly of wood. The next door neighbour was a warehouse &#8230; filled with whiskey. I think you get the idea&#8230;<br />
The first ordinance passed required that all buildings be made from 60% non-flammable materials. Luckily for the town, the mayor owned the local brick works.<br />
One of the next things they did was plan to raise the roads. Chuckholes (essentially a killer pothole) were becoming so bad, the only way to solve the problem was to literally cover the roads &#8230; with upwards of 32 feet of soil. So they began to solve the problem, by raising all the buildings, then raising the road, then building the sidewalks.<br />
Sound a little weird? Well, that&#8217;s how Seattle got its underground. When the roads were raised, there were huge gaps between the road and the buildings. When those gaps were eventually covered with a sidewalk, the areas underground were abandoned. That was 1907. It wasn&#8217;t until the 1960&#8217;s, when local historian Bill Speidel opened the underground for a tour. Because of his efforts, the Underground (and the surrounding area) is now a protected historical area.<br />
At least, as much as Americans will actually protect that kind of thing &#8230; especially when there&#8217;s a profit to be made by paving over paradise, and putting up a parking lot.<br />
The tour was pretty cool &#8230; the tunnels aren&#8217;t heated. Sorry, cheap joke. We learned a lot about Seattle and its history, not to mention saw a lot of how Seattle was built one hundred years ago. It&#8217;s really fascinating &#8212; I recommend it to anyone going there.<br />
Following the tour, Allison and I went back to retrieve our car. Unlike all the other parking garages with reasonable hours (i.e. they never close), ours shut down at 20:00. Not exactly what I&#8217;d call convenient.<br />
After driving over half the city trying not to listen to Allison telling me the correct way out, we hopped back on the I-5 and headed towards home. We had thought about staying the night, but when you took into account that hotels cost about US$90 a night, we thought of all the other things we could do with that $90, and opted to go home.<br />
The following day, we rose a bit later than usual (we were a little tired from our journey), and started to plan out our day. We thought it might be interesting to go through Lynden, the Dairy Capital of Washington State.<br />
Why? Why not? (Also because we thought that the Tulip Festival might be on, although we couldn&#8217;t find any confirmation of that.)<br />
After looping through Lynden a few times, we came to the conclusion that the town was really boring (nearly everything was closed) and we opted to have a bite to eat, and leave.<br />
One note to travellers to Lynden: Don&#8217;t eat at Bob&#8217;s Burger and Brew (I swear I&#8217;m not making the name up). Just trust me on that.<br />
Just as we began to leave Lynden, the weather started to act strange &#8212; heavy rain, very dark clouds, hail, and thunderstorms. One of the things about BC weather &#8212; it&#8217;s usually pretty tame. This was way out of the ordinary, and it had me a little worried &#8212; it looked like tornado weather. (Although I&#8217;m told we can&#8217;t get tornados here, the weather patterns seemed just ripe for an ol&#8217; Kansas vacuum.)<br />
Returning to Canada again, we headed into Surrey to find an area called Cloverdale. Inside Cloverdale is a subdivision (whose name has totally escaped me) that has Victorian-style homes. This has, apparently, become a popular trend in homes. After a little driving around, we stumbled across the subdivision, and drove in.<br />
Very nice homes, and it really looked like a nice neighbourhood. It&#8217;s the sort of place I&#8217;d like to live. But the original subdivision was all sold about a year or two ago, so we couldn&#8217;t actually check any of the places out.<br />
Luckily, there was a new phase being built just next door. There were two show homes available for viewing. All I can say is &#8212; very impressive. Allison and I were thinking we could skip going to Europe, and we could get jobs in Surrey (well, *I* could get a job in Surrey), and we could buy.<br />
When reality finally sank back in, we acknowledged that while we&#8217;d love to live there, we had too many other things we wanted to do first, and Europe was one of them. It was by far the best designed house we&#8217;d seen to date, and it had a lot of design features that we wanted to include in ours. Maybe one day&#8230;<br />
At any rate, we&#8217;re back to working on our lives. Hopefully, our next big adventure won&#8217;t be far away!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;d always thought that the &#8220;Welcome Wagon&#8221; was a euphemism for a group of well-natured people who would come to the door of folks new the the neighbourhood and welcome them into the community. Little did I know that Welcome Wagon is actually the name of a corporation that organises events and earns a profit (or so I assume &#8230; why else would a company have &#8220;Ltd.&#8221; as part of its name?).<br />
Welcome Wagon Ltd. organised a bridal show in Nanaimo on Sunday, and Allison&#8217;s mom thought it would be a good idea if we went over to see the show. Not so much to make arrangements (we&#8217;re still working on an actual date), but to get ideas for the ceremony and for the following reception.<br />
This meant we had to catch the 8:30 ferry from Horseshoe Bay, which meant we had to be up no later than 7:15. I crawled out of bed at 7:13. Allison followed at about 7:16. We were out of the apartment by 7:28, and the car had hit the road by 7:32. We arrived in Horseshoe Bay just after 8:00, where our next little fiasco took place &#8212; finding a place to park. This is the single hardest thing to do there, because parking is at an absolute minimum.<br />
The BC Ferries lot was full, that I expected. However, the nearby Impark yard was also full. I started to worry a little. But Allison knew of a lot over by the Boathouse. It was for Sewall&#8217;s Marina (it allowed no overnight parking as a result), but you could get a spot for the day, which it what we did. After I parked the car, I ran down to the machine to get a ticket. It was one of the older machines, which spat out a ticket at a time (for each $2.50 inserted). Ideally, it would do the same as the other machines I&#8217;ve used and let me pop in my VISA card.<br />
Nada.<br />
So I ran back to the car. I had made the mistake of wearing pants that morning, without dumping the financial contents of my shorts pocket first. (In other words, I had no change.) I got some change from Allison (which was a relief), bolted back down to the machine (the parking lot was on a hill), and tried to purchase three tickets. Except the stupid machine would only sell them using specific combinations of coins. I had only enough for two. So I had to run back up to the car, get another quarter, run back down to get a third ticket, and then run back up again. By this time, I was almost out of wind, and worried that if we didn&#8217;t hurry we&#8217;d miss the boat.<br />
Having not enough cash was a minor problem, so I ended up having to buy tickets with my VISA card. (At least that time it worked.) When we boarded the ship, we made a beeline for the cafeteria lineup. We were starving. BC Ferry food has a tremendous reputation for being horribly awful. We opted for the safest (and cheapest) thing on the menu that would see us through the day &#8212; a western croissant. The egg was at best egg-like, the croissant was like plastic &#8230; at least the hashbrowns were edible.<br />
Arriving in Nanaimo just after 10:00, I came to notice something &#8230; my keys weren&#8217;t in my pocket. In fact, I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. Suddenly, I had a flash &#8212; in all that running back and forth to the machine, I had forgotten my car keys in my ignition. In my car. In Horseshoe Bay. On the other side of the Georgia Strait.<br />
I was suddenly not feeling so well. At some point, I need to sell my car. It&#8217;s costing me too much money to keep around, and if I can get a few thousand for it, then I can pay off most of my debt. But if someone stole it because I had mistakenly left my car keys in the ignition, then I would be severely screwed. Living away from home is sometimes not at all what it&#8217;s cracked up to be.<br />
Arriving at the Collins&#8217;, I made a hasty call to the West Vancouver Police, hoping that they might be able to do something &#8212; it would, after all, be crime prevention (not to mention idiot protection). But the constable I was speaking with suggested I call BCAA (the British Columbia Automobile Association). I thought it was a great idea. So I dialed the number, and explained it this way:<br />
BCAA: BCCA, how can I help you?<br />
Me: Hi! I did something really dumb &#8212; I just realised I locked my keys in the car.<br />
BCAA: No problem, we can get them out. Where&#8217;s your car?<br />
Me: Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver.<br />
BCAA: Great! And are you with the car?<br />
Me: Well, there&#8217;s the problem.<br />
BCAA: Why?<br />
Me: I&#8217;m in Nanaimo. I just came in on the ferry.<br />
BCAA: And your keys are on the mainland&#8230;<br />
Me: Right.<br />
BCAA: Oh boy&#8230;<br />
There was the problem. BCAA required someone to be at the other end to hand the keys to (BCAA was not allowed to hang onto the keys). There&#8217;s a problem living here &#8212; I haven&#8217;t met many people, certainly a very small number whom I&#8217;d consider friends, and no-one I would consider good enough to drive all the way out to Horseshoe Bay to collect them. (Sometimes I really hate the fact that I left all my friends behind at home.) However, the BCAA operator thought that maybe the BCAA attendant could put the keys under the front seat. This was a great idea, in my opinion &#8212; Allison had a spare key we could get into the car with, and we&#8217;d be able to drive off with no problems. This was assuming, of course, that they could find my car. You see, I couldn&#8217;t tell them my license plate number &#8212; I didn&#8217;t know what it was. I knew my Ontario plate, but for the life of me I couldn&#8217;t remember my BC plate. So I had to give them a detailed description of the car. Luckily, there aren&#8217;t many cars in BC that look exactly like mine. That issue resolved, we sat down to eat before heading off to the bridal show.<br />
The show was at Beban Park, not far from the Collins&#8217;. Almost the entire show was arranged around the brides &#8212; there was almost no acknowledgement whatsoever of the fact that men even existed and were part of the process. Allison and I had a long discussion about this later on. It boils down to the wedding industry (and believe me, there is a very strong industry out there) brainwashing women to having extravagant weddings costing thousands of dollars. Allison had originally hoped to do the whole thing for $500. I knew that it would cost us about $2,000 and that&#8217;s about where we&#8217;re budgetting.<br />
We were there for research. Each table added another idea to the pot of things that we had to consider for our wedding. The biggest thing on my list was decoration. Although it is wonderful that we can get a hall in Nanaimo for a very low price (i.e. nothing), it&#8217;s not exactly the most attractive place. So I took the time to look at photographs and look at the displays to determine what we could do. That&#8217;s not to say that I wasn&#8217;t looking at anything else &#8212; I scribbled about three pages worth of notes, varying from wedding invitations to colour schemes.<br />
I was feeling horrible during most of the show. I&#8217;m convinced the eggs I ate on the ferry were making me feel ill. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling all that great either. And two fashion shows of women&#8217;s gowns was putting me out like a light. Even the overly-loud music wasn&#8217;t doing me any good.<br />
During the various raffles, Allison won a ring-bearer&#8217;s pillow. This little event changed our plans a little, and we thought we might end up using it. However, it would necessitate a few changes to our plans. At first, we thought having one of Allison&#8217;s little cousins would be a neat idea &#8230; then we scrapped it, remembering the financial input required for such a detail. The pillow would remain unused.<br />
I had thought that after the show, we&#8217;d head back to the ferry and we&#8217;d go home. But the Collins wanted to have dinner with us, especially since the Vailette&#8217;s (Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents) wanted to see us. (They had expected us the day before and had a small reception waiting for our arrival.) We dined on vegetarian lasagna (quite tasty, mushrooms aside), with a delightful cake for dessert. Allison and I had to then run for the ferry.<br />
Most of the way back, I kept hoping that my car would still be there when we arrived. I wasn&#8217;t looking forward to the prospect of having to deal with the police and ICBC to report a stolen car. As we entered the parking lot, I couldn&#8217;t see where my car was &#8212; a large white van blocked my view. But as I rounded the van, I was ecstatic to see my car in place. As expected, the keys were under the front seat.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, this is why you should get a BCAA membership &#8212; for those times when you&#8217;re hopelessly screwed, and you desperately need help. If you never use it, you might curse the expense &#8230; but the moment you need it, you&#8217;ll thank your lucky stars that you bought it. I consider mine well paid for.<br />
I grabbed my keys, popped them in the ignition, and &#8230; nothing happened. In all the running around, I had forgotten to also turn off my headlights. The battery was stone dead. Off I went again, running around to find someone with jumper cables or who could let me borrow their phone to raise BCAA again (the stupid 800 number doesn&#8217;t work in the lower mainland and I didn&#8217;t have a quarter to make the call).<br />
I lucked out with The Boathouse, a seafood restaurant at the foot of the parking lot. There I found a very kind waitress (originally from Saskatchewan) who offered to give us a boost. I was appreciative beyond words. A few minutes later, the car was running and we were on our way home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend just passsed was the BC Day long weekend (for those of you back in Ontario, that&#8217;s a fancy way of naming the Civic Holiday) &#8212; we get the first monday in August off to enjoy the weather and get out a little more than we usually do. We took the opportunity to visit my relatives in Kelowna.<br />
I dropped Allison at work on Friday morning, on the intention to pick her up Friday afternoon so we could leave Vancouver immediately. This didn&#8217;t work exactly to plan, because Allison ended up starving all day due to lack of money with which to buy lunch. We ended up postponing our departure until after we&#8217;d eaten.<br />
Then it was down Knight St. in Richmond to the 99 East, under the intention to cross the Annacis Island bridge, down to Highway 10, turning to Highway 1, finally ending at Route 1 (aka the Trans-Canada Highway). The only problem was that I missed the turn-off for the bridge, thus setting us back about 10 minutes. (And after all the problems I had with Los Angeles a week earlier, I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly good about it.)<br />
Route 1 was packed in a few places with morons slowing down traffic for no good reason (like there&#8217;s such a thing as a good reason), but soon we were whistling our way east. After an hour or so, Allison and I had to stop to make use of a washroom. Regretibly, there were no washrooms available &#8230; we had to make use of the local foliage to disguise ourselves.<br />
Climbing back into the car, I glanced at the fuel gauge &#8230; it was at less than 1/8 of a tank. I had left with over half a tank, thinking that it would be enough for the trip. I had never driven my car through the mountains before, and I was beginning to think that my car was going to be a little more trouble than I would have liked.<br />
By the time we arrived at the Coquihalla Toll booth, I was worried. My stomach was knotted, and I really didn&#8217;t want to hear what Allison would say if we had run out of gas. Fortunately, I do have BCAA (the BC version of AAA), but when you&#8217;re stuck in the middle of nowhere and your significant other is breathing fire, you really can&#8217;t defend yourself with a tiny piece of plastic.<br />
I asked the toll attendant where the nearest gas station was, foolishly assuming there would be one nearby. &#8220;Lessee, that would probably be Merritt, about 16 kilometres away.&#8221;  That is what I heard. This is not quite what she said. I figured out what she said a few minutes later, when I saw a sign that said: Merritt 62km.<br />
I about had a heart attack. Allison was going to kill me if I ran out of gas. For the next 45 minutes, I used every trick in the book to keep from running out of fuel: Travelling at 90km/h, shifting into neutral when going downhill (periodically running the risk of getting a speeding ticket at the same time), and not slamming my foot on the gas pedal. I breathed a very audible sigh of relief when we arrived in Merritt under our own power.<br />
Allison was annoyed that I hadn&#8217;t told her, but she was quick to point out that it was a no-win scenario for me &#8212; she would&#8217;ve been peeved no matter what had happened, so I got lucky in that she was only annoyed, and not ready to deprive me the ability to reproduce.<br />
After fuelling up, we stopped at the A&amp;W so we could get something to drink (we were thirsty) and so I could call Aunt Alaine and Uncle Dave and let them know we were running late. They didn&#8217;t seem too surprised, and I told them we&#8217;d be about an hour and a half late. They seemed to concur with that estimate.<br />
We arrived at their door about 23:30 that evening. Already in the driveway were Uncle Dave&#8217;s car complete with the boat on a trailer, and Uncle Mike&#8217;s truck with the camper trailer behind it. We squeezed into the last space remaining, and quietly got out.<br />
Our arrival was not unnoticed &#8212; Maggie, the Znack&#8217;s (Uncle Mike, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jennifer) dalmation, began a barking fit as I passed. This woke Uncle Mike, but not Jennifer (strangely enough). Brenda was somewhere in the house.<br />
The next day we started off with a big breakfast, and then opted for an excursion down to the launching ramp to put the boat in the water. When we arrived at the ramp, we found that most of the boating population of Kelowna had done the same. It turned out that the most popular place to view the Thunderboat races (which were the thing to see that weekend) was on the water.<br />
As we waited to launch the boat, Allison decided it was time for Jennifer and I to bond. She got Jennifer to tickle me. Yes, I&#8217;m ticklish. Jennifer loved it. Frankly, so did I, if for only one reason: I got to know Jennifer as a result. Jennifer was born in 1989, thus making her 17 years younger than myself. (This isn&#8217;t the fault of her parents, but considering Aunt Brenda is about 14 years younger than my mother, it does explain a few things.) Every time I had seen Jennifer before, she was either too shy, or I was too wrapped up with other things to really get to know her. I thought this was great, personally. I get along very well with all my cousins, so getting to know Jennifer better was a definite asset.<br />
Finally, we got to launch the boat. Not a huge event, but rather important before you can go out on the lake. It was then I found out that we were to go for a ride. This presented a problem &#8212; Allison doesn&#8217;t like small boats. She gets seasick rather easily. I offered to take the car back, which is the best thing we could do. I figured that even the trip back to the beach near the Tisdale&#8217;s (Uncle Dave and Aunt Alaine) would be troublesome for Allison, and I wasn&#8217;t really interested in pushing her luck. Dave handed me his keys and told me to take the car back.<br />
I thought to myself: &#8220;Well, at least now we can see how Geoff can drive with a trailer.&#8221; No problem, I thought. I can handle it. When we arrived at the car, we had a smaller problem &#8230; I noticed that where there should be a shifter for the automatic transmission, there was in fact a shifter for the manual transmission. I had never really driven with a manual before. I had always wanted to learn, but the opportunity had never really presented itself.<br />
Well, all things considered, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. Yes, I did stall the car a couple of times when I tried to get going, but it was (so I found out later) because what I thought was first gear was actually third. (The shifter in Volvos apparently ain&#8217;t so great.) We managed to arrive back at the Tisdale&#8217;s in one piece, and with the transmission intact.<br />
There we found out that the rest of the troupe, save for Nana (my mother&#8217;s mother), had also gone out. The dictate was: Be at the launch for 14:00. Allison and I took the opportunity to get a few things that Allison needed. The first thing was contact lens cleaner, which apparently had emptied itself that morning. The second thing was Gravol. Allison was going to make an attempt to go boating.<br />
Despite the cola she had drank to counter the extreme drowsiness brought on by the Gravol, Allison had a hard time staying away. But finally, we got onto the boat, and took a trip out into the lake. Lake Okanagan is quite warm, and shallow in many places. But it is deep in others &#8212; the bridge crossing the narrow part of the lake is so deep that it wasn&#8217;t feasible to build concrete supports into the lakebed. As a result, the middle portion of the bridge floats.<br />
That evening, we had barbecued tiger prawns. I&#8217;ve become accustomed to eating prawns now, and can usually stomach them if there is no alternative. But don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;ll still order something else if I have the option.<br />
The following day, Allison and I opted not to travel around Kelowna with my relatives, but instead decided to travel down to Penticton to visit with Allison&#8217;s friend Kelly (whom I knew). Although Kelly lived in the lower mainland (about 30-45 minutes from our apartment), bad timing had prevented us from all getting together for a long time.<br />
The plan was to travel down the canal that runs from Penticton a few miles south. You pay $10, they give you an innertube and they pick you up at the other end. However, there was a minor problem on this fine (and hot) day: The water level was too low. This meant we could only go half the length we could normally have gone. The three of us discussed this, then decided that this was not such a good idea. So we spent the afternoon at the beach instead.<br />
When Allison and I returned to Kelowna, we didn&#8217;t immediately return to the Tisdales. Instead, we went to check out a planned community called Kettle Valley. It was amazing. The houses looked just like the ones I had wanted to own for years. The prices weren&#8217;t all that bad, at least when compared to Vancouver.<br />
That evening, we had a vertible feast back at the Tisdale compound. Mike and Brenda had brought a rather large chunk of beef from Alberta, which was roasted to utter perfection on the barbecue. To match the meal, we had glasses of Okanagan valley wine, which had completely won over Uncle Dave (this is an important detail, because until that point he had only liked a specific brand of French wine). Dinner was fabulous.<br />
The following day was our departure. After another huge breakfast, we made a somewhat hasty exit &#8212; we were the first out of the driveway (the Znacks and Nana were also leaving), but I doubt we were the first out of Kelowna. Allison and I dawdled about Kettle Valley a bit longer, and then through the city, stopping briefly to pick up some aspirin to tackle Allison&#8217;s earache.<br />
By the time we arrived in Merritt, we were ready for lunch. We didn&#8217;t want to eat at a fast food restaurant, so we tried the ABC Country Restaurant (part of the ABC Family Restaurant chain). After a wait that even Godot would have been amazed at, we finally got our at-best-mediocre food.<br />
We effectively lost and hour and a half eating lunch. We were now at a disadvantage for arriving in the lower mainland ahead of the traffic. We hopped back on the Coquihalla, and I headed south, hoping to beat the pack.<br />
After a couple of hours, Allison needed to pull over for a while. She was on the sunny side of the car, and was beginning to develop heat stroke. At one of the places where the Coquihalla River passes under the highway that bears its name, we stopped for a rest. We climbed down to the river to play a while in its cool waters. There we wasted even more time building a small dam from the available rocks to create a wading pool.<br />
By the time we reached Hope, we had lost all hope of making it without the traffic. Allison was not in a good mood as a result of the heat, and I was getting a little annoyed myself. So we ended up leaving the Coquihalla and drove north on Highway 9 in search of Highway 7 (otherwise known as the Lougheed Highway), which would take us within spitting distance of our apartment.<br />
Allison was convinced this was not such a great idea, but I had a little more faith in the general stupidity of others. Aside from a backing up of traffic where Highway 7 and 9 met, the flow was smooth and non-stop right to Willingdon Rd., which we took south to get home.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today I severed the last vestages that tied me to my birthplace. This morning, I went to the local CAA chapter (known as BCAA), and turned in my car&#8217;s license plates. I thus separated myself from the suit-and-tie ideals of Toronto, and became fully enveloped by the sandal-wearing hedonism that thrive here on the west coast. I guess I am truly now a British Columbian.<br />
On the weekend, Allison&#8217;s parents came out to the Lower Mainland for Father&#8217;s Day. Originally, Allison and I were going to Vancouver, but Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well enough to travel, so her parents offered to come over.<br />
They came over Saturday morning, which was when we had decided we were going to make a couple of purchases. We got up early (for a Saturday morning after a Friday night where we stayed up late cleaning up) and headed to IKEA and Home Depot. The idea was to purchase a table and chair set (which IKEA sold for a surprisingly low $229) and a barbecue. We needed both, since we were currently using Allison&#8217;s card table for a dinner table (and while it was a nice card table, it wasn&#8217;t terribly strong), and, well, hey &#8212; everyone needs a barbecue!<br />
But it took us too long. I ended up having to drop off Allison at the Patterson SkyTrain station so she could meet her parents downtown, while I took our newly-gotten booty home and into our apartment, followed up by a very hasty shower and shave.<br />
I was five minutes late getting downtown, something I owed to the plethora of red lights I kept hitting on the way.<br />
We went to Granville Island, home of the freshest food available in the Lower Mainland. We bought all the food that would go into our dinner (after having a quick bite to eat), and returned to our apartment.<br />
I decided that it might be a good idea to put the table, chairs, and barbecue together, since I didn&#8217;t really feel like eating at 21:00. As I began to piece together the table, Allison&#8217;s father sat down next to me and began to help. At first I was about to shoo him away, telling him to spend time with his family, but I quickly realised that I was going to need some help.<br />
The table was a snap, we had it assembled in a few moments. The chairs took a bit longer (and it didn&#8217;t help any that I got two chairs assembled incorrectly), but soon were usable. The big problem was the barbecue. Bad instructions (Step #3 should have been explained before Step #1) led to a longer job. But soon it was perched on the balcony, awaiting a full gas tank to bring it to life.<br />
Having wasted most of an afternoon putting things together, I suggested that we go outside for some air. Allison suggested that we go to Burnaby Lake, which we hadn&#8217;t been to before.<br />
This was considerably harder than it sounds, especially when we didn&#8217;t know exactly where it was. (I know, I know &#8212; how to you not see a lake?) We ended up almost in Coquitlam before we realised that we&#8217;d missed it. So we broke out the map (which was in the trunk, which is why we didn&#8217;t look at it right away) and followed some rudamentary directions.<br />
It turns out that Burnaby Lake is a protected lake &#8212; no-one&#8217;s allowed to swim in it, and the only place you can really get near the lake is at the rowing course that was built a few decades ago. It was the first time that I had seen lilypads in more years than I could possibly remember, let alone count. It&#8217;s about a kilometre long and about 300 metres wide, and ringed completely with marsh. Only the centre of the lake is exposed, which is where the rowing course is.<br />
After that, we decided to hunt down Deer Lake, which is a slightly smaller, but more publicly accessible lake. (It&#8217;s rather interesting that both lakes are within 20 minutes of our apartment.) The area around Deer Lake is a park, and has some very interesting and very expensive buildings surrounding it. I don&#8217;t even want to know what the property prices are.<br />
After visiting Deer Lake, we filled the new propane tank and returned to the apartment to have dinner. This was slightly more difficult than I had originally hoped &#8230; I couldn&#8217;t connect the tank. It seems that a couple of years ago, the Canadian Propane Monopolies decided that they weren&#8217;t making enough money, and changed the attachments for the propane tanks. This, of course, required you to either get a new barbecue, or get a $20 piece of metal that would allow you to attach your tank to your barbecue. I&#8217;m still annoyed that no-one at Home Depot warned me. Argh.<br />
So Mr. Collins and I had to make another run to the nearest Home Depot to pick up an adapter to allow us to cook dinner. By the time we returned, dinner was ready to go on. After dinner, we watched Toy Story, which neither of Allison&#8217;s parents had seen before. I still don&#8217;t know if they really liked it or not.<br />
The next day, we went to Horseshoe Bay to drop off Allison&#8217;s parents at the ferry. We had lunch at Troll&#8217;s, a local legend and location of the best fish and chips I&#8217;ve had. After dropping off Mr. and Mrs. Collins, I convinced Allison that we should go to Whistler. Neither of us had been there before, and it sounded like fun.<br />
A lot of people complain about out-of-province drivers. &#8220;They go so fast!&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re dangerous!&#8221; Let me tell you something &#8212; all the cars tearing up and down those twisting mountain highways were bearing BC license plates. There was the odd out-of-province. And, brother, those were some of the most psychopathic drivers I&#8217;d ever seen. And whoever that moron in the red Dodge Pickup, license BE 5889 &#8212; if I catch you pulling the same shit you were with me, I&#8217;ll have your license revoked permanently!<br />
Anyway, Whister was nice. Creepily nice. And clean. Deathly clean. In fact, it reminded me a lot of Colorado Springs (see [[Road Trip of the Southwest United States, Thunderstorms, Kansas, and Colorado Springs]]). I figured that it was the tourist dollars being put to use keeping the city clean.<br />
It&#8217;s expensive there, though. A two-bedroom apartment sells for at least $200,000. Condos are worse. Especially if you&#8217;re near one of the ski-lifts. The clothes weren&#8217;t cheap either, but then again, this is one of BC&#8217;s biggest tourist destinations. So I guess it goes without saying that the prices will be higher.<br />
Following dinner at the Olde Spaghetti Factory, we headed home to Vancouver. Both of us had to be up the next morning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The fallout from the round of layoffs a week and a half ago came to a rather disappointing end &#8212; one of our lead programmers decided he didn&#8217;t want to work for corporate America, and quit. Just as the game he was working on entered the final development stages. I still can&#8217;t believe that the Powers That Be could not see that coming. I suspect that Rory and Ian (the two driving forces of the company) predicted something like this would happen, but the final decision came from the States. Convenient that they don&#8217;t really have anything to do with this office.<br />
Then Marketting (also located in San Francisco) decided to get into the act. Earlier in the week, a couple of press releases got around about the deal Radical has with ESPN (we&#8217;re making video games for them). One of our investors, who writes a column for BC Technology, decided he&#8217;d start spewing out to the entire planet about the neat things we were doing.<br />
Problem: No-one was supposed to know until today.<br />
So Marketting decided they&#8217;d send around a message that pointed us at a rather heavily made-up internal website that warned employees about talking to the press. (They didn&#8217;t mention a thing about boneheaded investors.) That was mildy degrading. Two days later, we received the hard copies. Four-colour print on expensive-feeling paper. One copy for each person. Nice waste of money, especially so close to layoffs, eh?<br />
It turns out that the flyers were approved and printed before the financial crunch, but I still think that the idea to hand them around was extremely poor. Many people in San Francisco wonder if all of Vancouver hates them. I can safely say we don&#8217;t hate all of them &#8230; just selected people.<br />
Onto different things&#8230;<br />
I got out this weekend. I had originally decided to go out and get a haircut. I haven&#8217;t had a haircut in about three months, so it&#8217;s looking a little scraggly. (I don&#8217;t buy into the ol&#8217; &#8220;haircut every four weeks&#8221; baloney &#8212; that&#8217;s a ploy by the hairdressers of the world to make more money. Same applies for showering daily, which is really only needed unless you&#8217;re dirty or you smell bad.)<br />
Didn&#8217;t make it that far. Allison immediately suggested that we could go to White Rock. Having read a little about it, and not having been there yet, I thought it a good idea. So we hopped in my car, and took off in the general direction of the former resort town.<br />
Finding it was another issue. Although I knew approximately where White Rock was, I had no idea exactly how to get there. Neither did Allison, although she had a much better idea of where it was. We drove across the Knight St. bridge, and drove through Richmond. We eventually found ourselves in Delta, trying to find out way into Surrey. (White Rock is at the south end of Surrey.) Once we entered Surrey, I decided that it would be a good idea to get a roadmap. (Hey, I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who drives aimlessly for hours without asking where I&#8217;m going.)<br />
About 45 minutes or so after leaving home, we found the main drag in White Rock. We drove along for a short distance, and pulled into a parking lot at the side of the road. You could tell we were in a tourist trap &#8212; the parking cost a dollar an hour.<br />
We crossed the railway tracks (Burlington Northern runs a line between White Rock&#8217;s building and beach, a left-over from the heady days of being a resort town, I suspect) and walked towards the wharf, about a kilometre away. (We could have parked closer to the wharf, but we didn&#8217;t know exactly where we were.)<br />
Along the way, we ran into the White Rock, from which the town received its name. It&#8217;s a large boulder of white granite, an erratic left over from the days of the glaciers. Since White Rock was founded, the boulder has received a few coats of white paint, usually from the local graduates.<br />
The wharf (pier, boardwalk, whatever you want to call it) extends into Shemiamoo Bay about a half kilometre or so. At the end are a lot of people fishing, but mostly crabbing (throwing in crab cages and attempting to catch dinner).<br />
We wandered back through the town for a while, before I darted back to retrieve the car. (The parking meter was running low, and Allison&#8217;s new shoes weren&#8217;t exactly co-operating with her feet.) When I returned, I was met with a freight train that rolled along the tracks, (presumably) heading towards Vancouver.<br />
We stopped for a quick snack at an ice cream shop, and took a moment to relax somewhat (we had walked quite a while that morning). Having had our fill of White Rock (it doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; White Rock&#8217;s is quite small), we opted to travel further west along the shore.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Point Roberts. If you follow the western shoreline of Delta south, you pass by Tsawwassen, a major ferry terminal, just before you reach the 49th Parallel, and the end of Canada. But right at that point isn&#8217;t the end of the land &#8212; it actually goes just a bit further south, and into the United States.<br />
In 1854, after many years of arguments between the United States and Britain (who held domain on the western side of the Dominion of Canada), the border was extended across the 49th Parallel until it reached the Georgia Strait, where it dipped slightly to accomodate Fort Victoria, at the south end of Vancouver Island. Originally, the Americans had wanted the border to allow them access right up the coast to Alaska (then-President Polk was elected on the slogan &#8220;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&#8221;), but eventually the Americans and the British agreed on the treaty of 1827, setting the border at the 49th Parallel. Because Point Roberts wasn&#8217;t on the oceans, it became cut off from Canada.<br />
But you&#8217;d never know. Pretty much the entire 4.9 square mile peninsula caters to Canadian interests. There are many beach homes (which sell for as little as US$50,000), and the area is almost completely undeveloped. But most amenities are available, and some of the municipal services (water, hospital) come from neighbouring Canada. The grocery stores take Canadian money with no question. And due to the relative tight security (you have to go through a border crossing when entering and exiting Point Roberts), the crime rate is also very low.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long. Just enough to buy some cheap cheese, and fill up on cheap American gas. We thought we might even stay for dinner, but Point Roberts isn&#8217;t exactly known for its good food. We headed home, but ended up in Richmond to eat at Antonio&#8217;s, a tasty pasta bar.<br />
On Sunday, Allison and I made a quick spin of Metrotown, so we could obtain some free shorts, and peruse the haircutting establishments (none of which I was at all thrilled with). I then pretty much resigned myself to cleaning up my apartment. Having acquired some furniture from IKEA earlier in the week, I was determined to try and clean up my apartment a little.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this is my first crack at a proper Branch entry. Hopefully these will go as well as I hope they do&#8230;<br />
My weekend got off to a bit of a rocky start &#8212; my company laid off 12 people in our Vancouver office. The CEO and CFO of our company (both from our San Francisco office) came up to inform us of the situation. The two driving forces of the company, Ian and Rory (the guys, who IMHO are the men behind the curtain) broke the bad news, and the CEO and CFO put the spin on it.<br />
Now I know why I didn&#8217;t like working for Corporate America &#8212; the spin. I hate spin. I like hard, cold, unsugared facts. I have to give Rory and Ian their credit &#8212; they know their staff well. The CEO on the other hand, well, he needs to be here a little more often to understand us, I guess. All I know is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought his presentation was a little too slick.<br />
On Friday, Allison and I decided we&#8217;d head to Nanaimo for the long weekend. Allison had not been home since our last excursion at Easter, and wanted to go home for a short while. I, too, wanted to go, because it would allow me to get out of the city for a brief period of time. (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says &#8212; a change of scenery is a must from time to time.<br />
Allison picked me up at the office just after 12:00 on Friday afternoon. Our first destination was Granville Island, so we could visit the market. Our plan was to bring over all the goodies needed to have a good west coast barbecue.<br />
Following a brief lunch, we looked around at the various shops. We purchased vegetables (asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), fruit (strawberries), bread (sourdough), salmon steaks wild sockeye), and a bottle of a not-too-dry white wine. The whole shebang came out to around $40. (The salmon and wine accounted for most of the cost.)<br />
By the time we left, we found we would be hard-pressed to get to the ferry at Tsawassen in time. So we opted for the Horseshoe Bay ferry. One minor problem: We weren&#8217;t the only ones with that idea.<br />
By the time we got to Burrard, the street was backed up. It took over 10 minutes to crawl a few measly blocks. Georgia was even worse &#8212; traffic was solid for several blocks. But when we finally cleared the entrance to Stanley Park, the flow began to speed up. However, it was already 14:10, and we had to be at the ferry no later than 14:40 &#8230; if we were lucky enough to find parking.<br />
We had not been able to beat the rush to the long weekend, which was clearly evident by the very long lineup for the ferry. It looked like a three or four sailing wait for some people. Since Allison and I were aiming to be walk-ons, we were able to scoot down into Horseshoe Bay to look for a parking lot. Luck shone on us that day &#8212; we got one of the last spots.<br />
Despite some communication problems, we managed to contact Allison&#8217;s parents. They picked us up at the ferry, and we went to the Collins&#8217; for dinner. Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t started to make dinner yet. It was barbecue night.<br />
The next day, Allison and I thought we&#8217;d do some driving. Mrs. Collins suggested Cathedral Grove, which is a rather famous patch of old-growth forest near the very middle of the Island. Mr. Collins thought Coombs would be a nice stop along the way. Mrs. Collins then started to tell Allison about the new interchanges in the area &#8230; then promptly decided that the four of us should go on the trip. I had no objections.<br />
We stopped along the way at Rathtrevor beach, so I could see what a good tidal beach looked like. I don&#8217;t know how far out that beach went, but it looked like a half-kilometre. At high tide, the beach would completely vanish. All I could think was that the beach would be immense fun in the summer.<br />
We proceeded north to Parksville, where we turned onto the Port Alberni Highway, and headed west. Not too far from Parksville, we entered Coombs, a little town in the Island interior. Coombs probably used to be nothing more than a mining or logging town. Today it has a thriving little tourist business, formed around the Coombs market. What&#8217;s so special about the market? It&#8217;s not every day you see a sod roof with real goats parading about.<br />
Soon we entered Cathedral Grove. It&#8217;s a provincial park that was created from land donated by H.R. MacMillian, a forester who founded HR MacMillian (part of MacMillian-Blodel industries, if I&#8217;m not mistaken). Yes, Her-mac (as one call it) is a logging company. Sounds a little weird for a founder of a company that has come under a lot of fire for logging old growth-trees to donate a small forest of old-growth trees for parkland, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, Mr. MacMillan was apparently a nice guy, and wanted the future to know what the past looked like. Public outcry also forwarded the cause.<br />
Cathedral Grove is aptly named &#8212; I have never in my life seen trees so large. But even trees so large are not immune to the environment. On Jan. 1, 1997, there was a tremendous windstorm that tore through the grove. It knocked over several trees and thousands of branches. Several parts of the forest floor were complete littered with timber. But none of it was cleaned out &#8212; the park is to remain almost completely untouched.<br />
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Coombs, to shop at the market, and look around. It&#8217;s a nice little market &#8230; with a few hundred people packed in. But it&#8217;s worth the drive &#8230; at least, I thought it was worth the drive.<br />
We had a late lunch in the restaurant, and wandered through the multitude of wares in the market. (Oddly enough, most of the wares were Mexican &#8230; a little strange, IMHO, considering the Native influences in BC.) I purchased two very large Mexican hand-woven blankets (which are really warm). Allison bought a handful of paper mache vegetables for decoration.<br />
Returning home, we sat down to the task of making dinner. But even then, we didn&#8217;t eat until 20:00 or so. I offered to try and fix Mrs. Collins&#8217; email problems on her computer. She&#8217;d been having problems with the addressbook, and having multiple copies of Netscape floating around.<br />
The next day we rose early to go see the Victoria Day Parade. The Victoria Day Parade is a big thing out here. Few places in Ontario (only Ottawa comes to mind, and apparently Orillia also carries on the tradition) have a formal parade. In Ontario, the Victoria Day Weekend is more commonly known as the &#8220;May Two-Four&#8221; (the weekend was traditionally around May 24th, and a case of 24 beers is known as a &#8220;two-four&#8221;). It&#8217;s essentially the start of the cottage season in Ontario.<br />
We arrived downtown at about 10:40, expecting the parade to start at 11:00 (which was what we were led to believe). However, we noticed that there were still a lot of cars on the parade route, not all the reviewing stands had been completed, and we were the only people standing around. Mr. Collins soon found out that we had come too early &#8212; the parade didn&#8217;t start until 13:00.<br />
So we went wandering down on the waterfront. It was a nice day, albeit a little chilly from the wind. The weekend had brought a small amusement park to the waterfront (where just attractions appear during festive weekends). We had a batch of less-than-satisfactory french fries (they left a horrible taste in my mouth, and neither Allison or I were feeling too good as a result).<br />
At about 12:45, we headed back to the road to see the parade. When we arrived, the crowds that I had been expecting had appeared. Just after 13:00, the first sign of the parade went by &#8212; a fire truck. I had forgotten what community parades were like. It had been so long since my last one.<br />
I found out after the weekend that one of my co-workers, Greg Mayer, had been on the Hungarian Cultural float (it won for best Cultural Presentation, and Best Presentation Overall). We had somehow managed not to see each other.<br />
We had to hurry back to the Collins&#8217; to go to a family barbecue with Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents. We were sidetracked temporarily at home. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and had to lie down for a while before continuing out again.<br />
The barbecue was great &#8212; Mrs. Collins had made a potato salad that was exactly like the one my mother makes. It was like being at home. We ate until there was no food left to eat, and then ate some more. Dessert was a berry mix on a sponge cake, with whipped cream. Very tasty. Mostly considering that until this weekend, I didn&#8217;t eat berries. Things just keep changing&#8230;<br />
After dinner, we went inside where Allison and I watched the last episode of Murphy Brown. It was sad to see such a good show go, but it was a good last episode. Between Murphy Brown and the X-Files (which came on later), we went into the kitchen to make &#8220;stamps&#8221;. These were pieces of paper that you stamped with ink, and then sprinkled a special glitter overtop. Using a heater, you melted the glitter to make the stamp. It was fun. I won a prize.<br />
Then the final episode of the X-Files came on. Well, the final one that was filmed in Vancouver, anyway. (For we Canucks, it might as well be the final one.) I felt bad because I pretty much had the entire family in the living room watching a show that really didn&#8217;t seem to appeal to anyone. It was only a plot-builder for the movie being released this summer.<br />
Following the movie, the Collins and I made a hasty retreat back to the waterfront to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, we were late in arriving, and the fireworks had already started. As a result, we didn&#8217;t get out of the car. On the bright side though, we managed to be the first car out of there, and missed all the traffic. I felt bad again for making everyone miss the start of the fireworks.<br />
I tried to amend for my selfishness by buying coffee (and hot chocolate) and donuts (and muffins) for the Collins on our way back home.<br />
The next day, the weather couldn&#8217;t make up its mind. It was either rainy or somewhat sunny &#8212; there was no comfortable medium. We left late in the afternoon, catching the 16:30 ferry from Departure Bay. For those of you who know the ferry schedule, yes, that is not a standard ferry time. Extra ferries were running to cope with the traffic.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entry is long overdue &#8212; I should have issued this sometime last week. But it&#8217;s been one of those weeks where I&#8217;ve barely had time to check my email, let alone write any.<br />
It all started a few weeks ago, when I heard through the grapevine that my mother and my mother&#8217;s mother (to whom all the young&#8217;uns on this side of the family affectionately refer to as &#8220;Nana&#8221;) were going to be visiting my aunt and uncle in Calgary. This was a particularly good thing for me &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen my mother in a couple of months, I hadn&#8217;t seen Nana since early September, I hadn&#8217;t seen Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike (not to mention my hyper little cousin Jennifer) since August, nor had I seen Pam since that time (she also lives in Calgary, but is the daughter of another part of the family), and I hadn&#8217;t seen Stuart or Therese since Christmas.<br />
No, Stuart and Therese aren&#8217;t a part of my biological family. They are however, two of my closest friends in the world &#8212; and are for all intents and purposes, my extended family. Having to shift from seeing them nearly everyday, to seeing them once every few months isn&#8217;t easy. And I&#8217;d been wanting to see them for quite a while, especially since they had bought two new siamese kittens.<br />
So I sat down and looked at the cost of airfare. Allison looked at the cheapest ways out there &#8212; by car, and by bus. She wanted to come (and I wanted her to come), but she didn&#8217;t have the money to pay for the $200 airfare. (We&#8217;d missed the seat sale requirements by one lousy day.)<br />
For a while, it looked like Allison wouldn&#8217;t be able to go. And I really wasn&#8217;t keen on going without her. But then luck shined upon the both of us &#8230; she &#8220;found&#8221; $800 in her bank accounts. As her father put it: &#8220;Only Allison could find $800.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know how she did it, but at that point, I didn&#8217;t care to find out.<br />
To ease our travelling (and get the cheapest airfare possible), we opted to leave early on Friday the 17th. Allison got the day off, and I just didn&#8217;t bother to go in (my office has such flexible time that I can decide not to come in one day, just so long as I make the time up at some point).<br />
We drove down to Richmond (where YVR &#8212; the Vancouver Airport &#8212; sprawls over Sea Island), and hunted for a cheap place to park Allison&#8217;s car. We found a lot at the Comfort Inn that charged only $3 a day. We had considered taking the bus, but we were coming back at 08:20 on the Monday, and Allison needed a quick (and inexpensive) way to work.<br />
We were flying WestJet, a small airline that offers really cheap airfare between cities in the west (they have extended as far as Winnipeg, but whether they&#8217;ll go any further is anyone&#8217;s guess). We checked in, got our tickets (WestJet doesn&#8217;t issue &#8220;real&#8221; tickets, only boarding passes, which have to be picked up the day of the flight), and went to have breakfast. (WestJet doesn&#8217;t offer meals on their flights, and we were starving.)<br />
The flight was quite nice &#8212; we flew in an arc over northern Washington State, recieving a wonderful view of area around Mount Baker, and we could see as far as Mount Ranier.<br />
We arrived in Calgary around 11:20. As we touched down, Allison noted that it was &#8220;rather flat&#8221;. The Calgary-bashing had started. We weaved our way through the terminal to the baggage claim, so I could get my backpack. While we waited, I inquired about taking a bus downtown.<br />
We had to meet my cousin Pam at her office. She had graciously offered us the use of her sofa-bed and even her car (which she barely used) during our stay in Calgary. I checked in with her, and arranged for a time.<br />
We hopped a bus, which took us down to the Whitehorn C-Train station. (The C-Train is Calgary&#8217;s LRT system, and is part-and-parcel of their transit system.) We took the train downtown to the approximate intersection where we found find Pam&#8217;s office building.<br />
My only gripe about Calgary is that the road systems are WAY too confusing. Downtown, everything is numbered &#8212; streets and avenues. If someone gives you the information backwards by accident, you could end up blocks away. To further complicate issues, downtown is also where the city is split up into quadrants &#8212; so the roads restart their numbering four times. Fortunately, we were always in the southern quadrants while looking for Pam.<br />
The Petro-Canada tower wasn&#8217;t hard to find, and surprisingly enough, neither was Pam &#8212; we ran into her after had a bite to eat for lunch. At first I didn&#8217;t recognise her &#8212; she seemed to have lost a little weight from the last time I saw her. (Then again, she had been wearing a thick sweater that time.)<br />
She gave us instructions, the keys to her apartment and her car, and the code to get into her building. We were off again, to find her illusive apartment. Her instructions weren&#8217;t exactly correct, we found ourselves dumped at a parking lot (and yes, we had followed those instructions correctly). A shift of two blocks east corrected that problem).<br />
Our first order of business was to see the family. Pam had warned us that they were out, and wouldn&#8217;t be back until 15:30 that afternoon. So we thought we&#8217;d take our time and look around a little. We decided to go for a drive in Pam&#8217;s car.<br />
In general, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of most Japanese cars &#8212; I don&#8217;t fit in them very well. (The problems with being a large person.) I had complained a few times about Allison&#8217;s Toyota Corolla, because it was small (for me &#8212; Allison kept saying I should make a concerted effort to be smaller). Pam&#8217;s Nissan Micra made me feel claustrophobic.<br />
The sun in the Prairies is bright. I had forgotten how bright &#8212; Vancouver&#8217;s sun is muted by the cloud cover. The both of us ended up buying sunglasses to counter the painful squinting.<br />
We arrived at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house a little after 15:30 (after arriving early, finding no-one home, and then going off to purchase the aforementioned sunglasses). My aunt Brenda answered the door, motioned us to be quiet, and pointed at the kitchen. I boldly walked into the kitchen, plunked my bags down, and loudly announced &#8220;Hello&#8221;.<br />
Oh &#8230; did I mention that neither my mother or Nana knew that I was coming?<br />
My mother looked up at me, and there was an instant look of recognition in her face &#8230; quickly followed by the look that appears as the visual thought of something that is out of place. Surprise followed soon after. Nana, on the other hand, seemed completely overwhelmed by the seemingly unending surprises.<br />
Allison and I sat down and talked with my relatives for a while, during which various family members came and went. Eventually, it was our turn to leave. Our family night was planned for the following night, and I really wanted to see Stuart and Therese.<br />
We spent a little time at Therese and Stuart&#8217;s (trying mostly to get their two new kittens to come out from under the bed long enough so I could see them) before we decided to go out to dinner.<br />
Stuart suggested that we try Montana&#8217;s, a chain of steakhouses that had finally migrated to Calgary. Therese referred to it as &#8220;Stuart and Geoff food&#8221;, which I have to admit, I took some offense to. My diet has changed quite significantly since I arrived in Vancouver, and I tend not to eat all the things I used to.<br />
At any rate, the place was packed, and we ended up at Joey Tomatoes not too far away. It was a pretty decent meal all around. And it gave us a good time to sit and talk and visit.<br />
Afterwards, we went back to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s, where we continued to talk a while longer. Well, most of us talked a while longer. Therese kept dropping off. She works a lot at school, and it takes a lot out of her. One day, she&#8217;ll be able to stay up after midnight&#8230;<br />
When Allison and I arrived home that night, we were ultra-careful not to wake up Pam. The sofa-bed was already set up, and it didn&#8217;t take us long to go to sleep.<br />
The next day, Allison and I decided that we would visit Banff. Although we had both been there before (not at the same time), we wanted to visit again. In both cases, we had only a short time to look around, and Banff is one of those places you really need to see carefully.<br />
The trip out was uneventful &#8230; except we were wondering whether Pam&#8217;s Micra would make it intact. It was a peppy little car &#8230; going downhill. The hour-and-a-half drive was a little more than the car could take.<br />
But it was worth the drive. Banff was in full bloom (snow included), and was quite the sight to see. The tourists were mostly gone (I guess it wasn&#8217;t their time of the year anymore) &#8230; except for the throngs of people waiting outside of the Roots. We guessed that someone like Elvis Stojko or Ross Rebigilati was inside.<br />
We visited the Hot Springs (the wrong ones, so it turned out &#8212; the original hot springs were in a different location), the Banff Springs Hotel (I have to stay there at least one night in my life), and drove around in the town. Finally, we headed back to Calgary for dinner with the family.<br />
The next day, on a suggestion from my family, we visited Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, an historical site in the southern portion of Alberta. In use for nearly 5,700 years, the buffalo jump was a cliff that natives used to kill large groups of buffalo.<br />
The museum is built into the side of the cliff, not too far from the location of the actual buffalo jump. Great care was taken in building the site, such that it wouldn&#8217;t affect the any of the archeological remains in the area. The design, combined with the unbelievable quality of the education, garnered the museum the honour of being a UNESCO site. It was worth the five hour round-trip.<br />
We asked Stuart to come along with us, mostly because it would get him out of the apartment he shared with Therese. (Therese had to mark 40 20-page essays, and having Stuart around wasn&#8217;t exactly helpful.) Furthermore, I wanted to see as much of my friends as possible.<br />
The next morning, we had to catch our flight back to Vancouver. By that point, we had pretty much come to the conclusion that we could not live in Calgary. Allison had written off Calgary within a few moments of arriving (her first comment was: &#8220;It&#8217;s flat!&#8221;), but it didn&#8217;t take too long for me to realise that Calgary was no longer for me either.<br />
Having arrived in Calgary from Ontario, I found it very nice. But after living in Vancouver for nearly four months, I found Calgary&#8217;s appeal much lessened. I suspect that I shall have a hard time finding another place I love as much.<br />
And if you&#8217;re wondering just how I came to this conclusion, when I arrived back in Vancouver, not only did I feel more relaxed, but I felt like I was home. Not just back where I lived, but where I felt I should live.<br />
We then had the nasty task of attempting to find Allison&#8217;s car. We couldn&#8217;t remember the name of the company we had left it with. I knew it was a set of initials, but I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. We eventually remembered that the lot was at the Comfort Inn. It seemed that DPS, the people we left the car with, were known as Diamond Parking Services &#8230; everywhere except on their signs.<br />
On Sunday (the 28th), we delivered Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, to the Hand of Fate &#8212; and the airport. Jane was moving to Europe. She had made the decision that she would live in Britain for a while &#8230; about a year.<br />
And she was not too excited about it either. Well, she was and she wasn&#8217;t. Most importantly, she was terrified. This was the first time she had been away from home. Mrs. Collins was almost as worried as Jane.<br />
I was envious. She was going somewhere I hadn&#8217;t been. I want to go to Europe. I&#8217;ve never been, and there&#8217;s so much to see. Perhaps one day I will go. Allison even hinted that we could visit with Jane.<br />
I wish her well, and hope that she has the time of her life. She will likely be a very different person when I meet her next. I only hope that life doesn&#8217;t jade her.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting few days. This weekend, as you already know, was Easter. This was the first time I was not in Ontario for Easter. I had been away from home before &#8212; usually on co-op terms (although university often did its fair share), but this was the first time that I was threatened with complete isolation from all friends and family.<br />
But I was saved by the graciousness of the Collins. They invited me to spend the Easter holidays with them. I, of course, accepted. I wasn&#8217;t interested in sitting in my lonely apartment all weekend.<br />
Allison and I left on Friday moring, catching the 12:30 ferry to Nanaimo. We went downtown to catch the 257 Horseshoe Bay Express. We didn&#8217;t want to take the car over &#8212; BC Ferries is in my opinion (and probably others) prohibitively expensive.<br />
We took the bus from the start of its route. This was Allison&#8217;s idea &#8212; and a very good one. When we got to the stop at the Bay on West Georgia, there were approximately a hundred people waiting. Our bus was full in a matter of moments.<br />
While we waited for people to board, someone knocked on the window. It was Jane, Allison&#8217;s sister. She was returning from the Arts Council Festival (or something like that), featuring Holly MacNarland and Great Big Sea. She was heading home for work. However, she would not be able get on our bus. BC Transit, however, is not for a lack of intelligence. They had another bus following ours, which picked up the remainder of the waiting passengers.<br />
The ferry traffic was heavy. Lots of cars, and lots of people. We made the sailing (so did Jane and her friend, Renata), which was 15 minutes late in leaving. During the crossing, we called Allison&#8217;s parents to inform them that there would be four of us, not just two. (This was important because we were to be picked up &#8230; and no matter how hard you try, you can&#8217;t pack six people into a Honda Civic.)<br />
That night was a quiet dinner with Allison, her parents, and her brother, Randy, when he arrived home from work. It was a roast of beef that came without yorkshire pudding or cheese sauce (for the broccoli), a result of Allison&#8217;s aunt Vicky appearing and staying too long. (Allison&#8217;s mom, who is Vicky&#8217;s sister, could not break away to continue with dinner.)<br />
Afterwards, we played Scrabble. It was a rather interesting game, mostly because the two English majors (Allison and myself) could not defeat Allison&#8217;s father. I could not remember the last time I had played, if ever.<br />
The next day, Allison took me around Nanaimo, showing me some of the different little townships that made up the whole city (and let me tell you &#8212; Nanaimo is a huge city). We went down to the waterfront (which apparently wasn&#8217;t a waterfront until a few decades ago &#8212; most of it was filled in), where the last bastion of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company remains presevered.<br />
We walked along the concrete and steel railed wharf, passing by such interesting things as the Javawocky, a little cafe. Most of the boats in the harbour (that we could see) were fishing trawlers. I didn&#8217;t know if there were in harbour because of the holiday, or were idled due to the drop in the fishing industry. Most looked in good condition, so I can only assume it was the holiday.<br />
We continued down to an artificial lagoon. which the city had built to enhance the waterfront. It created a small, sheltered beach, and calm water that remained even when the tide was low. Stray logs from the log booms that are towed through Georgia Strait had washed to the beach &#8230; or had been dragged there for character. On the other side of the lagoon was a large children&#8217;s playground, perhaps the most exciting looking one I&#8217;d ever seen. I wished I was 10 again.<br />
Not far away was a bronze statue of an ex-mayor who was &#8220;affectionately&#8221; known as &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. He was the man who invented the idea of the Bathtub Races (you only way you could *not* have heard about the Nanaimo Bathtub Race is if you&#8217;ve been living in a dark room for the past few decades). He dressed as a pirate (especially during said races), which is where he obtained the name &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. However. as a mayor, he did some pretty questionable (and in a few cases, down-right unethical) things, so the name had more than one connotation.<br />
That night, we had a full turkey dinner (again, with a delayed Randy) with Grandma Collins, a wonderful woman who was an utter delight to have conversation with. She certainly didn&#8217;t strike me as the &#8220;typical&#8221; little old lady. She was more concerned with having fun.<br />
After dinner, Allison and I went out with Kelly, an old friend of Allison&#8217;s whom she hadn&#8217;t seen in over four years, and went to a pub downtown (nearly everything else closes down early in Nanaimo &#8230; even coffee shops) for a few drinks. None of us had anything alcoholic, but we were there for a couple of hours.<br />
The next morning was the day of the Easter Egg hunts. I can&#8217;t honestly remember the last time that the Easter Bunny visited my sister and I, but I can guess at it being many, many years. Well, it seems that the Easter Bunny is alive and well in Nanaimo &#8230; and he made many a visit this morning.<br />
First off was in the Collins household. It seems that there is a tradition, where the two resident rabbits (Mr. and Mrs. Collins) hide things in the kitchen. I was an unwitting inductee. Amongst various chocolates, I also received a t-shirt. I was extremely surprised (not expecting anything of the sort), and most thankful.<br />
Then it was off to Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents (less than a five minute drive) for lunch. That was, lunch after the Easter Egg hunt. (Yes, another one.) This time, the hunt was more elaborate. Everyone (except Mr. and Mrs. Vaillette &#8212; I apologise if the spelling is incorrect) had a plastic egg hidden somewhere around the tree. Inside the egg was a rhyme, which was our clue to the location of our prize (hidden by Brenna, one of Allison&#8217;s cousins).<br />
Needless to say, I think I was terribly well treated for an outsider. But you won&#8217;t hear me complaining!<br />
Well, there&#8217;s not much more at this point &#8230; more will come later on as I continue. But life resumes tomorrow &#8212; back to work, back to playing games.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Greetings from Lotus Land! (I still have no idea why people call it that &#8212; nowadays you could reefer to it as Grass Land &#8230; yes, I spelled &#8220;reefer&#8221; on purpose.)<br />
Undoubtedly you&#8217;ve all heard the trials and tribulations of Ross Rebagliati (sp?), the Canadian Snowboarding gold medalist. The whole thing wasn&#8217;t really played up too much around here, other than we thought that it was a really dumb thing to get worked up about. It all came down to punctuation for us:<br />
Rest of the World: They smoke marijuana in Whistler?<br />
British Columbia: They smoke marijuana in Whistler.<br />
(It&#8217;s not a question, it&#8217;s a fact. You could also have written our response a little more succinctly: &#8220;DUH!&#8221;)<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that jokes weren&#8217;t flying about &#8212; one had Ross as the new spokesperson for Hostess. (Y&#8217;know &#8212; &#8220;when you got the munchies&#8230;&#8221;)<br />
Life wound up at Prologic Corp. right on schedule, and I left on Friday without a hitch. And then it was off for the weekend.<br />
Allison and I made plans to spend Valentine&#8217;s day in Victoria. But first, we had to get to the island. At roughly 17:15, we departed the office, jumped in Allison&#8217;s car, and headed to Horseshoe Bay, which is roughly north-west of Vancouver. Although the ferry port at Tswassen (which is pronounced &#8220;swaa-sen&#8221; or &#8220;te-waa-sen&#8221;, depending on who you ask) was closer, there was a two sailing wait (there were *that* many cars waiting to leave &#8212; each ferry takes between 150 and 200 cars, and the sailings are at most once an hour), and we wanted to be in Nanaimo before 22:00, if possible.<br />
We arrived at Horseshoe Bay about 18:15 or so (yes, it took that long to get there). We purchased a ticket for the next sailing, which was 19:00. Unlike Tswassen, we wouldn&#8217;t have to wait.<br />
This was a good thing. The ferry takes a minimum of an hour and a half to get to the other side. We arrived in Nanaimo around 20:45 (counting the delays, and the loading/unloading time), and we promptly headed for Fast Eddies, a local favourite restaurant (best blackened chicken I&#8217;ve had outside of New Orleans!). We wanted to have dinner before descending on Allison&#8217;s parents.<br />
When arrived at the Collins family estate, Allison expressed her concern that she might not be able to sneak me inside &#8212; all the doors were locked. Why did she want to sneak me inside &#8212; several of her relatives were there. I was worried enough about meeting her parents, let alone a portion of her family tree (albeit a small portion &#8212; apparently Allison&#8217;s family tree is quite extensive).<br />
The introductions went quite well (I wasn&#8217;t immediately thrown out of the house, nor was I asked a great deal of embarrasing questions). Of course, I figured a way out of receiving the Evil Eyes &#8212; I brought a box of chocolates for Allison&#8217;s parents. When in doubt, go for the brownie points!<br />
(I&#8217;ve since found out that I&#8217;ve passed the &#8220;first test&#8221;. I&#8217;m somewhat apprehensive about the &#8220;second test&#8221;.)<br />
The conversation was not centred around me (thankfully), but it allowed me to get my foot in once in a while (I know families where you have to shout to be heard). But the family slowly weeded itself down until it was just Mr. and Mrs. Collins, Allison, and myself. Her sister Jane, who bears a striking resemblance to Kirsten Dunst (who appeared in such movies as Interview with the Vampire and Wag the Dog) showed up later, and promptly started downing a litre of cold pre-made cappaccino. Allison&#8217;s brother Randy appeared about a half hour afterwards.<br />
The next day we drove down the Island Highway (aka Canada Route 1, aka the Trans Canada Highway) to Victoria. Some parts of that trip were like travelling through a fairy tale &#8212; huge trees coated with deep green moss, huge cliffs dripping with lush vegetation &#8212; a rainforest without monkeys or macaus.<br />
Victoria was decidedly nicer than Nanaimo &#8212; namely, it wasn&#8217;t raining. We checked into the James Bay Inn (Victoria has a big thing about James Bay, for some strange reason), which was a block from the house Emily Carr was born in. We then decided to walk around Victoria.<br />
Victoria is a beautiful city &#8212; it reminds me very much of more European cities &#8212; Helsinki, most notably. I think it&#8217;s one of the smallest capitals in Canada &#8212; certainly the smallest west of Quebec (and south of the northern Territories). It&#8217;s also very relaxed. VERY relaxed. No-one seems in a rush (of course, all the horse-drawn carriages might attribute to that).<br />
We visited the Royal BC Museum (not as extensive as the ROM, but I think the collection of Native artifacts cannot be paralleled &#8212; except maybe by the Museum of Anthropology at UBC), which took us a couple of hours. Then we wandered over to a place called &#8220;Undersea World&#8221; (or some similarly cheesy name). It&#8217;s a building set into the harbour, with a few walls around the outside in the water. It&#8217;s an aquarium essentially, but the water&#8217;s right out of the bay (there are grates that open right into the surrounding water). The admission included a 15 minute scuba show where a diver showed off some of the various fauna of the deep.<br />
The most surprising thing I saw in that show was the conditioning of the fish &#8212; not the water conditioning, I mean the mental conditioning! I had always assumed (rather naively, so it seems) that the brain stems of fish were capable of only providing survival instincts &#8212; that fish couldn&#8217;t really &#8220;learn&#8221; things. The diver proved me very wrong. He pulled out a triangle (the kind you see in old westerns when Cookie calls the cowboys for dinner) and rang it. All the fish suddenly turned and gravitated towards him. Mondo creepy. Pavlov would be proud.<br />
We proceeded along the roads to see what there was to see, which included Chinatown, and Fan Tan Alley &#8212; the narrowest road in Canada. It&#8217;s about a metre wide. There are actual addresses (stores, specifically), so it&#8217;s a designated (complete with postal code) road. Parts of &#8220;Bird on a Wire&#8221; (filmed in 1990, starring Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn) were filmed in Vancouver and Victoria, including Fan Tan Alley.<br />
We had a very filling meal at a local Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (Note: Victoria&#8217;s Chinatown is less than a block, and is mostly for tourists). The service was lousy, but the food was great! The meal ended with the traditional fortune cookies. I had to laugh when I read my fortune: &#8220;Luck is coming your way.&#8221; (This is funny when you remember to read it the way you&#8217;re supposed to read fortunes.)<br />
The next morning (this morning), we toured around the city, where I made an effort to take a picture of the beginning of the Trans Canada Highway (yes kiddies, the TCH *starts* in Victoria &#8212; how&#8217;s that for trivia? Fool your friends!) We then wound our way to Craigdarroch Castle, built by millionaire coal baron (and all-round nasty guy) Robert Dunsmuir. Rumour has it that he blew up a mine full of workers (seven died) because of complains about the quality of life, the lack of wages, and so forth. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be too much sentiment for the guy.<br />
Finally, we headed back to Vancouver, via the Schwartz Bay ferry terminal. We barely missed making the ferry, and had to wait an hour until the next sailing. I will say one thing for the ferries in BC &#8212; they&#8217;re usually pretty nice, and the trip from Schwartz Bay to Tswassen is a beautiful one! I highly recommend it to anyone making the trip! (Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay is mostly in open water, but gives you a great view of the mountains on a clear day).<br />
Anyhoo, this log is plently long enough for now. I now leave you to your regular activities&#8230;<br />
By the way, for those of you who don&#8217;t know the &#8220;real&#8221; way you&#8217;re supposed to read a fortune, you add &#8220;in bed&#8221; at the end. Believe it or not, most fortunes make more sense that way&#8230;</p>
