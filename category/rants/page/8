		<p><em>Sigh.</em><br />
Just when I thought <a href="http://www.decloak.com/Dev/CSSTables/CSS_Tables_01.aspx">this topic was in the past</a>, to be revisited in the same manner as when historians look at how the Black Plague ravaged Europe. But no, it&#8217;s back. I&#8217;ve had to don my somewhat dusty Web Practice Lead hat at Critical Mass to once again defend the faith from tyranny and the inequities of evil men. (Sorry, sudden <em>Pulp Fiction</em> flashback.) That should read to defend against ignorance. But I digress&#8230;<br />
There has been a slight push in the industry over the last few months to return to using tables for web page layouts, rather than the industry standard CSS presentation. Keeping our finger on the pulse of the industry, many of us at Critical Mass have seen the arguments. Some even begin to question our own direction.<br />
This is a good thing, by the way. I want those questions. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> once said, the most dangerous phrase in the language is: &#8220;We&#8217;ve always done it this way.&#8221; Bring the arguments. Bring the discussion. Just come armed and educated.<br />
The movement back to tables is an uneducated position. Despite all the arguments for the movement, the one thing it seems to be ignoring is why the W3C standards exist. They&#8217;re not there because a few people thought it was a good idea. They&#8217;re there because a group of people far more educated than I spent the time to figure out what the best method would be.<br />
Yes, CSS is complicated. I will completely agree that in many ways, CSS is far too cumbersome for most developers. I will be among the first to stand up and say that support is not complete and correct. I&#8217;ll gladly point fingers at Microsoft&#8217;s regular aberrant behaviour. CSS is not perfect, and anyone who uses it with any depth will come to realize that there are issues with CSS&#8217;s specification (never mind the often haphazard way the browsers implement the specification).<br />
BUT<br />
Critical Mass does not represent most developers. We have gone beyond what most developers contend with. Our interfaces are richer and more engaging than the majority of designs out there. We deal with clients who expect results better than middle-of-the-road, and that&#8217;s what will drive us to use the right technology for the right reasons.<br />
As strange as it sounds, we work towards segregation: separation of content, presentation, functionality, and structure. This isn&#8217;t just the W3C standard &#8212; this is common sense. Anyone striving to do proper development, in <em>any</em> language, should be doing this. If you tie the structure to presentation, you&#8217;re going to have a fun time making edits when that presentation changes. I&#8217;ve seen this happen hundreds of times before. Veterans in this industry can tell you horror stories of having to change the structure of a website across a thousand files, a tedious task that took weeks. Yes, this can be automated, but the connection is the point &#8212; it should <strong>never</strong> occur.<br />
In this article, they split CSS into CSS and CSS-P. This is an interesting, albeit incorrect direction. Critical Mass (as well as most decent developers) adhere to CSS 2.1, which doesn&#8217;t break down into two parts. It&#8217;s <strong>one</strong> standard that happens to cover the appearance of fonts and colours, and handle the layout of a page. And that&#8217;s what people need to understand.<br />
This requires an understanding of CSS beyond how to use CSS for fonts. From a hiring perspective, we do require that all new hires have an understanding of CSS. While we do not require skills along the lines of Jason Santa Maria, Dave Shea, or Dan Cederholm, although it&#8217;s very cool when someone comes in the door who writes great CSS. We do want to see people laying out pages in CSS, even if it&#8217;s rudimentary and potentially awkward. Only with that understanding can people learn.<br />
When people cry that &#8220;tables are the only way to go&#8221; for websites, they have given up on the standards and all the benefits that come along with them. They have opted to cut themselves short on skills and knowledge and allow the site to suffer long-term. I cannot accept that anyone would willingly throw in the towel to lose out on the flexibility of using CSS over the rigidity of tables.<br />
Arguments such as speed, ROI, tables already being in databases, and standards that are too heavy are grossly uninformed. Speed is pointless because any sufficiently complicated design will necessarily have a sufficiently complicated table &#8212; and that&#8217;s easily larger than using CSS because you have to download the table on every single page. CSS downloads once. ROI is self-defeating because most people only look at the development phase and neglect the far more costly maintenance phase. Well-developed CSS will always allow for faster (hence, cheaper) maintenance. Yes, tables are in a database &#8230; and if that&#8217;s your argument, you&#8217;ve completely misunderstood the need to separate systems. And that&#8217;s not a discussion I&#8217;m getting into now.<br />
It&#8217;s the flexibility that we want. CSS can change quickly (assuming you&#8217;ve architected your CSS appropriately) and the same structure can be reformatted with many CSS files. I challenge anyone to show me how to do CSS Zen Garden in tables. And remember, any sufficiently powerful tool is by its own nature more complicated &#8212; simple isn&#8217;t always better.<br />
All of that said, I do have a concession&#8230;<br />
Despite the need to follow standards (knowing why we use them), there is an overriding condition that we must be aware of at all times: We have to follow budgets. And if something is too difficult to do in CSS, we will build it with tables.<br />
Though I will immediately point out (should this condition arise) that if you are going to tables because it won&#8217;t work with CSS, that I would question the reasons why. If it&#8217;s an infamiliarity with the technology, then more practice might be required. Or that the CSS is already too complex, and there&#8217;s a cascade problem. Specificity is important, and the key is to know when to use global settings and when to use specific references.<br />
And of course, we should ALWAYS use tables for tabular data. But you already know that.<br />
So why is this coming up? Why is there the movement back? In a word: AJAX (oh, how I hate that acronym). The last time we had a major buzzword in the Web Development field, it was DHTML. It&#8217;s equally as annoying as AJAX because it caused everyone to think a new technology existed. (In both cases, it&#8217;s just promoting something that already exists in a novel way.) The buzz has had a positive spin, forcing a lot of previously less-skilled developers to need to learn the standards to implement AJAX correctly. The speed at which people have had to learn is a concern, and those having trouble with CSS are running back to tables.<br />
To those people: slow down. Don&#8217;t panic. The solution is there, you just need to spend some time and play a bit with CSS. Maybe you need to do it at home. If you think CSS isn&#8217;t worth the time and effort, you really need to think about how you&#8217;re approaching your project. I know from my own experience that tables are a dead-end. And if you talk to the best developers in the field, tables are <em>only</em> good for presenting tabular data. Long live CSS.</p>

		<p>I was having a discussion with Doug down in the Bistro this morning, and I came to a rather interesting realization: Calgary Transit sucks.<br />
Let&#8217;s have a realistic view, here. Calgary is the third or fourth largest city in Canada. We&#8217;re over a million people (we recently had our one millionth baby, but I suspect we&#8217;re actually well over that number in population). We have a massive city by area because Calgary hasn&#8217;t quite figured out that we should be building up, not out.<br />

		<p>When did society become responsible for the stupidity of individuals?<br />
Over the last few years, there&#8217;s been a disturbing trend where corporations (and governments, through the courts) have had to start protecting the stupid. Not the mentally disabled &#8212; the stupid. Seemingly ordinary people that, on the surface, you&#8217;d probably never suspect of being a moron. And yet, these people are the ones who end up affecting the rest of us because they feel they were specifically picked upon and justified in their retribution.<br />
What am I referring to? Cold coffee. Quiet iPods. Notices of the blatantly obvious.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The definition of &#8220;patent&#8221;, courtesy of the <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/index.html#patent">US Patent and Trademark Office</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor, issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Generally, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States or, in special cases, from the date an earlier related application was filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees. U.S. patent grants are effective only within the United States, U.S. territories, and U.S. possessions. Under certain circumstances, patent term extensions or adjustments may be available.<br />
The right conferred by the patent grant is, in the language of the statute and of the grant itself, &#8220;the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling&#8221; the invention in the United States or &#8220;importing&#8221; the invention into the United States. What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import, but the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, selling or importing the invention. Once a patent is issued, the patentee must enforce the patent without aid of the USPTO.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there&#8217;s quite a bit more to that definition, but this is as good a place as any to start. Mostly because this is the key point at which the problems seem to start: &#8220;the right to exclude others from [doing anything with] the invention&#8221;. Basically, suing people to ensure that you either get royalties or stop them from doing anything with the invention in question.<br />
And more importantly it is the term &#8220;invention&#8221; that I have issue with.<br />
Lately, it seems that there are a number of companies quite content with registering patents for &#8220;inventions&#8221; that are little more than an extension of logical progression &#8212; something that was bound to come in just a matter of time. But due to the way that American Capitalism works, there is money to be made &#8230; even if you don&#8217;t have to lift a finger to get it.<br />
A few people were applauding the USPTO&#8217;s decision to grant a patent on the techniques used to <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=180206472">implement rich media interfaces on the internet</a> (and pretty much anything that would connect to the internet, including set-top boxes, wireless devices, and the odd refrigerator). This was filed by Balthaser Online, a one-man operation who happened to think of the idea (filing the application for the patent, that is) before anyone else.<br />
Sound familiar? It should &#8212; a similar sort of broad-ranging patent was filed by Eolas Inc. to handle the method in which plug-ins were included in webpages. That&#8217;s a little thorn in the side of the internet that&#8217;s raged for years, now, with pipsqueak Eolas taking on Microsoft Corporation for over US$520 million in compensation.<br />
Compensation for what? For having an idea? Having <em>just</em> an idea? Where the hell is the value in that? Can anyone tell me why on Earth someone should be awarded over half a billion dollars for an idea? Especially if you didn&#8217;t sell it to someone first?<br />
Both Eolas and Balthaser have something in common: they beat someone else to the punch. They filed patents for things that others were thinking of (or would think of shortly thereafter) &#8212; things that others would expand upon and turn into industry standards and solid techniques. In the case of Eolas, the basic idea of including a plug-in was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium and became the de facto way to include items other than HTML into a given webpage. For Balthaser, they&#8217;ve successfully patented a method for using rich media to present an interface. This includes the use of Flash, Flash, AJAX, and XAML. This affects pretty much every aspect of the much lauded Web 2.0.<br />
But where is the <em>innovation</em>? Sure, they beat everyone else to the punch, but what did those companies do to push their &#8220;inventions&#8221; further? From what we can see, all they did was sit around and wait for the USPTO to approve their patents so they could then turn around and license their patent to those who wanted to use the same ideas, or sue those who refused to cough up the dough.<br />
I side with the companies trying to defend themselves against such ridiculousness &#8212; yes, even Microsoft. I want them to win their little spat against Eolas. Tell me that this makes any sense at all. Did Eolas strike out at every browser maker who has ever used a plug-in? They could have gone after Apple and AOL (owners of Safari and Netscape, respectively). Nope. Just Microsoft. Why? Money, what other possible reason could their be? This is the kind of insipidness that comes as a result of allowing patents on broad concepts that are in development in an industry in several places, or already formed and one person happens to patent it first.<br />
Patents weren&#8217;t intended for &#8220;armchair inventors&#8221; &#8212; they were meant for people who wanted to actually do something with it. Look at the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear">Charles Goodyear</a>, the man credited with inventing (and patenting!) vulcanized rubber. This is a guy who wanted to make a difference, someone who had a vision and was willing to follow that vision to the bitter end. And it was a very hard trail &#8212; he and his family lived in poverty (Goodyear himself was in and out of debtor&#8217;s prison) for most of their lives because of Goodyear&#8217;s obsession with creating vulcanized rubber and trying to market his invention. The poor living conditions led to the death of his son.<br />
Goodyear defended himself in court against a wealthy (and unscrupulous) businessman, Horace Day, who had purchased several of Goodyear&#8217;s first run with the invention &#8212; shoes &#8212; to figure out how it was made so he could duplicate the process. The case, known both as &#8220;Goodyear vs. Day&#8221; and the &#8220;India Rubber Case&#8221; is well-known in patent legal precendent for defending an inventor&#8217;s rights to profit from their hard work.<br />
That&#8217;s the key point of patents &#8212; they&#8217;re a defensive measure, not meant to be a weapon against others. That&#8217;s what most of these new patents seem to be &#8212; an effort to scoop cash because someone had the wherewithal to patent a technique that was already well on the way to development, and not even something they were responsible for coming up with.<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the most recent (potential) offender, Balthaser Online. I loathe to immediately label them as the bad guy, but with the awarded patent, it&#8217;s not looking good. Why? Because Neil Balthaser, the former VP of Strategy for Macromedia, filed a patent in 2001 for &#8220;Methods, Systems and Processes for the Design and Creation of Rich-Media Applications via the Internet&#8221;. This was filed when Flash was already in its third version, so it was hardly a new idea. Balthaser just happened to be the first guy in the door.<br />
But maybe I&#8217;m being too harsh. Maybe I&#8217;ve been too jaded with the silliness of the <a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=39838&amp;DisplayTab=Article">Eolas vs. Microsoft lawsuit</a> or the utter nonsense of the <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1930636,00.asp">NTP vs. RIM lawsuit</a> (I mean, really guys &#8212; are you so callous about money that you&#8217;re willing to cripple communications for hundreds of thousands of people, bringing chaos to the upper echelons of Corporate America?) that I can&#8217;t see anything but ill intent. It&#8217;s possible that Balthaser got the patent to ensure that no-one else did, and will open that patent to everyone thus ensuring that all the developments in the internet since its filing will continue as they should, without impedence or fear that the financial penalty for innovation won&#8217;t prove efforts were for naught.<br />
Having looked at American Capitalism lately, though, I&#8217;m not willing to hold my breath.<br />
The short of this is that the USPTO does not represent the internet. Developments take place in parallel (and often in concert), building on the steps set down by others often not seen until years later (witness the sudden appearance of AJAX, despite the introduction of the core method &#8212; XMLHttpRequest() &#8212; years earlier by Microsoft). Patents filed by those keen only on reaping the rewards of others&#8217; labour serve only to cause problems and financial hardships for those trying to honestly make a difference (and a few bucks, of course).<br />
The USPTO should be restricted to allowing patents where there is proven effort to invent the concept, and <em>continue that innovation</em> to further the idea, market the idea, and do what the giants of the past did &#8212; such as Goodyear &#8212; and <em>earn the right</em> to own that patent. Not just be the first person to put their hand up.<br />
If the change doesn&#8217;t come, maybe I&#8217;ll file a patent for stupidity, so I can sue all the idiots in the world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today, 14 February 2006, is being touted as the day people are to <a href="http://actionnetwork.org/sft/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=3738734">&#8220;break-up&#8221; with Google</a> (also <a href="http://noluv4google.com/article.php?id=801">here</a>). They&#8217;re to sever their relationship, their ties, their love for what is still the most dominant search engine on the internet. It might be losing its top place due to a drop in its relevance (word to Google&#8217;s engineers: you guys gotta tighten that baby up &#8212; MSN is beginning to beat you out), but its popularity has never been stronger.<br />
Which is part of the reason why people are trying to punish Google for censoring itself in China. It&#8217;s a backlash against the Big G to try and remind them of their &#8220;do no evil&#8221; mantra.<br />
It&#8217;s about the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard of.<br />
In recorded history, the actions of a group of people have instigated (either directly or as an end result of continued actions) a change in behaviour of an entity, be it the church, a government, or a company. The belief (no matter how ill-thought) is that by removing the traffic from Google&#8217;s engines, people will somehow force Google into removing the censorship in China, allowing the poor, huddled masses there to see all the material currently forbidden by the Chinese government.<br />
The problem isn&#8217;t that Google is censoring &#8212; it&#8217;s that people believe that <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/tenthings.html">Google&#8217;s moral direction</a> somehow overrides the legality of operating in another country.<br />
Yes, Google is an American company. It follows all the laws and guidelines set within the United States of America. What most people seem to forget is that just because a company is based there doesn&#8217;t mean that it can behave the same way in every other country on the planet.<br />
The traditional Corporation (we&#8217;ll ignore that the internet exists for a moment) starts in Country A, defined by and operating under the laws that govern that nation. When the Corporation wants to do business in Country B, it can either do so across borders (when it is convenient and relatively painless), or it opens a subsidiary to acclimatize to the different conditions. Every country has a specific set of laws that are almost invariably different (not necessarily hostile towards) to the laws in the originating country. The subsidiary allows the Corporation to function internally with minimal changes, and having the subsidiary deal with the legal specifics.<br />
Even between the United States and Canada, there are legal differences. Although almost economically transparent to one another, there are sufficient differences to require significant treaties to allow the exchange of goods and services (witness the US/Canada Auto Pact or NAFTA). The laws that companies operate within are also different, which leads to having specific subsidiaries in Canada. Even companies like Dell and Microsoft &#8212; and yes, even Google &#8212; have Canadian-specific offices to handle Canadian-specific legal requirements.<br />
When Google wants to do business directly within a country, it needs to open an office. This is particularly important when that country is viewed as being a strong source of revenue. (Yes, folks, this is all due to money. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; or not, money is the root of all evil and money rules everything.) Such is the case with China &#8212; it is the next great revenue source for the search engines. Google just happened to be the first to knock on the door.<br />
China has very specific laws when it comes to information. Such is the reality of living within the confines of a oligarchy-ruled &#8220;communist&#8221; nation. You control the masses (and lest we forget that China has over 1.6 billion people) by controlling information. China allows a great deal of information through its borders (having been there, I&#8217;ve seen what is allowed) and offers its people a great deal of freedom.<br />
But to ensure that its society remains harmonious, there are aspects that are not allowed. Anything to do with democracy, freedom of speech, or anything that might incite revolt against the ruling party is viewed to be particularly dangerous. China has a history of particularly violent civil wars &#8212; even if the ruling party weren&#8217;t trying to save their collective butts, it would be a wise policy to allow gradual change rather than end up with an internal conflict on the order of World War I.<br />
This isn&#8217;t about China&#8217;s policies &#8212; this is about others having to recognize that they exist. Google has, much to the chagrin of others. Google has done what a lot of people now view as a violation of Google&#8217;s moral perogative: censored itself. It has done &#8220;evil&#8221;.<br />
There is an interesting allegory to this. There once was a garden. And in this garden grew a tree. The inhabitants of this garden were told never to eat from the tree. Yet they were inticed by a serpent &#8212; a representation of evil &#8212; to ignore what they were told, and eat the delicious fruit, and ultimately learned the horrible truth.<br />
The story of Adam and Eve is often used as a prime example of evil&#8217;s profits. And yet, if we consider Google to be the tree, for it does contain all the collected knowledge &#8230; who is the snake? It&#8217;s not China, for they want that knowledge to remain in the tree, away from those who would eat the tree&#8217;s fruit. Eating that apple is considered evil.<br />
I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s going to stir a few objections &#8212; how dare I consider the allegory to be even remotely equivalent to a company that chooses to side with an &#8220;evil&#8221; country! Like many things, the concept of &#8220;evil&#8221; is highly subjective. We westerners look down on other nations that do not provide the same notions of freedom. We do not see the same societal constructs that have existed elsewhere for centuries. We consider our enlightenment to be the only true way.<br />
If the recent weeks of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy">Muhammad cartoons</a> have not yet taught westerners that absolute belief in our own superiority is a supreme fallacy, I don&#8217;t know what will.<br />
Every company, no matter what medium it exists in or what product or service it offers, must comply with the local laws of the country in which it wishes to do business. For Google to operate in China means it has to contend with the laws that govern China &#8212; that means removing content from their service that are in violation of China&#8217;s information ban. Regardless of how we view China&#8217;s policies, they are what will guide and rule whatever company cares to hang a shingle inside their borders.<br />
Lest we forget, though, it&#8217;s not just China. <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1744845,00.asp">Microsoft got slapped by the EU for Windows Media Player.</a> Last time I checked, I didn&#8217;t hear the west complaining about that. In fact, we were encouraging the EU to fine Microsoft and force changes. This was just the EU enforcing the laws they have adopted, for better or for worse.<br />
And it&#8217;s not to say that Google has become wimpy, either. Remember when the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10925344/">White House demanded records on pornography searches</a> on their indexes? Google refused to hand them over. We lauded them for that. But it wasn&#8217;t because they knew they&#8217;d win the hearts of users. It was their policy not to hand over information that was in potential violation of the law. &#8220;Do no evil&#8221; includes abiding by the laws they operate under.<br />
Google won&#8217;t be the only one. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2006/02/12/afx2519826.html">Yahoo&#8217;s following Google to China.</a> And they are also encountering the laws that have given Google so much trouble. The word &#8220;fight&#8221; has shown up, but it&#8217;s not a fight &#8212; it&#8217;s an adaptation. Yahoo, like Google, will need to consider (and probably will end up) censoring its content if it wants to gain the favour needed to earn money behind the Great Wall. And if <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/02/09/china.yahoo.ap/">China asks for information on one of its users</a>, Yahoo will comply.<br />
So perhaps its time for everyone to pull their highly enlightened heads out of the sand and look around. The world doesn&#8217;t end at North America&#8217;s borders. Things are different out there, and companies have to play by different rules if they wish to earn revenue in other nations. And it doesn&#8217;t matter what moral direction that company says it will follow.<br />
The idea here is to pressure China to change its policies by forcing companies to bring in western ideals. This is not a realisitic perspective. Companies will not force changes in an economy the size of China&#8217;s. It&#8217;s not feasible. Companies are too small, too insignficiant. And they know it. Only governments can inflict changes like the ones activists want to see. They want human rights brought in like those in the west. They want Tibet freed. Google can&#8217;t do that. Yahoo can&#8217;t do that.<br />
You want that kind of change? Get your government to change. They&#8217;re the ones who can influence change through trade sanctions, through changes in diplomatic behaviour. Only when political pressure is enacted will it be possible for change to take place. And China&#8217;s considerable economy is tough to overcome.<br />
Don&#8217;t punish Google (or Yahoo, for that matter) for complying with the laws of another country. Talk to your elected official. Lodge your complaints. Make your voice heard by your government. Only through them will the changes you want to see take place.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate Starbucks.<br />
Not because the word &#8220;Starbucks&#8221; has come to mean anything so popular and prevalent as to find it on every street corner. Not because they&#8217;ve taken the idea of luxury coffee and turned it into a readily-accessible commodity. Not because they charge <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/content/opinion/2004/11/27/the-$5-coffee/">almost five dollars for a coffee</a>.<br />
I hate them because they stopped making Chantico.<br />
What is Chantico? I could use the superlative: &#8220;hot sex in a small cup&#8221;, but even that doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. So I&#8217;ll give you the actual definition: hot whole milk, ground chocolate, a bit of flavour, made really thick. It&#8217;s drinking chocolate. It&#8217;s like heating up a Dairy Milk bar and sucking it back before it resolidifies.<br />
It&#8217;s not for everyone. I know a few people who can&#8217;t stand it. It&#8217;s strong. Really strong. It&#8217;s like a kick to the head compared to regular hot chocolate. (Especially when you ask for a shot of peppermint syrup in it!) But to anyone who loves chocolate, it&#8217;s pure heaven.<br />
And incidentally, I&#8217;m not referring to people who like chocolate who say they love it. You don&#8217;t have an obsession for it. You don&#8217;t start drooling uncontrollably when you see a box of Lindt Lindors. You don&#8217;t go into convulsions when you enter a Bernard Callebaut store. The scent of quality dark chocolate doesn&#8217;t cause blackouts.<br />
I should join Chocolate Lover&#8217;s Anonymous. I know I should. But I can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t want to wean myself off of chocolate. When I see the episode of the Simpson&#8217;s where Homer daydreams that he&#8217;s in the Land of Chocolate &#8212; I <em>identify</em> with that! I think how wonderful a place like that would be! Damn the implications of malnourishment and tooth decay &#8212; it&#8217;s all about the gratification!<br />
That&#8217;s what Chantico is &#8230; or rather, was, for me. It was the little land of chocolate in a small paper container. I weep for the loss, as I know of no replacement for it. My life will likely change now as I embark on a journey to find that replacement. I will search high, low, in, out, up, down, forward, backward, under, over, through, and around every single place I ever happen to be, searching for a recipe, a scrap of knowledge, even a hint of a whisper that I might yet again experience the sheer ecstacy that is drinking chocolate.<br />
So if you do one day come across a poor, broken man on the side of the road who asks you for a chocolate bar, give the poor man pity. It&#8217;s not his fault. The chocolate made me do it.<br />
That is why I hate Starbucks.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Canadians are strange. I know &#8212; I&#8217;m one of them.<br />
In some places in the world, such as our oft-maligned (deservably or not) neighbour to the south, people vote for a person and the position/platform that they take in the course of presented themselves to the electorate. The fact that they belong to a specific political party is often inconsequential.<br />
We Canucks are a strange lot, however: We&#8217;ll actually vote out completely competant and capable people, or somehow magically organize ourselves nationwide to vote out a party in retaliation for things they&#8217;ve done during their administration. It&#8217;s our polite way of taking revenge.<br />
Canada took revenge on the Liberals. After a decade of ruling the country, we decided to give them the heave-ho in favour of the only other politically-viable party: the Conservatives. Thankfully, we collectively had the sanity to only give the Conservatives a minority government &#8212; the baby managed to hang onto the tub while we threw out the bathwater.<br />
Do I like the fact that the Conservatives are in? Not particularly. I don&#8217;t much like the right-of-right-wing idealism that has spun out of that group in the last couple of years. I didn&#8217;t mind the Progressive Conservative party back in the day. Periodically inane, yes, and were effectively decimated to two lousy seats following the Mulrooney era, but all-in-all weren&#8217;t that bad.<br />
Canadians have a short memory. People seem to forget that it was because of the Liberals that we have most of the social policies that we do today. Remember, if it weren&#8217;t for Trudeau, the state would have poked its nose into the bedrooms of the nation probably well into the 1970s. Following Mulrooney&#8217;s retirement from office (wisely chosen mere months before a federal election eliminated the PCs of official party status in the House of Commons) &#8230; anyone remember why?<br />
Oh, and anyone ever really notice that the dropped &#8220;Progressive&#8221; from the party name? That should be an indication of how willing the Conservatives are willing to look forward. The Conservatives are intersted in status quo &#8212; the one of years&#8217; past.<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m in no way trying to absolve the Liberals of wrongdoing. There were serious violations of protocol, and people knew about it. At least internally. It wasn&#8217;t until the Gomery Inquiry that things came more to light. It was a mess. The ruling party was involved. And darn it, that just ain&#8217;t Canadian!<br />
Let&#8217;s ignore one of the more crucial facts: Not all the Liberals were involved in the scandal. In fact, most of the shenanigans took place with federal employees &#8212; people the electorate have no control over. People who might still be there. Certainly, if nothing else, the poisoned environment still exists. Things might have gotten quieter, but does it mean that the corruption has been purged? I&#8217;m willing to suggest it&#8217;s not.<br />
The part that worries me most of all this is how much we&#8217;re going to be set back. The Conservatives (so aptly named) are scared of anything that go against what they consider normal. They will do everything in their (albeit limited) power to take away rights bestowed to groups, takea way the legislation geared to making Canada safer and open, and abolishing systems we have come to depend on. Oh, and the child care thing? Harper &#8212; please take a lesson from Quebec. They&#8217;re the only ones who have this figured out.<br />
How long the Conservatives stay in the lead role remains to be seen. Minority governments generally don&#8217;t last long because before too long, they either make a mistake and are forced to set a new election, get overly cocky and want to hold an election to get more seats, or the other parties gang up and end up dissolving the house &#8212; and bringing about another election. I speculate they&#8217;ll play it safe as long as possible to stay in power as long as possible. Make enough good in-roads with the rest of Canada, and they might pull of a majority government.<br />
The next few years will be interesting, to say the least. And I sincerely hope it&#8217;s not a disasterous four years.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Minority governments are always a touchy thing. This is something the Americans have trouble with &#8212; in a two-party system, you don&#8217;t get minority governments, just slim margins. In multiple party systems (three or more), it&#8217;s possible to have a situation where the ruling party doesn&#8217;t have a majority of the seats in the legislative house. When that happens, fewer decisions can be effectively made, and the whole political process slows down even more than usual.<br />
And that&#8217;s a pretty darn scary thought, when you get right down to it.<br />
Seventeen months ago, that&#8217;s exactly what happened in Canada. We hadn&#8217;t seen a federal minority government for quite some time, mostly because people remember how successful the last one was. People tended to vote either for the Progressive Conservatives (now just the Conservative Party) or the Liberals. A few people would vote for the NDP (mostly in British Columbia, it would seem), or the Bloc Quebecois; but one of the Tories or the Liberals would usually run the House of Commons.<br />
Seventeen months ago, after a few rounds of Liberal governments, the Canadian population decided to get &#8220;strategic&#8221;. Every time this happens, it means a minority government. Oddly enough, this is what Canadians &#8220;want&#8221;, because it means we get a bit of a break of one party acting like they own the place. That means fewer decisions, and less rocking of the boat.<br />
Now, given, the Liberals were the ones boat-rocking. Normally, they&#8217;re pretty &#8230; well, dull. They do some nice stuff, they do some not-so-nice stuff, but they&#8217;re middle-of-the-road. They&#8217;re centre. They&#8217;re Liberals. But the whole <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/groupaction/sponsorship_inquiries.html">Sponsorship Scandal</a> really threw a wrench in the works, and brought the Liberals out as looking like the bad guys.<br />
Okay, yes, they did try to hide the facts. And the funds were being redirected back into the Liberal coffers. And they tried to deny it. And a couple of Liberal people were involved. Yeah, things aren&#8217;t all that rosey, when you start to look into it.<br />
So the leaders of the three major opposition parties (<a href="http://www.conservative.ca/EN/biography/">Stephen Harper</a>, Conservative Party; <a href="http://www.ndp.ca/bio/">Jack Layton</a>, NDP; and <a href="http://www.blocquebecois.org/fr/equipe_detail.asp?ID=58">Gilles Duceppe</a>, Bloc Québécois) banded together to take the Liberals out.<br />
Right before Christmas.<br />
Thanks a lot, guys. We really appreciate this. I mean, how much better could the holiday season possibly get now that we have to not only contend with the over-commercialization of a formerly holy Christian holiday (replete with way too many red-tag sales and far too much Kenny G&#8217;s &#8220;Greatest Holiday Classics&#8221;) than to also endure the intolerable jackhammer chatter of &#8220;vote for me or my opponent will ruin this country&#8221;.<br />
Yeah, there&#8217;s a cheery message for the season.<br />
Okay, while we&#8217;re on the topic, let&#8217;s look at a few things&#8230;<br />
The Conservative Party. Led by the unthinkable Stephen Harper. When the mere suggestion of same-sex marriage came up, the first thing he was happy to pronounce was that when he was elected, he would table legislation to have it removed from the law books. Now that he is looking at election square in the face, he&#8217;s actually pulled back a bit. Why? Easy &#8212; he&#8217;s got to look good to southern Ontario, the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, most of Quebec, and a good chunk of the Maritime Provinces who perceive him as a fanatical right-wing racist homophobic nutjob. Given some of the wonderful things that he&#8217;s said over the years (<a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/s/stephen_harper.html">the silly and the stupid</a>, and while I hate to have a &#8220;they say, he says&#8221; thing going on, I rather like the Liberal&#8217;s idea for a <a href="http://www.stephenharpersaid.ca/">campaign against Stephen Harper</a>), how can we take this guy seriously? At least King Ralph has the history of being an alcoholic with which to pass of some of the strange things that he&#8217;s uttered.<br />
The Liberals. Been in power a few too many years, some would suggest. They&#8217;re not reliable, they&#8217;re dishonest, bla bla bla. Spotless record? Heck no. Name a political party in <strong>any</strong> country that&#8217;s got a spotless record. About as easy as finding a vegan in Alberta&#8217;s cattle country. Paul Martin&#8217;s regarded as the most credible of the leaders up for the top seat, but he only comes in at 34%. Why not more? Scandals do damage. Mr. Martin might think he did a good job keeps arm&#8217;s distance from the whole thing, but let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; there&#8217;s been some real shady things going on in the Ruling House, and given Paul&#8217;s neck-deep interest (remember that he was Finance Minister for a long time; you don&#8217;t hold a position like that and not know a few things) he can&#8217;t come out squeaky clean.<br />
The NDP. The Shiny, Happy People Party. The Things Are Always Perfect Party Even If We Don&#8217;t Really Understand What We&#8217;re Doing Party. Okay, maybe that last one was a little unfair, but generally speaking, the NDP haven&#8217;t done a particularly good job when they manage to get into power. Witness Saskatchewan, Ontario (for that brief period in the 1990s), and British Columbia. The NDP generally have the right idea, but their implementation stinks. Ironically enough, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Rae">former Ontario premier Bob Rae</a> was one of the best politicians Canada has seen since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> &#8230; but he only figured it out about a year before the NDP were all but laid waste in a provincial election. The Federal NDP are led by Jack Layton, a former Toronto city councillor. He was an able person who did a good job of representing his riding in the now mega-city. But that wasn&#8217;t enough &#8212; he wanted to represent Toronto in Canada.<br />
And that&#8217;s his problem. Just like Harper doesn&#8217;t understand anything outside of the conservative west, Martin doesn&#8217;t understand the west, Duceppe doesn&#8217;t give a crap for anything outside of Quebec (and probably not for Anglo Montreal, either), Layton doesn&#8217;t get anything outside of Toronto. Sure, he&#8217;s <em>been</em> outside of Toronto, but he doesn&#8217;t get it. He&#8217;s been there too long. If Jack&#8217;s to get any credibility, he needs to live in Truro, Campbellton, Churchill, Prince Albert, Yellowknife, and Kamloops for a few months each. Yes, Toronto is the economic hub of Canada, but as I&#8217;ve learned myself, there&#8217;s a lot more to this country than the corner of Yonge and Dundas. Is he a capable politician? Heck yes &#8212; he worked out a deal with the Liberals to push through a budget, with a few conditions of his own. That&#8217;s well-used power. Can he do that if it were only the NDP in power? Don&#8217;t hold your breath&#8230;<br />
And then there&#8217;s the Bloc. Do I really need to review these guys? Gilles Duceppe doesn&#8217;t care about the rest of Canada. All he wants is separation, and he doesn&#8217;t even understand why. It&#8217;s not because of French culture (if he believes that Anglo Canada is trying to wipe it out, he needs to live out in BC for a while, immerse himself in the Anglo society, then move back &#8212; then he&#8217;ll see how distinctive and wonderful it truly is). It&#8217;s not because of French politics (Quebec uses civil law, unlike the rest of Canada &#8212; and big surprise, it works just fine without any interference from anyone else). It&#8217;s not for money (Quebec is largely dependent on transfers from the Federal government, much of which comes from Ontario and Alberta). So what&#8217;s the big chip on your shoulder, Gilles? What do you like about the rest of us? We smell or something? Not like the Bloc could ever actually take over as the ruling party &#8212; because of their limited span, they couldn&#8217;t get enough seats to pull that off. And in all honesty, they&#8217;re about the best opposition party because they hate everything the ruling party does.<br />
The big cry is the sweeping change: Get the Liberals out, get us (&#8220;us&#8221; being one of the opposition parties at hand) in, and things will get better.<br />
But will they? Based purely on track record, the NDP would likely screw up the finances. (People say the Liberals already did, but they were the ones who brought the debt under control and have managed to actually produce surpluses.) There would be more programs, yes, but before long taxes would have to go up. The Tories would no doubt try to live up to their idiotic promise of reducing the GST &#8230; which would no doubt backfire once the coffers run dry due to all the cuts in taxes given to all their friends in business, or so history suggests. Oh, and then there&#8217;s that minor setback in equal rights as they squash all the progress we&#8217;ve made, but who would really notice that, any way? The Liberals would likely do status quo. But after over a decade of the same tune, do you really want to keep listening?<br />
Whoever ends up in power still has one minor problem: All that infrastructure that made the Sponsorship Scandal work? Still there. All the ineffiiencies? Still there. All the duct tape holding parts of our fragile goverment together? Still there. Voting out the ruling party doesn&#8217;t get rid of it. It doesn&#8217;t go away.<br />
So yes, we have ourselves a wonderful Christmas present: We get to think about all the problems we have with our Feds and try to make some sort of an educated decision that might somehow make our lives better.<br />
But we won&#8217;t. Fact is, we have no clear options. All of them have their flaws. All of them fail to see the forest for the trees. All of them fail to see past the political daycare centre that we elected them into, complete with same the squabbling, toy-hogging, paste-eating mentality we see in people one tenth their age.<br />
Better buy yourselves something nice for Christmas, folks. With luck, it&#8217;ll put you in a good enough mood to survive until late January.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Y&#8217;know, I used to believe that all the really shady governmental meddling always happened south of the border.<br />
Little did I know that our own government has been setting the stage to run things that we&#8217;d been taking for granted. I caught this first on SlashDot (news for nerds), which directed me to the appropriate article on the Toronto Star website.<br />
It&#8217;s quite freaky, actually. The short version of the story is that <a href="http://canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/">Canadian law enforcement wants near-direct access</a> to any information an Telecommunications Service Provider (TSP) might have regarding their users or the information their users transmit over a TSP&#8217;s systems. Without court orders and without having to inform the users. The TSP has no legal recourse but to cough up the goods or face fines and jail time.<br />
Awfully heavy-handed, if you ask me. This is not the usual behaviour of our spend-millions-on-useless-inquests governments. Someone&#8217;s been taking lessons from Uncle Sam.<br />
There&#8217;s a dual impact: not only are our rights to privacy completely ignored (and didn&#8217;t we just <a href="http://www.privcom.gc.ca/legislation/index_e.asp">finish putting in privacy laws</a>?), but there&#8217;s a huge financial cost to the TSPs. Three guesses where that cost will be transferred to? Hello, $50 residential phone service.<br />
But where is this all coming from? The majority of it is the internet, which relies heavily on the TSPs for carrying the signals around the country. The internet scares many people, and it&#8217;s not just the grandmothers of the world who hear about the &#8220;web&#8221; and think of a room full of spiders. It scares legislators because the internet has long been out of the reach of the law.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say people haven&#8217;t tried. Regulation has had some effect in the United States. If you call <a href="http://news.com.com/RIAA+settles+with+12-year-old+girl/2100-1027_3-5073717.html">suing a 12 year-old kid for sharing music</a> files effective, anyway. Here in the Great Not-Quite-White North (all the snow is gone in Calgary), it&#8217;s been hands off. Or so we thought.<br />
It seems the hands were under the table, trying to tap into the phone lines. The government wants to know what we&#8217;re up to. Telephones, email, FTP transmissions, binary streaming data, even VoIP access. And since the internet also runs across cable providers, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if venerable televisions falls under the harsh gaze of the <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/">RCMP</a>, or even <a href="http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/">CSIS</a>.<br />
The world changed, and we didn&#8217;t notice. We just went along for the ride. But the fear that the world is running unchecked is worrying some up on Parliament Hill, and they want control. Perhaps not direct control, as in North Korea, but they want to know when we&#8217;re not behaving.<br />
That&#8217;s all fine &#8212; we put governments in place so we don&#8217;t have to deal with the monotony of Big Picture hassles. That&#8217;s what governments do. Did we give them permission to read our emails? Without a court order, I think not.<br />
The legislation currently going through is wide-ranging, and it sounds like it&#8217;s pretty vague. They&#8217;ll be able to define it however they want, and the only victim is every single Canadian who dares to pick up a phone.<br />
I&#8217;m curious to know the underlying reasons. No doubt that fear is an issue &#8212; fear that the government doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on under the covers. Fear that the <a href="http://www.crtc.gc.ca/">CRTC</a> can&#8217;t control what goes on over the internet. Fear that the telecoms might suffer as a result of VoIP.<br />
Technology changes at orders of magnitude faster than anyone in the government can comprehend. By the time you finish reading this, something else big will be on its way. Governments cannot expect to manage something like this without having the capability of understanding it.<br />
Perhaps that means we need a Ministry of Information. Yes, that rings of <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a> and <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/combined">Brazil</a>, but that&#8217;s not my view. It&#8217;s a place where people can understand the technical infrastructure of Canada. What&#8217;s going on in those phone lines, and what kind of recommendations can be made to make sure that everyone plays nice, and we don&#8217;t impede upon the rights of others. (Like our privacy, for example.)<br />
The world won&#8217;t ever stop changing. That means we need to change. And so does the Government&#8217;s thinking.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;m an avid reader of Yahoo!&#8217;s <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=index&amp;cid=757">Oddly Enough</a> news section. Usually because it&#8217;s full of irreverent blurbs. Every so often, there&#8217;s something that creeps in there that actually ticks me off.<br />
Ever heard of the Bavarian Purity Act of 1516? It&#8217;s also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinheitsgebot">Reinheitsgebot</a>. Basically, it makes sure that your finely crafted German beer is as finely crafted as the price you paid.<br />
For almost 500 years, the law has stated that there would be only four ingredients in German beer: malt, hops, yeast, and water. That was partly for political reasons (e.g. bakers getting their wheat) but also to make sure that shifty brewers wouldn&#8217;t take shortcuts.<br />
Well, some bozo felt it was a good idea to challenge the law because he wanted to add sugar to his product. Never mind the half-MILLENNIUM of tradition and quality. Never mind that the Bavarian Purity Act is even used as a marketing gimmick for other beers around the world. No, sorry, we have to put sugar in ours and still call it beer.<br />
Jerks.<br />
So they managed to convince the courts, after a decade, that the Bavarian Purity Act should be weakened. One day, sadly, it will probably have no oomph at all, and will be merely a distant memory.<br />
So raise a glass of [insert favourite German beer here], &#8230; cuz it won&#8217;t be long before it won&#8217;t be just &#8220;beer&#8221; anymore.</p>
