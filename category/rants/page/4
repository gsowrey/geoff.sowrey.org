	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I read a lot of <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/03/ajax_promise_or.html">blogs</a>. It&#8217;s about the best way I have of keeping up with the trends in the industry. But there&#8217;s one trend out there that&#8217;s really beginning to bother me. A lot.<br />
<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax</a>.<br />
It&#8217;s an acronym/abbreviation for &#8220;Asynchronous Javascript with XML&#8221;. It&#8217;s this supposedly wonderful technique that solves a wonderful array of problems by introducing XML into advanced Javascript methods.<br />
News flash, folks, this ain&#8217;t new. This has been around since <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/02/09/xml-http-request.html">XMLHTTPRequest</a> was introduced with IE 5.0 in March, 1999. (It&#8217;s still not officially standardized by anyone, especially the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA</a>, who until now has kept up with the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-262.htm">specification of the scripting language</a> we generally call &#8220;Javascript&#8221;.) Despite being available for so long, no-one really put it to use until Google slapped in place for <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a>. Suddenly, everyone took notice.<br />
Apparently, having read around a little more about Ajax, I&#8217;ve come to a conclusion that I don&#8217;t intend to ever use &#8220;Ajax&#8221;. I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://www.forgetfoo.com/?p=2&amp;blogid=2965">XMLHTTPRequest</a> when needed, and I&#8217;ll make a point of using advanced Javascript, again when needed. But I won&#8217;t use &#8220;Ajax&#8221;. Because as far as I&#8217;m concerned, it doesn&#8217;t exist.<br />
Okay, yes, it&#8217;s a catchy name &#8212; that I won&#8217;t deny. But is it worthy of the recognition? Hmm&#8230; well, maybe just a little. Enough that it attracts attention and gets people to think about techniques they might not have previously considered. In a way &#8220;Ajax&#8221; will serve the same purpose &#8220;DHTML&#8221; once did.<br />
For those of you newer to the field, &#8220;DHTML&#8221; isn&#8217;t a technology. In fact, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHTML">DHTML</a> mirrors Ajax in many ways. It&#8217;s a technique, and the parts aren&#8217;t all required. DHTML was a marketing gimmick Microsoft came up with to sell the blending of HTML, CSS, and JScript (remember, Microsoft doesn&#8217;t acknowledge Java at all). The idea was that this powerful &#8220;new&#8221; technology would solve a lot of problems.<br />
When DHTML was first proposed, it caught a lot of buzz in the field. And rightfully so, because at the time, most people were mired in <font> tags, bgcolor attributes, and tables for layout. DHTML would solve those woes and turn people towards the standards they were supposed to use.<br />
It&#8217;s odd that Microsoft would be the one to drive many towards standards, especially since they didn&#8217;t formalize any of them. (Though Microsoft did come up with a lot of the ideas that are now the standards .) And change we did, though not entirely to Microsoft&#8217;s urging &#8212; we also have the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> and their efforts to thank.<br />
The effect, however, will likely be the same. Ajax will direct those who&#8217;d never really thought past simple image replacement scripts to now think about making their sites more functional and more engaging than ever before. XML isn&#8217;t a requirement, but it is a convenient part of making it all work. In time, Ajax will likely serve the same purpose DHTML did.<br />
Okay, so maybe I&#8217;ve been a little too harsh. Ajax does serve a purpose. And it will continue to be talked about. I just hope the discussion is intelligent and comprehensible. I want the people reading about Ajax to understand that it is not a silver bullet, and what exactly Ajax does and how they can use it.<br />
Mostly because I&#8217;m sick of seeing &#8220;DHTML&#8221; on resumes, and I&#8217;m not keen to see &#8220;Ajax&#8221; show up there with the same level of ignorance.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>My friend <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/">Scott</a> now works for the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">#2 search engine</a>. He definitely earned the privilege to be called for the job.<br />
Recently, he had the luxury of having <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/">Eric Meyer</a> and <a href="http://www.molly.com/">Molly Holzschlag</a> visit to give a little talk on CSS2. (Things that will probably never happen here, sadly.)<br />
Anyway, Eric made a comment at the end that <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/content/entries/2005/02/19/writing-html-like-1993">Scott took a strong liking</a> to:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you&#8217;re writing HTML like Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, you&#8217;re doing a good job.<br />
<cite>Eric Meyer</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I understand where that comment is coming from. Back in 1993, the current standard for HTML was 1.0 (2.0 was only an Internet Draft at the time). That meant that the HTML was exceedingly simple: nothing fancier than the structural elements we needed to build a page. (Tables weren&#8217;t spec&#8217;d until HTML 3.2.)<br />
For the basis of the quote (at least as I understand it, not having actually spoken with Eric Meyer about this), I completely see the need. Keep your (X)HTML simple and don&#8217;t try to use elements for something they weren&#8217;t intended for.<br />
That said, I have an issue with this quote: It&#8217;s using a standard that wasn&#8217;t strict on syntax. The official standard, <a href="http://w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML 1.0</a>, allowed you to create HTML documents that had no closing tags. Though <a href="http://w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/">HTML 2.0</a> took it a step further and listed the closing tags in many cases, it was never really that clear. (I didn&#8217;t get into the habit until the mid-90s, myself.)<br />
Why do I have a problem with that? Eric&#8217;s not suggesting that people should write malformed code &#8212; that much I know without having to talk to him. However, people might construe that malformed code is okay. It isn&#8217;t.<br />
We&#8217;re dealing with a technology that has allowed us to move to strongly define the markup language. The standard I try to follow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/">XHTML 1.0</a> (only because not all browsers support XHTML 1.1), and I&#8217;m waiting anxiously for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml2/">XHTML 2.0</a>) is strict, and blissfully so. Not following that standard leads to breakdown in layouts, and in large documents, more work finding the errors. <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C&#8217;s validator</a> can only do so much.<br />
Some find strictness hard, because it does require discipline. Once you&#8217;ve gotten into the habit, though, is the discipline that bad? If it makes your life easier, if you can code faster as a result (less debugging), and if support becomes less painful, shouldn&#8217;t that be a good thing?<br />
Personally, I&#8217;d rather write XHTML like it&#8217;s 2005 (or 2006, depending on when XHTML 2.0 comes out).</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our world is changing. It changes every day. Sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse. Overall, the trend is &#8220;better&#8221;. Or so one would believe over the last few years.<br />
Let&#8217;s flip back to the 1960s. Racial integration within the Americas (the United States and Canada, to be specific). Back then, racial integration was the huge topic. We&#8217;d gotten past the days of Rosa Parks, who&#8217;d single-handedly kicked off the turning point in equality. Now we were dealing with another shocking problem: love between the races. How could a white girl marry a black man? (Or a white man a Chinese woman, etc.)<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how people react to open-mindedness. There were those who supported the movement. And there were those who vehemently objected. (Interestingly enough, the objectors were in every case far more violent than the supporters. Draw your own conclusions.) Eventually, reason prevailed.<br />
&#8220;What reason?!&#8221; cries the Moral Right. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t no reason a white woman should marry anything but a white man.&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s the idea of racial purity. Whites should stick with whites, blacks with black, asians with asians, and so forth. It&#8217;s the idea that you dilute the race when you intermix. Or at least that&#8217;s what I assume it to be. It&#8217;s sometimes hard to get a straight answer from the objectors &#8212; they tend to mumble a bit as they froth at the mouth.<br />
Today, interracial marriage is accepted in the open-minded areas of the Americas (most of Canada, the Blue States, and major cities within the Red States), tolerated in others. In a few cases, you&#8217;d be best to be walking several steps apart from each other as not to lead onto the possibility that there&#8217;s a familial link of any kind. Thankfully, those are few and far between.<br />
So imagine my surprise during the U.S. elections back in November. You&#8217;d think we&#8217;d swung back 40 years. Suddenly, States that seemed to be rolling in reason were rolling back the clock. Laws outright banning same sex marriages. Even the thought of marriage between two men caused people to be physically ill.<br />
In Canada, we were running the other direction. British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Yukon Territory, Newfoundland, Quebec, and even venerable Saskatchewan realized that there was no reason why homosexuals couldn&#8217;t be married, and made it legal. (Although Nova Scotia had an interesting twist to it &#8230; provincial law required one partner to be the &#8220;wife&#8221; and the other to be the &#8220;husband&#8221;, no matter what the sex was.)<br />
Alberta, being the closest thing Canada has to a Red State, naturally objected, declaring the end of the world if same sex unions were approved. King Ralph even declared that he&#8217;d use the &#8220;Notwithstanding Clause&#8221; to opt out of the Canadian Bill of Rights so he wouldn&#8217;t be forced to accept a homosexual married couple as his neighbour.<br />
I mean, really, how does this guy keep getting reelected?<br />
The Canadian Supreme Court ruled about a month ago that the final decision on Gay Marriage would not sit with them. As far as they were concerned, the law was clear: it&#8217;s a Legislative matter. A political hot potato / buck-passing to dump it on Parliment Hill to resolve. Ultimately, it will require a passage of a Bill to decide whether or not my friends Amy and Sandra can get married.<br />
Yes, I have a particular attachment to this issue. But not just because I have gay friends who want to get married. I have an attachment because I believe in equality.<br />
Yes, this is all about equality. You can sit there and postulate all you want. It&#8217;s about equality. If you live in North America, if you believe in the democratic system, then you must by nature believe in equality. There is no practical difference between the sexes (reproductive systems notwithstanding), nor are there any between the races (reproductive sizes, real or imagined, notwithstanding). So why should there be any between sexual orientations?<br />
The single biggest argument I&#8217;ve heard against gay marriage is that the Bible doesn&#8217;t allow for it. I have two challenges to that. First, show me the exact passage that denies gay marriage. There&#8217;s one about a man lying with another man (or rather forbidding it), but that does not extend to marriage. You can infer all you want, but if you&#8217;re reading the Bible as an instruction manual, you&#8217;ll need to pull the exact quote. As for my second point, just to be really picky, Canada and the United States separated the church and state well over a century ago to prevent interference with the operation of each. In other words, the Bible has nothing to do with it.<br />
Not to mention the fact that marriage is a legal issue, not necessarily a religious one. Sure, there will be those who want a religious ceremony &#8212; that&#8217;s a decision for the specific religious sect, not for the lawmakers. There is secular marriage, where the law does apply. What does the law provide? A legal union of two people in entity. It allows the bonds of family to be formally created and legally binding, for better or for worse. Frankly, if two gay men want to have the same grief that comes with some of the marriages I&#8217;ve seen, I say let &#8217;em go for it!<br />
&#8220;Wait a cotton-pickin&#8217; minute! I don&#8217;t want two fags to marry because someone might think I married a man!&#8221;<br />
That afraid of your own sexuality, eh? I mean, really, how paranoid do you have to be to think that anyone is a) going to think that you married someone of the same sex (unless it&#8217;s really blatantly obvious), or b) even remotely care? Let&#8217;s have a reality check for one moment. The vast majority of people are heterosexual. That means the majority of marriages are heterosexual. That means the majority of people will be thinking you would be married to someone of the *opposite* sex. If anything, it&#8217;ll be homosexuals getting offended because people will think they married someone of the opposite sex.<br />
It&#8217;s equality, people. Get a dose of reality. Get your heads out of the sand and look around. What, really, would change if gays were allow to marry? Absolutely nothing. Your life wouldn&#8217;t change one iota. Not one freaking bit.<br />
It&#8217;s the idea of sexual mixing. The fear that if homosexuality were treated the same as heterosexuality, that it might &#8220;bleed&#8221; into the rest of the pool, and suddenly make that guy standing next to you look just as attractive as that woman on the other side of the bus. This, for some reason, terrifies people. Be a little rational, will you? If the thought of sleeping with a member of the same sex revulses you now, it still will six months, six years, and six decades from now. You&#8217;re set in your ways. Your children will be unaffected, as will their children, so on and so on.<br />
Tolerance will be important. Everyone needs to understand that, like with race, homosexuality isn&#8217;t an underclass. They are the same as everyone else. They have the same rights as you and I on an individual basis. On paper, we are all exactly the same. (Well, except for the Native Indians. They continue to get the shaft from society, but that&#8217;s another rant for another time.) If we are all the same individually, why should we not be the same together?<br />
The vote hasn&#8217;t come yet in Canada, but it&#8217;s coming soon. To all Canadian Members of Parliment: Please be rational. Don&#8217;t think with your gut &#8212; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s caused all this trouble. Think with your head. Think with the law in mind. Remember that the issue is not about religion, it&#8217;s not about sexuality. It&#8217;s about equality. Homosexuals deserve the right to marry as much as anyone else in this country (of legal age, that is).<br />
And this is coming from a guy who&#8217;s getting married himself. I have the right to marry. I want my friends to have that same right.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The Shrub is back for another four years. Oh. Joy.<br />
Did no-one realize what kind of moron is at the head of the US Government? I can only guess not, as the United States again voted in one of the most dangerous men on the planet. The guy freaks me out. Arrogant, ignorant, and brash. A bad combination for a politician.<br />
The problem is the Democrats. They need to find someone with more personality than a telephone pole. Kerry, in case you haven&#8217;t noticed, is rather dull. Actually, nix that. Gore was rather dull. Kerry is Xanax incarnate. If you have any hope against charisma (no matter how evil it seems), you need to put in someone who can at least look and sound more than a mere talking head!<br />
Bush had my favourite line-to-hate from politicians: &#8220;America has spoken&#8221;. Spoken. With 51% of the vote. That&#8217;s not really saying much when you consider that <em>every second person voted against you</em>! If that&#8217;s what you call speaking up in a crowd, it&#8217;s no wonder you&#8217;re not listening to your constituents.<br />
Oh, right, you are listening. Corporate America and ill-gotten influence. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Let&#8217;s recap on Bush&#8217;s first term: After 9/11 (and his reputed 40% vacation time), he drums up the support to go after Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Makes a complete mess by forcing out the Taliban and is unable to find the person he&#8217;s looking for. Yells at Canada for not helping. (Take a guess who&#8217;s going to spend decades keeping the peace after you&#8217;re gone, ya yutz?)<br />
Unable to stop Bin Laden, but still needing a victory, goes after Iraq and Saddam Hussein, the &#8220;most dangerous man alive&#8221;.<br />
Hussein. In the Iraqi economic wasteland. Dangerous to whom? Even Israel says he&#8217;s more of a minor irritation externally. He&#8217;s more dangerous to himself with his paranoia and germophobia.<br />
Oh, right. Corporate America. Oil. Silly me&#8230;<br />
Claims of weapons of mass destruction are realized to be mere words: weapons of mass <em>distraction</em> to give Bush the &#8220;right&#8221; to wreak havoc and kill a lot of innocent people. And you think Hussein is dangerous? Boy, look in the mirror sometime.<br />
Yet again, the US has to go in en masse to clean up a puppet they set up before and let run amok. (Witness Noriega and Castro.) Some regimes never learn.<br />
Interestingly enough, the world (courtesy of globalvote.org) voted for Kerry. We hoped that Kerry would be a tad more honest and wouldn&#8217;t be so keen to wage war on another country somewhere. Sadly, given his waffling, the US ended up with a &#8220;devil you don&#8217;t know&#8221; problem. What would Kerry actually do?<br />
So welcome to another four years of hollow rhetoric, shallow lies, and more fodder for late night talk show hosts and documentary filmmakers. Let&#8217;s just hope this doesn&#8217;t go anymore to his head than it already has.<br />
Oh, and I have to ask, what&#8217;s with Americans turning so homophobic &#8212; what&#8217;s the big deal, eh?</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I went for a walk at lunch today. I do this every so often, sometimes to get some fresh air, sometimes to avoid the sheer insanity of the office, or sometimes to get lunch outside of the Bistro. Today&#8217;s little jaunt took me past Olympic Plaza and Jack Singer Hall.<br />
Now this location is of importance, not because it&#8217;s a nice place to walk, but because of something horrifying that I happened to see as I walked westward.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t a murder, though I would almost consider it on the same level of offensiveness. It wasn&#8217;t a massive pile of horse manure, though it stinks just as badly. And to be certain, it wasn&#8217;t a giant pimple, though the sight was just as repulsive.<br />
It was fake fir, copied conifer, fabricated flora, hoaxed herbology, swindled shrub, trick trees. It was in the process of being wrapped around poles, unwrapped from huge roles; it was hung across wires, strung above busy noon buyers. It was spackled with bells and balls; it looked like it was right out of shopping malls!<br />
&#8220;Excuse me&#8230; are these Christmas decorations?&#8221; I asked, nervously.<br />
&#8220;Uh, yeah&#8230;&#8221; said the woman tying off a bunch of evergreen, worried what my reaction might be.<br />
Uh, did we suddenly get stuck in a time warp? Is it already mid-November? Hmm&#8230; let&#8217;s check the calendar, shall we? Oh, look at that. It&#8217;s not even close to December&#8230;<br />
That&#8217;s because IT&#8217;S STILL FREAKING SEPTEMBER! SUMMER&#8217;S NOT EVEN OVER YET!<br />
I really want to know what set off some idiot&#8217;s grand scheme to hang Christmas decorations this early in the year. It&#8217;s bad enough that we haven&#8217;t even seen Thanksgiving or Hallowe&#8217;en yet! It&#8217;s still over a week until the end of *this* month, let alone two more entire months before December.<br />
Now I realize that it&#8217;s entirely possible that said decorations might be for a movie or television shoot. It wouldn&#8217;t be unheard of. But it didn&#8217;t really look like a set of any kind. There were no directors, no assistant directors, no lackeys running about with radios looking like they&#8217;re important when they&#8217;re actually running for coffee &#8230; it looked like the City was actually getting ready for Christmas.<br />
This worries me (if you haven&#8217;t already noticed). How on Earth can we expect to have a decent Christmas if we are bombarded with it for over a quarter of the year? It&#8217;s not special then! It&#8217;s just annoying. It&#8217;s a season onto itself, bereft of any special meaning whatsoever. There are so many people who worry about the lack of spiritualism in our Christian holidays &#8230; gee, I wonder why? They&#8217;ve all be commercialized, marketized, oversized, popularized, televised, aerobicized, and menialized.<br />
*Sigh*<br />
I really hope Christmas hasn&#8217;t come yet. It&#8217;s too warm, it&#8217;s too early, all the leaves are still on the trees. I&#8217;m not ready to see some fat white guy in a bad red suit. I can&#8217;t bear to hear &#8220;The Twelve Days of Christmas&#8221; when I&#8217;m still listening to summer music.<br />
But most of all, I&#8217;ve got no idea what to get Alex for Christmas.<br />
<em>[Ed. Note: As it turns out, the decorations were in fact being put up by a filming crew. Hopefully, they won&#8217;t last long.]</em></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are some rumours I understand. And there are others that I do not. There are some that I begin. But this is one I want to end.<br />
For years &#8212; literally, years &#8212; there is a rumour that&#8217;s been floating around Calgary that Critical Mass is going to lose the Mercedes-Benz USA account. We hear it every so often, usually from people in the industry or trying to get into the industry. But only people who work in Calgary &#8212; never from anywhere else. We used to hear this a lot more a couple of years ago. Back then, it was more a irritation. So imagine my surprise when it came up in an interview today.<br />
I think the last time I heard this rumour was when I&#8217;d been out with Virgil a couple of years ago (long before Chris left for Japan). I can&#8217;t quite remember the details, but Virgil&#8217;s friend was convinced we were going to lose the account, and his company was just going to sweep in there and take the business from us.<br />
What kills me is that this seems to be the prevailing attitude: that when Critical Mass loses the Mercedes-Benz USA account, someone in Calgary is going to get it. Okay, let&#8217;s have a little reality check here, okay? Critical Mass is about 200 people (don&#8217;t ask me for a specific number, simply because I don&#8217;t have one to give). If that 200 people, about 60 work on it full-time. That&#8217;s over 25% of our entire workforce, dedicated to a single account. Most interactive companies in Calgary aren&#8217;t 60 people in total, let alone that many to spare.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s assume for the moment that maybe &#8212; JUST MAYBE &#8212; you could handle something the side of Mercedes-Benz USA. What on Earth makes you think they&#8217;re coming back to Calgary? Just because Critical Mass is here? Maybe you think that Calgary&#8217;s cheapness offers an advantage? Maybe if you set up shop in, say, Moncton, you might have a chance. Believe me when I say that not only is Calgary not as cheap as it once was, there is a time difference which plays to be more of an inconvenience than you might imagine.<br />
Now to really sound like a jerk &#8212; who the hell do you think you are? As far as I know, there is ONE major interactive agency in town: Critical Mass. I know this because I keep an eye on the competition. And if you&#8217;re in Calgary, you&#8217;re not competition to Critical Mass. When we compete against companies like Agency.com, Organic, Modem Media, Sapient, Tribal, OgilvieInteractive, R/GA, and beat them out for contracts like NASA, Hyatt Hotels, Morgan Stanley, and Albertsons, that says something. When AdWeek lists you at #20 on their list of Top 50 Agencies, that says something.<br />
We have Mercedes-Benz USA because we&#8217;re good. And they know us.<br />
Think that&#8217;s not an issue? Think you can still win them over? Try this on for size. Not too long ago, Critical Mass went head-to-head with the heavyweights in the industry for a USD$12+ million contract. We *almost* won. Want to know why we didn&#8217;t? Because it would have cost the client too much money to move away from the agency they had. It boiled down to the pain point. And if for that reason alone, you&#8217;re not going to get Mercedes-Benz USA unless your company appears in AdWeek&#8217;s top 50 list.<br />
So please, if you work for an agency in Calgary, cash a reality check and realize that there is just no feasible away you can steal away an account that large. The industry has matured in the last four years. Big companies need established agencies. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re still here. And that&#8217;s why we aren&#8217;t going anywhere, except up, that is. If you&#8217;re so hell-bent on working on the Mercedes-Benz account, I can offer you one piece of advice:<br />
Apply for a job. We&#8217;re hiring.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some weeks ago, my friend and co-worker Luke threw around an email looking for volunteers. They had to be passionate about movies, movie theatres, and be willing to be interviewed for CBC Radio.<br />
Hopefully, I don&#8217;t need to say what I did.<br />
About an hour later, my phone rang. It was an outside number, which is a bit of a rarity for me. It was the CBC, specifically a woman by the name of Judy, who was screening me to see if I would be appropriate for interviewing. We talked for a bit, and she decided that I was vocal enough to interview.<br />
Me? Vocal? Never&#8230;<br />
After a few aborted attempts to get together for the interview (despite the fact that Judy lives just down the street from me), we finally made arrangements for a lunchtime interview. Of course, this was during the annual Mercedes-Benz USA planning sessions for my account, which (as a manager) I participate in. We get about an hour for lunch. I almost missed meeting up with Judy.<br />
We drove down to Famous Players&#8217; Paramount Chinook, at Chinook Mall. This is one of the premiere theatres in town, and one of the most expensive. Getting out of the CBC van, Judy pulled out her Minidisc recorder, a microphone, and started the show. After a quick run outside, we ventured inside to finish off.<br />
I ranted. The problem is that over the phone, I had ranted much better. But with a microphone thrust in my face, it was a little harder to form coherent sentences. So some of it didn&#8217;t come out quite as well as I&#8217;d hoped. Ah well, such is the joy if being thrust into the limelight.<br />
The interview lasted about a half hour. At that point, Judy quickly raced around to interview a few more people quickly before taking me back to the office. I got back just in time to get into the afternoon planning session.<br />
Judy told me she&#8217;d let me know when it was going to air. Of course, like things always seem to end up, it was &#8220;on-again, off-again&#8221;. So we were in waiting mode&#8230;<br />
This morning, I arrived at work at my usual time, having done my usual Monday morning routine at the gym, read my usual run of comics, and went downstairs to have my usual breakfast (lately, eggs and ham &#8212; part of my diet). I ran into Amanda (our Project Director for Mercedes-Benz) as I entered the Bistro. She said: &#8220;I heard you on the radio this morning!&#8221;<br />
Unusual.<br />
Amanda wasn&#8217;t the only one. Several people heard it. Near as I figure, the radio show had been on about 7:45 this morning, catching people on the way into work. As I don&#8217;t walk to work with a radio, or listen to CBC at work, I had completely missed it.<br />
So I wrote Judy. She had been a bit surprised by the broadcast herself, but told me that it would be posted on CBC&#8217;s website by the end of the morning. Sure enough, true to her word, shortly before lunch there appeared a link entitled &#8220;Movie Madness&#8221;.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t my entire interview, and consisted of only two sections of it. The segment opens with my rant about this giant pharaoh&#8217;s head inside the theatre. Until a couple of months ago, it used to be part of a &#8220;show&#8221;, which included flamethrowers (no, I&#8217;m not kidding), lights, and &#8220;Egyptian&#8221; music. The &#8220;highlight&#8221; of this show was when the pharaoh&#8217;s head split open, and laser beams fired out into the cavernous lobby. I hate that thing.<br />
The second part was how I&#8217;d like to see ticket prices drop. You might remember part of that rant from another entry (see [[Movie Ticket Prices and Acts of Piracy]]). The segment then goes on to talk about how the smaller independant theatres will continue to succeed because of how they cater to their clientele.<br />
So if you want to listen to this story, <a href="http://calgary.cbc.ca/media/audio/ceo/20031201MOVIES_F.ram">just point your browser to the segment on CBC&#8217;s site</a>. It&#8217;s RealAudio. Not my favourite format in any way. Actually, I rather dislike it. Especially since Real Networks went to a pay-only player. What&#8217;s with that? If you don&#8217;t already have Real Player, <a href="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/netscape6/english/6.1/windows/win32/xpi/nsrp8.exe">you can download a free one</a>.<br />
So tune in, and find out how your tax dollars are being put to putting me over the Canadian airwaves again!</p>

		<p>A question: Who commits the greater act of piracy? Those who download movies off the Internet, or those who plunder the pocketbooks of the innocent who want to see the next blockbuster?<br />
I&#8217;ve been finding myself asking that question more and more lately. For those of you who haven&#8217;t been to a movie lately (or a movie in Canada at one of the major chains), you probably haven&#8217;t seen the ads being played before the trailers, pleading with the general public not to download movies off the Internet.<br />
They&#8217;re quite insulting, actually. They&#8217;re put out by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), although it&#8217;s not branded that way. It&#8217;s branded &#8220;Respect Copyrights&#8221; (http://www.respectcopyrights.org/), assumedly to draw attention away from the MPAA, which like the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), have been raising a serious stink about people downloading copyrighted material off the Internet.<br />
I&#8217;m all for copyrights! I wholeheartedly believe and subscribe to it! I&#8217;ll admit to a few MP3s that I don&#8217;t own outright, but I usually go out to buy the album if I like the music. (Otherwise, I delete it.) I believe in copyrights because it&#8217;s my only defence when some shmuck steals the code from my site (including my name!) to (apparently) improve search engine traffic to their porn site. Yeah, I don&#8217;t get that one, either.<br />
What I&#8217;m not for is watching these patronizing ads. The two I&#8217;ve seen feature movie industry workers, whom you&#8217;ve never heard of or would never know. One&#8217;s a set painter, the other a stunt driver. They both proclaim that piracy doesn&#8217;t hurt the big-wig producers, but them directly.<br />
No offence to them, but I fail to see how this is possible. Let&#8217;s look at reality, here. Movies will continue to be made (unless piracy gets to the point where movie companies go out of business), and movies will always &#8212; *always* &#8212; need people to make them. That means set painters and stunt drivers (okay, maybe not in *every* movie). You can&#8217;t have a movie without people doing the work.<br />
It&#8217;s the producers who get hit. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; the workers have already been paid for their toils. It&#8217;s the producers and the movie companies that get hit because the box office take is that much lower, and the DVD sales will be affected. (I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s half the reason for the rumours that &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions&#8221; will be out on DVD before the end of *this* year.) Nevermind the spiralling cost of making movies (for any number of a million reasons) or the escalating salaries of Hollywood stars &#8212; really, USD$20 million a movie? Who are you kidding?<br />
So piracy hits the movie makers where it hurts them most &#8212; their pocketbook. Do I agree with this? Heck, no &#8212; I want them to keep making movies. I love movies! I love going to movies! I love everything about movies! What I don&#8217;t like is the propagandist crap the movie makers are shoving down on us.<br />
Why are they doing it? Money, of course. They can&#8217;t stop people from downloading. Maybe they should stop the movies from getting on the Internet in the first place? Yeah, that would make sense, and the irony is that almost 80% of the movies available on the Internet are from &#8230; ready for this? &#8230; people in the movie industry (statistic compiled by AT&amp;T Labs). The movie biz is cannibalising itself. But who gets blamed? We do, of course.<br />
Why do people download? Money, of course. They don&#8217;t want to spend money to see bad movies. The quality of Hollywood films has been in decline over the years. In the last 10 years, there&#8217;s been a huge influx of degenerative garbage dressed as a movie. Little gems do get made, but there are far too many so-so (and much worse) films.<br />
Now combine the quality factor with the box office prices. Right now (in Calgary), it costs $13.95 to see a movie after 18:00 (except Tuesdays) at the premiere theatres in town (coincidentally, mostly owned by Famous Players). When we went to see &#8220;Matrix:Revolutions, The IMAX Experience&#8221;, it cost us $16.50. (And it wasn&#8217;t an IMAX print, probably just a 70mm.) Until that point, seeing a regular movie on the IMAX screen didn&#8217;t cost a cent more than on a regular screen. On 16 December, a few of us are going to see the &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; marathon &#8212; 12 hours of movies. (Yes, we&#8217;re sadistic.) Ticket price? $50. I had better get a &#8220;I surived 12 hours of Lord of the Rings and all I got was this lousy t-shirt&#8221; outta that price, otherwise I&#8217;ve forked out over $16.50 for each of the three movies.<br />
Hey Movie Industry! Wanna know why people download? Here&#8217;s a hint &#8212; $11 for a weekend matinee! Give me a freakin&#8217; break. I was ticked when regular movie prices were that much. Since when should a matinee cost a mere three bucks less than a regular movie? (Unless, of course, regular price is $7 or $8.) Where&#8217;s the incentive, eh? And don&#8217;t forget the extra $10 for the regular pop and regular popcorn. No wonder I sneak in M&amp;Ms.<br />
I was interviewed by CBC Radio Calgary (don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;ll ever air &#8212; I&#8217;ll keep you posted) about movies and the things that bug me about them. Without getting into too much detail, the big things were the whole &#8220;experience&#8221; (e.g. theatres with a lot of kvitch), high concession prices, and my single biggest favourite, high ticket prices.<br />
This is why I like to frequent the independant theatres. They get excellent movies, have *much* more reasonable prices, and don&#8217;t offer anything I don&#8217;t need or want. I also still frequent the &#8220;lesser&#8221; chain theatres, such as Cineplex&#8217;s Eau Claire theatre. It&#8217;s old, it&#8217;s not as nice as the others, but it&#8217;s a movie theatre &#8212; nothing more. (Yeah, there&#8217;s an arcade/bar tacked onto the side, but the theatre itself is just a theatre.)<br />
It seems pretty plain to me. Want to reduce piracy? Reduce the prices. This was something I learned in *grade* school. I don&#8217;t need any fancy MBA to tell you how it works. You can increase the number of patrons by lowering your prices. The trick is to find out when it&#8217;s maximized &#8212; something the major chains (for whatever reason) aren&#8217;t doing. They figure: raise the price, make more money!<br />
I decided after the last price hike that enough was enough. When prices hit (or more likely, exceed) $14, I&#8217;m not going to evening shows anymore. Matinees and Tuesdays only. One day, not at all. Why? A guy&#8217;s gotta have a line. These prices are unsustainable, and if the only way I can protest it is not to go, then so be it. I&#8217;ll wait for a rental.<br />
You want to talk piracy? Lemme show you the hole left in my wallet.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A lot of people give Calgary a hard time. They call it &#8220;Cowtown&#8221;. They think that we&#8217;re overrun with cowboys and horses. They think everyone has a shotgun rack in their beat-up pickup truck. They think that most of people who live here are intolerant hicks with nothing better to do than pick fights every night. They think it&#8217;s really cold year-round. They think there&#8217;s no culture.<br />
The problem is that people don&#8217;t think. They accept without question.<br />
These were stories I&#8217;d heard before moving here, so I too was guilty of not asking questions. I didn&#8217;t know much about Calgary before I first came here in September 1997. My first exposure to Calgary was an eye-opening one &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t expected such a young city. Both Gerry and I recognized that almost immediately, and how much we suddenly felt the urge to move here.<br />
As it stands, I moved to Vancouver and Gerry moved to Bermuda. But now I&#8217;m here, and in the last year I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit about this city. It&#8217;s time to dispell a few myths.<br />
Myth #1: Calgary is full of cowboys.<br />
There are two times this is actually true. First, during the Calgary Stampede. This is when the only way you can tell the city folk from cow pokes is by how clean and pressed the clothes are. The only other time this is true is when some of them gets lost, and somehow finds their way downtown. It&#8217;s rare, but it&#8217;s been known to happen from time to time. (For all we know, it could just be part of an ad campaign.)<br />
Oh, and then there&#8217;s patrons of Cowboys, Desperados, and Outlaws, three of the western-themed bars in town. But those are usually drunk jocks.<br />
Myth #2: Most people who live here are intolerant hicks.<br />
Most of the people who live in this city moved from other provinces (of all the people I&#8217;ve met here, only about 10 are native Calgarians). Many are from back east. We have the youngest demographic of any city in Canada &#8212; the average age is 33.7 (as of 1996, down from 34.5 in 1991), while the Canadian average was 35.8. Also, over 50% of our residents have a post-secondary education of some form.<br />
We also have a lot of rich people. It&#8217;s that black, oily stuff they keep finding out here. There are a large number of people who&#8217;ve made small (and large) fortunes off it. Of course, you can&#8217;t spot some of these people &#8212; they look completely ordinary. That is, until they climb into their Mercedes, BMWs, Porches (although they&#8217;re not as popular out here), high-end SUVs, and expensive Japanese imports.<br />
If there are hicks here, they&#8217;re keeping a mighty low profile.<br />
Myth #3: It&#8217;s cold year-round.<br />
No, it&#8217;s *dry* here year-round. Our altitude, combined with a lack of suitably large body of water (the Bow River certainly does not count) keeps us gulping liquids and using moisturizers more than most people. But there is an upside to all that &#8212; the driness cuts down on the cold. Without moisture to cut through our clothes, a heavy shirt, fleece, and windbreaker can get you though weather that freezes people to death back in southern Ontario.<br />
The downside, of course, is that when we go to more humid climates without suitable protection, we freeze even in what others consider comfortable weather.<br />
Sure we do have winter from as early as late October through to as late as early June (worst-case scenario), but we also get Chinooks all year (yes, we get Chinooks in the summer, too, but they&#8217;re not as pronounced as in the winter), so even in the dead of winter, when others are digging themselves out of 10 feet of snow, we could be wearing shorts on the skihills.<br />
Myth #4: There&#8217;s no culture; there&#8217;s nothing to do.<br />
This is the single largest myth, and it&#8217;s one that many transplanted Calgarians continue. Calgary isn&#8217;t like Vancouver, or Toronto, or Montreal. In those cities, you can&#8217;t avoid things to do &#8212; they&#8217;re in your face 24-7. But out here, people aren&#8217;t interested in that kind of constant bombardment. We have a large theatre scene &#8212; we have a complex here that I haven&#8217;t seen in either Toronto or Vancouver. We have a large concert hall, and several stadiums perfectly capable of holding concerts or sports, depending on your fancy.<br />
And then, of course, there&#8217;s the outdoors. I would love to know what the population of the city drops to during the summer, when almost everyone ducks out for the wilderness. You can&#8217;t get a camping spot in this province on any long weekend &#8230; not without either booking months (and I mean *months*) in advance, or staking out a spot (in the non-reservable grounds) days ahead.<br />
Okay, still not impressed? I left this one for last, because even I have trouble believing it. Calgary has a skatepark, called the Shaw Millennium Skatepark. This is a concrete playground built specifically for the skateboarding population of our city &#8212; a place where they can go and grind to their heart&#8217;s content, without any fear that some security guard will interrupt their fun.<br />
This park was built by the city (with funds from local companies, such as Shaw Cable), is open 24 hours a day, and completely free. Chris, Stuart, and I went over to it on Saturday night to get a close look and see what it was all about. It&#8217;s quite large, and well-built (at least from a skateboarder&#8217;s perspective). It allows kids to do whatever they want, and hang out with people like themselves. And even at midnight, there are kids of all ages practicing, showing off, and hanging out.<br />
It&#8217;s just west of the downtown core, wedged between 6th and 9th Avenues, far enough away from condos to not bother residents, but close enough so the kids can still get there. I can&#8217;t think of another city that has something similar in its downtown. Stuart was quick to point out that Toronto would find some way to turn it into a golf course. Vancouver would build a condo, and then charge $150,000 for a 400 square foot bachelor.<br />
I hope that in some small way, I might have changed your view of Calgary. Although different from other large cities in Canada, it&#8217;s no less a fine place to live. I offer anyone the chance to come here and see for yourself.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<blockquote><p><em>Blepharospasm (n.)</em>:<br />
The repetitive contraction of eyelid muscles in a rhythmic fashion. In some instances, the eyelid may repeatedly close or attempt to close. The most common causes of muscle twitching in the eyelid are fatigue or stress.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is how I managed to notice that I&#8217;ve been at Critical Mass for a year and a day. Well, not so much the blepharospasm as it was the stress that keeping bringing it back.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;ve been here a year. I&#8217;ll forego with torturing you with the recap (you can stop cheering now), but suffice to say it&#8217;s been quite the year. Made a lot of new friends, and missed a lot of old ones. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of the rise of Critical Mass &#8230; and I&#8217;m really hoping that I never need to experience the fall. With luck, our management will keep us in check and we&#8217;ll just keep on sailing.<br />
Hmm. I guess &#8220;surfing&#8221; would be a more appropriate word.<br />
So back that that stress and fatigue thing&#8230; This was something I really hoped to avoid this year, but that was one New Year&#8217;s resolution that got shot down in short order. Too much dedication to my job, I guess. Either that or obsession. Not sure which. (Some argue one way, some the other.)<br />
Been working like a dog again (woof, woof). (Has anyone actually seen a dog work? All the ones I ever saw just laid around all day. What I wouldn&#8217;t give to be a dog for a couple days right now.) I keep forgetting that the more senior you get, the more work seems to migrate in your direction. And while I try to pawn as much of it off to others as I can, there are a handful of projects that (for now) only I can do. Blech.<br />
I just hope this doesn&#8217;t get any worse. People get insomnia from this kind of thing. I don&#8217;t get enough sleep as it is without being able to catch a few Zs. Next thing you know, I&#8217;ll be fighting myself in parking lots, being two people, and planning to blow up credit card companies.<br />
But I&#8217;m not my freaking khakis just yet&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate monopolies. They generally treat the customer like so much belly button lint.<br />
Late last month, Allison and I decided to get Roger&#8217;s @ Home (aka &#8220;Wave&#8221;). For those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of it, better crawl out from under the bed &#8212; you&#8217;ve been down there too long. It&#8217;s Internet access through your television cable. It&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s always on, and it&#8217;s twice the price of dial-up.<br />
The reason we wanted to get the Wave was because Allison had decided to go freelance, and needed a way to do research, but not tie up the phone line with the access. Having the ability to download anything at any time was also a major benefit.<br />
Roger&#8217;s had a deal on where you could get your installation free if you called by May 31st. Allison called on that day (she was purchasing it, under the guise of expensing it later) and arranged for installation on June 14th at 11:00am. Fine. No problem.<br />
We&#8217;ll skip ahead a couple of weeks, mostly because there&#8217;s not really much else to fill the gap (and it would make this message really long).<br />
Roger&#8217;s calls me on my cell phone. (We have the cell phone number listed on our voice mail message at home, so it&#8217;s always fairly easy to contact us.) They wanted to change the install time from 11:00am to 9:00am. Although Allison would be at home for the technicians to show up, I figured it would be two hours she wouldn&#8217;t have to waste waiting.<br />
If we only knew&#8230;<br />
Monday morning. I&#8217;m running a tad late. Just as I head out the door, the phone rings. It&#8217;s the technician. He&#8217;s running a little late, but will arrive in 15 minutes. No problem &#8212; it&#8217;s not too bad.<br />
At this point, I defer to Allison&#8217;s narrative on the events. (If I make a mistake, a correction will follow shortly.)<br />
At roughly 9:05, Allison receives a phone call from some guy confirming a Wave installation for 11:30. Allison is understandably confused &#8212; it was supposed to be five minutes ago, not 11:30 &#8230; even then, it was originally 11:00. The technician gave her the brush off, saying he couldn&#8217;t make it before 11:30. Allison made him promise, hope to die, poke a needle in his eye that he&#8217;d be there for 11:30. He said: No problem.<br />
At 9:15, a guy shows up at the apartment door (note: he did not buzz into the building), and asked for &#8220;Allison&#8221; <!--(note: not "ann-DRAY-ah", but "ANN-dree-ah")-->. He didn&#8217;t identify himself for some time. Finally, Allison took the risk, opened the door, and only then did the twit say he was there to install the Wave.<br />
I&#8217;m telling you: Belly button lint.<br />
He pulls out a box containing the cable modem (pulls the Internet signals from the TV signals), a cable splitter, and about 90 feet of cable (the cable outlet is on the opposite side of the living room). He plugs in the cable splitter, runs the cable, plugs in the modem, waits for some lights to blink, and leaves.<br />
15 minutes work.<br />
I&#8217;m in the wrong job&#8230;<br />
So you&#8217;re probably wondering at this point &#8212; what the heck was he there for, anyway? Well, Roger&#8217;s has this really inane system of installation: They send a cable technician to install the cable, and get it ready for the PC technician, who comes later.<br />
That&#8217;s who Allison now had to wait for. This shining example of the human race called at 11:26 (just four minutes before he was to appear) to inform Allison that he wasn&#8217;t going to make it. Needless to say, she was turning an interesting shade of very-pissed-off.<br />
This guy made no apologies about not showing up, about the fact that he had sworn up and down that he&#8217;d be there for 11:30, and that Allison had just wasted two hours of her time. He suggested that *we* reschedule.<br />
Um, no.<br />
After firing off a message to Roger&#8217;s (which was half-written shortly after the cable technician left), Allison went to work. We figured that we&#8217;d actually hear from Roger&#8217;s in a short period of time.<br />
Yeah, I know, we&#8217;re living in the wrong universe.<br />
By Wednesday, we still hadn&#8217;t heard from them. By this time, my resolve was fading, and I was ready to bust a few heads. I called up their customer service department, and calmly explained that their idea of customer service was something akin to going to a restaurant and having to catch, clean, and cook your Catch-of-the-Day.<br />
I was told that I would be called back in &#8220;about 30 minutes&#8221;.<br />
The following morning, I made it painfully clear to Roger&#8217;s that I was not pleased. I was ready to cancel my cable outright. The poor guy who took my call was *very* apologetic, and then put me on hold for 45 minutes.<br />
[Ed. Note: Now that it&#8217;s a week later, this fiasco is getting kinda funny.]<br />
Here&#8217;s where it gets really stupid. I end up talking to the twit I&#8217;d talked to the day before. I choose not to mention that he&#8217;d told me that &#8220;at the very least&#8221;, he was supposed to call me back in &#8220;about 30 minutes&#8221;. Instead, he asks me if I&#8217;m at home. I say &#8220;no&#8221;, I&#8217;m at work. He asks me when I&#8217;ll be at home. I say &#8220;when I&#8217;m done, usually around 5:30-6:00pm PDT&#8221;. He says &#8220;Oh&#8221;.<br />
Oh. As in, &#8220;Oh boy, this guy&#8217;s about to kill me when I tell him we have to reschedule some time next century.&#8221;<br />
Luckily, Allison (who had only just started freelancing) *was* at home. I made mention of it. I was told that &#8220;she would be contacted today&#8221;. I quickly called Allison to confirm with her. She said it was &#8220;okay&#8221;. (Sorry, I&#8217;m getting a little &#8220;quote-happy&#8221;.) This was around 1:00pm or so. No-one called Allison until 5:30 or so.<br />
Yeah, really snappy service.<br />
At any rate, I come waltzing in around 6:30pm, with the PC tech practically on my heels. He then spends the next hour and a half tearing his fingers open on our computer (I&#8217;ve lost many a limb in that monstrosity). Several bandages and some swearing later, he&#8217;s got the thing responding to the modem, and we can surf the &#8216;net a lot faster than before.<br />
As we talked with the technician, he explained that Roger&#8217;s had literally just dumped SHL Systemhouse as their PC technicians, and picked up Microage. The transition hadn&#8217;t been really smooth. On Monday alone, they were to do 120 installs. There were only 19 successful ones.<br />
Guess who wasn&#8217;t one of them.<br />
In the end, things worked out *reasonably* well. We got the installation for free (a smart move on their part), and we got three free months of use (although that was part of the deal from the beginning anyway &#8212; either free installation or free usage). Aside from all the run-around, everything seems to be okay.<br />
At least for now&#8230; [Insert ominous-sounding music here.]</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is an auspicious date for me &#8212; one year ago today, I started my new job, working for a company that makes video games. A year later, I&#8217;m still here, despite the difficulties Radical went through in October and the layoffs that followed. Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that things have turned out they way they have.<br />
Speaking of new jobs, Allison has a new job as well. After countless (and some very strange) interviews, she started last Wednesday (10 February 1999) with InterLogic Engineering in Surrey as the Corporate Presence Guru. Okay, that&#8217;s not her *official* title, but I think that would be a good one.<br />
It was on her start day that I really began to hate snow. At least in Vancouver, that is. Well, actually, Vancouver itself isn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; it&#8217;s Burnaby, New Westminster, and Surrey I hate.<br />
Here&#8217;s what happened. It seems our old friend Murphy noticed that Allison was to start a new job, and Heaven forbid that she have an easy time of it. So he made it snow. A lot. We woke up that morning to a few inches of snow. That in itself wouldn&#8217;t be so bad &#8212; except that no-one here knows what to do with it. (And it doesn&#8217;t help that there&#8217;s no-one here who knows how to remove it.)<br />
Allison doesn&#8217;t like driving in the snow here, especially in her car (it&#8217;s a small Toyota). Considering all the morons in SUVs (sports utility vehicles) out here, it&#8217;s not unusual not to want to drive. Being the gentleman that I am (okay, you can all stop snickering now!), I offered to drive her to work.<br />
Normally, the trip is about 30 minutes. We left at about 7:40 so Allison could be at work for 8:30 (that her start time). By 8:00, we were just beginning to inch our way over the bridge into Surrey &#8230; and saw the line of 10,000 cars trying to climb a teeny-tiny little hill. Of course, the hill was covered in a nice sheet of ice.<br />
Realising that we weren&#8217;t going to get anywhere fast, I whipped out my trust map of the Lower Mainland, found a detour, and promptly ended up looking at another hill. Allison had always complained of how &#8220;flat&#8221; Surrey was &#8212; I was, not surprisingly, annoyed when she told me that there were hills in Surrey. The hills never seem to count when it&#8217;s dry and free of snow&#8230;<br />
Anyway, I turned around to go back to the 10,000 car pileup, and accidentally turned down the wrong road. This turned out to be a very fortuitous accident &#8212; it led us up a nice, relatively clear road, and got us around the lineups.<br />
Just after 9:15, we pulled into InterLogic&#8217;s parking lot, and Allison quickly headed inside. It was now my turn to go to work, and there was no way I was going to drive there. I left my car in the parking lot, hopped a taxi, and caught the SkyTrain. An hour later, I pulled into work.<br />
Again, I repeat &#8212; it sucks when it snows here.<br />
On the weekend, we travelled over to the Island to visit with family, most notably for Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s birthday. He turned the fresh young age of 80, and seemed quite happy to see his family all around him.<br />
For the event, we went to The Grotto, a restaurant that was noted for great food. This much was true &#8212; the food was pretty decent. The management, however, was the worst I have ever had the displeasure to experience. They didn&#8217;t seem to understand the concept of &#8220;customer satisfaction&#8221;.<br />
Allison&#8217;s aunt made a reservation at the restaurant a month or so in advance (it was, after all, the day before Valentine&#8217;s). She wanted to make sure that we would have seating for all 14 of us. Funny how they didn&#8217;t have 14 menus set aside&#8230;<br />
That was the first problem. It took 20 minutes to round up 14 menus. But it got worse. It took 30 minutes to get six appetizers. Six. Not 14, six. Something doesn&#8217;t add up there. Letting that slide, we had to wait another 30 minutes for our meals, and even then &#8212; we only got half of them. Moreover, the guest of honour (Grandpa Vailmont) was served last! Even a special order we had placed a day earlier (steamed vegetables for Grandma Vailmont) when unfulfilled. It took another 10 minutes to receive the last of the meals.<br />
Needless to say, there were several of us who were ticked off. Allison and I made a point of talking to the manager. The manager tried to claim that there were &#8220;too busy&#8221;, and deferred to whom we assume is her daughter (or possibly her granddaughter). Neither of them would apologise for the screw-ups, and in fact tried to blame the whole thing on us! How dare we bring so many people to their restaurant!<br />
Ten minutes later, Allison and I walked out with a $40 gift certificate, and a promise that we&#8217;d never go back &#8212; we never even got an apology. We didn&#8217;t want the gift certificate &#8212; we wanted to hear: &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry&#8221;.<br />
At lunch today, I met with my cousins, Pam and Darren. Darren works here in Vancouver, but tends to travel from Peru to the Arctic on a semi-regular basis (ah, the joys of being a globetrotting geologist). Pam works for Petro-Canada in Calgary, but had come out for a visit. We spent a rather long (and very pleasant) lunch at the Yaletown Brewery.<br />
That&#8217;s about all there is from this neck of the woods for now. The rain has stopped, but the winds are still blowing. (Lousy La Nina!) Hopefully spring will start soon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The fallout from the round of layoffs a week and a half ago came to a rather disappointing end &#8212; one of our lead programmers decided he didn&#8217;t want to work for corporate America, and quit. Just as the game he was working on entered the final development stages. I still can&#8217;t believe that the Powers That Be could not see that coming. I suspect that Rory and Ian (the two driving forces of the company) predicted something like this would happen, but the final decision came from the States. Convenient that they don&#8217;t really have anything to do with this office.<br />
Then Marketting (also located in San Francisco) decided to get into the act. Earlier in the week, a couple of press releases got around about the deal Radical has with ESPN (we&#8217;re making video games for them). One of our investors, who writes a column for BC Technology, decided he&#8217;d start spewing out to the entire planet about the neat things we were doing.<br />
Problem: No-one was supposed to know until today.<br />
So Marketting decided they&#8217;d send around a message that pointed us at a rather heavily made-up internal website that warned employees about talking to the press. (They didn&#8217;t mention a thing about boneheaded investors.) That was mildy degrading. Two days later, we received the hard copies. Four-colour print on expensive-feeling paper. One copy for each person. Nice waste of money, especially so close to layoffs, eh?<br />
It turns out that the flyers were approved and printed before the financial crunch, but I still think that the idea to hand them around was extremely poor. Many people in San Francisco wonder if all of Vancouver hates them. I can safely say we don&#8217;t hate all of them &#8230; just selected people.<br />
Onto different things&#8230;<br />
I got out this weekend. I had originally decided to go out and get a haircut. I haven&#8217;t had a haircut in about three months, so it&#8217;s looking a little scraggly. (I don&#8217;t buy into the ol&#8217; &#8220;haircut every four weeks&#8221; baloney &#8212; that&#8217;s a ploy by the hairdressers of the world to make more money. Same applies for showering daily, which is really only needed unless you&#8217;re dirty or you smell bad.)<br />
Didn&#8217;t make it that far. Allison immediately suggested that we could go to White Rock. Having read a little about it, and not having been there yet, I thought it a good idea. So we hopped in my car, and took off in the general direction of the former resort town.<br />
Finding it was another issue. Although I knew approximately where White Rock was, I had no idea exactly how to get there. Neither did Allison, although she had a much better idea of where it was. We drove across the Knight St. bridge, and drove through Richmond. We eventually found ourselves in Delta, trying to find out way into Surrey. (White Rock is at the south end of Surrey.) Once we entered Surrey, I decided that it would be a good idea to get a roadmap. (Hey, I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who drives aimlessly for hours without asking where I&#8217;m going.)<br />
About 45 minutes or so after leaving home, we found the main drag in White Rock. We drove along for a short distance, and pulled into a parking lot at the side of the road. You could tell we were in a tourist trap &#8212; the parking cost a dollar an hour.<br />
We crossed the railway tracks (Burlington Northern runs a line between White Rock&#8217;s building and beach, a left-over from the heady days of being a resort town, I suspect) and walked towards the wharf, about a kilometre away. (We could have parked closer to the wharf, but we didn&#8217;t know exactly where we were.)<br />
Along the way, we ran into the White Rock, from which the town received its name. It&#8217;s a large boulder of white granite, an erratic left over from the days of the glaciers. Since White Rock was founded, the boulder has received a few coats of white paint, usually from the local graduates.<br />
The wharf (pier, boardwalk, whatever you want to call it) extends into Shemiamoo Bay about a half kilometre or so. At the end are a lot of people fishing, but mostly crabbing (throwing in crab cages and attempting to catch dinner).<br />
We wandered back through the town for a while, before I darted back to retrieve the car. (The parking meter was running low, and Allison&#8217;s new shoes weren&#8217;t exactly co-operating with her feet.) When I returned, I was met with a freight train that rolled along the tracks, (presumably) heading towards Vancouver.<br />
We stopped for a quick snack at an ice cream shop, and took a moment to relax somewhat (we had walked quite a while that morning). Having had our fill of White Rock (it doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; White Rock&#8217;s is quite small), we opted to travel further west along the shore.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Point Roberts. If you follow the western shoreline of Delta south, you pass by Tsawwassen, a major ferry terminal, just before you reach the 49th Parallel, and the end of Canada. But right at that point isn&#8217;t the end of the land &#8212; it actually goes just a bit further south, and into the United States.<br />
In 1854, after many years of arguments between the United States and Britain (who held domain on the western side of the Dominion of Canada), the border was extended across the 49th Parallel until it reached the Georgia Strait, where it dipped slightly to accomodate Fort Victoria, at the south end of Vancouver Island. Originally, the Americans had wanted the border to allow them access right up the coast to Alaska (then-President Polk was elected on the slogan &#8220;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&#8221;), but eventually the Americans and the British agreed on the treaty of 1827, setting the border at the 49th Parallel. Because Point Roberts wasn&#8217;t on the oceans, it became cut off from Canada.<br />
But you&#8217;d never know. Pretty much the entire 4.9 square mile peninsula caters to Canadian interests. There are many beach homes (which sell for as little as US$50,000), and the area is almost completely undeveloped. But most amenities are available, and some of the municipal services (water, hospital) come from neighbouring Canada. The grocery stores take Canadian money with no question. And due to the relative tight security (you have to go through a border crossing when entering and exiting Point Roberts), the crime rate is also very low.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long. Just enough to buy some cheap cheese, and fill up on cheap American gas. We thought we might even stay for dinner, but Point Roberts isn&#8217;t exactly known for its good food. We headed home, but ended up in Richmond to eat at Antonio&#8217;s, a tasty pasta bar.<br />
On Sunday, Allison and I made a quick spin of Metrotown, so we could obtain some free shorts, and peruse the haircutting establishments (none of which I was at all thrilled with). I then pretty much resigned myself to cleaning up my apartment. Having acquired some furniture from IKEA earlier in the week, I was determined to try and clean up my apartment a little.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this is my first crack at a proper Branch entry. Hopefully these will go as well as I hope they do&#8230;<br />
My weekend got off to a bit of a rocky start &#8212; my company laid off 12 people in our Vancouver office. The CEO and CFO of our company (both from our San Francisco office) came up to inform us of the situation. The two driving forces of the company, Ian and Rory (the guys, who IMHO are the men behind the curtain) broke the bad news, and the CEO and CFO put the spin on it.<br />
Now I know why I didn&#8217;t like working for Corporate America &#8212; the spin. I hate spin. I like hard, cold, unsugared facts. I have to give Rory and Ian their credit &#8212; they know their staff well. The CEO on the other hand, well, he needs to be here a little more often to understand us, I guess. All I know is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought his presentation was a little too slick.<br />
On Friday, Allison and I decided we&#8217;d head to Nanaimo for the long weekend. Allison had not been home since our last excursion at Easter, and wanted to go home for a short while. I, too, wanted to go, because it would allow me to get out of the city for a brief period of time. (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says &#8212; a change of scenery is a must from time to time.<br />
Allison picked me up at the office just after 12:00 on Friday afternoon. Our first destination was Granville Island, so we could visit the market. Our plan was to bring over all the goodies needed to have a good west coast barbecue.<br />
Following a brief lunch, we looked around at the various shops. We purchased vegetables (asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), fruit (strawberries), bread (sourdough), salmon steaks wild sockeye), and a bottle of a not-too-dry white wine. The whole shebang came out to around $40. (The salmon and wine accounted for most of the cost.)<br />
By the time we left, we found we would be hard-pressed to get to the ferry at Tsawassen in time. So we opted for the Horseshoe Bay ferry. One minor problem: We weren&#8217;t the only ones with that idea.<br />
By the time we got to Burrard, the street was backed up. It took over 10 minutes to crawl a few measly blocks. Georgia was even worse &#8212; traffic was solid for several blocks. But when we finally cleared the entrance to Stanley Park, the flow began to speed up. However, it was already 14:10, and we had to be at the ferry no later than 14:40 &#8230; if we were lucky enough to find parking.<br />
We had not been able to beat the rush to the long weekend, which was clearly evident by the very long lineup for the ferry. It looked like a three or four sailing wait for some people. Since Allison and I were aiming to be walk-ons, we were able to scoot down into Horseshoe Bay to look for a parking lot. Luck shone on us that day &#8212; we got one of the last spots.<br />
Despite some communication problems, we managed to contact Allison&#8217;s parents. They picked us up at the ferry, and we went to the Collins&#8217; for dinner. Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t started to make dinner yet. It was barbecue night.<br />
The next day, Allison and I thought we&#8217;d do some driving. Mrs. Collins suggested Cathedral Grove, which is a rather famous patch of old-growth forest near the very middle of the Island. Mr. Collins thought Coombs would be a nice stop along the way. Mrs. Collins then started to tell Allison about the new interchanges in the area &#8230; then promptly decided that the four of us should go on the trip. I had no objections.<br />
We stopped along the way at Rathtrevor beach, so I could see what a good tidal beach looked like. I don&#8217;t know how far out that beach went, but it looked like a half-kilometre. At high tide, the beach would completely vanish. All I could think was that the beach would be immense fun in the summer.<br />
We proceeded north to Parksville, where we turned onto the Port Alberni Highway, and headed west. Not too far from Parksville, we entered Coombs, a little town in the Island interior. Coombs probably used to be nothing more than a mining or logging town. Today it has a thriving little tourist business, formed around the Coombs market. What&#8217;s so special about the market? It&#8217;s not every day you see a sod roof with real goats parading about.<br />
Soon we entered Cathedral Grove. It&#8217;s a provincial park that was created from land donated by H.R. MacMillian, a forester who founded HR MacMillian (part of MacMillian-Blodel industries, if I&#8217;m not mistaken). Yes, Her-mac (as one call it) is a logging company. Sounds a little weird for a founder of a company that has come under a lot of fire for logging old growth-trees to donate a small forest of old-growth trees for parkland, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, Mr. MacMillan was apparently a nice guy, and wanted the future to know what the past looked like. Public outcry also forwarded the cause.<br />
Cathedral Grove is aptly named &#8212; I have never in my life seen trees so large. But even trees so large are not immune to the environment. On Jan. 1, 1997, there was a tremendous windstorm that tore through the grove. It knocked over several trees and thousands of branches. Several parts of the forest floor were complete littered with timber. But none of it was cleaned out &#8212; the park is to remain almost completely untouched.<br />
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Coombs, to shop at the market, and look around. It&#8217;s a nice little market &#8230; with a few hundred people packed in. But it&#8217;s worth the drive &#8230; at least, I thought it was worth the drive.<br />
We had a late lunch in the restaurant, and wandered through the multitude of wares in the market. (Oddly enough, most of the wares were Mexican &#8230; a little strange, IMHO, considering the Native influences in BC.) I purchased two very large Mexican hand-woven blankets (which are really warm). Allison bought a handful of paper mache vegetables for decoration.<br />
Returning home, we sat down to the task of making dinner. But even then, we didn&#8217;t eat until 20:00 or so. I offered to try and fix Mrs. Collins&#8217; email problems on her computer. She&#8217;d been having problems with the addressbook, and having multiple copies of Netscape floating around.<br />
The next day we rose early to go see the Victoria Day Parade. The Victoria Day Parade is a big thing out here. Few places in Ontario (only Ottawa comes to mind, and apparently Orillia also carries on the tradition) have a formal parade. In Ontario, the Victoria Day Weekend is more commonly known as the &#8220;May Two-Four&#8221; (the weekend was traditionally around May 24th, and a case of 24 beers is known as a &#8220;two-four&#8221;). It&#8217;s essentially the start of the cottage season in Ontario.<br />
We arrived downtown at about 10:40, expecting the parade to start at 11:00 (which was what we were led to believe). However, we noticed that there were still a lot of cars on the parade route, not all the reviewing stands had been completed, and we were the only people standing around. Mr. Collins soon found out that we had come too early &#8212; the parade didn&#8217;t start until 13:00.<br />
So we went wandering down on the waterfront. It was a nice day, albeit a little chilly from the wind. The weekend had brought a small amusement park to the waterfront (where just attractions appear during festive weekends). We had a batch of less-than-satisfactory french fries (they left a horrible taste in my mouth, and neither Allison or I were feeling too good as a result).<br />
At about 12:45, we headed back to the road to see the parade. When we arrived, the crowds that I had been expecting had appeared. Just after 13:00, the first sign of the parade went by &#8212; a fire truck. I had forgotten what community parades were like. It had been so long since my last one.<br />
I found out after the weekend that one of my co-workers, Greg Mayer, had been on the Hungarian Cultural float (it won for best Cultural Presentation, and Best Presentation Overall). We had somehow managed not to see each other.<br />
We had to hurry back to the Collins&#8217; to go to a family barbecue with Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents. We were sidetracked temporarily at home. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and had to lie down for a while before continuing out again.<br />
The barbecue was great &#8212; Mrs. Collins had made a potato salad that was exactly like the one my mother makes. It was like being at home. We ate until there was no food left to eat, and then ate some more. Dessert was a berry mix on a sponge cake, with whipped cream. Very tasty. Mostly considering that until this weekend, I didn&#8217;t eat berries. Things just keep changing&#8230;<br />
After dinner, we went inside where Allison and I watched the last episode of Murphy Brown. It was sad to see such a good show go, but it was a good last episode. Between Murphy Brown and the X-Files (which came on later), we went into the kitchen to make &#8220;stamps&#8221;. These were pieces of paper that you stamped with ink, and then sprinkled a special glitter overtop. Using a heater, you melted the glitter to make the stamp. It was fun. I won a prize.<br />
Then the final episode of the X-Files came on. Well, the final one that was filmed in Vancouver, anyway. (For we Canucks, it might as well be the final one.) I felt bad because I pretty much had the entire family in the living room watching a show that really didn&#8217;t seem to appeal to anyone. It was only a plot-builder for the movie being released this summer.<br />
Following the movie, the Collins and I made a hasty retreat back to the waterfront to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, we were late in arriving, and the fireworks had already started. As a result, we didn&#8217;t get out of the car. On the bright side though, we managed to be the first car out of there, and missed all the traffic. I felt bad again for making everyone miss the start of the fireworks.<br />
I tried to amend for my selfishness by buying coffee (and hot chocolate) and donuts (and muffins) for the Collins on our way back home.<br />
The next day, the weather couldn&#8217;t make up its mind. It was either rainy or somewhat sunny &#8212; there was no comfortable medium. We left late in the afternoon, catching the 16:30 ferry from Departure Bay. For those of you who know the ferry schedule, yes, that is not a standard ferry time. Extra ferries were running to cope with the traffic.</p>
