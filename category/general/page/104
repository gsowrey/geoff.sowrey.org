	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yeah, I know, the holidays are over, why the heck am I writing about it now? Simple: I got away from computers for two weeks, and haven&#8217;t had the time to write until now.<br />
Unlike last year, I spent roughly half my time here in Calgary, and the other half in Toronto. Why didn&#8217;t I just make up my mind and do one or the other? Well, I suppose I could have, but the cost of flying to Toronto for the entire time was pretty steep (go figure), and I did want to go home for a while. But because every time I go back to Ontario, I remember why I live here, I didn&#8217;t want to stick around too long.<br />
No, I don&#8217;t hate my family or friends. I don&#8217;t know what it is. I just feel &#8230; weird whenever I&#8217;m in southern Ontario. Maybe it&#8217;s the never-ending city that gets to me, I dunno.<br />
At any rate, I made the trip to Toronto *very* early on the 23rd. Originally, I was supposed to leave at 6:30 on the morning of the 23rd. However, Air Canada Tango cancelled that flight and bumped me back to 12:53am. Oh yay. How I love red-eye flights.<br />
Yes, I flew Tango. First off, it&#8217;s meant to be a low-budget airline killer. (Canada 3000&#8217;s already gone under, I suspect Air Transat might have trouble in the near future, but the real fight will come when Tango tries to dive into WestJet country.) As such, it&#8217;s as no-frills as it gets. Even the chairs show it &#8212; they&#8217;re grey, and don&#8217;t even have those fancy flaps of fabric on the headrests. Even the ubiquitous peanuts (now pretzels) cost $1.<br />
And boy, are the staff surly at one in the morning! I was amazed at the curtness of the flight attendants. Just because you got stuck with a bad shift doesn&#8217;t mean you take it out on the passengers. Welcome to the travel industry, crap happens! And the Head Flight Attendant must&#8217;ve smuggled her bong onboard &#8230; the number of times she stopped talking in mid-sentence for upwards of 30 seconds before resuming was astounding.<br />
Luckily, I slept the whole flight.<br />
Arriving at 6:30am EST was a joy. I hate Pearson International enough as it is &#8212; the parking is insane, the baggage system has to be the slowest in Canada (even despite the size), and usually by the time I get there I just want to get out of the airport, so I&#8217;m generally cranky anyway. Cathy was going insane trying to figure out where I was &#8212; the flight was a little late, and bags took nearly 30 minutes to come out &#8212; but finally we were off to Oakville.<br />
Neither of my parents knew I was coming in so early. They were expecting noon. However, in the interests of their sanity, I hadn&#8217;t mentioned that my flight had been rescheduled. (Next time, though, I&#8217;m not telling anyone the flight time, and I&#8217;m taking a cab.) While waiting for mom and dad to rise, I started making breakfast.<br />
And nearly burned the potatoes. Not my best outing, unfortunately.<br />
The 23rd was generally slow day. A little bit of running around, some decorating (the tree was not yet ready), and lots of chatting. The only thing that would have made it better was if it had snowed.<br />
On the 24th, we had lunch with my aunt (my father&#8217;s sister) and cousins Erica and Lauren. I hadn&#8217;t seen either of them in quite a while, and we had a ball listening to Erica&#8217;s traditional Christmas banter. Sometimes I swear Erica should be a comedienne, or at least give amateur mike night a shot &#8212; she&#8217;s certainly got the wit for it.<br />
Christmas Eve was the traditional roast ham and scalloped potatoes. For me, Christmas eve just isn&#8217;t right without them. It was also a late night for us &#8212; Craig, dad, and I were all up until almost 2:00 Christmas morning. It was going to be the start of a very long day.<br />
Christmas morning started a little early, around 9:00 or so. Coffee and Baileys (for those who drank it, I still avoid coffee) were the order of the moment. Given the hullabaloo to take place that evening, it was probably best that most of the family started to tranquilize early in the day. (Coffee and Baileys would give way to Caesars later in the morning.)<br />
Before breakfast, we gathered in the living room to open presents. In yet another tradition that seemed to have no specific beginning, I played Santa, and handed out presents around the room. It was interesting to watch people open presents when I had none. Being out-of-province, I was fortunate in not receiving much of anything (which believe it or not, I&#8217;m quite happy about).<br />
All in all, I received three gifts. The first was my grandfather&#8217;s pocket watch. I never met either of my biological grandfathers (I did have a maternal step-grandfather for many years) &#8212; they both died before I was born. My paternal grandfather died when my father was 18, and it was his watch I received. It&#8217;s a grand old piece, which my grandfather received from his parents when he was 21. We found this out by accident, when I unscrewed the back plate to find an inscription my father didn&#8217;t know was there.<br />
My second gift was a snowboard. Apparently someone had been listening a little to close to my interest in TRYING snowboarding. (I have to emphasis &#8220;trying&#8221; because someone equated it with &#8220;wanting to take up&#8221; instead of &#8220;seeing if it won&#8217;t kill me first&#8221;.) So, yes, sometime soon you can expect a lovely little tale about me breaking my tail trying to get down a mountain.<br />
The third was probably the most special of all: I got a brother-in-law-to-be.<br />
Cathy and Craig have been together for about five years (I don&#8217;t know exactly how long). They&#8217;re about as perfect a couple as you can have &#8212; after five years, they still sound like they&#8217;ve only been dating for a week. (It&#8217;s actually sickening sometimes.) Cathy has been after Craig for marriage for about a year, after Julie (an old family friend, and Cathy&#8217;s best friend) got hitched in December 2000. Craig waited until the right moment.<br />
As I handed out gifts, I picked up three identically-wrapped, but different-sized, boxes. One was obviously a ring case, one was about the size of a large brick, the largest the size of a shoe box. None were labelled, but Craig indicated they were for Cathy.<br />
My sister lunged at the ring box. Instead of a ring, however, she found a note that read: &#8220;Birks was sold out of everything, and all I could get was this box.&#8221;<br />
Cathy, fortunately, has a very good sense of humour.<br />
She opened the largest one next. Under the wrapping paper was, in fact, a shoebox, upon which Craig wrote &#8220;This is not a sweatshirt, this is a remote control&#8221;. (The running joke the night before was that Craig was getting Cathy a remote control for Christmas.) Inside was a sweatshirt.<br />
On to present #3. This was an electric toothbrush, something Cathy wanted for a while, so I gathered. But wedged inside the styrofoam packing was a slender silver ring. I don&#8217;t think I even heard Cathy say &#8220;yes&#8221;.<br />
A note on that ring, by the way. It&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s mother&#8217;s original engagement ring &#8230; with a couple modifications. (After my grandfather died, someone (we don&#8217;t know who) turned the ring into a dinner ring.) But with a resetting, the ring will be Cathy&#8217;s.<br />
Following our rather emotional moments by the fire, we ate breakfast (my father&#8217;s secret recipe for pancakes) and started to prepare for dinner. We were having a lot of people over, and it was going to take a while to get all the food ready. It was going to be a dinner to remember.<br />
I honestly don&#8217;t remember the last time the entire Robinson family had come to my family&#8217;s home for Christmas dinner, but I&#8217;m willing to take a bet on about five years. It&#8217;s certainly been at least that long since we were all together at the same time, only now both Mark and Julie are both married (their spouses were also in attendance). In fact, it was the first time the Sowrey family was outnumbered at its own table. Also there was another relative, Brian Hogg. (The Hoggs are a couple branches over from the Sowreys, but I can&#8217;t remember exactly where or how.)<br />
Dinner began shortly after 4:00pm, when guests started arriving. Dinner was still being prepared (when you make a full roast turkey and a full roast beef dinner, you need two kitchens), which gave everyone else a chance to catch up with one another. We wouldn&#8217;t eat until about 7:00. And eat we did&#8230;<br />
A few helpings, lots of dessert, and perhaps a little too much to drink, and we were already to start playing games. Specifically, a game called Outburst, where the point is to try and guess all the items on a Top 10 list. It&#8217;s not as easy as it sounds. Even with topics we knew well, we never once got all 10 items.<br />
Dinner ended around 4:00am. I didn&#8217;t make it that long &#8212; I went to bed somewhere around 1am, as I knew I had to be up reasonably early (before 10am).<br />
On Boxing Day, I braved the trip into Toronto (via Go Train, what else?) to visit an old friend of mine, Mikki. She&#8217;s an old friend of mine from university who&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve been promising to visit with for ages, and it was high-time I did as I said. (I know, there&#8217;s about 20 of you who I should also visit with, some of whom have been a very long time, but I&#8217;d need at least a week for all that.) As it stands, I was supposed to meet with Dave on the following day, but I screwed up my schedules and had to cancel on him literally at the last minute.<br />
Walking in downtown Toronto, I came to realize why it is that 1) I don&#8217;t go shopping on Boxing Day, and 2) Why I try to avoid walking in downtown Toronto. I won&#8217;t even begin to describe the claustrophobia that seemed to set in when I saw the chaos in Eaton Centre.<br />
Before I knew it, I found myself at Pearson International again, waiting for my flight to Calgary. Like the flight out, this would be wall-to-wall people.<br />
It was good to be back in Calgary. Even better to be back in my apartment. Home truly is where the 50&#8243; TV and Playstation2 are.<br />
The rest of the vacation went well until Sunday, when a bad bit of Chinese took me down for a couple of days. I hadn&#8217;t had food poisoning in many years, so whatever it was that took me down was pretty strong. I&#8217;m still recovering. One advantage of it, though&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m losing all that weight I gained over the holidays.<br />
Happy 2002, everyone! Speaking of which&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Coming into work on a Friday with a hangover is one of the worst feelings.<br />
Well, coming in on a Monday is probably worse, now that I think about it.<br />
Last night was Critical Mass&#8217; annual Christmas party. This year, we held it at the Scandinavian Centre in northwest Calgary. It&#8217;s basically a large hall &#8212; we needed something that could pack in about 400 people. But that wasn&#8217;t all that would be there&#8230;<br />
Chris, Adrian, Doug, and I arrived late. Chris had to make some last-minute changes to the video on our Christmas promotion, so we didn&#8217;t get to the party until nearly 7:30. (It started at 6:00.) Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t taken dinner away yet, so we got to partake of the meal.<br />
Turkey, of course.<br />
The awkwardness of being the last people to arrive soon subsided, and we started chatting with those around us. Luckily, the last available seats were with people we knew. Not sure if they saved them for us or not, but it still worked out.<br />
The entertainment began about a half hour after we arrived. First were a couple of speeches by Jerry (our CEO, based in Chicago) and Diane (our President, based here in Calgary). Then it really began. A man walked up on stage. Didn&#8217;t know who he was, had never seen him before. He wore a Santa hat, a suit with a bowtie, and wielded an accordion.<br />
That&#8217;s usually not a good sign.<br />
Okay, accordion music, I thought, I can handle that. Then someone started talking to the crowd. It wasn&#8217;t the accordion player. I looked around, trying to figure out where the sound was coming from. It was a lounge singer. A really bad, exceptionally cheesy, lounge singer. Hired to torture us. He made bad jokes, had bad hair, had really bad taste in clothes. In short, perfect for the job.<br />
At first, he just clowned around, trying to get us to accept that he was bad. Didn&#8217;t take a lot of effort. Then he switched into the next part of his act. Armed with what had to have been a premeditated choice, he pulled Dan (our Canadian Vice-President and head of the Mercedes account) on stage. To do a duet. Of Sonny and Cher. And Dan lost the coin toss.<br />
Not that Dan had a choice anyway&#8230;<br />
It got worse. After the Sonny and Cher revival, he grabbed three more people (all bald men) and had them be three of the Beatles. They sang &#8220;Twist and Shout&#8221;, and surprisingly well, I have to say. But then the coup de gras came when he found five more people (including two of our more introverted staff) to come up on stage and become &#8220;The Village People&#8221;.<br />
All in all, the guy&#8217;s act was pretty good. And we all really needed the laugh.<br />
Soon, the entertainment was over, and the dancing began. People milled, people talked, a few left early, but a large number held out to the end of the night. About 2:00am.<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have to be in until 10:00am. Even then, some still showed up late. But today wasn&#8217;t a big day anyway &#8212; the office officially closed at 2:00pm MST.<br />
In other words, that&#8217;s the news, and I am outta here&#8230;<br />
To each of you, I wish the best of holidays and a safe break from your daily life. May you all have a wonderful time, and I&#8217;ll be writing more in the New Year!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When the temperature falls to -21 degrees with the wind chill, and the sky dumps 15 centimetres of snow on the ground, that&#8217;s when a young man&#8217;s fancy turns to&#8230;<br />
Revenge.<br />
Some months ago, Chris&#8217; and my collective birthday to be exact, our friend Teak decided that he would give us each a small token of &#8230; well, sugar. Specifically, a lunchbox full of it. When I opened my little gift, candy spilled all over my desk. How he managed to get the candy in there and the lid shut is beyond me&#8230;<br />
Needless to say, when word of Teak&#8217;s birthday came roaming around, Chris and I started thinking. Initially, it wasn&#8217;t anything mean or nasty, but then Chris joked about getting even with Teak for the months of sugar. (I still have some of mine.) It wasn&#8217;t too long before the joke turned serious, and it was time to execute.<br />
Step 1: The plan.<br />
This was perhaps the easiest part. The basic principle was sound: Get one of Teak&#8217;s desk-side cabinets (they&#8217;re a little over two feet tall, about one and a half feet deep, and a foot and a quarter wide &#8212; I don&#8217;t have a ruler, so these are estimates). Empty it. Then refill it. With candy. The trick, of course, was to do it when Teak wasn&#8217;t around (he&#8217;s been in the office late a lot, so working around that was a bit tricky).<br />
Step 2: The supplies.<br />
Sugar. And lots of it. In short, a trip to Costco, about the only place we can get such huge quantities of glucose goodness without completely breaking the bank. There&#8217;s a lot to consider when buying for a stunt such as this. You don&#8217;t want full-sized chocolate bars &#8212; they&#8217;re too big. Halloween ones would have been perfect, but those haven&#8217;t been in the stores for almost a month. You also have to be careful not to get too much of one thing. For example, too many M&amp;Ms, although perfect for something like this, means you need more of them. Also, you want variety.<br />
This meant we had to carefully choose our ammunition. I wish I&#8217;d remembered to bring the list of things we bought, but it&#8217;s along the lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four boxes of sour gummies (including cherry and watermelon flavours)</li>
<li>Two small tubs of more sour gummies</li>
<li>One tub of marshmallow rats (yes, rats)</li>
<li>One large tub of sugar lollipops</li>
<li>One small tub of Chupa Chups (lollipops)</li>
<li>One box of Blue Whales (gummies that taste like those blue freezies)</li>
<li>A couple packages of marshmallow peaches</li>
<li>Two huge bags of M&amp;Ms (peanut variety)</li>
<li>Two bags of Jelly Belly jelly beans</li>
<li>One container of candy necklaces</li>
<li>One tub of Double Bubble gum (the ones with Bazooka Joe comics)</li>
<li>Three boxes of chocolate and caramel Rice Krispie squares (about the healthiest thing we threw in)</li>
<li>One large bag of Werther&#8217;s (sp?) caramels</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s probably more, but we were having too much fun shopping for this stuff.<br />
Step 3: The prank.<br />
I was in the office again this weekend, partly because I had some work to do, partly because I&#8217;m overhauling my personal website (coming soon to a URL near you), and on Sunday, because I had to know when Teak wasn&#8217;t here anymore.<br />
Around 6:30pm, I took a short trip upstairs. First good news: Teak wasn&#8217;t there. Second good news: Neither was anyone else. Best good news: The poor fool had left his cabinet unlocked. A little after 7:00, Chris called to say he was ready to have fun. I whipped over to the apartment, picked up my roommate and brother in mischief, and returned to the office.<br />
The security guard was puzzled to say the least when we walked in with two huge boxes overflowing with packages of candy. We went upstairs to the Creative Services floor, and found that the lights were still off. (I&#8217;d turned them off when I&#8217;d inspected the floor earlier.)<br />
The first thing we had to do was clean out his cabinet &#8212; the lower part, anyway. Teak had a lot of files, which would of course get in the way when trying to empty the various tubs, boxes, and bags. Fortunately, there are other cabinets which weren&#8217;t in use. A simple transfer, and we were on our way.<br />
Almost &#8230; first, we had to line the lower bin with waxed paper. We didn&#8217;t want to make a total mess.<br />
Then came the fun part &#8212; filling the drawers. Taking several containers, we started pouring. Mind you, this isn&#8217;t some random thing &#8212; you have to do it carefully. You don&#8217;t want to make a parfait of candy &#8212; you want a nice, even dispersion. We had to mix a few times to get the right distribution. But the end effect looks &#8230; nasty, actually, and the smell&#8217;s quite powerful.<br />
Filling the lower drawer, we proceeded to the upper drawer (filling it with mostly small stuff, including M&amp;Ms, and finally the top bin (which sits under the seat), also nice and full. The surprising part was that we&#8217;d had leftovers. We&#8217;d originally thought we didn&#8217;t have enough, and worried that the joke would only be partially realized. But &#8217;tis better to have too much and do the job right than not have enough and do a half-assed job.<br />

The final touch was on Teak&#8217;s computer. Like most of our Designers, he has two monitors (one is usually for seeing the artwork, the second for all the tools). Chris made up two images that were placed on the backgrounds of each of the monitors. One read &#8220;Sugar is sweet.&#8221;, the other &#8220;Revenge is sweeter.&#8221;<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop giggling the entire time. I so wanted to put up a camera and videotape Teak&#8217;s arrival this morning. I so wish I could have seen the look on his face.<br />
Ah well, all&#8217;s well that ends well. At least until Teak tries to up the ante. If he&#8217;s smart, he won&#8217;t &#8212; starting an arms race with us is &#8230; foolish.<br />
All I can say is: There&#8217;s always room for&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are times when I wonder if I&#8217;m slightly psychic. Every time it happens, it gives me the willies. This was one time I sincerely wished I was wrong.<br />
Since long before the trip with 6060, I&#8217;d had this feeling, thought, dream, whatever you want to call it, that one of our engineers was going to die somewhere around Jasper. Most of the engineers are old &#8212; well into their 70s, and after a lifetime of working in coal dust, smoke, soot, and grease, probably not as healthy as they could be. (That said, they certainly look healthy.)<br />
In my foresight, I had believed that Harry would fall ill and die during the trip. In that respect, I was wrong. However, my mortal prediction still came true. On Sunday 28 October, at approximately 10:00 in the morning, Tom Arnott suffered a cardiac arrest while sitting in the crew car. Although there were other crew present, and 911 dialed almost immediately, the arrest was severe. Paramedics worked to save his life, and he was believed to have stabilized at Jasper Hospital some time later. But the damage was too far gone. I didn&#8217;t know at the time (I had to leave for home, and heard the news only 20 minutes ago), Tom never recovered.<br />
Tom was an ex-CN engineer, and had lived in Jasper quite a long time. Harry and Tom had known each other for many years, Harry&#8217;s son Cameron had regularly gone to Tom&#8217;s house to visit. Like Harry, Tom had surrounded himself with the railroad, even after retirement. Tom spent the last few years working with Alberta Prairie Steam Excursions, as one of the lead engineers on #41. Tom was also a secondary on 6060, and had fired the engine from Edson to Hinton on the trip.<br />
Tom was a kind and gentle man, loved by many, disliked by very few. Like other old hoggers, he had many stories of his life on the rails. Now, those stories can only be told by those who had heard them before.<br />
The light in the firebox is out, and the boiler gone cold. Old engineers never die, they just run out of steam.<br />
Farewell, my friend.</p>

1 Great Vacation<br />
What many people everyday call work, I call relaxation.<br />
While I would love to sit here and type out every single little excrutiating detail, I&#8217;m going to spare you the agony and cover only the highlights.<br />
1) Vancouver<br />
I went to Vancouver on 18 October for, of all things, a party. Radical held it&#8217;s 10th Anniversary celebrating its success over the years. As a former employee, I was invited along to partake in the festivities.<br />
In addition to seeing friends I hadn&#8217;t seen in a few years, and making a few new acquaintances, I tried to remember why I&#8217;d left Radical two years ago. I still haven&#8217;t been able to give myself a suitable answer.<br />
2) The Great Train Trip<br />
Returning to Calgary on the Friday (19 October) &#8212; I flew &#8212; I proceeded to pack and prepare for Phase II of my vacation: Helping run 6060 on its biggest excursion in years. We were going to run it all the way to Jasper.<br />
This has been Harry&#8217;s dream for many years, taking 6060 back to his home town in celebration &#8212; and bring it in under it&#8217;s own power. This was something we&#8217;d been preparing for most of the summer, and we (there were up to 16 of us helping to run the train) were anxious.<br />
It started with a quick run to Stettler from Warden. There we found our mechanical glitch for the trip, which was quickly fixed. Then on to Red Deer, where we turned around and headed north to Edmonton. A stopover to pick up rail cars, we were off to Edson, Hinton, and ultimately, Jasper.<br />
I drove the entire way, chasing the train, taking pictures and shooting video footage. It was a wild ride, and my poor car had to endure the worst punishment any K-car should ever be subjected to.<br />
I&#8217;m going to bronze that car when it finally dies.<br />
The trip ended, for me anyway, in Jasper. Although there&#8217;s still the return leg and the winterizing of 6060, I&#8217;ll be trapped here in the office. The season is now officially over. Work won&#8217;t start again until January, which is fine with me. It&#8217;ll take that long to edit the movie.<br />
Why the shortness of detail? Simply put, I&#8217;m writing this one out in detail, and it&#8217;s going to take a while. When it&#8217;s up, you&#8217;ll know&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, I had meant to write this earlier this week, but after what happened on Tuesday, I hope you can understand why there&#8217;s a delay.<br />
Most of you probably don&#8217;t know that I went back to Toronto on the weekend. It was a little longer than the whip-in/whip-out trips I usually do for such things &#8212; normally I fly out Friday evenings and fly back Sunday evenings, but I took two extra days this time. Work has been stressful, and this was a more special event than normal, so I wanted to take my time.<br />
The event was the wedding of perhaps my oldest friend, Mark Robinson. How old? Well, let me put it to you this way &#8212; many people can remember, at least vaguely, when they first met someone. I don&#8217;t remember when I met the Robinsons. Our parents met about 30 years ago. My mother and Mrs. Robinson are best of friends (we&#8217;ve often joked about putting in a dedicated phone between the two houses). We used to have Christmas and New Years dinners together. It&#8217;s a long, sordid history.<br />
Mark, his sister Julie, my sister Cathy, myself, and two other neighbourhood kids, AJ and Kelly, made up the neighbourhood mob. We played baseball (with tennis balls), swam, help mini-Olympics, and generally raised a ruckus around the blocks. Mark was generally the ringleader, being the oldest of us &#8212; me being just shy of two years younger.<br />
When Mark was enrolled in Appleby College in Grade 4 or 5 (can&#8217;t remember which), we started seeing less of him. When Grade 9 rolled around, he stayed at Appleby nearly all the time (it was a requirement). Then came university, and I saw less of almost everyone. Over the years, separation was inevitable.<br />
Cathy, on the other hand, stuck to the Robinsons like glue &#8212; Julie still being one of Cathy&#8217;s best friends. As a result, Cathy got to know Mark&#8217;s friends from Appleby and university. (The keg parties were talk of legend after a while.)<br />
When news of Mark&#8217;s engagement came around last December, I felt like I&#8217;d missed something. About 15 years, to be exact. Once upon a time, I&#8217;d looked up to Mark &#8212; he was my role model as a child. He was strong, brave, and a natural leader. Sure, we had our disagreements (most friends do), but overall I still admired him. News of the engagement drew pangs of regret &#8212; I&#8217;d stayed away so long, I&#8217;d missed watching one of my friends grow up. I barely knew the person I had once aspired to be. I didn&#8217;t even know his fiancée, Darla.<br />
So needless to say, I was quite happy to hear I would be invited to the wedding. I had missed Julie&#8217;s wedding (I couldn&#8217;t afford the flight to Antigua from Calgary at the time), but I wasn&#8217;t about to miss another Robinson wedding. So I booked a flight (a bit more expensive than I would have liked, admittedly) and whisked myself back to Ontario.<br />
I left Friday morning. That morning, it was 3 degrees Celsius in Calgary. It would be 29 degrees when I landed in Toronto. Choosing an appropriate set of clothes to handle the change in weather was mildly difficult &#8212; I froze in Calgary, and boiled in Oakville.<br />
The wedding was on the Saturday, and would be the first one I&#8217;d been to that started in late afternoon (4:30). It was a little odd, because it meant I was idle for most of the morning. So naturally, there was a massive rush around 3:50 to get everyone together and out the door so we could make it on time. As Appleby College is in Oakville, it was a quick trip over.<br />
The ceremony was in Appleby&#8217;s chapel, an old ivy-covered building designed in the traditional British school chapel style, with pews running perpendicular to the altar, rather than parallel. It was also traditional in that it had no air conditioning. Although my new suit is much lighter than my previous ones, it was still very warm. Most people were sweating profusely (I can only imagine what Mark and Darla must&#8217;ve felt like).<br />
It was a large affair &#8212; about 150 people (that&#8217;s a complete guesstimate, I have no idea really how many people showed up). The wedding party had four people apiece. Family was everywhere.<br />
Being an Anglican ceremony, it was quick. A few quick words, the odd speech, and in 15 minutes, we were back outside. Although still 30-odd degrees, it was cooler than inside, and had a breeze. We stood around, took lots of pictures of the newlyweds, before heading off back home for a quick stop.<br />
Then it was off to downtown Toronto, and the reception at the University of Toronto&#8217;s Hart House. Hart House (just west of Queen&#8217;s Park) is one of UofT&#8217;s oldest buildings, constructed in the late 19th century. It&#8217;s built in the London gothic style, and provided an unbelievable backdrop for the wedding. Mark and Darla had provided for their guests lavishly &#8212; oysters on the half-shell, smoked salmon, and an open bar with nearly unlimited supplies of excellent red and white Henry of Pelham wines. (Two of their wedding party &#8212; a married couple &#8212; run the vinery.)<br />
And that was just the pre-reception. Dinner was yet to follow.<br />
After another round of pictures in the Hart House courtyard, we moved indoors to the grand Great Hall for dinner. I was seated with my parents, the Robinson&#8217;s, and their relatives (not all of them, anyway), right in front of the head table. Mr. Robinson gave his speech in typically Mr. Robinson style (a combination of dry wit, bad jokes, and the odd bout of seriousness), followed by speeches by the best man (Brent) and maid of honour (Darla&#8217;s sister, Jillian).<br />
Then dinner was served.<br />
Wow.<br />
I can&#8217;t really think of anything else to say, but &#8220;wow&#8221;. It was an amazing meal &#8212; Mark and Darla, unfortunately, had a reputation to uphold (started with Mark&#8217;s keg parties), and they had to deliver. They did so in exceptional style and taste:<br />
The appetizer was roasted butternut squash soup with fresh rosemary with a dollop of low fat maple yogurt. It was followed by baby spinach leaves with toasted pecans, strawberries, and crumbled Stilton cheese with an apple-Dijon dressing. Eyaa. The entree were medallions of beef tenderloin (the &#8220;medallions&#8221; were huge &#8212; the size of coffee cups) with roasted shallots in a port reduction. Yowza. Dessert was fresh fruit with a warm triple sec sabayon and a crisp wafer. Topped off with a small glass of Late Harvest Vidal dessert wine.<br />
My tastebuds were in Heaven.<br />
I was one of few who actually ate everything. Most people couldn&#8217;t pack it all back. Their loss &#8212; the dinner was outstanding. Although it did take a while to digest.<br />
Mark and Darla seemed to hardly eat. They spent a good chunk of time visiting the tables, seeing the people they invited, and being the quintessential hosts. They made brief trips back to the table for bites of food, but spent most of the their time walking around. Their only other interruptions were for kisses.<br />
Goofy tradition, that kissing thing. Never understood that. But things were different here. No tinking of glasses. This round involved answering trivia questions, kept in balloons that had to be popped before a question could be answered. (I presume this was to prevent people from looking at a question and then backing off if they didn&#8217;t know the answer &#8212; the popping balloon put the people at centre stage.) I was impressed with myself &#8212; I actually knew most of the questions about Mark. I felt a little relieved that I hadn&#8217;t drifted so far away.<br />
After dinner, it was time for Mark&#8217;s speech. (He spoke for Darla as well &#8212; I guess she didn&#8217;t want to make a speech herself.) It started off with:</p>
<blockquote><p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m married &#8230; and she&#8217;s <em>hot</em>!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark&#8217;s speech used humour, history, and few tugs at the heartstrings. (Julie threatened to kill Mark if he ever made her cry like that again.) Suddenly, I didn&#8217;t feel quite so distant.<br />
Dancing would have began after that, but first one little bit of housekeeping had to be taken care of. From the day Mark proposed to Darla, there had been a joke floating around, and Ed (one of the groomsmen) was to be the instrument of delivery. Originally planned for the Recessional during the marriage ceremony, it had been delayed until the end of dinner.<br />
Ed walked over to the dance floor, picked up his guitar, and prepared to play. A few of us knew what he was going to sing. As far as I knew, Darla didn&#8217;t know &#8212; which, I believe, was the point. After a quick tune, he started strumming and singing. A few people picked it up right away, but it wasn&#8217;t really until the chorus that most people, Darla included, realized he was singing Simon and Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Mrs. Robinson&#8221;. He would follow up with a U2 song, but I&#8217;m at a loss to remember which one&#8230;<br />
The First Dance came soon after. People then began to mill around &#8212; some danced, some went outdoors, and few began to trickle out the door to go home. We stuck around until closing time, somehow&#8230;<br />
Perhaps it was the drink, perhaps it was exhaustion, perhaps it was the heat &#8212; I still had trouble looking at Mark and accepting that he was married. (I still have that trouble with Julie, and she&#8217;s been married for 10 months.) It seems that the time from when I entered high school until now has just vanished. I&#8217;ve missed so much, and gained so little.<br />
Hopefully, the next 15 years won&#8217;t go so quickly.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Yesterday, someone whacked the biggest kid in the yard in the back of the head with a 2&#215;4. And now he&#8217;s very, very angry.<br />
Yesterday morning, for me, was of little consequence when I got up. I was tired, mostly due to jet lag. The temperature was 5 degrees. I checked the Weather Channel at 6:43am MST for an update. Just as all hell was beginning to break loose in New York.<br />
Oblivious to all that, I resumed my morning pattern of dressing, shaving, brushing teeth, and heading off to work. I walked &#8212; using my scooter, although faster, is a little awkward in pants. Even without headphones, I heard nothing out of the ordinary. To me, it was a cool, overcast morning. Perfectly normal.<br />
Arriving at work around 7:30, I logged in, started reading email, and looked at my daily miscellany of comics. Completely unaware that anything else was going on. Just before 8:00, I headed downstairs to get my breakfast, still holding to my daily schedule. Everything seemed normal &#8212; no news, no hints.<br />
As I climbed back up the stairs, I ran into a conversation that involved two planes hitting two towers. My immediate thoughts were small single-engine aircraft hitting electrical towers &#8212; a rare, but nonetheless believable scenario. Then Evelyn, our HR manager, mentioned something about the World Trade Center.<br />
Returning to my computer, I tried to log onto cnn.com. No response &#8212; it was overloaded. I tried cbc.ca. It, too, would not respond to my requests. Then I got the globeandmail.ca &#8212; the first news was &#8230; well, it was unbelievable. News started to fly around the room with fantastic speed &#8212; those of us just finding out were obtaining new bits of information from those who already knew. Commercial jets colliding with both towers of the World Trade Center.<br />
My first impression, like many people, was of disbelief. It didn&#8217;t make sense. From initial reports and accounts, it seemed like a hoax &#8212; a very well engineered prank by a bunch of hackers that had caught mainstream media off-guard. But as I kept hunting around, things didn&#8217;t seem so perfect &#8212; especially when I found my first image at the Houston Chronicle&#8217;s website. A fireball erupting from the side of the south tower. Reality slowly began to sink in.<br />
More and more people arrived, some already knowing what had happened, some unaware and succumbing to shock. Work ground to a halt as people started to talk amongst themselves, try to get information from websites, and listen to radio broadcasts.<br />
The Pentagon had been hit; part of it was collapsing. One of the World Trade Center towers collapsed from the damage. People were jumping from windows, some on fire, some (presumably) out of sheer desperation. Another plane crashed in a lonely corn field in rural Pennsylvania. The second World Trade Center tower crumbled. Death toll estimates were going as high as 50,000.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t stop the shivers running up and down my spine.<br />
Many of us gathered in the Met &#8212; the only meeting room with a video device &#8212; to watch an online broadcast of the BBC to learn anything we didn&#8217;t already know. Our company president, one of our lead Art Directors, and one of our business people were in New York. We had an office in New York. We didn&#8217;t know what their status was. Thirty minutes later, a phone call from a cell phone let us know that our comrades were okay, albeit stranded in Manhattan.<br />
Work resumed slowly, and remained slow for the remainder of the day. Some people were able to concentrate, but most couldn&#8217;t. Meetings, no matter the subject, spent more time discussing the tragedy in New York than how much budget to allocate for next year (that meeting had to be taken off-site so it could be completed) or how to fix a particular problem for a client.<br />
The day was pockmarked with bits of news and endless emails of links to images and video of the crashes. Cnn.com slowly came back up over the course of the day, its site stripped of all the basic essentials of text and the most simple of images. Even globeandmail.ca and cbc.ca had to redesign their sites to remove extraneous items.<br />
I somehow managed to forge through the day, leaving around 7:00pm. I walked home quickly, wanting to get the most up-to-date information from the news. Downtown Calgary was mostly deserted. Flags were being flown at half-staff. Even the venerable Starbucks at the corner of 8th Ave. and 4th St. SW bore a sign saying it would be closed due to the tragic events, and would reopen Wednesday.<br />
Almost every channel ran news feeds &#8212; either their own, or CNN&#8217;s. Commercial-free, and constantly reporting on new events, running footage from earlier in the day, or gathering commentary from experts and laymen alike. Although I had seen some of the video of the crashes and collapses throughout the day, nothing prepared me for the full clarity of watching a Boeing 767-200ER accelerate and arc effortlessly into the south tower of the World Trade Center.<br />
We think of skyscrapers as huge, hulking, and nigh-invulnerable edifices, able to take the most punishing abuse. They&#8217;re built with modern materials, armed with the most high-tech devices. As I watched as United Airlines flight 175 slipping into the south tower&#8217;s structure like a rock thrown into a pond, I found myself feeling less and less safe in my own apartment.<br />
I find little truly shocks me. This did, far more than I ever could have imagined.<br />
Until nearly 12:30am, I flipped between CBC, Global National, ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN, trying to learn all that I could, see what really transpired. Part of me wished I had been in New York &#8212; not to experience the horror first-hand, but to help. Part of me wished I could erase it from human history &#8212; I can only imagine how children must have to deal with such an unspeakable act, and how their parents will have to explain it.<br />
One of the many phrases that was regularly quoted by many people about yesterday was: &#8220;It was like a movie.&#8221; And that is possibly the single best description for something so surreal. Something so strange, so odd, and so utterly horrific. Because only in a movie would we consider something as terrible as we witnessed yesterday.<br />
That sentiment was echoed by others. One American, quoted on one of the hundreds of web pages I read yesterday, said: &#8220;This showed us that we are truly vulnerable.&#8221; Rex Murphy, commentator for the CBC, had a similar thought: We are as open to global terrorism as any other part of the world.<br />
This is a belief that has been engrained in Western Civilization, and most strongly in North America. We, as Canadians, could look at the United States and say that their arrogance was what set them up &#8212; poking noses where they&#8217;re not wanted, saying what&#8217;s on their mind even if the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t care, showing up at the world&#8217;s doorstep with their fancy weapons dictating politics. But we in Canada were equally as shocked. As Rex Murphy pointed out, we are no longer mere spectators &#8212; as much as the American psyche was shaken to the ground, so was the Canadian belief that we, too, are invulnerable. We are as exposed and defenceless as a newborn baby to someone determined enough to do us harm.<br />
Other newscasters had their comments, thoughts, and concerns. By the time I headed to bed, tired even from the beginning of the day (let alone the rest of the day&#8217;s events), the comments were becoming more incoherent, more strained, and weary. Peter Jennings was out of energy, and fidgeting in his seat. Dan Rather looked 10 years older. Even Peter Mansbridge looked like he was trying to pull another 30-hour marathon in front of the camera.<br />
We praise our media for bringing us the most recent news as quickly as possible. Yesterday, someone put that desire to their advantage to shock a continent. I know I shall have a hard time forgetting what I saw. The media, however, is what we wanted, and up-to-the-minute horror is what we got. A chalkboard sign out in front of Darby O&#8217;Gills, a pub just down the block from where I live, put it best in three simple words:<br />
We have CNN.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Another summer has come and (almost) gone. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t a summer spent indoors, stuck in front of my computer (as much as it might have actually felt like that). Given, I had hoped to get out more to places I hadn&#8217;t been before, but at least I got to a couple.<br />
The weekend started with sleep. The past couple of weeks have been extremely tiring, and I needed the Saturday to sleep. I rose with ample time to get ready to go outside &#8230; to go see a movie.<br />
Yeah, I know, with all the trouble I went through to get out of the office, you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be trying to go somewhere and be one with nature. Well, there&#8217;s plenty of time for that &#8212; it&#8217;s not every day you can catch a running of &#8220;Raiders of the Lost Ark&#8221; in a theatre.<br />
It was an original print &#8212; 20 years old. The colour had faded slightly, the sound and picture was a little scratchy, and even a few scenes were missing. But even with the flaws, you would have had a hard time trying to remove the grin from my face. I hadn&#8217;t felt that good seeing a matinee since I was a teenager.<br />
I also realized for the first time that there was such a thing as a &#8220;modern classic&#8221; film. I had a concern for many years that there would never been a true &#8220;classic&#8221; film made during my lifetime. Sure, there would be the big budget Hollywood blockbusters, which are all fine and dandy to watch once in a while, but are generally fluff. As I watched &#8220;Raiders&#8221;, I came the realization that it was possible. It sounds a little weird to notice something like that, but for some reason, it suddenly made the movie all the better. And seeing it without all the digital processing made it seem even more real.<br />
The day barely half-over, I opted to go for a walk after the movie. I wound my way down to 17th Avenue, where a good portion of Calgary&#8217;s downtown life normally resides. I say &#8220;normally&#8221; because it wasn&#8217;t there that day. Calgary Public Works had cut off traffic from 3rd Street to 8th Street so they could repave. The area was close to dead.<br />
Which means perfect for shopping.<br />
Okay, so I wasn&#8217;t really looking for anything in particular. But when Blockbuster starts selling off their used movies at rock-bottom prices, well, it&#8217;s kinda hard to resist. And it didn&#8217;t hurt that I finally found the perfect cheese shop &#8212; no Kraft, thank you. The most mass-produced cheese they had was from Balderson&#8217;s, which as far as I&#8217;m concerned is premium.<br />
I&#8217;m really beginning to like this city.<br />
On Sunday, I made the attempt to go to Warden to work on 6060. Although I arrived a little late (9:15), no-one was there to greet me. I had been somewhat concerned that no-one would be there. Normally, they call me and let me know if no-one will be there. Having received no such call, I figured I was safe. Dopey me.<br />
Waiting around until 10:00, I decided I was on my own, and headed off in search of something I hadn&#8217;t seen before. There&#8217;s a lot of prairie out here, and a lot to see. One example: Rowley. It&#8217;s a very small little town (population: about 10, including the dog I saw wandering down the road) nestled in the middle of nowhere. It used to have a rail line (the same one that runs from Stettler to Big Valley, before CN ripped up the rest of the line that ran all the way down to Drumheller), but now has only a railway station, three grain elevators (none in use) and some old, empty buildings.<br />
I continued down through Drumheller, and out to Horseshoe Canyon. Usually, you can wander through without seeing too many people. But on this long weekend, it was packed. (The campgrounds west of Calgary and south of the TransCanada highway were closed for fire hazard, so people had to find something else to do.) I didn&#8217;t hang around too long. I zig-zagged the rest of my way across the plains until I got home, around 3:00 that afternoon.<br />
On Monday, we met up with Stuart, Therese, and Geoff. Geoff is one of Therese&#8217;s classmates who had just returned from a year in the States on a practicum. We celebrated with the best thing going &#8212; dim sum, of course. It was an extra long one for us &#8212; nearly two hours.<br />
Following our repast, we followed the two general rituals: Buying candy in the mall next door, and then shopping. We started off on 17th Avenue, but eventually ended up at Chinook Centre to continue the spree. Oddly enough, I was pretty much the only one who bought anything. (Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around.)<br />
That evening, I spent my last few hours of summerly freedom wandering around in the dying light, taking pictures of Calgarians trying to get their last good burst of summer.<br />
Good thing, too. It was 3 degrees this morning.</p>
