	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once in a while, someone notices you. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a pretty woman walking down the street. Sometimes it&#8217;s a friend you haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. And once in a while, it&#8217;s your entire company.<br />
This year, starting in our Town Hall meeting in June, Critical Mass decided to implement a kind of &#8220;employee of the month&#8221; award. It&#8217;s formally called the &#8220;Critical Mass Valuable Person&#8221;, or cMVP for short. The criteria for nomination are pretty straight-forward:<br />
(Taken from the nomination form)</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplifies our values:</li>
<ul>
<li>Commitment to Excellence &amp; Results</li>
<li>Teamwork &amp; Respect</li>
<li>Creativity &amp; Innovation</li>
<li>Leadership &amp; Accountability</li>
<li>Integrity &amp; Honesty</li>
</ul>
<li>Is technically superior in their job</li>
<li>Has a consistent, positive attitude towards clients, fellow project team members, fellow colleagues, their job and Critical Mass</li>
<li>Is reliable and conscientious in everyday tasks and job expectations</li>
<li>Strives to learn continuously on a personal level or by facilitating learning for others</li>
<li>Displays initiative by taking on projects outside of their job description</li>
<li>Shares ideas and contributes to best practices at a project, department or company level</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty high standards, if you ask me. And considering that the timeframe is (ideally) a month, that&#8217;s an awful lot of work to have to pull off for someone to take notice. I also cannot really see myself completely fulfilling some of these criteria. Take &#8220;technically superior&#8221;. It&#8217;s a little subjective. As a Web Developer, I&#8217;ll rate myself as, say, better than average. But technically superior? I can&#8217;t honestly agree to that &#8212; there&#8217;s a lot of people here who can code circles around me.<br />
No-one who receives the cMVP knows about it going into the presentation. They&#8217;re just a face in the crowd, like everyone else. Where I was standing, I couldn&#8217;t hear much, aside from snippets of what this person was like. When I heard &#8220;takes pictures of all our events&#8221;, my heart stopped for a moment. I do that. It could be me. But then I dismissed it &#8212; Jude takes lots of pictures, and with everything he does, I&#8217;d expect him long before me.<br />
&#8220;This month&#8217;s cMVP is Geoff Sowrey.&#8221;<br />
I froze. Blood ran cold. Eyes bugged out.<br />
Me??<br />
Stunned. Pure stunned. Nothing more eloquent will ever fully describe the feeling of total shock I felt when I heard my name. I stood in place, people around me staring (and clapping, I think), for what seemed an eternity before I got myself to move. Thelton, our President and COO, the person giving out the award, couldn&#8217;t even see me from where I was standing.<br />
Ever since the cMVP was first announced, I had wished I could qualify for it. But there are a lot of people in this company deserving of such an award. They put in a lot of effort, sometimes for little more than a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. While my wildest dreams had me winning cMVP, my reality was quite content to nominate others and not worry about it.<br />
Winning the cMVP is like an Emmy or an Oscar. You&#8217;re nominated by your peers, although it&#8217;s the Executive who selects you. It&#8217;s the second-highest award you can win here. (The highest is the cMVP of the Year, which has yet to be given out.) That&#8217;s just fine with me &#8212; I&#8217;ll be flying quite high on this for a while, I think.<br />
So I find myself here, on a Monday that&#8217;s not going nearly as well as I&#8217;d have liked, typing away about something I won (I very much hesitate using the word &#8220;deserved&#8221;) with still-shaking hands. It&#8217;s an honour that I&#8217;ll have to live up to even more than I apparently already do.<br />
I don&#8217;t toot my own horn (at least too often). But I certainly won&#8217;t object to others tooting it for me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Way back in early August, I learned the awful truth that Therese and Stuart were moving to Montreal, ne&#8217;er to return. (Okay, that&#8217;s an assumption. They might, but I ain&#8217;t holding my breath.)<br />
Needless to say, I suddenly ran into the problem of living in the big city of Calgary without any close friends. (Okay, that&#8217;s an exaggeration. I do have a fabulous roommate &#8212; say &#8220;hi&#8221;, Tamara!) Faced with a prolonged period of time (mostly) alone, I felt I needed something a little more.<br />
Now, my experience in this city has been one of dichotomy. While it appears to be full of young, single people, none of them appear to be women and even fewer seem to be interested in me. Given, I wasn&#8217;t trolling bars or clubs. That&#8217;s because the pickings in those places is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that when you&#8217;re looking for Dom Perignon, y&#8217;ain&#8217;t about to settle for Baby Duck.<br />
This is what led me to (drum roll, please) the Internet.<br />
You: And here I thought you were going to say &#8220;train station&#8221;.<br />
Me: Ha ha&#8230;<br />
You: Though I suppose we shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised about the Internet, either.<br />
Me: Remember who you&#8217;re talking to.<br />
As was once quoted in the movie &#8220;American Pie&#8221;, God bless the Internet. You can find *anything* there. I mean it &#8212; look long enough, and you&#8217;ll eventually come across something that pretty much fits exactly what you need.<br />
This is how I found Erin.<br />
A couple years ago, I&#8217;d heard of a site called &#8220;Lavalife&#8221;. It&#8217;s a pseudo-dating site. I say &#8220;pseudo&#8221; because the site itself does nothing to set you up with anyone else. It&#8217;s solely for providing a place for people find each other. It&#8217;s up to the individual to contact someone else. What happens from there is up to you and your ability not to come across as a schmuck.<br />
And yes, somehow, I managed to do just that. (Or Erin is kind enough to overlook and not mention it.)<br />
We met online, under aliases, and exchanged email. (It shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising as a result that email constitutes the majority of our communication.) That led to online chatting (through MSN) and eventually to the (*gasp*) phone number exchange. It was still a while after that before we actually met for the first time.<br />
This is the great thing about using the Internet for dating, particularly on dating sites such as Lavalife: quality. (Okay, not entirely true. Erin&#8217;s told me a few horror stories of some of the guys she met online.) Generally-speaking, people who come to Lavalife have a similar goal: to meet someone else. You&#8217;re not dealing with pounding music, a smoky room, or people so fake that it&#8217;s actually painful. There&#8217;s no commitment, and there&#8217;s no requirement. It&#8217;s just you, a keyboard, and a digital photo of yourself (technically optional, but you&#8217;ll want one anyway).<br />
Somehow, all that managed to get me introduced to Erin, though I honestly can&#8217;t remember who made first contact. (Not that it really matters now.)<br />
So, what do you want to know about Erin? Well, she&#8217;s a little younger than I (if you think I&#8217;m giving out age, you&#8217;re definitely mistaken), a little shorter than me (which is not a big deal), but is big on conversation, movies, having a good time, and above all, getting to know people. We clicked on the first date, which either says a lot for me, or for Erin&#8217;s ability to see past all that freakishness that seems to scare everyone else away.<br />
One of the weirdest things, which we learned very early on in one of our phone calls, is that we work barely over a block from each other. Were it not for the Ribtor building, we&#8217;d probably be able to see each other&#8217;s workplace. Unfortunately, despite proximity, having mutual lunches is exceedingly difficult due to Erin&#8217;s schedule. Perhaps one day&#8230;<br />
So you could say that I have a new girlfriend. Well, sorta, anyway. For now, we&#8217;re sticking to just &#8220;seeing each other&#8221;. It&#8217;s not for a want of using something more definite, but just because we don&#8217;t want to rush things too much (we&#8217;re still firmly in &#8220;Discovery&#8221; mode). But I see no reason why I wouldn&#8217;t be calling Erin my girlfriend before too long.<br />
And this time, she&#8217;s not a 637,540 pound steam locomotive. (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]] for an explanation of that little joke.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There is nothing harder in life than saying goodbye to a loved one. This evening, I had to make the hardest choice of my life. This evening, I had to put my beloved Siamese cat to sleep. A year and a half and one day ago, my father passed away. Tonight, Spaz goes to join him, together again. They were inseparable while Dad was alive. It seems only fitting that they are now reunited.<br />
It is particularly hard to accept this, especially coming after yesterday&#8217;s high, remembering the first anniversary of the CBC 50th Anniversary Train. To come from a high to a low in such a period certainly does not help one&#8217;s happiness quotia. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve had too much to drink for one night, in a vain attempt to kill the pain.<br />
Spaz was born in either 1989 or 1991, depending on who you ask. I believe it is the former, but her medical records suggest the latter. She was a gift from my Aunt Ruth to my grandmother, who named her Yum-Yum, after one of the characters in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;Mikado&#8221;. My grandmother wasn&#8217;t one for names, though, and soon was calling her &#8220;Puss&#8221;, as she had every other cat. I was the only one who called her &#8220;Spaz&#8221;, referring to her spastic behaviour as a kitten.<br />
Over the years, Spaz became an absolutely personable cat. She would immediately warm up to whomever was in the room, usually beelining for the person most allergic to her. She rarely bit anyone, and if she did it was because they weren&#8217;t giving her enough seafood. After Grandma moved into a retirement apartment, Dad took in Spaz, where they became fast friends. Spaz saw much of North America travelling with my parents. When Dad died last year, I took Spaz into my home, as Mom has never really been a huge fan of pets. Spaz and I enjoyed over a year together, sleeping in the same bed, often under the same covers.<br />
(I should note that when I spoke with Mom earlier this evening, she was almost as upset as I was. Mom might have not been a big fan of pets, but Spaz was such a great cat that she grew on everyone around her.)<br />
Over the last two months, I saw a change in Spaz, though I wasn&#8217;t fully willing to accept it. Mom was the one to finally bring it to light when she was out visiting. Spaz was underweight. She was not as responsive as in her glory. I think I refused to believe that perhaps the end was in sight.<br />
Yesterday, as Tamara and I returned from a matinee, I found Spaz coughing in a way I&#8217;d never seen her before, and spitting up material I&#8217;d never seen. Fearing the worst, I immediately took her to the Calgary North Animal Hospital (on a recommendation from Scott and Tara, whose cats have visited probably more times than they care to wish). Spaz was immediately admitted and almost immediately transferred to an oxygen tent. Blue at admitting, she was soon able to breathe.<br />
I waited in Exam Room 1 for the doctor, reading the poster for anatomy on ferrets. Outside, I could hear a boy, no more than five years old, crying desperately to his mother about never seeing his pet again. Inside, I felt like that five year old. Somehow, I knew that Spaz would never be coming home again.<br />
Over the next 18 hours, Spaz was checked, prodded, poked, and tested. At about 16:45, I received a call from Dr. Henderson, who began to explain to me the seriousness of Spaz&#8217;s condition. Although she didn&#8217;t say it outright, I knew what she was telling me. Spaz&#8217;s life was at an end, and there was likely little veterinary science could do to save her. I had known Spaz for almost half my life, and while I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her go, I wasn&#8217;t willing to let her suffer for my own selfish needs.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what exactly Spaz was suffering from, neither did Dr. Henderson. But suffering, she was. Blood tests were inconclusive, but Dr. Henderson was confident that the problems weren&#8217;t from asthma, which Spaz had dealt with for many years. This was far more serious. My conversation with the vet only seemed to conclude that tests would only show what would ultimately kill Spaz, not what could cure her.<br />
It was raining when Tamara and I drove up to the hospital. Spaz was in an incubator &#8212; the kind used for premature babies. She was warm, as I&#8217;d always hoped she&#8217;d be at the end. But she was unresponsive. She seemed to only vaguely know that we were there. There was no purring. Although she was lying upright (not on her side), she didn&#8217;t really respond the way she had less than two days before.<br />
We left the hospital, passing by the front clerk. She asked if we were sure that we didn&#8217;t want to be there with her. I barely choked out a &#8220;no, thanks&#8221; as we passed by. I nearly lost control twice on my way out the door. I couldn&#8217;t be there, although it broke my heart not to be with her at the end.<br />
It helped having Tamara with me as we drove home. Without her, I would not have been able to focus on the road. I was numb. When Dad passed away, I was saddened, but knew that his end was coming. Spaz&#8217;s death I was not prepared for, though I knew that by bringing her to Alberta, I might have only extended her life by a year. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for it.<br />
The best part about driving in the rain is that no-one can see you crying.<br />
Farewell, dear Spaz. May you, Dad, and Grandma be reunited again.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that it&#8217;s only been a year since the day the CBC Television 50th Anniversary VIA Rail Train departed Vancouver on its epic 33-day trip across Canada. It seems like it&#8217;s been a lot longer.<br />
I suppose part of that is because I live in Calgary, isolated from nearly everyone else on the trip. (Enza&#8217;s very close to me, living in Banff, but I don&#8217;t have the luxury of working in the same building, as most of the Toronto folk do.) I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to see a couple of people &#8212; Angela and Tracy when they stopped through on a documentary tour (see [[CBC documentaries at the Glenbow Museum]]), and Julie and Enza when Julie came out on a conference (we met in Banff). Beyond that, the only contact I&#8217;ve had is through email.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate saying goodbye to close friends. Early this morning, Therese and Stuart boarded their WestJet flight with a trunkful of luggage and two cats. They&#8217;re moving to Montreal. By about this time, they&#8217;re over Ontario, about an hour from landing in Ottawa.<br />
For the last three and a half years, I&#8217;ve had the luxury of living in a city with three of my closest friends. Chris lived with me for two of those years. But Chris moved to Japan, and while we do keep regular communication through email and ICQ, it&#8217;s just not the same as having him here. I didn&#8217;t see Stuart and Therese nearly as much as I would have liked, but having them in the same city was just somehow comforting.<br />
Now I feel almost alone. I have friends here, yes, but none like them. None with whom I have a great history. None where even just a simple hug can convey more words than a 100-page treatise on friendship. They&#8217;re more family than friend. I&#8217;ll see them again, of that there is no doubt, but it won&#8217;t be for at least a couple of weeks. (Both need to come back over the next two months, Stuart to get their belongings moved, and Therese for her dissertation.) After that, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess.<br />
On Saturday, I went to a small get-together for Stuart and Therese at Stephanie&#8217;s home. (Stephanie is Therese&#8217;s classmate and friend.) There were only about 10 people in attendance. I know them all, but hadn&#8217;t seen some in well over a year. We talked, ate, and played with Pepper, Stephanie and Ian&#8217;s Westhighland Terrier. Yet despite all the laughter and good humour, there was an underlying tension. Two people were leaving.<br />
I spent most of Sunday cleaning up around the house. I haven&#8217;t cleaned much this summer, owing to a busy schedule. Things are almost back to normal. It was a way for me to kill time until Therese and Stuart called. I had offered to take them out to dinner, but as with every major move I&#8217;ve ever seen, packing was still going on right until they called me at about 18:30, to help clean out Therese&#8217;s office.<br />
I felt strangely in the way as I helped move boxes of papers and books into the Jetta and the Mini. (If you think a Mini is small, just see what you can pack in one!) It took a couple of hours, but we made off with everything inside. Stuart and I would return later, having accidentally forgotten a poster in the computer lab (which led to a fairly tense time trying to remember the door code) and needing to drop off a guitar and a glass vase.<br />
Dropping Stuart off, I drove off into the night, with a single thought in my mind:<br />
Movement is life. Be it physical or existential, it is nonetheless important and necessary. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are moving from one city to the next, or from one state of mind to the next, just so long as you move. You will only feel true pain if you stop moving.<br />
Good luck, and best hopes and wishes, my friends! Never stop moving.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last weekend was the first weekend in a while where a) I wasn&#8217;t busy with work or family, and b) wasn&#8217;t trying to paint the house. (No, I&#8217;m not done painting. I&#8217;m just sick of it.) So I opted to relax a little bit.<br />
It was raining when I awoke Saturday. This is something we&#8217;ve been dying to happen for a while now, if for nothing else than to hopefully take some of the smoke out of the air. We&#8217;ve been plagued by smoke from forest fires in the Crowsnest Pass for days now, and it&#8217;s long since past that point where campfire smoke actually smells good. So began my lazy Saturday. It felt sooooo good.<br />
I spent most of the day watching TV and movies, and fidding around with my computer. (It was cool enough that I could have the computer on for long periods without fear of overheating.) In the late afternoon, Stuart called to see what I was up to. Having no specific plans (outside of expecting my friend Greg to appear at some point during the day), we loosely planned for a movie that evening.<br />
We then talked about Stuart and Therese&#8217;s big move. Therese has accepted a post-doctorate at the University of Montreal. This led Stuart to fly out to Montreal and find a new job. Which took about 20 seconds. Stuart has far too much talent and experience for his own good, it seems, and pretty much could walk into almost any agency and get snapped up right away. A better job, a better town, and a lot more than I&#8217;m being paid. [Insert sound of swallowed pride here.]<br />
But it means they have to move at the beginning of September. Although I don&#8217;t get to see Therese and Stuart as much as I&#8217;d like, I&#8217;m about to see them even less. I haven&#8217;t seen some of my friends in well over five years. It won&#8217;t be easy having them half-way across the country.<br />
However, I might end up following them out. Critical Mass is currently engaged in the single largest pitch we&#8217;ve ever engaged in. The potential is massive, and could totally change the way Critical Mass operates. It&#8217;s exciting and terrifying at the same time, and no-one here really knows what will happen if we do win the work. (We&#8217;ve got stiff competition, so we honestly don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;ll fare.)<br />
One thing we do know is that we&#8217;ll have to reopen the Toronto office, for a variety of reasons. First, it&#8217;s closer to the client than Calgary. Second, we&#8217;ll have an easier time finding suitable people in the Toronto market &#8212; we&#8217;ve pretty much depleted Calgary&#8217;s. Third, we&#8217;ll need to keep the team separate from the one in Calgary, partly because we don&#8217;t want conflict with existing teams.<br />
The obvious question you know have is: Am I moving to Toronto? Maybe. And that&#8217;s about the best answer I can currently offer. I knew about this plan weeks ago when we were working on the pitch document (see 5 August 2003), and my name was on the list for the Toronto office. This is for a number of reasons, but mostly because Di (who&#8217;s leading this project) knows that when the going gets tough, I don&#8217;t leave the office.<br />
There&#8217;s another reason other than my workaholism. I&#8217;ve been personally unable to choose between staying here in Calgary or going to Toronto. I&#8217;ve done the southern Ontario thing, so that in itself isn&#8217;t a draw for me. But the opportunities that might present themselves might be work the risk (if there is in fact any risk). So I decided that I needed the company&#8217;s opinion on where they wanted me most. Since Monday, I&#8217;ve heard answers all across the board, and no clear direction. They definitely ain&#8217;t making this easy for me.<br />
That other reason? When I talked with Cory, he mentioned that we&#8217;re going to have a hard time getting our team up to speed as quickly as possible. He wanted to see someone with experience that he could throw to the wolves and know that they&#8217;d have them tamed in due course. Jude and Colin have either not expressed an interest to go, or have said flat out that they don&#8217;t want to go. That leaves me as the only other Web Development Manager. And since my name is on the list already, that&#8217;s just an added benefit.<br />
Cory doesn&#8217;t want to see me go there for two years, though (the desired contracted time for anyone transferring to Toronto). Frankly, neither do I. Somehow, I&#8217;ve become oddly useful to a number of people and projects here, which is why I was having problems decide. (Allard, my boss, had expressed his opinion that I should stay.) Cory and I are already thinking that a shorter term, say six months, might be more appropriate. Sort of like the infamous Dilbert Bungee Boss.<br />
We found out today that the client is delaying their decision a month, so the earliest I&#8217;d be going is late October. (Although I will be in Toronto Sept. 18-20 for a job fair to find candidates for the job. Anyone interested in a job at Critical Mass?) There&#8217;s no guarantees of anything, so we&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.<br />
I spent most of the weekend thinking about how to handle this decision, and most of this week trying to figure out what the company wants. (But given the sheer chaos going on around here this week &#8212; several other clients have asked for the world by next week &#8212; I can totally understand getting mixed messages.)<br />
Back to Saturday, though. Greg eventually did call, having arrived in Calgary later than planned owing to heavier traffic than expected and far too many people at the McDonald&#8217;s and Tim Horton&#8217;s along the way. I felt pretty bad, because we&#8217;d loosely planned to do something when he got there, but with Stuart and Therese leaving, I wanted to see them as much as possible. (I didn&#8217;t get to see Therese that night, since she had to continue writing her PhD dissertation.) Greg, it seemed, was pretty keen on seeing a movie.<br />
Stuart, Greg, and I shared a pre-movie beverage at Eau Claire before heading in. The movie (S.W.A.T.) wasn&#8217;t exactly Oscar material, but I&#8217;ve seen worse this year. Stuart headed out after the movie, leaving Greg and I to continue our chat at the Barley Mill. It&#8217;s been a long time since Greg and I last had a good talk &#8212; in fact, it was almost a year ago (see 1 September 2002).<br />
The following morning was my first run with dim sum in about two months. Scheduling&#8217;s been a pain, and my weekends have been so busy that it just hasn&#8217;t been possible. But this could have been my last with Stuart and Therese, so I wanted to make the most of it.<br />
Greg and I hooked up later that afternoon, and opted for a drive out of town. (Mostly because Greg wanted to see what the Mini was like.) After grabbing coffee (for Greg) at Tim Horton&#8217;s, we headed west out to Bragg Creek, and then down to Elbow Falls. I had kind of expected it to be like the last time I was there (see 3 July 2001, Part 1) &#8212; a few people, and quiet. Instead, the entire area was full of people picnicing and jumping off the cliffs into the splash pool below.<br />
We wandered around a bit, discussing jobs, politics, cars, families, girlfriends (well, his anyway), and pretty much anything else that came to mind. Then it was back to the road. But this time, Greg drove. Greg wanted to see what a Mini was like on the road, and I trust Greg implicitly. (Although he does drive a little faster than I do&#8230;)<br />
As we bombed down Highway 22 towards Calgary, something floated into Greg&#8217;s head: Fubar. No, not that he was about to total my car, but the movie. (It&#8217;s an independant cult-level movie filmed in Alberta. It&#8217;s on Greg&#8217;s &#8220;Top 10 Movies That Changed My Life&#8221; list, next to &#8220;Scarface&#8221;.) Part of the movie takes place in a little town called High River. When I told Greg it was maybe 50 kms south of Calgary, he nearly lost control of the car:<br />
Greg: (Excitedly) [Censored] it! We&#8217;re goin&#8217;! (More calmly) Uh, do you mind?<br />
Me: (Not really caring, or fully understanding the desire.) Uh, okay&#8230;<br />
Greg: (Excitedly) [Censored] it! We&#8217;re goin&#8217;!<br />
Before long, we were in High River, searching for a building with a mural of buffalo being chased off a cliff. (Don&#8217;t ask. If you haven&#8217;t seen the movie, it doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense. I know because I haven&#8217;t seen the movie, either.) Greg was beside himself when we finally found it (didn&#8217;t take long &#8212; High River&#8217;s not that big). One day I will finally understand was the excitement was all about.<br />
Buying what I can only constitute as a &#8220;ceremonial&#8221; cube of Pilsner (a &#8220;cube&#8221; is the Albertan equivalent of an Ontario 2-4), we returned to Calgary and a late dinner, with what I can only describe as the best roast beef I think I&#8217;ve ever had. My father would have loved it.<br />
We parted ways later that night, not having run out of conversation topics or energy, but time. I had work the following day (I missed going to the gym due to lack of energy and sleep) and Greg had to drive to Edmonton the following day.<br />
I went to bed that night with many things floating around in my mind, most of them about what I would do without old friends. Makes me wonder what the next few weeks are going to bring.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite the plethora of forest fires plaguing the B.C. interior, my family decided it was a good weekend to dive into the (mostly) green forests of Banff National Park.<br />
Now you&#8217;re probably wondering why on Earth I noted forest fires in B.C. when Banff National Park is clearly in Alberta. Simply put: smoke travels. Calgary has had many hazy days as a result of all the fires, and my eyes have itched a fair amount due to airborne particulates. As we left the city, you couldn&#8217;t see the Rockies in the distance. It will be like this until the forest fires end.<br />
I started off my morning slapping another coat of paint around the windows. I came inside to prepare for the excursion only to find Miao-Yin had decided to lay waste to my couch with the former contents of her stomach. After vigourously repressing the urge to use her as a furry soccer ball (I banned her to the basement for the next 24 hours instead), I cleaned up the mess, then cleaned myself and gathered my photography equipment, finishing just as my family arrived to pick me up.<br />
Uncle Mike drove with Nana riding shotgun. I sat behind Mike; Mom behind Nana. Aunt Brenda, Maggie, and Jen took up the rear of the minivan. With the A/C on full blast (or so it felt), we took off for the trip into the mountains.<br />
Our first stop (not counting the raid of Robin&#8217;s Donuts to get a snack for the ride out) was at the Three Sisters Mountain Village. This is a new development project up the mountain slopes on the south-eastern edge of Canmore. This is a massive project &#8212; the Three Sisters bought up 1,800 acres of land, and portioned them out into lots for fairly expensive homes (condos starting at $250,000 and homes starting at around $400,000) to homes starting at 4,500 square feet (I don&#8217;t want to know the price). Naturally, the area is pockmarked with golf courses.<br />
The development is mostly to cater to those who want to live the Banff lifestyle, but can&#8217;t move into Banff (which has a limitation on development). While Canmore doesn&#8217;t lie within the boundaries of Banff National Park, the city council seems to have kept the general ideas in place. Canmore has yet to acquire a real &#8220;mall&#8221; of any kind.<br />
Sighing off the prices that none of us can (or will ever) afford, we proceeded to Banff. Or more specifically, to the line-up for Banff. Despite the haze brought on by forest fire smoke, a large number of Albertans and tourists alike were gathered at the park entrance to acquire their day passes. So naturally, we ended up in the slowest line.<br />
Mike and Brenda decided to renew their annual pass, and made quick work of the purchase. About a half hour after entering the line, we were pulling off for the Minnewanka Loop. The Minnewanka Loop is a road on the north side of the Trans-Canada Highway, across from Banff Townsite. The road is a several-kilometre loop up to Lake Minnewanka, across the retention dam, and eventually back around to the road you went up in the first place. It&#8217;s a nice ride, albeit curvy.<br />
Our first stop was at Lake Minnewanka, where we took a few moments to make use of facilities and take a look around. It&#8217;s a gorgeous little area &#8212; you can even take power and sailboats up there for a cruise around the lake. It&#8217;s a fairly large lake, too, so there&#8217;s a lot to see on water that you would have some trouble getting to on land.<br />
Some of the surrounding hills showed sign of forest fire. To keep Banff National Park (and other surrounding areas), conservationists started controlled fires to burn out some of the material most likely to burn. It&#8217;s a little unsightly, but helps with the forest life cycle and promotes new, healthy growth.<br />
One thing that&#8217;s been discovered in recent years is that, despite the obvious damage, forest fires are a necessary part of life in the forest. New growth can&#8217;t start in old growth forests. Although environmentalists cry out at the thought of burning an old forest (can&#8217;t say I blame &#8217;em, either), the canopies are often too dense to let light in to spur new trees. When the forests burn, the canopies are destroyed and nutrients (in the form of ash) are returned to the soil. Though it takes a few years, the resulting forest is just as strong and healthy as the previous one.<br />
As an additional note: logging does not appear to have the same benefits as burning.<br />
Anyway, we didn&#8217;t stick around too long at Minnewanka, as there was a severe lack of picnic tables. So we decided to head on down to Johnson Lake, in hopes of something there. The road was mostly empty, save for the odd car. Normally, the area would be full of campers. An influx of grizzly bears has put a stop to that for now.<br />
Johnson Lake was slowly beginning to fill up. We arrived early enough, however, to acquire a picnic table in the shade. Considering that it was quite warm outside, this was a definite benefit &#8230; the breeze that blew in off the lake also helped.<br />
The portable propane barbecue was set up (open fires are pretty much verboten throughout Western Canada at the moment) and lunch started while Jen and I went for a little wander around the area. The next time I go back, I&#8217;ll have to make sure to wear shoes (I was wearing sandals) and return when all the trails are reopened (closed either for safety reasons, specifically bears, or for environmental protection).<br />
The six of us sat under the trees, fending off the odd bee and trying to keep Maggie from barking at everyone or eating out of our hands. Aside from the nigh-indestructable table, the experience was pretty much prototypical picnic.<br />
Following our lunch (the table was open for all of 10 seconds before another family swooped in on it), we headed out for Banff Townsite. Like the picnic area we had just left, Banff (Bamf!) was full of people and cars. (Although we managed to get a parking spot on Banff Ave.) Such was to begin our afternoon of shopping.<br />
There&#8217;s only one thing that will truly keep me from shopping: other people. And I&#8217;m not referring to too many other people &#8212; shopping in crowded malls (especially during Christmas) has always been a fun thing to do. The problem wasn&#8217;t mine, so much as it was Nana&#8217;s and Mom&#8217;s. They&#8217;re not exactly the Andretti brothers when it comes to walking down crowded sidewalks. And with the heat, Mom&#8217;s mobility wasn&#8217;t exactly stellar.<br />
Much to Jen&#8217;s dismay, we made it only down one side of the street before calling off the shopping spree. Nana was the only purchaser. We had debated on going to the Banff Springs for a drink on the patio. Then it was the Rose and Crown in Canmore, as there would be far less tourists there. But as we approached Canmore, we decided it was better to have drinks in Calgary.<br />
I fell asleep on the way home. I guess I&#8217;d had too much mountain air for one day. (And I had woken early to tackle some house painting.) I snapped out of my slumber at the Calgary city limits.<br />
That night, my family feasted on Thai from the King and I. What amazed me, at first anyway, was that Mom was keen on trying it. But somehow, it hadn&#8217;t registered with her that &#8220;Thai&#8221; was Asian. And Mom&#8217;s not a big fan of Asian foods. She did eat some of it, though.<br />
That was my Saturday. I can sum up Sunday in one word: Painting.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The weekend past was the August long weekend. Well, it was the long weekend for most people. For me, it was one of three things: painting the house, spending time with family, or being at work.<br />
Four things, if you count sleeping.<br />
Mom arrived in town Wednesday afternoon. Her arrival was what had fuelled my desire to paint the house. The idea was to have the whole thing painted in time for her arrival. Yeah, my ambition&#8217;s pretty sizeable. I figure: Go big, or go home. I might have made it, had it not been for a couple of work-related things that came up and threw me off-target for time.<br />
Wednesday night I spent with Mom, Aunt Brenda, and my cousin Jen. Thursday night was here at the office, dealing with project work. For the first time since I started doing overtime at Critical Mass (on my second day on the job &#8212; see [[My First Entry from Critical Mass]]), I wasn&#8217;t programming. I was doing the things I used to do before I came to Critical Mass: document editing and formatting (and a little writing and editing).<br />
What was I working on? We&#8217;re doing the single largest pitch in the history of Critical Mass. And I can&#8217;t tell you who it&#8217;s for, so don&#8217;t ask. All I can tell you is that if we do win it, the contract will fundamentally change Critical Mass. It&#8217;s that big.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Aren&#8217;t I Mercedes-Benz Boy? I&#8217;m still working on our single largest account, no worries about that. But it&#8217;s been a slow year for us, and I had the opportunity to contribute. I also offered to assist with the document construction.<br />
Why did I do that? Well, for those of you who know what I used to do, it&#8217;s probably a bit of a surprise. For those of you who don&#8217;t, allow me to tell you why I&#8217;m a web developer. After graduating university, I became a Technical Writer (something I&#8217;d started doing on co-op work terms). I did technical writing for six years in total. Towards the end, I hated it so much I sometimes felt like a coyote caught in a trap, and wanted to gnaw my own hands off.<br />
While at Radical Entertainment, I started pushing myself more towards web development. I&#8217;d already been doing it for a number of years, so it wasn&#8217;t that big a stretch. Owing to a need to leave Vancouver, I came here. Based on a recommendation from my friend Scott, I applied at Critical Mass and the rest is history. But what isn&#8217;t commonly known is that while I was waiting for word from Critical Mass about my position, I was actively avoiding several technical writing positions.<br />
That&#8217;s how much this pitch means to Critical Mass. That&#8217;s how much I was driven to go back to doing what I used to do. That&#8217;s how I ended up in the office on Thursday night, most of Saturday, and all of Monday (8:00 to well after 22:00).<br />
That&#8217;s how I remembered how much I hate Microsoft Word.<br />
Friday night was the first of what will likely be many family dinners while Mom is out visiting. (Not that I&#8217;m complaining in any way.) But it was Saturday that was the big event &#8212; the birthday party for my Aunt Brenda. I won&#8217;t tell you how old she is, but it&#8217;s the one that causes people to put 50 pink flamingos on your front lawn.<br />
It was supposed to be a surprise party. It was supposed to be a grand little affair where we get her to scream in delight, etc. But I seem the only living person in my family able to organize these things without the guests of honour finding out. Aunt Brenda almost planned her entire party. Were it not for me being a royal pain-the-ass, she would have spent a good portion of it in the kitchen preparing food. I started banning her from the kitchen.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t easy, either. Aunt Brenda&#8217;s kitchen is a magnet for her. Every time I turned my back, she was back in there. I actually uttered: &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me come in there!&#8221;<br />
She did.<br />
I ended up finally kicking her out and handling the things she would have done, like making the best darn corn bread on the planet. It&#8217;s a heart attack in a pan, but it&#8217;s worth the potential coronary. I have *got* to get that recipe one of these days.<br />
The next day, I woke up a little early (for a weekend) to resume painting. It&#8217;s finally cooled off a bit, and it allowed me to tackle painting the front of the house &#8212; the only side I wanted to do before Mom saw the house. (I still have to do the west wall, but you can&#8217;t see it unless you&#8217;re in my neighbour&#8217;s yard.) I even got several of the windows finished up.<br />
Painting a house can be a bit of a Zen thing. (&#8220;Zen and the Art of Decorative Trim&#8221;?) I&#8217;ve had several people tell me that it might be great to have tunes blaring while slapping down a coat of paint. I have yet to have a radio turned on. And when I&#8217;m using the paint sprayer, I can&#8217;t hear anything else.<br />
House painting, in some ways, returns you to your youth. Especially when you use latex paints. It doesn&#8217;t stick to glass, plastic, or skin. It makes you feel like that creepy kid in second grade who put Elmer&#8217;s Glue all over their hands so they could peel it off like a layer of skin. It&#8217;s especially fun in the shower. Doesn&#8217;t matter how dried the paint is &#8212; a little warm water and soap, and *poof* there&#8217;s a clump of sloughed-off paint skin on the shower floor.<br />
Mom, Aunt Brenda, and Jen appeared around 14:00. Mom was being dropped off while the other two checked out &#8220;Johnny English&#8221;. Mom, Tamara and I chatted in the backyard for a while, listening to some jerk across the alley scream his head off at another tenant about unpaid bills and broken windows. It was an argument I wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in listening to, but had little choice.<br />
Mom half-guilted me into cleaning up the yard a bit while we sat out back. Mostly cutting back all the suckers growing from two trees and the lilac bush. Admittedly, though, it did look better. Then it was back to painting.<br />
As Sunday was Aunt Brenda&#8217;s actual birthday, we all went out for dinner at a nice homey Italian restaurant along 17th Ave., Buon Giorno. Definitely not the swankiest restaurant in Calgary, but they make a good meal. Try the scallops &#8212; their chef cooks them to absolute perfection.<br />
My cell phone rang at 7:33 Monday morning. It was Chicago. Although I&#8217;d been on call all weekend, this was *the* call I&#8217;d been expecting. I was in the office 10 minutes later and editing. I had hoped to paint that morning. No matter. The worst that would happen was I&#8217;d be editing until 16:00, at which time the documents were off to Kinko&#8217;s for copying.<br />
Or at least that&#8217;s what I thought.<br />
The morning was sheer chaos and panic, especially when I saw the state of the appendix. It would take a phone call with Heather to put my mind at ease, especially when I realized that not everything in the appendix was supposed to be formatted.<br />
More problems with Word trying to do things I didn&#8217;t want it to do. These are problems that Microsoft has never removed. And before you go saying: &#8220;Must be a problem with the user&#8221;, when I first detected them with Word 97, I stumped the tech support guys in Redmond, WA who were unable to solve the problem. You&#8217;d think after six years, they&#8217;d fix the damn thing.<br />
Final call came sometime after 22:00 last night. I was tired. I hadn&#8217;t felt that tired as a result of office work in a very long time. But the pitch is off to the hopeful client-to-be. Now we just have to wait a half a month to find out if they want to take us to the second round or not. I hope there&#8217;s not as much pressure as the first round.<br />
My idea of pressure on the second round is the kind sealed by bottle cap.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I need a weekend from my weekend. &#8216;Course, it&#8217;s my fault for trying to do so much at once.<br />
For the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been preparing to paint my house. (The outside, that is.) I should have painted it last year, as my home inspector suggested (see [[Meeting with the Home Inspector]]), but I had a few things that kinda got in the way ([[Moving into my New (Old) House|moving into the house]], [[My Housewarming Party|my housewarming party]], [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding|a wedding]], and the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC 50th Anniversary train</a>). By the time I could have done it, the weather was too cold.<br />
Once the roof was reshingled (an expensive but necessary repair), I set down to start painting. I didn&#8217;t have to strip all the paint off, but I did have to remove paint from around the windows and the front door. Most of it had disintegrated and really needed to be replaced. The rest I can paint over.<br />
Weather and a few too many activities last week delayed my start, which I pegged as Saturday. However, I had forgotten about one little detail: I&#8217;d already promised to help my friends Fritz and Jin move into their new condo.<br />
This, I might add, I was more than happy to do. Fritz had helped me move last year ([[Moving into my New (Old) House]]), so this was my turn. Luckily, Fritz didn&#8217;t have anything truly awkward (except maybe the futon), so it was just a matter of hauling things around. There were five of us actually moving things: Fritz, Doug, Adrian, Godfrey, and myself. Jin was still frantically packing when I arrived just after 9:00.<br />
Fritz appeared minutes after me, carrying breakfast. (Had I known, I wouldn&#8217;t have hit Tim Horton&#8217;s before coming over.) Scarfing down a sausage McMuffin and a hashbrown, we proceeded to cart down boxes, tables, cabinets, beds (in pieces, of course), sheets of glass (from the tables), chairs, bags of who-knows-what, candlesticks (big ones), lights, paintings &#8230; we wouldn&#8217;t taken the doors, the toilet, and the kitchen sink if we could have gotten away with them.<br />
The hardest part of moving is going out. Because everything is spread out, it&#8217;s hard to gauge how much room they&#8217;ll take in the truck. Although Fritz had rented a medium-sized U-Haul, it wasn&#8217;t immediately clear how well everything would fit. Having moved too many times for my own good, I was confident that we&#8217;d get everything there in one trip.<br />
Slowly, but sure, the truck began to fill up. Godfrey had brought his pick-up truck, which would end up carrying a spare bed and a bicycle. Adrian&#8217;s Golf carried the TV and the computer. My Mini carried the glass from the tables. The truck was filled quite well, but far from capacity. We could have quite easily packed in many more things, but ultimately there was no need for such efficiency. Besides, Fritz and Jin don&#8217;t have that much stuff.<br />
(In fact, that ended up being a debate: who had more stuff in their move? Tamara and myself, or Fritz and Jin? We couldn&#8217;t decide.)<br />
The new condo is quite literally that &#8212; new. In fact, it&#8217;s still being finished. The condo was supposed to be ready last year. An accident set off one of the largest fires seen in Calgary, destroying most of the complex, and damaging a few units that had been finished years earlier. (Critical Mass&#8217; HR director fled home when she found out to save her cat. Luckily, her unit was spared damage.)<br />
The smell of fresh paint, carpet adhesive, and fresh-cut wood permeated the air. Banging could be heard from nearly every direction. (The crews have been working non-stop to finish the condos.) Our first obstacle was finding a place to park &#8212; the streets around Fritz and Jin&#8217;s condo were littered with construction vehicles. We ended up in a no-park zone.<br />
Next obstacle: stairs. There were no ramps, no direct access to the lobby. The architects weren&#8217;t particularly bright on that point, in my opinion. Lucky, nothing was particularly heavy. All we had to do was reverse the process (significantly easier) and move everything into the condo.<br />
Unpacking the trucks and cars would have taken less time than packing, were it not for the stairs and an elevator that were &#8220;in the way&#8221;. But even with that and Godfrey&#8217;s early departure, we still finished the move in about four hours. There was only one causality, a floor lamp that appeared to have had the threads stripped from one of its joints. (The lamp still works.)<br />
The move over, Fritz returned the U-Haul, and we headed over to Fujiyama for a post-move meal. Adrian, Doug, Fritz and Jin would return to the condo to sort out the contents. I, however, had a house to paint. Or more specifically, needed to get supplies with which to paint.<br />
Luckily, I knew what I wanted. Basic white paint, a can of green for accents, a couple of brushes, and a paint gun. Yeah, I know &#8212; what do I really need a paint gun for? Why not use brushes, right? Well, considering the amount of painting that I&#8217;ll need to do on a (semi-)regular basis, I think the cost of the paint gun will far outweigh the time I&#8217;d have to spend painting by hand. And it&#8217;ll save wrist strain.<br />
One other thing that I needed to get, which I determined after an inability to borrow one from someone, was a power washer. Every single site I read and every person I talked to said that I had to wash my house before applying the paint, otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t stick as well. Trips to Wal-Mart and Canadian Tire revealed models running from $129 to over $800. I settled for a little 1200 PSI Karcher.<br />
Rent? Oh yeah, I could have definitely rented both. But I&#8217;d have paid for it in the long run. The paint gun would have run me up quickly, to the point where I&#8217;d have paid more for renting than for owning. As for the power washer, the only rentals were gas-powered monsters that could strip not only the paint but probably some of the wood. (For the record, 1200 PSI is *plenty* for washing dirt, etc. from a house.)<br />
Changing into my painting clothes, I set about to wash down the house and prepare to start painting the next day. For the next three or so hours, I proceeded to get very wet and very dirty. I had paint chips, dirt, insect carcases, water (of course), and Heaven-knows-what-else rain down on me as I removed all the gunk the house has been collecting since the last time someone took the time to do the job. I&#8217;m reasonably certain it wasn&#8217;t the last owner.<br />
With the house dripping wet, there was nothing I could do until the next morning. Tired from a day of moving and cleaning, I opted for a steak dinner. On my way to the store, I felt the need to obtain a cold beverage with which to relax. Imagine my shock and delight when, wedged next to Sleeman&#8217;s Honey Brown, I found the long-missed lime-green packaging of Steam Whistle Pilsner. Life was definitely getting better.<br />
Originally planning to rise at 8:00, I evicted myself from bed around 9:00, opting for an extra hour of rest. Saturday still had me worn out, and I had a long day ahead of me.<br />
Task #1: Read the instructions for the paint gun. The last thing I want to do is screw the thing up. With the early morning, it was an ideal time to try and paint a portion of the house not easily seen &#8212; the north cupola (containing the bathroom) wall. This requires me to climb onto the roof on my fancy-schmancy ladder. (It bends in three places to help me do just what I was trying to do.)<br />
This is when I found out just how steep my roof is, and how there was no way I would have been able to reshingle the roof on my own. In fact, the roof is so steep that I couldn&#8217;t even climb off the ladder (which bent onto the roof) and climb up on my own. The shingles don&#8217;t help &#8212; they&#8217;re flat so there&#8217;s no grit on which to gain a foothold. I only managed to paint part of the small wall. As it was more a test than a task, I didn&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
As a result of my resounding non-success, I realized that I needed a paint roller to reach the more inaccessible areas. Either that, or mountaineering gear so I could climb up the side of my roof. Either, I resolved to paint the rest later.<br />
The rising sun prevented me from tackling the rear or east walls. (I&#8217;m leaving the west wall for sometime later, when there&#8217;s less pressure. You can&#8217;t see it unless you go into my neighbour&#8217;s yard, anyway.) I wasn&#8217;t too keen on doing the front of the house until I had a little more practice with the gun. I decided to give the stripped windows their first shot of green paint.<br />
About 11:30, I broke for a shower. Nana had invited me to the grand opening of her condo complex in the north end of town, and I wasn&#8217;t about to show up looking like I&#8217;d just done battle against a flock of birds with the runs.<br />
Nana lives in a retirement complex. Basically, an apartment building for people with not as much mobility as they once had. The amenities include a cafeteria (with pretty decent food, I&#8217;m told), nice views of a small man-made lake, exercise room, library, theatre (and a darn nice one, at that), and a wonderful little courtyard. The complex is next to a new strip-mall that has an IGA, various little shops, and 17 food service establishments.<br />
Nana fed me lunch. It was supposed to be a BLT, but I don&#8217;t like raw T. In fact, I can&#8217;t stand &#8217;em. I can eat T any other way, just not raw. So I had a BLC (cheese). It was still yummy.<br />
The party started around 13:00, and we hung around for about 45 minutes. It seemed to be little more than just a gathering. There seemed to be no official announcements, or greetings, or ceremony of any kind. Nana opted to give me the guided tour of the facilities in lieu of waiting around for something that didn&#8217;t seem to be happening.<br />
We ended up at the balcony at the end of her hallway, just down from her apartment. The balcony looks north across the lake. It&#8217;s a wonderful view, even if it is towards another complex being built on the north side of the lake. We sat and talked for almost an hour before I took my leave to resume my house painting.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t go right home &#8212; I made a stop by Revy to pick up the paint roller, tray, and an extension so I could reach those hard-to-reach places. I didn&#8217;t even get in the main entrance when my cell phone rang. It was my friend (and realtor) Robyn. Robyn has taken it upon herself (bless the woman) to be a matchmaker, and I&#8217;m her latest project.<br />
It was a set-up. I knew it was. Just like Thursday night, when we&#8217;d met for drinks down at the Barley Mill. Unlike that time, however, plans were fairly definite: a movie at 19:05 where I&#8217;d meet Robyn&#8217;s mysterious woman. (We have talked on the phone &#8212; an impromptu Robyn set-up, when we were at the pub.) Although it was a movie I&#8217;d already seen, I figured that I&#8217;d like to meet this woman, I could stand to get out for a while, and besides &#8212; &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; is actually a pretty good movie.<br />
Back at the ranch, I unpacked my newly-gotten booty, and got on with the show. The east wall was now in the shade, leaving me to start painting. I opted for the middle third of the wall, which is the section the cupola runs off of. The rollers helped me get the very top, which even my rather-long step ladder can&#8217;t reach. Of course, I got almost as much paint on me as I did on the wall and overhang.<br />
Reaching the level, it was time for me to change and prepare for the movie. (Note: I do not use the word &#8220;date&#8221;. It was a group event, as to remove any pressure.) Just as I was about to walk out the door for the trip up, my phone rang. It was Robyn. It appeared that my mystery woman had developed car trouble, and had decided not to go. This pretty much eliminated my desire to go out, since I could finish more painting.<br />
When I explained to Robyn that I&#8217;d rather paint, she was disappointed. But when I mentioned that I&#8217;d already seen the movie, she squealed in delight. I was willing to go see a movie I&#8217;d already seen just so I could meet a girl! I suddenly felt like I was in high school again. (Of course, this sort of thing *never* happened to me in high school.)<br />
Back into my painting gear, I tackled the rest of the east wall, and slid around to the east side of the south wall. I shut down the paint gun for the night after that. Although very fast, it&#8217;s quiet noisy and would probably bother my neighbours. I opted to give the windows a second coat of green, and apply a first coat to the window sills on the east wall.<br />
The sunlight gone along with the remainder of my energy, I went for a late dinner. I already knew that today was going to be rough. My arms are sore (from holding a fully-extended paint roller at a distance), my feet are killing me (standing on ladders), and I&#8217;ve got paint edged under every fingernail.<br />
And I&#8217;ve still got about 3/4 of a house to paint.</p>
