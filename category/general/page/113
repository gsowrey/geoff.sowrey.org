	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend, I did something a little different than usual. I went to Calgary.<br />
Alone.<br />
Well, not totally alone. I went to visit Stuart, who I had only seen for a whopping six hours at Christmas. Ideally, I would have also visited Therese, but she was off in Halifax on a conference, and visiting her sister. Also visiting that weekend was Jay, one of Stuart&#8217;s friends from college, whom I had come to know quite well.<br />
It was becoming the &#8220;Boy&#8217;s Weekend&#8221;.<br />
The original intention behind all this was to get together to work on a script that Stuart and Jay had been working on extensively, that I had started to contribute to a few months ago. The weekend happened to coincide with the release of Star Wars: Episode 1. Lucky us.<br />
When I arrived at Gate C34 at the airport, I noticed that there was a significantly larger number of people than there should be for a a flight not due to board for 40 minutes, let alone depart for an hour. It turned out that the flight before mine (also going to Calgary) was late.<br />
Quickly deducing that my flight would be late arriving in Calgary, I decided to try playing my cards. I walked up to the desk and asked one of the two attendants if the flight leaving was full. When she told me it wasn&#8217;t, I asked if it was possible to change my flight from the 19:40 flight to the 18:30 flight (it ended up being the 19:00 by the time it actually got going).<br />
A few minutes later, I was seated next to a window, waiting to get moving.<br />
Luckily for me, timing was everything that evening. Jay arrived a couple of hours ahead of me, so he and Stuart had gone out for dinner. Arriving early, I attempted to call Stuart&#8217;s thinking he might be there. He wasn&#8217;t. My next task was to have him paged.<br />
A moment after the page went out, I saw Jay and Stuart walking across the baggage claim floor. The weekend had begun.<br />
We retreated to Stuart&#8217;s apartment and watched &#8220;Empire Strikes Back&#8221;, after engaging in a debate about where John Ratzenberger (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) appears in the movie. We were unsuccessful in our search. (Apparently he&#8217;s a Rebel &#8212; I mistakenly thought he was an Imperial.)<br />
The following morning, we headed out into the partially cloudy and somewhat rainy Calgary. Following breakfast at Denny&#8217;s (which left Jay and I feeling a bit odd for most of the day), we traipsed about the downtown before finally ending up at Eau Claire Market, where we indulged ourselves on video games. We were killing time. We were seeing Star Wars that night, so we couldn&#8217;t really go anywhere without coming back late.<br />
After a very small lunch, a couple of beers, and an IMAX movie later, we headed out towards the south end of Calgary. You really get an idea of how big Calgary actually is when you find it takes almost an hour to get from downtown to the south end. (Of course, we were driving through rush hour traffic, so that&#8217;s to be somewhat expected.)<br />
We were not alone in our vigil &#8212; several of Stuart and Therese&#8217;s friends were also attending the affair.<br />
We lined up just before 8pm in anticipation of the 10:10pm show. And just so you&#8217;re aware, there were others in the line before us &#8212; we weren&#8217;t the most desperate.<br />
The atmosphere once we got into the theatre was like waiting for a concert to start. Lots of talking and laughing &#8230; even a beach ball that was flung around the room (at least until the management took it away; we booed the usher for ruining our fun).<br />
It was an odd feeling, watching a new Star Wars movie. I couldn&#8217;t honestly tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen the original trilogy. We&#8217;ll just leave at &#8220;a lot&#8221;. We actually had to read the introductory text as it scrolled by. Our excitement was uncontrolled because, as Stuart put it, we didn&#8217;t know exactly what was going to happen in the next moment.<br />
A little over two hours later, we emerged from the theatre, mostly wired from some of the things we had seen. It was a good introduction to a long story (something that a lot of people were forgetting), with a lot of great action. We dreamed of many a lightsabre duel that night&#8230;<br />
The following morning, we decided we would head into the mountains. Jay had never been to the mountains, and wanted to see them up close. The weather was good, so we opted to take the day amongst the snowy caps of the Rockies.<br />
Before leaving Calgary, we picked up a friend of Jay&#8217;s who had moved to Calgary a year earlier, Kevin. Stuart knew Kevin through Jay, so I became the odd person out. Luckily, Kevin and I got along well, so it was a briefly-felt feeling.<br />
Following a quick lunch at Pete&#8217;s Drive-In, we hauled the hour and a half into the mountains. Jay (who had bought a camera that morning so he could take pictures) almost sounded like a little kid as he clicked away with his camera, recording the imagery for posterity.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Banff, although we were going first to Lake Lorna. Kevin quickly asked if any of us have been to Morraine Lake, to which the three of us all replied &#8220;no&#8221;. A third destination was added to the list.<br />
As we drove along, we discussed a great many things, including the things we would do once we finally got to Banff. We even discussed the pronounciation of Banff. Technically, it is &#8220;banff&#8221;. It quickly degraded to &#8220;bamf&#8221;. One of us saying &#8220;banff&#8221; or &#8220;bamf&#8221; was followed by three &#8220;bamf&#8221;s.<br />
Guys do weird things. Accept it.<br />
On the way to Morraine Lake, we noticed something. Snow. Yeah, I know, that sounds really dumb. But there was a lot more snow up there than we expected. This led to, of course, a snowball fight.<br />
It was short-lived (snowballs are really cold on unprotected hands).<br />
For those of you who don&#8217;t remember Morraine Lake (and yes, all you Canadians have seen it before), find an old CDN$20 bill. Flip it over. Voila! Morraine Lake. Didn&#8217;t even know it was that close to Lake Louise.<br />
The snow there was pretty deep, almost burying the sign that describes the significance of the area. Luckily, a lot of people had been there before us, so we could walk across the snow without falling in. This was a good thing for me, because in all my haste to pack for Calgary, I forgot to bring shoes. All I had were my sandals.<br />
Of course, this didn&#8217;t stop me from doing dumb things, like climbing the rock pile at the head of the lake with Stuart, Jay, and Kevin. (Luckily, I have good sandals that grip almost anything, and the rocks were bare.)<br />
I was strange seeing Lake Louise again. The last time was a year and a half ago, when Gerry and I had stopped off on our way to Vancouver. Snow covered most of the mountains around the lake, and the lake itself still bore a sheet of ice. I felt sorry for Jay, not being able to witness the greeny-blue lake for himself.<br />
We wandered about the Chateau for a while, debated on crashing a wedding (again, it&#8217;s a guy thing; but don&#8217;t worry, we wouldn&#8217;t actually do such a thing &#8230; without good reason, that is), and eventually left for Banff (bamf).<br />
The townsite of Banff (bamf) hadn&#8217;t changed much in the year since I last visited (with Allison). After Stuart pulled into a well-hidden free parking spot (something that I wish I&#8217;d seen before), we proceeded to invade the downtown.<br />
It seems that Banff (bamf) was also invaded by a squadron of Air Cadets &#8212; they were everywhere. On every corner, and usually scattered about the middle of each block. It almost seemed Dickensian; I expected to see a military Fagin lurking around the corners.<br />
We wandered up Banff (bamf) Ave. towards the Park Administration building, then came down the other side. We stopped into various shops, but I abstained from buying anything &#8212; nothing there that really interested me. Jay and Kevin got sucked into a fudge shop where they indulged their sweet teeth. Tasty stuff, but it made my incisors vibrate.<br />
Finally, it was time for dinner (we really hadn&#8217;t eaten yet), so we headed towards St. James Gate, an Irish pub that Stuart recommended. As we headed over, we realised that we weren&#8217;t too far from Banff&#8217;s (bamf) movie theatre.<br />
It was playing Star Wars.<br />
They still had tickets.<br />
We figured popcorn would tie us over until we could get something else later.<br />
Emerging two hours later, hopped up on a heap of adrenaline from the lightsabre duels (yeah, we focused on that a lot), we went to dinner. A nice lamb stew and an Irish ale really hit the spot.<br />
After dinner, we ended up having to make a hard decision. Banff (bamf) is a great place to have fun. We thought we might stay the night, grab a hotel, and drive back in the morning. But then the little party-pooper in me thought about the plans for the next day &#8212; Drumheller. Driving from Banff (bamf) to Calgary and then to Drumheller wasn&#8217;t exactly something I wanted to do. It seemed it wasn&#8217;t something Stuart or Jay wanted to do either.<br />
The next time we&#8217;re in Banff (bamf), we&#8217;re spending the night, even if it means eight people crammed into a room.<br />
We arrived in Calgary an hour later, initially at a loss for something to do. We ended up downtown at a pub called &#8220;The Barley Mill&#8221;, where we swapped jokes, movie quotes, and work-related annoyances, quaffed a couple pints, and listened to some really great jazz.<br />
We got up a bit later the next morning, showered, hit Safeway to get hot dogs and buns, and headed out to Drumheller. I hadn&#8217;t been to Drumheller before, and really wanted to know what that area of Alberta was like. Jay hadn&#8217;t been there before either (he hadn&#8217;t been to Alberta before), and was excited about the Royal Tyrell Museum of Palaeontology.<br />
It was a long drive. At least, it felt like a long drive. In reality, it probably wasn&#8217;t anything overly lengthy, but the heat and lack of features (it is the Prairies, after all) made it seem longer. Finally, the flatness gave way to an almost Grand Canyon-like valley (albeit significantly shallower), and the city of Drumheller.<br />
Drumheller is one of these strange cities that base their entire existence on one thing. Usually, that one thing is a resource (i.e. a mine). In this case, it&#8217;s dinosaurs. I&#8217;m really curious to know what would happen to Drumheller if the Tyrell had been built somewhere else.<br />
Our first stop was at McMullen Island, a small park where we had lunch. Then it was off to stare at Mr. T-Rex.<br />
I&#8217;ve been to a few museums now in Alberta, and I will say that they have some of the best ones I&#8217;ve ever been to. It&#8217;s really quite impressive. It&#8217;s not just a few piles of bones for you to stare at &#8212; they purposely lead you through exhibits leading to the rise of the dinosaur. Finally, by the time you reach the actual exhibits, you understand why the dinosaurs came to be.<br />
The museum works of the theory of evolution. You start with the single-celled organisms, progressing to the primitive ocean life. Then it&#8217;s on to the first plants on land, followed by the first land creatures. You start seeing the proto-dinosaurs, finally landing in a large room full of T-Rexes, triceratops, and Albertosauri.<br />
But the exhibits do not stop there &#8212; they continue on the evolution through the extinction of the dinosaur and rise of the mammal. They show you the birth of the sabre-toothed cats, the mammoths, and then take you to the ultimate mammal exhibit &#8230; the gift shop. Think about it &#8212; where else can you see the ultimate mammal in their natural environment?<br />
Returning to the outside, we wandered about the trails near the museum, looking at the rock strata that form the valley the museum sits in, the strata that contains the bones of dinosaurs appearing in the museum. Before hitting the trails, though, we endulged on some frozen treats to try and counteract the 30-someodd degree heat.<br />
A few times, as we walked about the rolling hills, we could hear good ol&#8217; Prairie Silence. For those of you who haven&#8217;t visited the Prairies and parked yourself in the middle of nowhere, isolated from the machines that make the noise we hear every day of our lives, you&#8217;ll never really know what it was like 100 years ago. The silence is truly deafening. (For reference, the only place I&#8217;ve ever been that was quieter was 150 feet below ground in a cave.)<br />
A short drive east from Drumheller took us to the Hoodoos. These are short clumps of rocks that have crowns. The crowns are make from less-soluable rock; they remain mostly untouched while the rocks beneath erode away. It makes for an interesting sight.<br />
Stuart, Jay, and I (mostly Jay and I) hiked to the top of the hill to see what we could see. There&#8217;s a lot out there.<br />
Another thing there was a lot of was sun &#8212; and I got a lot of it. Luckily, not so much to get a sun burn, but enough that my skin felt warm to the touch (even in the shade), and I really wished I had brought sun screen.<br />
Coming down the hill was a little harder than going up. Trying not to lose one&#8217;s footing when wearing sandals is a bit of a challenge, especially when the ground is crumbly. I slid a short distance down the slope, but quickly regained by footing.<br />
We stopped briefly at the Rosedale Suspension Bridge, put in place by the Star Mine company. The mines closed down in the 50&#8217;s, but the bridge continues to draw tourists. Rebuilt a few times since it&#8217;s original installation, the Suspension Bridge now features sturdy wooden towers and a steel grate floor.<br />
After stopping briefly to obtain liquid refreshment (we were quite thirsty by that point), we headed back towards Calgary. The drive back was surprisingly faster than the drive out, despite the fact that we ended up at the south end of the city, and had to travel for about 10 minutes along the Trans Canada to get back in.<br />
Stuart drove through the north of Calgary on our way back to his apartment, allowing me to see what the outskirts of the city look like. I cannot understand why anyone would want to live that far out. You might as well be living in High River for Airdale for all it really matters.<br />
We rented a movie (Rocketman &#8230; a surprisingly funny movie) and ordered Chinese. After the movie ended, we went out for a walk to a local sports bar, where we dove back into the movie script again.<br />
On the following morning, we headed out in search of Darth Maul action figures. Unfortunately, a few million people got there ahead of us. Both Toys &#8216;R Us and the Zellers we checked (not to mention the Bay) had their stocks depleted. Not a total surprise&#8230;<br />
Stuart took us downtown to his office, to show off his little piece of the advertising world. His company (Parallel) does some pretty amazing stuff &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s office is plastered with a lot of that amazing work. There are people whose abilities impress me &#8230; Stuart&#8217;s talent just plain frightens me.<br />
I remember his work when I was in high school. When I look back on his cartoony past and then look at the work he produces now, I admittedly get envious. He&#8217;s done very well on his skill, and it&#8217;s brought him many good things.<br />
We drove around Calgary for a little while, fairly aimlessly (we weren&#8217;t in any rush to go anywhere). We drove by Big Rock Brewery, for whom Stuart had done quite a bit of work. (Those of you in the Calgary area might see the billboards for &#8220;Kold&#8221; or the new Big Rock Brewery trucks with the beer bottles on the side &#8230; that&#8217;s Stuart&#8217;s handiwork.)<br />
At least some people get to see their work on public display. (For the record, Jay&#8217;s working on a kid&#8217;s cartoon show. He&#8217;ll get to see his work on TV.)<br />
As we began to drift in the direction of the airport, a sudden pang of guilt began to wash over me. In the hectic flow of the weekend, I had neglected to contact my relatives. As we were in the north-east anyway, I asked if we could quickly pop by my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home.<br />
I had been there twice before. I knew roughly where it was. But where I couldn&#8217;t remember the exact road to take us into their subdivision, Stuart did. He&#8217;d been there once.<br />
Stuart&#8217;s got a good road memory. (It also helps that he lives in the same city, and IKEA&#8217;s in the same area.)<br />
I got lucky, catching them after they had arrived home from camping. From Drumheller. The previous day. It&#8217;s truly a wonder that we didn&#8217;t run into each other over the course of the day.<br />
We talked for a while, while Jay put Maggie (my aunt and uncle&#8217;s dalmatian) into total submission. Jay&#8217;s got a way with dogs. Jennifer (my cousin) came tearing through the room at one point. She was about a foot taller than the last time I&#8217;d seen her, with shorter hair, and new braces. She smiled, said &#8220;Hi&#8221;, and then tore back out of the room.<br />
<em>Sigh.</em> I remember being that age.<br />
Before long, we had to leave, and headed to the airport. Jay&#8217;s flight was before mine, and we didn&#8217;t want him to miss it. My flight wasn&#8217;t for an hour after his, so I would have time to kill.<br />
We bade Jay farewell as he disappeared behind the security wall and eventually onto Toronto. Stuart and I turned to dinner at the Harvey&#8217;s, before it was my turn to depart.<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to friends, especially those that mean a lot in your life.<br />
Hopefully, I&#8217;ll see more of my friends this summer. Exactly when I&#8217;ll see them is a completely different issue. But with luck, it&#8217;ll happen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s finally happened. I guess it was only a matter of time. Allison and I are going to prison.<br />
Specifically, the grounds of the former Oakalla Prison Farm, about a kilometre east of where we&#8217;re living now. We&#8217;re moving to a new apartment.<br />
This all started some time ago, when we came to the conclusion that our current apartment wasn&#8217;t quite living up to our needs &#8212; specifically, we desperately need a dishwasher, and would certainly find in-suite laundry useful.<br />
Our building has some quirks, namely all the services shut down at 10pm. This is a minor problem when you realise you&#8217;re out of clothes at 9:00 at night (yes, this has happened before).<br />
No, our kitchen does not shut down at 10pm, nor does the hot water shut off. However, we spend untold hours washing dishes. It&#8217;s become a nuisance in the grand scheme of wanting to go out and do things, not to mention the toll on my poor hands.<br />
It also doesn&#8217;t help that our dish rack began to fall apart last night.<br />
On Saturday morning, as we lazed about the apartment, Allison started perusing the classifieds (she will read most of the newspaper), and started reading off available apartments. I&#8217;ve been relatively content with the apartment, but Allison&#8217;s wanted something better for a while now. (Actually, that&#8217;s a really long story, which will eventually finish with us living on English Bay, but I&#8217;m not getting into that now.) I, of course, am always open to suggestions. (Hey, no snickering out there!)<br />
Allison&#8217;s pass through the paper led to a couple of possibilities, none of which were available for viewing. Giving it my best shot, I came across the entry: &#8220;Oaklands area. 6 appls, f/p, prkng&#8221;. Not a lot to go on, but I figured I&#8217;d give it a shot. We went over to take a look about an hour later.<br />
The Oakalla Prison Farm closed in 1990, after the site was deemed inappropriate for use (it was falling apart). The buildings were torn down in 1991, and the rest of the area left as a park. (Rather nice, isn&#8217;t it?) Polygon Homes bought the property and erected a rather large condominium complex.<br />
It&#8217;s a one-bedroom apartment that appears to have been bought by parents for their daughter. (That&#8217;s a guess, of course. We don&#8217;t actually know.) At any rate, the daughter was moving out, having bought her own place, and the parents wanted to rent.<br />
Allison&#8217;s eyes were immediately drawn to the moldings. She loves moldings. Sometimes, I think she just likes to say &#8220;moldings&#8221; &#8230; at least until we were in this apartment. Now I&#8217;m convinced she just wants moldings. I figure a few feet of nice moldings for her birthday will keep her happy.<br />
My mind was made up within a couple of minutes after entering the apartment. Allison&#8217;s mind was made up after she saw the laundry machine. We didn&#8217;t tell each other until we&#8217;d left the building and were preparing to leave.<br />
The layout was very well-designed: The kitchen was to the left of the door (no long, useless hallway in this unit), with a nice window into the living room. The living/dining room is a large space (the entire unit is 775 sq ft.) with a gas fireplace (the unit has radiant heat &#8212; a rather nice touch, if you ask me). To the right of the door is a short hallway, at the end of which is the laundry (to the right) and the bathroom (to the left). The bedroom is in the corner of the unit, next to the living room and bathroom. A walk-in closet should accomodate our clothes easily.<br />
And that&#8217;s just the apartment. Down the hall is a recreation room, including a universal gym. By comparison, our building has an exercise bike, treadmill, and stairmaster. We get two parking spots, full recycling (our building only has paper), storage and bike locker.<br />
The only thing our soon-to-be-apartment doesn&#8217;t have is a view. However, we can walk for one minute and get a view that&#8217;s much better than the one we currently have. Certainly no complains on my part&#8230;<br />
Well, maybe one small complaint. We had to make a trade-off in obtaining our new digs &#8212; convenience. Unlike our current apartment, the new pad isn&#8217;t really within walking distance of anything. It&#8217;s a very short drive, however, to all our favourite haunts. So it&#8217;s not really that big a deal. If we&#8217;re not pressed for time (which, realistically speaking, we won&#8217;t be now that we&#8217;ve got a dishwasher and laundry machine), we can still walk &#8212; it just takes longer.<br />
At any rate, we move on the 31st (hopefully the 30th, which is a Sunday) into our new place. The address is changing (I&#8217;ll send it along as soon as I remember what it is), but we&#8217;ll try to keep the phone number. No point in causing too much confusion.<br />
How long are we going to stay at our new place? Until we go to Europe, move downtown, or get bored of it and go somewhere else.<br />
Whichever comes first.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago, I made the decision to join the company softball team, the Rad Sox (Rad, as is &#8220;Radical&#8221;). This was for several reasons: I&#8217;d get out more, meet more people in the company that I wouldn&#8217;t normally have interaction with, hopefully improve my skills, and have fun.<br />
Two out of four ain&#8217;t so bad, I guess&#8230;<br />
We&#8217;ve played three games now, and we&#8217;ve lost each and every time &#8212; usually by a very unhealthy margin (our second game was something obscene, like 38 to 3). We practice a lot, usually without a lot of progress, it seems. Although my fielding is better, I still have problems.<br />
For example, on our Friday practice, I managed to somehow manage not to get my glove under the ball. So instead of the ball landing in my glove, it instead drove into the nail of my right big toe. Nearly bent the nail in half. Couldn&#8217;t walk very quickly for a couple of hours. Rather painful. Luckily, nothing was broken, and the bleeding was minimal.<br />
So let&#8217;s skip ahead to Monday night (don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get back to the weekend in a minute). This was our third game, against some other company (we usually don&#8217;t know the names). I spent the first half of the game in the dugout (we have too many people for everyone to play the whole game). When my chance finally came up, I raced onto the field (mostly in an effort to warm up &#8212; it was very cold last night &#8230; did I mention that I&#8217;ve taken a strong dislike to the weather in this city?).<br />
I played third. First time that I was brought into the infield. Until then, I&#8217;d played the outfield &#8230; and sucked horribly. The coaches figured I needed the chance to suck on the infield. So I sat there, ready to play the role I was supposed to play. I made a catch, taking out a runner to third, and overall seemed to be doing pretty well.<br />
Until the next batter came up.<br />
She hit usually down the baseline, or bunted. Either way, Jon (the shortstop) suggested I play a bit closer to the baseline. Sure enough, next hit went straight towards me. It was an easy catch &#8212; the ball was rolling across the grass (albeit very quickly). I extended my glove, ready to snatch the rolling ball and throw it to first.<br />
The fields that we play on vary in quality. Some are pretty good. Some are really bad. And then there is Churchill (this is where we played last night). If you removed the grass, it would look a little like the surface of the moon.<br />
When the ball reached about two feet from my glove, it hit one of the many divots/dents/craters in the field and shot up at about a 45 degree angle. Although my brain could not tell my hand exactly where it was going to catch the ball, it did manage to tell my eyes to close and brace for impact.<br />
It&#8217;s amazing how much inertia an ordinary softball travelling at 60km/h has. It&#8217;s also amazing how much abuse the human nose can take without breaking. But at least I stopped the ball.<br />
While I was reeling backward, trying to figure out whether or not I was upright or dead, the game continued until the ump had the notion to suspend play at one base (or something like that &#8212; you&#8217;ll forgive me if I didn&#8217;t pay a lot of attention to the game). I returned to the dugout to stop the bleeding (which didn&#8217;t take all that long, surprisingly). I stayed out for the rest of the game.<br />
So I&#8217;m now on partial DL until Wednesday, at which time I&#8217;ll figure out how I&#8217;m feeling. Hopefully, it&#8217;s not too bad&#8230;<br />
Anyway, back to Friday. Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, came out to visit for the weekend. Exact reasons, we didn&#8217;t know, only that she probably wanted to get away from home for a couple of days. I picked her up at the corner of Granville and W. Georgia, hopped a SkyTrain, and headed for the Old Spaghetti Factory in New Westminster.<br />
Allison appeared about a half hour after Jane and I got a seat, as the weekend traffic made getting across the bridge from Surrey rather difficult. We stuffed ourselves on OSF&#8217;s pasta and bread, all the while engaging in conversation.<br />
That evening, we took Jane to Playdium, to engage in some serious video-gaming. &gt;From 10pm until 4am, you can play as much as you like for $25. Yeah, it sounds expensive, but when you consider that most games cost $2 normally, it&#8217;s a really good deal. We played a good number of the games until about 1am, when we headed home exhausted.<br />
The next day, we drove down to Granville Island to spend an afternoon roaming around. After managing to find a parking spot (a bit of a feat, now that the traffic levels are beginning to skyrocket) we headed into the Island.<br />
Initially heading for food, we stopped to watch a busker. Allison and I had seen this act before, last summer. Joel from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan (at which point everyone was instructed to say &#8220;Ooooooo&#8221;) was performing the trick made famous by Harry Houdini: Handcuffed, wrapped in chains, placed in a bag, and escape in under a minute. It&#8217;s actually a pretty simple trick, once you see how it&#8217;s done.<br />
I got abducted as his assistant. Oh yay.<br />
After he made a few cracks at my job (I never bothered to mention I work for a video game company &#8230; dopey me), I made an effort to cuff him very tightly. Further cracks wanted me to chain him as tightly as possible. I can only assume that&#8217;s why he does that. A poor girl from Delta (the equivalent of Brampton to Toronto) got suckered into checking his pockets for keys &#8230; something she really didn&#8217;t want to do.<br />
Needless to say, he escaped. In 57 seconds. He held out for three seconds to heighten the drama.<br />
Following lunch, we headed over to the Granville Island Brewery to have a tour, only we missed it by an hour. The next one was at 4:00. Back into the market to get dinner. We bought stuffed pork shops (which are *mighty* tasty, albeit huge), corn, and various vegetables for skewers.<br />
We missed the 4:00 tour because I couldn&#8217;t hold out any longer, and had to make a bathroom break. We took the opportunity, though, to get some beer and a bottle of wine.<br />
For my birthday, the Collins bought me a wine rack. Yes, a wine rack. It has a counter on top that we keep the microwave on. It&#8217;s very handy. Almost every time we go to Granville Island, we buy a bottle of wine. When we finally get the thing filled, we&#8217;ll actually start to drink it.<br />
We spend our time indoors, eating, drinking (beer and daiquiris) and watching &#8220;Home Fries&#8221;. Seriously messed up movie. Of course, it was written by Vince Gilligan, famous for writing seriously messed up X-Files episodes.<br />
Sunday was a weird day. Allison and I spend most of our time trying to kill time. After we sent Jane on her way, we needed to kill a few hours &#8212; we were going to a concert that night.<br />
I will admit that Alanis Morrisette doesn&#8217;t exactly rock my world &#8230; but she&#8217;s a pretty good performer, all things considered. She&#8217;s short (at least compared to the rest of her band) and quite energetic. Good live singing voice, too.<br />
The opening acts were Veda Hill (some local performer) and Sloan. Once again, Sloan&#8217;s bad luck with sound struck at them &#8212; the only reason I knew what song they were playing is because I could figure out the odd guitar chord and drum beat. It wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;Money City Maniacs&#8221;, their last song in the set, that the sound was reasonable. After Sloan&#8217;s set, Chris Murphy took a seat in the audience a couple rows behind us, just outside of arms&#8217; reach.<br />
The sound, of course, was tuned to Alanis. Despite the fact that she was over a half hour late hitting the stage, she put on a pretty good show. She did a very interesting rendition of &#8220;You Outta Know&#8221; &#8212; the music was extremely tame (no harsh guitars or heavy drums) for the first two verses. It really showcased the anger that the lyrics exude. Her encore I predicted about halfway through the show: &#8220;Thank You&#8221; and &#8220;Ironic&#8221;. But she didn&#8217;t end there, playing two more songs before coming back with an acoustical set. Quite impressive. She even let her pianist go nuts for a few minutes, showcasing some of the most amazing jazz-influenced talent I&#8217;ve ever heard.<br />
When all&#8217;s said and done, it was a good weekend. Now if we can just warm this corner of the country up a bit, it&#8217;ll actually get liveable around here.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&#8220;The goats have been sucked.&#8221;<br />
That was how the Rad Sox season wound up Saturday afternoon. We started off the season with a fairly inspirational rallying cry before each game. However, as our less-than-stellar season progressed, the cry degraded to: &#8220;Don&#8217;t suck goats!&#8221;<br />
Why goats? Dunno. It was Amy&#8217;s idea. We found it funny, and it put our games into perspective &#8212; don&#8217;t take it seriously. This was a good thing, considering how bad we usually lose. In our entire season, playoff games included, we stand at 24 games played, and only two wins.<br />
Yes, two.<br />
Why? Well, we were playing in a league with people who were (approximately) our age, unlike the &#8220;Old Sweaty Fat Guys&#8221; league the Sox were in last year. This, naturally, made them better than those in the &#8220;OSFG&#8221; league. We also had a problem of getting our key team members (i.e. the good players) to show up on a regular basis. This is partly the reason we lost all three of our games on Saturday.<br />
Triple headers hurt. Especially if they start at 8:00am. I pulled myself out from under the sheets at 7:07am, and managed to trudge my way into some clothes and get down to the car. Because we had to be at our field at 7:40 (so dictated by our coaches), I wanted to give myself a fair bit of leeway. It took (usually) 30 minutes to drive from Metrotown to Kerrisdale (where Allison used to live), so I figured on about 20 minutes.<br />
Even with a stop at Country Style to grab a dozen doughnuts, I still arrived 10 minutes early. No-one else showed until about 10 minutes later, during which I began to wonder if I was on the correct field. (I was, of course.)<br />
Our first game was against our arch-rivals, the Bladerunners. We don&#8217;t much like them. They&#8217;re really annoying. Their coach uses a kid&#8217;s toy megaphone. It&#8217;s annoying. Their first baseperson starts off every inning with a &#8220;Three up, three down, Bladerunners!&#8221; in a fake gravelly voice. She&#8217;s annoying. And although we creamed them 24-7 the last time we met, we lost by six runs. That was really annoying.<br />
Our game ended at 9:35, which meant we had just under four hours until our next game. It was time for breakfast. I headed downtown to meet the others for our morning meal. In the end, only Jonn and I ate, the others opting to work. (We&#8217;re on tight deadlines &#8212; two of our games are attempting to get out the door.)<br />
I returned to the office following breakfast to wait out the remaining hour or so by playing video games. Not even through my first lap in &#8220;Need for Speed III&#8221;, my phone rang. Allison was looking for her parents.<br />
The Collins&#8217; were coming over for the weekend to go to the PNE &#8230; and watch the Rad Sox lose two softball games. They were supposed to call Allison when they got downtown, before boarding a bus to Oakridge Mall (which is close to the baseball diamonds we were playing at). Allison was concerned that they were lost (even though the Collins&#8217; had travelled through Europe all on their own), and she was going to go find them. Thinking this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea (the Collins were to call our apartment, so I wanted Allison to stay), I offered to go look.<br />
I cut my game short, hopped in my car, and headed out to Oakridge. I parked at the Safeway (the Collins were supposed to be waiting there), and walked inside. No sooner had I reached the entrance to Safeway inside the mall did my phone ring. In fact, I was holding it in my hand, and had already dialled the first four digits of my home phone number. It was Allison. The Collins had called. They were in the food court.<br />
I waited with the Collins while they ate lunch, but had to head out to the ball park before Allison arrived. Even then, Allison and her parents were virtually right behind me, arriving mere minutes after me.<br />
Our second game was up against the Paper Kings. We like them a lot better than the Bladerunners. Very nice people. We had to borrow a player from another team (one of the nice people from the Bladerunners) because we were short a woman &#8212; we have to have at least three on the field at any time. We played a very close game, ultimately losing by only a couple of runs. Barb (our borrowed player) was dying in the field towards the end, desperately in need of a toilet. No sooner was the last out called that she took off across the field towards the washrooms, somehow still managing to cross her legs at the same time.<br />
Our third game was against the Tubeworms. They&#8217;re competitive. Not as bad as #69 on the Rippers (who would win the coveted &#8220;Jerk of the Year&#8221; award, if we had one in our league), but they just creamed us. Well, at least as much as a maximum of 10 runs can be considered a creaming. (League rules have a 10 run lead maximum during playoffs. There are a lot of weird rules in our league.)<br />
We sucked goats. Our last game was the worst of the three. Probably because we were exhausted &#8212; physically, and emotionally. You can only take a beating for so long before you become really frustrated. I know I was frustrated &#8212; my last up to bat of the year was a pop-fly after two horrible fouls. It put me in a pretty rough mood for the rest of the day.<br />
The next day was our trip to the PNE. We wanted to be there for the opening of the gates at 10:30 so we could quickly get into the PNE prize home. Every year since 1934 (not including the war years, when the PNE was used as a training camp and Japanese-Canadian internment centre), the PNE has offered a prize home. This year&#8217;s home is the largest ever offered: 4,189 square feet. It&#8217;s freaking huge. And frankly, not all that exciting. I&#8217;ve seen better. Like last year&#8217;s home. But it had a few design features we took away for use at a later date.<br />
We ventured through the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building, where you can literally buy nearly anything you&#8217;ve seen advertised on TV. It&#8217;s usually packed full of people and really annoying demonstrations offered by people wearing hands-free microphones with solid understanding of the human need to buy useless junk. Okay, that&#8217;s a bit harsh, there are useful things in there, but you have to look for them. Like the fudge.<br />
We wandered around a bit, eventually finding ourselves at the Pig Races. We couldn&#8217;t actually see them, however, as there was a tremendous wall of people surrounding the spectacle. We continued on to the Petting Zoo. Mr. Collins looked like a little kid as he got in line.<br />
The Zoo is small &#8212; a gazebo about 30 feet across. Inside are chickens of various breeds, goats (old and young), sheep, donkeys, pigs, rabbits, chicks, ducklings, a couple of llamas, and lots of children. The animals are surprisingly content with people touching them all over.<br />
Following our visit with the kids, we took a short hike through Hastings Park. This is the fate of the PNE. Although the PNE has resided in its current location since 1910, the city of Vancouver is slowly converting it into an actual park. We saw Phase I for the first time this year &#8212; a second of ground that had been dug out for large ponds that had once been part of the midway. Over the next three years, most of the park will be torn up and replaced with trees and grass. The PNE&#8217;s days are numbered.<br />
You may be asking: &#8220;Why?&#8221; Simple answer: There&#8217;s no park on that side of town. More complicated reason: Although the PNE is the largest 4-H event in North America, it&#8217;s agricultural roots are beginning to die away &#8212; it&#8217;s really not the best place to hold these sorts of things anymore. There&#8217;s been talk for years of moving the agricultural events to Abbotsford, and the fair to Delta. At the moment, it&#8217;s only talk. The ultimate fate of the PNE is unknown, since no-one in government seems capable of making up their minds. It&#8217;s possible that in the struggle to sort all this out, the PNE might be brought to a final close.<br />
After lunch, we visited Hastings Racetrack, to watch the horses. I&#8217;d never been to horse racing before. I don&#8217;t have any great desire to go again. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s (a little) fascinating to watch, but after two races, you get the general idea. Unless you&#8217;re into the betting aspect of it, there&#8217;s not much pull.<br />
It was then over to the Techni-Cal Superdogs show. We&#8217;d gone to the one last year, and thought it was pretty neat. This years show was, well, I leaned over to Allison just as the lights dimmed and muttered: &#8220;Let the cheese begin.&#8221;<br />
The show was held in the Pacific Coliseum, formerly home to the Vancouver Canucks. It was dubbed &#8220;Hollywoof&#8221;, and featured the &#8220;race to the moon&#8221; &#8212; a doggie obstacle course that pitted one side of the coliseum against the other. My frustration from the day before seeped back in as our side kept losing races.<br />
Sometimes, I think I&#8217;m not cut out for competition sports.<br />
The highlight of the show was a race between a 160-pound Rottweiler and a one-pound ball of fuzz, called Hiccup. The ball of fuzz won. The low point of the show was the introduction of the leader for the blue side (our side of the coliseum) &#8212; Captain Woof. He was described (rather accurately) by the leader of the red side as a &#8220;Village People reject&#8221;.<br />
Following the show, we went to see the Main Gate Theatre show. This was a production about the past 89 years of the PNE. It&#8217;s a musical, performed by four people (two men, two women) who appear to be theatre students. They&#8217;re pretty good actors, and decent singers. One of them looked a little like Gerry, but enough that I knew that it wasn&#8217;t him. Besides, I&#8217;ve heard Gerry sing&#8230; (Just kidding, Ger!)<br />
Then it was a race down to the Pig Races. Mr. Collins and I cut through a few hundred people and managed to save four seats on the bench to watch the races. The track is simplistic, a horseshoe-shaped track with a pool of water and a slide in the middle (this is for the duck races).<br />
Richard runs the thing. He started this many years ago, and spends most of the year touring with pigs and ducks. He told us that every May, he makes the trip from Woods Hole, Arkansas to Manitoba to collect four racing pigs. He then trains them (which he claims ain&#8217;t difficult) and takes them on tour.<br />
Pigs run pretty darn quickly. In fact, the actual race takes about 10 seconds. If that. So in order to make a show out of it, Richard also races ducks. They don&#8217;t race the same distance as the pigs &#8212; they go about a fourth of the distance, then up a ramp and down a slide into a pool of water.<br />
Then the pigs come out. Unlike the ducks, the pigs have names, such as Hammy Fay Bacon (Tammy Fay Bakker). Then the gate opens, they tear around the track, up a ramp at the other end, whip down the front of the cages to a dish containing exactly one mini-donut. That&#8217;s what the pigs race for. Frankly, I could understand that.<br />
I understood that so much that the first thing I did after the race was buy a bag of mini-donuts. They&#8217;re not quite as tasty as the Tiny Tom Donuts at the CNE, but they&#8217;re pretty darn close.<br />
After we pigged out on the mini-donuts, we headed out to get a hat. Bank 1, making a foray into the Canadian credit card market, was offering hats if you signed up for their card. This was when I temporarily lost the Collins&#8217;.<br />
I had to make use of the facilities. I raced in, telling the Collins they could keep going and I would catch up. When I came back out moments later, I couldn&#8217;t see them. So I raced into the &#8220;As Seen On TV&#8221; building to find them. I raced around for about ten minutes, somehow managing to miss two of them twice, before spotting Mr. Collins looking for me.<br />
Our PNE visit came to close. I was thankful for that &#8212; the lower half of my body was about ready to fall off. My legs were still reeling from the punishment I&#8217;d dealt them the day before. Allison&#8217;s feet were threatening to go on strike, so it was good timing on a whole.<br />
Undoubtedly, you may be wondering why it&#8217;s been a month since the last Observer&#8217;s Log. I&#8217;ve been busy. Really, really busy. With several major projects on the go at any one time, I haven&#8217;t had a lot of energy to whip one of these off. Not to mention that Allison and I have been laying low since the last weekend of July, to try and cope with the stress.<br />
However, it&#8217;s high time for an update, so I&#8217;m sending one out. Hopefully, they&#8217;ll be a bit more frequent from now on.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The shock came Thursday night, when I accidentally ran into the press conference while flipping channels &#8212; Gretzky was going to retire.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t help but think to myself: &#8220;Wow.&#8221; That was about all I could think of &#8212; this was a man who had been a name brand since I was seven years old. I remember reading my Owl Magazine in 1979, reading about some young hotshot about to enter the NHL, to play for some team in Edmonton.<br />
Two decades later, he left the NHL, taking his number with him &#8212; 99. Some say he was the greatest player who ever lived, some say he was the greatest player who will ever live. I say that when all&#8217;s said and done, Wayne Gretzky is The Great One.<br />
I watched the official announcement on Friday at work (we have TVs all over the hallways, which are regularly tuned to TSN or SportsNet &#8212; used to be ESPN, but we don&#8217;t like them anymore). We discussed amongst ourselves just what this announcement really meant to the world, and to each other.<br />
When Gretzky entered the league, it was a popular sport &#8212; mostly in Canada, and to a lesser degree, the States. Suddenly, this kid started tearing things apart. In a few short years, he brought the Oilers, previously thought of as some hick start-up, to victory in the Stanley Cup. Gretzky had made his mark &#8212; only he wouldn&#8217;t stop there.<br />
He kept going, and making marks wherever he stepped. The name Gretzky is synonymous with hockey &#8230; or perhaps, is hockey synonymous with Gretzky? Either way, both are changed for life. And Gretzky&#8217;s marks will probably never fade. The league is more likely to fade before The Great One&#8217;s legend.<br />
He is a legend, you know. His name is spoken in hushed tones when he enters a room. Kids (especially those playing hockey) are left wide-eyed and wide-mouthed should they ever see him in public. And with his seemingly doubtful return to hockey (or so says his father), his feats will be exaggerated, his skill embellished, and perhaps even his name dropped, until we know only of &#8220;The Great One&#8221;.<br />
In the meantime, the NHL is in trouble. Like when the NBA lost Jordon, the NHL is without the best ambassador it had for decades. There is no-one to pick up the torch. Sure, Jagr and Kariya have both been listed as the two most likely to become the &#8220;next&#8221; Great One, but they can never come close to being like Gretzky.<br />
Gretzky had presence. He had humility. He had patience. And above all else, he played for a team &#8230; not for himself. There is no-one playing hockey with those qualities. Perhaps in a few years, Gretzky may start coaching &#8212; maybe then he&#8217;ll train someone properly. But until then, the NHL will remain boxing on ice, with no-one to show what skill can do for the game.<br />
Saturday provided us relief from hockey, so that Allison and I could prepare ourselves for a later period in our lives. We babysitted (babysat? &#8212; aye, there&#8217;s the rub) for our friend, Kelly. And I mean baby &#8212; six months old.<br />
This we did as a favour, not because we really wanted to babysit &#8212; we had a lot of other things we needed to do that day. But in the end, it served as good practice for me. (Although, thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to change any diapers!)<br />
Gemma and mother appeared at about 1pm. After some quick instructions and presentation of Gemma&#8217;s things, Kelly quickly ducked out the door, and left her pride and joy in our capable hands.<br />
Okay, in *Allison&#8217;s* capable hands. Mine aren&#8217;t quite so capable.<br />
As was demonstrated when I decided it was time for Gemma&#8217;s lunch. You&#8217;d figure that somewhere along the line, instinct would lead you to want to eat. Through all my psychology courses, they told us about how repeated action leads to learning &#8212; you eat a few times, you&#8217;d think you&#8217;d remember how to eat. But no: &#8220;That spoon is a foreign object, and you gotta be kidding me if you think I&#8217;m gonna eat any of that Pablum, pal!&#8221;<br />
I got more of the Pablum on her face than in her mouth.<br />
After a little while, Gemma suddenly figured out I was giving her food. Suddenly, she couldn&#8217;t get enough. I was fighting for control of the spoon, holding the plate in place, and desperately trying to shovel as much Pablum and liquified squash as Gemma&#8217;d take. Then Allison took over for a while. After a few minutes, Gemma stopped eating.<br />
That afternoon, we realised why parents relish nap time &#8212; babies pass out, and stay that way for a few hours. We really noticed this when Gemma got up &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t too pleased about it.<br />
Kelly arrived just after 5:30 to remove Gemma from the premises, along with Allison&#8217;s old computer (having agreed to buy it).<br />
We were exhausted, and weren&#8217;t too keen on cleaning up so we could make dinner. So we went out to a nearby restaurant called (are you ready for this?) the &#8220;Seafood Shack&#8221;.<br />
Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking &#8212; sounds really classy, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
We didn&#8217;t know what we were getting into, but with an Entertainment Book coupon (allowing for a 2 for 1 special), we thought it was worth a try. We were quite pleasantly surprised: The decor was decent (furnished in late IKEA), the service was outstanding (except for how long it took to get the bill), and the food was &#8230; well, if you come to visit, we&#8217;ll take you there and let you judge for yourself.<br />
Allison dined on blackened Louisiana catfish on linguini, and having sampled a few pieces, I can safely say that it was very tasty. I opted for the Seafood Risotto. This was a wonderful melange of clams and mussels (both in the shell), with scallops, shrimp, and a thick, flavourful tomato sauce. The presentation of both dishes was exquisite.<br />
Sunday brought the day that most Canadians wish didn&#8217;t have to come &#8212; Wayne Gretzky&#8217;s last game. And for the blasphemy of all blasphemies, we didn&#8217;t watch the game. We had a good reason, though &#8212; we had to do all the errands we couldn&#8217;t do the day before (on account of having a baby temporarily disrupt our lives). But fear not &#8212; we did watch until the first commercial in the first period.<br />
And for the record, I would like to state that I accurately predicted the NHL&#8217;s decision to unilaterally retire the number &#8217;99&#8217; from all teams. It actually brought a tear to my eye.<br />
Gretzky is gone, and hockey will never be the same. I have found that I do want children, but not for a few years. I will now eat a lot more seafood than I would normally admit to. Maybe next time, I&#8217;ll be the one to change the diaper.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Our long weekend started Thursday night, when Allison&#8217;s company decided to hold an employee appreciation event at Metropolis (an entertainment-centric mall a couple of blocks from our apartment). Interlogic was springing for two hours of video games at Sega Playdium, and then dinner at the Rainforest Cafe.<br />
We didn&#8217;t find out about these plans until Wednesday night, so I was unable to make the video games (already having made plans to the &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; with some of my co-workers). However, I made an effort to drop by for dinner.<br />
This was the first time I&#8217;d met Allison&#8217;s new co-workers, and most of them seemed very nice. Claire, in particular, was extremely cordial &#8212; but since she&#8217;s the HR manager, I guess that&#8217;s to be expected.<br />
When we returned home, we made our final decision to go to Victoria for the weekend. We had tentative plans for some time, but we based our final decision to go on the fact that Allison&#8217;s grandmother was in the Royal Jubilee Hospital in Victoria. Her grandmother had been the focal point of the Collins/Vailmont Easter for about 30 years, and it just seemed wrong not to come over and cheer her up.<br />
(As you may recall, we were in Nanaimo last Easter, engaged in Easter egg hunts in the grandparent&#8217;s yard. This would be the first year in about three decades where the hunt would not happen.)<br />
Early Friday morning, we hauled ourselves out of bed, and hit the road to Tsawwassen. Because of the Easter weekend, BC Ferries were running trips every hour, instead of every two hours, which was the norm. This was good for us, since we didn&#8217;t need to worry about missing a sailing &#8230; which we did.<br />
Arriving about ten minutes too late to make the 10:00 sailing, we parked the car and opted for a late breakfast &#8212; pizza. But this was no ordinary pizza, it was *breakfast* pizza: Eggs, onions, ham, green peppers, cheese, but no tomato sauce. It was surprisingly tasty, and fairly expensive. If they made announcements, it would go something like this:<br />
&#8220;Your attention, please. BC Ferries is happy to charge you exceedingly high prices for low-quality food that you will buy because you are hungry from trying to get here on time not to miss a sailing, or your children are begging you into submission&#8230;&#8221;<br />
We made the 11:00 sailing with no trouble.<br />
We sailed across on the Spirit of British Columbia, the largest short-distance ferry in the fleet (another larger ferry carts passengers up the coast, which is an overnight trip). It&#8217;s a massive vessel, about the size of a small cruise ship. It makes the trip fairly enjoyable &#8230; at least if you don&#8217;t suffer from motion sickness.<br />
Procuring a seat in the corner of the cafeteria, I ran cover by buying some snack food while Allison worked. BC Ferries doesn&#8217;t take kindly to people sucking up table space, so I made an effort to make them think we were eating &#8230; just really really slowly.<br />
Arriving in Victoria, we found it was raining. We had hoped that the weather would be nice for a change, but the generally poor weather was following us around. And no, before you think it, one does not get used to continually bad weather; one gets increasingly irritable.<br />
After a short drive into Victoria, we headed over to the Royal Jubilee Hospital to check in with the family elders. After parking, we wandered inside, and attempted to find Allison&#8217;s parents. We knew they were there &#8212; Allison&#8217;s Aunt Robin drives a very recognisable car.<br />
Luckily for us, we ran into Robin on the second floor, while attempting to find the washroom. Allison&#8217;s grandmother was pleased to see us, as were her parents. We visited briefly as a pair, then ducked into the TV room.<br />
We stayed at the hospital until around 6:00 or so, at which time we headed over to Robin&#8217;s apartment for dinner.<br />
We slept on the floor that night, a probably-not-so-great idea. I woke with a stiffness bordering on rigor mortis, Allison not better off. But we grinned and bore it, and had a leisurely breakfast with Robin, Allison&#8217;s parents, and her grandfather.<br />
The morning was significantly brighter than the previous day, the sun having actually shone through for a change. After a quick visit to the hospital, we opted for a tour of Victoria. Okay, maybe not *really* a tour &#8212; we had been there before, after all &#8212; but it was a good excuse to go out.<br />
We drove downtown, parking on a side street near the Eaton Centre. We had only an hour (the parking meter went no further) to wander about. So we wandered &#8230; right into Roger&#8217;s Chocolates.<br />
Roger&#8217;s is a mainstay in parts of BC &#8212; it&#8217;s an old company, specialising in some very tasty treats. It&#8217;s like Laura Secord back east &#8230; only better. Our mission was to obtain Easter chocolates for the family &#8212; this was not going to be a typical Easter, so we thought it better that we make an effort to do something special.<br />
After our romp through the chocolate shop, we walked around the harbour area, wandering into The Empress hotel. We checked out the prices of the lunch menus, suffered sticker shock, and proceeded back outside again.<br />
After moving the car to a less time-dependent location (a very cheap parking garage), we hopped out to find some lunch. We headed into an Indian restaurant, and promptly started inquring about the soup of the day. That&#8217;s when we found out that there was no lunch special on weekends, which meant the prices more than doubled. We made a hasty exit and went into another Indian restaurant two doors down.<br />
Being a beautiful day, we spent a fair bit of time wandering along the walkway around the inner harbour. You could hear the mainstay bagpiper from across the harbour with no difficulty.<br />
Walking around towards the parliment buildings, we passed a congregation of people, surrounding a small brass band, and a boat covered with flowers. Our first impression was that someone was being married. It wasn&#8217;t until a while later that it occurred to us that it was actually a memorial service.<br />
The walkways were packed with people, all relishing in the bright sunshine. (It was so bright that I nearly got a sunburn!) But the temperature was still cool, so only the brave (or the stupid) wore shorts. And yes, I did have a pair with me &#8212; it was still too cool for my liking.<br />
Buskers were about, too. We saw one busker whose act we remembered from the year before. There were a few differences, which made the overall show pretty good, certainly worth the two dollars Allison gave the busker.<br />
On the way back to the car, we checked for the availability of a hotel &#8212; we weren&#8217;t too keen on staying on the floor for a second night. We found one hotel room left for $30, and promptly headed off before we lost it.<br />
The Friendship Inn has been in Victoria since the dawn of time, or sometime roughly near it. The buildings are old, the rooms musty, and the mattresses somewhat curved. But for $30, I wasn&#8217;t about to complain any. Well, maybe except for the people &#8220;living&#8221; next door. We didn&#8217;t leave our things, opting to bring them back with us.<br />
If you go just west of Victoria, you&#8217;ll run into Esquimalt. Dependng on who you ask, Esquimalt is either a scary, run-down, naval base-influenced town; or it&#8217;s a fairly nice little suburb. I personally vote for the latter. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; there are some seedy areas (but then, even Oakville has its seedy areas).<br />
We drove about, looking at the houses, even looking into an open house out of curiousity, just to see what was about. We drove up and down, back and forth, eventually finding ourselves back in Victoria again.<br />
So we drove up and down, back and forth, until we found ourselves driving along Dallas Road, heading into Oak Bay. We had driven along this route before the previous year, only it was Allison driving, and it was at night. It pretty much ended the same way, with us passing along the north side of UVic trying to find our way back into Victoria.<br />
We returned to the hospital towards dinnertime, to check on everyone milling around Allison&#8217;s grandmother. We were surprised to find Randy and Jane (Allison&#8217;s brother and sister) in attendence, and we had to do a double take when we saw Brenna and Cameron (Allison&#8217;s cousins, who live in Parksville). They were on their way back to Nanaimo (and Parksville). We nearly passed each other in the hall.<br />
Dinner was at Robin&#8217;s again, only instead of the home-cooked meal we ate the night before, we had Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
As a child, I remember loving Kentucky Fried Chicken. Of course, as a child, I could eat whatever I wanted without any consequences. As an adult, I am convinced that KFC is evidence of Satan&#8217;s existence. Allison and I both regretted dinner&#8230;<br />
On the way back to our hotel that night, I noticed something a little strange &#8212; the car seemed to be a bit louder. In fact, it vibrated a bit more, too. In the back of my mind, I knew what the problem was. In the front of my mind, I was denying it with every ounce of my strength.<br />
The next morning, the truth finally decided it would not be contained. On the way out to have something to eat, the muffler broke loose. Well, partially loose &#8212; there was a large rubber bracket holding the muffer to the car. As Allison&#8217;s mother would point out later, every time my car and the island have anything to do with one another, I have problems with the car.<br />
Pulling off to the side, I whipped out my trusty bungee cord, and lashed the stupid muffler to the underside of the car. Ideally, I would&#8217;ve just taken the muffler off, but that rubber connector just taunted me.<br />
We headed back to Vancouver in early afternoon, realising that if we hurried, we could get to Granville Island before it closed. (It was this revelation that made Allison convinced that she couldn&#8217;t live anywhere outside of Vancouver &#8212; she couldn&#8217;t get to the Market whenever she wanted.)<br />
A good weekend. It&#8217;s been a long time since we&#8217;ve had a good weekend. I mean a weekend where we didn&#8217;t have to worry about being rained on. Believe me &#8212; that&#8217;s a long time.<br />
After a leisurely rising Saturday morning, I went out to get my muffler fixed. That was my first mistake &#8212; I found out that the entire exhaust system was about two minutes from giving out. $200 later, I was out getting my car washed. That was my second mistake &#8212; Allison wanted me home earlier than that to clean. As soon as I got in, we were running back out again.<br />
We were going to spend the afternoon at Granville Island (yes, we go there a lot) looking around the market and buying food for dinner. It was a good way to spend the afternoon.<br />
Sunday started off even more beautifully than Saturday. It was warm (we opened all the windows for the first time this year) and sunny &#8212; the day was just waiting to be enjoyed. So we spent an hour cleaning. Don&#8217;t laugh &#8212; you&#8217;d be surprised how good that made us feel.<br />
As we were working, Allison heard a news story on the TV, talking about how the Alberta Report (a group of ultra right-wing wackos from Alberta &#8212; although there are those who think that *anyone* from Alberta is an ultra right-wing wacko) was going to take their message to Toronto, which the Report viewed as where most of the evils in Canada came from.<br />
It was then that it suddenly hit me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t view Toronto (or Oakville, for that matter) as home. In fact, it seemed somewhat foreign to me. It was no longer a place that was comforting, familiar &#8212; it was very distant, cold, disparate from everything I could think of.<br />
It was with a great and sudden shock that I realised that I have become a BCer: I complain about the rain and the cold (despite the fact that it&#8217;s not that cold), I wear sandals as often as possible (I&#8217;m wearing them right now), I can&#8217;t stand the NDP government (but will probably vote for them because all the alternatives are far worse), and view the east as an entirely different place. Canada is certainly different when you&#8217;re not in the centre of the universe anymore&#8230;<br />
At any rate, after our quick spring clean, we jumped in the car, and ran out to enjoy the day. We ended the day with a quick pasta dish, which for some unknown reason, made the whole weekend complete.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This weekend was a little strange &#8212; we received some very unusual weather.<br />
It all started Friday night. As we were walking around English Bay with our friend Tyler, returning from a wonderful Greek dinner, we noticed that the sky was dark &#8212; much darker than we were used to. As we gazed up into the sky, we noticed that not only was it dark, but the soft texture seemed to have disappeared. It was now just a stark blackness, save for tens of millions of tiny, shimmering specks. At first, we didn&#8217;t know what to make of it &#8212; had something gone wrong with the clouds? Why were they so black?<br />
Then came the uncomfortable truth &#8230; our comforting blanket of cloud-cover was gone. The bleakness of space could be seen &#8212; our protection from UFOs was nowhere to be found.<br />
We quickly ran indoors to protect ourselves from the open night.<br />
The following morning, we rose slowly, allowing ourselves to bask in the joy of the weekend dawn. Yet again, we were disturbed by a change in the norm &#8212; one of us had left the light on all night.<br />
As I fumbled about, trying to find out which light was still on, I had a sudden attack of fear &#8212; none of the lights were on; the mysterious light was coming from outside. With a shaking hand, I slowly parted the window, only to have my eye seared by a powerful light from the sky.<br />
I darted back into the room, jumping back into the safety of my bed, and pulling the pillow overtop of my face, resisting the urge to break into tears. I was terrified &#8212; the sky had caught fire, and we were all going to die.<br />
Allison asked me what was wrong, why was I shaking with terror? I told her about our imminent doom. She took it surprisingly well. She got out of bed, and peered out the window. I expected to hear a shriek that would wake the dead. Instead, my ears only met with a sigh. For a moment, I thought it was the sound of her last breath, having peered into the face of Death.<br />
But no &#8212; she breathed further! In fact, she threw the curtains open, allowing more of that curséd light to pour into the room, filling every crack, and even passing through the comfort of my pillow. A moment later, my comfort was ripped away as my love flung the sheets from the bed, exposing my poor body to that harsh brightness.<br />
&#8220;Why?&#8221; I pleaded, &#8220;Why do you torture me so?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Because it is the dawn, and the spring is upon us!&#8221; she harkened, throwing open the window to the day.<br />
The room filled with an eerie warmth, which reminded me vaguely of springtime in Ontario. But no &#8212; it could not be &#8212; the sun did not shine in Vancouver, it was not meant to happen!<br />
But as I rose, holding my hands over my eyes, I could see that I was wrong &#8212; the sun had bled through the ever-thinning clouds. The sun, giver of life, and burner of skin. It had not given up on our poor, soggy souls! The sun was out, the birds were singing, it was a completely beautiful day!<br />
So we decided to go see a movie.<br />
(Hey, how much sun do you think we can take after four months of rain?)<br />
All kidding (and over-done prose) aside, it was a very unusual weekend. The sun was out, and a lot of the cold and wetness that has plagued us here for the past four months (at least temporarily) went away. Taking advantage of a nice day, we did opt to go see a movie.<br />
It was &#8220;Babe: Pig In The City&#8221;. I highly recommend it, along with it&#8217;s predecessor, &#8220;Babe&#8221;. Very good movies. The movie cost $1, which was the only real reason we went.<br />
To get there, we had a nice, long drive into Coquitlam. It was a beautiful day, with blue sky, white-capped mountains, and surprisingly little traffic (at least until we got to Coquitlam).<br />
The following day, we decided to do something even bolder &#8212; we went biking. Unfortunately, Sunday&#8217;s weather wasn&#8217;t quite as nice. It was a little cloudier, and a little cooler, but it was still much better than normal. Although I&#8217;m hesitant to say it, things are beginning to look a lot less like Christmas, and a lot more like Canada Day.<br />
Now if we can just do something about Eastern Canada&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There&#8217;s only so much rain you can take before you start to go a little strange in the head. It has rained here nearly every single day since 1 Nov 1998. We&#8217;ve had about 10-15 days in that stretch where it didn&#8217;t rain, and about five days where we actually saw that big bright yellow circle in the sky. And Heaven forbid we should think that the colour of sky is anything but grey!<br />
Thus, I need not explain why Allison and I wanted to see something different for a change.<br />
So we went to Seattle.<br />
Why Seattle? Simple &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t been there before. It would be a change of pace, and (hopefully) something out of the ordinary. After all, you can only stare at the 33 walls of your apartment for so long&#8230;<br />
We piled into the car bright and early Saturday morning, maps in hand, and headed for the border (with a brief pit stop at McDonald&#8217;s to ease the rumblings in our stomachs). The traffic at the border was a bit heavy, but neither of us were too upset. It took only a few minutes to traverse the border, convince the US Border Patrol we were harmless, and be on our way.<br />
The trip to Seattle is about three hours, depending on how bad the traffic in Seattle is. (And even on a weekend, it&#8217;s pretty bad.) The trip&#8217;s a little dull too &#8212; the terrain is pretty flat. The rain and fog obscured all the interesting things to look at, so we had to entertain ourselves in conversation.<br />
I regularly find it amazing that despite all the time Allison and I spend together, we can always find new things to talk about.<br />
When we arrived in Seattle, we arrived in Seattle traffic. I hadn&#8217;t seen traffic that heavy since I lived in Oakville and drove into Toronto. And this was a weekend! Rush hour must be a complete nightmare.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we spotted the Space Needle, and went about figuring out how to get off the I-5, and into the city. Luckily, Americans are fairly good at marking signs. We exited the I-5, and found our way to Mercer Drive. This cuts a somewhat quasi-diagonal path through the north-eastern end of town, taking you by the Expo &#8217;62 site (complete with that so-called &#8220;tower&#8221;, the Space Needle), and eventually putting you near the waterfront. Arriving on Elliott Street, we turned left and proceeded to attempt to find parking.<br />
Folks, if you decide to drive to Seattle, make sure you have small American bills when you arrive downtown. Parking there is expensive (often brutally so), and unless you have small American bills, you might find it very difficult to find a place to park. A lot of the lots require you to place a rolled up bill into a slot. Other take the bills and issue a ticket (and have major problems with CIBC VISA cards).<br />
After nearly an hour of trying, we eventually found a lot where we could park for US$8. We weren&#8217;t exactly ecstatic about the price, but we didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The immediate agenda after that was to find lunch.<br />
By the time we finished eating at a cheap (albeit not only in price, but also in quality) Chinese restaurant, we decided it was time to actually go see *something*. So we walked up a street, turned a few corners, and arrived at Pike&#8217;s Place Market. Or rather, the staircase going up.<br />
Seattle is quite hilly. It&#8217;s not as hilly as San Francisco, but it&#8217;s much hillier than Vancouver. There are several staircases running from the waterfront to the top of the hill. (I would learn later that there was a reason for all that.)<br />
Once we reached the top (a little winded from all the climbing), we headed into the market. Pike&#8217;s Place Market (also known as the &#8220;Public Market&#8221; if you see the huge neon signs) has been there for quite a long time. It has just about every imaginable shop, selling fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers (fresh and dried), home-made chilli, doughnuts, flying fish, stained glass &#8230;<br />
Flying fish? Oh yes, there are flying fish in Pike&#8217;s Place.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s a store called Pike Place Fish, and they have a rather interesting method of getting the fish from the ice-packed display to the packers behind the counter.<br />
They throw them.<br />
I kid you not. You&#8217;ll suddenly hear a loud: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; from a large guy dressed in orange hip waders, quickly followed by a chorus of people behind the counter, all shouting: &#8220;Large chinook salmon!&#8221; (they do this for every order, fish or otherwise), followed by a real large chinook salmon, flying through the air, from the large guy dressed in orange hip waders to another person behind the counter.<br />
Needless to say, this attracts a lot of spectators, most of whom want to see the flying fish. Apparently, sales are more brisk during the summer. (Tourists are such gullible people.) You can check them out on the Internet, at <a href="http://www.fishthrowers.com/">http://www.fishthrowers.com</a>.<br />
After viewing the sailing salmon, we continued our way down the length of the market to see what objets d&#8217;art were available. Most of it was produce, which is not at all a bad thing &#8212; there&#8217;s nothing like smelling fresh vegetables and fruits and flowers.<br />
Towards the end of the market, we came across a table where a man was selling home-made stained glass kaleidoscopes. We probably wouldn&#8217;t have stopped were it not for the fact that a neighbour of my family in Oakville makes almost the same thing. The design of the simpler kaleidoscopes was almost exactly the same, and the more complicated ones were very similar. (My family&#8217;s neighbour is one up on this man, though &#8212; he makes a binocular kaleidoscope that is just a wonder to see.)<br />
I made some quick inquiries. The cheap triangular scopes were about US$30. The more complicated ones with dials and spinning vials of beaded glass were about US$50, and the really nice pieces were US$120 and up. My family&#8217;s neighbour could probably make a killing&#8230;<br />
Reaching the end of the market, we hopped across the street and entered the Mecca of the West Coast &#8212; the original Starbucks Coffee Shop. Founded in 1971, it&#8217;s served countless cups of caffeine to the masses, and marketed itself into world dominance.<br />
They screwed up our cups of hot chocolate. They forgot the whipped cream.<br />
After walking around a little and snapping a few pictures, Allison went to purchase a dried garlic and flower wreath for hanging on our kitchen wall. (We needed a little more decoration in there.) Not wanting to carry the fragile decoration with us for the rest of the day, I quickly ran it back to the car.<br />
Upon returning to Allison, we headed down 1st Street to Pioneer Square, the original centre of Seattle, and the location of Doc Maynard&#8217;s. We were in search of the Seattle Underground Tour.<br />
What&#8217;s underground Seattle? Rocks, mud, a few bodies, but mostly dirt. All except for a 22-block area in Pioneer Square, what was originally Seattle.<br />
As we would learn over the course of the tour, Seattle used to be built on mudflats. No problem with that, except that twice daily your house flooded. It got worse when they installed Crappers (toilets as they were known in the 1890s) &#8212; twice daily, toilets on the flats would explode, creating six-foot high geysers from the &#8216;loo. Not exactly the sort of thing you want.<br />
To solve a large number of problems, the citizens did the only thing they could &#8212; they burnt the city to the ground. Okay, they didn&#8217;t actually do that on purpose, it kind of happened when a glue jar caught fire. It fell onto a turpentine-soaked floor. Of a shop built mostly of wood. The next door neighbour was a warehouse &#8230; filled with whiskey. I think you get the idea&#8230;<br />
The first ordinance passed required that all buildings be made from 60% non-flammable materials. Luckily for the town, the mayor owned the local brick works.<br />
One of the next things they did was plan to raise the roads. Chuckholes (essentially a killer pothole) were becoming so bad, the only way to solve the problem was to literally cover the roads &#8230; with upwards of 32 feet of soil. So they began to solve the problem, by raising all the buildings, then raising the road, then building the sidewalks.<br />
Sound a little weird? Well, that&#8217;s how Seattle got its underground. When the roads were raised, there were huge gaps between the road and the buildings. When those gaps were eventually covered with a sidewalk, the areas underground were abandoned. That was 1907. It wasn&#8217;t until the 1960&#8217;s, when local historian Bill Speidel opened the underground for a tour. Because of his efforts, the Underground (and the surrounding area) is now a protected historical area.<br />
At least, as much as Americans will actually protect that kind of thing &#8230; especially when there&#8217;s a profit to be made by paving over paradise, and putting up a parking lot.<br />
The tour was pretty cool &#8230; the tunnels aren&#8217;t heated. Sorry, cheap joke. We learned a lot about Seattle and its history, not to mention saw a lot of how Seattle was built one hundred years ago. It&#8217;s really fascinating &#8212; I recommend it to anyone going there.<br />
Following the tour, Allison and I went back to retrieve our car. Unlike all the other parking garages with reasonable hours (i.e. they never close), ours shut down at 20:00. Not exactly what I&#8217;d call convenient.<br />
After driving over half the city trying not to listen to Allison telling me the correct way out, we hopped back on the I-5 and headed towards home. We had thought about staying the night, but when you took into account that hotels cost about US$90 a night, we thought of all the other things we could do with that $90, and opted to go home.<br />
The following day, we rose a bit later than usual (we were a little tired from our journey), and started to plan out our day. We thought it might be interesting to go through Lynden, the Dairy Capital of Washington State.<br />
Why? Why not? (Also because we thought that the Tulip Festival might be on, although we couldn&#8217;t find any confirmation of that.)<br />
After looping through Lynden a few times, we came to the conclusion that the town was really boring (nearly everything was closed) and we opted to have a bite to eat, and leave.<br />
One note to travellers to Lynden: Don&#8217;t eat at Bob&#8217;s Burger and Brew (I swear I&#8217;m not making the name up). Just trust me on that.<br />
Just as we began to leave Lynden, the weather started to act strange &#8212; heavy rain, very dark clouds, hail, and thunderstorms. One of the things about BC weather &#8212; it&#8217;s usually pretty tame. This was way out of the ordinary, and it had me a little worried &#8212; it looked like tornado weather. (Although I&#8217;m told we can&#8217;t get tornados here, the weather patterns seemed just ripe for an ol&#8217; Kansas vacuum.)<br />
Returning to Canada again, we headed into Surrey to find an area called Cloverdale. Inside Cloverdale is a subdivision (whose name has totally escaped me) that has Victorian-style homes. This has, apparently, become a popular trend in homes. After a little driving around, we stumbled across the subdivision, and drove in.<br />
Very nice homes, and it really looked like a nice neighbourhood. It&#8217;s the sort of place I&#8217;d like to live. But the original subdivision was all sold about a year or two ago, so we couldn&#8217;t actually check any of the places out.<br />
Luckily, there was a new phase being built just next door. There were two show homes available for viewing. All I can say is &#8212; very impressive. Allison and I were thinking we could skip going to Europe, and we could get jobs in Surrey (well, *I* could get a job in Surrey), and we could buy.<br />
When reality finally sank back in, we acknowledged that while we&#8217;d love to live there, we had too many other things we wanted to do first, and Europe was one of them. It was by far the best designed house we&#8217;d seen to date, and it had a lot of design features that we wanted to include in ours. Maybe one day&#8230;<br />
At any rate, we&#8217;re back to working on our lives. Hopefully, our next big adventure won&#8217;t be far away!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is an auspicious date for me &#8212; one year ago today, I started my new job, working for a company that makes video games. A year later, I&#8217;m still here, despite the difficulties Radical went through in October and the layoffs that followed. Frankly, I&#8217;m surprised that things have turned out they way they have.<br />
Speaking of new jobs, Allison has a new job as well. After countless (and some very strange) interviews, she started last Wednesday (10 February 1999) with InterLogic Engineering in Surrey as the Corporate Presence Guru. Okay, that&#8217;s not her *official* title, but I think that would be a good one.<br />
It was on her start day that I really began to hate snow. At least in Vancouver, that is. Well, actually, Vancouver itself isn&#8217;t that bad &#8212; it&#8217;s Burnaby, New Westminster, and Surrey I hate.<br />
Here&#8217;s what happened. It seems our old friend Murphy noticed that Allison was to start a new job, and Heaven forbid that she have an easy time of it. So he made it snow. A lot. We woke up that morning to a few inches of snow. That in itself wouldn&#8217;t be so bad &#8212; except that no-one here knows what to do with it. (And it doesn&#8217;t help that there&#8217;s no-one here who knows how to remove it.)<br />
Allison doesn&#8217;t like driving in the snow here, especially in her car (it&#8217;s a small Toyota). Considering all the morons in SUVs (sports utility vehicles) out here, it&#8217;s not unusual not to want to drive. Being the gentleman that I am (okay, you can all stop snickering now!), I offered to drive her to work.<br />
Normally, the trip is about 30 minutes. We left at about 7:40 so Allison could be at work for 8:30 (that her start time). By 8:00, we were just beginning to inch our way over the bridge into Surrey &#8230; and saw the line of 10,000 cars trying to climb a teeny-tiny little hill. Of course, the hill was covered in a nice sheet of ice.<br />
Realising that we weren&#8217;t going to get anywhere fast, I whipped out my trust map of the Lower Mainland, found a detour, and promptly ended up looking at another hill. Allison had always complained of how &#8220;flat&#8221; Surrey was &#8212; I was, not surprisingly, annoyed when she told me that there were hills in Surrey. The hills never seem to count when it&#8217;s dry and free of snow&#8230;<br />
Anyway, I turned around to go back to the 10,000 car pileup, and accidentally turned down the wrong road. This turned out to be a very fortuitous accident &#8212; it led us up a nice, relatively clear road, and got us around the lineups.<br />
Just after 9:15, we pulled into InterLogic&#8217;s parking lot, and Allison quickly headed inside. It was now my turn to go to work, and there was no way I was going to drive there. I left my car in the parking lot, hopped a taxi, and caught the SkyTrain. An hour later, I pulled into work.<br />
Again, I repeat &#8212; it sucks when it snows here.<br />
On the weekend, we travelled over to the Island to visit with family, most notably for Allison&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s birthday. He turned the fresh young age of 80, and seemed quite happy to see his family all around him.<br />
For the event, we went to The Grotto, a restaurant that was noted for great food. This much was true &#8212; the food was pretty decent. The management, however, was the worst I have ever had the displeasure to experience. They didn&#8217;t seem to understand the concept of &#8220;customer satisfaction&#8221;.<br />
Allison&#8217;s aunt made a reservation at the restaurant a month or so in advance (it was, after all, the day before Valentine&#8217;s). She wanted to make sure that we would have seating for all 14 of us. Funny how they didn&#8217;t have 14 menus set aside&#8230;<br />
That was the first problem. It took 20 minutes to round up 14 menus. But it got worse. It took 30 minutes to get six appetizers. Six. Not 14, six. Something doesn&#8217;t add up there. Letting that slide, we had to wait another 30 minutes for our meals, and even then &#8212; we only got half of them. Moreover, the guest of honour (Grandpa Vailmont) was served last! Even a special order we had placed a day earlier (steamed vegetables for Grandma Vailmont) when unfulfilled. It took another 10 minutes to receive the last of the meals.<br />
Needless to say, there were several of us who were ticked off. Allison and I made a point of talking to the manager. The manager tried to claim that there were &#8220;too busy&#8221;, and deferred to whom we assume is her daughter (or possibly her granddaughter). Neither of them would apologise for the screw-ups, and in fact tried to blame the whole thing on us! How dare we bring so many people to their restaurant!<br />
Ten minutes later, Allison and I walked out with a $40 gift certificate, and a promise that we&#8217;d never go back &#8212; we never even got an apology. We didn&#8217;t want the gift certificate &#8212; we wanted to hear: &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry&#8221;.<br />
At lunch today, I met with my cousins, Pam and Darren. Darren works here in Vancouver, but tends to travel from Peru to the Arctic on a semi-regular basis (ah, the joys of being a globetrotting geologist). Pam works for Petro-Canada in Calgary, but had come out for a visit. We spent a rather long (and very pleasant) lunch at the Yaletown Brewery.<br />
That&#8217;s about all there is from this neck of the woods for now. The rain has stopped, but the winds are still blowing. (Lousy La Nina!) Hopefully spring will start soon.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last night, Allison&#8217;s sister Jane returned from Europe (see [[Weekend in Calgary, Banff (Bamf!)]]), having spent the past seven and a half months in England (and Greater Europe). I remember being quite jealous at the time that she was going &#8212; she was doing what I&#8217;ve wanted to do for a few years.<br />
It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not going to be able to do in not too distant a time &#8212; once I&#8217;m married, I can&#8217;t go off for a year on my own. It&#8217;s making me really realise how much I liked being on my own while I was at university. Not having to answer to anyone (except professors, and later, my employers) was pretty handy.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Allison &#8212; I wouldn&#8217;t give her up for all the tea in China. Hmm&#8230; bad analogy &#8212; I hate tea (except green tea, I love green tea &#8212; especially after a really nice batch of sushi, with tekka, maki, and maybe California &#8230; I&#8217;m not big on BC rolls yet &#8212; the salmon skin kinda turns me off from them). Oh, I&#8217;ve got a good analogy &#8212; I&#8217;d just as soon dump all my material possessions (i.e. the home theatre, the CDs, and my computers). Those of you who know me (i.e. if you&#8217;re reading this, you should know me, otherwise I don&#8217;t know what you received this) realise what that means, I hope.<br />
Okay, now that I&#8217;ve gone all gushy, time to get back on topic &#8230; whatever it was.<br />
Oh yeah &#8230; Jane returning home. So, Allison and I are standing in the airport, staring at the TV monitor trying to figure out which of the hundreds of people exiting the customs area is in fact her sister. Allison was asking *me*, who had only met her sister at most THREE times before, if it was her. (Of course, this was because I had a better view of the monitor.)<br />
The surprising part was that I did recognise her when she came out. Her white jacket was a bit grungier, her hair was different, and her eyes had the gleam of someone who had seen the world but not slept enough to look quite alert &#8212; but it was Jane, only now it was Jane, World Conqueror.<br />
I felt kinda weird. This was (at most) the fourth time I had seen my future sister-in-law. The last time had been in April of 1998. Since then, Allison and I had grown much closer, moved in with each other, travelled to Calgary, California, New York, and Toronto, gotten engaged, and started to plan a wedding. Jane&#8217;s (and Allison&#8217;s) parents know me quite well (to the point where they talk to me on the phone &#8212; not to be just polite, but they are genuinely interested &#8230; or at least they seem to be), and her brother Randy and I have conversations (albeit brief ones &#8212; Randy doesn&#8217;t really stop moving around for too long).<br />
Poor Jane &#8212; she had a near-total stranger lunge up and hug her as she arrived home.<br />
I made an effort to talk to her, but at the same time, I preferred that Allison do most of the talking &#8230; I figured that a voice Jane was familiar with would be more comforting. I feel like I know Jane fairly well, but that&#8217;s mostly because of Allison and her parents. In reality, I barely know her.<br />
I&#8217;m still finding it strange realising that there&#8217;s another family that I&#8217;m becoming a part of, where they acknowledge me as more than some guy Allison hangs around with. Oh well, I guess these are things I&#8217;m just going to have to get used to as life goes on. And what a life it&#8217;s turning out to be&#8230;</p>
