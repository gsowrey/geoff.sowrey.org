	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The fallout from the round of layoffs a week and a half ago came to a rather disappointing end &#8212; one of our lead programmers decided he didn&#8217;t want to work for corporate America, and quit. Just as the game he was working on entered the final development stages. I still can&#8217;t believe that the Powers That Be could not see that coming. I suspect that Rory and Ian (the two driving forces of the company) predicted something like this would happen, but the final decision came from the States. Convenient that they don&#8217;t really have anything to do with this office.<br />
Then Marketting (also located in San Francisco) decided to get into the act. Earlier in the week, a couple of press releases got around about the deal Radical has with ESPN (we&#8217;re making video games for them). One of our investors, who writes a column for BC Technology, decided he&#8217;d start spewing out to the entire planet about the neat things we were doing.<br />
Problem: No-one was supposed to know until today.<br />
So Marketting decided they&#8217;d send around a message that pointed us at a rather heavily made-up internal website that warned employees about talking to the press. (They didn&#8217;t mention a thing about boneheaded investors.) That was mildy degrading. Two days later, we received the hard copies. Four-colour print on expensive-feeling paper. One copy for each person. Nice waste of money, especially so close to layoffs, eh?<br />
It turns out that the flyers were approved and printed before the financial crunch, but I still think that the idea to hand them around was extremely poor. Many people in San Francisco wonder if all of Vancouver hates them. I can safely say we don&#8217;t hate all of them &#8230; just selected people.<br />
Onto different things&#8230;<br />
I got out this weekend. I had originally decided to go out and get a haircut. I haven&#8217;t had a haircut in about three months, so it&#8217;s looking a little scraggly. (I don&#8217;t buy into the ol&#8217; &#8220;haircut every four weeks&#8221; baloney &#8212; that&#8217;s a ploy by the hairdressers of the world to make more money. Same applies for showering daily, which is really only needed unless you&#8217;re dirty or you smell bad.)<br />
Didn&#8217;t make it that far. Allison immediately suggested that we could go to White Rock. Having read a little about it, and not having been there yet, I thought it a good idea. So we hopped in my car, and took off in the general direction of the former resort town.<br />
Finding it was another issue. Although I knew approximately where White Rock was, I had no idea exactly how to get there. Neither did Allison, although she had a much better idea of where it was. We drove across the Knight St. bridge, and drove through Richmond. We eventually found ourselves in Delta, trying to find out way into Surrey. (White Rock is at the south end of Surrey.) Once we entered Surrey, I decided that it would be a good idea to get a roadmap. (Hey, I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who drives aimlessly for hours without asking where I&#8217;m going.)<br />
About 45 minutes or so after leaving home, we found the main drag in White Rock. We drove along for a short distance, and pulled into a parking lot at the side of the road. You could tell we were in a tourist trap &#8212; the parking cost a dollar an hour.<br />
We crossed the railway tracks (Burlington Northern runs a line between White Rock&#8217;s building and beach, a left-over from the heady days of being a resort town, I suspect) and walked towards the wharf, about a kilometre away. (We could have parked closer to the wharf, but we didn&#8217;t know exactly where we were.)<br />
Along the way, we ran into the White Rock, from which the town received its name. It&#8217;s a large boulder of white granite, an erratic left over from the days of the glaciers. Since White Rock was founded, the boulder has received a few coats of white paint, usually from the local graduates.<br />
The wharf (pier, boardwalk, whatever you want to call it) extends into Shemiamoo Bay about a half kilometre or so. At the end are a lot of people fishing, but mostly crabbing (throwing in crab cages and attempting to catch dinner).<br />
We wandered back through the town for a while, before I darted back to retrieve the car. (The parking meter was running low, and Allison&#8217;s new shoes weren&#8217;t exactly co-operating with her feet.) When I returned, I was met with a freight train that rolled along the tracks, (presumably) heading towards Vancouver.<br />
We stopped for a quick snack at an ice cream shop, and took a moment to relax somewhat (we had walked quite a while that morning). Having had our fill of White Rock (it doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; White Rock&#8217;s is quite small), we opted to travel further west along the shore.<br />
Our ultimate destination was Point Roberts. If you follow the western shoreline of Delta south, you pass by Tsawwassen, a major ferry terminal, just before you reach the 49th Parallel, and the end of Canada. But right at that point isn&#8217;t the end of the land &#8212; it actually goes just a bit further south, and into the United States.<br />
In 1854, after many years of arguments between the United States and Britain (who held domain on the western side of the Dominion of Canada), the border was extended across the 49th Parallel until it reached the Georgia Strait, where it dipped slightly to accomodate Fort Victoria, at the south end of Vancouver Island. Originally, the Americans had wanted the border to allow them access right up the coast to Alaska (then-President Polk was elected on the slogan &#8220;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&#8221;), but eventually the Americans and the British agreed on the treaty of 1827, setting the border at the 49th Parallel. Because Point Roberts wasn&#8217;t on the oceans, it became cut off from Canada.<br />
But you&#8217;d never know. Pretty much the entire 4.9 square mile peninsula caters to Canadian interests. There are many beach homes (which sell for as little as US$50,000), and the area is almost completely undeveloped. But most amenities are available, and some of the municipal services (water, hospital) come from neighbouring Canada. The grocery stores take Canadian money with no question. And due to the relative tight security (you have to go through a border crossing when entering and exiting Point Roberts), the crime rate is also very low.<br />
We didn&#8217;t stay too long. Just enough to buy some cheap cheese, and fill up on cheap American gas. We thought we might even stay for dinner, but Point Roberts isn&#8217;t exactly known for its good food. We headed home, but ended up in Richmond to eat at Antonio&#8217;s, a tasty pasta bar.<br />
On Sunday, Allison and I made a quick spin of Metrotown, so we could obtain some free shorts, and peruse the haircutting establishments (none of which I was at all thrilled with). I then pretty much resigned myself to cleaning up my apartment. Having acquired some furniture from IKEA earlier in the week, I was determined to try and clean up my apartment a little.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Well, this is my first crack at a proper Branch entry. Hopefully these will go as well as I hope they do&#8230;<br />
My weekend got off to a bit of a rocky start &#8212; my company laid off 12 people in our Vancouver office. The CEO and CFO of our company (both from our San Francisco office) came up to inform us of the situation. The two driving forces of the company, Ian and Rory (the guys, who IMHO are the men behind the curtain) broke the bad news, and the CEO and CFO put the spin on it.<br />
Now I know why I didn&#8217;t like working for Corporate America &#8212; the spin. I hate spin. I like hard, cold, unsugared facts. I have to give Rory and Ian their credit &#8212; they know their staff well. The CEO on the other hand, well, he needs to be here a little more often to understand us, I guess. All I know is that I wasn&#8217;t the only one who thought his presentation was a little too slick.<br />
On Friday, Allison and I decided we&#8217;d head to Nanaimo for the long weekend. Allison had not been home since our last excursion at Easter, and wanted to go home for a short while. I, too, wanted to go, because it would allow me to get out of the city for a brief period of time. (I don&#8217;t care what anyone says &#8212; a change of scenery is a must from time to time.<br />
Allison picked me up at the office just after 12:00 on Friday afternoon. Our first destination was Granville Island, so we could visit the market. Our plan was to bring over all the goodies needed to have a good west coast barbecue.<br />
Following a brief lunch, we looked around at the various shops. We purchased vegetables (asparagus, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes), fruit (strawberries), bread (sourdough), salmon steaks wild sockeye), and a bottle of a not-too-dry white wine. The whole shebang came out to around $40. (The salmon and wine accounted for most of the cost.)<br />
By the time we left, we found we would be hard-pressed to get to the ferry at Tsawassen in time. So we opted for the Horseshoe Bay ferry. One minor problem: We weren&#8217;t the only ones with that idea.<br />
By the time we got to Burrard, the street was backed up. It took over 10 minutes to crawl a few measly blocks. Georgia was even worse &#8212; traffic was solid for several blocks. But when we finally cleared the entrance to Stanley Park, the flow began to speed up. However, it was already 14:10, and we had to be at the ferry no later than 14:40 &#8230; if we were lucky enough to find parking.<br />
We had not been able to beat the rush to the long weekend, which was clearly evident by the very long lineup for the ferry. It looked like a three or four sailing wait for some people. Since Allison and I were aiming to be walk-ons, we were able to scoot down into Horseshoe Bay to look for a parking lot. Luck shone on us that day &#8212; we got one of the last spots.<br />
Despite some communication problems, we managed to contact Allison&#8217;s parents. They picked us up at the ferry, and we went to the Collins&#8217; for dinner. Luckily, they hadn&#8217;t started to make dinner yet. It was barbecue night.<br />
The next day, Allison and I thought we&#8217;d do some driving. Mrs. Collins suggested Cathedral Grove, which is a rather famous patch of old-growth forest near the very middle of the Island. Mr. Collins thought Coombs would be a nice stop along the way. Mrs. Collins then started to tell Allison about the new interchanges in the area &#8230; then promptly decided that the four of us should go on the trip. I had no objections.<br />
We stopped along the way at Rathtrevor beach, so I could see what a good tidal beach looked like. I don&#8217;t know how far out that beach went, but it looked like a half-kilometre. At high tide, the beach would completely vanish. All I could think was that the beach would be immense fun in the summer.<br />
We proceeded north to Parksville, where we turned onto the Port Alberni Highway, and headed west. Not too far from Parksville, we entered Coombs, a little town in the Island interior. Coombs probably used to be nothing more than a mining or logging town. Today it has a thriving little tourist business, formed around the Coombs market. What&#8217;s so special about the market? It&#8217;s not every day you see a sod roof with real goats parading about.<br />
Soon we entered Cathedral Grove. It&#8217;s a provincial park that was created from land donated by H.R. MacMillian, a forester who founded HR MacMillian (part of MacMillian-Blodel industries, if I&#8217;m not mistaken). Yes, Her-mac (as one call it) is a logging company. Sounds a little weird for a founder of a company that has come under a lot of fire for logging old growth-trees to donate a small forest of old-growth trees for parkland, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, Mr. MacMillan was apparently a nice guy, and wanted the future to know what the past looked like. Public outcry also forwarded the cause.<br />
Cathedral Grove is aptly named &#8212; I have never in my life seen trees so large. But even trees so large are not immune to the environment. On Jan. 1, 1997, there was a tremendous windstorm that tore through the grove. It knocked over several trees and thousands of branches. Several parts of the forest floor were complete littered with timber. But none of it was cleaned out &#8212; the park is to remain almost completely untouched.<br />
On the way back, we stopped briefly in Coombs, to shop at the market, and look around. It&#8217;s a nice little market &#8230; with a few hundred people packed in. But it&#8217;s worth the drive &#8230; at least, I thought it was worth the drive.<br />
We had a late lunch in the restaurant, and wandered through the multitude of wares in the market. (Oddly enough, most of the wares were Mexican &#8230; a little strange, IMHO, considering the Native influences in BC.) I purchased two very large Mexican hand-woven blankets (which are really warm). Allison bought a handful of paper mache vegetables for decoration.<br />
Returning home, we sat down to the task of making dinner. But even then, we didn&#8217;t eat until 20:00 or so. I offered to try and fix Mrs. Collins&#8217; email problems on her computer. She&#8217;d been having problems with the addressbook, and having multiple copies of Netscape floating around.<br />
The next day we rose early to go see the Victoria Day Parade. The Victoria Day Parade is a big thing out here. Few places in Ontario (only Ottawa comes to mind, and apparently Orillia also carries on the tradition) have a formal parade. In Ontario, the Victoria Day Weekend is more commonly known as the &#8220;May Two-Four&#8221; (the weekend was traditionally around May 24th, and a case of 24 beers is known as a &#8220;two-four&#8221;). It&#8217;s essentially the start of the cottage season in Ontario.<br />
We arrived downtown at about 10:40, expecting the parade to start at 11:00 (which was what we were led to believe). However, we noticed that there were still a lot of cars on the parade route, not all the reviewing stands had been completed, and we were the only people standing around. Mr. Collins soon found out that we had come too early &#8212; the parade didn&#8217;t start until 13:00.<br />
So we went wandering down on the waterfront. It was a nice day, albeit a little chilly from the wind. The weekend had brought a small amusement park to the waterfront (where just attractions appear during festive weekends). We had a batch of less-than-satisfactory french fries (they left a horrible taste in my mouth, and neither Allison or I were feeling too good as a result).<br />
At about 12:45, we headed back to the road to see the parade. When we arrived, the crowds that I had been expecting had appeared. Just after 13:00, the first sign of the parade went by &#8212; a fire truck. I had forgotten what community parades were like. It had been so long since my last one.<br />
I found out after the weekend that one of my co-workers, Greg Mayer, had been on the Hungarian Cultural float (it won for best Cultural Presentation, and Best Presentation Overall). We had somehow managed not to see each other.<br />
We had to hurry back to the Collins&#8217; to go to a family barbecue with Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents. We were sidetracked temporarily at home. Allison wasn&#8217;t feeling well, and had to lie down for a while before continuing out again.<br />
The barbecue was great &#8212; Mrs. Collins had made a potato salad that was exactly like the one my mother makes. It was like being at home. We ate until there was no food left to eat, and then ate some more. Dessert was a berry mix on a sponge cake, with whipped cream. Very tasty. Mostly considering that until this weekend, I didn&#8217;t eat berries. Things just keep changing&#8230;<br />
After dinner, we went inside where Allison and I watched the last episode of Murphy Brown. It was sad to see such a good show go, but it was a good last episode. Between Murphy Brown and the X-Files (which came on later), we went into the kitchen to make &#8220;stamps&#8221;. These were pieces of paper that you stamped with ink, and then sprinkled a special glitter overtop. Using a heater, you melted the glitter to make the stamp. It was fun. I won a prize.<br />
Then the final episode of the X-Files came on. Well, the final one that was filmed in Vancouver, anyway. (For we Canucks, it might as well be the final one.) I felt bad because I pretty much had the entire family in the living room watching a show that really didn&#8217;t seem to appeal to anyone. It was only a plot-builder for the movie being released this summer.<br />
Following the movie, the Collins and I made a hasty retreat back to the waterfront to watch the fireworks. Unfortunately, we were late in arriving, and the fireworks had already started. As a result, we didn&#8217;t get out of the car. On the bright side though, we managed to be the first car out of there, and missed all the traffic. I felt bad again for making everyone miss the start of the fireworks.<br />
I tried to amend for my selfishness by buying coffee (and hot chocolate) and donuts (and muffins) for the Collins on our way back home.<br />
The next day, the weather couldn&#8217;t make up its mind. It was either rainy or somewhat sunny &#8212; there was no comfortable medium. We left late in the afternoon, catching the 16:30 ferry from Departure Bay. For those of you who know the ferry schedule, yes, that is not a standard ferry time. Extra ferries were running to cope with the traffic.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Once again, I&#8217;ve left writing too long, and probably forgotten details of the events of my life. So if I forget anything, I apologise in advance&#8230;<br />
A couple of weeks ago, I decided it was high time that I started taking matters in my own hand &#8230; namely, I needed some exercise. I wasn&#8217;t getting out enough, and I was really afraid that I&#8217;d lose my figure. So it was time to start biking.<br />
My goal was to bike to and from work every day, rain or shine. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the only person &#8212; a good portion of Vancouverites engage in such activity, and it&#8217;s so popular at Radical, that we even have a dedicated bike storage room. (And having showers available certainly entices one all the more.)<br />
Some of you may remember that I made such a boast last year, when I said I would bike from Oakville to Toronto every day. Poor pathetic me didn&#8217;t realise just how far away Toronto was. I biked once, then left my bike there for about two months before bringing it home.<br />
But I said things would be different this time. So one evening, I ventured down to the locker room, pulled out my bike, and straightened out the handlebars (they were turned sideways when it was shipped out).<br />
The following morning, I make my first attempt to bike to work. I went across Grange to where it connected with Kingsway, briefly over to Boundary, and then proceeded north on Boundary to Adanac, which was the bikeway. It took me at least 15 minutes to get to Adanac.<br />
Despite the fact that a large portion of the trip to Adanac was downhill, I was wiped by the time I got there. I couldn&#8217;t believe how out of shape I was. And I still had to cross the city of Vancouver. I proceeded along Adanac, and felt ill to my stomach&#8230;<br />
The only bright point was that I had a shower waiting for me. And I really needed it too! When I went home that night, I went by MEC (Mountain Equipment Coop) to buy a new backpack. The one I have is for hiking, and is completely ill-suited for the purposes of biking. Similarly, my nylon briefcase is painful to wear for that length of time.<br />
When I resumed my riding the next morning, I found a new expression of pain in the saddlesores I had acquired. One does not get a full appreciation of how hilly it is here until one has to bike it.<br />
However, I persevered, to the point where I dragged Allison out on the Saturday for a bike ride around Stanley Park. Oh wow&#8230; I knew that Stanley Park was nice, but I didn&#8217;t think it was *that* nice. For all the reasons that I hated leaving Ontario, the ability to bike around Stanley Park outweighs a large chunk of them.<br />
That night, we went out with one of Allison&#8217;s friends (Rhona-Mae), who was leaving for home (High River, AB) the following day. We went to the Blarney Stone, where we wanted to throttle the doorman for not letting us in for almost an hour. Stupid nightclub politics&#8230;<br />
The following week was Hell Week for me &#8212; my group was putting out a new version of our 3D rendering system, and I had a lot of stuff to document. It was not a nice week at all. This culminated in a couple of nights where I got very little sleep. In one night, I slept about an hour. The next night I ended up sleeping at the office because I was behind in my deadlines.<br />
Allison and I are looking forward to the weekend. Unlike the infamous May Two-Four weekend in Ontario, we just have various festivals. We&#8217;re going to Nanaimo for the weekend, and a slew of barbecues. Ought to be fun&#8230;<br />
Yesterday, my work got flipped on its ear for a little while. I was happily working away, when I received a phone call. At first, I thought it was going to be Allison (we were planning to go see a movie). It was a familiar voice. My father&#8217;s.<br />
Immediately my brain began to have the following conversation:<br />
Left: It&#8217;s dad.<br />
Right: So?<br />
Left: Why would he be calling me?<br />
Right: Hmm&#8230; something important, no doubt. He doesn&#8217;t call otherwise.<br />
Left: He doesn&#8217;t sound upset.<br />
Right: True. Must be something else.<br />
Left: You don&#8217;t suppose&#8230;<br />
Right: Suppose what?<br />
Left: That he&#8217;s&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;in Vancouver?<br />
Left: Oh&#8230;<br />
Right: &#8230;S**t!<br />
Sure enough, dear ol&#8217; dad had appeared in Vancouver. Why? Because he decided to drive out. Confused? Good, &#8216;cuz I still am&#8230;<br />
You see, when I moved out here, I didn&#8217;t bring my car. I figured I would have it brought out when the time was right. I hadn&#8217;t needed it, so as far as I was concerned, it was a moot point. But my father had wanted to bring it out, dragging my poor mother along for the ride.<br />
So I started talking with my friend Joe, who was living in Toronto, and looking for a new job. I figured he&#8217;d be the perfect person to take my car for a ride. So I started into negotiations, prodding him, bribing him, all sorts of devious under-handed things to get him to drive my car here.<br />
And then my dad shows up with it. At least he didn&#8217;t bring my mother. She was safe at home.<br />
So needless to say, my evening went down the drain rapidly. On the bright side, my father, Allison, and I went out to dinner at the Yaletown Brewery. I figured he could use a couple of beers after the trip out. After that, I drove Allison home, and dad crashed in my bed.<br />
I stayed up to try and find him passage back home. Most of the major airlines wanted at least $1200 for a last-minute one-way ticket. This sort of thing really bothers me. If I call two weeks in advance, it&#8217;s $400. Why should the price rise so much? Lousy capitalism&#8230;<br />
This morning I woke up bright and early at 06:55 &#8230; an hour before I planned to get up. It seemed that dad thought I had to get up at that time. I guess my repeated suggestions that Vancouver time differs quite a bit from Toronto time had gone unnoticed. (I don&#8217;t normally get up until around 08:00.)<br />
My mother called a scant five moments later to tell me that Canada 3000 had deals on their airfare. I had to remind my mom that I wasn&#8217;t in Saskatchewan, and that BC is *three* hours behind, not *two*. (It wasn&#8217;t the first time that she had done that to me.) I made a quick arrangement and booked the flight.<br />
The three of us went out to dinner again, but this time to the Pink Pearl, a Chinese restaurant downtown. It wasn&#8217;t anything to wow about, but at least the food was good. I was a little annoyed at the price, though. I didn&#8217;t think the place would cost so much (it came out to just over $20 a person).<br />
Tomorrow, we dump dear ol&#8217; dad at the airport so he can wing his way back to Toronto. Allison and I are off to Nanaimo on Friday afternoon (I think). I hope everyone has a good weekend, and I&#8217;ll let you know what happened with mine!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This entry is long overdue &#8212; I should have issued this sometime last week. But it&#8217;s been one of those weeks where I&#8217;ve barely had time to check my email, let alone write any.<br />
It all started a few weeks ago, when I heard through the grapevine that my mother and my mother&#8217;s mother (to whom all the young&#8217;uns on this side of the family affectionately refer to as &#8220;Nana&#8221;) were going to be visiting my aunt and uncle in Calgary. This was a particularly good thing for me &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t seen my mother in a couple of months, I hadn&#8217;t seen Nana since early September, I hadn&#8217;t seen Aunt Brenda and Uncle Mike (not to mention my hyper little cousin Jennifer) since August, nor had I seen Pam since that time (she also lives in Calgary, but is the daughter of another part of the family), and I hadn&#8217;t seen Stuart or Therese since Christmas.<br />
No, Stuart and Therese aren&#8217;t a part of my biological family. They are however, two of my closest friends in the world &#8212; and are for all intents and purposes, my extended family. Having to shift from seeing them nearly everyday, to seeing them once every few months isn&#8217;t easy. And I&#8217;d been wanting to see them for quite a while, especially since they had bought two new siamese kittens.<br />
So I sat down and looked at the cost of airfare. Allison looked at the cheapest ways out there &#8212; by car, and by bus. She wanted to come (and I wanted her to come), but she didn&#8217;t have the money to pay for the $200 airfare. (We&#8217;d missed the seat sale requirements by one lousy day.)<br />
For a while, it looked like Allison wouldn&#8217;t be able to go. And I really wasn&#8217;t keen on going without her. But then luck shined upon the both of us &#8230; she &#8220;found&#8221; $800 in her bank accounts. As her father put it: &#8220;Only Allison could find $800.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know how she did it, but at that point, I didn&#8217;t care to find out.<br />
To ease our travelling (and get the cheapest airfare possible), we opted to leave early on Friday the 17th. Allison got the day off, and I just didn&#8217;t bother to go in (my office has such flexible time that I can decide not to come in one day, just so long as I make the time up at some point).<br />
We drove down to Richmond (where YVR &#8212; the Vancouver Airport &#8212; sprawls over Sea Island), and hunted for a cheap place to park Allison&#8217;s car. We found a lot at the Comfort Inn that charged only $3 a day. We had considered taking the bus, but we were coming back at 08:20 on the Monday, and Allison needed a quick (and inexpensive) way to work.<br />
We were flying WestJet, a small airline that offers really cheap airfare between cities in the west (they have extended as far as Winnipeg, but whether they&#8217;ll go any further is anyone&#8217;s guess). We checked in, got our tickets (WestJet doesn&#8217;t issue &#8220;real&#8221; tickets, only boarding passes, which have to be picked up the day of the flight), and went to have breakfast. (WestJet doesn&#8217;t offer meals on their flights, and we were starving.)<br />
The flight was quite nice &#8212; we flew in an arc over northern Washington State, recieving a wonderful view of area around Mount Baker, and we could see as far as Mount Ranier.<br />
We arrived in Calgary around 11:20. As we touched down, Allison noted that it was &#8220;rather flat&#8221;. The Calgary-bashing had started. We weaved our way through the terminal to the baggage claim, so I could get my backpack. While we waited, I inquired about taking a bus downtown.<br />
We had to meet my cousin Pam at her office. She had graciously offered us the use of her sofa-bed and even her car (which she barely used) during our stay in Calgary. I checked in with her, and arranged for a time.<br />
We hopped a bus, which took us down to the Whitehorn C-Train station. (The C-Train is Calgary&#8217;s LRT system, and is part-and-parcel of their transit system.) We took the train downtown to the approximate intersection where we found find Pam&#8217;s office building.<br />
My only gripe about Calgary is that the road systems are WAY too confusing. Downtown, everything is numbered &#8212; streets and avenues. If someone gives you the information backwards by accident, you could end up blocks away. To further complicate issues, downtown is also where the city is split up into quadrants &#8212; so the roads restart their numbering four times. Fortunately, we were always in the southern quadrants while looking for Pam.<br />
The Petro-Canada tower wasn&#8217;t hard to find, and surprisingly enough, neither was Pam &#8212; we ran into her after had a bite to eat for lunch. At first I didn&#8217;t recognise her &#8212; she seemed to have lost a little weight from the last time I saw her. (Then again, she had been wearing a thick sweater that time.)<br />
She gave us instructions, the keys to her apartment and her car, and the code to get into her building. We were off again, to find her illusive apartment. Her instructions weren&#8217;t exactly correct, we found ourselves dumped at a parking lot (and yes, we had followed those instructions correctly). A shift of two blocks east corrected that problem).<br />
Our first order of business was to see the family. Pam had warned us that they were out, and wouldn&#8217;t be back until 15:30 that afternoon. So we thought we&#8217;d take our time and look around a little. We decided to go for a drive in Pam&#8217;s car.<br />
In general, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of most Japanese cars &#8212; I don&#8217;t fit in them very well. (The problems with being a large person.) I had complained a few times about Allison&#8217;s Toyota Corolla, because it was small (for me &#8212; Allison kept saying I should make a concerted effort to be smaller). Pam&#8217;s Nissan Micra made me feel claustrophobic.<br />
The sun in the Prairies is bright. I had forgotten how bright &#8212; Vancouver&#8217;s sun is muted by the cloud cover. The both of us ended up buying sunglasses to counter the painful squinting.<br />
We arrived at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s house a little after 15:30 (after arriving early, finding no-one home, and then going off to purchase the aforementioned sunglasses). My aunt Brenda answered the door, motioned us to be quiet, and pointed at the kitchen. I boldly walked into the kitchen, plunked my bags down, and loudly announced &#8220;Hello&#8221;.<br />
Oh &#8230; did I mention that neither my mother or Nana knew that I was coming?<br />
My mother looked up at me, and there was an instant look of recognition in her face &#8230; quickly followed by the look that appears as the visual thought of something that is out of place. Surprise followed soon after. Nana, on the other hand, seemed completely overwhelmed by the seemingly unending surprises.<br />
Allison and I sat down and talked with my relatives for a while, during which various family members came and went. Eventually, it was our turn to leave. Our family night was planned for the following night, and I really wanted to see Stuart and Therese.<br />
We spent a little time at Therese and Stuart&#8217;s (trying mostly to get their two new kittens to come out from under the bed long enough so I could see them) before we decided to go out to dinner.<br />
Stuart suggested that we try Montana&#8217;s, a chain of steakhouses that had finally migrated to Calgary. Therese referred to it as &#8220;Stuart and Geoff food&#8221;, which I have to admit, I took some offense to. My diet has changed quite significantly since I arrived in Vancouver, and I tend not to eat all the things I used to.<br />
At any rate, the place was packed, and we ended up at Joey Tomatoes not too far away. It was a pretty decent meal all around. And it gave us a good time to sit and talk and visit.<br />
Afterwards, we went back to Stuart and Therese&#8217;s, where we continued to talk a while longer. Well, most of us talked a while longer. Therese kept dropping off. She works a lot at school, and it takes a lot out of her. One day, she&#8217;ll be able to stay up after midnight&#8230;<br />
When Allison and I arrived home that night, we were ultra-careful not to wake up Pam. The sofa-bed was already set up, and it didn&#8217;t take us long to go to sleep.<br />
The next day, Allison and I decided that we would visit Banff. Although we had both been there before (not at the same time), we wanted to visit again. In both cases, we had only a short time to look around, and Banff is one of those places you really need to see carefully.<br />
The trip out was uneventful &#8230; except we were wondering whether Pam&#8217;s Micra would make it intact. It was a peppy little car &#8230; going downhill. The hour-and-a-half drive was a little more than the car could take.<br />
But it was worth the drive. Banff was in full bloom (snow included), and was quite the sight to see. The tourists were mostly gone (I guess it wasn&#8217;t their time of the year anymore) &#8230; except for the throngs of people waiting outside of the Roots. We guessed that someone like Elvis Stojko or Ross Rebigilati was inside.<br />
We visited the Hot Springs (the wrong ones, so it turned out &#8212; the original hot springs were in a different location), the Banff Springs Hotel (I have to stay there at least one night in my life), and drove around in the town. Finally, we headed back to Calgary for dinner with the family.<br />
The next day, on a suggestion from my family, we visited Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump, an historical site in the southern portion of Alberta. In use for nearly 5,700 years, the buffalo jump was a cliff that natives used to kill large groups of buffalo.<br />
The museum is built into the side of the cliff, not too far from the location of the actual buffalo jump. Great care was taken in building the site, such that it wouldn&#8217;t affect the any of the archeological remains in the area. The design, combined with the unbelievable quality of the education, garnered the museum the honour of being a UNESCO site. It was worth the five hour round-trip.<br />
We asked Stuart to come along with us, mostly because it would get him out of the apartment he shared with Therese. (Therese had to mark 40 20-page essays, and having Stuart around wasn&#8217;t exactly helpful.) Furthermore, I wanted to see as much of my friends as possible.<br />
The next morning, we had to catch our flight back to Vancouver. By that point, we had pretty much come to the conclusion that we could not live in Calgary. Allison had written off Calgary within a few moments of arriving (her first comment was: &#8220;It&#8217;s flat!&#8221;), but it didn&#8217;t take too long for me to realise that Calgary was no longer for me either.<br />
Having arrived in Calgary from Ontario, I found it very nice. But after living in Vancouver for nearly four months, I found Calgary&#8217;s appeal much lessened. I suspect that I shall have a hard time finding another place I love as much.<br />
And if you&#8217;re wondering just how I came to this conclusion, when I arrived back in Vancouver, not only did I feel more relaxed, but I felt like I was home. Not just back where I lived, but where I felt I should live.<br />
We then had the nasty task of attempting to find Allison&#8217;s car. We couldn&#8217;t remember the name of the company we had left it with. I knew it was a set of initials, but I couldn&#8217;t find them anywhere. We eventually remembered that the lot was at the Comfort Inn. It seemed that DPS, the people we left the car with, were known as Diamond Parking Services &#8230; everywhere except on their signs.<br />
On Sunday (the 28th), we delivered Allison&#8217;s sister, Jane, to the Hand of Fate &#8212; and the airport. Jane was moving to Europe. She had made the decision that she would live in Britain for a while &#8230; about a year.<br />
And she was not too excited about it either. Well, she was and she wasn&#8217;t. Most importantly, she was terrified. This was the first time she had been away from home. Mrs. Collins was almost as worried as Jane.<br />
I was envious. She was going somewhere I hadn&#8217;t been. I want to go to Europe. I&#8217;ve never been, and there&#8217;s so much to see. Perhaps one day I will go. Allison even hinted that we could visit with Jane.<br />
I wish her well, and hope that she has the time of her life. She will likely be a very different person when I meet her next. I only hope that life doesn&#8217;t jade her.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting few days. This weekend, as you already know, was Easter. This was the first time I was not in Ontario for Easter. I had been away from home before &#8212; usually on co-op terms (although university often did its fair share), but this was the first time that I was threatened with complete isolation from all friends and family.<br />
But I was saved by the graciousness of the Collins. They invited me to spend the Easter holidays with them. I, of course, accepted. I wasn&#8217;t interested in sitting in my lonely apartment all weekend.<br />
Allison and I left on Friday moring, catching the 12:30 ferry to Nanaimo. We went downtown to catch the 257 Horseshoe Bay Express. We didn&#8217;t want to take the car over &#8212; BC Ferries is in my opinion (and probably others) prohibitively expensive.<br />
We took the bus from the start of its route. This was Allison&#8217;s idea &#8212; and a very good one. When we got to the stop at the Bay on West Georgia, there were approximately a hundred people waiting. Our bus was full in a matter of moments.<br />
While we waited for people to board, someone knocked on the window. It was Jane, Allison&#8217;s sister. She was returning from the Arts Council Festival (or something like that), featuring Holly MacNarland and Great Big Sea. She was heading home for work. However, she would not be able get on our bus. BC Transit, however, is not for a lack of intelligence. They had another bus following ours, which picked up the remainder of the waiting passengers.<br />
The ferry traffic was heavy. Lots of cars, and lots of people. We made the sailing (so did Jane and her friend, Renata), which was 15 minutes late in leaving. During the crossing, we called Allison&#8217;s parents to inform them that there would be four of us, not just two. (This was important because we were to be picked up &#8230; and no matter how hard you try, you can&#8217;t pack six people into a Honda Civic.)<br />
That night was a quiet dinner with Allison, her parents, and her brother, Randy, when he arrived home from work. It was a roast of beef that came without yorkshire pudding or cheese sauce (for the broccoli), a result of Allison&#8217;s aunt Vicky appearing and staying too long. (Allison&#8217;s mom, who is Vicky&#8217;s sister, could not break away to continue with dinner.)<br />
Afterwards, we played Scrabble. It was a rather interesting game, mostly because the two English majors (Allison and myself) could not defeat Allison&#8217;s father. I could not remember the last time I had played, if ever.<br />
The next day, Allison took me around Nanaimo, showing me some of the different little townships that made up the whole city (and let me tell you &#8212; Nanaimo is a huge city). We went down to the waterfront (which apparently wasn&#8217;t a waterfront until a few decades ago &#8212; most of it was filled in), where the last bastion of the Hudson&#8217;s Bay Company remains presevered.<br />
We walked along the concrete and steel railed wharf, passing by such interesting things as the Javawocky, a little cafe. Most of the boats in the harbour (that we could see) were fishing trawlers. I didn&#8217;t know if there were in harbour because of the holiday, or were idled due to the drop in the fishing industry. Most looked in good condition, so I can only assume it was the holiday.<br />
We continued down to an artificial lagoon. which the city had built to enhance the waterfront. It created a small, sheltered beach, and calm water that remained even when the tide was low. Stray logs from the log booms that are towed through Georgia Strait had washed to the beach &#8230; or had been dragged there for character. On the other side of the lagoon was a large children&#8217;s playground, perhaps the most exciting looking one I&#8217;d ever seen. I wished I was 10 again.<br />
Not far away was a bronze statue of an ex-mayor who was &#8220;affectionately&#8221; known as &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. He was the man who invented the idea of the Bathtub Races (you only way you could *not* have heard about the Nanaimo Bathtub Race is if you&#8217;ve been living in a dark room for the past few decades). He dressed as a pirate (especially during said races), which is where he obtained the name &#8220;Black&#8221; Frank. However. as a mayor, he did some pretty questionable (and in a few cases, down-right unethical) things, so the name had more than one connotation.<br />
That night, we had a full turkey dinner (again, with a delayed Randy) with Grandma Collins, a wonderful woman who was an utter delight to have conversation with. She certainly didn&#8217;t strike me as the &#8220;typical&#8221; little old lady. She was more concerned with having fun.<br />
After dinner, Allison and I went out with Kelly, an old friend of Allison&#8217;s whom she hadn&#8217;t seen in over four years, and went to a pub downtown (nearly everything else closes down early in Nanaimo &#8230; even coffee shops) for a few drinks. None of us had anything alcoholic, but we were there for a couple of hours.<br />
The next morning was the day of the Easter Egg hunts. I can&#8217;t honestly remember the last time that the Easter Bunny visited my sister and I, but I can guess at it being many, many years. Well, it seems that the Easter Bunny is alive and well in Nanaimo &#8230; and he made many a visit this morning.<br />
First off was in the Collins household. It seems that there is a tradition, where the two resident rabbits (Mr. and Mrs. Collins) hide things in the kitchen. I was an unwitting inductee. Amongst various chocolates, I also received a t-shirt. I was extremely surprised (not expecting anything of the sort), and most thankful.<br />
Then it was off to Mrs. Collins&#8217; parents (less than a five minute drive) for lunch. That was, lunch after the Easter Egg hunt. (Yes, another one.) This time, the hunt was more elaborate. Everyone (except Mr. and Mrs. Vaillette &#8212; I apologise if the spelling is incorrect) had a plastic egg hidden somewhere around the tree. Inside the egg was a rhyme, which was our clue to the location of our prize (hidden by Brenna, one of Allison&#8217;s cousins).<br />
Needless to say, I think I was terribly well treated for an outsider. But you won&#8217;t hear me complaining!<br />
Well, there&#8217;s not much more at this point &#8230; more will come later on as I continue. But life resumes tomorrow &#8212; back to work, back to playing games.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>First and foremost, I apologise for not writing sooner. It&#8217;s been over a month since my last message, and I can safely say that in those four weeks, I&#8217;ve been so busy that I can group my life into three categories: Work, spending time with Allison, and sleeping. Those of you who know me can probably guess where the majority of my time was spent. (For those of you who don&#8217;t, the list is in order of time spent.)<br />
This means that I&#8217;ve had little time for the basic things, like shopping for food and laundry. Needless to say, email fell quite sharply in priority. But with things winding down (at least a little), I&#8217;m finding the time to write.<br />
What has kept me so busy? Well, if you&#8217;ll remember from one of my last messages, I was hired by Radical Entertainment (<a href="http://www.radical.ca/">www.radical.ca</a> &#8212; yes, the website&#8217;s pretty blaise, but apparently we&#8217;re working on it) as a technical writer. For those of you who missed it the first time, Radical makes video games.<br />
You&#8217;d think that working for a video game company means I play video games all day. Well, you&#8217;d be pretty much correct &#8230; at least when there&#8217;s a good Quake 2 deathmatch, or someone starts a game of Worms 2. And then there&#8217;s the previews of our own games, not to mention the zillions of demos we go through in a week &#8230; bla bla bla. Sounds pretty dull, doesn&#8217;t it?<br />
The week after I started, Tim (I seem to be cursed with bosses named &#8216;Tim&#8217;) gave me first big assignment: get the documentation ready for the next software release &#8230; two weeks later.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t sound too bad, does it? Well, allow me to provide some details. The team I work in is called &#8220;Pure3D&#8221;, and they&#8217;re the rendering gurus of the company. They write all the functions and libraries that all the game teams use to make video games. This means that I had to learn everything there was to know about computer graphics in a very short span of time. I also had to learn what all the software did, how to use it, and how to use the existing documentation format.<br />
Needless to say, the documentation didn&#8217;t meet with my satisfaction. The fact was, I simply didn&#8217;t have the time to do the job I wanted to do. Another month and a half, and I might have been able to straighten the whole thing out.<br />
Almost immediately following, I got drafted to do the Scientific Research and Experimental Development report so we could get a chunk of money back from the Feds. I had done one last year for Arkipelago, so I was familiar with the report. I just wasn&#8217;t ready for the sheer amount of work that Radical does in a year. The document stands at over 100 pages, and I&#8217;m still not done editing it.<br />
That has been the majority of my time for the past little while. It&#8217;s rather draining, but it&#8217;s also a lot of fun. And I know I&#8217;m getting satisfaction from the job. So all in all, I have nothing to complain about.<br />
All this means that I haven&#8217;t been getting out of Vancouver much. I didn&#8217;t even really do anything fun until last weekend, when Allison and I decided we&#8217;d look into (everyone brace yourselves for this) condos.<br />
Yes, condos. Glorified apartments. Condos are the most cost-effective real estate in the lower mainland &#8230; unless you&#8217;re rich and can afford the housing out here. Mind you, even after Allison and I looked around, we weren&#8217;t too impressed with the condos out here.<br />
In fact, we were so unimpressed, that we came to the conclusion that there was only one place we could live &#8212; Calgary. Vancouver&#8217;s too expensive, and Allison doesn&#8217;t like the suburbs. (Frankly, I agree with her.) So when it comes time for us to settle down, we have to leave.<br />
We did some calculations, and we found that no matter how we looked at it, living in Vancouver (condo or not) just wasn&#8217;t worth the money. We make sure of our ideas by popping onto a real estate database (www.mls.com) to see what we could find in Calgary. (If anyone&#8217;s interested, there&#8217;s some really nice properties in Banff for less than $200k.)<br />
Since then, we&#8217;ve also started considering Victoria. The only reason we&#8217;re a little apprehensive about Victoria is that it&#8217;s &#8230; well, quiet. Very quiet. Disturbingly quiet. It&#8217;s for the Just Wed and Nearly Dead, so I hear. Certainly feels that way too.<br />
We started looking ahead to vacations. We think we&#8217;re going to take two one-week vacations and explore the coasts of the US &#8212; east in late August, and west in late fall. But then again, we may go to Hawaii&#8230; We&#8217;re still thinking. There&#8217;s also Prince Albert National Park, where I can see my relatives, but that&#8217;s just a thought at this point&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Greetings from Lotus Land! (I still have no idea why people call it that &#8212; nowadays you could reefer to it as Grass Land &#8230; yes, I spelled &#8220;reefer&#8221; on purpose.)<br />
Undoubtedly you&#8217;ve all heard the trials and tribulations of Ross Rebagliati (sp?), the Canadian Snowboarding gold medalist. The whole thing wasn&#8217;t really played up too much around here, other than we thought that it was a really dumb thing to get worked up about. It all came down to punctuation for us:<br />
Rest of the World: They smoke marijuana in Whistler?<br />
British Columbia: They smoke marijuana in Whistler.<br />
(It&#8217;s not a question, it&#8217;s a fact. You could also have written our response a little more succinctly: &#8220;DUH!&#8221;)<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that jokes weren&#8217;t flying about &#8212; one had Ross as the new spokesperson for Hostess. (Y&#8217;know &#8212; &#8220;when you got the munchies&#8230;&#8221;)<br />
Life wound up at Prologic Corp. right on schedule, and I left on Friday without a hitch. And then it was off for the weekend.<br />
Allison and I made plans to spend Valentine&#8217;s day in Victoria. But first, we had to get to the island. At roughly 17:15, we departed the office, jumped in Allison&#8217;s car, and headed to Horseshoe Bay, which is roughly north-west of Vancouver. Although the ferry port at Tswassen (which is pronounced &#8220;swaa-sen&#8221; or &#8220;te-waa-sen&#8221;, depending on who you ask) was closer, there was a two sailing wait (there were *that* many cars waiting to leave &#8212; each ferry takes between 150 and 200 cars, and the sailings are at most once an hour), and we wanted to be in Nanaimo before 22:00, if possible.<br />
We arrived at Horseshoe Bay about 18:15 or so (yes, it took that long to get there). We purchased a ticket for the next sailing, which was 19:00. Unlike Tswassen, we wouldn&#8217;t have to wait.<br />
This was a good thing. The ferry takes a minimum of an hour and a half to get to the other side. We arrived in Nanaimo around 20:45 (counting the delays, and the loading/unloading time), and we promptly headed for Fast Eddies, a local favourite restaurant (best blackened chicken I&#8217;ve had outside of New Orleans!). We wanted to have dinner before descending on Allison&#8217;s parents.<br />
When arrived at the Collins family estate, Allison expressed her concern that she might not be able to sneak me inside &#8212; all the doors were locked. Why did she want to sneak me inside &#8212; several of her relatives were there. I was worried enough about meeting her parents, let alone a portion of her family tree (albeit a small portion &#8212; apparently Allison&#8217;s family tree is quite extensive).<br />
The introductions went quite well (I wasn&#8217;t immediately thrown out of the house, nor was I asked a great deal of embarrasing questions). Of course, I figured a way out of receiving the Evil Eyes &#8212; I brought a box of chocolates for Allison&#8217;s parents. When in doubt, go for the brownie points!<br />
(I&#8217;ve since found out that I&#8217;ve passed the &#8220;first test&#8221;. I&#8217;m somewhat apprehensive about the &#8220;second test&#8221;.)<br />
The conversation was not centred around me (thankfully), but it allowed me to get my foot in once in a while (I know families where you have to shout to be heard). But the family slowly weeded itself down until it was just Mr. and Mrs. Collins, Allison, and myself. Her sister Jane, who bears a striking resemblance to Kirsten Dunst (who appeared in such movies as Interview with the Vampire and Wag the Dog) showed up later, and promptly started downing a litre of cold pre-made cappaccino. Allison&#8217;s brother Randy appeared about a half hour afterwards.<br />
The next day we drove down the Island Highway (aka Canada Route 1, aka the Trans Canada Highway) to Victoria. Some parts of that trip were like travelling through a fairy tale &#8212; huge trees coated with deep green moss, huge cliffs dripping with lush vegetation &#8212; a rainforest without monkeys or macaus.<br />
Victoria was decidedly nicer than Nanaimo &#8212; namely, it wasn&#8217;t raining. We checked into the James Bay Inn (Victoria has a big thing about James Bay, for some strange reason), which was a block from the house Emily Carr was born in. We then decided to walk around Victoria.<br />
Victoria is a beautiful city &#8212; it reminds me very much of more European cities &#8212; Helsinki, most notably. I think it&#8217;s one of the smallest capitals in Canada &#8212; certainly the smallest west of Quebec (and south of the northern Territories). It&#8217;s also very relaxed. VERY relaxed. No-one seems in a rush (of course, all the horse-drawn carriages might attribute to that).<br />
We visited the Royal BC Museum (not as extensive as the ROM, but I think the collection of Native artifacts cannot be paralleled &#8212; except maybe by the Museum of Anthropology at UBC), which took us a couple of hours. Then we wandered over to a place called &#8220;Undersea World&#8221; (or some similarly cheesy name). It&#8217;s a building set into the harbour, with a few walls around the outside in the water. It&#8217;s an aquarium essentially, but the water&#8217;s right out of the bay (there are grates that open right into the surrounding water). The admission included a 15 minute scuba show where a diver showed off some of the various fauna of the deep.<br />
The most surprising thing I saw in that show was the conditioning of the fish &#8212; not the water conditioning, I mean the mental conditioning! I had always assumed (rather naively, so it seems) that the brain stems of fish were capable of only providing survival instincts &#8212; that fish couldn&#8217;t really &#8220;learn&#8221; things. The diver proved me very wrong. He pulled out a triangle (the kind you see in old westerns when Cookie calls the cowboys for dinner) and rang it. All the fish suddenly turned and gravitated towards him. Mondo creepy. Pavlov would be proud.<br />
We proceeded along the roads to see what there was to see, which included Chinatown, and Fan Tan Alley &#8212; the narrowest road in Canada. It&#8217;s about a metre wide. There are actual addresses (stores, specifically), so it&#8217;s a designated (complete with postal code) road. Parts of &#8220;Bird on a Wire&#8221; (filmed in 1990, starring Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn) were filmed in Vancouver and Victoria, including Fan Tan Alley.<br />
We had a very filling meal at a local Chinese restaurant in Chinatown (Note: Victoria&#8217;s Chinatown is less than a block, and is mostly for tourists). The service was lousy, but the food was great! The meal ended with the traditional fortune cookies. I had to laugh when I read my fortune: &#8220;Luck is coming your way.&#8221; (This is funny when you remember to read it the way you&#8217;re supposed to read fortunes.)<br />
The next morning (this morning), we toured around the city, where I made an effort to take a picture of the beginning of the Trans Canada Highway (yes kiddies, the TCH *starts* in Victoria &#8212; how&#8217;s that for trivia? Fool your friends!) We then wound our way to Craigdarroch Castle, built by millionaire coal baron (and all-round nasty guy) Robert Dunsmuir. Rumour has it that he blew up a mine full of workers (seven died) because of complains about the quality of life, the lack of wages, and so forth. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be too much sentiment for the guy.<br />
Finally, we headed back to Vancouver, via the Schwartz Bay ferry terminal. We barely missed making the ferry, and had to wait an hour until the next sailing. I will say one thing for the ferries in BC &#8212; they&#8217;re usually pretty nice, and the trip from Schwartz Bay to Tswassen is a beautiful one! I highly recommend it to anyone making the trip! (Nanaimo to Horseshoe Bay is mostly in open water, but gives you a great view of the mountains on a clear day).<br />
Anyhoo, this log is plently long enough for now. I now leave you to your regular activities&#8230;<br />
By the way, for those of you who don&#8217;t know the &#8220;real&#8221; way you&#8217;re supposed to read a fortune, you add &#8220;in bed&#8221; at the end. Believe it or not, most fortunes make more sense that way&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is the big day &#8212; I finally get my apartment, and I can make a trip to IKEA so I can put something in my apartment other than myself!<br />
At any rate&#8230;<br />
The weather out here has been really good lately. It&#8217;s been warming up (apparently spring starts in a couple of weeks!), I actually had my sandals on yesterday! (There&#8217;s something I wouldn&#8217;t be able to do in Ontario for at least a couple of months!)<br />
Ran across the border yesterday (we&#8217;re less than a half hour away, or so it seems). It seems very weird to go across the border without having to cross a bridge.<br />
Lots of good restaurants out here. Not having an apartment makes eating a little difficult, so we&#8217;ve been trying all sorts of interesting places. There&#8217;s a place in Kitsilano (down on the south side of English Bay) called &#8220;Naam&#8221;, which is an all vegetarian restaurant. I have to admit, whole almonds in a meal aren&#8217;t that bad&#8230;<br />
Then there&#8217;s &#8220;All India Foods and Sweets&#8221;, a small (but very busy) Indian restaurant. They&#8217;ve got a vegetarian buffet that&#8217;s a killer! Really spicy food all for $6! Can&#8217;t go wrong there!<br />
Sushi is cheap here. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to get any yet, but you can buy large trays (18 pcs) for $3-$6. And I don&#8217;t need to tell you how fresh it is. You can&#8217;t go through some parts of the city without seeing a sushi bar every minute or so.<br />
Then there&#8217;s some of the chain restaurants: Milestone&#8217;s (a kind of upscale bar/eatery that serves huge portions for next to nothing, and the food is always great), Earl&#8217;s (those of you in the west have heard of them, but for those of you in the east, I feel sorry that you can&#8217;t try them out!), and OSF (the Old Spaghetti Factory &#8212; yeah, I know there&#8217;s one in Toronto, but I still like the place).<br />
Anyway, enough on food&#8230; now I&#8217;m all hungry and I haven&#8217;t had breakfast yet!<br />
Well, I think I&#8217;m going to have to cut this short, because I have to start moving. (Not that it will take me a long time, but it&#8217;s still gotta be done.)<br />
More updates as events occur!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>We arrived late last night, no thanks to our most punctual airline. We made the mistake of taking a charter flight. What made it worse that the charter airline sub-contracted another charter airline to fly us to Vancouver. Air Transat isn&#8217;t exactly known for comfort. Royal Airlines ain&#8217;t exactly known &#8230; period.<br />
This was my first little apprehension. The plane was a Boeing 727-200. The chairs were so tightly packed that my knees were touching the seat in front of me. There was next to no room in the overhead compartments. It took nearly 45 minutes to get everyone on the plane. It was so tightly packed that a woman a couple of rows behind us had a panic attack and forced her way off the plane. I couldn&#8217;t blame her. As a direct result of her bailing out of the plane, the flight was delayed a further hour as they attempted to find her bag buried in the cargo hold. After over an hour and a half of waiting, we finally took to the air.<br />
Mental note to self: never fly anything except Canadian and Air Canada in the future. Canada 3000 as a last resort.<br />
On the plus side, we got free &#8220;sparkling wine&#8221; (a fancy way of saying that the wine they used wasn&#8217;t fit for peeling paint off walls), a reasonably decent meal (reconstituted chicked with unidentifiable green goop in the middle), and a pre-mixed salad that was not entirely unlike bad coleslaw. Real wine (someone&#8217;s joke of fermented grape juice) was available at that point. Liqueurs (brandy, schnapps, and some other harsh chemical) were served not longer after dinner. The guy sitting in the window seat kept talking to Allison, despite her heroic attempts to talk with me every chance she got &#8230; and took every chance to feel her up.<br />
The plane came to a rather rough bounce (kinda like when you skip stones across a pond) when we arrived. After walking most of the way across the Lower Mainland, we found our baggage carousel, and waited another 45 minutes for our lost luggage to be found. (For a while, we were wondering if the schmucks who took the luggage off in Toronto had forgotten to put it back on.)<br />
We didn&#8217;t get to Allison&#8217;s apartment until nearly 1:30am (Vancouver Time), where we promptly went to bed.<br />
This morning was rough. Ugly rough. The alarm went off at 7:30. We couldn&#8217;t pry ourselves out of bed until just after 8:00. I had a long list of things that I needed to do, and one of those things was an interview with Prologic Corporation (Allison&#8217;s company). It was time to play dress-up.<br />
We left the apartment just after 8:30. Allison dropped me off at a bus stop, so I could take a bus downtown. The ambient temperature was about 5-7 degrees, but the ambient humidity of about six trillion percent made it feel like two below zero.<br />
For the record: Vancouverites aren&#8217;t wimps. They may not be able to handle an Ontario winter, but I don&#8217;t think many Ontarioites can handle the kind of penetrating weather they have here.<br />
Upon arriving downtown, I made a valiant effort to contact the human resources manager at Prologic, to arrange the time for the interview (the time hadn&#8217;t been established by that point). The time was set for 2pm, so I had time to kill.<br />
I wandered down Davie St. trying to find the Vancouver Public Library. I needed to find a phone book (every single phone booth in Vancouver has had the phone book removed), so I could call the companies I had sent resumes to. Along the way, I found a McDonalds, and immediately called for breakfast.<br />
I began to notice the cold. I was wearing a dress-shirt, my sports jacket, and my slacks. I was cold. I decided that an overcoat wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad idea after all. Upon finding the Eaton&#8217;s store while trying to find the Library, I decided that a coat of some kind would be a good idea.<br />
That little task was repeated through most of the day. I don&#8217;t know what it is with people, particularly men&#8217;s fashions, but the cheapest raincoat I could find was $220. Hello?? Who buys a RAINCOAT for $220?? The most expensive one I found was over $1,000!! Who makes this stuff up?!<br />
Giving up on the raincoat issue for now (I had an umbrella for protection, and I wasn&#8217;t freezing to death), I found my way to the library. I checked up a couple of numbers, and decided that I should give myself a new challenge &#8212; find my way to Richmond, which is where Prologic has its offices.<br />
After polling a few bus drivers, I found the appropriate bus, and headed towards my interview. Allison had told me to get off the bus at Garden City and Cambie, where she would pick me up and bring me to Prologic. (The bus that ran from that corner to Prologic wasn&#8217;t exactly frequent.) I arrived at the corner about 45 minutes early, so I opted for lunch before calling Allison. Spying a 7-11 just down the road, I headed down to see what I could find.<br />
I walked into a small Italian pizzeria (which I would find out later was much more expensive than others in the area &#8212; I&#8217;m new to all this), and had a quick bite. Allison met me at the corner of Cambie and Garden City about a quarter to 2:00. She gave me a couple of quick pointers, and then sent me in to meet with destiny.<br />
While I waited for my first interviewer to appear, I quickly acquainted myself with some of Prologic&#8217;s literature on the desk &#8230; and the washroom. (Walking around in the penetrating chill had caused my bladder to swell somewhat.)<br />
When my first interview arrived, she took me to her office and started with the typical list of interview questions &#8230; except for the first: Why did you move to Vancouver?<br />
Then it was off to another building in the complex (Prologic has about 160 employees, and is growing at an unbelievable rate), usually referred to as &#8220;Second City&#8221;. (The third building is known as &#8220;Third Rock&#8221;.)<br />
There I was interviewed by the training manager, who wanted to know what kind of editing experience I had. Prologic needs an editor to work on some standards documents, and Allison thought I had the necessary anal retentiveness to make it work. (No comments from the peanut gallery!)<br />
I met with Allison after the interview, where she suggested I go to Oak Ridge Centre and wander around for a couple of hours before going back to her place. I would meet her at the entrance to Safeway so she could do some shopping. By the time she arrived, my feet were ready to abdicate from the rest of my body, and my shoulders had dropped two inches from carrying my laptop around all day.<br />
When we arrived back at her apartment, I made a hasty change, so we could go out to dinner. While we were getting ready the phone rang. It was Prologic calling to tell me they were willing to take me on. (It&#8217;s only a one-month contract, but considering I haven&#8217;t been here for 24 hours yet, I think it&#8217;s a good sign.) Following the call, we headed out for dinner.<br />
The restaurant of choice was &#8220;Naam&#8221;, a vegetarian (but thankfully, not vegan) restaurant in Kitsilano. Really good food, but it&#8217;s a little disconcerting to read a menu that has no meat on it whatsoever.<br />
And so my first day concludes on a decidedly upward note. There may be more long entries to following, depending on whether or not I want to write them.</p>

		<p>Dhar was up long before the rest of us. He took the time to wander around the neighbourhood, spooking my neighbours. Then he took the time to tell my father what mechanical difficulties we had. At around 09:00, Stefan, Rebecca, and I crawled out of the van and started to the mission of cleaning up the mess 10,000 kilometres had left.<br />
Our first problem was with our pressure sprayer &#8212; it was broken. This meant about an hour of strenuous scrubbing to try and get as many of the bug splats off as possible. We also plugged in the vacuum and went over every last scrap of carpet and fabric inside. The sink and burners were cleaned, any possessions removed, and Dhar&#8217;s car packed. By noon the mission was complete.<br />
Showers were not the order of the day, those came only after the van was washed. Even then Dhar opted to wait until he was home himself. Thus Dhar, Rebecca, and Stefan filed into Dhar&#8217;s Probe and vanished down the street. I immediately jumped in the shower. I was home.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960503.23</strong><br />
<em>Day 13</em><br />
It has finally ended. The Behemoth was washed this morning, Rebecca and Stef had showers (alone &#8211; a rarity in the last while), and then Dhar took them on their last leg home. I proceeded to get my pictures developed, and recant the trip to my family and friends.<br />
Tomorrow I must return to reality, something I&#8217;m not looking too forward to. But life must go on. Another road trip to P.E.I. may come up this summer, but that&#8217;ll be another story&#8230;
