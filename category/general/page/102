	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Long weekends are rarely long enough. I&#8217;d like one to last about a year, personally, but without all the seasonal changes. But I suppose that&#8217;s what Hawaii is for&#8230;<br />
My weekend (sort of) started on Thursday night, with the premiere of &#8220;Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones&#8221;. Although I&#8217;m still not sold on the title, I think the movie is a vast improvement over Episode One. And it&#8217;s gonna be a heck of a lead-in for Episode Three.<br />
One thing that was definitely missing this time was hype. True, hype can severely detriment a film. It can drag it down by setting expectations far too high. But at the same time, there&#8217;s such a powerful excitement that you really don&#8217;t care if the movie sucks or not &#8212; you just want to be there. While I can&#8217;t speak for either Therese or Stuart, I was a little disenchanted this time. Even when the words: &#8220;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&#8230;&#8221; came up, and the audience went ballistic (I love opening night crowds), I didn&#8217;t feel that excited grin cross my face. It was almost as if I was just seeing another movie.<br />
Maybe I was, but wasn&#8217;t willing to accept it. Who knows &#8212; a few people have speculated that this hasn&#8217;t exactly been the best year for me: My father passing away, my workload and responsibility load increasing dramatically, and now Chris having left for Japan. (And we&#8217;re not even half-way through the year yet.) I suppose it&#8217;s entirely possible that the joy I should feel last left. Is it time for a change in lifestyle, perhaps? Well, I&#8217;ve got one coming soon&#8230;<br />
The date of closure of my house is coming soon. In less than two weeks, I&#8217;ll be in my &#8220;new&#8221; house. I had originally feared that the excitement I first felt upon buying the house would eventually dissipate, and I wouldn&#8217;t end up wanting to move. Thankfully, the last few days have shown me that I am not only ready to leave my apartment, but I can&#8217;t wait to move into the house. Right now, I need the patience of a Jedi just to keep from bursting my skin wanting to move in. I&#8217;ve started driving by the house, just to remind myself. At times, this still feels like a dream. Whether or not it turns out to be a nightmare remains to be seen&#8230;<br />
On Friday night, I was supposed to attend Star Wars with friends from the office. However, I had other plans &#8212; seeing friends I haven&#8217;t seen for a very long time: Ed and Jen. Ed is one of my friends from first year university, and was one of my roommates during my second year. Both years rank very highly in my best and most cherished memories. It had been over four years since I&#8217;d last seen Jen &#8212; about one and a half since I&#8217;d last seen Ed &#8212; and in both cases it had been far too long.<br />
They arrived on the 9:45pm flight from Toronto, and despite looking a little dazed (and being quite hungry), they looked almost exactly the way I&#8217;d last remembered them. It&#8217;s good to know some things don&#8217;t change too much. We picked up their luggage, arranged for their rental car, and headed to my apartment. (Although I had sent them instructions on how to get there, I figured it was just plain easier for me to pick them up. Long flights and detailed instructions rarely mix well.)<br />
After unceremoniously dumping their belongings at the apartment, we adjourned to Ceili&#8217;s for a late evening meal (of chicken wings and seasoned chicken bites) and beer. It was also a chance to retell old stories, catch up on new ones, and retie the old bonds that had kept us friends. If anything, it reinforced the need for me to visit with friends this year, especially those I haven&#8217;t seen for a long time.<br />
We were in bed relatively early (I was plenty tired, and they were jet lagged), and up by 8:30. Ed and Jen were parked out on the street, which expired by 9:00 &#8212; besides, they wanted to get a start on the day and get on their camping vacation. The first order of business however, was breakfast. I knew of two places not too far away that were supposedly quite good, but only one I knew of for certain &#8212; The Galaxie Diner.<br />
This is probably about as landmark as a Calgary restaurant gets. And it has, according to my breakfast cohorts, some of the best breakfasts available. You just need to get there fairly early. Something I definitely need to keep in mind for the next time people are out this way.<br />
Following breakfast was a series of trips to get provisions and supplies for Ed and Jen. Luckily, they had upgraded their car reservation the night before from a Ford Focus to Pontiac Intrigue. (Yeah, I know, &#8220;upgrade&#8221; is subjective. Simple fact: the Intrigue is bigger. Hence, more room to store all the stuff they had.) By 2:30, they had all the things they needed, had seen a bit of Calgary, and were ready to head into the mountains.<br />
I spent the rest of the day watching TV and movies. I felt a complete lack of desire to go outside.<br />
Sunday morning, met up with Kaz for dim sum. She had called me a couple days earlier interested in going for dim sum, if there was a party going. I had some difficulty raising anyone else (turned out to be a case of missing people), so it ended up just being Kaz and myself.<br />
A first note on dim sum for two: Can&#8217;t be done, especially if you know what you&#8217;re getting and have been with large groups. Both Kaz and I overate. But it was all good &#8212; I didn&#8217;t eat again until much later.<br />
Going to dim sum with Kaz was a little uncomfortable. It was just me, so I lacked the &#8220;safety in numbers&#8221;. I know this sounds strange, but look at it this way: I was out with my best friend&#8217;s fiancée, while my best friend is half-way around the world. It&#8217;s a little disconcerting, and only because I&#8217;m still getting to know her, and she&#8217;s getting to know me. But by the end, I was feeling much better &#8212; I think it&#8217;s just a case of finding ground on my own. (Previously, Chris had always been around.) One thing the dim sum did give us was a chance to talk. There were a few things Kaz needed to know, not only about Chris, but about the rest of us, too. Barring a change in plans, Kaz will become Chris&#8217; wife, and therefore someone who&#8217;ll need to know who we are.<br />
After dim sum, I wandered about downtown for a while, but ended up at home. Watching TV. And movies.<br />
Luckily, I was rescued by Stuart and Therese, who invited me over for the first barbecue of the season, and to watch the final episode of the X-Files. The three of us (and often with Chris) had watched the X-Files religiously for years &#8212; often in our parents&#8217; basements when were in Oakville, with my travelling to Guelph a few times to watch season premieres (and finales) when we were in university, and sharing stories and theories during the summer breaks. But no more, except in reruns.<br />
Today was &#8230; pretty much a nothing day. I needed to come in to work, but couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it. I forced myself outside for a couple of hours, but soon found myself wanting to go home again. It was a warm day, but hazy &#8230; the Weather Network put it down as &#8220;smoke&#8221;, but from what I don&#8217;t know &#8212; the mountains are still thawing out.<br />
Another week is underway, and it brings me another week closer to changing my life. I, for one, can&#8217;t wait.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Maybe this is forever,<br />
Forever fades away,<br />
Like a rocket ascending into space,<br />
Could you not be sad,<br />
Could you not break down,<br />
After all I won&#8217;t let go,<br />
Until you&#8217;re safe and sound.<br />
&#8212; &#8220;Safe and Sound&#8221;, Sheryl Crow</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, a dream came true. Today, Chris left on his jet plane; destination: Narita International Airport, Japan. For the next 365 days, he&#8217;ll live in a different country, a different culture, and experience something that many of us never will.<br />
Last Thursday (9 May 2002) was Chris&#8217; first attempt. This was a bit of a false start, which we could only owe to a fair amount of miscommunication.<br />
Chris, Kaz, and I arrived at the airport just after 9:30 that morning, and wheeled Chris&#8217; copious amount of heavy luggage to the check-in counter. The clerk took Chris&#8217; ticket, and started the process to get him all set to go. However, part-way through checking him in, she noted something odd. Chris only had a one-way ticket. This prompted the following discussion:<br />
Clerk: Going to Japan?<br />
Chris: (Excitedly) Yes.<br />
Clerk: Are you going to work in Japan?<br />
Chris: Yes, I&#8217;m going to teach English.<br />
Clerk: Where&#8217;s your visa?<br />
At this point, my heart sank. I think Chris&#8217; started to, but he quickly started telling the clerk about the arrangement he had with the company. As far as Chris understood it, there was a visa with his name on it, just waiting for him in Japan. However, as the clerk knew it, Chris would not be allowed into Japan without a visa, and without a round-trip ticket he would be viewed as an immigrant, rather than a tourist. Without a work visa, Chris would be denied entry &#8230; and Air Canada would be fined $10,000 for sending someone without proper papers.<br />
Chris started making (somewhat frantic) phone calls to the Canadian branch of his company, based in Montreal. I&#8217;ve known Chris for half my life. But I have never seen him look as despondent as he did when the truth slowly started to form. It was becoming quite clear that Chris would not be going to Japan that day.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where I was really impressed. Air Canada is notorious for being the worst airline in Canada when it comes to service. Well, not only did the clerk retrieve Chris&#8217; bags (she had sent two down before realizing that there was going to be trouble), but she also managed to convert Chris&#8217; non-changeable/non-refundable ticket into a changeable ticket, where the issuing agent would &#8220;refund&#8221; the price and immediately roll it over into a round-trip open ticket.<br />
Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s *supposed* to happen: Chris is to travel to Japan with an open ticket. He can enter the country as a tourist for 90 days on a &#8220;tourist visa&#8221;. (Doesn&#8217;t actually exist, but that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s referred to as.) Once he&#8217;s in the door, he can convert his &#8220;tourist visa&#8221; into a work visa. This is the way his company operates, mostly because they get teachers on short notice, and don&#8217;t have three months to wait to clear visas from the originating country.<br />
So Chris got to spend nearly an extra week in Calgary, with his fiancée, and with his friends. After he got his new ticket, it suddenly seemed more real than it had the first time. It was almost like I knew that he wouldn&#8217;t actually leave the first time &#8212; that something would keep him here. Today, it was real. Today, I knew I would see him walk through security, and not come back.<br />
Chris, Kaz, and I arrived at the airport shortly after 9:00 (his flight to Vancouver left a half-hour earlier than the previous one). This time, checking Chris in took about 15 minutes &#8212; less than three of which were at the counter. Boarding pass in hand, all we had to do was wait.<br />
Just after 10:00, we proceeded to the gate to show Chris off. It was just the three of us. I had always imagined this giant throng of friends who would be wishing him off, causing a massive traffic jam of people. But it was just us. I think I actually preferred it that way.<br />
It was a lot easier seeing Chris off than I thought it would be. It&#8217;s probably because Chris and I know each other so well now that it really doesn&#8217;t matter where we are &#8212; halfway around the world is a short distance for people so close to each other.<br />
Chris and Kaz, on the other hand, weren&#8217;t quite as easy. I can&#8217;t blame them &#8212; deeply in love, recently engaged, and the single largest test of distance just beginning. But they&#8217;ll have others for support, and the knowledge that Chris will be coming back.<br />
I suppose the whole thing hasn&#8217;t fully hit me yet, though. I&#8217;m going to go home to what&#8217;s now just my apartment. No roommate. (Not counting the cat, that is.) No-one to talk to. No-one to laugh with. No-one to watch bad movies and rhyme off childish one-liners with.<br />
A little over two years to the day that Chris arrived here, Chris left. The day he arrived, I felt an intense anger that I was cohabitating again (I hadn&#8217;t gotten over the ex-girlfriend issues at the time). Now I can&#8217;t imagine not living with him. But I know that while he may be gone, he&#8217;s still there. And he always will be.<br />
God speed, dear friend.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ever tried to catch a thrown brick? It ain&#8217;t easy. First, you prepare for the heavy weight, which often has sharp edges, and then you try to position your body so that you can buffer the shock and try to prevent bodily harm. But in almost every case, you end up dropping it because it&#8217;s a lot heavier than you think it is.<br />
Such is what happened to me last evening. It started innoculously enough &#8212; a simple phone call from Chris. Well, &#8220;simple&#8221; in its simplest meaning, but loaded with a lot of &#8220;something big&#8221;. It went like this:<br />
Me: Hello?<br />
Chris: Hey man, what&#8217;s up? (Standard opening to a phone call for us.)<br />
Me: Not much, the usual hell of my daily life. (Standard answer to the question.)<br />
Chris: You doing anything tonight?<br />
Me: Nope. (Knowing full well that I was supposed to meet with an insurance agent, who never ended up showing.)<br />
Chris: Great! Kaz and I would like to meet you for coffee.<br />
That&#8217;s when my &#8220;Danger Will Robinson! Danger!&#8221; alarm went off. Chris has never, EVER, asked me to go for &#8220;coffee&#8221;. And if he would ask, the question would be posed as follows: &#8220;Wanna grab a coffee after work?&#8221; or something similar. The question was too formal, and loaded with the &#8220;Kaz and I&#8221;. Immediate thoughts ran through my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kaz is pregnant.</li>
<li>Chris has decided not to go to Japan, and is moving in with Kaz.</li>
<li>Chris and Kaz got engaged.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m overreacting, and it&#8217;s nothing.</li>
<li>Kaz is going to Japan with Chris. (She&#8217;s Japanese by birth, so it&#8217;s not *that* big of a stretch.)</li>
<li>After I move to my new house, Chris is hoping I might take Kaz in as a roommate.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve eloped and are married, bought a house, and Kaz is pregnant with twins. (Like with all things I do, even my paranoia follows the adage: Go big, or go home.)</li>
</ol>
<p>These flitted through pretty quickly, and none stuck. I figured it was just Chris being a little strange because of having a new girlfriend (Chris sometimes gets like that).<br />
That evening, I ducked out shortly before 6pm and headed home. I was hoping to meet up with the building manager to try and swing a May 31st departure. But the manager I needed to talk to wasn&#8217;t in. I instead went up to the apartment for a few minutes before heading out to meet up with Chris and Kaz at the Starbuck&#8217;s on 17th Ave. (which was where I was supposed to meet the absent agent) for 7pm.<br />
Although I didn&#8217;t notice it at the time, Chris was a little &#8230; nervous. And for good reason. We took up a seat next to the fireplace, and almost immediately Chris and Kaz held out their left hands. On their ring fingers were matching (but differently sized) plain white gold rings.<br />
Number three.<br />
There are few things that will shock me. There are few things that will surprise me. There are even fewer things that will stun me so completely that for about a minute I can&#8217;t think of anything to say. I finally had to force out &#8220;My most sincere congratulations&#8221; and stifle the &#8220;Are you out of your collective minds?!&#8221;.<br />
Once we&#8217;d gotten by the uncomfortable silence that followed the &#8220;announcement&#8221; (it took a little while for it to sink in), I had to start asking questions. As one of Chris&#8217; friends, one of my responsibilities is to be his conscience, whether he likes it or not. The trick is not to ask questions that could be construed as insulting. Chris knows me well &#8212; I can ask him literally anything and he&#8217;ll understand it&#8217;s just me checking my own sanity as much as his. Kaz, on the other hand, is only just getting to know me. Having caught the dropped bomb, I now had to be careful about laying the landmines.<br />
A lot of people would sit back and suggest that they&#8217;re moving too quickly (which is a perfectly valid thought), that they haven&#8217;t thought things through, that this is inherently risky (especially since Chris is going to Japan for a year), and there is no way they could possibly know each other well enough.<br />
Any question you ask, they&#8217;ve thought of. They&#8217;ve considered it. There is no fear, no doubt, no hesitation. And above all, there is sensible thought about all of it. That was one of the first things I checked. Having been engaged in the past, I know what kind of pressures they&#8217;ll be under, and having popped the question so soon after meeting each other (about three weeks, by my count), they&#8217;ll be under way more pressure than most.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m totally happy for them. I think it&#8217;s great that they were able to find each other, and able to realize very early in the relationship that this wasn&#8217;t just some iffy thing &#8212; they could see it in themselves that they were ready to be with each other for the rest of their lives. I will be lucky if I have that happen to me. I&#8217;ve seen it a couple of times before, but I guess with my own history, I&#8217;m not too optimistic for myself.<br />
So as if my anxieties about losing Chris weren&#8217;t bad enough, now he&#8217;s getting married (no plans beyond coming back from Japan, sorry). That means more isolation for myself, and the inevitable sound of little feet (though hopefully, no time soon).<br />
I&#8217;m too young for this shit.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Although it&#8217;s very tempting to say that it&#8217;s the beginning of the end &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t really be appropriate.<br />
It&#8217;s no longer a guess, it&#8217;s not a possibility, it&#8217;s not even a plan anymore. It&#8217;s fact. Chris is going to Japan. On Thursday (9 May 2002). For an entire year, he&#8217;ll be teaching children of all ages the fine art of writing, reading, and speaking English.<br />
Be afraid. Be very afraid.<br />
Friday marked Chris&#8217; last day at Critical Mass. It was an emotional day for many people, including myself. Although it does sound a little strange that Chris and I not only work together but live together, you do need to understand that it works very well for us. We don&#8217;t see each other much around the office (we&#8217;re on different floors, different projects, and more times than not, all we get to do is nod at each other), so a lot of the time we see each other is at home, or when we&#8217;re out with friends.<br />
I&#8217;ve known Chris a very long time &#8212; now over half of my life. (I&#8217;ve known Stuart just as long, and Therese not too far off.) I&#8217;ve lived with him for two years. (In fact, Chris will be leaving just a couple days shy of his two-year anniversary in Calgary.) It&#8217;s going to be hard to not have him around.<br />
To mark his departure, we wanted to do something special. We wanted to give him something that he&#8217;d not only remember us (and I&#8217;m not referring to just Therese, Stuart, and myself &#8212; I&#8217;m referring to almost everyone he knows in Calgary), but something he&#8217;d use. Knowing that Chris will be completely overwhelmed by everything he&#8217;ll see and do while he&#8217;s in Japan, I figured the best thing was to give him a digital camera. I threw the idea out to the ABC &#8212; the &#8220;Asian Brother Crew&#8221;, who pretty much all agreed that it was the best thing going.<br />
There were two tacks that we could take &#8212; get him a cheap camera and have a small number of people, or get a good one and include a larger number of folks. Teak and I discussed this at length and decided to &#8220;go big, or go home&#8221;. (Or as my dad would say: If you&#8217;re going to do something, do it right.) So Teak gathered a small flock of people and  raised a small fortune. Although I was prepared to put in the lion&#8217;s share of the cost, I didn&#8217;t have to in the end.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t Chris&#8217; only gift from friends. Jensenne and Jeanette, with photos and blurbs from friends, made Chris a scrapbook to remember what he was leaving behind. It was a great combination of fun, goofiness, old pictures, silly pictures, and a lot of people who wanted Chris to not stay away.<br />
As for the last hurrah, we all agreed that Sakana Grill was the place. Teak made the arrangements &#8212; actually talking to the manager (it&#8217;s a lot easier to have a guy who can speak Japanese to make a reservation at a Japanese restaurant), and reserving enough places for 50+ people. This wasn&#8217;t all just for Chris, though &#8212; this was also for Nathan (in our AppDev department) and Jen (who had been filling in as our receptionist), who were also celebrating their last day at Critical Mass.<br />
We had 43 confirmations on Friday morning. There were at least 60 people when Chris, Tamara, Stuart, and myself arrived.  (Stuart is not Therese&#8217;s Stuart &#8212; this is a new co-worker who&#8217;s trying to get to know people.) We had a hard time sitting in. But we weren&#8217;t the last. We actually overflowed the area we were sitting. It was crazy.<br />
After dinner, the immense crowd broke up, and we ended up with the ABC, plus a couple of others. Plans were loosely set, mostly that Chris had to go pick up Kaz. It was decided that the bulk of the group would go to Cinescape to play video games, and we&#8217;d give them a call when we were more organized.<br />
Who&#8217;s Kaz, you ask?<br />
Kaz is short for Kazumi &#8230; and is Chris&#8217; new girlfriend.<br />
Yeah, he has a girlfriend. It&#8217;s kinda creepy how well they get along, especially considering at the time the two of them hooked up, Chris already knew he was going to Japan. (Kaz, by the way, is Japanese, and has only been in Canada for about a year.) She knew he was going to Japan. But they&#8217;re both serious about each other, to the point where they&#8217;re waiting on each other until Chris gets back a year from now.<br />
We picked Kaz up from the Petro-Canada on 4th St. (she had just come off work) and dropped her off at home. We returned to our apartment where Chris got cleaned up, I tidied the apartment, and then starting calling around to see what people were interested in. The plan ended up with everyone coming over to our apartment for video games and movies. Not particularly original, but still fun.<br />
It would be the last game/movie night in our apartment.<br />
Chris went off to retrieve Kaz as everyone started to arrive. Pretty soon, the living room was full of people yelling and screaming (due to invigorating games of Virtua Tennis). We switched to a movie a little later on, &#8220;Shaolin Soccer&#8221;, which several people hadn&#8217;t seen.<br />
The last game night ended around 2am, with everyone heading to their respective homes. Unfortunately, Chris and Kaz didn&#8217;t get back until everyone was leaving, and missed out on the festivities.<br />
Yesterday, we planned to have the whole crew go down to Chinook Paramount to watch Spider-Man, for a last group night at the movies. I tried to organize this within the span of about 20 minutes, with some degree of success, but in the end (owing to scheduling and communication problems), Chris was unable to come (he has promised to pick up Kaz after work, which conflicted with the movie time). We did luckily end up meeting for tea/coffee/dessert at Bubblemania on 16th Ave.<br />
This morning was one of the big &#8220;lasts&#8221; &#8212; the last dim sum. This was when it finally hit me. The other lasts hadn&#8217;t done anything, but this one left me really thinking about what was going to happen. Although Chris does intend to return in a year (because of Kaz), there will always be the possibility that he may never return from Japan. I had to give a moment of pause when I realized that there was the chance that this is another chapter of my life about to close.<br />
The next few days are going to be odd. They are going to be hard.<br />
But not as hard as the ones that will follow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s official, Mother Nature is bipolar.<br />
North America has been receiving some very erratic weather as of late. Out here, it&#8217;s been a little more consistent than erratic &#8230; consistently bad, that is.<br />
So far this year, we&#8217;ve had about two warm days. Luckily, both on weekends. But here we are, a month into spring, and I&#8217;m still hauling out my winter jacket. Two months ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have cared about that. Those of you who know me reasonably well know that I rather like winter. I like snow. I even like the mind-numbing cold &#8230; for short periods of time, anyway.<br />
But this weather truly sucks.<br />
Take yesterday, for example. I was waiting around for an insurance agent to call. (I&#8217;m looking around for quotes on mortgage insurance, as well as new house insurance. Although this particular agent is more of a favour for a friend, so I don&#8217;t know if it will go anywhere at all.) I was fiddling around with one of my own personal websites when my phone rang. It was Joanne (the agent). She asked me why I was still at work. I asked if we were still meeting (yeah, I know, you should never answer a question with a question, but it was a lead-in for an answer I never got to give). She said it was snowing.<br />
I looked out the window. Overcast, yes. Snow, no.<br />
Snowing? I asked. Yep &#8212; lots of it in the South East. I work in the South East. (Well, barely, anyway.) But there was no snow that I could see. But apparently the weather was getting really miserable. Joanne suggested we hold off until next week. (It was better for her, anyway.) I agreed, and figured I should head out &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t brought a winter jacket, and it sounded like it was going to get really cold.<br />
I took the C-Train &#8212; the wind was just chilly enough to make walking uncomfortable in the jacket I had. In hindsight, it was the best thing I could have done. No more than five minutes after I&#8217;d returned to my apartment did I happen to notice something. I couldn&#8217;t see buildings a block away. It was snowing. Hard. We were having a blizzard.<br />
It&#8217;s Spring. Or at least it&#8217;s supposed to be Spring. But this weather would make you really wonder what month it is. Were it not for the fact that it gets dark much later in the evening, you&#8217;d almost swear it was December. And even if the groundhog did see his shadow, we should be well in the clear by now.<br />
Spring never sprung here &#8212; it&#8217;s still frozen stuck.<br />
This is going to be a bit of an odd year for weather, I think. I&#8217;m not sure if this is an effect of El Nino (supposedly back on the rise again) or of global warming (which really isn&#8217;t proving itself out here). We&#8217;re probably going to see a cooler west, a hotter and more humid south (we should probably expect a Class 5 hurricane), and probably a few more violent weather shifts across the continent. Heck, we might even see a tornado around Cowtown.<br />
So if you see good weather this year, get out in it while you can. If you blink, you might miss it&#8230;</p>

		<p>There are times when I hate owning a car.<br />
My car&#8217;s been having problems this winter. We had a really cold one &#8212; from late December through to just a week or so ago, we were having some really nasty cold snaps. Seeing -20 on the thermometer became a regular occurrance. Seeing -30 was far more frequent than we would have liked, one we had the fortune of repeating a several times.<br />
My car has been through cold weather before &#8212; Waterloo and Ottawa for a couple of winters, during one of which I had trouble starting the engine (the injectors froze, I think). But I&#8217;d never really thought too much about getting a block heater to aid starting the engine when it was cold. Normally it wasn&#8217;t an issue, and if the engine was left to warm up a bit, ran just fine.<br />
This winter brought my lack of a block heater to a head, though. Except that I didn&#8217;t get one installed. I hesitated, procrastinated, forgot, and avoided all winter. Why? Simple &#8212; Chris and I don&#8217;t drive very much. And when we do, it&#8217;s almost as likely to get a ride from our friends than it is for us to drive. Also, living in Calgary means that you also get chinooks, which is coincidentally when we managed to get the car started.<br />
But not the week I had to go home to Oakville for my father&#8217;s funeral. (Uh&#8230; I just realized that some of you don&#8217;t know this &#8212; I haven&#8217;t sent a log entry about it. [[Death of David Charles Sowrey|My father passed away on March 7th]], after fighting off various cancers for the past year. Needless to say, it&#8217;s been a tough year for my family.)<br />
Anyway, that week in Calgary was cold, and regularly in the low negative 20s. Chris tried to start my car a couple of times, for a variety of reasons/needs, but was unable as the engine was too cold. The battery wasn&#8217;t strong enough to power the starter to get the engine to turn over. So the car just sat in the garage, and waited for our return.<br />
Yes, I was kicking myself for not getting a block heater. The last month was quite cold, and the car never started once. The battery finally dropped to the point where starting the engine, even if it was hot, was an impossibility. This necessitated a jump from someone, so I could get the car somewhere.<br />
This really became a problem though, because I haven&#8217;t exactly been the most organized person in the last little while. (For obvious reasons I need not elaborate on.) Luckily for me, there was a solution: the AMA. No, not the American Medical Association &#8212; the Alberta Motor Association. The local incarnation of CAA. Little beknownst to me, I&#8217;ve had a CAA membership for several years now &#8230; courtesy of my mother, who had not only myself, but also my sister tacked onto her membership.<br />
The things you learn at Easter dinner.<br />
Armed with the number, I finally decided on Saturday to give the AMA a buzz and get my car up and running again. After an hour wait (the AMA is overworked in this city), a Battery Assist (AMA&#8217;s jump service) truck showed up at my apartment. It was a (relatively) warm day &#8212; peeking above zero for the first time in weeks. It was a perfect day to spend more money to fix my car again.<br />
The first big hurdle was just getting the truck to my car. The Battery Assist truck is a heavy-duty 1/2 ton, which sits high as a result of its undercarriage. The service guy (whose name escapes me, unfortunately) drove hanging onto the steering wheel while hanging out the door, making sure his roof didn&#8217;t get caught on the concrete ceiling. (Apparently, his partner got stuck in a parking garage the week before, and had to let the air out of his tires to get the truck out.)<br />
He barely made it onto Level 3.<br />
We popped the hood on my car, and he slapped on his testing gizmo to check my battery. It&#8217;s a little more advanced than my AA battery tester. Among several functions, it can also tell what the Cold Cranking Amps are. (This, apparently, is a measure of how well your battery can start an engine.) My battery read 62. You need a minimum of 160, or something like that. In short, a jump would only get me going. The battery, for all intents and purposes, was dead.<br />
Ironically enough, this was what I had planned to do anyway &#8212; replace the battery. I&#8217;d figured it was past its due date, and was high time to get a new one. The news from the AMA guy just reinforced that a bit. I muttered a bit about how this probably wouldn&#8217;t have been such a big deal if I&#8217;d bucked down and got the block heater. The AMA guy agreed, suggesting that it should be something I might want to look into for next winter.<br />
I was offered the opportunity to get my battery replaced by the AMA. For the same price of a Canadian Tire battery, but without the mandatory installation and testing fees that they charge to warranty the battery. I suppose I could have gone to Costco, but if I&#8217;d shut the engine off, I&#8217;d need another jump to move the car again. And considering I&#8217;d get roadside assistance if anything happened, this just seemed like a good deal.<br />
The tech got to work, whipping out his tools and preparing to change my battery. Wonder why he drove a heavy-duty half-ton truck? The back&#8217;s full of batteries, old and new. (He never needs to worry about traction in the winter, that&#8217;s for sure!)<br />
I think the battery was original, or at the very least hadn&#8217;t been changed since I got the car. Either way, it wasn&#8217;t easy to remove it. The battery cables were stiff and the nuts didn&#8217;t loosen easily, the bolt that held the battery in place was almost rusted shut and was very difficult to move, and the block heater cord kept getting in the way&#8230;<br />
&#8230;block heater cord? What block heater cord?<br />
Much to my surprise, delight, and utter dismay, the tech held out a cord that looked suspiciously like it was attached to a block heater. He followed it down until it disappeared into the engine block. There&#8217;s only one thing I know of that comes out of an engine block that requires a standard three-prong cord.<br />
All you can do at a time like that is laugh. Which is good, because if you can&#8217;t laugh at yourself, then you don&#8217;t have license to laugh at anyone else.<br />
The battery swapped, tested, and warrantied, I proceeded to go for a drive an ensure all was well. So far, the car&#8217;s running better. I guess the cost was worth it &#8212; my transportation actually transports again. I even got it cleaned to get the last couple of month&#8217;s dirt and dust off (it collects very easily in our parking garage). Of course, it started snowing again that evening.<br />
I hope it really warms up soon. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll have to plug in the block heater.</p>

		<p>Third year running: Lots of family, lots of activity, and way too much food.<br />
This year&#8217;s events started Thursday evening, when my mother arrived from Ontario, as did Chris&#8217; parents for their first (and possibly only) visit with Chris in Calgary.<br />
(A side note on that: Chris is still planning to go to Japan. The question is when. At this point, he&#8217;s still in the interview process with the company, who has suggested that they are sending four people in April. Yes, it&#8217;s now April, and we have no idea what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;m pretty sure that this is inevitable, it&#8217;s just when the ball finally gets rolling.)<br />
So, back to family.<br />
I didn&#8217;t see my mother, Nana, or the Mays until the following day. (I went to an antique show at the Roundup Centre, looking for a dining room table. Without success, I might add.) Friday morning, I stumbled from bed to find Mr. and Mrs. May watching TV. They and Chris had plans (I&#8217;m not sure what), as did I &#8212; I was to go out with my family for an excursion to beautiful Cochrane.<br />
For those of you who know Cochrane, you may now laugh at the joke. For those of you who haven&#8217;t, consider yourself lucky.<br />
Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t be that harsh &#8212; Cochrane isn&#8217;t that bad. If you know what you want, it&#8217;s quite pleasant. But the weather wasn&#8217;t quite cooperative, and the wait for lunch (although tasty), was a little too long for some of us.<br />
After lunch, we wandered about the &#8220;main drag&#8221; (about three blocks) for a little while, perusing the various wares in the touristy stores, before deciding it was high time to get the heck outta Dodge.<br />
That brought us to, quite logically, Bragg Creek. We didn&#8217;t stay there too long, either, about long enough to pick up some candles for Nana, and for Jen to fall asleep in the rear of the van. Mike joined her there on our way back to Calgary. That night, we had dinner at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s.<br />
Saturday was the great party. This was the family get together that has now become a tradition &#8212; this is the third year running (for me, anyway). My day started off rather by searching for antiques in Inglewood (specifically, the aforementioned table). This was a rather futile effort, unfortunately &#8212; Inglewood has become so trendy that most of the antique stores cater to the trendy types, and don&#8217;t carry the kinds of things I was looking for. Or, if they do, are far overpriced and the storekeeps are rather anal about people touching the things they want to buy.<br />
On my way back, I stopped into the Cellar (a wine shop downtown) to pick up beverages for the evening&#8217;s repast. All I knew was the main course: salmon wrapped in phyllo pastry. But that was enough for the staff to help me purchase a rather large quantity of wines. I hoped it would support the large number of guests.<br />
Now, you&#8217;re probably wondering what the deal is with the salmon. Last year (see [[Easter with my family, friends]]), we overdid ourselves at Bodega. After learning of the damage inflicted on Ryan&#8217;s credit card (some of us were not given the opportunity to pitch in), the decision was made to tone it down a bit, and have the meal at Pam&#8217;s house, and hire in a caterer. Luckily, Aunt Brenda knows of one through her guiding efforts.<br />
Now Darryl (which I believe is his name) isn&#8217;t some hoity-toity kind of chef. He&#8217;s a down-to-earth chef who believes in talking with the people who are going to eat his meals. And he doesn&#8217;t mind and endless set of questions about how he made his food. Mostly because it was really good.<br />
Of note in particular was the salmon. He took (rather large) portions of salmon, wrapped them in phyllo pastry with onions, carrots, and a bit of dill, and baked it in the oven until the pastry was nicely browned. In my life, so far anyway, I&#8217;ve had three outstanding salmon dishes: The Pacific Starlight in 1998 (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]), the Royal Hudson in 1999 (see [[BC Rail Royal Hudson 2860, West Coast Railway Association, Comox Airshow, and Skyhawks]]), and this salmon dish at Pam&#8217;s house. I had to go back for seconds. (Which, luckily for me, I could.)<br />
Suffice to say, I overate.<br />
The following dinner wasn&#8217;t much better. This time, Chris, his parents, and I traipsed up to the northeast, to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home. There, again, we gorged ourselves on whatever we could get our hands on. In this case, it was turkey, one of my favourite meals. And as before, I ate far too much. I would have eaten more were it not for one itty bitty little thing:<br />
We were having a blizzard.<br />
Calgary&#8217;s weather is strange. Chris swears that the next forecast will be for locusts. (We&#8217;ve had almost everything else except the waters turning to blood.) It was into the low teens yesterday around noon, was approaching zero when we left for my relative&#8217;s, was snowing by the time we got off the train, and was full-force blizzard by 8:00pm.<br />
I love this city.<br />
Easter (and the dinners to end all dinners) finally ends tonight: A meal at Silver Dragon, where Chris&#8217; parents get the unenviable pleasure of meeting all of Chris&#8217; friends. (After this, they won&#8217;t want to come back to Calgary again.)<br />
Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to waddle home afterwards.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The following was the eulogy read out at my father&#8217;s funeral. It was written by one of our closest family friends, Mrs. Claudette Robinson, who also did the reading.</p>
<blockquote><p>David was a multi-talented man.  What was his calling?  Hmmm&#8230;let me see now&#8230;<br />
Well, David was a salesman, a carpenter, or more precisely a cabinet-maker, a handyman, a poet, an architect, an engineer, an electrician, an auto mechanic, a painter, a plumber, a gardener, a boater, a traveler, a cook, a conversationalist, a connoisseur of impeccable scotch, (although he was fond of saying, how he had long ago given up on quality &#8230;it was quantity that mattered now&#8230;) an animal lover, a lover of classical music, and as we all know&#8230;an incredible host and a friend to all of us here and oh my&#8230; if you were a friend in need&#8230;was he ever a friend in deed! I would like to expand against this background.<br />
<strong>David the Salesman:</strong><br />
When it came to heavy equipment David was a superb salesman. Not only did he sell equipment, he followed up on all his sales to make sure the equipment was functioning properly and those of us that knew his love of heavy machinery always suspected that he was also making sure that his beloved machines were properly maintained with 15W40 and not abused in any way. David practically adopted all his customers and became indispensable to them. I was just driving by he would say to his customers and thought I would drop in and &#8230; by the way&#8230;when was the last time you changed the oil on that sucker uh?<br />
<strong>David the Cabinet Maker:</strong><br />
The Sowrey&#8217;s residence is material proof of David&#8217;s prowess as a carpenter&#8230; witness the kitchen cupboards, the bay windows, the oak floors, the oak railing, the deck, the wine rack, the greenhouse, the stairs, the new washroom, the built in furniture in Geoff and Cathy&#8217;s room, the kitchen table, the tile countertops the made to measure bar drawer with special heavy duty sliders&#8230;to name but a few. The sauna has remained to this day, an unfinished project something unusual for David. I personally suspect that after a few years of waiting for its completion Linda finally decided to store all her files in this space and this, in my mind, prompted David to decide (and you will have to excuse me here for wanting to quote him precisely) To Fuck the sauna!<br />
David was a perfectionist who paid great attention to details and showed incredible patience when working on a project. He did not enjoy working alone and his most faithful gopher a.k.a. Linda was always there to fetch a tool for him or as she would say: in case he needs another pair of hands. Time meant nothing to David when he started on something nor did lunch hour and I must admit that occasionally Linda was seen rolling her eyes and shaking her head (she was probably starving!) to which David&#8217;s typical response would be: Now Linda&#8230;don&#8217;t get your tit in the wringer!<br />
This expression that he loved to use was always accepted with a grin except the one time that David (perhaps under the influence, but I &#8216;m not sure of that&#8230;) made and error in judgment and used it on his very proper Scottish mother Bea&#8230;<br />
Oh my!  If looks could kill we would have lost David on that very day many years ago.<br />
<strong>David the Electrician:</strong><br />
Electricity fascinated David and he could wire anything! Pot lights, spotlights, central vacuums, stoves, appliances, speakers, anything in fact under 1200 volts. Some of his less capable friends, jealous no doubt of his multi skills, actually blamed his mid winter tan (noticed on his hands and face only) to a jolting experience. This by the way has never been confirmed and I personally find it shocking (if you will excuse the pun) that someone would even think of this&#8230;sheeesh&#8230;his hair never even sprung curls &#8230;to my knowledge (as David would say).<br />
<strong>David the Painter:</strong><br />
David could paint anything and wallpaper anything as well. That was the easy part, what he did in preparation however was something else and being his helper required the patience of Job, those walls were so clean &#8230;thank you TSP that it hardly seemed necessary to paint them when he was through with the preparation. He did the cutting out&#8230;the rolling, and the cleaning of all equipment afterwards. I did notice though that when putting up wallpaper, the plumb lines were not as straight at the end of the day as they had been at the beginning&#8230;. Hmmm I am not a hundred percent sure (as David would say) what to attribute that too.<br />
<strong>David the Poet:</strong><br />
It seems to me that David was one of those rare persons whose both sides of the brain worked equally well. Not only was David brilliant at math and figures and conversions but he was also very artistic (a trait he undoubtedly inherited from his dad). If the mood struck him, David could whip up a poem at a moment&#8217;s notice witness his earlier Xmas letters and he could pen a fine letter &#8220;to boot&#8221; as he would say and did I mention his calligraphy skills? And so on and so forth&#8230;again as David was fond of saying&#8230;<br />
<strong>David the Gardener:</strong><br />
David embraced gardening with his usual enthusiasm and the green house, first ours, and then theirs, opened a new world to him. He had the patience, not to mention the moral fortitude to plant with the help of tweezers over a million individual seeds every year. This whole process began in January and continued until the 24th of May weekend. This period, by the way, was noted as being very beneficial to LCBO stores and to DuMaurier stockholders as David spent an incredible amount of time nurturing his plants and watching them grow as he sipped his scotch and enjoyed a smoke.<br />
<strong>David the Car Lover:</strong><br />
The Wheel&#8217;s section of the Star was David&#8217;s favourite reading of the week and with his incredible memory he would, over a few drinks of scotch or a beer,or a cognac relate to Don all the new things happening in the car industry. He loved cars and owned so many of them over the years that when I inquired from his family for a list of his cars (my guestimate is that he had over 20 of them in his lifetime) they told me it would be easier rather than to list them to just mention that he never owned a Volvo &#8230;He looked after his car as a treasured and valued possession a quality he passed on to Geoff and Cathy when they became car owners&#8230;You change your oil every 6 months or 5000 kilometers and only use 15W40&#8230;That&#8217;s what they use in back hoes and they work so warm it up for 20 minutes in the winter&#8230; For Christ sake!<br />
[Ed. Note: Actually, Dad *did* own a Volvo. If that&#8217;s not an indication of how many cars he owned, I don&#8217;t know what is.]<br />
David not only loved cars but also loved driving and his favourite retirement plan was to travel to a warmer southern location and find an RV park. When I inquired as to what he did once he got there he responded: Oh&#8230; just shoot the shit with the old farts&#8230;<br />
<strong>David the Boater:</strong><br />
David was in his element on the water. He loved it! He loved boating and owned two large boats, namely Mamicat and Calvados. With his usual generous invitations to friends to come on board and have a few, he once again maintained a buoyant economy for Canada all through his boat ownership years.<br />
<strong>David the Animal Lover:</strong><br />
David had a soft spot in his heart for all animals and in his lifetime he owned 3 pussy cats, 4 dogs and for the last few years a granddog: Bear. He gave them treats, brushed them, washed them and talked to them, loved them and disciplined them: No Puss Puss, you can&#8217;t have your dinner! It&#8217;s not 4:30 yet! This discipline however was not applied to friends when they dropped by in the morning. David would in his usual inviting way say: Sit down dammit and have a drink! But it&#8217;s only 10 o&#8217;clock David&#8230;Well it&#8217;s past noon in Newfoundland! Now do you want Rimmer or not?<br />
<strong>David the Conversationalist:</strong><br />
David could talk to anybody on any subject especially from an historical viewpoint. His most animated conversations were on politics and politicians most of whom he had limited regard for&#8230; He was fond of saying: They couldn&#8217;t organize a pissup in a brewery for Christ sake!<br />
David had a colorful way with language and if you will indulge me for a few more seconds, I would like to share or remind you of some Davidisms (to coin a word): These are direct quotes and were such a part of David that none of us will ever hear these again without being reminded of him. My apologies if anyone is offended by them&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Well&#8230;To be brutally honest&#8230;I don&#8217;t give a damn!</li>
<li>Hmmmm&#8230;. I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure of that&#8230;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t give a sweet rat&#8217;s ass!</li>
<li>If my memory serves me right&#8230;</li>
<li>In a pig&#8217;s arse!</li>
</ul>
<p>And his all time favourite:<br />
Oh fuck that! Let&#8217;s have a drink!<br />
In closing, we will remember David mostly as the generous, kind, giving, helpful, friend that he was to all of us. I doubt that any friend oh his in this room did not receive his help at one time or another&#8230;<br />
Obviously I have missed some things, but as David was prone to say when he felt that you already knew the end of his story:<br />
Tra la tra la tra la&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

		<p>If you had told me that I would one day dread hearing the tune to Auld Lang Syne at five o&#8217;clock in the morning, I&#8217;d have thought you crazy.<br />
But like many things that I thought not possible, this is precisely what happened.<br />
Early on the 15th of February, Dad suffered a stroke, a result (assumedly) of his brain tumour. This put his health more into question, and bought me to Oakville on the 20th. I visited with my family, and tried to spend time with my father.<br />
I didn&#8217;t sleep well while I was at home. But upon returning to Calgary, I slept considerably worse. At first, I assume it was because of a cold that I had developed while in Oakville. But things didn&#8217;t get much better after the cold had cleared up.<br />
This morning, I realized why I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I was expecting a phone call. &#8220;The call.&#8221; My cell phone is programmed to play the tune to Auld Lang Syne when it received a call from my parent&#8217;s phone number. That is precisely what happened at 5:14:53am MST. It was Cathy. There was only one reason why she&#8217;d call at that time.<br />
David Charles Sowrey passed away this morning, finally succumbing to the cancer which had spread though his body. My father is gone.<br />
I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s hit me yet. Aside from some heartfelt best wishes, it&#8217;s been &#8230; easy. But I&#8217;m probably still a little numb, and I haven&#8217;t been home yet.<br />
Well, I haven&#8217;t been to Oakville yet. I can&#8217;t go &#8220;home&#8221; anymore. Home doesn&#8217;t exist anymore &#8212; not like it used to be. My father is dead, and with him dies my sense of &#8220;home&#8221;.<br />
It is only one of many changes to come this year. It&#8217;s by far one of the largest, and of the most significant. But it&#8217;s a welcome change. At least now Dad can rest &#8212; his pain is gone, his worries ended. And Mom and Cathy can try to get back to their lives &#8212; once they&#8217;ve &#8230; once we&#8217;ve recovered from the loss.<br />
I cannot say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe in them when someone is that close to you. His memory and spirit will live on, and will be a part of me for the rest of my life. I will not say goodbye, for I will never give him up.<br />
May you rest in peace, dear father. Find in death the peace you could not have in life.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate being sick.<br />
When I arrived here, I had a sore throat. I had thought i was because of a lack of water or fluids while in transit. It was, however, the beginnings of my first cold in a year. It&#8217;s more annoying than debilitating, but I still wish I didn&#8217;t have it.<br />
I partially blame Mom, Cathy, and Dad &#8212; their cigarette smoke has done a number on my immune system, and probably opened me up to a cold I probably wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise caught.<br />
But I do have to keep perspective &#8212; it&#8217;s nothing like what Dad&#8217;s going through.<br />
Dad&#8217;s doing well, all things considered. He&#8217;s a little slower than usual, but it&#8217;s probably due to the morphine we&#8217;ve got him on. His wits are still about him, but admittedly he still doesn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;s at home, despite another trip into the living room. They&#8217;ll try again tomorrow to convince him of his whereabouts.<br />
I however will not be here. I&#8217;m going back to Calgary. Because Dad&#8217;s condition is much better than i think we could have hoped, I&#8217;m going to return to my daily grind, until events warrant. That could be days, it could be months. Frankly, we don&#8217;t know. He has good days, he has not so good days. It&#8217;s all pretty hard to tell.<br />
I hate to leave this in Mom and Cathy&#8217;s hands. It&#8217;s a huge burden. We should share a a family. But what do you do? I have a job I can&#8217;t neglect ad a house that I&#8217;ll soon have to pay for. I love my family and would be here every second, but there are just some things I cannot do.<br />
Although I cannot compare myself directly to Dad, I hate the feeling of helplessness &#8212; knowing that there is nothing you can do, and all there is to do is wait.<br />
Cathy has been the star through all this. I&#8217;ll have to make a point to reward her for all her sacrifices and for all the pain that she&#8217;s borne for the rest of us. If anything, it will make her an excellent manager, and an unbelievable mother.<br />
But for now, we&#8217;ll just keep on living, helping out where we can, supporting each other (and Dad), and by the family we are.</p>
