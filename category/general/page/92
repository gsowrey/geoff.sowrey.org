	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve often heard it said that there&#8217;s nothing like the sound of pitter-pattering around your home. This weekend, I found that sometimes this sound isn&#8217;t so nice. Like when your hot water heater is leaking.<br />
I noticed it in the early afternoon on Saturday, shortly after the third load of laundry had finished in the washer. There was a hissing noise emanating from the basement. I assumed at first that this was from the heater reheating. But the noise didn&#8217;t stop.<br />
Further inspection &#8212; actually *looking* at the heater &#8212; revealed hot water leaking from the relief valve. This was the first time I actually had a mild panic as a homeowner. How the hell could I stop/fix this? I knew a little of hot water heaters, but not enough to fix one. Luckily for me, my sister married an original Mr. Fix-It.<br />
A phone call to Ontario found my sister and brother-in-law in the glow of having just finished the installation of their kitchen skylight. Cathy was a tad surprised to hear me ask for Craig. (Usually, it&#8217;s the other way around.) Craig gave me a few ideas as what to do, and some ideas of maintenance. The first step: hook up a garden hose and purge the tank. While purging, open the valve a couple of times and clean it out.<br />
The relief valve on a hot water tank is a very simple (but very vital) piece of equipment. A hot water tank runs at about 150 psi. While that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, if a hot water tank were to explode at that pressure, you could say good-bye to your house and everything in it. That&#8217;s what the relief valve is for. It&#8217;s set to open at 150 psi and bleed off excess pressure before something nasty happens.<br />
Except mine was just open. After purging the tank, the leak was even worse. Another call to Ontario. This time, I removed the valve from the tank. That&#8217;s when I found the culprit of all my problems. Although I can&#8217;t tell for sure, the inside of my tank seems to be lined with about a half inch of calcium deposits. If ever there was an advertisment for water softeners, this is it. The temperature probe on the valve was so encrusted, and I had to pull quite hard to get it out.<br />
Thus began my repair project: immersing in a glass full of CLR and trying to get the thing to work properly. My grandiose plans for hitting the gym and getting in a little exercise before events in the evening were rapidly going to pot. By 19:00, the best I&#8217;d been able to do is a slight (but still noticeable) leak. And that was with a lower temperature. At least I could have a shower.<br />
I left for a party hosted by Chrissie, a fellow co-worker, around 21:00 &#8212; the valve returned to its CLR bath for the next 15 hours.<br />
While we wait for the valve to soak, let me tell you about this party. Chrissie, a long-standing CM employee, wanted to throw a &#8220;nothing to do with Stampede&#8221; party. For those of you not in the know, we&#8217;re currently immersed in the Calgary Stampede, which means the invasion of this city by every cowboy wannabe in the world for two weeks of &#8230; well, probably the best explanation is drunken stupidity. I&#8217;m really glad I no longer live right downtown.<br />
Held in the southeast quadrant of town, Chrissie is in an area that I had previously thought I wouldn&#8217;t want to live in. But her house was gorgeous &#8212; owned and renovated over a few months by Capri and Jason (other co-workers). They&#8217;d done it mostly for fun. (Yes, they&#8217;re both crazy.) It made for a great party venue.<br />
The soiree had a fairly healthy cross-section of the company, new to veteran, programmer to artist. And three DJs (two of whom are on my WebDev team) who kept the tunes running for the next few hours. There were about 60 people there, though it was hard to get an accurate count &#8212; people kept coming and going all night.<br />
One of the key reasons was to jointly celebrate Cory and Laura&#8217;s birthdays (both on Sunday). And hey, like we really need a good excuse to get together and have fun. The trick is just to avoid talking about work.<br />
Shawn came out, too. It was good to see him again. Shawn&#8217;s been on leave for a couple of months, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to his return at the end of the month. It&#8217;s just been too quiet without him around.<br />
I value Shawn&#8217;s opinion, mostly because he&#8217;s about as genuine as they come. Towards the end of the evening, Shawn and I were talking on the couch, when he mentioned that it was good to see &#8220;the Old Sowrey&#8221; again. I was a tad confused at first. I know I&#8217;m among the older folk in the WebDev group, but I didn&#8217;t realize I&#8217;d become the &#8220;Old Sowrey&#8221;. But Shawn qualified this by adding that the &#8220;New Sowrey&#8221; had worried him.<br />
Basically, Shawn had remembered what I was like in my first year and a half here. I was loud, obnoxious, and apparently a lot more fun. In the last year, I&#8217;ve become much more business-oriented, more focussed, and apparently a lot less fun. The thing is &#8212; I agreed with Shawn&#8217;s assessment. My ambition to rise in the ranks had led me to reforming myself to be more &#8220;appealing&#8221; to those who would promote me. I succeeded (far more than I thought possible) in that aspect, but inadvertantly led me to failing in another.<br />
The team dynamic is everything. No-one gets into the WebDev group unless they&#8217;ve got the attitude to go along with the skill. It was that attitude that I&#8217;d slowly been killing over the last year. I&#8217;ve actually become *too* professional.<br />
Before you start objection with this analysis, I&#8217;ll point out that this was not some snap decision. This was a bit of a revelation (even if it was someone pointing out the obvious), and I did spend some time truly thinking about it. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m going to have to keep an eye on. I want to be a professional, but the last thing I want to do is have that get in the way of having fun with my teammates.<br />
We left the party around 04:00. We knew we were ready when Cory just upped and walked out the front door. I&#8217;d stopped drinking about two hours earlier, knowing that I&#8217;d be driving people home. Originally it was just Shawn. But Candace abandoned Cory at the party, meaning he&#8217;d need a lift home. And Reid, who&#8217;d somehow managed to hang out that long, asked for a ride since he wasn&#8217;t far from Cory&#8217;s place.<br />
The ride back to Cory&#8217;s was fairly quick, though he lives at the south-west edge of town. At four in the morning, most of the intersection lights are blinking (amber on the main thoroughfare, red on the minor ones) &#8212; only major intersections have their lights still in normal operation. Which was good for Cory.<br />
We hit our only red light when we got to Southland and MacLeod. Cory, sitting in the front passenger seat, nonchalantly turned and opened the door. At first, I thought he was going to get out. (Cory was still quite loaded at this point, and I&#8217;ve seen drunks do weird things at early hours of the morning.) Cory leaned over, but not to get out of the car. He cursed me later for taking so long to stop at a light.<br />
As Shawn and I returned to downtown (Shawn lives not too far from my house), we noted that the sun was taking an awfully long time to set. It was then we realized that it was so late that it was early. Already, I knew that my sleeping schedule was going to be really screwed up for the next couple of days.<br />
Meanwhile, back at the hot water heater&#8230;<br />
Awaking around 13:00 (having gone back to bed after Jim called me at 10:15 to play disc golf, which I sleepily refused), I returned to the hot water tank problem. The valve had sat in CLR all night, and was glistening clean &#8212; no more rust or calcium. Figuring this was good, I taped it up and slapped it back in. A couple small drips.<br />
Fixed, right? Wrong. There shouldn&#8217;t be any drips. So it was off to Revy to get a new valve, and some piping for a drain pipe (the previous owner didn&#8217;t have one). Luckily, this stuff is so standard it was almost ridiculous how fast I picked up the valve, a 3/4&#8243; adapter (for the pipe), a connector, a three-foot section of copper tubing, and a plumbing soldering kit (I didn&#8217;t have one yet, and it was as good an excuse as any to get one).<br />
Admittedly, I didn&#8217;t purchase the valve with the intent to replace it right away. Actually, I had hoped the dripping would stop while I was gone. I might have been able to deal with a periodic drip, but when I raised the temperature to its normal setting, gushing water sealed the fate of the valve. It had to go.<br />
Luckily, my father had taught me how to install plumbing when I was a kid. I&#8217;m no expert, but I can handle most of the simple stuff. Probably couldn&#8217;t do a home improvement show, but as far as a pressure relief valves go, I&#8217;m good as gold. All I have to do now is sit back and wait to see what will go wrong next.<br />
My bet&#8217;s on the furnace&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Canada Day, most people take the time to go do something special, like visit events in their local community or town, possibly visit one of Canada&#8217;s majestic national parks (which are free today), or visit the local taverns and have one of Canada&#8217;s national beverages with friends.<br />
Me? I hang around with trains.<br />
Okay, before everyone gets all over me for doing &#8220;the train thing&#8221; again, I have to say that this is for the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, not me. Given the choice, I&#8217;d probably have hung out in and around the just-reopened Prince&#8217;s Island Park for the day. I probably would have avoided the killer sunburn I managed to get on my face. (You&#8217;d think that since I planned ahead and brought sunblock that I&#8217;d use it. Shows how much you know!)<br />
Every year on Canada Day, the Rocky Mountain Rail Society (I&#8217;m going to write &#8220;RMRS&#8221; from herein &#8212; it&#8217;s a long name to type) puts on a &#8220;show&#8221;. It&#8217;s not really a show, but a chance for us to connect with some of the local enthusiasts, show off some of our equipment (the &#8220;Eagle Springs&#8221; combine car &#8212; no, not the farm type, a beautiful 1930&#8217;s passenger car, and our Alco S-3 diesel. This stuff usually just sits in Calgary because we can&#8217;t normally do anything with it. But on Canada Day, not only do people get to see this stuff, but they get to ride it, too.<br />
Starting last year, Don managed to get us into the old CP Ogden Shops (now the Alstom Shops) to hold our show. It&#8217;s very handy, since that&#8217;s where our equipment is being stored here in Calgary. It&#8217;s also convenient, since there&#8217;s a plethora of rail equipment from multiple owners all over the massive complex.<br />
We&#8217;d been out twice before Canada Day, getting things ready. Last Wednesday, it was vacuuming the cars and general clean-up. Yesterday, it was preparing the display and getting things roughly set up. And making a few repairs to CP&#8217;s display cars (graciously donated for the day so there was more than just our stuff around) &#8212; during switching, someone had flattened the railing needed to hook the stairs to get in. Nothing a blowtorch, sledgehammer, and prybar won&#8217;t fix.<br />
Don&#8217;t try this at home, kids, we&#8217;re experienced professionals. (We do this to 6060 all the time.)<br />
This morning was gorgeous. Which was great for me, since I had to spend the first 45 minutes awake in the gym. Arthur (friend, co-worker, and workout buddy) has put me on a new torture regimen. He claims my butt&#8217;s going to be in severe pain tomorrow. I truly hope not. Especially with all the walking and standing I did today&#8230;<br />
A massive volunteer crew &#8212; the largest I&#8217;ve ever seen for the RMRS &#8212; was beginning to assemble when I arrived at Ogden just after 11:00 (ironically enough, I was delayed by a freight train). Thus began an hour of hurried unpacking, setting up, moving of heavy objects, taping off areas verboten, and making sure everything was ready after the various cars were switched into their locations. CP loaned us the use of a SW 900 diesel-electric switcher (#6711), their historic mail car (#3266), and towed the train down the south side of the Ogden yard for about 2200 yards before returning, to give people a little ride.<br />
The crowd we got was a lot larger than I thought it would be. We don&#8217;t publicize this (for a variety of reasons), so we don&#8217;t get a lot of people. Still, most of our chairs were filled. It was pretty impressive, I think. We had the deputy mayor, the head of CP&#8217;s Heritage division, and representatives from the RCMP out to represent not only rail history, but of course, Canada&#8217;s history. It is Canada Day, after all.<br />
The afternoon shot by. Before I knew it, the clock read 16:00, and everyone was gone. We packed up, shunted the cars, and were ready to go home just after 17:00. Which was great, because my head was killing me.<br />
That&#8217;s when I realized I&#8217;d had too much sun. Tomorrow&#8217;s gonna hurt.</p>

		<p>Heat arrived in Calgary this weekend. It&#8217;s been warm here for a few weeks now (off and on, anyway), but this was the first really hot time in the ol&#8217; town. Which, of course, is a perfect excuse to flee the city for a day.<br />
A few people in Calgary (like, half the resident population) are out this weekend. Half of Critical Mass took today off so they could get a nice four-day weekend (counting tomorrow&#8217;s national holiday). I suspect the rest of Calgary ain&#8217;t much different.<br />

		<p>Today, I got a rather interesting surprise: an email from an old friend, still living in Vancouver. It appears that a couple of weekends ago, my ex-girlfriend (and ex-fiancee) got married.<br />
When I read this rather interesting piece of news, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little sad. I no longer harbour feelings towards her, one way or the other, but I found I still do for her family. I grew quite close to them when we were together, and perhaps the most pain I felt when I left was from my betrayal of their trust.<br />
No doubt I am no longer a consideration in their lives, nor should I be. I suppose that thought/feeling alone makes me sad. What is my future? I have a good job, a home, a nice car, I exercise regularly, have more friends than I really know what to do with, and have led my life as I choose to direct it. In fact, the last three years have been extremely good to me &#8212; the death of my father notwithstanding.<br />
But I come home to an empty house. I&#8217;ve got a roommate I hardly see anymore (a boyfriend and a new life outside of Critical Mass have contributed to that), and two cats. Though I love them all, they won&#8217;t share in my experiences or adventures. I have no-one to hear my victories in battle, no shoulder to cry on. Almost three and a half years. Longer than I was in any relationship.<br />
The closest I&#8217;ve come to that sort of a relationship is with Chris &#8212; possibly my dearest and closest friend. (Anyone willing to tell me I&#8217;m full of crap when I start doubting myself can&#8217;t be anything but a close friend.) Since he&#8217;s moved away, the hole in my life seems to get bigger. I try to fill it with things: new websites, trains, work, exercise. Not even the largest freight train can span the gap that I sometimes feel splitting me apart.<br />
Such was the feeling I got when I found out my ex is a married woman. There are a lot of people who believe I should feel a lot of animosity towards her. I did, three years ago. I had a lot of anger. Back then, I honestly didn&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;d feel any different as time went on. But the saying is true &#8212; time does heal all wounds.<br />
Today, I sit here and type nothing but best wishes for her and her new spouse. I hope that their lives together will be long and fruitful, that her family is happy and well. Perhaps this is the end of a chapter of my life &#8212; the last few threads tied off that allows me to move on. I don&#8217;t think this was holding me back, but that&#8217;s the strange thing about the subconscious: you never really know.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are certainly worse ways to spend Friday the 13th. There are certainly more healthy ones. But when Critical Mass decides to throw a party for its employees, you can be sure of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There will be a lot of laughs.</li>
<li>There will be a lot of drunk people. (That kind of leads back to #1.)</li>
</ol>
<p>(I should point out, for the record, that the New Year party was extremely tame. I have no idea why specifically, but it was the first time I haven&#8217;t seen at least a few co-workers completely loaded.)<br />
Unlike last year&#8217;s little surprise (see [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]]), the staff knew that this party was coming. What they didn&#8217;t know was where it was going to be. There were many theories: Sylvan Lake, Calaway Park, Banff, even whitewater rafting. Most were discounted due to distance, cost, and safety. One location that had circulated a few times was COP &#8212; Canada Olympic Park. I assumed it would not be there, since I assumed (rather poorly) that there was little for us to do there. Little did I know&#8230;<br />
Our morning began a little earlier than usual. For me, it was with a little more responsibility &#8212; I had to take a staff photo. In the six years that Critical Mass has been in business, there has never been a staff photo. This was the first time since the Kelowna trip (see [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]]) that we&#8217;ve had everyone in the same place at the same time.<br />
Since we laid six people off last week (including my roommate), we are without an &#8220;official&#8221; photographer. I guess I&#8217;m the next in line (can&#8217;t imagine why), so I was asked to take the picture. To allow this, Darrell (the VP of Operations) arranged for me to gain access to the roof of the next door building and shoot across the parking lot. Two great things about this: the angle is perfect, and the sun in the morning is great.<br />
The bad thing? Organizing that many staff is like herding cats. Which is why I was very happy to be just outside of comfortable shouting range.<br />
Pictures in hand, we boarded our busses for our unknown location (which we would soon find out was COP). We were grouped into five teams: Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, White. (These are representative of the Olympic colours, of course.) This not only organizes us, but creates the groundwork for the competitive in-your-face attitudes that we generally lack in the office.<br />
Okay, it&#8217;s a chance for us to completely mock each other.<br />
The line at the bar formed as soon as the busses arrived. It took less than a few minutes for us to be kicking back in the main tent, drinking our beverage of choice (usually one of Corona or Heineken), and getting into the groove of the day. Pat and I both remarked that in some ways, the day was reminicent of the Kelowna trip &#8212; starting the day off with beer.<br />
What I would find was that as the day went on, the more I felt like I was not in Calgary. The company had whisked us away to parts unknown to engage in a weekend of total debauchery. It wasn&#8217;t to the same scale as Kelowna (I&#8217;ll be very impressed if we ever see that again), but there was so much energy from having the entire day to do (pretty much) as we pleased that everyone seemed to forget that we were (at the core) just co-workers.<br />
We began our mini-Olympics around 10:00. The events were fairly simple, and none too difficult. (They were designed to be played by the dozen or so pregnant women currently at the office.) They included Bocce-Curling (get your ball the closest to the target), Cookie Stacking (stack Oreos as fast as you can in 30 seconds, using only one hand), Channelz (using five half-pipes, run a ball around an obstacle course, moving the ball from one channel to the next every 20 feet), Memory (remember what a bunch of articles are), and Balloon Toss (tossing a water balloon between two people, increasing the distance every throw).<br />
Oh, and there was one other event. As we arrived, 10 people volunteered for a &#8220;special event&#8221;. No-one knew what it was until it started: a Scavenger Hunt. A lot of people who didn&#8217;t volunteer wanted on, and a few who did volunteer wanted off. The details of the whole thing are still sketchy. We didn&#8217;t see the Hunters until just before lunch.<br />
Although I was part of Team Yellow, I spent most of my time running around between the various events, taking pictures. I gotta say: drinking beer and running don&#8217;t mix well at all.<br />
Participants were well-behaved. For about five minutes. I mean, come on! Put a bunch of people (mostly men, admittedly) in the vicinity of filled water balloons, and well, you&#8217;re gonna have some trouble. Suffice to say, every team that left the Balloon Toss went to their next event armed. It&#8217;s a good thing we had a sunny, warm day &#8212; a number of people got a wee bit damp. (Fortunately, our adolecently-minded staff had the decency not to aim water balloons at the women in white shirts.)<br />
Things calmed down a wee bit come lunchtime. That&#8217;s when everyone put their guns down and loaded up on food. (You&#8217;d be surprised how much acting like buffoons works up an appetite.) Nothing overly fancy &#8212; just hamburgers and salads.<br />
After lunch, we were left to our own devices. Some people went off wandering, some played mini-golf, and some went to play beach volleyball. The rest sat around and chatted. Resuming my photo run, I proceeded to find interesting things to take pictures of. For some reason, I started with beach volleyball.<br />
The five courts are wedged in the last curve of the bobsled/luge track. Unlike most of the other courts I&#8217;ve seen, these had more than the 2-3 inches that you end up driving your foot through into pavement. I took the opportunity to run around a bit and get a few action shots of people playing.<br />
My first memory card full, I took a moment to rest before heading back to get the second one. That&#8217;s when Ed suggested I come play with them. Still being inebriated enough not to know any better, I hopped out on the court.<br />
Now, this wasn&#8217;t a particularly bright idea on my part. My head (along with the rest of my body) was still swimming in ol&#8217; ethyl. The actions of volleyball &#8212; whipping the head around following the ball, diving, rolling, yelling &#8212; combine against your brain&#8217;s better judgement to stay in one place and lie down. Needless to say, it&#8217;s quite the argument my body got into.<br />
While in the midst of a set that I don&#8217;t really remember, I caught a glimpse of water balloons arcing over the trees. The angle required to get the balloons over the trees was so great that the balloons never came close to the courts. That didn&#8217;t stop me from annoucing (rather loudly) that if anyone hit my camera with one of those balloons, it would be the end of them.<br />
That statement would be my downfall.<br />
About 20 minutes later, Allard (my boss) caught us in between serves to borrow my little camera. Or rather, I thought that&#8217;s what he was looking for. In reality, he was checking to make sure I was camera-free. I hadn&#8217;t seen the audience on the hill carefully hiding my big camera.<br />
Next thing I know, there&#8217;s a line of people standing on the hill. They were in plain view. You know those old cowboy movies where the angry Indians all stand in a line at the top of a ridge? It was like that, only with water balloons. And no Indians.<br />
Somehow, instinctively, I knew to run. It didn&#8217;t matter &#8212; apparently, I&#8217;d earned the privilege of being the prime target. Two balloons bounced off me, but one made a direct hit in the front, followed moments later by one in the rear.<br />
Neil ran past. (Although he still claims his innocence, I have witnesses as to his involvement.) Picking up the two balloons, I chased him all over the courts. Then Neil got smart and stopped. Before I could do anything, he&#8217;d burst the balloon in my hand, and stepped on the other. Now balloon-less, there was only one other thing I could do: chase him.<br />
For all I know, I had a blood-curdling rebel yell as I chased Neil up the hill. Someone yelled out: &#8220;Tackle him! Go for the legs!&#8221; Remembering snippets of high school gym class, I dove and grabbed the legs. From what Arthur tells me, it was a textbook tackle. All I know is that the whole effort wore me out, and there&#8217;s no video evidence.<br />
I walked around damp for most of the afternoon (like I said, it&#8217;s a good thing it was warm), constantly shedding dried grass and sand from the escapade in the volleyball court. Although I can&#8217;t say I was the wettest that day, you could put me in the top rankings, I&#8217;m sure.<br />
The winners of the games were announced towards the end of the day. I wasn&#8217;t particularly paying attention, having reached what I can only assume was the bottom of my bottle, figuratively speaking. Team Green won, partly due to their skill (I can only assume) and subterfuge (which was widely known). Hey, it&#8217;s just a game&#8230;<br />
We returned to the office to begin the *second* event of the day. Thought we were over, didn&#8217;t you? Ha! If there&#8217;s one thing Critical Mass doesn&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s when to stop. Hmm&#8230; that&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing&#8230;<br />
Vicious Circle was our next port of call. We didn&#8217;t all arrive at once, but before long a large portion of the company had packed themselves into a seat somewhere. And at Vicious Circle we sat, talked, drank, snacked, and took strange pictures of everyone who was there. And then suddenly, almost without warning, people began to filter out into the night.<br />
Torin, Adrian, Jim, and myself headed to Ceili&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not too sure why. We ran into a couple of people from CM, but after a quick search for anyone else in the building, we found outselves alone. This meant it was time to vacate. The problem, however, was that during our search, Jim decided it was time to get another beer. (For those of you who think *I* was far-gone, you needed to see Jim.) We didn&#8217;t much want to wait for Jim to finish his beer. No problem for him &#8212; he just slipped the 3/4-full pint into his pants pocket.<br />
Out the door and down Stephen Ave. &#8212; we were headed to SkyBar, where we knew the rest of the crew could be found. We didn&#8217;t get much further past Penny Lane when I caught a glimpse of a familiar face: Sean, aka Muck, aka my cousin Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. Pam, of course, was right there. We talked briefly (the others were waiting for me, and I couldn&#8217;t very well wait around too long) before resuming our quest to SkyBar.<br />
When we reached 1st St., Jim disappeared. We were across the street from Murrietta&#8217;s, one of the cooler bars/clubs downtown. That night, they had a live band playing p-funk (basically, horn-driven music). Jim blurted something about it, and next thing we knew, he was gone. We waited around a couple of minutes, but Jim was gone. (James and I would discuss this the next day &#8212; James received two completely unintelligable voicemails from Jim over the course of the night.)<br />
Torin, Adrian, and I continued to SkyBar. There we ran into Cyndy, Ashifa, a couple of Marks, and other people I don&#8217;t quite remember now. SkyBar cover was $15. We weren&#8217;t objected to it so much as we were STARVING. Conveniently enough, Saltlik was next door. On the order for a late-night snack: a peppercorn steak.<br />
It was midnight when we hit the streets again. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, had at least that many beers over the course of the day, been water-bombed, run ragged, and my feet suddenly decided to tell me they were ready for revolt. As much as I would have liked to go up to SkyBar, my body cried out in defeat. It was time to go home.<br />
The lights were off, and nobody was home. (Except the cats, of course.) I assumed Tamara was out having her own breed of fun that night. For some reason, though, I felt the urge to look for a note. I found one on my computer keyboard: &#8220;Back in a few days. Enjoy your weekend!&#8221; I laughed, though probably more from being too tired. I crawled into bed next to Spaz, who was rather upset that I was making her move.<br />
I can&#8217;t wait for next year!<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Okay, before you all say &#8220;oh, there&#8217;s Geoff and his trains again!&#8221;, I would like to emphasize &#8212; for the record &#8212; that I only did this because the Society was desperate for people.<br />
The Society, of course, is the Rocky Mountain Rail Society. But you&#8217;re thinking I was up working on 6060 all weekend, guess again. I remained in town &#8230; at Heritage Park. The Park is a recreation of life in a prairies town/city circa late 1880&#8217;s to around 1910 or so. Depending on where you are in the Park, you&#8217;ll see roughly appropriate recreations. (I think only a few things in the Park are authentic &#8212; most were rebuilt from pictures and plans.)<br />
One of the things Heritage Park has done for the last 17 years is hold something called &#8220;Railway Days&#8221;. It&#8217;s a draw that brings out more people to the Park, and causes the local modellers and rail hobbyist organizations to come out and show off their things. Naturally, this brings out the Society to show off what we&#8217;ve got, raise a few bucks for funding, and hopefully snag a few more members.<br />
Don, who organizes all the local events (I sometimes wonder if he actually sleeps at nights), asked me to be there most of the weekend &#8212; all of Sunday. I didn&#8217;t have any firm plans otherwise, and agreed. I arrived an hour early Saturday morning, expecting to have to go through the rigamarole of setting up the displays. Everything was already in place when I arrived.<br />
I had an hour to kill. This gave me an excellent chance to wander around the Park. I haven&#8217;t seen much outside of the roundhouse, coach house, and the main street. I didn&#8217;t go for a huge walk, but got a better idea of what the Park is like. Luckily, the weather was infinitely better than last year&#8217;s (for once, I have no entry to link to!) &#8212; it was bitterly cool and rainy the entire weekend, keeping the people away. On Saturday, we had bright, sunny skies, and though it started off a little cool, warmed up very nicely.<br />
We were put into the roundhouse, along with the other commercial interests. This was a little disheartening &#8212; we&#8217;re not commercial. We&#8217;re non-profit. We sell things, yes, but just to earn some money so we can pay for projects we need to do. As it stands, we only made $600 for the weekend, and our profit margins on that stuff is quite low.<br />
Of course, we&#8217;re not there so much to make money. Our goal is to raise awareness. We&#8217;ve been around almost 20 years now, but we&#8217;re not known outside the rail community. Even within the community, we regularly get stories that 6060 has been permanently retired and put up on static display. It&#8217;s particularly a challenge when we&#8217;re told this to our faces at trade shows.<br />
It&#8217;s so much easier when you can roll your steam locomotive into a town, pop open a door and announce &#8220;We&#8217;re here!&#8221;<br />
Fortunately, we didn&#8217;t have too much trouble with people finding us. As the roundhouse is a fairly major attraction, and we were right next to the door, we had a steady stream of visitors both days. Last year, we were in the Coach House, which is virtually buried behind the railway tracks and beyond the roundhouse. Unless you happen to see the signs, you are definitely going to miss it.<br />
Oh yeah, assuming you haven&#8217;t already figured it out, Heritage Park has its own self-contained railway. It&#8217;s nothing particularly fancy &#8212; a big loop with a turntable and roundhouse, a siding for storing the &#8220;freight&#8221; train, and two stations. Two locomotives ply the rails on Railway Days (usually, it&#8217;s just one), both 0-6-0 switchers. They&#8217;re painted as CP 2023 and CP 2024.<br />
It&#8217;s with some irony that in a CP town, Heritage Park ended up with two small steam locomotives originally from (of all places) the US Army. Both started off with the Army, moved to New Westminster in BC where they worked the docks until the mid-60s. They eventually found their way to Heritage Park where they were fixed up and put to use. (They were originally US Army #4012 and #4076.)<br />
Heritage Park does have two actual CP steam locomotives: another 0-6-0, #6144, which now operates with a diesel engine; and CP 5931, one of two preserved Selkirks (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Canadian Railway Museum]]) &#8212; the largest locomotives used in Canada. (There is widespread belief 5931 could run again, but the politics behind doing so dwarf the massive engine by many times.)<br />
Amidst people coming and going (and Don running around to help out with the presentations), I made a couple of opportunities to go take pictures. When you&#8217;ve got two steam locomotives double-heading (basically, running end-to-end), you make an effort. Especially if the weather&#8217;s good.<br />
Early afternoon arrived, and we had so many people at the booth that I didn&#8217;t see a need for me to be there anymore. So making sure all was well, I ducked out to enjoy the rest of my afternoon.<br />
Sunday, it rained. It was raining when I got up, it rained off and on until just before lunch, and then rained pretty much consistently for the rest of the day. Naturally, this staved off the numbers of people we&#8217;d seen the day before, but it wasn&#8217;t *so* bad. It gave us more time to watch the videos we show constantly.<br />
I spent all Sunday at Heritage Park. It wasn&#8217;t the most rivetting way to spend the day, but at the same time I can certainly think of worse things to do.<br />
Besides, I got to watch the trains.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>While this weekend was absolutely amazing, too many of these and I&#8217;ll die from exhaustion.<br />
I started early Saturday morning. Those of you who are chiming in with &#8220;must be train stuff&#8221; can smile smugly &#8212; &#8216;cuz you&#8217;re right. But it wasn&#8217;t with 6060. This was my first chase since 6060 last year (see [[Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley]]), and this was a lot more challenging. 6060 doesn&#8217;t move very fast &#8212; it can&#8217;t because of the track it runs on. This chase, however, as significantly faster.<br />
The Canadian Pacific Railway is taking their steam locomotive, 2816, out east on the &#8220;Breakfast for Learning&#8221; tour. It&#8217;s the biggest run they&#8217;ve done since the engine was overhauled. From here to Toronto and back, in about 45 days, making a lot of stops between here and Toronto. Saturday was their first leg, from Calgary to Medicine Hat. And I wanted to follow it across the prairies.<br />
I decided I would pick up the train at the old CP Ogden shops (now owned and operated by Alstom). Although the east end of Alyth had a great place to take a picture with a bridge, the light wasn&#8217;t cooperative, and there was no place to park my car. I was the first to show up at my location, but I was soon joined by a few others: the director who was responsible for the locomotive and the train, one of the other members of the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, the parents of one of the train&#8217;s crew, and a guy who had been born and raised in the Ogden area and who&#8217;s father had opened the nearby Ogden Garage in the 1920s.<br />
The train was to leave at 7:00, but started off the day running late, for some reason. When it finally reached us, around 7:20 or so, it looked gorgeous, and running beautifully. It passed by at about 30 km/h &#8212; not very fast. Not yet, anyway. Piling into my car, I gave chase.<br />
I was hoping to catch the train at the east end of the intermodal yard on the east side of the city. But due to a wad of people getting in my way, the train ended up alluding me. Because of the much warmer weather than the last time I chased 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]), there was no steam cloud to see at a distance. All I had to rely on was the fireman every so often putting too much oil in the burner and creating a bit of smoke. I still don&#8217;t have a scanner, which makes following the train&#8217;s progress very difficult.<br />
Passing the intermodal yard, I started onto a gravel road, with two other cars in front of me. I couldn&#8217;t see anything but the dust cloud they kicked up. Finally, we reached a paved road, and I turned south to try and catch up. I reached 22X, and headed east again. I had no idea where the train was, other than it was ahead of me.<br />
The new map I had purchased at the ESSO station actually showed where the railway went, and I still had to go a fair bit south to find the line again. That&#8217;s the problem with chasing trains on the prairies &#8212; the highways rarely follow the tracks. At least on the Laggan sub, I can keep up because there ain&#8217;t a lot of room &#8212; and there the highway *does* follow the railway.<br />
I raced down Highway 24, hoping I&#8217;d be able to catch the train down there. Just as I came over a hill near to where the 24 turns east, I saw the train coming to the crossing. I arrived mere seconds before the train crossed it, but I didn&#8217;t have time to get a picture. The chase was on again!<br />
Further down the road, I stopped in a farmer&#8217;s field east of Carseland to take a picture. As the railway was curving away again, I had to race down more highways to hook back up again. I turned out on to Highway 817 and then onto 901 to continue following. At this point, the train wasn&#8217;t too hard to follow &#8212; the tracks weren&#8217;t too far from the road. The train got held up in Strangmuir for 15 minutes to undergo some greasing, which allowed me to find a comfy little field that sported a small bridge that the train was going to go over. There I found one of CP&#8217;s rail traffic controllers (RTCs), who dispatched the Brooks sub (the line we were both chasing down). He didn&#8217;t go on shift until noon, so had some time to chase.<br />
I caught the train again where the tracks cross the 901, along with a few others including an A-Channel truck. Then to Gleichen, where I met a rather racist CP police officer, snapped a photo, and ran off to Cluny. There, I met up with the RTC again. He suggested Bassano as the next decent stop, so off we went. This time, I followed him, and it was good that I did. He led me right to the best spot to get a picture. Pretty much where everyone else chasing the train was: an old CP railway station and a rather large yard.<br />
There I met a couple of far more professional photographers who suggested my next venue: the Brooks Aqueduct. Once the train had left, we were off. Brooks is about 180 kilometres southeast of Calgary, heading towards Medicine Hat. Brooks is pretty much the last stop before you enter the vast, barren plains of the southern prairies. There ain&#8217;t much in Brooks, which really surprised me when I saw on my map a marker for &#8220;Brooks Aqueduct National Historic Site&#8221;. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find. All you have to do is find the sign on the highway, and drive south until you see a huge concrete aqueduct, like a modern version of a Roman aqueduct.<br />
But modern it isn&#8217;t. I parked in the interpretive centre&#8217;s lot, and was immediately met by Lee, one of the two interpreters at the site. She was a little puzzled by why I was there &#8212; though most of their visitors come from Calgary. I explained that I was chasing a train. Yes, I did get a rather strange look. She recommended that I walk down the aqueduct canal to the siphon, which was apparently the best place to see trains in the area. Thanking her for the advice, and promising to come back, I went off in search of my quarry.<br />
The canal is a huge earthen trench built up on the floor of the shallow valley that Brooks sits in. Barely 100 metres to the north of the canal is the old aqueduct, no longer in service. (More on it in a moment.) I walked until the canal &#8220;ended&#8221; at the railway &#8212; where an inverse siphon runs under the railroad and re-enters the canal on the other side. The siphon works on the venturi principle &#8212; basically, what goes in has gotta come out.<br />
I was well ahead of the train, which gave me a lot of time to wander around and find the best place to take a picture. By the time I&#8217;d found the ideal place, three more photographers showed up, including the guys who&#8217;d told me about the place. We took our positions and waited.<br />
Soon, the light appeared in the distance, and the train raced towards us. Though not going at full speed, it didn&#8217;t take long to pass. I have to completely agree with Lee and the photographers &#8212; the aqueduct was the best place to see this train.<br />
I returned to the interpretive centre, where Lee came out to meet me. I asked her for her perspective on the aqueduct. (I told you I was getting back to this.) Back in the early 1900s, CP was in the colonizing business. There was a lot of money to be made in bringing people to the west. Especially if you&#8217;d bought all the land around the railway tracks when you built them, and sold it off to the immigrants who paid you to come west. However, not all parts of the west were ideal for farming &#8212; some are quite dry.<br />
Such is the case with the area east of Brooks. No significant rivers, no lakes, and little rainfall poses a lot of problems. To make the area saleable, CP had to provide water for irrigation. This lead to the need to dam the Bow River at Bassano, then move the water through canals to the east. At Brooks, the land forms into a shallow valley that created a problem &#8212; without massive (and expensive) pumps, there was no way to get the water to the east. CP&#8217;s engineering department came up with the solution: the Brooks Aqueduct.<br />
At 3.2 kilometres long, and upwards of 90 feet tall, it was the largest aqueduct in the world at the time. It pushed all the boundaries of construction knowledge, which also led to problems. Most revolutions don&#8217;t go off very well the first time. The alkaline water dissolved the concrete, the lead expansion joints leaked constantly, the spars across the top of the sluice caused backflow, and the 0.01% grade kept the water moving so slowly that silt, plants, and even fish slowed the water flow. The aqueduct only ever reached 2/3 of its planned capacity. After an extensive and expensive overhaul in the 1930s, the aqueduct was turned over to the local farming collective.<br />
By the 1970s, the aqueduct was costing too much to repair. The local governments decided to replace it with an earthen canal that provided more water than the aqueduct ever could have (even if it had reached full capacity), and doesn&#8217;t leak. The old aqueduct was made a National Historic Site in the 1980s.<br />
I drove down the length of the aqueduct to get a good look at it. Well, as much as I could. Once decommissioned, the aqueduct no longer received maintenance. To prevent injury, a fence runs around the perimeter. A gap in the fence did allow me to sneak in for a couple of pictures from underneath. The western end, completely cut off from the original water supply, is now home to the local party hangout, identified from the graffiti, countless broken beer bottles, and the still-smouldering remnants of a fire. The view down the aqueduct is something else.<br />
It was about then that I noticed the time: 12:45. I needed to be back in Calgary for a party at 14:00. I was going to be late.<br />
I pulled into the car wash at 16th Ave. and Edmonton Trail just before 15:00. The car had turned a brownish green (from all the dust), with multicoloured speckling (from all the bugs). It was shiny in only a few minutes. Then it was my turn to get clean.<br />
I arrived at Shantie&#8217;s house just before 16:00. This was a soccer party, and as near as I could figure, I was one of the only non-soccer people invited. Needless to say, I wasn&#8217;t too keen to leap right into the game. Mostly because I haven&#8217;t played since high school, and even then I was terrible. I resolved to sit in the weak shade of a tree (not all the trees here have sprouted leaves yet) and take pictures. The six-year old daughter of one of the guests noticed it right away and asked if she could use it. It&#8217;s a durable little thing, and I figured &#8212; could get some interesting pictures.<br />
The girl, Shayla, took almost 150 pictures over the next few hours.<br />
The game ended around 17:00 and we retreated to Shantie&#8217;s house (across the street from the soccer field) to engage in conversation and food. John (one of the other guests) tried to engage in a battle of wits with Shayla. The six year old won, hands down. It was just the beginning.<br />
Shantie has some really great friends. They&#8217;re hilarious to hang around with, and are in no way exclusionary. They even knew when to pick on me because I brought veggie burgers. (Relax, I haven&#8217;t gone vegan &#8212; but I&#8217;ve had these sitting in my freezer for a year, and I gotta eat &#8217;em.)<br />
I ended up talking with Lindsay for over an hour about Japan. (She&#8217;d been there in high school.) We talked until it was just too cool to be away from the fire pit everyone else had gathered around. (I should note that it was gorgeously warm, and it was just a slightly cool breeze that was making it uncomfortable. Besides, we were feeling left out.)<br />
By midnight, everyone had left, including myself. I&#8217;d been up for 18 hours, was harbouring a half-dozen sunburns, and needed some serious sleep.<br />
Today was the Lilac Festival in Calgary. I didn&#8217;t go to it this year, as I felt I had more pressing things to take care of: namely the small army of dandelions that were laying siege to my front lawn. Screwdriver in hand, I went to eradicate the little buggers from my grass.<br />
Most people use chemicals when they get rid of weeds. I&#8217;m not a big fan of chemicals in the yard, not even fertilizers. I prefer the natural, brute force methods. I even use an unpowered push mower to cut my grass. Yeah, it&#8217;s hard work, but you feel better for it. Especially when total strangers thank you for not using chemicals.<br />
While there was still a lot of afternoon left, I went for a walk along the river, taking in the sights and sounds of the World Walk, or something like that, taking place at Prince&#8217;s Island Park. I didn&#8217;t spend long, so I don&#8217;t really know what it was all about. I had a mission: I needed to get my bike.<br />
People were everywhere. Calgary becomes very active when it gets warm. When there&#8217;s a festival on, you almost have problems moving at times. Along all the major strips, the patios are open and full. Everyone is enjoying the outdoors again. Summer is definitely here.<br />
Now if it would just rain so we could all cool off&#8230;</p>

		<p>When I finally arrived home from my stint with the CBC so many months ago (see [[Home for a rest]]), I was happy to be back. It will be nice to be home after my trip to Japan, even though it&#8217;s sad to leave it so soon.<br />
When I arrived almost two weeks ago, I had no idea what to expect. There were a lot of questions, intrepidation, excitement, and desire. The fear would not last long, and I certainly got a healthy dose of adventure. But there is simply too much to see and do in Japan &#8212; you could visit for a year and before you could see enough to be satisfied.<br />
