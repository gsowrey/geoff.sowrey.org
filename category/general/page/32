		<p>It seems that good things do happen to those who wait. Surprisingly enough, that also applies to me.<br />
You may recall some weeks ago, [[The Hell of my job|I lamented Critical Mass&#8217; ability to see the need to promote from within]]. It wasn&#8217;t so much about me as it was about using the resources we had, and not stalling forever on putting people into open positions.<br />
I kept raising the red flag. I was, well, a kind of whistle-blower, but only in reminding management that we were rapidly heading for a serious problem if we didn&#8217;t fill the position that I knew needed to be filled. I bugged Allard, and I bugged Cory. I wanted to make sure that we would have some sort of movement on the issue.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I have officially become mobile. Today, I picked up the keyboard for my PDA, and am able to create my log entries wherever I am on the planet.<br />
And have an electrical socket to recharge the batteries. (Minor detail.)<br />
Wait a second &#8230; you probably have no idea that I have a PDA. Actually, I&#8217;ve had a PDA since 1996 &#8212; an Apple Newton. It was given to me by my boss when I worked at Arkipelago in Toronto. When I left, my boss told me to keep the Newton.<br />
I used it for a couple of more years, but it slowly fell out of favour with me, mostly because it wasn&#8217;t as convenient as I would have liked. The major issue was size &#8212; the Newton is a size of a thinnish brick. Weighs about as much, too.<br />
I did without a PDA for years. For the last three, most of my notes were written just like everyone else&#8217;s &#8212; on notepaper. The more notes I wrote, though, the more likely I was to forget things. Finally, upon taking over the Web Development team on Mercedes-Benz, things finally got too much.<br />
I take a lot of notes, and can sometimes get lost in details &#8212; no different than anyone else. I can&#8217;t allow myself to forget too much, though, lest it impede my job. I finally decided a PDA which could sync itself with my daily schedule was what I really needed.<br />
Research. Anything that&#8217;s gonna cost me more than $100 requires research. I had a set of requirements that I needed to fulfill. One was the need for handwriting recognition. I didn&#8217;t want to learn a new alphabet &#8212; like the Palm systems force you to do. I also wanted something that would synchronize with my calendar. That brought me to looking mostly at Pocket PCs.<br />
These things run on Microsoft software. That I&#8217;m not particularly thrilled about, but I have to accept the fact that to get what I need, I sometimes have to make sacrifices.<br />
After about three months of research (periodic, not continuous), I came to rest on two models: the Dell Axim X5, and the Toshiba e330. The Dell was the superior model for functionality and expandability, but was quite a bit larger. The Toshiba was smaller, but more limited. About equal price.<br />
It finally came down basically to a coin toss. The coin was tossed the night I replaced my watch battery &#8212; the store (Battery Plus) had a Toshiba. I nearly closed the store from all the humming and hawing. It came down to a demonstration period.<br />
According to the clerk, I had two weeks in which to decide if the PDA was what I needed. During that time, I could do whatever I wanted. So long as I didn&#8217;t damage the unit, I could bring it back for a full refund if I felt it wasn&#8217;t for me. It hasn&#8217;t been two weeks yet, and I&#8217;m sold.<br />
As the saying goes: so far, so good. Well, almost. When I first picked up the keyboard today, I couldn&#8217;t get it to work properly. Naturally, my first impression was that it was defective. Not wanting to retain a defective piece of equipment, I decided to pay Staples a visit (that&#8217;s where I bought it).<br />
I didn&#8217;t immediately ask to return it. My first initial thought was to check and see if, just perhaps, I wasn&#8217;t using it correctly. (Hey, it&#8217;s possible.) I got the feeling the clerk had been through this before, and promptly asked if I&#8217;d installed the software.<br />
I wasn&#8217;t even aware the keyboard had additional software. It stood to reason, though, that if the appropriate driver wasn&#8217;t installed, some of the more advanced functions of a keyboard might not work.<br />
Frankly, I don&#8217;t consider the enter key to be an advanced function, but I had to give it a shot.<br />
Whipping off to the office, I pulled in the PDA and inserted the CD into my desktop computer. A moment later, the software was installed. A test of the keyboard revealed that nothing had changed. A little puzzled, I hunted for some setting that might shed a little light on the problem.<br />
It turns out you have to enable the keyboard before you can use it. Doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me, but hey &#8212; if it works, then great!<br />
So I now have an almost completely portable website content-creation machine. Now if I can just figure out how to hook my camera into this thing&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Normally, around this time of year, I rant about the really dumb decisions the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science makes when awarding their own. Normally, it&#8217;s because they give Oscars to those who &#8220;deserve&#8221; the award, not those who&#8217;ve earned it.<br />
Not this year. This year, I actually have to praise them for making the hard choices.<br />
Last night, I convinced Tamara and her friend Todd to watch the Oscars. Didn&#8217;t take much &#8212; all I had to say was that &#8220;Bowling for Columbine&#8221; was up for Best Documentary. That was enough in Tamara&#8217;s books to watch the rest of the ceremony. We missed the beginning of the show, but came in just as the awards were beginning.<br />
Okay, let&#8217;s get most of the nitty-gritties out of the way. Best Animated Feature Film could only have been Hayao Miyazaki&#8217;s &#8220;Spirited Away&#8221;. Having seen all the other nominees except &#8220;Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron&#8221;, there was but one choice. Best Supporting Actor and Actress (Chris Cooper and Catherine Zeta-Jones) gave me no reason to argue (though I might have preferred John C. Reilly in &#8220;Chicago&#8221;). &#8220;Chicago&#8221; scooped most of the primo awards, but considering the competition, that wasn&#8217;t all that surprising.<br />
But the night was a rollercoaster of surprises. Unlike previous years where the winners were always predictable, this series seemed to play to the underdogs and renegades of the industry. Adrien Brody winning Best Actor for &#8220;The Pianist&#8221; threw a lot of people &#8212; I was expecting Daniel Day-Lewis. (Not that I&#8217;m arguing with the choice.) Eminem taking out music heavyweights like &#8220;Chicago&#8221;, U2, and Paul Simon was extremely welcome (although the guy who accepted could have least had the decency to wear something better). The Best Original Screenplay went to a foreign film, &#8220;Talk to Her&#8221; &#8212; an Oscar rarity. And despite all the controversy, Roman Polanski won the coveted Best Director.<br />
Nothing was more surprising, and more pleasing, than hearing &#8220;Michael Moore, &#8216;Bowling for Columbine'&#8221; being read out. Both Tamara and I cried out in joy. Frankly, I thought Moore&#8217;s chances of winning were virtually none. Heck, I was shocked that he was even nominated! (Though I had a personal note never to watch the Oscars again if they didn&#8217;t nominate the movie. I guess someone listened to me for a change.)<br />
If you&#8217;re wondering why I was shocked about the nomination, you obviously haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;Bowling&#8221; or know who Michael Moore is. The guy is possibly the single most politically-charged firebrand in the States at the moment. (Even previous Academy Awards where Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon made statements barely even come close to what Moore did.) In &#8220;Bowling&#8221;, he asks a lot of hard questions, though finds it almost impossible to actually get them answered. He even confronts Hollywood heavyweights Dick Clark and Charleton Heston. Both come out looking a lot dirtier as a result. Heston takes a cinematic beating, however, retreating from Moore&#8217;s questioning by merely walking away.<br />
For those insults, I thought Moore&#8217;s changes of a nomination were nil. Okay, so he gets nominated &#8212; no chance he&#8217;ll win. The institutionalization of Hollywood won&#8217;t allow it. I would kill for a video tape of the production booth when &#8220;Bowling&#8221; won. The producers probably dove immediately into recovery mode. Because as soon as the standing ovation ended, and the quick thank-you was done, they knew that Moore&#8217;s political views would turn the heat up inside.<br />
Hell of a way to get a ratings boost, though.<br />
So the speech was barely cut short (Adrien Brody actually managed to get an extension, but finished his war speech far more tactfully than Moore&#8217;s), but the point was made. I think that&#8217;s all Moore really wanted to do. I don&#8217;t think he returned for the rest of the evening. Mind you, after his speech, producers might have just avoided showing him again. Steve Martin (the host) joked that Teamsters were helping Moore into the trunk of his limo. It was Moore&#8217;s first Oscar, and my guess is that it&#8217;ll be his last. Something tells me, though, that he won&#8217;t mind too much.<br />
I want to thank the Academy, for doing the right thing for a change!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been a long time, but I&#8217;ve gone back to school.<br />
The last time I took a class (see [[Why I Don&#8217;t Want to be a Technical Writer Anymore]]), it was for work. I wasn&#8217;t learning anything I didn&#8217;t already know, and I wasn&#8217;t really all that happy about it. This time, I&#8217;m taking something I have (some will say) far too much interest in, and (so far) have been really happy with. What is this wonderous education that I&#8217;m receiving? What is this subject in which I&#8217;m so engrossed?<br />
I&#8217;m going to Steam School.<br />
Okay, you can stop groaning now. Yes, this is related to trains. But not in the same over-the-top manner many seem to expect from me. (Either I&#8217;ve set far too many precedents, or people seem to expect a lot.) It&#8217;s actually an Antique Steam course, which is something I need to take so I can start my safety training for steam boilers.<br />
Why steam boilers, you ask? Remember my girlfriend? (See [[Steam Train with CN 6060, Stettler to Big Valley]].) Well, she needs more people trained to maintain and operate her. There&#8217;s a lot of work involved with running a steam locomotive, especially one with a boiler the size of 6060&#8217;s. And with the bulk of our society getting older every year, we&#8217;re in a pinch to make sure our newer members (e.g. me) have the necessary training.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; the course I&#8217;m taking now doesn&#8217;t even come close to qualifying me to even getting me in the cab while the locomotive is running. As with all things, it&#8217;s a step in the right direction. Once I&#8217;ve obtained this permit, then I can start working towards my Class 5 permit. That will, at least, get me in the cab during operation. Then it&#8217;s a matter of time and training before I can write my Class 4. I need a Class 4 to operate 6060&#8217;s boiler &#8212; in other words, apprentice to be a fireman. (It&#8217;ll be a number of years before I can be an engineer.)<br />
The class met at Pioneer Acres, a museum in Irricana, about 45 minutes northeast of Calgary. The village of Irricana is small, only about 1,000 people. It was likely once a railway town (the CN mainline &#8212; formerly Grand Trunk Pacific&#8217;s &#8212; to Edmonton runs through Irricana), but has since become little more than a small farming community. The village is surrounded by vast acreages.<br />
Our instructor was late, caught in the snow where he lives. Although a chinook and the onset of spring has pretty much wiped out the snow in most of Alberta, some parts are still in a deep freeze. No-one seemed to mind too much, though. For the $100 fee, a large number of us are having the fees covered by employers or our respective museums and historical societies. It gave us a chance to get to know eacy other a little better.<br />
The instructional material is &#8230; well, not so much in-depth as it is cohesive. Sounds a little odd, I know, but allow me to explain. Although I haven&#8217;t spent a huge amount of time with the Rocky Mountain Rail Society, my education started the day I showed up in Warden (see [[Reunion with Steam Locomotive CN 6060]]). Sometimes it&#8217;s just someone telling me the name of a strange blob of cast iron. Sometimes, it&#8217;s telling me how it works. If I&#8217;m really lucky, I get to see it in pieces. However, none of it really seemed to make sense.<br />
The course I&#8217;m in is primarily aimed at safety. Steam engines (stationary boilers, traction engines, and locomotives alike) are all very dangerous. Even a stationary pressure vessel with pressures as low as 20psi can explode with disasterous consequences. 6060&#8217;s boiler runs at 260psi. As you can guess, safety is covered repeatedly during the session. The safety isn&#8217;t so much for us (though that is important), it&#8217;s mostly for the public. No steam engine would exist today were it not for the public wanting to see it operate. They&#8217;re far too expensive to own and operate without funding. So with the crowds we expect come the rules needed to operate them.<br />
Over the last two days, I&#8217;ve received a very clear picture of how certain elements of a steam boiler operate. Most of them to me were textbook concepts. Our instructor make sure that the ideas that once seemed so simple were carefully explained. Luckily, we have several in the class who can explain things a little further. The SAIT instructor even managed to fill in the missing bit of information that finally cleared up how a steam injector operates. (Of course, having some knowledge of physics and thermodynamics actually does come in handy.)<br />
I still get strange looks from friends and coworkers whenever I tell people about the things I do in my spare time. I guess most people expect that I would work on a computer all the time. With my job being close to the leading edge of computer technology, I guess I prefer having a hobby that has nothing to do with computers at all. There&#8217;s a certain amount of relaxation that comes from working with something that predates the electronic age. Something that has no knowledge of microprocessors (the federally-mandated radio notwithstanding), no cares about lines of software code, and no relation whatsoever to the mass-produced garbage of our era.<br />
It might weigh more than 23 times the average city bus, but our nigh 60 year-old toy always seems to lift off the worries of my little world.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Last October, I bade farewell to my newly-made friends from the CBC Train (see [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Halifax finale|5 October 2002]] and [[Touring Halifax, Part 1|7 October 2002]]). Since then, I have only talked to them over email and phone. It&#8217;s not the same as being there in person. And I&#8217;ve missed a lot, too &#8212; I get emails from some of them telling me about events and run-ins with the crew. Living out here, I feel pretty separated.<br />
So imagine my excitement when I saw a note from Angela informing me that CBC (specifically Angela and Tracy, who handle CBC Newsworld) were coming to Calgary for two nights of free documentaries. All she asked was that I tell a few people.<br />
I figured about 300 would be enough.<br />
I arrived at the Glenbow Museum at about 18:40, well before the 19:00 start time. Angela and Tracy were holding the inner doors open, and greeting people as they arrived. Simultaneously, it felt like only a moment had passed since I&#8217;d seen them last, and a lifetime.<br />
We talked for a while at the door, I stepping out of the way of arriving visitors. But soon it was time for the movie, and I wanted to go find a seat. That wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; the theatre was mostly empty. Although I had tried to tell as many people as possible, it can take a bit to get Calgarians to go out and do something, even if it is free.<br />
The documentary was &#8220;The Hockey Nomad&#8221;, the filmed version of Dave Bedini&#8217;s &#8220;The Tropic of Hockey&#8221;. (Dave Bedini is the rhythm guitarist for the Rheostatics, and a self-proclaimed hockey fanatic.) A couple years ago, Dave had travelled the world looking for hockey. He&#8217;d found things like a tribe in remote northern China, a national team in Mongolia, rumours of a rink in the Amazon, and things that to even the most aware North American hockey afficianado would sound peculiar.<br />
Such was the case of this movie. Dave and his camera crew visited three places: Ciuc (pronounced &#8220;chuck&#8221;) in the Transylvania region of Romania, ice rinks in the United Arab Emirates, and Ulan Baatar, the capital of Mongolia. He came to do one thing: Play hockey. Dave is a great story-teller, and even a subject like hockey (which can make even the most avid player roll his eyes) was completely fascinating. The story was compelling, and all the while featured a Canadian perspective.<br />
Afterwards, Dave came down to answer questions of the audience, and of a local broadcaster who had his own set of questions to pepper around. Questions were plenty, and the answers interesting. Soon, it was 21:00, and time to wrap things up. I walked over to Tracy and Angela in an effort to see if maybe they wanted to grab a coffee and have a quick chat. They countered with an offer to tag along with their group.<br />
We headed first to Saltlik, hoping to get into the lounge. Completely full, we opted for the James Joyce, just down the road. Tracy, Angela, and I were soon embroiled in our past. I felt kinda bad, though &#8212; they&#8217;ve already been through this with the others in Toronto. I have not. The only person out here is Enza, and I haven&#8217;t had time to get together with her for a chat.<br />
For a time, it almost felt like we were in some dark corner of a bar in the middle of the prairies. (Okay, we *were* in a dark corner of a bar in the middle of the prairies, but that&#8217;s beside the point.) I could have sworn that if I&#8217;d turned around I&#8217;d see Emma, Roger, Amy, Chris, Gerry, the Bills, the Robs, Neil, Jule &#8212; the whole crew doing what we did best: Be together as a team.<br />
It was all over too soon. Work calls as always, and I have early mornings at the gym. I left my part of the tab, and bit Tracy and Angela goodbye. Tomorrow is another movie, which I will unfortunately miss, and then they are off to Edmonton. It will probably be a while before I see them again.<br />
Though the saying may go: &#8220;The world is getting smaller&#8221;, it still seems far too large for me.</p>

		<blockquote><p>One is left with the horrible feeling now that war settles nothing; that to win a war is as disastrous as to lose one.<br />
<cite>Agatha Christie</cite></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>War is not nice.<br />
<cite>Barbara Bush (wife of Fmr. President George Bush, and mother of current President George W. Bush)</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>A little over 12 years ago, I sat on the floor of my bedroom, watching in silence as the Gulf War burst into horrific life. I had been greatly saddened by the events, and greatly worried that our world was about to boil over into something much more serious.<br />
Imagine my shock when I sat down to watch a little television tonight. At 19:45 MST, the White House spokesman stepped onto the podium, saying that operations had begun in Iraq, and the President would be addressing the nation in 30 minutes. I had planned to do some work. Instead, I suddenly felt 12 years younger, and a lot more worried about the future.<br />
When Dubya went on the air a half hour later, I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what to expect. Except for armageddon, of course. Sure enough, through all the rhetoric, the message was quite clear: The &#8220;Allied Forces&#8221; (comprised mostly of America and British forces) had started their attack on Iraq. Exact details weren&#8217;t clear, but from what I could glean from CBC and CNN, the US had launched a barrage of missiles into Iraq as part of a &#8220;decapitation&#8221; strike, trying to take out Iraqi leadership.<br />
No matter how you try and make it sound nice, a &#8220;decapitation strike&#8221; sounds about as appealing as a root canal without painkillers.<br />
I can only imagine what we&#8217;ll see in the coming weeks. No commentator can agree on the details. Some think this will be a fast war, some think it will drag on for weeks, maybe months. Some say the Iraqis don&#8217;t have a lot to offer in the way of defence, others suggest that the Allied forces are outnumbered four to one. They are agreed on a couple of things: the US will spend countless billions to fund this war, and a lot of people are going to lose their lives. And it&#8217;s almost certain that the protests will begin tomorrow.<br />
There are two sad ironies in all this. First, the US can&#8217;t really &#8220;restore&#8221; democracy to Iraq. If they do, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that the electorate will vote in a follower of Islam, who would more than likely not bow to the will of the US. So Iraq will likely be run under a US-positioned puppet. At least until that person decides that they don&#8217;t want to listen any more, start doing their own thing, and bring the US military back in about two decades.<br />
Second, terrorism will likely increase as a result. No-one seems to have considered this part. Striking an Arab nation (even one run by a despot) will only succeed in angering neighbouring nations. Most certainly, this will raise the fur on Al Quaeda&#8217;s back. We can only certainly expect a reprisal at some point.<br />
It&#8217;s debatable whether the Iraqi people are going to be better off as a result of all this. Everyone seems to be speaking of them, but more concerned with their own self-importance and sword-waving. Only the United Nations seems to have a rational head on their shoulders. It&#8217;s too bad that legally, they&#8217;ll have no recourse against the US and UK. It&#8217;s all fine for the UN to crack down on a small rogue nation. But what do you do when two of your most powerful nations go renegade? The coolest heads seem to be coming from France and Germany: Two countries that know all-too-well the horrors of war and of occupation.<br />
I find it interesting that 65 years ago, another nation that opted to force its opinion and will on others started the &#8220;War to end all wars&#8221;. It was horror the likes of which no-one had seen before, and has brought us 60 years of stories (fictional and non).<br />
Actually, I take that back. It&#8217;s not interesting. It&#8217;s frightening.<br />
&#8216;Cuz we might end up with a front row seat.</p>

		<p>I found out today that I&#8217;ve become middle management. I&#8217;ve become my own arch-nemesis.<br />
Critical Mass has (almost) finished its massive organizational effort. It&#8217;s not really a reorganization, per se, but it is a process that we&#8217;ve needed to go through for a very long time.<br />
This year, Critical Mass turns eight years old. It&#8217;s been almost six years since the launch of our first website. I&#8217;m employee #175, and new people are in the #400 range. We&#8217;ve got a lot of people that need organziation to get through their daily lives. So with the introduction of Thelton, our new COO (well, &#8220;new&#8221; as of September), we dove into the melee of putting an actual structure into Critical Mass.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today is the first anniversary of my father&#8217;s death.<br />
The last time I saw my father was over a year ago (see [[A Slight Ray of Sunshine on a Very Cloudy Day]]). Since then, all I&#8217;ve had are pictures and the memory of the sound of his voice. I have no home movies, no audio tapes. Just memories that will fade with time, eventually to the point where I can barely remember him.<br />
I no longer speak of Dad in the way I used to. Now it&#8217;s with more reverence, and with more humour. For some reason, I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of using phrases that are prefaced with: &#8220;As my father used to say&#8230;&#8221;, even if I know full well he never said those things. I attribute many of the things I know to him &#8212; most of my home maintenance and renovation skills (most of which, admittedly, is unproven), my (limited) knowledge of automobile mechanics, some of my financial sense (though I have to give most credit to Cathy, also known as my financial advisor), my love of adventure, my desire to travel, and a purpose in life.<br />
Dad didn&#8217;t teach me all these things. I learn a lot through observation. (Hence, my &#8220;Observer&#8221; moniker.) And I certainly cannot mention learning without mentioning Mom. She taught me the rules of life, probably the hardest rules to learn. Mom knew me better as a child than I knew myself.<br />
It&#8217;s been a year without my father. And it&#8217;s been a strange year. A couple of months ago, my family started discussing the possibility of what to do on the anniversary. There had been talk of Las Vegas. Not Dad&#8217;s favourite place, but I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d appreciate the need for celebration rather than mourning. Dad never was a big fan of that.<br />
Hopefully, today will pass without notice. I have no plans to call anyone in my family. Unless I need to. Today, I think all that I may do is find a quiet corner of a bar or pub somewhere, and have a glass of Scotch in my father&#8217;s name.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>With Cathy at work, and Craig sleeping for the day (he&#8217;s currently working nights), there was little that would cause me to rise early.<br />
Well, almost nothing. I had a lunch date to keep.<br />
Rising at a reasonable hour, I showered, shaved, dressed, and headed out for the GO Train (thankfully, within walking distance &#8212; though I ended up jogging most of the way there). My ultimate destination that day was the corner of Bloor and Spadina. On the south side, a few blocks west of that corner, I would find New Generation Sushi, where I was planning to meet up with my dear friend Kathryn.<br />
I should emphasize the word &#8220;planning&#8221;. You see, at that point, planning was all Kathryn and I had done. We hadn&#8217;t really *confirmed* anything. I had left a couple of messages with Kathryn, and over the course of the morning, kept calling to see if things were still a &#8220;go&#8221;. But the cell phone wouldn&#8217;t pick up, nor would the land line be answered. Deciding that in the worst-case scenario that I&#8217;d still find something to do, I proceeded with the plan as I knew it.<br />
I hopped the University line upon arriving in Toronto and headed to the Spadina station, mistakenly believing that it was part of the Bloor line station as well (meaning it was near Bloor St.). Of course, it wasn&#8217;t, and was several blocks to the north. No big deal &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t that cold, and was worth the wander. Besides, I was almost an hour ahead of schedule, and had a little time to kill.<br />
I&#8217;ve gotten really good at killing time. I really need to get &#8220;Professional Time Assassin&#8221; business cards printed up.<br />
I found the restaurant, but passed it by in favour of seeing what else I could find in my spare time. Almost reaching Bathurst, I spotted a Starbucks on the north side of the road, and suddenly felt the need for a hot chocolate.<br />
I soon found myself sitting in a Starbucks on the corner of Bloor and Albany, the radiant sun pouring into through the south-facing window, warming my back, the hot chocolate heating my soul. Sitting by the window, listening to Jazz playing in the store, watching Toronto pass by in their daily lives, I felt purely decadent. For a powerfully brief moment, I remembered what I liked about being in Toronto.<br />
Kathryn and I finally connected, and confirmed plans to meet up at the restaurant at 13:30. This meant I still had a little time to kill. So I wandered down Bloor St. back to Spadina, crossing over and coming over to the restaurant. I got a seat for two and started to wait. Thankfully, Kathryn is punctual.<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering how it is that I can meet up with Kathryn at 13:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. Doesn&#8217;t she have to work? In fact, Kathryn is one of Toronto&#8217;s shining stars, and a very busy stage manager. Since leaving school, she&#8217;s done 35 shows of one kind or another. Thirty-five. (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve done that many websites.) Her line of work keeps her busy, but usually at night (during production, that is), meaning her days are somewhat free.<br />
Currently, Kathryn is engaged in a play called &#8220;China Doll&#8221;, which is about the Chinese tradition of foot-binding, which ended around 1911. The play starts in the early 1900s and goes until 1917. Had I more time, I think I would have very much enjoyed seeing the play.<br />
We talked for about 45 minutes before finally ordering food. Then we walked for another half hour before the food arrived. We ate, chatted a bit, then talked more. Finally paying the bill, we headed out down Bloor St., still talking. We babbled the whole way into Yorkville, and into cups of coffee and hot chocolate. We chatted until we could chat no more &#8212; and that was only because Kathryn had to go to work, and I had to go meet up with my friend Ed down at Union Station. So we talked all the way to the Museum subway station.<br />
It had been almost exactly three years (give or take a couple of days) since Kathryn and I had spent a significant amount of time together. There had been a bit of time when Kathryn had attended my sister&#8217;s wedding (see [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]]), but because of things that had to happen, we had talked only briefly before she&#8217;d had to leave for a performance that night. Three years. So needless to say, when Kathryn&#8217;s train disappeared into the tunnel as I waited for mine, there was a distinctly hollow feeling &#8212; I don&#8217;t get to see my close friends often enough.<br />
It had been nearly a year and half since the last time I saw Ed (see [[Star Wars and the Last Episode of The X-Files]]), but he hadn&#8217;t changed much. The hair was a bit longer, a little lighter (due to some streaking, so I understand), though he looked a lot more tired than I had remembered. (Given how hard he was working, that wasn&#8217;t too surprising.) We met up and headed off for the 17:34 train to Oakville.<br />
Brian was waiting for us when we arrived. I don&#8217;t really know for sure, but I think the last time I saw Brian was New Year&#8217;s Eve, 1998. Aside from the hairdo, he hadn&#8217;t changed, either. The three of us piled into Brian&#8217;s sports car, and went off in search of a place to hang out for the evening. We ended up at Sharkey&#8217;s.<br />
Sharkey&#8217;s has been a mainstay in Oakville for ages. Apparently, it won&#8217;t be for much longer, as it is slated for demolition. Oakville needs another block of condominiums. But for now, it still reigns supreme on the shores of the 16 Mile Creek, and in the bar, we set up shop to catch up on old times.<br />
Brian and Ed were roommates of mine at the University of Waterloo, living in the Columbia Lake Townhouses. We shared the four-room unit with my roommate from first year, Roger. (Roger is currently living in Prague, so unfortunately was unable to attend the reunion.) The four of us had spent an almost bizarre eight months living under the same roof. It had been together that we&#8217;d witnessed the Blue Jays winning their first World Series, and the Montreal Canadiens winning their last Stanley Cup. And numerous other events, including the Penny Fight, broken shower floors and back doors, watching the &#8220;ducks&#8221;, scaring the hell out of each other, The Neutral Zone, and chemical warfare.<br />
Brian and Ed have had the luxury of seeing each other quite a lot over the last few years. So needless to say, I felt like a bit of an outsider. But it&#8217;s not too bad &#8230; they made sure I felt completely included in the massive string of insults and personal attacks, all good-natured, of course. This was how we&#8217;d conducted ourselves in university, which more and more felt like it was only months ago, not years.<br />
Things have changed over the years, though. We all got engaged, though only Brian, Ed, and Roger got married. I supposedly had enough sense to back out of my engagement before it was too late. Brian is now separated, as is Roger. We joked quite a lot about the &#8220;Columbia Lake Curse&#8221;, and kept looking at Ed to see if he was next in line (for the record, he gave no indication that he was).<br />
Although it was a time I would have gladly continued until the bar closed, both Brian and Ed have to work tomorrow. Such is the sadness of being on vacation &#8212; you can&#8217;t always do what you want to do. But plans are sort of in the works for later this year, as I might be coming out for a camping trip with the guys. It&#8217;s been far too long since the last time I camped.<br />
They dropped me off at Cathy&#8217;s, and I bid them both a good night. I was brought forward into the present, leaving the past of university behind. But it won&#8217;t be the only time on this vacation&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is about this time of year, but I seem to have a penchant for buying expensive things. Last year, I bought a house. This year, I bought my first new car.<br />
For those of you now saying: &#8220;He bought a Mini&#8221;, you would be correct. There are a few of you out there who said I should have bought the Cooper S (the sport version). A little too expensive for me right now &#8212; maybe in a couple of years, I&#8217;ll trade in the one I have. A few of you might frown on my little green bag. Of my favourite deterrents, one even called it a &#8220;girl car&#8221;. Personally, I always thought that was a VW Cabriolet. Call it what you will, this is the only street legal go-kart I know of.<br />
Not even a week ago, I was in the general vicinity of the Mini dealership, and thought I&#8217;d drop in to have a chat with Michael, the Mini salesperson who had been fielding my seemingly endless questions. Unfortunately, he wasn&#8217;t in that night. Another salesperson, also named Michael, chatted me up. We talked about the Mini, and a little about the one I wanted. Michael &#8212; the one I had been talking with before &#8212; had indicated there were a few on-site that might match my needs. Michael &#8212; the one I was talking to at the time &#8212; had some additional ideals.<br />
My criteria were pretty simple: I wanted a cool, distinctive car that had no practical purpose. Yeah, I know, &#8220;mid-life crisis&#8221;. Frankly, if I&#8217;m having a mid-life crisis now, I need help. A lot of it. I think the reality is that I&#8217;m, well, boring. Yes, I&#8217;ll admit it. Dull. Blah. Without any sense of edge. Predictable, even. (Don&#8217;t believe me, check out the comments a few people wrote about me in a survey I sent out a couple years back. See [[Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about Geoff Sowrey]] for details.)<br />
When Stuart had first shown me a picture of the new Mini a couple years ago, I about freaked. It was perhaps the coolest thing on four wheels I had ever seen. For the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been following the launch of the Mini worldwide, and especially in Canada. For a while, I&#8217;ve lamented living in Calgary &#8212; we were one of the last major cities in Canada to get a Mini dealership. (Saskatoon got one before us. Yes, Saskatoon.) Anyway, about as soon as one opened here, I started looking.<br />
At Christmas, Critical Mass gave me a bonus (why, I&#8217;m not really sure &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure if I really earned it). While I&#8217;m not at liberty to say how much, it was enough to make me seriously give thought to buying a new car. I guess I need not elaborate on what direction this took me.<br />
Anyway, back to the second Michael. He showed me a model he had sitting in the showroom. It was a demo unit purchased by Mini Canada (Corporate Office) for one of their executives. When they were done with it, the Calgary office purchased it for resale. At a discount. And so began what ended up being a three-day bargaining session. Mini would come to me with a price, and I would turn it around, looking for incentive. It wasn&#8217;t easy &#8212; unlike other dealerships, Mini has the luxury of waiting for the next person to snap up a waiting vehicle. As it stands, I was the first of about five people interesting in purchasing that car.<br />
It&#8217;s British Racing green. (Dark green, for those of you unfamiliar with the colour.) White roof and mirrors. White alloy wheels. Beige leather interior. And really, really, really comfy. So what was the catch?<br />
Manual transmission.<br />
The interesting part is that I actually went out looking for manual. Why? Two reasons. One, it&#8217;s more fuel-efficient than the automatic (a general rule). In fact, the manual transmission Mini Cooper is one of the EPA&#8217;s Top 10 most fuel efficient cars. Secondly, it&#8217;s because I didn&#8217;t really want to get the automatic. It&#8217;s a CVT &#8211; Continuously Variable Transmission. Basically, no gears. While an uber-cool idea, I was a little paranoid of what would happen if it broke &#8212; how much would it cost to fix? Manuals are less expensive.<br />
Problem: I&#8217;d only ever driven manual once before (see [[Long Weekend in Kelowna, Penticton]]). I know the principle. It&#8217;s just the practice. Which I need.<br />
Now I have one other problem: Where to park it. I can&#8217;t leave the car parked on the road (the city doesn&#8217;t really like that). Naturally, I should park it in my garage. That&#8217;s what I tried to figure out on Saturday &#8212; clean it out, and prepare it for a car. But very early on, I realized I was going to have a major problem: The garage door.<br />
One of the previous owners (I&#8217;m not sure which) decided to sabotage the garage door and remove all the gizmos that let you open and close the door. The door itself is nailed in place. Opening and closing it at present requires two people and a hammer. Not exactly convenient. Closer inspection made me believe that I wasn&#8217;t going to solve my problem with a screwdriver and a mallet. No, I needed a new door.<br />
Off to Revy, where after a few minutes, I happened upon a gentleman by the name of Gerald, who got me the details. Luckily, I have a standard-sized door for my somewhat unstandard garage. It wasn&#8217;t exactly cheap to purchase the door, but I opted also for installation and removal of the old door. I&#8217;ve learned from many people that you simple do not try to install a garage door unless you know what you&#8217;re doing. And aside from the fact that it would take two cars to carry something as large as a garage door, I have no idea what to do with it anyway.<br />
Returning door-less (it comes some time this week), I proceeded to clean out the garage. I succeeded only with the returnable recyclables (we get money back for the containers for which we pay deposits). That pretty much left me incapable of walking, mostly as a result of my first week at the gym. I finished the following day, though not without injury &#8212; I now have a terribly sore throat.<br />
I hate being sick.<br />
Tonight, I signed away what little life I have left after the house, and picked up my new car. This was a good thing, since I was barely able to concentrate on sqwat all day. It took about an hour and a half, including all the financial work, and the walkaround. Yes, a walkaround. You don&#8217;t just drive away from a BMW dealership &#8212; you get the full meal deal. Which is good, because there were a few little things that I wouldn&#8217;t have known otherwise.<br />
I picked up Tamara from home, and we went for a drive. First, to the office to pick up proof of earnings, which I had mistakenly forgot at the office. After faxing that in, we went in search of a Shopper&#8217;s Drug Mart. I needed throat lozenges, very badly. Then it was to Dairy Queen for a quick celebration, and back to the house. As I sit here typing, I can hear the car calling to me.<br />
&#8220;Drive me!&#8221; it coos.<br />
But I need to go to bed &#8212; I have to be up early to go to the gym. I must resist its lures. All I can do it wait with baited breath for the weekend, when I can drive free of the city &#8230; and practice my hill starts without backing into anyone. Maybe I&#8217;ll get Therese and Stuart to teach me.<br />
This time next year, I&#8217;ll have to refrain from anything too expensive. Right now, I&#8217;m thinking of a Snickers bar.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A little exercise never killed anyone &#8230; but there&#8217;s always a first time.<br />
This morning, I made my first visit to a gym in about seven years. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, and no, it&#8217;s not some lame New Year&#8217;s resolution that I&#8217;ve finally got around to. I&#8217;ve actually been wanting to do this for over a year and a half, but found every excuse I could to avoid it. Now I have a vested interest in fitness, and made an effort to give myself no option.<br />
On Saturday, I dropped by the YMCA in Eau Claire, forked over the fee, and got myself a membership. I then went out for a new pair of shoes that I knew I was going to need. This morning, I woke at 5:30, grabbed my bag, and headed out to see what new definitions of pain I could discover.<br />
Actually, I wasn&#8217;t quite that negative. I had a fairly ambitious goal: An hour workout without passing out, heaving up, or needing the assistance of emergency medical sevices.<br />
Laugh if you will, but to say my mind and body are at odds when it comes to exercise is like saying Israel and Palestine are bosom buddies.<br />
Body: I need exercise! Get me in shape, Mind!<br />
Mind: I hate exercise. It&#8217;s so monotonous.<br />
Body: Either you get me exercise, or I&#8217;ll start craving things you won&#8217;t like.<br />
Mind: Ha! Go on. I&#8217;m not scared of you. You have no power over me.<br />
Body: One word: Tequila.<br />
Mind: Is 6:00 okay for you?<br />
Of course, once things get underway, there&#8217;s a sight reversal&#8230;<br />
Body: SWEET JESUS! What were you thinking?!<br />
Mind: Hey, don&#8217;t blame this one me! You&#8217;re the one who wanted this, pal!<br />
Body: Yeah, okay, but 10 kilometres of rowing, 20 kilometres of biking *uphill*, and then a 15-minute endurance swim? That&#8217;s just mean!<br />
Mind: Stop being such a baby, it&#8217;s not that bad. It&#8217;s just mind over matter.<br />
Body: But I don&#8217;t have a mind &#8212; that&#8217;s you!<br />
Mind: Not my problem&#8230;<br />
One of them is gonna kill me. It&#8217;s just a matter of time&#8230;<br />
The Eau Claire YMCA is about 15 years old. The shape that it&#8217;s kept in, you&#8217;d swear no more than a third of that. The facilities are huge &#8212; they have to be for the number of people who come through there &#8212; and immaculately kept. The equipment is in great shape (although the footstraps on the rowing machine kept coming loose), the place is spotless, the air temperature about perfect, and the water in the pool is devine (except the near-lethal levels of chlorine).<br />
So yes, I hurt. Not a lot, mind you &#8212; I didn&#8217;t do weights. That&#8217;s tomorrow morning. Mostly, it&#8217;s my head. Muscles are beginning to remember that they hold this 20-odd pound of meat in place, and they&#8217;re not really enjoying the extra workout. My inner thighs hurt, but it&#8217;s not from muscles &#8212; my skin has the approximate texture of a cheese grater thanks to the near-desert climbe, and the aforementioned chlorine.<br />
And then there&#8217;s my hands, or more specifically, the skin just under where the finger attaches to the palm. All the callouses I&#8217;d built up when I was with the CBC have apparently worn off. I noticed this when I was showering afterwards &#8212; that burning sensation on my skin couldn&#8217;t be due to anything but inflammed skin. Sure enough &#8212; blisters. Big ones. I guess you got to start somewhere.<br />
My morning went from one workout at the gym, to another workout at the dentist. This was my regular six-month checkup. I hoped it would go much better than my visit this time last year (see [[Going to the Dentist, Getting my first Cavity]]). For the most part, I was right. First exercise in futility: x-rays. Captain Choke struck again, and x-rays were delayed for another visit. Onto scaling and polishing. Snooze. Then it was inspection.<br />
This is the part I&#8217;m beginning to hate. Everytime I get an inspection, the dentist finds something wrong. I&#8217;m not sure if my mouth is just falling apart, or if previous dentists were morons. Either way, as he was probing my teeth, he muttered something about &#8220;D5, inclusion&#8221;, which in dentese apparently means my tooth has gone &#8220;soft&#8221;. In other words: return visit on Thursday for correction.<br />
I just hope it doesn&#8217;t mean drilling.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://geoff.wp/2003/02/chinese-new-year-4700-space-shuttle-columbia/" rel="bookmark">Chinese New Year 4700, Space Shuttle Columbia Explosion</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The year 4700 on the Chinese calendar got off to a very sombre start.<br />
Today is Chinese New Year&#8217;s day. Today, I had many things I wanted to do. Most of them were summarily forgotten when, barely a few minutes out of bed, Tamara announced: &#8220;The space shuttle blew up.&#8221; I took pause. I was barely awake enough to know that this was bad, but not awake enough for it to truly have effect.<br />
I marched downstairs and turned on CNN. The coverage wasn&#8217;t as intense as September 11th (see [[Reaction to September 11, 2001 (9/11)]]). CNN was skipping commercials, in favour of coverage. They flipped around constantly, talking with reporters from all over America, periodically talking with an official or former engineer. CBC had entirely different coverage, actually bringing in Roberta Bondar to talk with their anchor. A press conference with the Canadian Space Agency featured Marc Garneau.<br />
There wasn&#8217;t the oppressive feeling of loss or shock. Perhaps we&#8217;ve just become too immune. Then an interesting fact came to light &#8212; it was 17 years and four days since the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded over the Atlantic Ocean, 73 seconds into the 25th shuttle mission.<br />
Just after noon, I was doing my duty as a student crossing guard, curbing the flow of traffic so students could return to school after lunch. As usual, one girl &#8212; a few grades behind me &#8212; came up to deliver her daily torture. For some reason, we didn&#8217;t much like each other. She was a little caustic, and I had a superiority complex. Yet we each recognized this, and turned it into a game. On that day, however, she instead told me the truth: The shuttle had exploded.<br />
At first, I hadn&#8217;t believed her. The shuttle couldn&#8217;t explode. It was the space shuttle! It was NASA! That sort of thing just doesn&#8217;t happen. (This was long before I&#8217;d learned of the Apollo 1 fire, or saw video of NASA&#8217;s early rocket failures.) My faith in the American space programme was unfaltering. I expected there to be regular flights into space by the time I was 20. For the shuttle to explode just seemed too fantastic.<br />
The truth sank in before I returned to school after lunch. Most of my friends didn&#8217;t go home for lunch, and didn&#8217;t know. They seemed as doubtful as I had been. Barely a few minutes into class, the principal called an assembly in the gym. It was true. The shuttle had exploded barely a minute off the launchpad. I don&#8217;t remember the rest of the afternoon. But I watched the entire 6:00pm CityTV news broadcast, which had been almost entirely devoted to the shuttle disaster (only five minutes were granted to other news).<br />
Seventeen years later, the reaction was different. People seemed shocked, yes, but more were accepting of the dangers of spaceflight. It seems that while people do become complacent about regular shuttle launches, they seem to all know that eventually, something will go wrong. When Tamara had told me the shuttle exploded, I assumed it was a launch. Breaking up on reentry was something I had not considered.<br />
I eventually did run a few errands. But in the back of my mind the entire time was what sort of things could I expect to see. Thoughts of what I&#8217;d seen on September 11th still haunt me. I saw and heard nothing. It was almost like it hadn&#8217;t happened. In fact, if Calgary had been upset by the disaster, it was already well on the way to recovery. Chinese New Year went ahead without pause. It was business as usual.<br />
Still, everyone seemed to talk about the loss of Columbia, even if it wasn&#8217;t the first thing on their minds. We still went to Chinese New Year dinner. We still went about our lives. But the thought is still there. I don&#8217;t know if in 17 years, I&#8217;ll remember where I was today.<br />
But I will remember what happened.</p>

		<p>Like most people who work the ol&#8217; 9-5 grind, my weekend started just as the whistle blew Friday afternoon. It was time to get my nose off the grindstone and into something far more pleasant. A beer.<br />
Not that I want to sound alcoholic (as if I don&#8217;t already sound like that from previous entries &#8212; see most of the entries from the <a href="/index.php/category/cbc-tv-50th-anniversary-via-rail-train/">CBC train</a>, [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]], [[My Housewarming Party]], [[Critical Mass 5th Anniversary Surprise Party]], [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]], [[The Critical Mass Summer Social 2001]], [[Download Overload, the Critical Mass Kelowna Getaway in Westbank]], etc.), but this time I actually had a pretty good excuse. There were a fairly large number of birthdays on my floor of the office (referred to as &#8220;Technology&#8221;, &#8220;The Technical Floor&#8221;, &#8220;Domain of the Extremely Geeky&#8221;, &#8220;Realm of the Magicians&#8221;, and the &#8220;Second Floor&#8221;, depending on who you ask), and a few of us went to celebrate Carl, Nathan (recently returned from Europe), and Jude (who could not join us until later).<br />
It&#8217;s good to get out with other members of the Technology department &#8212; I&#8217;m so isolated working on my account that I rarely ever see them again, except in the two neutral zones on my floor: the washroom and the kitchen. This is our chance to sit around, chat about pretty much anything but work (although it&#8217;s inevitable that we do), and act like idiots &#8230; okay, so it&#8217;s not much different that at the office. But at least we can drink.<br />
Following our beverages, we plummeted ourselves back into the -25 degree evening for the second part of the show. The festivities of the evening were divided into three parts: Vicious Circle (the bar/club where we like to hang out), Sakana Grill (about the only place in town for large groups to go for sushi), and roller skating. I avoided the third part mostly due to a total lack of coordination. That, and I really didn&#8217;t feel like adding that kind of fodder to my journal entries.<br />
I hadn&#8217;t been to Sakana Grill for months with a group (I&#8217;ve been there with Therese and Stuart a couple of times). The last time any large number of us were there was when we said farewell to Chris, Nathan, and Jen as they prepared to leave the company (see [[Preparing to Move to Japan]]). Nathan, Carl, and I were extremely happy to arrive. The temperature outside was bitingly cold, even by my standards. Carl and I opted to warm up with sake. We mistakenly ordered a 1/2 litre of it. Not that I was about to complain&#8230;<br />
We had at least 25 people crammed around two tables. We were loud. Loud enough to attract the new head chef. The last time we&#8217;d been there, Peter had not appeared. Peter was the guy Carl always managed to goad into giving us free rounds of sake. But Peter seems to be gone. Instead, we got Tony. Tony seems a pretty good replacement. He&#8217;s not as quick on the insults (which were one of Peter&#8217;s trademarks), but he&#8217;s a lot more generous with the sake. No-one seemed to mind.<br />
As I previously mentioned, I bailed on the roller-skating. I wanted to be relatively alive the following day. I had plans. Big ones.<br />
I even woke up early. Well, sort of. Earlier than I normally do on a Saturday, but early enough. I was going to make a trip up to the northwest quadrant to visit a car dealership. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that I need a new car. My current one is fine, but I want something newer. Something funkier. Sure, I could very easily keep the car I&#8217;ve got, but let&#8217;s be honest &#8212; I&#8217;m young, I&#8217;m (fairly) well off, and I think I can afford something far more fun than my &#8217;91 Plymouth Acclaim. Could I buy a new Chrysler? Sure. A new GM? I suppose so. How &#8217;bout a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan? Definitely. Do I want to? Not really. At the moment, there&#8217;s only one car I actually want.<br />
A Mini.<br />
Possibly the single most impractical car I could imagine, save for a two-seater coupe. The question is, of course, do I need a practical car? The answer is &#8220;heck no&#8221;! I&#8217;ve got a house with no plans to move any time soon. I&#8217;m not married, and the only dependants I have right now are two cats and an inanimate house.<br />
I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Geoff&#8217;s hit his mid-life crisis&#8221;. Maybe I have, but I have to say that my father went through more exotic cars by my age than I&#8217;ve had cars, period! I figure, I&#8217;ve earned it. (Okay, maybe I haven&#8217;t &#8230; but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t want to have fun!)<br />
At any rate, I went up to the sole Mini dealership in town, and flagged me down a car salesman. Doesn&#8217;t take much &#8212; just look like you want to buy. We walked, we talked, we inspected, and we rejected. Finally, he hauled me downstairs to their protected underground garage, and we hopped into one of the cars for a little zip around the area.<br />
The salesman, Michael, drove first. Along the way, he told me a little about himself and a lot about the car. It&#8217;s a fairly impressive bit of engineering. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t Minis little more than a patch of tinfoil wrapped around an engine?&#8221; The original Austin Minis were known for their &#8230; well &#8230; mini-ness. They were small, light, and little more than go-karts with substantial chassis. The new ones were redesigned from the group up by BMW, and contain mostly BMW parts. Think of a 325i crammed into half the size.<br />
I guess I need not mention that it&#8217;s a great drive? It&#8217;s also a bit of a weird drive. While I wanted to give the manual a spin, my experience with a stick shift is a little weak. I opted instead for the automatic. Doesn&#8217;t sound like much, does it? This ain&#8217;t no ordinary automatic. It&#8217;s a continuous shifting transmission. In short: No gears. It&#8217;s a large steel belt that slides up and down cone-shaped driveshaft. It&#8217;s pretty ingenious. And you don&#8217;t ever feel a gear shift. It&#8217;s a little unnerving at first.<br />
The question, naturally, is: Can I afford it? I&#8217;ve got my financial advisor working on it. I expect a negative result. I might be well off, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m *that* well off. Hey, I gotta try!<br />
I left the dealership carless &#8230; well, Mini-less. (I still have my Acclaim.) There were other events of the day to tackle, and I needed to get home fairly fast. I still had to tidy up the main floor a little (it&#8217;s looking more like a U-Store than a dining room), sweep the floors, shower, change into something a little more appropriate, and head out to the Zoo.<br />
Why the Zoo? Critical Mass did not have a Christmas Party in December, like we had in the past. This year, for what reasons I&#8217;m not entirely sure, we delayed the party until the latter part of January. Unlike the visit to the Scandinavian Centre (see [[The 2001 Critical Mass Christmas Party]]), this was at the brand-new Destination Africa exhibit at the Calgary Zoo.<br />
It&#8217;s impressive. According to our tour guide, the Zoo spent over $31 million overhauling the exhibits, giving the animals more room (and more comfort), and increasing the educational value of the Zoo itself. In fact, the entire Zoo is undergoing a series of radical changes. In the coming years, other parts will be upgraded to increase available space, and improve animal&#8217;s living conditions.<br />
Which is important when you have -25 degree weather and animals that live in climates that are usually 50 degrees warmer.<br />
Our party didn&#8217;t start until 4:00. I met up with Shantie at the Zoo C-Train station and proceeded to start on a tour of the Zoo. I&#8217;d never been there before. Shantie&#8217;s been an annual visitor, usually because of nieces and nephews. But the Zoo had changed quite a lot since she&#8217;d last been there. And with the wind whipping around, we made a point to enter the nearest warm building we could find.<br />
We went to the Transalta Rainforest first. But more on that place later. Next, we braved the brisk outside and raced over to the greenhouses, where the Zoo has recreated a rainforest and a desert environment. It&#8217;s almost all plants, except for songbirds in the rainforest, and a couple of meerkats in the desert.<br />
Plunging back outside, we hopped over to the Large Mammals building, which save for a pair of ostriches (which Shantie knows a lot about &#8212; her father used to raise them), a couple of elephants, a warthog, a flock of peahens, and a tapir, was mostly empty. Most of the animals are being moved to the Savannah building &#8212; I figure the Large Mammals building is on the list for overhaul.<br />
We circled the rest of the Zoo, our pace quickening with each second we were outside. The trip back was torture, as we now headed into the wind. I lost feeling in my ears. My thighs were going numb. By the time we reached the African Lodge, we were probably running risk of frostbite. The warm air of the Lodge was very welcome.<br />
The tour began about 20 minutes after we arrived. Our guide, Stuart, took a group of us from the Lodge and into the Rainforest. Now we get back to what I skipped before. The Rainforest building is new &#8212; only opened about two weeks ago. It&#8217;s very impressive &#8212; all the trees are real (except the baobab &#8212; it&#8217;s a cold air return duct), and there are animals everywhere. Two of the most impressive parts are the gorilla enclosure, and the aviary.<br />
The gorilla enclosure is massive. It&#8217;s got a huge indoor area that you can view from several angles, a small outdoor &#8220;winter&#8221; enclosure, and a rather large outdoor summer enclosure. The family of nine apes gets along quite well, save for the newbie. (She was raised by humans and hasn&#8217;t quite figured out that she&#8217;s actually a gorilla.)<br />
The enclosure was also supposed to have a set of Colobus monkeys. However, it seemed that the keepers and the architects couldn&#8217;t really overcome one minor problem: Colobus monkeys are really devious. The enclosure is hot-wired &#8212; there are electrical lines that run the perimeter of the main area, and even up the trunks of three trees. Fences prevent escape, and the surfaces are non-graspable. Didn&#8217;t stop the monkeys. The just upped and ran. Luckily, the building goes into lockdown in cases like that, so the monkeys couldn&#8217;t get away.<br />
The aviary is completely netted off, for a similar reason. So far, nothing&#8217;s escaped. Impressive when the birds could probably fly between the mesh if they tried (or rip it open), and there are three ring-tailed lemurs inside. The lemurs are a hoot to watch. When we&#8217;d come through the first time, you could barely see them amongst the massive support poles. But this time, the lemurs were in plain sight &#8212; 70 feet up in the rafters of the roof. The must love the heights.<br />
From the Rainforest we moved to the Savannah &#8212; a huge building that houses warthogs, porcupines, a nasty-lookin&#8217; vulture, two giraffes, and two hippos. Unlike the Rainforest, you can see pretty much everything in the building from anywhere. The central point, of course, is the 80,000 litre hippo tank. Ungainly on land, these creatures swim like ballerinas when submerged.<br />
Returning to the Lodge, most of Critical Mass&#8217; employees had arrived with their guests. The lobby was full of chatting people, with others having moved into the hall. The entire building has an African motif (for obvious reasons), which include the paint on the walls, the tablecloths, and the main chandelier &#8212; a dugout outrigger, fitted with lights in the hull.<br />
Dinner was buffet-style, nothing overly fancy. But all very tasty. The difficult part was seating &#8212; there weren&#8217;t a lot of tables. The centre of the room had a wood floor, which was surrounded by chairs, and filled with various instruments. This was part of our entertainment for the night.<br />
Not long after dinner, the music started. People took seats around a small group of people in the middle. Instructions were given, and the people in the middle (not C-Massers, but musicians hired for the job) started to play. All the instruments, save for a single keyboard and one guitar, were all percussion.<br />
It was a drumming circle, for lack of any better term to use. The musicians in the centre started the rhythm, which everyone else picked up on. The leader slowly brought everyone in until there was a single pulsating chorus of drums, cowbells, and shakers. The leader rose the sound up, and took it down as a conductor would lead an orchestra. The energy was amazing.<br />
An hour later, most people were drummed out. It takes a lot of energy, and a few people had a headache from it. (The room&#8217;s acoustics are quite good, so you could hear very well.) Following the drumming was, of course, dancing. Few people danced at first, partly because everyone was a little tired from drumming, and also because Critical Mass is like a high school at times, and no-one wants to be the first out.<br />
The DJ compensated by starting a conga line. It weaved all around, trying to suck up people. It was quite successful, but the line broke so often that we ended up with about a half-dozen lines running through the building.<br />
The show closed down at midnight, sharp. That was the rule from the start. We picked ourselves up, aimed for the door, and waited for the shuttle bus. Although the wind had died for the night, it had to be nearly -30 outside. This is the second time Critical Mass has had these temperatures for their holiday season festivities. (The last time, I walked &#8212; or rather, stumbled &#8212; about 15 blocks back to my apartment. Luckily, I was insulated by a protective shield of booze at the time.) Shantie gave me a lift home, rather than freeze on the C-Train.<br />
The only thing that was really missing from our soiree? No drunken stupidity. In what is probably a first for a Critical Mass function, everyone left relatively sober.<br />
Yeah, I&#8217;m as puzzled as you are.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s the beginning of the year. It&#8217;s quiet. I&#8217;m (somewhat) relaxed. That&#8217;s probably why I&#8217;ve got a cold.  At least, I think it&#8217;s a cold. It doesn&#8217;t behave like most rhinovirii I&#8217;ve had in the past &#8212; no fever, no stuffy feeling, no constantly-dripping nose. In fact, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s actually given me anything. Although it has taken something away&#8230;<br />
My voice. I can barely whisper, let alone say something.<br />
[Insert thunderous cheers from everyone sitting around me here.]<br />
Yes, many people around here have been enjoying the drop in noise level. I&#8217;ve even had a few people mention that things seem different, only to find that I can&#8217;t say anything. And, of course, I&#8217;ve had those jokers who seem to think that it&#8217;s their responsibility to make comments about my vocal disability, even to the point of deliberately asking me questions that I need to answer.<br />
I have to remember to cough on their keyboards.<br />
It&#8217;s a weird feeling. My larynx has an an extremely faint soreness to it, but that might just be from me clearing my throat when trying to say something. Otherwise, I feel fine. In fact, I&#8217;ve forgotten more than once that I can&#8217;t say anything today, until I hear that airy chirp that emits from my mouth. I don&#8217;t have a frog in my throat, I&#8217;ve got a mouse.<br />
This all started yesterday morning. I came to work with a sore throat. I thought it was due to dryness in the house. Barely halfway into the morning, I could hear my voice cracking. It was puberty all over again. By the end of the day, talking was forced. (I had to take Spaz to the vet again last night. More pills to ease her breathing. Now if the little furball would just take them&#8230;)<br />
When I woke up this morning, I thought I was fine again. Then I tried to talk to the cat. (Yes, I talk to the cat.) Squeak. Spaz snapped her head up, thinking she heard a mouse. I tried to say something again. Squeak. Spaz stared at me hungrily. Nothing like a just-shy-of-six-foot tall mouse! I opted to shower before she got any ideas.<br />
So today, I have relied tremendously on the modern technology of text. Email and ICQ have been my best friends today, allowing me to continue with my job without saying a word. Of course, Allard still likes to ask a question or two, making me cringe at what I&#8217;m going to sound like next.<br />
I just hope this starts going away soon. The pack of cats following me around is getting a little worrisome.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Another year, come and gone&#8221; it wasn&#8217;t. This has perhaps been the single most turbulent year of my life. I had the deep low of my father&#8217;s death, coupled with the meteoric high of participating with the CBC 50th Anniversary train. Many times I thought I was going to lose my sanity or even my job. Perseverence, not to mention blind faith, helps moves things forward. But I did live up to a few things last year (see [[2001, A Year in Review]]): I spent more time out of the office. Not really getting a life, but it&#8217;s a start.<br />

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This has simultaneously been the quietest and the busiest Christmas season I think I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I had been looking forward to two weeks of quiet rest, working on personal projects, sleeping, watching movies, and trying my darnedest to relax before the beginning of the new year.<br />
Life loves to mess around with my plans.<br />
Officially off on 20 December, I resolved to sleep &#8230; well, once I had my shopping done. So on the 21st, I wandered down to Chinook (via the C-Train, mostly because I knew parking would be a disaster) and see what I could see. I saw little, except hoardes of people all trying to find the perfect gift. I decided to try my little trick of last year &#8212; find what I want, see a matinee, and shop when everyone else had gone home for dinner. Only problem: No movie I hadn&#8217;t already seen was available at the right time. I had to return to shopping &#8230; but only at two stores. I retreated to downtown where things tend to make more sense.<br />
My mother arrived in town on the 23rd. The plan, originally, was to have the entire family out in this neck of the woods. But Cathy and Craig ended up stranded in Southern Ontario. Airfare, especially during the Christmas season, is far too pricey for people in the midst of a kitchen renovation. We would miss most of their precence this year &#8212; the second Christmas that Cathy and I would spend apart.<br />
The first Saturday and Sunday were occupied with me running errands and cleaning. I didn&#8217;t know when family was going to start dropping by. I had also hoped to finish my Christmas shopping before then. Ya, right. I didn&#8217;t finish shopping right up until the 24th &#8212; my usual timeframe.<br />
One of these days, I&#8217;ll have enough smarts to start earlier. Probably when I can get someone else to do it for me&#8230;<br />
I spent Christmas Eve with two of my closest friends, Tara and Scott, and our friend Geoff. (Yes, having two Geoffs in the same room makes conversation challenging. Getting the both of them drunk makes it funny.) It was a seafood smorgasbord: shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster. We ate, laughed, and carried on until into the wee hours. Mostly because we had to make sure Geoff (the other one) was &#8220;safe&#8221; to go home. Geoff, it seems, has an allergy to shellfish.<br />
The one day I had been really looking forward to was Christmas morning. I was looking forward to sleeping in. Tamara was with her family out past Tisdale, Saskatchewan. It was just me and the cats. And a 7:30 wake-up call. I had to pick up my mom from her hotel. The story had unfolded the day before:<br />
Me (picking up the phone): Hello?<br />
Mom: Hi, it&#8217;s me! Here&#8217;s the plan for tomorrow. We&#8217;re going over to Brenda&#8217;s [my aunt]. Pick me up at 8:30.<br />
Me: 8:30 at night? That&#8217;s a little late for dinner, don&#8217;t you think?<br />
Yes, I actually said that. It took me a moment to realize what was really meant.<br />
I spent Christmas morning with my family. It was nice not to have to open presents &#8212; well, I had to open a few, but they were small. After this year, small is the best I could ever want. Dinner was a turkey tsunami &#8212; all wonderful, but as usually, too much. (I ate way too much this holiday season &#8230; as per usual.)<br />
Boxing Day is North America&#8217;s single largest day of pure capitalism. It&#8217;s a chance for everyone to become completely moronic, act without care of fellow human, and rack up even more debt. So, yeah, I went shopping.<br />
But not until about 11:00am. I wasn&#8217;t willing to get up early. And I wasn&#8217;t willing to visit any of the main malls. I kept it quiet and simple: A&amp;B Sound and HMV, both downtown, and both in walking distance. A&amp;B Sound was a zoo &#8212; people everywhere, and none of them really finding what they seemed to be looking for. Of course, the store had opened at 7:00am, and people had started lining up at midnight. That kind of thing I just do not understand.<br />
On the 28th, we celebrated Nana&#8217;s 90th birthday. Nana is my sole living grandparent. Her actual birthday isn&#8217;t until late January, but this was the most convenient time to have most of her family come and celebrate with her all at once. So for one night, we zipped one month into the future to wish Nana a happy birthday. Even Cathy and Craig made an &#8220;appearance&#8221;, through the magic of pre-recorded messages on video tape.<br />
Like almost every Tisdale clan affair, it was met with far too much good food. I arrived almost four hours ahead of Nana (she was off with my Uncle David, exploring the Kananaskis) to help prepare the meals. We had a wide-ranging theme of dishes, including Vietnamese salad rolls, Asian scallops, mini crab cakes (Jen and I spent the better part of an hour cracking crab on the only available surface &#8212; the floor), and the coupe de grace &#8212; a huge roast beef. I didn&#8217;t eat the next day until almost dinner.<br />
Before I knew it, it was Mom&#8217;s last day in town. We spent it partially at the mall, where we browsed several shops, and also at my home, where she visited with Spaz. There is never enough time for everything, though &#8212; soon, she was back at the airport, and I was watching her through security on her flight back to Toronto.<br />
New Year&#8217;s Eve &#8212; a night when most people (like Tamara) go out and have fun. Me? I watched Minority Report, The Emperor&#8217;s New Groove, and barely half of Lord of the Rings before I called it a night. I wasn&#8217;t interested in going out. It&#8217;s been a hard year. It was a night I wanted to spend alone.<br />
With all the family, activity, and distractions, I didn&#8217;t start feeling really relaxed until this morning. I woke just before 11:00am, and ventured downstairs to watch TV. Exciting, eh? But I had a reason &#8212; today, in theory, would be my moment of national fame. In theory, I&#8217;d be on CBC.<br />
Following the Governor-General&#8217;s and Prime Minister&#8217;s messages to the country, CBC aired the last remaining show of their 50th Anniversary celebrations &#8212; a 50-minute documentary of the CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train. I got to sit and watch friends again, new footage I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and a few surprises I hadn&#8217;t expected. Hopefully now, people can understand what I did, and why I have so much difficulty trying to explain what it was like.<br />
And this is how my year begins &#8212; with a new sense of being, sense of future, and a desire to experience more that this world of ours has to offer. That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t do a lot this year. But that&#8217;s another email&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Assuming you&#8217;re not avoiding the media or living under a rather large rock, you&#8217;ve probably heard that the second chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy opened today.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I&#8217;ve already seen it.<br />
A few weeks ago (over a month, actually), the Famous Players Paramount Chinook theatre started selling tickets for opening night. First showing: 12:01am.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: That&#8217;s when we saw it.<br />
There were originally just three of us: Adrian, Tamara, and myself. But Jensenne caught wind, and wanted to tag along. The more, the merrier, I say! Besides, then I have more &#8220;normal&#8221; people to stand around so I don&#8217;t look like such a dork being surrounded by obsessed Tolkien fans. (Okay, yes, I was there at midnight for a movie &#8230; but it&#8217;s a good movie!)  And believe me, there were a number of them. They started lining up early. At noon.<br />
Yup, a full twelve hours before the movie started. Why? Good question &#8212; I&#8217;m sure their lives can&#8217;t be so empty of fulfillment that 12 hours is nothing to them. Mind you, Star Wars fans tend more to the obsessive side. Both Tolkien and Star Wars fans are geeky &#8212; can&#8217;t avoid that one. They get really wrapped up in the story, the characters, the ethos of the whole thing. But there are differences between the two. Tolkien fans dress up as characters. Star Wars fans are the characters.<br />
Then there&#8217;s Trekkies. Let&#8217;s not go there.<br />
John was the first person in our group to arrive on the scene, and mostly by accident. He was in the theatre for another reason, and happened to notice &#8212; at 6:00pm &#8212; that the line was already underway. Due to the fortunes of modern technology, the line would form quickly. Our team would fall into place in line, myself being the last to arrive around 9:00pm. (There&#8217;s another whole story to that, but I&#8217;ll spare you the tangent.)<br />
There were noticeable people in the line. A couple were dressed up in costume. One carried a sign on a staff that read: &#8220;One sign to rule them all.&#8221; (Hey, I said Tolkien fans were reserved &#8212; I didn&#8217;t say they were any less geeky than the others.) The group sitting behind us brought &#8220;Lord of the Rings&#8221; Risk &#8212; until that time unopened. The drawback was that none of them had played before. By the time they&#8217;d gotten underway, we had to move the line again. The single best way to kill time in line was the guy who&#8217;d brought a laptop with a DVD player. I&#8217;ll give you three guesses what movie he played.<br />
And no, it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#8221;.<br />
The line formed quickly. Within an hour of my arrival, we&#8217;d already had to shuffle the line twice to prevent blocking other doors. By 10:00, there were so many people in line, we couldn&#8217;t sit down anymore. Sardines have more room. People had to get creative with ways to keep from going mildly mental standing in the line. Tamara got smart and brought playing cards a Nintendo Gameboy. Which, in retrospect, was her downfall&#8230;<br />
A-Channel (a local independent television station) sent out a camera crew to get footage of the freaks in line. Tamara laughed about this, mocking the few at the front who would likely stand out the most. So imagine her surprise, and our amusement, when an A-Channel camera peered over her shoulder as she played Tetris, then thrust a microphone in her face to ask her a question about how she had prepared to stand in line. There&#8217;s nothing like actually seeing the look of &#8220;Please God, not me&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Twenty minutes, and we were in the theatre. After standing for well over an hour, it was good to sit down again. Snacks, a quick run through the washroom, and it was magic time&#8230;<br />
A little over three hours later, we filtered out of the screening (some of us making fast dashes for the washrooms) and headed off into the quiet Wednesday morning. We made a fairly hasty return home. I had to be at work this morning, as per usual. Three hours&#8217; sleep really doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. Good thing work is slow right now.<br />
Yes, you&#8217;ve guessed right: I fell asleep at work.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A few weeks ago, I came to the conclusion that I could no longer stall. I had put it off for years, and it wasn&#8217;t really helping me. In fact, my apathy about the entire situation was appalling. To move ahead in such a fashion was foolish, to say the least, and would almost certainly hamper my future.<br />
It was time to buy another computer.<br />
For the last six-odd years, I&#8217;ve been working on an inferior Gateway P133 laptop. It&#8217;s old, heavy, the screen is slowly going, and the CD-ROM drive has been nothing but a nuisance for a very long time. And well, it&#8217;s old, slow, and not really suitable for the things I want to do with a computer. (That includes Internet access, running web servers, using more recent operating systems, and yes, playing video games.)<br />
I looked at Apple, long and hard. I&#8217;ve spent most of my computing life (about 99% of it) on PCs of one form or another. The PC arms race is beyond irritating, and the idea of constantly supporting them really didn&#8217;t sit well with me. Macs are much simpler, I can still do most of my job on them, and that new iMac was worth drooling over (especially the one with the wide screen).<br />
But after much information gathering, not to mention a fair bit of soul searching, I had to come to the conclusion that I would have to purchase a PC. Not my most favourite of conclusions. But at least it was a direction. Now for a vendor.<br />
My initial thought was Dell. I&#8217;d had a bad experience with Gateway 2000 some time ago, so I wasn&#8217;t really too keen on mail-order computers (or Internet-order, for that matter). But Dell has an impressive track record, and I have yet to hear a really disparaging comment about their systems. Besides, the laptop I used when I was with the CBC (software notwithstanding) was so impressive, that their desktop computers can&#8217;t all be bad.<br />
I searched, I priced, and I bought: Pentium 4 2.4GHz system with 512 MB RAM, an 80 GB hard drive, a 48x CD-ROM drive, a 4x DVD-R/CD-RW drive, IEEE 1394 ports, Turtle Beach sound card, an nVidia GeForce4 MX video card, a 17&#8243; LCD flat panel display, and some really nice speakers. No, it wasn&#8217;t cheap (the monitor really jacked up the price), but it was worth it.<br />
Almost.<br />
I had no Internet. When you live and breathe hypertext transfer protocol, you really do need a constant connection. And I ain&#8217;t talkin&#8217; about the measly 56k modem installed in the computer. I mean ASDL or Cable access. 24/7. All the information I could ever want, whenever I wanted it. Problem: Tamara already had it.<br />
Well, okay, that&#8217;s not really a problem. But it meant that we needed another port. Shaw charges $10 a month for an extra port. That seems just a little silly to me, since it&#8217;s no skin off their backs. Especially when for $130, I can purchase a little router that will allow up to four computers from our house to surf the &#8216;net or communicate with each other. But first, to find a router.<br />
That took a little longer, but surprisingly enough, not too long. My first stop was at Memory Express &#8212; *the* place to find computer parts in Calgary. Sold out. For a week. Who&#8217;da thunk there&#8217;d be a run on routers at this time of the year? But the Memory Express staff is extremely helpful &#8212; they suggested I try Compusmart down the road.<br />
Compusmart is one of those stores I try to avoid: flashy, high-flallutin&#8217; (at least so far as computer stores go), and the salespeople tend to be a little pushy. But they had the router I wanted. Then I tried a little tactic &#8212; did they do price matching? Luckily for me, they did. I pointed the salesman to Memory Express&#8217; website. Same router, and now the same price.<br />
Back at home, I pulled the router out of its box and did something I don&#8217;t normally do: read the instructions. This was because I was about to seriously screw around with Tamara&#8217;s computer, and she wasn&#8217;t there for me to ask for permission. Whatever I was about to do, I wanted to make sure that I could restore my changes and not affect her one bit.<br />
I read the sheet carefully (it fold out to the approximate size of a city map), then went into Tamara&#8217;s room and plugged the router into the electrical socket, plugged the Internet feed from the modem into the router, Tamara&#8217;s computer into the router, and my computer into the router.<br />
It took more time for me to read the instructions than it did for me to start surfing the web. A few years ago, this would have been like pulling teeth. I honestly can&#8217;t believe it was this easy! Suddenly, Macs aren&#8217;t quite so appealing.<br />
So I&#8217;m finally going to be mildly productive at home. Basically, I can do my own work on my own terms, instead of having to go to to office to use a computer.<br />
Now I can just figure out how to telecommute&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On Tuesday (12 November 2002), the extended version of Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released on DVD. The standard theatrical release came out a few months ago, but this was the one I was waiting for &#8212; more material, worth the price I was going to pay.<br />
The bold idea, of course, was to really show this movie. In fact, it was about as good an excuse as any to hold the first true &#8220;Movie Night&#8221; in my house. Chris and I used to hold movie nights all the time in our apartment, but due to lack of time, space, furniture, and the fact that at times my home looked more like the aftermath of a F-5 tornado than a house pretty much kept large events at bay.<br />
Until now.<br />
This release was reason enough to drag out a considerable number of people to my home, sit down, and listen to the movie at a volume that would deafen most teenagers. The subwoofer was turned up so much the floor shook. I&#8217;m sure that if my windows didn&#8217;t have brass strip accents, they would have rattled. The room was dark, and everyone had goosepimples. It was great.<br />
We paused the movie a couple of times, one for the when Virgil&#8217;s pizza arrived, a second (much longer) time when our Chinese food arrived (it had been far too long since our last Chinese dinner), and one last time when the first disc ended.<br />
Yes, the &#8220;first&#8221; disc. The extended version is on four discs. No, the movie itself doesn&#8217;t extend across all four &#8212; just the first two. Why so long? Well, the movie itself is 208 minutes &#8212; that&#8217;s pretty long, even for a DVD. Tack on a small army of extra audio channels, and suddenly you&#8217;ve got too much information for one measly little DVD disc.<br />
So we took a slight break. I popped out the first disc, swapped in the second, and pressed play. And then I crossed my fingers.<br />
Why cross fingers? That&#8217;s to compensate for my rather bad luck. You see, I had the set still in the A&amp;B plastic bag, and sealed in its wrapper. I hadn&#8217;t opened it. I wanted to preserve it so that its first real viewing would be in front of my friends. Naturally, that meant that it wouldn&#8217;t work.<br />
Have I ever mentioned that Murphy is my best friend?<br />
At first, the disc took an inordinately long time to load. My first thought: this wasn&#8217;t loading. There, that was my problem! Oh well, my luck &#8230; the disc finished loading and the title came up on the display. Huh &#8212; how &#8217;bout that, no problem! Well&#8230; so I thought, until I heard:<br />
Them: &#8220;Geoff, you doofus! You put the first disc in!&#8221;<br />
Me: &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s the right one!&#8221; (I check the discs, just to make sure.)<br />
Them: &#8220;Then why is the first disc&#8217;s contents on-screen?&#8221;<br />
I scratched my head. The first disc was in the case. I popped the disc out. Disc Two.<br />
Me: &#8220;Ha! This is the second disc!&#8221;<br />
Them: &#8220;Ha! You should have checked your copy before inviting us over!&#8221;<br />
They had a point.<br />
It appears that A&amp;B received a batch of bad copies of the movie. Somehow, I should have expected this. In fact, I pretty much did. This is how much luck tends to go. But where there&#8217;s a will (or a great deal of stubbornness), there&#8217;s a way. A nearby Blockbuster also helps.<br />
Not surprisingly, their copies were all rented. Audrey, however, took charge, and asked if there were any copies &#8220;lying around&#8221; that we could rent. Nada. Audrey didn&#8217;t stop, and had them check other stores. One of the nearby Blockbusters had one copy remaining.<br />
A mere viewing of the movie wasn&#8217;t enough. No, we had to engage our own quest for the ring. Audrey, Adrian, Calvin, and myself braved the treacherous Fire Lights of the Tenth Road, the decaying Bridge of Bow, a hurried run past the edge of the Forest of Glass Towers, and onto the hedonistic Avenue of Drunken Morons, finally arriving at the Blockbuster of Mount Doom, er, Royal. Obtaining our movie, we headed north on 14th Aisle of Laggan, before turning into the Hamlet of Kensington, and finally to Hobbiton, I mean, my house.<br />
Lights, DVD, action!<br />
We resumed our movie, revelling in the visual and aural bombardment. The cats wisely stayed out of the living room. The movie finally ended at half-past midnight, a full hour and a half after it should have.<br />
But such is the nature of a quest &#8212; you never know when it will truly end.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It doesn&#8217;t take long for me to get back into the swing of (some) things. I&#8217;m already working on trains again. This time, it&#8217;s the locomotive from which I caught the train chasing bug.<br />
I got a call from Don on Saturday, wanting the tapes I shot for 6060&#8217;s trip out to Jasper last year (see [[The Great Jasper Run, CN 6060 Stettler, Red Deer, Edmonton, Hinton, Jasper]]). We chatted briefly, then mentioned that I should drop by the roundhouse at CP&#8217;s Alyth Yard to see 2816 all steamed up. Asking if the engine were heading back to Vancouver for a six-month inspection or more work, Don replied that 2816 was making a run from Calgary to Banff and back with some of CP&#8217;s executives. I was to drop by around 11:00am on Sunday.<br />
When I arrived, Don&#8217;s truck was nowhere in sight. Having never been here before, and coming at Don&#8217;s invitation &#8212; not CP&#8217;s &#8212; I was careful to wait for my escort. Don arrived shortly afterwards, and I followed him in.<br />
2816 was not out in the yard, or even on the turntable (as I&#8217;d hoped). It was tucked inside, the smokebox cover completely removed, the superheater covers removed, and four men milling around inside. Present were Bill (2816&#8217;s lead engineer), Jim (CP employee, RMRS member, and steam locomotive engineer &#8212; Jim had run 6060 to Jasper with us last year), Al Broadfoot (who supervised 2816&#8217;s overhaul), and another man who I&#8217;d never met before.<br />
It seemed that the night before, after Don had left, Bill noticed an odd noise in the smokebox. Upon investigation, he found steam eminating from one of the flue tubes. That could mean only one thing &#8212; a superheater had burst.<br />
We had arrived to find them in the midst of removing superheater tubes. Luckily, they knew exactly which one was giving them trouble, but it was tucked behind a couple of other tubes that needed to be removed first. This involved using an overhead crane for support, and a forklift for leverage. Superheater tubes, especially in larger locomotives, are extremely heavy. Removing them by hand is torture (or so I&#8217;m told by the 6060 crew, who had to do just that).<br />
I didn&#8217;t directly participate. Partly because Bill and Al don&#8217;t know me, but also because I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. I&#8217;ve never seen this done before, let alone participated. I fell into my role of gopher. (Which I&#8217;m quite comfortable at, especially with people who know a lot more than I do.) That basically meant a coffee run.)<br />
While all this was happening, I had long chats with Al. It would appear that my education of Al has been woefully one-sided. I&#8217;ve heard lots of stories and some generally not nice things about him. I&#8217;d always been a little skeptical &#8230; but not enough. Al seems to be a genuinely honest man, trying to keep locomotives in good running shape. This is what I gathered talking to him directly. He actually mourned the RMRS&#8217; lack of a proper shop to maintain 6060. (This is something everyone agrees with.) Needless to say, if for nothing else, I&#8217;m glad I went just so I could talk with Al.<br />
The troubled superheater soon slid out of the boiler. As it popped out and was slowly lowered to the ground, water seeped from the bend. Etched in the forged piece was a tiny hole, about 1/16th of an inch across. Possibly a thin-walled area, aggravated by a grape (a weld that has pooled into a sphere on the inside) causing an eddy, bored right through the side.<br />
Normally, this would sideline a locomotive. But with CP&#8217;s resources, it&#8217;s a matter of cutting off the offending piece and getting in a welder to attach a new bend. Jim knew a good one in town who could come the following day to fix it.<br />
We left 2816 in the roundhouse, covers off, superheaters laid out, awaiting repairs. It almost looked like a patient anxiously awaiting a dentist to fill a cavity. It&#8217;s due to run to Banff (Bamf!) on Friday. I&#8217;m pretty sure it will.</p>

		<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ll have to excuse me,<br />
I&#8217;m not at my best.<br />
I&#8217;ve been gone for a month,<br />
I&#8217;ve been drunk since I left.<br />
These so-called vacations<br />
will soon be my death.<br />
I&#8217;m so sick from the drink,<br />
I need home for a rest.<br />
<cite>&#8212; &#8220;Home For A Rest&#8221;, Spirit of the West</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I arrived in Calgary last night at 8:30pm. It was dark, cold, dry, and I was harbouring my second illness in a month. The snow that fell here only days ago was gone (thankfully &#8212; I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m ready for that yet). But it already felt like home.<br />
My house was full again, the shipment of furnishings from my mom&#8217;s house having arrived during my absence. (Thank goodness for roommates.) The cats were cranky, but they&#8217;ve been that way since Spaz arrived. I&#8217;m doing something about that tonight. I walked into my room, tasted the smell of used kitty litter, and flopped down on my bed &#8212; the cloud of dust it kicked up had me coughing for a few minutes. But it felt like home.<br />
My last week in Halifax had been eventful, even when all I did was watch the Queen&#8217;s Gala on CBC. I took another train (no, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised). I saw Halifax, Lunenburg, Peggy&#8217;s Cove, and the Bay of Fundy. I crossed Cape Breton twice. I met more amazing people. I bought seafood and travelled to Huntsville for a family Thanksgiving. (My apologies to those of you in Toronto &#8212; it was a last-minute decision, and I didn&#8217;t venture any further south than gate B20 of Terminal 3.) As I sat in the plane last night, taxiing down the runway, I couldn&#8217;t wait to get home.<br />
This morning, it was minus two degrees outside. The leaves that were green when I left are now gone, dropped to the ground and neatly packed away in the garage (see previous comment about roommates). The walk to work seemed completely new, yet totally familiar (as it should be). My legs hurt from the walking. You&#8217;d think after a month of wandering around I wouldn&#8217;t notice.<br />
The office hasn&#8217;t changed much. A couple new faces, others on their way out &#8212; nothing out of the ordinary. My project hasn&#8217;t moved forward one iota. I joked with a colleague that I was going to leave a sealed envelope with a message that read: &#8220;Nothing will change while I&#8217;m gone.&#8221; Our laughter was nervous, because we both know the truth.<br />
Flipping on my computer, I was greeted with a cacophony of error messages. It seems my nicely drafted message to keep dirty paws off my computer hadn&#8217;t helped. The IT department felt it necessary to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; my computer in my absence, leaving me with a broken computer to return to. No email for me to start the day.<br />
The calendar might say &#8220;Tuesday&#8221;, but it feels like a Monday.<br />
Meetings at 10:00, lunch at 11:30, fires burning by 1:00. Three projects that are in dire straits already need my attention. I don&#8217;t even know what the hell&#8217;s been going on for the last month! So goes the story around here: Sink or Swim.<br />
Every person asks the same question: How was the trip? I give the token answer: Awesome! Great! Stupendous! Life-altering experience! But none of the answers come close to what I really want to say: You will never understand until you&#8217;ve done it yourself. I don&#8217;t want to let people down like that. I can show them all the 80 pages of journal entries and the over 2,500 pictures I took. But it doesn&#8217;t get the same feeling, the same idea. Everyone wants to see the documentary. I tell them one might be coming, but I haven&#8217;t heard for sure. Most seem to want to see a five episode series that covers every aspect. I can only hope.<br />
Email is restored through a borrowed laptop. It&#8217;s quirky to say the least, and half the functionality I need is missing. But I can at least try to figure out what few things have transpired in the last 45 days. It&#8217;s only 765 messages (a record low for the period of time), but a lot of people knew I wouldn&#8217;t be answering. Most are CCs or bulk TO lines. And spam. Drat.<br />
The cold is worsening. Throat&#8217;s killing me. Mint tea helps, but barely. I&#8217;m thinking tracheotomy. Head spins (or the room, still not sure which), blood drains from my face, and I resist the urge to sneeze for fear my throat might explode. Why couldn&#8217;t I just get the same cold I had on the train? That one was manageable.<br />
Despite the harsh weather, the harsh illness, and the harsh reality of being home again, I can honestly say I&#8217;m happy. I&#8217;m happy that I had the opportunity and the honour of being with the CBC and celebrating 50 years of television. I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;ve found more people I can call friends.<br />
The adventure is finally over. For now, anyway. A little quiet time with the nose on the wheel will probably do me some good. If anything, it&#8217;ll make me appreciate the trip even more.<br />
The saying goes, the journey is half the fun of getting there. The trip was more than half of that fun. But a little should be reserved for getting home. Although perhaps not so much fun as it is comforting.<br />
Be it ever so humble (and cluttered, and smelly), there&#8217;s no place like home.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been on the road far too long.<br />
Last night was Thanksgiving dinner up at the cottage. Good food, family, friend (there was only one), and good times. Even better sleep, in my old bed (since co-opted for use in the loft).<br />
Mom and Cathy drove me down to the airport. We made a side trip to see a rather uninteresting antique dealer in Gravenhurst. Aside from that and a couple of bathroom breaks, we made Pearson in a fairly good time.<br />
We grabbed a late lunch at Swiss Chalet. I checked my luggage after eating, and we switched to the bar.<br />
Even though I was at the airport, boarding pass to Calgary in hand, I didn&#8217;t really feel like I was going anywhere. I was in a bar with my family, as I&#8217;ve been (a few too) many times this year.<br />
Mom and Cathy were soon off for Oakville, leaving me to wait for my flight. (We left early to beat the returning weekend traffic. We left perhaps a little too early.)<br />
I waited at gate B20 for about an hour, reading Wired. Nothing out of the ordinary (at least for me, lately). Even when WestJet staff started yelling for passengers (the microphone to the PA system wasn&#8217;t working), there was no rush. For me, it&#8217;s all routine.<br />
I think I&#8217;ve actually travelled too much this year.<br />
But as I boarded the plane and took my seat, a feeling of reserved relief crept upon me. I&#8217;m going home. My month and a half abroad is ending in a few short hours. Tonight I will sleep in my own bed in my own home. I will see my cats. (Tomorrow, I&#8217;ll have to go back to my job &#8212; hey, it can&#8217;t all be roses.)<br />
I&#8217;m tired. Take me home. Please.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I hate alarms. Especially when they go off while you&#8217;ve still got an hour of darkness left of the night. I had an early flight to Toronto, though, and wasn&#8217;t keen on missing it.<br />
I had packed the night before, so all I had to do was shave, shower, dress, and throw all my bags in the trunk of my rented car. Checking out was trivial, just the way I like it. Then it was off to the airport.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where either my unbelievably good sense of direction, or my unbelievable stupidity, shows through. Most normal people would ask where the airport is and how to get there. Not me. I decided I could find it based on the solitary sign I&#8217;d seen on the Highway 102/103 interchange yesterday. Oh, I should mention that it was still dark when I entered the highway, and the radio was calling for dense patches of fog &#8230; about 10 seconds before I ran into one myself.<br />
So I drove north. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was even going to the correct airport. (I didn&#8217;t know how many airports were in the Halifax area.) For a short time, I considered turning off to get directions. But something kept me going. I found my way to the airport, though. The correct one, at that!<br />
One of these days, this behaviour is going to get me into trouble. Big trouble.<br />
Checking in was fast, as was picking up the seafood feast I was bringing back to Ontario. Five lobster, two pounds of mussels, and a pound of scallops. And so help me, none of it cooked in butter. (Not counting sautéing the onions and garlic for the white wine sauce.) The box the seafood came in, however, needed to be taken on the plane. Along with my two carry-on bags. This was over my limit, and a bit of worry. Luckily, the plane was only about three-quarters full. The staff didn&#8217;t stop me.<br />
Toronto came quickly, and I was soon waiting in the baggage claim with my three carry-ons. My duffle bag was the first bag off. My knapsack was significantly later. As I exited baggage claim, my mother came in the main doors. Five minutes later mom, Cathy, and I were on our way north.<br />
I was goaded into coming back to Ontario for Thanksgiving. I wanted to go home to Calgary. I&#8217;ve been away for a month and a half, and I want adjustment time. But somewhere in the back of my mind, staying for a couple of days in Huntsville seemed like a good idea. I gave into pressure and decided to come in. However, I&#8217;ll probably only see the airport, the highway, and the cottage. I doubt I&#8217;ll see anything else, or anyone else.<br />
The ride north was uneventful, save for the Teeming Thousands who were similarly heading north. The traffic, according to Cathy, wasn&#8217;t too bad though. On long weekends during the summer, you simply just don&#8217;t go up on Saturday&#8217;s. It&#8217;s just shy of declaring insanity. When we hit the Highway 69/Highway 11 split, the traffic lightened. The rest of the trip wasn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
At Orillia, I convinced Cathy that we needed to stop for lunch. I hadn&#8217;t eaten a thing since leaving Halifax, and it was now 3:00pm according to my stomach. This meant, of course, a stop at Weber&#8217;s &#8212; an institution in this part of Ontario. Virtually everyone who&#8217;s driven this stretch of highway more than once has eaten at Weber&#8217;s. And for good reason: it&#8217;s fast, fresh, and good.<br />
We were in Huntsville about an hour later. After a quick stop for beer (I&#8217;m a picky drinker), we made the long trek out to the cottage. It&#8217;s a bit of a hike &#8212; a lot longer than I remembered from my last journey out here (see [[Visit to Ontario, Cottage in Huntsville, Thanksgiving Dinner, Algonquin Park]]). But the cottage was as I remembered it. The outside, anyway. Cathy and Craig (mostly Craig) have put in a huge amount of renovation. It&#8217;s not done yet, but one day it&#8217;s going to be the smartest-looking small cabin on Lake Vernon.<br />
Craig was already there, having been doing yard work for most of the day. Bear and Kylie (both dogs) raced out of the woods to greet us. Within minutes of being inside, I started to feel a little more relaxed. I still wanted to go home to Calgary, though. I guess all this travel has just left me feeling a little tired.<br />
The renovations were awesome. The kitchen was totally different, the floor all tiled, and the bathroom looked almost totally new. (Well,it practically is.) Still, some work was still needed, including the walls of the living room and dining room, and the downstairs. But one thing at a time.<br />
Dave arrived not long after, Chuckie (Dave&#8217;s dog) in tow. Anne and Rebecca arrived not long after. We chatted and made fun of each other until it was time to get cooking. Which was when the lobster pot finally got to a boil &#8212; after being on the burners for about three hours.<br />
Lobsters: about 10 minutes. Mussels: about 7 minutes. Scallops: about two minutes. Time to eat it all: about an hour and a half. But worth it, if for no other reason than it cleared out the memory of the scallops I had in Lunenburg. We had no room for dessert.<br />
The fun continued after dinner as we resumed making fun of each other. I didn&#8217;t participate as much, being quite tired from everything (and the alcohol not helping much). It was a good time, but I didn&#8217;t really feel all that relaxed. I still wanted to go home. Maybe tomorrow, I won&#8217;t feel so uptight.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of these days, I&#8217;m going to remember to stop booking things at the last minute. I wanted to go to Lunenburg. I wasn&#8217;t about to take a taxi &#8211; it&#8217;s a little far for that. A car was the only real solution I could think of. But finding a car wasn&#8217;t easy. Especially on the Friday of the Thanksgiving long weekend. I ended up with a compact car from Budget. Not the best deal, but it was a car.<br />
My first stop, however, wasn&#8217;t Lunenburg. It was Point Pleasant, at the tip of the Halifax peninsula. My goal was to find an anchor. According to the story I&#8217;d heard, it was an anchor from one of the ships destroyed in the Halifax explosion. The anchor, supposedly, had been thrown the three-odd miles to land in the park. I never found that anchor (it might just be a story), but there is an anchor from one of Canada&#8217;s long-decommissioned aircraft carriers.<br />
The park is also full of Halifax history, from the old battlements used during the 1700s to the rotting dugouts from WWII. One of the oddest things to see is Prince of Wales Tower. It&#8217;s not a tower per se (it looms more than it towers), and doesn&#8217;t even come close to meeting the surrounding tree height. It&#8217;s a squat little erection that looks almost like a giant&#8217;s footstool. Once upon a time, it had been support for the other British battlements around the Halifax harbour. It later became a depot magazine, which ironically is what saved the tower from being torn down.<br />
Leaving Halifax was a bit of a challenge. Although it was during the day, the traffic was such that movement was slow. Interestingly enough, a local CBC reporter tried to get my input on the problem while I was stopped at a light. She was quite frustrated to learn I was only a tourist. (I got the feeling she was having trouble getting the input she needed.)<br />
Soon I was on the highway heading south. I had no real idea of where I was going. I only knew that Lunenburg was about an hour south of Halifax. Luckily, there&#8217;s an invention called a road sign that readily provides information for drivers too stupid (or cheap) to buy a map.<br />
I ended up passing through Mahone Bay. This time, I took the road out of town that we&#8217;d avoided. A little over 10 kilometres down the road, the houses of historic Lunenburg soon lined the streets.<br />
Downtown Lunenburg is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The houses are kept in immaculate (original) condition, as are the museums and restaurants. There&#8217;s even a Subway restaurant that you&#8217;d miss if you weren&#8217;t looking. The ships sitting in the harbour, including the Bluenose II, only accent the feeling.<br />
My first stop was for lunch. Having yet again skipped breakfast, I needed to eat. I stopped at a place Daryl had recommended a while back. Although it looked like a good establishment, I was extremely disappointed with the meal. I&#8217;m sure that somewhere, someone likes vegetables boiled in butter. My stomach was flip-flopping the rest of the day.<br />
I visited the Fisheries Museum next. Built into what was probably a canning plant from the heyday of Lunenburg fishing, you&#8217;d almost never know what you were looking at, were it not for the signs. It&#8217;s a quaint little place that shows what it was like to fish on the east coast, equipment and all.<br />
On the waterfront are a pair of boats owned by the museum. One is the Cape Sable, a retired fishing vessel. I&#8217;ve seen &#8220;The Perfect Storm&#8221;, so I thought I had an idea of what a fishing ship looked like. But there is a certain reality when you look at the tiny compartments that these men lived in. The Captain&#8217;s room, though large, was little different than those of the other officers. The bed was the same as everyone else&#8217;s. The interior was almost enough to kill off any thoughts of ever living a life on the ocean.<br />
I held off seeing the best until the end &#8211; the Bluenose II. I remember little of the Bluenose. The last time I saw the ship, I was eight years old in Halifax. Although sealed for the winter, you could still make out the distinctive hull, the masts, and getting right up next to the ship, you could see the deck and its contents without trouble. But I would not board the Bluenose this visit. That will have to wait until my return to Nova Scotia.<br />
Before heading back towards Halifax, I rounded the bay so I could get a picture of Lunenburg with the town glowing in the sunlight. I was not disappointed, though I would have liked to have been a little higher up. You get what you can.<br />
My next stop was Peggy&#8217;s Cove. I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Hadn&#8217;t I already visited there? I had, but an idea crossed my mind that drew me back. One of the signs in the post office in the Peggy&#8217;s Cove lighthouse said that letters posted in either the lighthouse or the mailbox next to the gift shop would receive the Peggy&#8217;s Cove cancellation. At the time, it hadn&#8217;t really sunk in. The idea of sending a postcard to friends and family from Peggy&#8217;s Cove really appealed to me, and was the sole reason I went back.<br />
The good weather was welcome, though. As much as I like the pictures I took a week ago, the setting sun provided some wonderful angles and bright light, backing onto the blue sky. Even black and white pictures looked better.<br />
Returning to Halifax along Highway 333, I found my way directly to my hotel. I ditched the car in favour of walking downtown for dinner. Still trying to ditch the icky feeling from lunch, I opted for the cleanest food I know and love: sushi, at Hamachi House. A little green tea, a little tempura, and couple rolls of some of the freshest fish I&#8217;ve ever had.<br />
I sat at the sushi bar. The restaurant was quite full, with people all around the bar. But no-one I knew. I&#8217;ve gotten used to eating in restaurants on my own, but it doesn&#8217;t ease the loneliness. After being with people for the last month, travelling on my own left me feeling a little more empty than I like.<br />
Tomorrow, I begin my long journey home. That&#8217;s pretty much what&#8217;s keeping me going right now. I&#8217;m tired. Tired of the waiting, the pacing, the walking, the seeing, the doing. I never thought I&#8217;d hear myself say this, but I want to go back to a job that drives me crazy &#8211; at least it&#8217;s predictable.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sleeping in is good. Too bad I didn&#8217;t sleep in. Instead, I woke around 8:30 and began to get on with the day. The first order of business was typing out some of the journal entries I was behind on. The second was making the CD-ROM for Ken. The last was making arrangements to visit with a friend of a friend.<br />
The sky was overcast, but threatened no rain. In fact, the clouds were so thin that I had to wear sunglasses to cut down on the glare. I hiked down to the VIA station, where I dropped off the CD-ROM and a card for the Bras D&#8217;or crew. Then it was off to resume my tour of Halifax.<br />
I wandered down Lower Water Street, zipping in and out of various shops and courtyards. I wasn&#8217;t looking for anything in particular, but was curious to see what was there.<br />
Several of the wharves are no longer in active use, save for the odd tour boat. The rest are permanent (or semi-permanent) moorings for vessels of historical significance. Some are tied with the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, such as the CSS Acadia. There is also a permanent berth for the Bluenose II, even though the Bluenose itself was in Lunenburg for the winter.<br />
During my jaunt, I found Canada&#8217;s first and only mouth-blown crystal manufacturer, Nova Scotian Crystal. They keep their garage door open so people can peer inside to see the process at work. I could barely see with all the onlookers, and moved on.<br />
I ended up doubling back on my route, but going down Lower Water Street instead of along the boardwalk. I arrived back at Brewery Market, and thought I&#8217;d take another look inside. Although I wasn&#8217;t going to take the brewery tour again, there had been several shops that had been closed the last time I was there. With a sign that read &#8220;Maritime Handicrafts&#8221;, I decided a peek was in order.<br />
As I rounded the corner, what did my peering eyes spy, but a new friend: Stephanie. She had mentioned that she worked in a jewellery store the day before. This wasn&#8217;t exactly a jewellery store, but had some jewellery for sale. Not interested in such baubles, I concentrated on the handicrafts. We talked while she showed me the wares. But there wasn&#8217;t much there that I saw of interest.<br />
Instead of helping me buy something I didn&#8217;t want, Stephanie directed me to Spring Garden Road. She quietly said that there was more there for me to see, and I could also tackle my lunch problem. As a convenient bonus, I was also to meet my contact at the Second Cup on Spring Garden at 3:00 &#8211; a scant half hour away.<br />
There were many shops on Spring Garden, including Jennifer&#8217;s of Nova Scotia (the best gift shop I saw in Nova Scotia) and HMV (where I had to strongly resist the urge to buy something). Being almost time, I headed over to the Second Cup.<br />
I had never met Jiye before, nor had I even seen a picture. She&#8217;s a good friend of my good friend Kim. (Kim had asked that if time I allowed that I meet Jiye.) Luckily, it was easy to spot Jiye &#8211; she was the only young Chinese woman standing out in front looking for someone.<br />
I had loosely planned to spend only a half hour with Jiye. Not that I didn&#8217;t want to meet her, but I wanted to get to the Halifax Citadel before it closed at 5:00, and have enough time to actually see it. But we got so deeply engaged in conversation that time completely vanished. It was nearly 4:00 when we finally broke and parted ways.<br />
I hope Jiye does well in Halifax. She had moved there, following her PhD advisor, who had come to Dalhousie. She was finding the experience difficult, since she didn&#8217;t know the city, had no friends, and didn&#8217;t have much of a social life. As Jiye wasn&#8217;t enrolled at Dalhousie, she couldn&#8217;t take courses either, making meeting people difficult. I offered some advice, hoping that it might make her life on the east coast a little more bearable.<br />
Jiye returned to her apartment, and I headed up the hill to the Citadel. By the time I got there, I had barely 40 minutes of time until it closed. Deciding that a half-hour was better than no visit at all, I attempted to purchase a ticket. I say &#8220;attempted&#8221; because I wasn&#8217;t actually able to buy my way in &#8230; in the last half hour, the fee is waived. Who said there&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch?<br />
The Halifax Citadel isn&#8217;t as polished as La Citadelle in Quebec City. Where La Citadelle is immense, and made of smooth-faced granite blocks, the Halifax Citadel is mostly rough rectangular stones. The Citadel is no longer in active service, unlike Quebec City, so is preserved in its original state. It&#8217;s a neat place to visit.<br />
The museum portions of the Citadel are quite extensive. You could easily spend most of a day just wandering in and out of the honeycomb of rooms. With my general lack of time, I did what my sister and brother-and-law do in museums: Look and keep walking. I tried to speed-read certain things, but didn&#8217;t take in too much.<br />
A whistle in the courtyard announced the five-minute warning. I snapped pictures hurriedly, and scooted out the door as it was being locked behind me. More pictures of the outer walls and the moat, and then of the town clock, just down the hill from the Citadel. Then further down the hill to the waterfront again, where I started to plan my evening activities.<br />
One thing I wanted was a picture of Halifax at night from the other side of the harbour. That mean taking a ferry. The question was, which ferry to which port? There are two: one to Dartmouth and a second to Woodside. If I&#8217;d ever been on the other side of the harbour before, I couldn&#8217;t remember. The other thing I needed to do was eat. I still hadn&#8217;t had breakfast or lunch, and was getting a little peckish.<br />
My plan was: eat, take a ferry across to the other side, snap pictures, come back, and wind my way back to the hotel. Seemed like a simple plan. The key was in the timing. I had to wait until it was dark enough to get the full effect of the lights at night. It was too early to begin even dinner, so I took the opportunity to walk further down the boardwalk, past the casino, all the way to the naval base. (An American aircraft carrier was in port, and I was curious to see which one. I never did find out &#8211; the name appeared hidden.)<br />
About an hour later, I pulled into a small pub and grill on the boardwalk to satisfy my hunger. Mussels, salmon, and some bread did a satisfactory job. My waiter was extremely helpful in solving my other question &#8211; apparently Dartmouth offered a better view of downtown.<br />
The ferries that run across the harbour are small &#8211; about twice the size of the SeaBus in Vancouver, about half the size of the Toronto Harbour ferries. No vehicles (except bikes), and meant for commuters. The ferries have been running for 250 years. Originally, it was a teamboat &#8211; a ship propelled by a team of eight horses. Now it&#8217;s a small fleet of bi-directional diesel-powered vessels.<br />
The trip is short &#8211; only 10 minutes or so. But the waiter had been accurate &#8212; the view was spectacular. It was also much closer to the bridge, which I also wanted to get pictures of. I took up position at the end of a wharf, and took pictures until the next ferry arrived almost a half hour later.<br />
The trip back was better than the trip over. This time I faced Halifax. The buildings cast bright lights onto the harbour. The naval vessels glowed at their edges. And as a treat, we were passed by a half-full Hapag-Lloyd container ship. Then it was off around the downtown again, slowly winding my way back towards the hotel.<br />
When I&#8217;d parted company with the Bras D&#8217;or crew, I had taken a bit of a gamble and left my name and phone number with Stephanie. My hope was that she might call, even though my expectation was that she wouldn&#8217;t. Stephanie and Angela were fighting off a nasty cold both days on the train. Even when I&#8217;d found Stephanie earlier in the day, she&#8217;d reiterated the need to get rest. But ever the optimist, I thought I&#8217;d take a chance.<br />
That, and I was tired of wandering around. I wanted to sit down a while.<br />
I ended up watching the Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s visit to the CBC Broadcast Centre in Toronto (looking around the audience for people I knew), and then the Gala Celebration at Roy Thompson Hall. It was a beautiful show, and really showcased some of the best of Canadian talent. It made me feel inadequate about my artistic abilities, which are generally pretty lousy.<br />
I fell asleep with the TV on. Probably a good thing. I had a lot of driving ahead of me.</p>

		<p>It was still dark when the alarm clock (bolted to the night table) tuned in the local classic rock station. Great thing about radio &#8211; there&#8217;s always a classic rock station available.</p>
<p>Showered and bags packed, I hiked my way back to the train. It wasn&#8217;t too far, and with only two bags wasn&#8217;t a big deal. As I neared the train station (barely more than a plywood lean-to with a small painted sign that reads &#8220;Sydney&#8221;), I began to wonder if the train departed from the same station. I didn&#8217;t see anyone on the platform, so I couldn&#8217;t be sure.</p>
<p>Pressing on, I turned the corner and crossed the tracks. As I did, I could hear the bell of the locomotive as the train approached. A little more relieved, I then noticed some of the crew and passengers waiting on the platform. I felt much more relieved. The train and I arrived at the same time.</p>
<p>Ken was there to greet us as we boarded. Lisa, Joanne, and Desmond were elsewhere on board, no doubt preparing for the day&#8217;s events. There was no sign of either Angela or Stephanie at first, but I had little doubt they&#8217;d miss the trip.</p>
<p>As the staff passed by, I bade them each a good morning, which they returned. Only unlike most of the other passengers, they used my name. I felt for a while like I was home again, with friends who know who knew me.</p>
<p>The train left on time, and began to retrace the route from yesterday. Breakfast soon appeared, and just as soon disappeared. Once the tray was gone, I began wandering again. I passed by the rail fan who Ken had been wary of the day before. He cast me a look that wasn&#8217;t quite dirty, but certainly wasn&#8217;t hospitable. (Ken would later sternly instruct the man that he was to remain seated while in the domes &#8211; he was regularly standing at the top of the staircase, blocking not only entry and exit, but also the view from other passengers.)</p>
<p>I returned to the coffee shop, where the staff was beginning to congregate again. Conversations resumed as we watched the scenery go by. Lisa had brought snacks: her mother&#8217;s cherry poundcake (absolutely luscious) and cookies called &#8220;fat archies&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never had a fat archie before. Lisa calls it a &#8220;molasses raisin cookie&#8221;. It has a healthy dose of cinnamon, and is almost like eating a small cake. I&#8217;m not a big fan of raisin cookies, but I could eat a whole tin of fat archies. Wow.</p>
<p>Lisa&#8217;s parents were also along for the ride. They were just like the rest of the Bras D&#8217;or crew &#8211; extremely friendly and very hospitable. Must be a Cape Breton thing. Lisa&#8217;s mom would later sing along with Stephanie, Angela, and Lisa, and her father would play his keyboard during the jam session in the coffee shop later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our first stop was in Orangedale. Again, the passengers disembarked, looked around, and listened as Stephanie, Angela, Lisa, and Lisa&#8217;s mom sang some of the traditional songs of Cape Breton.</p>
<p>Back on the train, we headed to Port Hawkesbury. The scenery was stunning. Although mostly cloudy, the sun managed to peek through enough to make everything seem somehow more magical. Hawks and bald eagles flew alongside the train, swooping and diving in some aerial ballet, playing with the sunbeams that pocked regularly through the clouds.</p>
<p>Not everyone climbed out at Port Hawkesbury. I suspect those who didn&#8217;t had been there the day before, and saw nothing to see again. I climbed out, but really only for one purpose: take a picture of the crew. Yesterday, Ken had asked me to take pictures of the scenery for him. I figured he also needed a picture of the crew. Especially if this is to be the last crew of the Bras D&#8217;or.</p>
<p>Shortly after crossing the Canso Causeway, we received lunch. Chicken for me, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for the seafood trio I&#8217;d had the day before. And only one cup of wine this time &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to be stumbling around the train. The meal, the wine, and the light rocking of the train soon did me in, and I was out. I woke as we started passing through Antigonish.</p>
<p>Returning again to the coffee shop, I found only a couple people present. The rest were off tending to duties. I chatted with Angela. I was curious to see what I was missing in the tour. This was the job Angela used to fulfill, before VIA installed the automated system. Angela shrugged and replied: &#8220;Not much&#8221;, saying the only thing the automated system didn&#8217;t include were the stories.</p>
<p>The second music session began a few minutes later in the Laurentide Park car. It was almost reminiscent of the jam session we&#8217;d had on the CBC train coming out of Edmonton. Just not as raucous. (I was still the youngest person on board, although there were a few more younger people.) I sat in the last seat of the dome, and listened from above. I think I recognised two songs the entire session. All beautiful, but few familiar.</p>
<p>When the group broke up, I headed to the Skyline lounge to watch the passing countryside. (The rail fan was back at the top of the stairs again. I opted not to say anything.) As I peered out the window, Angela came by and sat down for a moment. She asked if I were bored. This had to be the most surprising question I&#8217;d been asked since I left Calgary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would I be bored?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you saw the same thing yesterday, only in reverse. What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221; Angela returned.</p>
<p>She had a good point &#8211; I had seen (more or less) the same thing the day before. But there were a few things that she hadn&#8217;t considered. Angela rides the train for five months a year, twice a week (once in each direction). So immediately, that makes the trip a little dull for her. I&#8217;ve never seen any of it before. I had also made a point of getting to know the staff. Not because it would be advantageous to me (though it most certainly was), but because then I&#8217;d have someone to talk to, and hopefully meet new friends. Good conversation, carefree play, and good jokes make even 10 hour trips disappear.</p>
<p>Shortly after Truro came the jam session. As many people as could squeeze into the coffee shop grouped around Stephanie, Angela, and Lisa&#8217;s father. For the next hour and a half, they played whatever songs came to mind, including &#8220;American Pie&#8221; and what almost seems to be the theme song of Nova Scotia, &#8220;Barrett&#8217;s Privateers&#8221; (I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times I&#8217;ve heard the song since arriving.)</p>
<p>In the last hour, souvenirs came out for sale, and the staff began to pack up things no longer in use. Before long, Bedford Basin came into view. Everything was being packed away. Ken even commented on packing things away in his &#8220;tickle trunk&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure if he said that for my benefit or not.</p>
<p>The last vestiges of the CBC train were gone. Skyline 8502, Banff Park, the museum cars, the baggage car, and the coach car had still been in the station yesterday. (Locomotive #6403 and the generator car had left by then.) The only thing left of the trip in Halifax was me.</p>
<p>I was sad to leave the train. I had made new friends, who had treated me exceptionally well. I bade them all farewell, and promised to drop off a CD-ROM of the pictures I took to the VIA office the following day.</p>
<p>In lieu of a taxi, I hiked back to the hotel. I found this not only good exercise, but a great way to prevent aggravation. Getting a taxi at the train station is almost like waiting for Godot.</p>
<p>Exhausted from my trip, I&#8217;m staying in tonight, and ordering room service (it was a small pizza, nothing fancy). And laundry. (When you run out of clean underwear, it&#8217;s laundry time.)</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Waking early after a few days of sleeping in (even if just a little) was difficult. But given the day&#8217;s activity, I couldn&#8217;t wait. I was taking a train.<br />
Yes, a train. A month on the CBC special hadn&#8217;t dampened my spirit one bit. And the free coupon one of the VIA product managers had arranged for me gave me the perfect opportunity to ride more trains. (If I could, I&#8217;d probably take the train back to Calgary.)<br />
The Bras D&#8217;or (in English, &#8220;Golden Arm&#8221;) is a rail cruise VIA runs from Halifax to Sydney in Cape Breton. It&#8217;s a 10 hour ride, arriving in the early evening. You spend the whole day on the train, save for one scheduled stop at Port Hawkesbury.<br />
I was the youngest person in the waiting room. A seniors tour was on the train, as were several other couples travelling on their own. There were two or three others, not counting myself, who didn&#8217;t have grey hair. But that was fine with me.<br />
This was the first train I would board where I didn&#8217;t know anyone &#8211; not the crew, not the passengers. It was a peculiar feeling. No more unsettling than how the interior mirrored the CBC train. The coach cars had extremely similar layouts, but none of the clutter. The Skyline car (#8505) was a spitting image of the one we&#8217;d had (#8502), except for the TV in the coffee shop. The Laurentide Park is a bare six digits in serial numbers from the Banff Park &#8230; the only visible difference is the painting in the Mural Lounge. It almost felt like home.<br />
Breakfast, in the form of fresh fruit and a small bowl of cereal, came not long after departure. We rounded the Bedford Basin and began our trip out to Truro. From there, we&#8217;d go through Stellarton, New Glasgow, Antigonish, before arriving at the Canso Causeway. We&#8217;d cross into Cape Breton and pause for a while at Port Hawkesbury. Then north(ish) through Cape Breton to North Sydney, Sydney Mines, and then into Sydney itself.<br />
I started wandering about not long after the empty breakfast tray was taken away. I found the dome cars in marginal condition &#8211; the glass was either blurred or contained many small cracks. The windows are a decade old, and are in need of replacement. The scenery is no less beautiful, just difficult to take pictures of through the windows.<br />
I ended up in the coffee shop of the Skyline car, where the windows are large, very clean, and defect-free. Not a perfect place to take pictures, but there was an added benefit &#8211; this was where the crew sat when not doing rounds. They recognized my CBC vest. They asked if I had been on the CBC special.<br />
The next few hours passed quickly as I slowly got to know the crew. There was the Service Manager, Ken, and his staff Lisa, Joanne, and Desmond. (Desmond is also a service manager, but wanted the quieter trip of the Bras D&#8217;or, and takes a seat behind Ken, who has more seniority.) But that&#8217;s not the entire crew &#8211; two of Cape Breton&#8217;s finest represent Cape Breton Tourism on board, Angela and Stephanie.<br />
By the time lunch had rolled around, I had gotten to know some of the staff; listened as Stephanie, Angela, and Lisa tried to write down the lyrics to &#8220;Coal Town Road&#8221;, a traditional Cape Breton tune; and been offered a rail fan&#8217;s dream. While Ken and I discussed some of the finer points of rail travel, he leaned in, grinned, and asked if I&#8217;d like to see the cab. I thought he meant while we were stopped. He meant while we were running.<br />
Amongst rail fans, a cab ride is like winning an Oscar. It&#8217;s an award bestowed by your peers, and an honour to be treasured. Mostly because the official route in getting a cab ride is long, convoluted, and extremely difficult. (We found this out on the CBC train when we tried to get Daryl into the cab to shoot video.) I did my best to agree eagerly, without looking too eager.<br />
This was kept very hushed, because there was a problem with Ken letting me go in the cab. And it wasn&#8217;t the engineers &#8211; it was another rail fan. Another man on board, from the Hillsborough and Salem Railroad, is what rail fans describe as a &#8220;foamer&#8221; &#8211; someone who foams at the mouth when talking about trains. They&#8217;re a little too fanatic to trust entirely. This guy had been pestering Ken since the trip started to go in the cab, but there was no way Ken was letting him in the cab. I guess I was calm and patient enough to be deemed &#8220;safe&#8221;. The trick was getting me in the engine without anyone seeing me.<br />
But I would wait until after lunch, which was served just out of Antigonish. It was wonderful to just sit and watch the countryside go by. The explosion of colours were already visible in the vast forests. The most fantastic reds, fresh greens, and bold yellows I&#8217;ve ever seen. We&#8217;re only in the early stages of fall here in Nova Scotia &#8211; I can only imagine what it will look like in a week or two.<br />
Lunch was cold, but no less delicious. I&#8217;d never had cold scallops before. A little chewy perhaps, but still tasty. It even came with a selection of local wines from the Jost Vineyards. (I have to say that while I did end up having both the white and the red, neither rated particularly high with me. I thought we&#8217;d have to rotate through the Skyline coffee shop, as we&#8217;d done with the CBC, but the staff delivered it to our seats.<br />
The Canso Causeway was built in the 1950s to join Cape Breton Island with Nova Scotia. It&#8217;s was a huge project. Due to the depth of the chasm, no bridge would work. Instead, rocks fill the massive gap allowing for a highway and a rail crossing. A small canal allows transit from one side to the other through locks. The locks don&#8217;t control water levels, just ensure that the current is controlled.<br />
Port Hawkesbury isn&#8217;t really much of a stop. But it&#8217;s necessary to change out crews. The rail line runs on CN to Truro, then on CB&amp;CNS north to Sydney. The Cape Breton crew comes on at Port Hawkesbury. That means a half hour for us to wander around and do very little.<br />
Actually, it&#8217;s supposed to be an hour. But Port Hawkesbury isn&#8217;t exactly a riveting location. That&#8217;s why the stop is only 30 minutes. The rest of the stop comes a few miles down the line at Orangedale.<br />
Orangedale is a small community, but somehow has ended up with the best rail museum in Nova Scotia. It&#8217;s not large by any means, but has preserved the station building in its original state, and has several pieces of rolling stock on their grounds.<br />
But that&#8217;s not all. As part of our stop, we get a mini-concert. When the Bras D&#8217;or originally started three years ago, Cape Breton Tourism staff would act as tour guides, pointing out interesting features and telling stories. Today, the system is mostly automated. According to Angela, it does a pretty good job. As a result, Stephanie and Angela&#8217;s jobs are somewhat reduced.<br />
One of their jobs is to sing traditional songs from Cape Breton and Nova Scotia. Stephanie is an accomplished guitarist, and sings like an angel. (Stephanie is moving to Toronto in October. Music industry, please take note!) I couldn&#8217;t help but stop and listen for a time. Even when I wasn&#8217;t in the station house, you could hear her voice clearly.<br />
Resuming our trip, Ken pulled me aside and asked me to hide for a few minutes in the kitchen. That&#8217;s when Howie appeared. Howie was one of the two engineers, and had come down to get snacks and coffee for him and Everett, the other engineer. The two of them led me through the coach cars, and through the baggage car (it&#8217;s quite odd to see one of those empty). At this point, I put in my earplugs, and followed Howie into the engine room of #6409, the train&#8217;s sole locomotive.<br />
The last time I&#8217;d been inside an engine room was with Peter in Melville. It had been loud then, and the engine was idling. Now it was under load. Howie had been through there so many times it probably didn&#8217;t faze him at all. I was glad to have earplugs. We emerged into the cab, where Everett met me with a big smile. Howie immediately offered me his seat on the left side &#8211; Howie sat in a fold-down seat mounted to the rear wall.<br />
Riding in a cab really brings the idea of an &#8220;iron horse&#8221; to reality. The ride is not smooth (especially on rough track), and even with shock-absorbed seats, I nearly flew out of my chair more than once. Howie and Everett didn&#8217;t seem to have any trouble at all. (Of course, they make regular runs on this stretch of the CB&amp;CNS and know every little detail. While I was missing the tour on the train, I was receiving my own personal version from the engineers.)<br />
The scenery around Bras D&#8217;or Lake is almost indescribable. I&#8217;ve never seen anything quite like it. Reminiscent of the west coast, northern Ontario, Lake Ontario, and Scotland all rolled into one. (I&#8217;m going on assumptions of Scotland, mind you. I haven&#8217;t been there, but I have seen many pictures and video.) And with the fall colours beginning to take hold, it&#8217;s a gorgeous place to witness first hand.<br />
Which made my trip all the more poignant. Little did I know when I boarded the train this morning that the Bras D&#8217;or might be meeting the same fate as BC Rail&#8217;s Cariboo Prospector. CB&amp;CNS wants to abandon the line north of Port Hawkesbury, due to lack of income (most of the mines on Cape Breton have closed) and maintenance. Right now, there are two freight trains and one passenger train a week.<br />
That would mean that next week could be the final run of the Bras D&#8217;or, through some of the most beautiful landscape I&#8217;ve seen. It&#8217;s a terrible shame, since to follow the same route of the Bras D&#8217;or is quite a challenge in a car. Roads don&#8217;t come event remotely close to some parts of the track. While a highway does follow the west bank of Bras D&#8217;or Lake, I doubt the view is the same.<br />
The abandonment is not yet certain, but is expected. This has left the Bras D&#8217;or&#8217;s crew with a lot of questions. They work together extremely well, and would want to continue the trend next year. However, there&#8217;s no way to know if the train will even run next spring. So until official word comes, they must wait.<br />
The residents of this area are also saddened with the news. It&#8217;s the only place where I&#8217;ve seen signs that read: &#8220;Welcome VIA&#8221;, sitting on the side of the railway. An elderly man in North Sydney even came to see the train pass, holding a sign that said: &#8220;Best Wishes VIA. We will miss you!&#8221;<br />
As we passed Sydney Mines, it was time for me to leave the cab. We didn&#8217;t want the other rail fan to see me leave the engine in Sydney. I didn&#8217;t quite make it back into the coach cars, though. I ended up spending some time in the near-empty baggage car talking with the VIA staff as they took a final break before arriving at the station.<br />
I could have walked to my hotel. But I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure where it was, nor was I too keen on carrying my bags that far right away. I opted for the five dollar, four minute cab ride. But I was checked into my room and sitting in the bed a scant 10 minutes after detraining. A record since I started riding trains a month ago.<br />
Sydney is an industrial town. In other words, there&#8217;s not much in it for nightlife. (Even the Bras D&#8217;or crew admitted to that.) But I wasn&#8217;t really interested in doing much anyway. All I wanted were a few pictures, a good meal, and a good night&#8217;s sleep.<br />
A fairly lengthy hike brought me down to the harbour area. That&#8217;s where Sydney has a fairly extensive boardwalk along the edge of the harbour, running for about a kilometre or so. A pretty good location for getting pictures of the city at dusk. A little further down were more hotels, the Royal Cape Breton Yacht Club, and an office building or two. I stopped into the Crow and Moose in the Delta Hotel for what were supposed to be the best fish and chips in the area. I couldn&#8217;t complain.<br />
Sydney has one of only two casinos in Nova Scotia. You&#8217;d think it would be clearly marked on signs and easy to find. I looked briefly, then decided that it wasn&#8217;t worth my time. My lucky streaks seem to tend towards life experiences, not money. Knowing my luck, I&#8217;d probably lose my shirt the moment I entered the door.<br />
Returning to the hotel, I curled up for a good night&#8217;s sleep. It would be another early morning.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Sleeping in is one of those little pleasures of life that I&#8217;ve been ignoring for far too long. The fact that I was still exhausted from yesterday made passing through my alarm even easier.<br />
I skipped breakfast. I was in serious need to finish my journal entries. My contract with CBC expired last night, and it was necessary for me to complete the deal. I wrote and edited until after noon, then disappeared to the bar downstairs to upload all the content. Finishing around 1:30, it was time to resume my tour of Halifax.<br />
Naturally, it was raining.<br />
Actually, I knew it would rain (the forecast had been heralding rain for days). I planned my tours to include Pier 21, the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, and the Alexander Keith&#8217;s Brewery tour. All indoors &#8230; except for the distances in between.<br />
Pier 21 sits between the Halifax railway station and the harbour. (Back in the day, they were connected by track so the Intercolonial Railway could whisk away newcomers to distant corners of Canada.) A short taxi ride kept me relatively dry.<br />
Pier 21 was one of the many immigration entry points into Canada. It serviced incoming passenger ships that crossed the Atlantic from 1920 until 1971, when its last landed immigrant passed through its doors. In 1999, with grants and assistance from companies and donations, it reopened as a museum to those who worked at the facility, and all those who passed through its doors.<br />
The museum is sparsely furnished and yet conveys the confusion, process, and lives that existed within the walls. Exhibits tell stories from those who worked or passed through Pier 21, offer artefacts that illustrate the periods of time, and let visitors experience the caged feelings new arrivals must have felt.<br />
Perhaps the single best story is that told in &#8220;Oceans of Hope&#8221;. It&#8217;s a &#8220;four dimensional&#8221; multimedia presentation that incorporates slides, movies, audio, and a series of translucent screens that create a multi-dimensional view. The presentation of the medium is one thing, but the story it tells is something else.<br />
Just shy of one million people passed through Pier 21, all receiving the much-desired &#8220;Landed Immigrant&#8221; stamp. It is impossible to tell all those stories, so those presented are conglomerations of them. The original immigrants, the soldiers who passed through during WWII, the war brides and their children, the Jewish orphans, all linked by the narrator, a fictional immigration officer.<br />
The story is moving. And the projection method makes the people seem not only real, but also like ghosts. It seems as if the walls are telling the stories that it has seen for over three-quarters of a century. The presentation, in concert with the rest of the museum, makes you feel a little different about being Canadian. Not necessarily proud, but privileged. As a Canadian writer (and immigrant) wrote: &#8220;A Canadian is an immigrant with seniority.&#8221;<br />
One of the more interesting exhibits is the Canadian National Train. It&#8217;s a larger-than-reality mock-up of a passenger car, where you can experience a trip across Canada. In five minutes. The trip runs from Halifax to Vancouver &#8211; it&#8217;s a video filmed several years ago (the equipment you see are VIA Blue cars, not seen in transcontinental service for almost a decade, and it runs through Swift Current, which is CPR territory). Having just finished the trip myself, in the opposite direction, it&#8217;s an interesting perspective.<br />
I took another taxi to the Maritime Museum. The rain would have soaked me to the bone, and I was without umbrella. As it stands, I was better off taking the taxi regardless &#8211; I arrived with five minutes to spare before the Titanic 3-D movie, and the extra time allowed me extra time to look around.<br />
The movie was filmed at the same time as the IMAX&#8217; Titanica, but using different equipment and crews. The film doesn&#8217;t tell any stories &#8211; it is a 20-minute view of the wreck unlike any I&#8217;ve ever seen before. The ability to actually look inside the ship as if I were actually there is both wonderful and horrific.<br />
Exiting from the film, I wandered around the wind-powered portion. The musty wooden smell was overwhelming at times, but reminded me of my sailing days. Then it was through the extensive Titanic exhibit, and the wrecks of the Atlantic. There have been a lot of ships lost on and around the shores of Nova Scotia.<br />
So many that I lost track of time. I ended up having to rush my tour of the rest of the museum.<br />
I half-jogged down to Brewery Market in the rain, which hadn&#8217;t relented one bit. Slightly dampened, I entered through the North Arch, the original portal through which delivery carts once parcelled kegs of beer to points around Halifax. (There is a groove worn away in the base of the arch from the wheels.)<br />
I joined the tour in progress. The tour starts in the present, then works its way back to 1820, where it begins in Alexander Keith&#8217;s dining room. The room is gorgeous, and looks like it should be hosting lavish dinners, not a five-person tour group including three men from Georgia, one from Vancouver, and a latecomer from Calgary.<br />
Above the fireplace is a painting that is actually a plasma television screen. It shows a seven-odd minute film about Alexander Keith and how he started his brewery. You&#8217;d think something like this would be a wonderfully historical piece, considering the money they spent. (It&#8217;s a very nice-looking production.) Only problem &#8211; it reads like a beer commercial. Go figure.<br />
When the movie ends, the main character (the brewmaster) calls out for Mr. Keith to continue the tour. You almost expect someone in character as Mr. Keith to open the next door. It&#8217;s not Mr. Keith, but the assistant brewmaster, who immediately apologizes for Mr. Keith &#8211; a busy man who must attend to affairs of the city. (Alexander Keith was twice mayor of Halifax.)<br />
The tour leads through an office, and then into a small brew house (seen through windows from the courtyard). I think beer is still brewed here, but it isn&#8217;t the main brewery &#8211; there&#8217;s no way this small room can create the entire batch of Keith&#8217;s sold in Canada. It&#8217;s not terribly informative, either.<br />
After the brew room comes the barrelling room. We expected to see the cellar, a malting room, all the things you&#8217;d expect when on a tour of a brewery. But instead, we ended up in the restored Stag&#8217;s Head &#8211; the basement of Keith&#8217;s original house, and the pub he used to operate. It was sampling time.<br />
I felt kind of bad for all the actors employed. They tried very hard to make the experience interesting. But with only five people in the tour, it was extremely quiet. With such a small crew, I would have liked them to drop the act, but I guess that&#8217;s part of their job. They did it well, though. I suspect with a larger group, the tour would be much better.<br />
It was still pouring outside. I had no particular place to go next, and touring downtown in the rain was not a particularly wise idea. I took shelter in the Four Points Sheraton before snagging a cab back to my hotel.<br />
I called to see if Chris, Amy, or Roger were around. None answered. (I knew they were all still in town.) Figuring I&#8217;d arrived back too late, and they&#8217;d gone to dinner, I called back leaving messages wishing them a safe trip back to Toronto, hoping our paths would cross again. When I called Roger to leave the message, he answered.<br />
Roger had been out playing golf with clients. In the driving rain. He&#8217;d been thoroughly soaked, despite wearing foul weather gear. But he&#8217;d still had a good day. Apparently, Amy and Chris were still out touring around &#8211; we would get together for dinner when they got back.<br />
Amy and Chris had been out in the Bay of Fundy, going as far as Kentville. Returning, they&#8217;d laid down for a little while before the four of us went out for Italian. Amy found Il Mercato in her Frommer&#8217;s guide &#8230; but it was the same one Daryl had recommended earlier.<br />
We ate, discussed our futures (collective and individual), and enjoyed the company. Eating our fill, we returned to the hotel. I said my goodbyes &#8211; I was leaving on the Bras D&#8217;or early the next morning, and would not see the three of them off.<br />
But I would get another chance.<br />
As I sat in the hotel&#8217;s bar, using their Internet connection, I heard a familiar voice exclaim: &#8220;Geoff!&#8221;  I looked up to see Tracy and her cousin. I had thought Chris, Amy, and I the last ones in the hotel (Roger had moved to the Westin for business). Both Tracy and Marc had extended their stay to visit their respective families.<br />
I would join Tracy and her cousin on the way back to Marc&#8217;s room. Marc&#8217;s friend was also there. Roger would arrive shortly thereafter, followed by Amy and Chris. It felt like the last party. I did not stay too long. I had an early morning.<br />
As I walked down the hall back to the elevators and to my room, the sounds of the small get together died out. The hallways became deathly quiet. Everyone was gone. We were the last.</p>

Day 30<br />
This is an entry I dreaded writing from the beginning. It&#8217;s the last one. It&#8217;s the last day. Today, people begin their trips home. Some are staying around for a little tourism, but they are few.<br />
I joined up with Duffy, Gerry, the Bills, the Robs, and Trish for a little excursion to the Bay of Fundy. Loading up into the crew&#8217;s two rented minivans, we took off out of the city for parts unknown. Gerry drove the first van, Trish navigating. Duffy followed in the second van.<br />
I sat next to Bill C. and behind Rob N. Bill, the crossword king, scribbled on his newspaper for most of the trip out. Our van was quiet, unlike Gerry&#8217;s. But it gave me time to think about how lucky I was. A small handful of people were given the chance to make this trip. Sure, it was hard and at times very frustrating, but in the end it was all worth it. This is an experience that I cannot imagine having passed up.<br />

Day 29<br />
Early morning call. The last one. Breakfast, grab things for the day, taxi to the station, and begin final set-up. New Media didn&#8217;t change from the day before, but others were moving around in the station to better locations. Luckily, it wasn&#8217;t too much work, and fairly expeditiously handled. When the CBC Halifax staff event began (it was our first of the day), we were all ready.<br />
So began a day that, at least for me, was little more than a blurry dream. It was pockmarked with little things, like each of us getting our chance at Be An Anchor, or exchanging addresses. The production was slowly running out of steam. One more event would have been too much.<br />
