	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>By morning the rain had stopped, leaving cool damp weather in its wake. We stirred shortly after 08:30, all of us awake in a relatively short period of time. Our first surprise was to open the curtains and find that we were the only ones left in the entire campground. We didn&#8217;t know what time the others had left, but we had slept through all of them. It was fortuitous on our side &#8212; no waiting for showers, and it allowed Stefan to sneak into the women&#8217;s washroom with Rebecca.<br />
Horse Cave was the only KOA office I didn&#8217;t go into. Thus the last postcards I had sent were from Memphis the day before. Stefan cleared up the charges with the KOA while we packed away our gear and prepared for the morning trip. Once we had the financial portions squared away, all we had to do was pull up to the pumping station and dump the grey water tank.<br />
I must have been extremely irritating that morning, my incessant suggestions to go to Mammoth Cave must have severely worn away the levels of patience in my companions. But I won. Exiting the campground, we turned south on I-65 for about 12 miles until we reached the exit for Mammoth Cave National Park, for a lengthy drive westward.<br />
I had this odd preconception that the cave entrance would be somewhere near the Interstate, or at least the road into the park would be a fairly major one. I came to the conclusion after driving for 15 minutes that spelunking wasn&#8217;t as high on most tourists&#8217; lists as it was on mine. Impatience soon gave away to anticipation as we pulled into the large (and mostly deserted) parking lot.<br />
We grabbed what gear we thought necessary, and changed into clothes more suitable for the environment we were to experience. If nothing else, our visit to the Cave of the Winds had taught us that caves are cool places, and sandals aren&#8217;t the most appropriate footwear. Oddly enough, our lessons were learned differently by each of us: I wore shoes, a long sleeved shirt, and shorts; Rebecca and Stefan wore jeans, t-shirts, and sandals; Dhar wore jeans, t-shirt, and shoes. Each of us would complain about our choice of clothes during our voyage beneath the surface of the Earth.<br />
We walked across the parking lot to the Visitor&#8217;s Center to buy a tour ticket. Just outside the stone and wood building were a series of wood and plastic signs listing the tour options. There were four options available to us: a short 45-minute tour, two 2-hour tours, and a six hour extravaganza. We opted for one of the two tours, one that would give us the greatest view of the underground cave system.<br />
Mammoth Cave is the largest cave in the world, with over 336 miles (560 kilometres) of charted passageways. The route we decided on barely scratched the surface of massive cavern, only a measly couple of miles. It was the longest distance covered in a two-hour tour. I had read a great deal about Mammoth Cave, mostly about the local stories about it and surrounding caves, such as Crystal Cave and Onyx Cave. But today&#8217;s tour would be about the largest, Mammoth Cave.<br />
We walked in through the main entrance and walked over to the ticket booths. Only two of the half-dozen wickets were open, a sure sign of the pre-tourist season. We were two minutes too late, or so I thought. We very hastily bought our tickets, got very rudimentary instructions from the wicket clerk, then darted out the doors, hung a right, and charged down a path until we saw a large group of people with two National Park guides leading the way. We quietly joined at the end of the group.<br />
We seemed to have not missed anything, the guide at the front of the group was starting to tell the story of how the cave was formed, pointing to the geological structure of the area (mostly limestone, almost a prerequisite for forming a cave), the type of climate in south-central Kentucky, and the cave&#8217;s location to larger bodies of water. The guide also introduced himself (alas, I cannot remember his name) and his partner whom I believe was named Bill.<br />
Upon finding the group, we had started to walk into a ravine. The ravine had a path built in the middle of the floor for tour groups to gain easier access to the cave entrances. Our destination was called the Historic Entrance, and was the nearest to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. There were a few other entrances to the cave (probably because accessing those areas would require a several hour round-trip trek through the cave&#8217;s winding passages to get there), which appeared to be mostly elevators.<br />
We arrived at a large depression in the ground (possibly a shallow sinkhole), with a staircase running down the edge of the depression to the floor. Just before we started to descend, our more talkative guide (in fact, he was the only one who spoke during the entire two hours &#8212; I think Bill was there only so our primary guide never had to stop talking to turn the lights on and off, or keep an eye on the people in the rear) told everyone to &#8220;give your tickets to the most responsible person in your group, and then have her give them to me&#8221;. Unlike others in the tour group, we already knew who the most responsible person was.<br />
There were also a couple basic rules: stay with the group, and don&#8217;t remove anything from the cave. This included dirt, rocks, cave crickets, bats, fish, and retired Park Rangers. (Another dose of dry wit from our guide.)<br />
And so we started down the stairs, slippery with wear and water, which continually dripped from the upper lip of the hole. At the bottom we encountered a large steel bar gate covering the entrance. This was assumedly to keep unguided visitors from getting hopelessly lost inside (which was not an impossibility). The floor inside was dirt, but very tightly packed from millions of feet walking over it. Along the right side of the passageway was a tube of some kind, buried partly in the floor. About halfway down the 300 foot hall was scientific equipment, measuring the speed of the wind and its temperature.<br />
Like most large caves, Mammoth Cave &#8220;breathed&#8221; with the seasons. During the summer it exhaled and during the winter it inhaled. Winter having ended, the cave was beginning to exhale. The breeze was surprisingly stiff, about 10 km/h. It was also fairly cool. The inside of the cave was 54 degrees Fahrenheit (about 12 degrees Celsius), which almost immediately started my leg hairs to stand on end. I should have worn my jeans.<br />
We arrived at the first room on the tour, which I believe was called Grand Central Station or The Rotunda. Either way, the room was huge: at least 500 feet in diametre and 50 feet tall. Small lights (compared to the rest of the structure) gave off a slight glow which illuminated enough of the cave to see without flashlights or other extra lighting. The room was almost circular, with two large hallways extending further into the rock. The ceiling was domed in steps, formed when parts of the ceiling collapsed. The floor of the room was mostly dirt, but had several holes dug into it, like those of an archeological site.<br />
There was good reason for the holes. Our guide (I&#8217;ll leave Bill out of the picture, since he really didn&#8217;t do much) started into the history of the cave, covering the first few million years in about thirty seconds. The human history started with the Native Indians, who used to come into the cave to collect minerals such as gypsum. Then with the arrival of the Revolutionary War, the cave came into use again because it could provide the one thing the American colonies needed to defeat the British: salt peter.<br />
Long, straight trees were cut down and bored out with a long drill to form tubes. One end of the tubes was tapered, then butted with the flat end of another tube. This process was repeated over and over again until a long wooden pipe ran from outside the Historic Entrance to the middle of the room we were standing in. (This was the tube that we saw walking into the cave, still preserved in its location even after 200 years.) The water was used to leech the sodium nitrate from the soil, which was then dried out, collected, and hauled by cart to the surface. The sodium nitrate was then converted to potassium nitrate, which when mixed with charcoal and sulfur, became gunpowder.<br />
Our guide then told us that many historians believe that a huge amount of minerals were extracted from the cave during the Revolutionary War, something on the order of several thousand tons. I simply couldn&#8217;t fathom that amount of material being removed, and still seeing so much matter remaining. Our guide however, had his own theory &#8212; that amount was significantly lower.<br />
He explained that the mine (as it was referred to) existed for seven years from 1776 to 1783. During that time, it was possible to have extract the amount of material that the historians claimed was removed. The guide&#8217;s theory was based on accounts of several cave-ins, and massive tremors that kept just about everyone out for nearly four years. The amount of nitrates that could have been removed was therefore significantly lower.<br />
At that time, he indicated the holes in the floor of the room. The were remnants of the original mines left behind by the slaves and their overseers. The water tank that had once stood over them had since been destroyed. An iron railing around the holes kept people from walking into the pits.<br />
Finishing his speech, the guide then led us down the left hallway. The tunnel was about 50 feet in diametre, and dimly lit. The geologic history of the cave was covered in substantially more detail, including the past three cave-ins. I suddenly wondered just how stable the cave was, not wanting to be crushed under 20 tons of falling rock. But I wasn&#8217;t too keen on frightening anyone and kept my thoughts to myself.<br />
After a couple of stops and a long winding walk, we came to a small set of displays showing a few of the artifacts found in the cave. These included sandals and reed torches the Native Indians had used to explore the cave. Sadly, the original specimens were no longer available, due to theft which either led to the items being stolen or put away for safe keeping.<br />
It was then to pass around the Giant&#8217;s Coffin and into the cave requisite Fat Man&#8217;s Misery / Tall Man&#8217;s Agony. A short, narrow passageway that only a kid could love. This was a long one too, winding around until we entered into a keyhole-shaped tunnel, eventually landing us in another largish room. We were told that the restrooms we would see were mirages. Either lack of funding or broken equipment led to the toilets being taken out of service.<br />
This room was a crossroads for the cave. Here we could go up into the &#8220;upper&#8221; regions of that area of the cave, or go down to the lower areas where the cave fish and cave crickets lived. (Dhar had caught a brief glimpse of one in the dim light as we staggered through the previous passageway.) The room had been discovered about a century earlier by a black slave, who was a professional tour guide in the cave. He had entered the room from the same route as us, but the bottom of the keyhole had been filled in with rocks and debris at the time. The same slave had mapped most of the cave within an hour&#8217;s walk of the Historic Entrance.<br />
Another requisite of cave visitation soon arrived upon us: the lights were turned off. Urban dwellers can never know the feeling of having two of your senses shut off completely. When the lights go out, there is total blackness. An unlit night sky in the middle of the densest forest doesn&#8217;t even come close to the darkness achieved at 300 feet below the surface. It&#8217;s chillingly silent too, no-one spoke &#8230; I don&#8217;t think many breathed. For a full minute we were left in the isolation, and it&#8217;s a feeling not soon forgotten.<br />
With the lights back on a moment later, we continued into the upper regions of the cave. Up there it was much wetter than the other areas of the cave we had been in. Small streams flowed along the sides of the tunnels, heavy dripping echoed from all around, even the air felt damp.<br />
After a while we found ourselves in one of the showcase areas of the cave. Here was Bottomless Pit (in reality only a couple hundred feet, but with the lights off you&#8217;d never know), which we walked over on a catwalk. It was a long way to the bottom, at which we could see a light green pool of water. I tried to take a picture, but didn&#8217;t leave the exposure on long enough.<br />
We then entered Mammoth Dome, a room so tall it couldn&#8217;t have fit lengthwise in The Rotunda. Water fell constantly from the ceiling &#8212; everyone got a little wet regardless of where they stood. Flowstone coated the walls and created a few large formations at the rear of the room. From there we climbed a huge steel tower (erected when the cave came under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service), and exited through a tunnel at the top of the room.<br />
From there we walked through a few passageways until we entered another large tunnel, about the same size as the one we had gone down near the beginning of the tour. To our left was intense darkness, and a sign warning visitors not to wander down the tunnel without a guide. The path was rigged with motion sensors, used either to turn on the lights or warn Security.<br />
We headed right and continued along a long bend until we found ourselves in the right tunnel leading from The Rotunda. Here our guide thanked us for following the rules, and leaving the Park Rangers where we found them. We crossed the dirt floor of the immense room and went out through the entrance tunnel. I attempted to take an exposure picture of The Rotunda, but my lack of a tripod didn&#8217;t make for a clear picture.<br />
As we reached the cave entrance, a small bat joined the exodus. No bigger than a baseball glove (wingspan and all), the little fledermaus couldn&#8217;t get out through the steel bars without veering away and into the exiting group. A few people yelped in fright and tried to back away. I tried to get a good look at it without interrupting its flight plan. But soon we were in the warmth of the sun, and heading back to the ravine path.<br />
Once again our guide thanked us for the tour, we thanked him and Bill for their time. The guide suggested that he and Bill would be glad to share some stories of the cave if someone bought them lunch. I considered it for a moment, thinking of all the interesting information we could dig out of them. Instead the four of us returned to the Behemoth.<br />
It was time for lunch, and we were starving. We were out of breakfast food, and were about to polish off the last of all the food we had. We circled around the parking lot until we found one of the park roadways, then drove along until we found an open picnic site. Only two other vehicles were in the vicinity: one other family having lunch, and a few workmen renovating the washrooms nearby.<br />
It was lunch time. The barbeque came out to cook hot dogs, and the stove inside the van was turned on to cook the macaroni and cheese. It would be a fairly simple meal: President&#8217;s Choice White Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese Dinner, and a few hot dogs to go along. It wasn&#8217;t quite as basic as Kraft Dinner and wieners, but came reasonably close to being typical student fare.<br />
That was assuming of course, that one recognized it as such. But Dhar wasn&#8217;t a typical student. Dhar had never had anything like Kraft Dinner before. I stood there in silent awe. I had met a person who had never eaten something I would eat for weeks on end because it was the cheapest thing I knew of.<br />
Our lunch was nothing special, and we treated it no different than any other. The pot of macaroni and cheese quickly vanished, and the last of the hot dogs were eaten. When we were finished, the last of our food was gone. From then on, we would have to buy the rest of our meals. We cleaned the area up, disposing of the waste, packed up the barbeque, cleaned the dishes, and hit the road.<br />
Returning to the I-65, we entered the northbound lanes with Dhar behind the wheel. Next stop: we didn&#8217;t know. After Graceland, we had started to play the trip more by ear. Mammoth Cave had never been a suggestion until we had entered Mississippi State. Having left our last destination, we had no formal idea of where we were going, only that it was in the general direction of home.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960502.145</strong><br />
<em>Day 12</em><br />
The KOA was deserted when we woke up this morning. We then ventured to Mammoth Cave. Much more &#8220;natural&#8221; than Cave of the Winds &#8211; where the floors were cement, you couldn&#8217;t tell. It was cold inside, only 54 degrees F at best.<br />
Last night we had a long chat about a great many things, mostly about sex and relationships.<br />
We&#8217;re currently on our way north towards home. Don&#8217;t know where we&#8217;re stopping next. Forgot to send Kathryn a postcard from Horse Cave / Mammoth Cave. Oh well&#8230;<br />
Hard to believe this trip is ending so soon. I don&#8217;t want to go back to life. I want to stay here where I don&#8217;t have responsibility except for myself.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A sure sign of a good vacation is how much you don&#8217;t want to go home. None of us really wanted to. If we had the choice, I think we would&#8217;ve kept rolling as far as our credit limits would&#8217;ve allowed. Nevertheless, deep inside we were responsible and we knew that as much as we didn&#8217;t want to go, home was were we had to be. Maybe not so much with Dhar and I, but Eric and Thea were expecting their parents to return home from their trek across America.<br />
Around 16:00 we arrived in the Louisville area. Here we had to switch Interstates so we could continue in the proper direction. This necessitated a shift from I-65 to I-265, then to I-71. We stayed on I-71 for almost another two hours before arriving at I-75, which took us due north into Cincinnati, Ohio at around 18:00.<br />
I am a child of the 70&#8217;s &#8212; I grew up watching WKRP In Cincinnati. I remembered the opening theme, where the camera pans through the downtown core along one of the highways. It looked a little too urbanized, but it was my only impression of Cincinnati. I always had a desire to one day see the city, and try to spot the building that broadcasted Doctor Johnny Fever to the world (or at least the Greater Cincinnati area).<br />
Alas, it was not to be. The I-75 crossed to what looked like the west side of the city, and revealed nothing. We continued up I-75 until we reached I-275. By this point we&#8217;d figured out that we needed to be on I-71 again, which took us in a more northeasterly direction, more appropriate for our triumphant return to the Great White North. We traveled east on I-275 for six miles until joining up with I-71 to head northeast.<br />
About an hour after leaving the Greater Cincinnati area, our stomachs began to growl profusely again. It seemed time to feed the monsters within. Luckily for us, we were in a 30 mile stretch in the middle of southern Ohio that had no places to stop and buy dinner. We came across our salvation at a Shoney&#8217;s in Jeffersonville.<br />
Americans seemed to be obsessed with restaurant chains that mimic home cooking. I&#8217;ve been to several, and for some strange reason they all have pluralized names. We pulled up, tried to make ourselves look as presentable as possible, then sauntered in for our repast. Just inside the door awaited luscious desserts all waiting to be sampled. But sugar wasn&#8217;t high on my priority list at the time, I was more interested in something solid.<br />
We were led to a table by the hostess, and greeted by our waitress Christina a few moments later. It was now 19:30, and if nothing else the sounds emanating from our abdomens indicated that if we didn&#8217;t receive sustenance soon, we would start eating the table.<br />
Dhar seemed to have his head stuck in New Orleans, he ordered the seafood trio to calm his nerves. Likewise with Rebecca, who didn&#8217;t seem to get enough blackened red fish at CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon, she opted for the blackened cod. Stefan went for the charbroiled chicken, and I for an eight ounce sirloin steak. All of us took the salad bar option, we knew that no matter what we would get our money&#8217;s worth there.<br />
For the next 10 minutes we gorged ourselves on salads of all kinds. Then our entrees appeared. I couldn&#8217;t believe the speed at which our meals had arrived. I hadn&#8217;t had enough time to eat the second salad! I&#8217;ll tell you something: Shoney&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sacrifice quality for their speed &#8212; our meals were delicious. (Mind you, if the last meal was macaroni and cheese, nearly anything from a restaurant will be delicious.)<br />
It took less time to eat our entrees than it took us to park, make sure we weren&#8217;t disgusting, climb out of the van, and come into the restaurant. When Christina returned to ask what we thought of our meals, I caught the look of stifled astonishment to the speed our eating habits. Dessert went substantially slower, and only Rebecca and I indulged ourselves in that.<br />
Rebecca wanted coffee. I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d had coffee since the Perkins we went to in Kansas. She actually shook a little when she started drinking it, but soon the look of a devoted caffeine addict crossed her face and she slipped into her own little coffee coma. My kick at the cat came with an Oreo Cookie Sundae. This manifestation of evil was so loaded with sugar, I was wired until we reached Cleveland.<br />
At 20:00, we were back on board the Behemoth and heading northeast towards New York State. We could&#8217;ve saved some time and money by taking I-75 through Toledo and around the west end of Lake Erie. That would have not only returned us to Canada (and ultimately, home) much sooner, but avoided the toll booths in New York. But Niagara Falls was now on the agenda, no matter what time we got there. And so we drove.<br />
Sometime around 23:00 to 00:00 (and deep inside Ohio), we had to stop for gas &#8230; the Behemoth was running low. Wherever we were, it wasn&#8217;t heavily populated &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t seen much other than tree silhouettes for the past hour. We pulled into the cheapest station on the off-ramp and promptly set about refilling our tanks. I made a quick escape into the station to get some snack foods.<br />
Dhar was having a conversation with some of the local teens when I returned, two men and a slightly younger woman. They were at least 16 years old (looked closer to 18), as they were driving a Jeep pickup truck. I ignored the initial banter and climbed in through the side door to put my loot in the fridge to keep cool.<br />
The two men disappeared into the station store a moment later, and the woman came over to view the Behemoth. I quickly became interested in the conversation again. We invited her in, and asked her to excuse the general mess we had inside. She was just short of amazed at the vehicle we had in our possession. She was even more amazed when she found out whereabouts we had been in the last 11 days. She commented that she and her friends had similar aspirations, but didn&#8217;t know how they were going to go about doing it.<br />
Soon the two men returned to the truck, and the woman bounced out after them. Almost immediately Stefan and Rebecca jumped into the back, declaring that it was someone else&#8217;s turn to drive. Still wired from the Oreo Sundae, I volunteered and climbed behind the wheel. A moment later we were back on the I-71 heading for home.<br />
We had come to the realization that we were only five hours from home, and there wasn&#8217;t really anything along the way that we just had to see. It was a quick decision to make a last push for home. Even then, we still wouldn&#8217;t arrive until almost daybreak.<br />
About 30 miles outside Cleveland we broke from I-71 to I-271 to skirt around the outer edges of the city, eventually picking up I-90 on the eastern side. This took us along the south shore of Lake Erie through the rest of Ohio, into the 47 mile stretch of I-90 as it went through Pennsylvania, finally turning into the New York State Thruway once we crossed the state line.<br />
Despite the short distance we had to cover, Pennsylvania was a long state, due entirely to the conversation I had with Rebecca. I have no recollection how we got onto the topic, but we entered into a heated debate about definition. For those of you just joining us, Rebecca is an educated expert in women&#8217;s studies and sexuality. I&#8217;m an English major. Differences were bound to exist.<br />
We got onto a discussion of Freud (as in Dr. Sigmund, obsessed with possessing his mother). I personally don&#8217;t think very highly of Freud, I think he spent too much time relating everything to sex. (I don&#8217;t think he got laid very often.) Rebecca told me of one of Freud&#8217;s theories that said children are very sexual beings. At first I thought she said &#8220;sensual&#8221;, which I partly agreed to. &#8220;Sexual&#8221; on the other hand, I completely objected to that.<br />
Again, I repeat that I&#8217;m an English major. Hence, I know and follow dictionary meanings. I have this kooky perception that keeps me from inventing new definitions for words &#8212; otherwise our language gets too unwieldy and difficult to use (as if it already isn&#8217;t). &#8220;Sensual&#8221; I can understand because the word applies to the senses: kids touch and eat everything in sight, regardless of what it is. &#8220;Sexual&#8221; I disagree with because according to my dictionaries (mental and Random House) give no indication of definition outside of that pertaining to sex. In my opinion, children do not have, nor should participate in, sex.<br />
But I remind you, this is solely my opinion. Rebecca was all for using &#8220;sexual&#8221; as an adjective for children, comparing it with &#8220;sensual&#8221;. This she got from Freud. Again, I don&#8217;t think too highly of Freud. I think he needed to use a dictionary more often.<br />
New York was long and boring. The I-90 through New York is much like several Interstates that run through the middle of other states: there&#8217;s nothing on either side but trees. A little over an hour after entering the state, the Buffalo city limits sign whipped by our windows. What little exhaustion had started to creep into my system suddenly fled as the goal of our day rapidly appeared. It was after 03:00 and I&#8217;d been driving for over seven hours &#8230; the sight of home only made me want to drive all the more.<br />
We hit our first toll just after seeing the city limits sign. I griped about it silently, tossed in the toll, then sped on to the interchange for the I-190. Less than a quarter-mile into the I-190, another toll and another gripe. We headed due west until the I-190 curved north again to the Peace Bridge off-ramp. We entered the bridge toll area and drove up to one of the non-truck gates. All but the truck gate were closed for the night. We hastily backed up, crossed a few lanes, and scooted up to the truck booth. We paid our toll, and crossed the bridge to freedom.<br />
Upon entering New York State, we had taken the precaution of figuring out exactly how much stuff we had bought while on the trip. Dhar had won by a landslide, easily bringing back more stuff than the rest of us combined. But we were all under our personal limits. When we reached customs on the Canada side of the bridge, we were ready for any question.<br />
&#8220;Good evening,&#8221; said the Customs clerk. He was a man in his 30&#8217;s, with a black mustache and hair.<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Evening!&#8221; I replied, a little too cheerily.<br />
&#8220;Where are you folks coming from?&#8221; he asked.<br />
&#8220;All over the United States. Just finishing a 12 day tour.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I see. Everyone in there Canadian?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Yessir!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Who&#8217;s all in there?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Uh, me, her, him, and him!&#8221;<br />
(Okay, so we were ready for all the questions except who we were. Let&#8217;s face it, after that long together, I think just about anyone would have a tough time figuring out who they were.)<br />
&#8220;Names?&#8221; The clerk wasn&#8217;t amused at my blunder. We quickly dug out our birth certificates and drivers licenses.<br />
&#8220;Anything to declare?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Nope!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Welcome home.&#8221;<br />
We were home. Almost immediately I felt like someone had just put a warm wool Hudson&#8217;s Bay blanket around me and handed me a cup of hot maple syrup. We drove onto the QEW and started towards Oakville. We drove to Highway 420, which we then took to downtown Niagara Falls so we could get a look at the Falls, even though it was 04:00 in the morning. Along the way we stopped at a Country Time donut shop to grab a quick snack. It was such a relief to taste a Canadian donut again (even if it wasn&#8217;t from Tim Horton&#8217;s).<br />
Downtown Niagara Falls was utterly dead. The entire time we were there, I only saw one other car on the road (not counting the two cop cars, those were expected). The night lights on the Falls were off, I had assumed they stayed on all night. Much to my disappointment, they didn&#8217;t. All we could see was a dark wall, the mist in the air, and water on the road where the mist fell. We made two passes and headed back out to the QEW.<br />
This part I could nearly do in my sleep. I hadn&#8217;t driven it too many times, but the route was very familiar to me. We passed over the Welland Canal, through St. Catherines, through Grimsby (which many of my friends testify that it&#8217;s a gateway to another dimension), past Hamilton, over the Burlington Skyway, through Burlington, and into Oakville.<br />
As we neared the off-ramp for Trafalgar Road, I suddenly came to the shocking realization that I didn&#8217;t have a house key. We would have to sleep in the Behemoth one more night. I pulled onto Trafalgar Road, and headed south to Cornwall Road. I took this east to Maplegrove Road, then south again to Devon Road. East briefly to Pinehurst Road, south to Gatestone Avenue, and parked right behind my father&#8217;s van at 05:45. We quickly unpacked the sleeping bags and passed out.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Arriving at a quarter to five in the morning, we have finally ended our tour around the continent. Unfortunately we must still camp a night as I do not have the house keys.The border crossing was interesting &#8211; when asked who was in the van, I replied: &#8220;Me, her, him, and him.&#8221; But we had no other problems. We even saw some of the Falls. It&#8217;s good to be home.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Little kids sounded the morning knell, much like how an air raid siren warns of impending disaster. I&#8217;m not suggesting that we had a bad day, but it&#8217;s not exactly the way I&#8217;d wanted to start it off. Our waking patterns were reestablished that morning: Dhar first, soon followed by me, then Rebecca, and Stefan some time later. The morning was not nearly as cool as the night had been, the sun had come out and started warming the air.<br />
In the daylight we got our first good look at the camp. It was similar to the one we had stayed at in Colorado Springs: no attempts to spruce it up at all. But this particular KOA didn&#8217;t even have the beauty of nature to fall back on. There was no creek, no view of mountains, no feeling of isolation. A Days Inn lay between us and Elvis Presley Boulevard, and a high wooden fence was erected behind us.<br />
The morning shower ritual was enacted, our regular runs to the KOA office for postcard duties and post-registration performed, all pretty much to schedule and rhythm. Except the post-registration. That particular KOA wasn&#8217;t a very well-managed one. The esthetics of the camp were obviously not of any concern, nor was the fair treatment of the guests. We had parked in a site that had no hook-ups of any kind, thus we were supposed to pay only for a site of that type. However, so the staff claimed, we had an RV, which automatically meant we had to pay for a hook-up site. Stefan did not give into that kind of logic, and argued with them for at fifteen minutes before they finally caved in and charged us only for a basic site. It became brutally obvious that the KOA had only been built to service visitors to Graceland, with no concern for anything other than profit.<br />
Our breakfast was the last of the donuts. Still cold, still sticky-sweet, they were still good. The plan of the day was simple: visit Graceland, and cover more distance heading home. Stefan and I had originally not wanted to be home too early, but Stefan had also said he wanted to be home on the Saturday (it was a Wednesday on that date) so we also wanted to make sure that we were within striking distance of home.<br />
Hitting the road took only a few minutes that morning &#8212; not having to unhook the Behemoth from the utilities takes a great deal of time off your clock. We turned right to head further south on Elvis Presley Boulevard. In only a few moments we had arrived at the Home of the King. On our left was the legendary estate, on our right the visitor&#8217;s parking and other museums that were parts of the Graceland tour.<br />
The parking lot had only a quarter of the 300+ spots filled. For us, this was a good sign because it meant that once again we had skirted the crowds &#8212; a big plus for Dhar. As we headed to what we assumed was the main entrance, we passed a few people wearing Elvis t-shirts heading towards their vehicle. We were entering a dimension beyond sight and sound &#8230; just around that bend: The Elvis Zone.<br />
The ticket lobby was almost deserted. In the middle of &#8220;tourist season&#8221;, this room would probably be packed with avid Elvis fans (the kind whom I wanted to avoid). Immediately on the left of the doors was a bank machine. Realizing that my $100 from Las Vegas had almost run out, I opted to make another $100 withdrawal before doing anything else.<br />
By the time I got to the ticket wicket with my newly acquired cash, the others had already bought their tickets. When I bought mine, not only did I get a second ticket (explained in a moment), but I ended up on a different tour number! Mildly annoyed at this, I was told that the tour number really didn&#8217;t matter. I assumed that the numbering system only really came into play during the heavier visitor days.<br />
Now for the second ticket business. We bought access to all the exhibits available, a total of five venues: the Graceland mansion, the Automobile museum, an personal items collection, a 15 minute movie about Elvis, and the Lisa Marie. Normally all these are printed on the same ticket, which has five tear-off portions. The ticket clerk made a mistake however and had to print me two tickets.<br />
While I was purchasing my tickets, Dhar was trying to withdraw $100 from the bank machine in the lobby &#8230; without success. I wanted to tell him he wasn&#8217;t going to have any luck no matter where we went, but I figured he didn&#8217;t want to hear it. Besides, he still had a fair bit of Canadian money he could exchange at a bank.<br />
We exited through the &#8220;front doors&#8221; (we had come in through the &#8220;side doors&#8221;) to the departure station, where a tour guide tore off the mansion ticket and handed us a pair of headphones and a small black box about the size and weight of a small car. I had thought the tour would be guided by the Graceland staff. But things were done a bit differently there &#8212; the black box was a rudimentary cassette player that took visitors on a 45 minute tour of the Graceland mansion. The idea was fairly simple: follow the cues and you&#8217;ll hear things in sync with the voices.<br />
We boarded the small bus that would ferry us across Elvis Presley Boulevard and up to the front doors of the mansion. Just before leaving, the guide told us to turn the cassette players on. I did so, and started listening to the calming male voice that welcomed us to Graceland. I made a judgment mistake though, believing the voice asked us to keep the players off until we were inside Graceland. This put me five minutes behind everyone else for a while.<br />
Reaching the top of the hill upon which the mansion sat, we disembarked and followed the tour guides&#8217; directions into the house. To say the least, I wasn&#8217;t prepared for what lay within the doors. The first thing we saw upon entering was a staircase about 15 feet from the doorway. This ran up to the second level of the house, closed to visitors. (I know, &#8220;Oooooh! A staircase!&#8221; But that&#8217;s the point &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t some grand balustrade, it was just an ordinary set of stairs.)<br />
The Voice directed us to our right, towards the Piano Room. It was so called because of the piano at the far end. (He may have been the King, but that doesn&#8217;t mean he was terribly original.) The room was about 15 feet wide and 30 feet long, divided partially in the middle with a pair of brightly coloured stained glass peacock windows. The colour scheme in the room was mostly white, with several gold accents on the walls, ceiling, piano, and on the couches.<br />
The Voice then directed us to the stairway that we had seen on our way in. We were told that Elvis used to give karate demonstrations there for his guests. For a brief flash, I honestly thought I could see Elvis doing just that. It was then that I came to know the reason why so many people return to Graceland: it&#8217;s real. Not a museum piece, not a recreation &#8230; this was how Elvis had lived, this was where his life was lived out for two decades. The decorations, the carpet, the design of the grounds &#8230; everything came from his mind, undiluted with time or renovations.<br />
Again The Voice turned us to the left to see the Dining Room, opposite to the Piano Room. It wasn&#8217;t a very large room, maybe 20 feet square. The table had places for about half a dozen people. Two large televisions were in opposite corners of the room. The Voice suddenly gave way to Priscilla Presley, Elvis&#8217; widow. She began to tell us about some of her memories of her life at Graceland, living with the King. She would do so several times during the tour.<br />
I had a problem with Priscilla, but it wasn&#8217;t anything to do with her marriage to Elvis, or her current life. It was her little speeches &#8230; they were all fake. I will be one of the first to say that Priscilla isn&#8217;t the world&#8217;s foremost actress. She does wonderful dead-pan comedy, particularly next to the King of Dead-pan (Leslie Nielsen), but drama isn&#8217;t her forte. I could tell within seconds that she was reading off a script:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Voice:</strong> Priscilla Presley tells us of her life at Graceland&#8230; (The Voice and music fades out)<br />
<strong>Priscilla:</strong> Elvis loved having people over for dinner, usually with the guys. (Speaks reminiscently) He&#8217;d sit at the head of the table and tell some of the funniest stories you ever heard. (Laughs slightly) (Slight pause) He was kind, caring man&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>This annoyed the hell out of me. I don&#8217;t know if it was Priscilla who wrote the script, or Graceland Enterprises for the purposes of the tour. Either way, it was not they method I would have used to illicit a portion of the tour from the widow of the King. The best method, in my humble opinion, would have been to take Ms. Presley on a tour of the house in the same order as visitors, and have her tell unprompted stories as she went. Edit the voice cuts later on and splice into the tour tape. The scripting of the stories nearly ruined the tour for me.<br />
From the Dining Room we passed into the kitchen, added to the tour only after Elvis&#8217; aunt had died a year earlier &#8212; she used to spend all her time in the kitchen. Although I had never truly thought about it before, I had an expectation of a huge kitchen with a huge fridge, giant counters for use by a team of expert chefs, coloured completely stark white and gleaming chrome.<br />
If there is any room that speaks more about a person than any other, it&#8217;s got to be the kitchen. It was small, 10 feet wide about 20 feet long. Wooden cabinets, deep brown carpeting, and standard appliances. It was the same kitchen you could expect to see in just about anyone&#8217;s home, there wasn&#8217;t anything special about it. Stepping into this man&#8217;s kitchen, all my views of this eclectic, mysterious, phenomenal man all came crashing to the ground &#8212; Elvis was no different than anyone else, he just led a more extraordinary life than most.<br />
Around a corner and down the stairs, we arrived in the TV Room, so named for the three televisions set into the far wall. The colour scheme was mostly yellow (my sister swore upon seeing the pictures that Elvis was colourblind), with two couches, a glass table, a wet bar, and a small ceramic monkey in the centre of the table. The TVs were the result of Elvis hearing that then-President Johnson watched two at a time.<br />
Walking back out of the door, we crossed the staircase hall into the Pool Room. About 15 feet square, the room had only one purpose, the pool table that sat proudly in the middle. But the table wasn&#8217;t what caught my eye &#8212; it was the 2,000 feet of multi-coloured fabric that was pleated all over the walls. Gaudy to some, I actually rather liked the idea (though cleaning it must be a big problem). The Voice mentioned that a tear on the table (which I hadn&#8217;t noticed until The Voice drew my attention to it) was caused by one of the &#8220;Memphis Mafia&#8221; (how Elvis&#8217; entourage was often referred to) .<br />
We then exited the Pool Room through another door, passing through a small non-descript room, and up a flight of stairs into the Jungle Room. The name came from the decor of the room, which included a fountain on the left wall, deep pile green carpeting on the floor and the ceiling (oh, the styles of the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s), and the most hideous-looking furniture I have ever seen in my life.<br />
The Voice told the story of how Elvis purchased the furniture. He was apparently walking through downtown Memphis one day, and happened to see the chair and a couple of couches sitting in the display window of a furniture store. He loved them so much, he bought the entire set and had it shipped to Graceland immediately. The couch was so big the windows had to be removed to move it inside. Why he bought the set, I don&#8217;t know: the fabric alone is reason enough to worry about Elvis&#8217; decorating sense &#8212; it&#8217;s brown and beige zebra-striped fake fur. It&#8217;s ghastly.<br />
The Jungle Room has the fame of being the site of Elvis&#8217; last recording session. His last album was recorded in the Jungle Room, and was released just before he died on August 16, 1977. I was five years and one month old on that day, and I remember my mother being rather shocked at the news. Being so young, the event passed by me without notice.<br />
We then progressed out the back door into the back yard of the mansion. We walked under a large roof (where I assume Elvis parked his cars, since I couldn&#8217;t see a garage anywhere) to an office building about 100 feet away from the house. As we crossed the short expanse, The Voice told us of Elvis&#8217; passion of driving his converted snowmobiles (becoming grass-mobiles during the spring and summer months) around the yard, which often scared his daughter Lisa-Marie half to death. Elvis also enjoyed games of firecracker tag with the Memphis Mafia, shooting roman candles at each other.<br />
In the office (on prompting from The Voice) we watched a short news reel that had been taken in the office when Elvis had returned from his stint in the Army. The office had been his father&#8217;s, and was left almost in the same manner that it had been in when Elvis died. Adjacent to the office was a small shooting range Elvis used from time to time.<br />
We then proceeded along another concrete path towards another building. The Voice told us of the Presley&#8217;s love of horses. Several horses were on the Graceland grounds, but no-one mentioned whether or not they were the original residents. The Graceland grounds were suitable for horses, the back yard was at least the length of a football field, and possibly the same distance in width.<br />
The next building was a small museum, carrying visitors from The King&#8217;s humble start, right to his last performance. The first room was the beginning of it all, Elvis&#8217; start in the early 50&#8217;s and all the trouble he got himself into with that dynamic pelvis. Misunderstanding a cue, I turned my tour cassette off and ended up having to wander about in the room much longer than I wanted to just so I could catch up (there was no &#8220;fast forward&#8221; button).<br />
The next room was known as the &#8220;Hall of Gold&#8221;, and contained every award Elvis had ever won. Ten feet wide and 50 or 60 feet long, the blue passage glittered with gold records on both sides. At the very end of the hall was an enormous plaque Elvis had received for all the money and time he had donated to various charities in the Memphis area. Elvis was one of the last great performers who regularly gave back to his community. Today&#8217;s Gen-X musicians would never consider such deeds &#8212; they&#8217;re either too absorbed in themselves or too desperate to die.<br />
At the end of the &#8220;Hall of Gold&#8221;, I (now separated from Dhar and from Stefan and Rebecca) entered another portion of the museum, which picked up where the first room had left off. More history of Elvis, starting with his Army uniform. Various pieces of fan mail, posters and costumes from his movies, a huge painting, the one and only Gold Lamay suit, the black leather outfit from his televised comeback special, the Eagle suit from his Hawaii concert, his karate jumpsuit and his black belt, and his police badge collection. All around was his famous &#8220;TCB&#8221; logo, stylized with a lightning bolt. It stood for: &#8220;Taking care of business in a flash.&#8221;<br />
Then it was out the door and across another concrete pathway to another building in the yard. This was originally a racquetball / squash court, but was now another museum to his many album sales records. But the focal point of the building wasn&#8217;t the glittering wall at the far end, it was the piano that sat behind the protective glass wall. It was there that Elvis played his last song, on the evening of August 15, 1977. Feeling a little tired, he rested awhile before going to bed. The next morning Elvis was found dead, the morning he was supposed to start his next tour.<br />
By this point I had caught up with Dhar, who had stopped his tape a while ago in hopes the rest of us would catch up. Dhar had become rather bored with the tour and had flipped the cassette tape over and rewound part of the tape (there was a &#8220;review&#8221; button), in effect fast forwarding through part of the tape. The two of us then exited through the side door and walked over to the Meditation Garden.<br />
The Meditation Garden is the final resting place of Elvis Aaron Presley &#8230; for those who believe he&#8217;s dead. Elvis&#8217; mother, father, and grandmother all rest there as well. There&#8217;s even a memorial plaque to Elvis&#8217; stillborn twin brother. According to The Voice, flowers arrive continually all year long (with significant increases on Elvis&#8217; birthday and on the anniversary of his death), and are left until the real flowers wilt and the fake ones look weather-beaten.<br />
The tour ended at that point, and Dhar and I shared a quiet moment staring at the quiet grave. But for me, there was something more to the mansion &#8212; there was a spirit there. I don&#8217;t know if it was Elvis, or just the essence of who and what he was. But you could feel there was something there, watching you, welcoming you, wanting to tell you all there was to know, saying good-bye as you left. In the Memorial Gardens, that spirit is most strongly felt.<br />
Rounding the swimming pool at the side of the mansion, we walked around to the front to pick up our bus back to the other side of Elvis Presley Boulevard. There we finally got our first good look at the house. Despite all that we had seen, it didn&#8217;t look all that different than many of the houses in my home town. It wasn&#8217;t huge, but sat on a very large lot. It looked comfortable, and undoubtedly was. It was a home someone was proud to have owned.<br />
The bus ferried us back to the rest of the Graceland attractions. There we returned our tour cassette players, and started to view the rest of the museums. The first in our list was Elvis&#8217; automobile collection. Elvis loved his cars &#8212; he had a lot of them.<br />
Entering the museum (and having another ticket torn off), we walked around a corner to the first part of the collection: a series of motorcycles and tricycles Elvis once drove. While I was taking a picture, one of the other visitors decided that he would try his luck at touching a piece of Elvis &#8230; and set of the security alarm. It seemed that all the vehicles in the exhibits had a grounded security system, the slightest touch set it off. The man jerked upright, slightly shocked, and hastily walked away. A security guard rounded a corner a moment later, looked around, then went back out front.<br />
In front of a large wall of lights that curved over-top was an Astin-Martin, the kind of car that James Bond used to drive (before he switched to a BMW). The lights bounced beautifully off the shiny black car, making an interesting view.<br />
In the middle of the main portion of the museum was a replica drive-in theatre (complete with removed front seats from cars) where a 15 minute looping movie of the cars in Elvis&#8217; movies played. I caught glimpses of it, but never watched the whole thing.<br />
One of the vehicles from Elvis&#8217; movies was the pink jeep from Blue Hawaii. It&#8217;s tacky, it&#8217;s pink, and it&#8217;s the kind of thing that seemed to prevail though many movies of that period. It was also, sadly, a fake. According to a plaque in front of it, a previous visitor had pointed out that the original jeep was either destroyed or bought by someone else, Elvis had bought a replica.<br />
One of the most ugly cars in his collection was a Stutz Blackman, built by the Stutz Motor Company. It&#8217;s striking lines and very angled shape leads to a very displeasing car to look at &#8212; as my friend Scott put it, a very 70&#8217;s look. Like it&#8217;s name, the car was black &#8230; so black you couldn&#8217;t tell where the edges of the car were.<br />
I think Elvis had a penchant for pink vehicles &#8212; a pink Cadillac was also on display. But not his pearl and gold Cadillac. A sign put on one side indicated that the well-known limousine was on permanent display at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville. Then it was into a small gift shop, the theme centering around the automobile collection.<br />
The next museum contained more items from Elvis, mostly of a more personal nature. These included Lisa Marie&#8217;s crib and baby clothes, Elvis&#8217; desk and pens, a couple chairs, some clothes, and one of the lamps from the 70&#8217;s redecoration. According to an accompanying sign, the lamp was all that remained of the last redecoration before Elvis died: red shag carpets on the floors, walls, and ceiling; the gaudy gold lamps; essentially outrageous things that most sane people wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead with today. When Graceland had been set up for a tourist attraction, the decor was reverted to one that had been in place in the 60&#8217;s. Then it was through another gift shop.<br />
Outside the temperature was warm, without being uncomfortable. We were all a little tired from all the walking and viewing, and above all we were hungry. But we also wanted to get through the rest of the attractions and hit the road so we could go to a bank and get Dhar some American funds.<br />
The next stop was the movie, which was a brief history of Elvis&#8217; early years and the philosophy of life he had. Then it was through another gift shop.<br />
Our final stop was at the Lisa Marie, one of Elvis&#8217; two private planes. Northwest Airlines had their grubby little fingers in this affair, setting up a mock check-in counter. You also had to pass through an Elvis Fan Detector (in the style of a normal airport metal detector). On the walls of the &#8220;pre-flight lounge&#8221; were various bits of trivia about the use of the Lisa Marie, including the details on Elvis&#8217; notorious middle-of-the-night flight to Denver for peanut butter sandwiches.<br />
The Lisa Marie was a Convair 880 built in 1958 by General Dynamics. Elvis bought the plane in 1975 and gave it an $800,000 dollar makeover to suit his needs. (Elvis&#8217; second plane, a Lockheed JetStar, cost him nearly $900,000 and was less than half the size of the Convair.) Elvis named the plane after his daughter, and designated it 880EP.<br />
Both planes are permanently grounded, the engines removed and the avionics disabled. One of the Lisa Marie&#8217;s engines sat over to one side for visitors to view. The others were donated to high schools and technical institutes to assist students in learning to build jet engines.<br />
Dhar and I looked at the JetStar first, which Elvis called &#8220;Hound Dog Two&#8221; (the Lisa Marie was &#8220;Hound Dog One&#8221;). Compared to its much larger companion, it wasn&#8217;t worth the look. Stefan and Rebecca however, had to see for themselves. Dhar and I waited at the foot of the Lisa Marie&#8217;s stairs for Stefan and Rebecca to join us.<br />
We climbed the steps and stepped through the forward hatch. To our left was the cockpit, shielded by a sheet of Plexiglas. To our immediate right was the forward bathroom (similarly shielded), complete with brass taps and a gold-flecked sink. Just beyond that was the first compartment. This was primarily chairs with a single coffee table on the left hand side. A TV at the side of the room repeated stories and information about that compartment of the plane. All the furniture was leather, but covered in plastic.<br />
The next room was the conference room. This had a long conference table, surrounded by ten leather chairs. Here too all the items had plastic covers &#8230; assumedly so visitors wouldn&#8217;t destroy the valuable museum piece. Lisa Marie Presley held her seventh birthday party at that table. Just beyond the table was one of the first air-phones, which Elvis had installed for his use.<br />
The conference room, like the other two rooms, had a large TV in it. The plane also had a videocassette player, which Elvis used to watch movies. I was really surprised (and oddly proud) to discover that Elvis and I shared a common liking of certain movies. Among his favourites were Mel Brooks&#8217; Blazing Saddles, and Monty Python&#8217;s Monty Python and the Holy Grail.<br />
The last compartment of the plane was Elvis&#8217; bedroom. A queen-sized bed occupied most of the space (also covered in plastic), complete with an FAA-standard seat belt across the middle of the bed. The tail section bore the bathroom, similar but larger to the forward bathroom, and included a shower. Then it was out through the rear hatch and down the stairs to the tarmac.<br />
We entered our last gift shop a moment later, on our way out of the Graceland attractions. As we entered into the shop from the Lisa Marie, we saw a desk to one side with a collection of cookbooks on display. They were written by Elvis&#8217; uncle Vester. A mannequin sat behind the desk, a likeness of Uncle Vester. At least I thought it was a mannequin &#8230; until I saw it move.<br />
I nearly jumped out of my skin. So did Dhar. For a moment, I had to stare at the sickly-looking old man to make sure that he was in fact human, and alive. Sure enough, ol&#8217; Uncle Vester was sitting behind the desk, peddling his cookbooks to anyone who cared enough to step forward and pick up a copy. I say &#8220;cared&#8221; because you couldn&#8217;t help feel sorry for the man &#8212; you really had to wonder if he wanted to be there. I&#8217;ve seen dogs with their tails between their legs look more chipper than this poor man. He just sat there, looking blanking forward not noticing a soul, looking like he was waiting for death.<br />
After a few minutes, we finally returned to the Behemoth and prepared to move out. As we passed by Graceland, I waved a mental good-bye, knowing that one day I would return. It was time for us to turn our view to the next task at hand. Rebecca had gone to the trouble of asking for the nearest bank so we could get Dhar&#8217;s Canadian funds changed into American. That required a further trip south to a local Savings and Loan. Dhar ran in while the rest of us waited. A few minutes later he ran back out, shaking his head.<br />
The bank wouldn&#8217;t exchange it &#8230; rather, couldn&#8217;t exchange it. Apparently, Canadian funds were treated like funny money that far south, and your average bank couldn&#8217;t handle the transfer. (Stupid banks.) But the First National Bank of Tennessee was supposedly capable. So on the directions Dhar gave me, given to him by one of the bank clerks, we headed still further south on Elvis Presley Boulevard in search of greenbacks.<br />
But even the First National Bank of Tennessee couldn&#8217;t do it. I couldn&#8217;t believe that we were so far from home that everyone was completely incompetent at such a simple task. But when you deal with a hundred small banks instead of a few large ones, problems happen.<br />
Fortunately one of us was thinking that afternoon, and struck upon the idea that the airport might be able to do the exchange. We had reached the point where any idea was worth trying, so made our way north on Elvis Presley Boulevard to Winchester Road. We headed east until we found signs to point us towards Memphis International Airport&#8217;s terminal.<br />
After enough loops and turns to get anyone hopelessly lost, I pulled up in front of the terminal, and Dhar took off to find the exchange counter. Rebecca and Stefan followed suit, although I&#8217;m not sure if they went for the same reasons as Dhar. I sat there, hoping that some ticket-happy airport cop wouldn&#8217;t decide to fulfill his quota that afternoon.<br />
After five minutes, any fears I had were squashed when the three of them emerged from the terminal, all smiles and sunshine. It was mission accomplished, and time for us to hit the Interstate. Following more signs, more turns and bends, I eventually found our way to I-240, which would take us out to I-40, our roadway to Nashville so we could take I-65 north.<br />
But like so many well-laid plans, we had problems &#8230; traffic. No, not rush hour traffic, construction traffic. And was it heavy! A dead snail could move faster than we did. We only needed to cover two to three miles until the traffic cleared up, but that alone took nearly 45 minutes. When the traffic did finally clear up, we gunned the engine and made some distance between us and the traffic, even though the construction zone extended nearly all the way to the I-40 turn-off.<br />
Once we were on I-40, everything became smooth sailing. But we were hungry. All our touring that morning and into the afternoon had left us rather famished. The great discussion of what to eat engaged again, and for nearly 15 minutes we pulled for our personal choices. Finally, Rebecca&#8217;s craving for chicken won out, and we stopped just outside Jackson for Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br />
I am convinced KFC was not discovered by Colonel Sanders, but by the Devil himself. It&#8217;s the only theory that makes some sense to me. Think about it: how else can something taste so good, yet be so disgustingly greasy. Everyone I know readily admits that KFC is greasy &#8212; you can almost wring it out with your hands, if it was possible to get a grip on it. Yet everyone gets cravings for it every so often. I do, but I try not to eat the stuff because the thought of all that grease makes me sick to my stomach.<br />
It had been nearly three years since the last time I had eaten Kentucky Fried Chicken, and my memories of that experience were none too pleasant. Yet when I stepped inside the restaurant doors, the craving started. And it got worse with every microsecond I stood waiting for someone to buy the chicken. The next thing I knew, I had bought into the bucket of chicken, and was anxiously awaiting our meal. But first we had to find a rest stop.<br />
Just our luck: we had nearly 30 miles until the next rest stop came up. We found a nice picnic table (complete with a small roof), took out our bucket of greasy chicken, a pile of paper towels, and promptly started messily masticating our meal. I started feeling kind of ill after a while, the grease was overwhelming. I had it all over my hands and on a good portion of my face. I don&#8217;t know how I did that, but it always seemed to happen when eating KFC.<br />
All but four pieces were eaten. I swore then and there never to eat KFC again, for fear of turning into a giant zit. We threw out the remains of our chicken saving the last four pieces for a later date. Then it was back onto the van to continue our push north.<br />
Our plans had pretty much broken down by this point, we really didn&#8217;t have any idea where we were going. I wanted to see Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, since the route we were planning to take (the only thing we knew for certain) went right by the National Park. But what we hadn&#8217;t planned was where (if anywhere) we were going to stop. Nashville was ruled out about two minutes before we entered the city limits, we couldn&#8217;t think of any reason to stop that interested us. There we left I-40 for I-65.<br />
After enough goading on my part, I convinced someone to stop at Horse Cave, which had the nearest KOA to Mammoth Cave National Park. This, unfortunately, meant that our next (and last, as it turned out) KOA stop would be a late check-in, which Stefan absolutely hated doing by that time. I couldn&#8217;t blame him. Trying to figure out those wretched forms at that time of night was never a good thing.<br />
Just outside of Nashville, Rebecca got into another one of her talkative moods, and tried to strike up conversation by asking questions. Now remember what Rebecca is like. She doesn&#8217;t ask normal questions. No, she has to ask things like: &#8220;Do you love you parents?&#8221; &#8220;Who would your ideals parents be?&#8221; These were the questions that I responded to, because the earlier ones were ones I tried to avoid.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960501.175</strong><br />
<em>Day 11</em><br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee, I&#8217;ve been to Graceland &#8230;&#8221;<br />
All my illusions of Elvis have been shattered. Walking through a person&#8217;s home tells a lot about a person. We didn&#8217;t get to see the red shag and gold lamp decor, but what we did see spoke volumes. I actually thought I could see him wandering about as I walked his halls. There&#8217;s a spirit there, and it&#8217;s oddly welcoming.<br />
We traveled through the mansion listening to a pre-recorded audio tour, then onto the car museum, personal effects, a short movie, and his airplanes. I found it interesting that he and I shared a similar taste in movies.<br />
After a rather nasty traffic jam (following a run to the airport), we stopped for KFC (a bad idea, if you ask me). Rebecca&#8217;s currently asking us questions like: &#8220;If you could be born to different parents, would you?&#8221;, and &#8220;What one thing in your life would you say defines who you are?&#8221; Next step &#8211; who knows?<br />
Almost forgot &#8211; Elvis&#8217; uncle Vester was waiting for us when we returned from the tour of the Lisa Marie. He was selling cook books. Never before have I seen such a sullen man.<br />
Also discussed relationships &#8211; why is it so hard to have a simple relationship? Why do I always reach comfortable friendship so fast?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither Dhar, nor Stefan, nor myself had any complaints about our parents. The three of us had led childhoods we were proud of, with many fond memories and nothing we truly regretted. Rebecca&#8217;s childhood, on the other hand, wasn&#8217;t all fun and games. Her parents divorced, her father isn&#8217;t exactly what she (or I, for that matter) would call &#8220;role model material&#8221;, and she had a less-than-loving environment. This brought up the next round of questions: ideal parents.<br />
This was a question I honestly didn&#8217;t know how to answer. All along I believed that my parents would have been an ideal choice, assuming I had the luxury of choosing the ones I wanted. They gave me freedoms most of my friends didn&#8217;t have, taught me the ways of life, tried to get me to do extracurricular activities so that I wouldn&#8217;t be socially inept. (Okay, so they went about it a little half-assed, but I still think I turned out okay &#8230; &#8216;course, I&#8217;m still single &#8230; I&#8217;m a geek &#8230; hmm, maybe I need to think about this a little more.)<br />
Rebecca&#8217;s ideal parents would be Cher or Madonna, and Donald Trump. Although Rebecca didn&#8217;t have those people as her parents, in a strange way you could see it as being true. Rebecca has Cher&#8217;s independence and strength to keep going on (not to mention a healthy dose of sex appeal), but also Trump&#8217;s tenacity to get things done and not give a damn what someone else says about what she does.<br />
I couldn&#8217;t answer Rebecca&#8217;s question about defining moments, though I did think long and hard about it. My last couple years of high school were probably the most formative for me, at least in respects to the person I am now, but no one single point took me in the ultimate direction I&#8217;m headed now. My defining points have all been like course corrections, steering me through the straits of depression, the mountains of joy, the rivers of success, and the sandy beaches full of women I&#8217;m too shy to approach.<br />
If anything, Rebecca makes you think, whether you like it or not. Rebecca also strayed into the subject of relationships. We spent a lot of time there. Most of it was Dhar, Stefan, and I arguing the point that women are aloof, and men are stupid.<br />
Allow me to explain: we (the men) have this perception that women send &#8220;signals&#8221; to indicate their intentions. Even I have had this happen to me, and I&#8217;ll tell you something right now: I never saw it. When men are interested in women, we become the most goofy things on the planet &#8230; but we&#8217;re obvious, kind of like tossing a cat into a dog show. But when a woman finds a man attractive, she wants the man to say something first and goes about sending these &#8220;signals&#8221; to him.<br />
Every roommate I have ever had, and most of my male friends (who&#8217;ve had girlfriends and discussed the matter with me) have all confessed to not knowing that his girlfriend liked him until upwards of four months later. Most men would try for about two hours before giving up, then go home and jerk off. Women believe they&#8217;re easy to understand. As a man, I will testify that I will never understand women &#8230; they&#8217;re too confusing. And girls, if you want a blunt piece of advise when trying to hook that illusive man &#8212; beat him over the head with it. Men are dense, we will not notice your advances unless you make us look for them. It&#8217;s like walking into a room blindfolded and being told there&#8217;s a contact lens to be found. You need to show us where you dropped it.<br />
Rebecca disagreed with us. From her point of view, it was women who were easy to understand, and men who were complicated. From her point of view, I could see this happening. But as a man, I can safely say there are only three things that a guy needs to keep him happy: sleep, sustenance, and sex &#8230; the 3 S&#8217;s. (The &#8220;sustenance&#8221; category comprises food, drink (including all alcoholic beverages), violent computer games, a large screen TV, and a sports car that needs constant work.) Believe me, men are not complicated. No assembly required. Batteries not needed.<br />
Next thing I knew, I was floored with the nearly subliminal announcement that Rebecca was bisexual. I&#8217;m not sure what exactly brought that subject around, but I did have to ask a carefully worded question to make sure I heard what I thought I heard. I did.<br />
Now don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I have nothing against Rebecca, I have no different a view of her now than I did before she told me of her bisexuality &#8230; although I think I do respect her a little more now. She was very frank about it &#8212; neither positive nor negative, just another aspect of her colourful life.<br />
With that turn of events, I dropped out of the conversation for a while, to ponder on a few things. Bisexuality has always been a topic of interest for me, although I really don&#8217;t know why. Over the years I&#8217;ve developed a few theories about it &#8212; not about blame, or why &#8220;sexually deviant&#8221; practices are &#8220;bad&#8221;, but why they occur. Most of my theories are as of yet incomplete, but I have one that I think about regularly: women are more likely to engage in homosexual situations than men.<br />
This is not an accusation, nor is this truth &#8230; it is a theory. But it&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve based on experience and observation. (No, I have not been renting porno flicks.) Women are more in touch with themselves and their emotions. Women are raised to be caring and tender with themselves, their friends, and their families. Men, on the other hand, have historically been raised in a very aloof manner, where the only accepted form of contact has been the handshake.<br />
It is this very reason that led me to my theory. But over the past couple of years, that theory has become more and more clouded, as new evidence begins to tarnish my well polished idea. If my theory were true, and men were aloof to one another, I wouldn&#8217;t be wondering if I&#8217;m bisexual. This is yet another theory that I have yet to put to the test. (On a similar note, I could also say that I may not be heterosexual, since I haven&#8217;t put that to the test either.)<br />
For nearly the remainder of the distance to Bucksnort, Kentucky, I sat there debating the issues with myself. Was I what I thought I was? Could I do what I thought I might? Could I think tongue twisters and not screw them up? These were the questions that occupied me until we saw the road sign for Bucksnort.<br />
Dhar, who was driving, and I, who was riding shotgun, nearly laughed ourselves to death. For nearly ten miles after seeing the sign we giggled, laughed, snorted, howled, and guffawed. I so desperately wanted to turn around and drive back to take a picture of the sign, just to prove that someone had the guts to name a town &#8220;Bucksnort&#8221;.<br />
Somewhere between 21:00 and 22:00, we arrived in Horse Cave, Kentucky. It was a small, desolate looking place, the only feature that seemed noteworthy was the KOA we were looking for. It was buried about 1,000 feet from I-65 in a grove of tall pine trees. It looked rather picturesque, even though we couldn&#8217;t see the campground for the RVs &#8212; the trees were too dense.<br />
Stefan did his thing and signed us into a spot that was right next to the KOA office, a convenience for using the bathroom. I jumped out and hooked us up, and we proceeded to make our dinner. Digging into the last of the food meant salsa and chips, and the last of the KFC (from which I abstained). The salsa jar fell over while we were eating, staining the carpet in the depressed section of the floor. A quick hosing down prevented a major disaster, but still required a hefty dose of carpet cleaner when we got home.<br />
One of the camper spots across the driving path from us contained a couple whom we though were the campground managers. We assumed this from the woman&#8217;s vigil, staring at us to see what we were up to. After a while we drew the front curtains so we didn&#8217;t have to worry about her any longer. (Though I almost expected that action to prompt the woman to walk over to our van and start asking really stupid questions.)<br />
We almost seemed to know what the next day would bring, and we didn&#8217;t stay up late. It was the first night since Colorado Springs that we turned in early. As we lay there, a slight rumbling of thunder rolled across the sky, quickly followed by a spring rain. I fell asleep listening to the light pattering of falling water.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Aside from a good laugh at Bucksnort (who the hell names a town <em>Bucksnort</em>?), we arrived at Horse Cave without incident. Tomorrow we&#8217;ll probably hit Mammoth Cave and head again towards home.<br />
More and more I believe Dhar leads a very sheltered life. Sex is just a topic he doesn&#8217;t want to talk about &#8230; that and the letter &#8216;Y&#8217; for some strange reason.<br />
Found out Rebecca&#8217;s bisexual. Still wonder if I am &#8211; won&#8217;t know for sure for a while, but either way, [I] really don&#8217;t care. Sex is still one of those annoyingly illusive things.<br />
More and more I think women are like the unasked question: you know there&#8217;s a solution to the question, but you&#8217;re afraid to ask because then you look stupid. Men on the other hand are like an old truth -Why? Because.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Despite Dhar&#8217;s snoring, I had a fairly decent sleep that night. As was our habit, the first order of business was a shower. Dhar was one step ahead of me, something I gathered by the sound of running water from the bathroom and the empty cot in the middle of the floor.<br />
The couch wasn&#8217;t as comfortable as I thought it would be when I had gone to bed, but I was too lazy at the time to bother setting up my cot. I had escaped the bane of all couch-sleepers &#8212; the kinked neck &#8212; a fluke in retrospect. The seats were springy enough, yet one never knows what a night of tossing a turning will bring. I did have a nasty case of &#8220;fabric face&#8221; though.<br />
When Dhar emerged from the bathroom, I took his place and prepared to wash up for another long day. Or so went the intention &#8230; in practice my goal was a little more difficult. My shower started off okay, but less than 30 seconds into it (fortunately before I put any shampoo in my hair) the water turned ice cold. Then it flipped to scalding hot. Then back to ice cold. This pattern went on for a couple of minutes while I waited at the other end of the bathtub to see if it would stop. But the temperature fluctuations didn&#8217;t stop, and I ended up forgoing on a shower that morning. I made a feeble attempt to at least partially make up for the deficit by meticulously washing my face in the sink.<br />
Dhar had a smile a kilometre wide when I exited the bathroom. He asked me if I liked the shower. The bastard hadn&#8217;t warned me! He&#8217;d let me wander into the shower that morning and burn my skin off while freezing my gonads. So when Stefan and Rebecca emerged from their room a few minutes later, I didn&#8217;t tell them either&#8230;<br />
They found out quickly enough. Rebecca yipped and yelped as the water shifted from flaming to frigid. Expecting a verbal barrage when they emerged, I was rather surprised to hear only: &#8220;That shower sucks,&#8221; as they disappeared into their room. The door closed behind them and silence returned to the room.<br />
Dhar and I set about cleaning up our mess, all the while wondering how a hotel that normally charged $150 a night for our room could have such a shitty plumbing system. I began to question the hotel, thinking that perhaps this was their doing, in revenge for the discount we were getting. Although I put the thought out of my mind (I really couldn&#8217;t see that kind of thing happening), I had nagging doubts all day long. So did we all.<br />
The cameras came out early, I wanted to briefly become a pain-in-the-neck and take a surprise photo. Dhar had been like that for a good portion of the trip, catching us just as we were waking up, while we were driving, anytime that was awkward for the subject of the picture. But Dhar got the essence of what we were, no preparedness for the picture. On other trips I had taken, such a tactic was characteristic of me. I had lost the technique over the years, not having taken many pictures. It was time to start again.<br />
I stood outside the bedroom door and focused my camera on the door. I didn&#8217;t know who was going to come out first so I tried to aim approximately where either Stefan or Rebecca&#8217;s head could be. I held my camera in place and starting talking with Dhar again, not looking in the direction of the closed door. After a few minutes of patient waiting, the door opened and my finger snapped down on the shutter button. It was only after I looked towards the doorway that I realized I had taken a picture of Stefan.<br />
The plan was simple: we were going to see a plantation, specifically Oak Alley. It was just a matter of finding the place. Unfortunately we had misplaced the brochure I had obtained from the KOA office the day before. A complete search of our hotel room and Rebecca&#8217;s purse (where we believed the brochure to be) turned up nothing. Since we had to travel in that general direction anyway (that much I knew), we considered a brief stop at the KOA a good idea.<br />
We packed all our gear together and loaded up to head downstairs and check out. Our semi-dramatic entrance less than 24 hours earlier was being played in reverse, a rag-tag team of four university students exiting from a posh hotel looking almost like we should be living in the streets. I think we all took a little pride in that, our way of telling those who&#8217;d turn their noses at us that we really didn&#8217;t give a damn.<br />
The Behemoth was waiting when we got out to the road, one of the joys of valet service. The bags were stowed, the books stashed, the CD player returned to its place of honour, and the fridge checked to make sure it was still cold. I had made certain the day before that the 12 volt system was switched on and the fridge was set for 12 volt. The battery was nearly dead, but the fridge was cold. This meant our breakfast of donuts, leftovers from the previous day&#8217;s breakfast, weren&#8217;t too runny.<br />
We strapped in and headed our way back to the KOA. By this time we had a pretty good feeling for driving around in New Orleans, and the maps were left on the floor. Rebecca returned to her determination to move to New Orleans. She commented that several of the homes on St. Charles Avenue would suit her nicely. (This from someone who hasn&#8217;t even paid off her school loans yet.)<br />
I had my camera handy as I drove. The sun had finally returned to the New Orleans sky, and I was determined to get some pictures of the tree canopy over St. Charles Avenue. I also took a couple pictures of the trolleys in motion. Soon we were back at Jefferson Highway and heading west. It wasn&#8217;t long before the familiar red and yellow KOA sign appeared around a bend.<br />
I pulled up next to the office while explaining to Rebecca approximately where I had found the Oak Alley brochure in the rack. She dove into the office and returned a heartbeat later, a white piece of glossy paper in hand. I felt a little guilty about taking another copy of the brochure from the KOA when we weren&#8217;t staying there, but we had stayed there one night before, and I somehow doubted that the KOA had to pay someone to stock their printed matter rack.<br />
We drove along until we got to Williams Boulevard, where we turned north towards the I-10. There was a double purpose to the trip along Williams Boulevard, which appeared only a few blocks up from Jefferson Highway &#8212; our long-sought after Starvin&#8217; Marvin. It must have appeared very strange to the staff (not to mention the patrons) to see a large camper-van pull up to the side of the road, a dark-skinned man wearing jeans dive out the side door, take a picture of the store, and dive back in the van, which promptly drives off.<br />
The instructions were reasonably simple: get on the I-10 and travel west to exit 195. We would then travel south on a road that we didn&#8217;t know the name of, which would take us to a bridge that would cross the Mississippi River. On the other side we would find Highway 18. Heading west (or north, depending on what way you think you&#8217;re pointed), you eventually come across Oak Alley.<br />
As I drove, Dhar and I chatted nonchalantly about anything that happened to come to mind. Stefan and Rebecca, however, were unusually quiet that morning. Too quiet. It sounds a little weird, I don&#8217;t deny it, but the lack of conversation from them was disconcerting. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that the escape Dhar and I had pulled had crossed the lines of decency, and they were two harrumphs past annoyed. It seemed reminiscent of the silent treatment kids give to one another in punishment. Whatever the case was, it made me uneasy.<br />
By the time we reached exit 195, Dhar and I were talking about anything just to feel somewhat normal &#8230; at least I was, I don&#8217;t know if Dhar was feeling as paranoid that morning as I. We turned down a nondescript highway towards the Mississippi River. The silence was deafening. There are times that I wish I was psychic, so I could know the thoughts of others. (At the very least, it would help with my social life &#8212; not having to guess whether or not a woman&#8217;s going to deck me simply for talking to her would be a great relief.) That morning I would have loved to know if Dhar and I would live to see the end of the day.<br />
The map on the brochure we had wasn&#8217;t to scale. We didn&#8217;t have a clue where Oak Alley was, only that somewhere along the highway (a small two lane road) we&#8217;d stumble across the old plantation. We rounded a bend in the road, and the space to the south of us opened up. Across a small field, partially obscured by three large trees, was a large red and yellow building. It looked a little out of place, but still seemed to fit in a strange sort of manner.<br />
It was the Laura plantation, recently opened to the public. It had been the only other plantation that the KOA manager had recommended. One of the reasons we didn&#8217;t go was that the manager had pointed out that the plantation had only just opened, and was still working out the bugs &#8230; not necessarily in the literal sense.<br />
Just past Laura was another large bend in the road. Along the southern side was a large line of dense trees, the northern side a steep hill. A small simple sign quickly came into view: &#8220;Oak Alley Parking 500 ft.&#8221; I breathed a silent sigh of relief, I was glad we didn&#8217;t have to backtrack on our route to find the place. In a heartbeat we could look down the feature that gave the plantation its name: an alley of 28 enormous oak trees that led to the plantation house.<br />
We pulled into the gravel driveway at the west end of the plantation lot, and traveled down the slightly winding road to the lot. We deposited the van away from most of the other cars, just so we&#8217;d have some room to maneouver when it was time to leave. The ceiling hatch was opened and the fan turned on to keep the inside cool, we grabbed whatever we thought we might need, and set off to find the main entrance.<br />
The booth was at the north-east end of the lot. Tickets were a little more expensive than most places we had been to at that point, about $8, but the cost included a guided tour of the plantation house. We left the gravel pathways and started eastwards onto an asphalt surface that looked just wide enough to handle the Behemoth and two people on either side. We walked about 100 metres to a junction with another path that ran north-south.<br />
We turned north towards the rear of the plantation manor. Although it wasn&#8217;t what I expected for a residence of the rich and powerful, there was something about it that looked oddly familiar &#8230; I just couldn&#8217;t put my finger on it. We walked along the path under a series of oak trees that looked very similar to those at the front of the house, but smaller in size.<br />
As we approached the rear, we caught sight of a young African-American woman dressed in a period gown, assumedly based on the type of clothes the women house slaves wore when the plantation was in operation. She smiled and bade us a cheerful &#8220;hello&#8221;, which Dhar promptly returned for the rest of us. She was to be our tour guide, and directed us to the front of the house to wait for a bell that would alert us to the next tour of the manor house.<br />
Around the front, the sheer size of the oak trees became very apparent. The constant growth over the years had created branches so heavy that tall metal poles supported the huge boughs, and steel rods were inserted through the trees to keep them from falling apart. The cover over the pathway that ran down the middle of the two rows of 14 trees was so complete, hardly any sunlight reached through. At the other end of the pathway was the wrought iron fence, Highway 18, and the steep hill. It wasn&#8217;t until later that we found out that the hill was one of the levees for the Mississippi River.<br />
I walked halfway up the path and dug out my panoramic camera to catch part of the view of the front of this magnificent building. As I took the picture, that strange feeling of familiarness came over me again. I had seen that shot before somewhere, but I honestly couldn&#8217;t remember where.<br />
Dhar was strolling through the gardens, looking at whatever he happened to come across. Stefan and Rebecca waited with many other people for the bell to ring. The bell was a large rocker bell, mounted on the east side of the house with a rope that ran to the second level. Shortly before the bell finally rung, our tour guide asked for us to sign the guest registry, a formality I hardly saw necessary. I could hardly see the banal quotes and signatures of use unless you happened to be famous.<br />
The bell rung as I was signing, and the tour guide asked us to go to the rear of the house, where the tour would start. The tour guide walked through the middle of the house and opened the door from the inside. Stepping through the door activated a time machine that catapulted us two hundred years into the past &#8212; a past where man enslaving man was normal, electricity was unheard of, chivalry thrived, and the Mississippi River was America&#8217;s Interstate.<br />
The house had three floors, of which we saw two (Louisiana law governing emergency fire exits prevented us from seeing the third floor). The two floors we did see both had high ceilings, anywhere from 15 to 20 feet (I&#8217;m not very good at judging heights). The plan of the floors was simple: a central hallway that ran from the front door (directly in line with the front pathway that ran between the two rows of oak trees) to the back door (directly in line with the rear pathway that ran between the two rows of smaller oak trees). (You could, in effect, see from the rear path all the way to the Mississippi River looking through the house.) At the &#8220;rear&#8221; end of the hallway was the staircase, running from almost halfway up the hall right to the rear wall.<br />
The house was massive, although you really couldn&#8217;t tell unless you looked very hard. And I don&#8217;t mean massive in the sense of &#8220;largeness&#8221;, but in sense of strength. The architects had known that hurricanes were prone to passing through the area, and many homes were regularly destroyed by such storms. The Oak Alley plantation manor was built with five-foot thick brick walls to withstand the storms.<br />
But even a house that massive had the amenity of windows. In fact, all the windows were strategically placed across from each other through doorways. The result was that all the windows could be opened and wind could pass straight through the house to keep it cool during the summers.<br />
Immediately to our left (on the west side of the hallway) was a small drawing room, furnished with a couple chairs, a desk, and a few lamps. The decor looked like Sherlock Holmes&#8217; study. The small room took up roughly a third of the usable space on the west side of the house, yet was barely 20 feet square.<br />
Between the drawing room and the next doorway were a couple linen closets, called &#8220;hidden rooms&#8221;. Behind the shelves were rooms that hadn&#8217;t seen any light in a hundred years. One of the previous owners of Oak Alley used to hold private discussions of politics and life with his friends in the rooms &#8230; and no women were allowed. Naturally the practice led to smoking and over-drinking. Eventually his wife could take no more and had the rooms sealed.<br />
Just to side of one of the closets was a small glass case containing some of the pages from the guest registry, some bearing gold stars indicating the celebrities who had visited the historic home. Some of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest names had walked in the same spots as we were walking, including Brad Pitt. It was when I read his name it dawned upon me where that feeling of familiarity was coming from. By now, you may also know. (For those of you who still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m babbling about, please allow me to enlighten you. In 1993, the Anne Rice novel Interview With The Vampire was filmed on location at Oak Alley. The opening flashbacks of the movie tell the story of Louis&#8217; life in New Orleans, and his mansion is Oak Alley.)<br />
The next room on the west side of the hallway was the sitting room, what we would call a living room. It filled the remaining visible two-thirds of the western side of the first floor (remember there was a hidden room). It contained a few couches, tables, and a fireplace (which to me seemed a little out of place in Louisiana). The guide explained some of the artifacts in the room, including a chaperone&#8217;s mirror and a table with a tilting top.<br />
The chaperone&#8217;s mirror hung on the north wall, and was placed facing south. The mirror itself wasn&#8217;t flat, but curved so that someone standing out in the hallway could still see anyone in the room. It wasn&#8217;t a security device the way we use such mirrors today, but was used to keep an eye on courting couples from afar.<br />
The tilting table was a device used by women to keep the heat of the fire from melting their makeup, which they would wear for weeks at a time. Unlike today&#8217;s synthetic powders and cremes, women of the 1800&#8217;s usually wore beeswax. This was to fill in the pockmarks left by smallpox, through which many people suffered until a cure was found.<br />
Another interesting little detail that the guide pointed out was the abundance of clocks in the house, all which showed exactly the same time, which was wrong. They had all been stopped decades ago when the last owner of the house had died. Following an old southern custom, all the clocks in the house were stopped at the time of death for a period of a year. The plantation was sold before the year was up, and the clocks were never restarted.<br />
Across from the sitting room was the dining room. It had the same layout as the sitting room (not counting the furniture), except for the kitchen door on the south end. In the middle of the room was a long, ornate dining table. Above it hung a large crystal chandelier. Originally the mount from which the chandelier hung was a large fan, which had since been put on display in the south-east corner of the room. The fan looked like a large wooden music stand, without the supporting pole. The fan had once sported a leather cover, and was swung from side to side by a slave child who would stand at the side of the room, pulling on a rope.<br />
We then proceeded up the stairs to view the bedrooms. The second floor rooms followed the pattern of the first floor, two small rooms next to two larger rooms, in the ratio of 1:2 for space. The smaller rooms were for children and visiting young ladies (the young men slept outside of the manor house). Both had large beds, the south-west room was decorated in a style typically used when someone died.<br />
The largest room was the master bedroom, in the north-west corner of the second floor. It had so much furniture and decorations, it looked rather hard to move around in it. Ropes placed across the door frames prevented anyone from entering the room.<br />
We then exited through the north door to walk onto the balcony that ran right around the outside of the second floor of the house. The view of the grounds was much better, none of the hedges and bushes obstructed the view any longer.<br />
After another piece of historical information (which had something to do with where the previous owners were buried, and where the current owner lived), we went back inside through the south door. The guide then ended the tour, upon which we went back down the stairs and out through the front door.<br />
Rebecca promptly announced that she wanted a mint julep. It was Louisiana, it was a plantation, it was getting hot, and the staff were selling them at the rear of the house. I didn&#8217;t know what a mint julep was, other than it was primarily a southern cocktail of some sort, and James Bond drank one in Goldfinger. It&#8217;s mostly straight bourbon with a shot of mint syrup for flavour. It&#8217;s a devilishly simple drink, and damn strong. I had only a sip, but could taste it for hours afterwards.<br />
While Rebecca sipped on her julep, we walked down the rear path under the 150 year-old oak trees (a bit of information we received on the tour &#8212; the trees out front were over 300 years old, and no-one really know who planted them) heading to the southern areas of the plantation. Soon we ended up at the gift shop. Nearby were the bed and breakfast bungalows.<br />
Inside were various pictures, postcards, mugs, hats, t-shirts, cookbooks, spices &#8230; nearly everything you could think of, packed into the neat little shop without it looking cluttered. I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for purchasing anything, so I made use of the toilet instead. Rebecca bought a cookbook.<br />
By that time, the sun was out in full force and the chill had been eradicated. Suddenly the thing to do was to sit in the middle of the vast grass lawns and lay in the warmth. This didn&#8217;t last too long though &#8230; Rebecca sat on a nest of red ants, which promptly bit her in several places on her legs. On the bright side though, the bites would have hurt a lot more if she hadn&#8217;t been drinking mint julep.<br />
We were fairly near to the mysterious graves of the previous owners, so we wandered over a small wooden bridge to a heavily treed area, which surrounded the half dozen graves. I don&#8217;t know if we were expecting anything, because we certainly didn&#8217;t find anything out of the ordinary &#8230; at least for a cemetery. We didn&#8217;t stick around too long, and headed back to the Behemoth.<br />
The next step was to find our way out of Louisiana, and head towards the home of the King of Rock &#8216;n Roll &#8212; Memphis, Tennessee. In our way was Mississippi state, and a long humid drive. The van was cool (the result of the fan), and I assumed the position of navigator while Stefan drove.<br />
We doubled back on the route we had taken, pausing only once to take a picture of the front oak trees one last time before vanishing into the distance. By that time, I was feeling less worried about Stefan and Rebecca. Either they had given up making Dhar and I feel guilty for our actions, or they had just been a little tired and not in a talkative mood. In either case, I was glad we had returned to being yappy.<br />
Returning to the I-10, we proceeded east to I-55, which took us north. We passed by the west end of Lake Pontchartrain, and soon were heading towards home. Although that was a goal a couple days away still.<br />
If I had but one regret about New Orleans, it was not finding any vampires. Not that I really want to be killed by one, or turned into a demon of the night, but it was a view I got from listening to too many stories of New Orleans. Perhaps in the years to come things may change&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960430.15</strong><br />
<em>Day 10</em><br />
Did I step over my bounds, and put Dhar in a bad position? This morning was oddly quiet, almost silent. I&#8217;ve been in situations where friendship is feigned instead of confronting the problem &#8211; I pray that isn&#8217;t the case here.<br />
Dhar and I went out last night for about 2.5 hours, leaving Stef and Rebecca alone in the hotel. Dhar told me that Stef had said Rebecca would be &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; with Dhar and I leaving them alone, yet Rebecca had made allusions to a need for privacy with Stef. This I heard about after deciding that Dhar and I needed to vacate the premises for a while &#8211; both Stef and Rebecca looked like they were about to explode &#8211; they needed some release, and tip-toeing around the issue wasn&#8217;t helping any. Dhar and I may be miserably single, but we aren&#8217;t blind to the needs of couples.<br />
It just dawned on me that I feel fairly relaxed, for the first time in about a year. Even if the vacation were to end now, I would be pleased in the knowledge that I did something.<br />
This morning (after sleeping in and getting scalded by the shower), we went to Oak Alley Plantation. Rebecca got drunk on a mint julep, then bitten by red ants. On to Graceland!
</p></blockquote>
<p>My parents and I have very differing view of what a vacation is. I like to be entertained, kept interested. Plunk me on a beach for a week and I&#8217;ll go insane. Most people would consider the trip we took very stressful, and I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that it wasn&#8217;t totally smooth-flowing (few things are). But we had accomplished so much in just 10 days that I felt a sense of achievement, which gave me my much needed feeling of relaxation. (After five years of university, you start feeling relaxed when you complete big things &#8212; it&#8217;s a learned response developed from doing essays and projects for school. Take an introductory psychology course, and you&#8217;ll understand.)<br />
So as we crossed the state line into Mississippi, I no longer really cared what we did. We had seen almost everything I had wanted to see, and a lot more that I had never really planned on. I had no regrets about what we had done (except maybe the lack of vampires), and no worries about what was yet to come. We were heading for Memphis, and Graceland.<br />
It was past 18:00 when we pulled into a rest stop for a toilet run. The stop was sparsely populated (I guessed not many people travel through Mississippi and stop along the way, either that or they were at some restaurant having a generic pre-fabricated dinner), mostly trucks parked in the front portion of the rest area. Aside from a car and a pick-up that came in and left, we had the rear area to ourselves.<br />
The bathrooms were, shall we say, unique. They were the only ones we used that we would recommend replacing &#8212; there was no possible way to fix that place up enough to make it look good. Most of the inside had been covered in some kind of goop (which I didn&#8217;t want to even go near), the floors hadn&#8217;t been cleaned since the building had been erected, the windows were completely clouded (which might have been intentional, but it was hard to tell), and the only cockroach I saw had died from trying to live in that squalor. The only good point about the washroom was that the echoing made me sound like Darth Vader. Rebecca complained that the place was so bad that it even had the obligatory peephole in the women&#8217;s bathroom. Dhar mentioned that the men&#8217;s room had one too.<br />
Instead of immediately filing back into the Behemoth and hitting the Interstate again, we decided to stay and have dinner. It was an opportunity to eat the potatoes that we had been lugging around for the past 4,000 kilometres. I dug out the barbeque, lit the burner and tossed on eight of the tubers (wrapped in aluminum foil). Stefan complained about the aluminum, claiming it caused Alzheimer&#8217;s disease if it got into your blood stream. I didn&#8217;t know where he got his fact from, but I made a mental note to look into the issue (especially since all anti-perspirants use aluminum hydroxide).<br />
Baking potatoes is one of the most time consuming processes in cooking. (I now know how to cut the cooking time in half, but it didn&#8217;t help that dinner.) So while we waited for the potatoes to cook enough for us to eat them, we laid back and relaxed a little. Dhar broke out the bottle of Budwieser he had bought back in Fort Stockton, Texas. We had to take a picture of him sitting proudly with the over-sized bottle. Rebecca hopped into the picture for show.<br />
Eventually the potatoes had cooked enough so that they weren&#8217;t raw &#8230; they were burned. The barbeque was an good way to cook things, but the heat wasn&#8217;t very well distributed, resulting in over- and under-cooked food at the same time (sometimes in the same piece of whatever it was you were cooking). But I hadn&#8217;t reduced them to charcoal, which made the meal at least slightly edible.<br />
After dinner, we resumed our northerly direction towards Memphis. The trip was a fairly uneventful one &#8230; except for Rebecca&#8217;s continual attempts to strike up strange forms of conversation. (As we had crossed New Mexico, it was going through the alphabet letter-by-letter, listing off every word you could think off, and usually having a long discussion about it. &#8216;Sex&#8217; was a particularly long conversation.) She excelled and coercing people to talk, though after a while Stefan and Dhar would rebel and switch topics to cars or computers. That usually had the effect of either shutting Rebecca up, or making her want to switch the topic again. I sat on the sidelines and watched the fur fly.<br />
Rebecca wasn&#8217;t feeling too well. Our trip had been beautifully planned (though mostly by luck), we had missed nearly every major problem associated with road trips: traffic, bad weather (except in Missouri), and crowds (except in Las Vegas). The only thing we hadn&#8217;t expected was the rise in the price of gas. We also didn&#8217;t anticipate Rebecca falling under the spell of &#8220;The Curse&#8221;.<br />
All women experience PMS in different ways. Some hardly notice it. Some have to get surgery to prevent bleeding to death. Most tend to fall somewhere in the middle. Rebecca was closer the lighter end of the scale (at least from my point of view) &#8212; she could still argue, walk around, and eat. Many of my female friends have very tough periods, with cramps taking them out of service for upwards of an entire day. But cramps are cramps, and as much as men try to think that they understand, none of us have ever had to experience them. Rebecca was visibly uncomfortable. The sooner we stopped for the night, the better.<br />
There were two KOAs in Memphis, one of them was named &#8220;Graceland&#8221;. According to the maps I was looking at, it looked like it was right across the street from Elvis&#8217; Graceland, which to us would be a great advantage. So we opted for the nearer of the two campgrounds.<br />
We arrived in Memphis just after 23:00 that evening. Graceland was located in the south end of the city, so we didn&#8217;t have to spend too much time trying to navigate our way through Memphis. We exited I-55 at exit 5B, turning south onto Highway 51 &#8230; which in Memphis is known as Elvis Presley Boulevard. We drive south for about a mile before finding the KOA sign. Much to our disappointment, Graceland wasn&#8217;t across the street from the KOA, but lay about an eighth of a mile further south.<br />
It was cool in Memphis, the air mass that had cooled off New Orleans the day before had obviously gone through Memphis on its way south. Stefan hopped out of the van and went through the rigmarole of signing all the forms, dotting his &#8216;T&#8217;s and crossing his &#8216;I&#8217;s. Even before that was done, Rebecca and Dhar set out to find the restrooms and see if they were locked. This produced who I assumed to be the KOA manager, who seemed a little peeved about us showing up at 22:15 at night.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca appeared after a few minutes, proudly (but quietly) proclaiming the bathroom doors were unlocked. Stefan finished all the drudgery of the KOA paperwork at the same moment, and we drove the van our to our campsite for the evening. Unlike our previous sites, we had opted for a basic camping site with no hook-ups. They way we saw it, all we were interested in was sleep. No dishes, no electricity, nothing fancy at all. The fridge was nearly empty, hence nothing perishable, and could last the night on the 12 volt system.<br />
After we parked, I made my run to make use of the facilities. I still find it rather surprising just how little we actually stopped for toilet breaks &#8212; maybe a little over a dozen times in the entire trip (not counting stops for meals). We often managed to hold out for long periods of time. Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t so much my surprise at the entire group, but also Rebecca. I know it sounds sexist, but all my experience seems to point to women have small bladders. (And children, but we didn&#8217;t have any with us.) My mother is particularly bad. (My parents have a three month journey planned for the Behemoth starting in mid-September. I can only imagine how often they&#8217;ll be stopping.)</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
It&#8217;s about 23:20, and we&#8217;re settling in for the night. Rebecca&#8217;s got cramps, Dhar seems to be depressed about something, Stef and I don&#8217;t want to go home too early, and our site doesn&#8217;t have any hook-ups. Okay &#8217;nuff complaining.The silence issues may have been from a simple case of exhaustion &#8211; and I seemed to the only one completely awake. I can only hope Dhar got enough sleep [last night], or I&#8217;m going to tape his mouth shut and make breathe through his nose!

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The morning was sunny and humid, much like the day before. We awoke between 08:00 and 08:30 following a long and comfortable night&#8217;s sleep. Showers were the order of the morning, to prepare oneself for the long day ahead. We had planned to execute the steps of Rebecca&#8217;s master plan to conquer the world &#8230; starting with New Orleans. A plantation tour and a visit to the swamps were main directives.<br />
Several RVs and campers were packing up, preparing to travel to their homes in some distant state or country. Dhar hadn&#8217;t yet returned from his venture of the night, but we knew he soon would. Vampire or not, we had all his clothes.<br />
The shower was inviting, I felt rather invigorated. Not a particularly active morning person, I&#8217;ve found a good morning shower as effective for me as coffee is for others. However, my morning was to take a minor plunge when I returned to the van. I found, much to my horror, I was out of underwear. I had managed to stretch my week&#8217;s worth of clothing to almost nine days (remember that I two of those nine days were virtually extensions of two others, effectively making seven days), but I had finally reached the end of the line.<br />
Dhar entered the van a moment later, carrying a small box of laundry detergent. (I hadn&#8217;t noticed the return of the Neon on my way back to the van.) The verdict seemed to be unanimous. It was laundry day. Dhar had purchased the small box of soap for everyone, which really made a lot of sense. There was no way we were going to be washing again before the trip was over, so might as well use all that we could. Dhar had already started his wash.<br />
I gathered all my spent clothes together (already contained in plastic grocery bags) along with my towel and bathing suit. I intended to wash all the clothes I could, so for a couple of hours that morning, I wore only a t-shirt and my fleece shorts &#8212; all my underwear went in the wash. It was a bit drafty without a layer underneath, but in the warmth of south Louisiana, you really don&#8217;t notice it much.<br />
The laundry house was about 15 metres away from the van, a short walk around a couple of nearby RVs. Entering through the east end, the room contained washing machines to the left and right of the doors, and a double bank of dryers at the opposite end. A short line of chairs rested on the right side of the room where there were less washing machines. The solitary occupant was an elderly man, undoubtedly washing his clothes.<br />
I dumped the entire contents of the bags into a single washing machine, not bothering to separate colours. I hadn&#8217;t brought anything that hadn&#8217;t already been washed a million times &#8212; bleeding colours wasn&#8217;t really much of a concern for me. I sprinkled in a few mounds of soap, shook it into the gaps between the shirts and shorts, then throwing in a last handful for good measure. I clapped in the $1.00 washing fee (all quarters) into the pull slot and sent the industrial washer into high gear.<br />
Figuring on about 40 minutes to wash my clothes, I took the opportunity to get a few chores done. First on my list was to call home. I had told my mother I would call when I got to Texas. Unfortunately, we had passed rather quickly through that state, and I missed my chance to report home. A phone nearby the laundry house fit the bill.<br />
Mother still hadn&#8217;t found my health insurance, but I wasn&#8217;t too concerned by that point. She asked how the trip was going and how well we were holding out. I kept the call fairly short for two reasons: 1) I didn&#8217;t want to talk too long during the day, and 2) I didn&#8217;t want to have to answer a lot of questions I&#8217;d have to answer again when I got home. (This is another reason why I write this. If you asked me how the trip was, you undoubtedly got directed here.)<br />
As I hung up, I felt a few drops of rain fall on me. I looked up into the sky, noticing that a few clouds were beginning to fill the sky. I headed back to the van to make sure that nothing got wet. Dhar was sitting at the picnic table next to the van, writing postcards to his family. I asked him how his night had been. Trouble found Dhar yet again.<br />
Having dropped us off, he had driven back downtown again to see what else he could do. He went into a bar (assumedly to have a drink or two) and was promptly discovered by a group of our fellow countrymen, in various states of intoxication. This wasn&#8217;t the bad part. That came about when one of the group announced, rather loudly, that Americans don&#8217;t know how to party. Dhar wanted to crawl under a rock. I would too in that situation.<br />
I take objection to putting down the residents of any one country without good reason. Given, Americans tend to be looked down on by many Canadians for various reasons (some are rather insipid or meaningless), but that didn&#8217;t give those fools any reason to spout their mouths off like that. They, like us, were guests of our gracious hosts, and one does not want to offend one&#8217;s host. Especially if there are more of them.<br />
Following his tangle in the bars of Bourbon Street, Dhar drove around for quite some time to use up as much gasoline as he could. In doing so he drove three-quarters of the way to Baton Rouge and back (a trip of about 120 miles). Still having well over a quarter of a tank of gas remaining, he toured New Orleans until returning to the campground.<br />
I decided to take after Dhar and write some more postcards home. I wandered across the campground lawn, crossed the road and entered the KOA office just as Rebecca was leaving, acknowledging each other in passing. One of the male KOA staff, whom I assumed to be the manager, was looking at Rebecca as she left the building, shaking his head. He asked of me:<br />
&#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s a natural thing, or do they do that on purpose?&#8221;<br />
(He was referring to way women&#8217;s hips tend to swing as they walk.) I promptly answered: &#8220;With her, it&#8217;s sometimes hard to tell.&#8221; (There are many long stories that go into that statement, and none of them are going to be repeated here. Suffice to say, this was neither an insult or a &#8220;factual statement&#8221;. It was a ribbing if anything. Had Rebecca heard me, she would&#8217;ve returned the favour.) The two of us laughed a little, then I got down to business. I grabbed four postcards, trying not to spend too much time in selecting them, and bought four 40 cent stamps to get my messages home.<br />
As I finished paying for my message medium, I started probing the man for information. We had plans to do some visiting that day, and I figured enough tourists came through the KOA in a year to make the staff reasonably knowledgeable in the right places to see. I asked the man what was the best plantation to see, and which swamp tour came most recommended.<br />
Barely skipping a breath: &#8220;If you go to a plantation, everyone&#8217;ll ask ya which one ya went to, and everyone&#8217;ll ask if it was that one,&#8221; he said, pointing his finger to a rack of pamphlets next to the door. I had to ask for clarification as to which one he was referring to. &#8220;Oak Alley. Most famous one of all.&#8221; Following his pointing and reading the titles carefully, I found the illusive white booklet near the top. The picture on the front looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out why.<br />
As far as swamp tours were concerned, we just had to keep in mind how much we wanted to pay, how far into the swamps we were willing to go, and so on and so on. I was appraised of one particular tour guide who only did the tours at night, looking like someone who had decayed in the swamp for several years. He picked up his passengers in a hearse and took them deep into the swamp where he would scare the hell out of them. Goes to show you, people are stupid.<br />
Taking the advise and thanking the manager for his time, I returned to the van to get ready to finish off my laundry. I figured that enough time had passed that the wash would be ready to dry. The old man was still sitting in his chair when I entered the laundry room. My machine, closest to the dryers on the right side of the room, was still going. With no visible timer built into the machine, there was no way to tell how long until it was all dry.<br />
I left and returned a few minutes later, this time with more success. I opened the clear plastic door of one of the upper dryers (they were stacked in twos) and plopped in the 50 cent drying fee. I was about to close the door when I realized I had no fabric softener sheets. Knowing I&#8217;d end up buying more than I needed, I shut the door and dealt with slightly rough clothes for the rest of the trip.<br />
About 40 minutes later my mostly dry clothes emerged. Like many laundromat dryers that I&#8217;d used over the years, these didn&#8217;t do a perfect job, coming just shy of where they needed to be. But dry enough for me. I packed the lot into the two grocery bags that I&#8217;d brought them out in and returned to the van to sort the lot out. The first order of business was underwear, the constant draft was becoming disconcerting. I packed the dry clothes in my backpack, and laid the slightly less dry clothes out in the diminishing sun to finish drying.<br />
I had thought earlier the clouds were going away. But more and more poured in from the north. It looked like rain. Dhar thought so too. As if on cue, the manager appeared at our side door and pronounced exactly what we were thinking. He then suggested that we skip the swamp tours. Apparently when it rained, everything one wants to see in a swamp disappears until the sun comes back out and dries everything off.<br />
But like Cliff Clavin, he just couldn&#8217;t stop with that one fact. He immediately jumped into how much rainfall New Orleans received in an average storm. I&#8217;d heard about the rain briefly from my friend Chris, who had visited New Orleans a few years earlier on a music trip (not unlike the one featured in [[Music Trip to Orlando, Introduction|Music Trip to Orlando]]). But we had yet to experience it&#8230;<br />
The rain, so the man was telling us, comes like an orgasm: quick, short, hot, and wet. In fact, so much rain falls in an average rain storm that New Orleans installed a series of pumps to get the roads dried out as quickly as possible. Each of these pumps empties the equivalent of a swimming pool of water every second. (That&#8217;s about 35,000 gallons, or 133,000 litres.) There are 38 of these pumps, each generating a spout of water over 10 feet across. Needless to say, Dhar and I were duly impressed.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca returned from the office, and everyone agreed we needed food. Normally, we would be out touring or on the road to our next destination, having eaten breakfast. But we had tapped the last of our breakfast food the day before. Stefan and Dhar volunteered to find some donuts for us to eat, and promptly drove off in the Neon.<br />
Not long afterwards, the clouds began to start shedding some of their moisture. Not a lot of it, most just a few sprinklings, but enough to cause me to starting bringing in the towels and clothes that had been sitting in the sun. The clouds kept getting denser and denser, blocking out more and more of the sun with each passing minute. We were going to experience a New Orleans downpour, but we didn&#8217;t know when.<br />
I informed Rebecca about the problems with seeing the swamp in the rain. She looked a little dejected, but agreed that we would be better off in sunnier conditions. This left the door open for more touring of the city. (Visiting a plantation in the rain would be just as bad as the swamp &#8212; but it would be us wanting to disappear into shelter.)</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960429.1125</strong><br />
<em>Day 9</em><br />
Today we&#8217;re heading for a hotel, then downtown for some fun. Did my laundry this morning, which is good &#8216;cuz I ran out of underwear last night. Expecting a torrential downpour today.<br />
Dhar and Stef are off getting donuts for breakfast / lunch &#8230; brunch?<br />
Had an interesting conversation with the manager &#8211; regarding the swinging hips of the fairer sex, he making a specific reference to Rebecca &#8211; I think only because he realized we know each other. It&#8217;s hot, it&#8217;s humid and I&#8217;ve got an acne breakout.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Checkout for us was at noon. Stefan and Dhar took a significant amount of time in returning to us with our breakfast (rapidly becoming lunch), arriving at 11:45. They claimed a great deal of trouble in finding a donut shop, eventually finding one not too far from the KOA.<br />
On a whole, American donuts don&#8217;t quite match up to Tim Horton&#8217;s, a cornerstone of Canadian cuisine. Most tend to be rather dense, crumbly, dry, and bland. But the donuts that Dhar and Stefan found (for a surprisingly low price, only about $2) were a taste of home &#8230; with about four times the amount of sugar. Never before had I eaten a donut that made my heart palpitate from the level of sucrose. Not that I was complaining, they were damn good.<br />
We ate hastily, not wanting to overstay our welcome at the campground. The uneaten donuts were crammed into the fridge, and we set about unhooking the Behemoth from the city utilities and preparing to hit the road. When we were ready to leave, Dhar jumped in the Neon while Stefan, Rebecca, and I drove the van.<br />
We had decided on a hotel on the north side of the Garden District, about two miles from the French Quarter. In a map that Rebecca had taken from the KOA office the day before (the maps were free), we found a coupon for a one-night stay at the Avenue Plaza Suite Hotel and Eurovita Spa. (Long name, eh?) The usual price for the room was well over $100, but the coupon knocked the price to $50.<br />
We pulled out onto Jefferson Highway and started heading east. Almost immediately we lost Dhar in the traffic, but in a matter of seconds he appeared just inches off our rear bumper. Actually, he appeared then disappeared as he approached our rear bumper &#8212; the Neon was so short that I couldn&#8217;t see him through the rear window.<br />
Our view along Jefferson Highway was unimpeded by night, the &#8220;urbanness&#8221; of the area was rather plain given the city&#8217;s downtown decor. We listened to a local radio station as we drove, it was only the second time we listened to the radio since leaving home. The music was &#8220;new rock&#8221;, which is essentially a blend of rock &#8216;n roll and alternative styles. The radio station seemed to be populated by some rather interesting people, as was indicated by their self-promotion:<br />
<q>&#8220;Broadcasting live from a concrete warehouse somewhere between two cow pastures!&#8221;</q>We drove along Jefferson Highway until we reached Carrollton Avenue. Here we turned right to head south towards the Mississippi River. Down the centre of Carrollton Avenue runs one of the lines of the famous New Orleans trolley cars. Extending over Carrollton Avenue was a spectacular canopy of trees, forming a flora tunnel. Both the trolleys and the trees ran along most of the length of Carrollton Avenue, and continued along St. Charles Avenue.<br />
The sky above us had by now completely obscured the sun. The wind had picked up a little, and the temperature dropped. As we reached the elbow of Carrollton Avenue (where it turns into St. Charles Avenue), we saw a wall of wind come over a small hill next to the river. The wind carried leaves, small twigs, large drops of water, and the odd small animal. The Behemoth rocked slightly to the left as we turned the corner.<br />
A moment later, the rain started. Under the continuing canopy of trees the rain wasn&#8217;t as pronounced, but when we entered one of the gaps the full force of the rain could be seen and felt. The storm we had experienced driving through Missouri was the only thing I could think of that even remotely came close to that kind of deluge.<br />
We had a distance of about three and a half miles to cover before we arrived at the hotel. During that time we passed by some of the most awesome architecture in houses that I&#8217;d ever seen. Rebecca and Stefan came to the conclusion that they were going to move to New Orleans and live in the area. I stifled a laugh. We passed by Tulane University and Loyola University about a third of the way along St. Charles Avenue, which only strengthened Rebecca&#8217;s desire to move. She started wondering what graduate programs they had.<br />
As we passed Jackson Avenue, our hotel appeared on the north side of the road. Parking was at a premium in the area, so we pulled into the first available side street so Rebecca and Stefan could get us checked in. I had to park in a no parking zone (next to a fire hydrant), and Dhar pulled in on the opposite side of the street.<br />
The rain seemed to fall in millions of continuous streams, causing the streets to look like shallow rivers. I switched off the windshield wipers but kept the engine running in case I had to make a hasty exit. I stared at the flowing water, listening to the radio while waiting for the verdict to come from inside. And I waited. And waited. And waited. It took less time for me to sign into Treasure Island and have the four of us move into room.<br />
After over 15 minutes, Stefan sprinted from around the corner of the hotel and entered the side door of the van. The hotel management hadn&#8217;t believed the coupon at first, and only after a lot of wrangling with Rebecca did they give in. I was to drive around front so we could bring all our stuff inside. Stefan then ran over to Dhar to tell him the same.<br />
Having parked on a one-way road, I had to drive around the block until I was driving west on St. Charles Avenue, allowing me to easily pull into the front of the hotel. We made quick work of pulling all our necessary stuff out, trying to stay as dry as possible. When I went around to the rear door (where my backpack was stored), I found that the edge of the road had four inches of water coursing towards the street grating.<br />
If we had looked a little odd walking into Treasure Island, we put a sore thumb to shame walking into the Avenue Plaza Suite Hotel. The decor was white marble, gold trim, with mahogany desks and paneling. The upper class guests frowned upon our sandals, cheap clothing, baseball caps, and backpacks as they walked outside. I felt very strange about leaving a set of keys with a valet. It wasn&#8217;t that I was afraid he&#8217;d steal anything, but it was the fact that there was no other choice than to use a valet.<br />
The Jazz Festival over until the following weekend, the hotel was mostly deserted. Our room was on the sixth floor, St. Charles Avenue west wing, north side. The room wasn&#8217;t immense, but had two beds, a table, bathroom, kitchenette, and a TV. We unceremoniously dumped our belongings about the room, made quick use of the facilities, and prepared to return outside to start making use of our afternoon.<br />
Stefan protested at first, not wanting to go out (he was a little damp from running around in the rain), but his better half told him to get his ass in gear before she threw something at him. The rain had brought a change in our plans, and we reverted to visiting the Aquarium of the Americas. It wasn&#8217;t the aquarium per se that we wanted to see, it was mostly the IMAX 3D movie that played there.<br />
The Aquarium of the Americas is at the foot of Canal Street, on the river front. We found a public parking lot nearby and deposited the Neon. By this point the rain had mostly fizzled out, leaving just a few falling drops. I was now waiting for the onslaught of the sun, which from what I had heard always came out after such a storm and dried everything out.<br />
The Aquarium building was huge. At least two American football fields in length (but probably closer to two Canadian football fields), the massive building contained both the Aquarium of the Americas and the IMAX theatre. The front of the building faced the Mississippi River, the rear faced the parking lot where we left the Neon. A long wall separated us from the Aquarium, but it ended parallel to the edge of the building anyway and wasn&#8217;t too much of a blockade.<br />
As we rounded the wall we found more trolley tracks. I hadn&#8217;t realized that New Orleans had more than one line of trolleys. Just off to the right, flush against the wall, was an enormous steel gate about three feet thick. The gate was solid (we don&#8217;t know if it was filled with anything, but I assume it was), running the height of the wall, about 10 feet. A steel track laid into the pathway running between two sections of the wall suggested that it was closed once in a while.<br />
At first I thought it was a security door, closed at night to prevent someone from stealing the fishes. A moment later, its real purpose dawned on me. I had forgotten we were next to the Mississippi River, the most notorious for flooding in North America. The thick walls and the gates were flood prevention devices. There were no visible signs (i.e. high water marks) that showed whether or not it had been put into use, but if history was any indication of the future, the water would soon rise.<br />
Just past the trolley tracks we crossed a brick courtyard. Most of the brownish-red bricks had names carved into them, undoubtedly the names of the people who had donated money to fund the Aquarium&#8217;s construction and operation. We stopped briefly at a bank machine so Dhar could try and get some money (his attempts were rather unsuccessful).<br />
As we rounded the next corner of the pseudo-rectangular building, our hopes of a peaceful visit through the complex were dashed when we found a small ocean of ankle-biters, rug rats, brats &#8230; in other words, children on field trips. Dhar slowed briefly as we walked forward. I could hear his heart beating harder as his hatred for crowds took over.<br />
The Aquarium entrance had about ten thousand people milling around in front of it, mostly the students and teachers getting their tickets to enter. We stood patiently in line, wondering when we&#8217;d get in. Then one of the Aquarium employees yelled out that we (that being anyone waiting in line) could get tickets for both the Aquarium and the IMAX movie at the theatre box office. Even before the employee finished yelling we were half-way to the other end of the complex.<br />
The lineup there was almost non-existant. In less than two minutes, we had our $15 tickets for the Aquarium and the IMAX movie. Our primary goal was the movie, but we had 45 minutes until that goal could be fulfilled. To fill the time in between, we opted to visit the Aquarium first. This meant we had only 40 minutes or so to see the entire attraction (our ticket didn&#8217;t allow reentry), and paying another $7 wasn&#8217;t part of our plan.<br />
More schools had arrived while we were buying our tickets. More kids. More screaming, hyper, insolent, brutish kids. Dhar and I were beginning to feel a little claustrophobic &#8230; and we weren&#8217;t even through the doors yet.<br />
The atrium didn&#8217;t have much to offer. A new exhibit on squids was under construction, but aside from a concrete wall, there was nothing to see. As we rounded the wall however, everything came into view &#8230; literally. The dark grey concrete wall was part of an immense tank in which several species of fish lived. Along the bottom of the tank ran a 10 foot wide transparent tube through which visitors could walk through the bottom of the tank, seeing the fish in as natural a habitat as was possible in an artificial system.<br />
The walls must have been about a foot thick to withstand the pressure of the water and the pounding of all the kids. If some madman ever wanted to kill off all the children on the planet, all he&#8217;d have to do is create an underwater dome made of crystal, and put all the kids in the dome. They&#8217;d break it apart long before their air ran out.<br />
I snapped a couple fuzzy pictures of rays (or skates &#8230; can&#8217;t quite tell them apart) as they floated just above the clear tube. On the other side of the 40 foot long tube was a large window, allowing a view of the tube itself.<br />
Varieties of tropical fish, plants, eels, and what-have-you were contained in small displays around a nearly semi-circular wall on the other side. The number of kids in the immediate vicinity was enough to drive you nuts. Stefan and Rebecca were completely unfazed by all the screaming, yelling, and crying; they didn&#8217;t notice the trillions of legs and arms, moving faster than Captain Kirk on an alien sex-kitten. I guess when you deal with Eric for 18 hours a day, everything else seems calm.<br />
Therein lay a problem: Dhar and I were ready to quickly work our way ahead of the Munchkin Convention and tour the rest of the Aquarium in relative peace. Being immune to the effects of children however, Stefan and Rebecca were keen on seeing all the exhibits. But being rational adults (you know you&#8217;re getting old when you can write &#8220;adult&#8221; about yourself and not cringe), we came to a compromise: Dhar and I would warp through the Aquarium and meet them at the IMAX theatre 15 minutes before the movie started.<br />
In a flash, Dhar and I entered the tropics (the next area of the complex). Spiders, strange looking fish, rays (that killed more people in the Amazon than piranhas), and a few things that I didn&#8217;t recognize were scattered about. (Not literally.) But there were kids. Where the pathway curved and narrowed, they blocked the path. Dhar was about to have a heart attack &#8212; he couldn&#8217;t handle it anymore. I suggested chucking a few ankle-biters into one of tanks to give us some more room, not to mention a wee bit of enjoyment.<br />
I suddenly stopped, coming to the realization that we were in the Amazon. Every exhibit featuring the Amazon had to have at least one tank of my favourite little fish. I started looking from side to side, briefly appearing as a much larger and hairier version of the kids we were trying to avoid. Then I saw them, tucked next to a set of stairs that ran up to a wooden catwalk. The next thing anyone near me heard was:</p>
<blockquote><p>He&#8217;s swimming in the deep blue sea!<br />
He&#8217;s after you, he&#8217;s after me!<br />
He&#8217;ll eat you up, oh yes he will!<br />
&#8216;Cuz he&#8217;s a baaaaaad fish!<br />
PIRAHNA! PIRAHNA! PIRAHNA! PIRAHNA!</p></blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly, you must be as puzzled as Dhar was. It&#8217;s completely understandable. In fact I&#8217;d be rather surprised if you did recognize this. It&#8217;s a song you&#8217;ve never heard before and probably will never hear again (unless this story somehow becomes a movie, in which case this will be a featured song in the soundtrack). It&#8217;s called &#8220;Piranha&#8221; (gee, no kidding?), and was performed by Lord Tracy, from my friend Chris&#8217; &#8220;Albums by Bands You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of&#8221; collection. It&#8217;s a very fast paced song, sounding almost punkish in its style. And it&#8217;s hilarious.<br />
Having explained that to Dhar, he came to the realization that I was a freak of nature. I was surprised that Stefan and Rebecca hadn&#8217;t warned Dhar ahead of time, or that he hadn&#8217;t figured that out for himself before that point of the trip.<br />
Following my little explanation, Dhar and I promptly ran up the stairs to avoid the flood of children. There were a few running around the catwalk, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as stuffy up there. It was also a lot more boring &#8212; there was nothing to see &#8230; except a couple of macaws hanging from a branch below us, defecating on anyone dumb enough to stand under them (such as ankle-biters). We didn&#8217;t spend long up there, winding our way over to a set of stairs and running right into Stefan and Rebecca. Our plan to get away from the crowds wasn&#8217;t working very well.<br />
The next room had the exhibits most kids (okay, most boys) wanted to see: predatory animals. Electric fishes and eels, angler fish, and the most predatory of them all, sharks. I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by sharks, even though I&#8217;ve never been able to watch all of Jaws &#8212; scares the hell out of me. We wandered about the exhibit, seeing some of the neat things the staff had built to entertain the kids.<br />
Aside from the obvious &#8220;petting pond&#8221; (which we avoided, mostly because the low walls couldn&#8217;t be seen through the million or so children surrounding it exclaiming their disgust at all the sliminess before thrusting their hands back in the water), the exhibit that intrigued Dhar the most was a demonstration of an electric eel&#8217;s shock. It was a simple static electricity device, generating a charge by rubbing plastic plates with a wire brush and spinning a glass bowl (I know, it sounds weird &#8230; but it works).<br />
Kids were running over to this thing, whirling it around, burning the ends of their fingers, and then daring their friends to do the same. Dhar watched in delight as all these kids were whipping their hands around in pain. One girl came up to Dhar and asked him what the device did, and Dhar explained what it was for. Then the girl suggested that Dhar try it first, but he said that he already tried it, and that she could go ahead. The look of apprehension on the girl&#8217;s face was priceless &#8212; she didn&#8217;t seem to realize that she didn&#8217;t have to use it!<br />
Into another short hallway we walked (now beginning to lose the sea of kids) and found a small gift shop featuring entirely shark-related merchandise. It was essentially three 10 foot tall dividers that connected to one of the permanent walls to form a booth. The Aquarium ceiling was at least another ten 10 feet above the wall, and there was no roof on the booth. There wasn&#8217;t much there of interest, save a shark-shaped oven mitt.<br />
As we left the little stand, we swore we heard a crow. Stopping dead in our tracks, we checked to make sure we heard what we thought we heard. We heard it all right. A large raven (though not nearly as large as the ones at the Grand Canyon) was perched on the top of one of the gift shop walls, cawing away happily. Dhar and I only had a moment to wonder what the raven was doing in there when I heard a guard explain the story to a woman who had asked the same question.<br />
When the Aquarium was being built, the raven had flown into the structure. Eventually it had become a mainstay, always in the area. When the walls and windows had finally been installed, they tried to flush the raven out, but with no luck. After a while, they just accepted the bird as a permanent resident.<br />
The next section of the Aquarium was devoted to aquatic reproduction. Emphasis came on the rituals of the reproductive cycles, shying away from the more &#8220;dirty&#8221; aspects. Dhar and I found the quickest way through the section, claiming it was too depressing to remain in for very long. As far as we were concerned, the fish were getting it more often than we were, which put us below fish in the hierarchy of getting lucky.<br />
We soon found ourselves above the entrance to the IMAX theatre, overlooking about a trillion kids standing in line to see the film. Dhar and I suddenly felt very compelled to find Stefan and Rebecca, or end up at the sides of the theatre (not a very nice place to be).<br />
While Dhar backtracked to see if he could find them, I went a bit further ahead to see if somehow Rebecca and Stefan had passed us. The room I entered to contained the local biology: sturgeon, catfish, paddlefish, sawfish, gars, just about anything you&#8217;d expect to find in the New Orleans area swamps and salt-water marshes &#8230; even alligators. Well kept behind a thick panel of Plexiglas (most likely Lexan), the last remnants of dinosaurs just lay on rocks, their eyes twitching slightly.<br />
But a good Aquarium knows how to sell itself and its attractions. Aquarium of the Americas was no exception to this rule. One of their claims to fame is a rare albino alligator. I&#8217;d never seen one before, and the tank it lay in (as nonchalantly as its brethren) allowed me to get close to the great white gator. My pictures weren&#8217;t the greatest, due in part to the tank walls and the refractive properties of the water. But I got my proof for those nay-sayers.<br />
Next to the alligator tank I found a small sign which told the tale of a rather confused shark. Apparently a lonely male bull shark managed to get lost while swimming in the Gulf of Mexico. Not a terribly hard thing to do &#8212; it is a large body of water, after all. But this guy swam up the Mississippi River &#8230; to St. Louis, over 600 miles upstream in fresh water. Okay, some bull sharks live in fresh water, but the story seemed to indicate that it was a salt water shark.<br />
Dhar reappeared, not having been able to find either Rebecca or Stefan. We thought that maybe the crowds had gotten to them after all, and had gone ahead to the theatre to meet us there. We jogged our way out of the Aquarium and down the outside of the complex to the theatre entrance. The trillion or so children were gone, undoubtedly waiting in line for seats. To make things worse, neither Stefan or Rebecca could be found. It was not looking very promising&#8230;<br />
Dhar suggested that I wait in line while he waited for Rebecca and Stefan to appear. He couldn&#8217;t go back into the Aquarium (due to the &#8216;no reentry&#8217; policy) and waited in the upper lobby. I ran down the stairs to the lower level to wait in the line.<br />
Sure enough, the trillion or so school children were already there. If we were lucky, we would get seats in Tuktoyaktuk. About five minutes after I got in line, one of the yellow-shirted teachers (I assume it was a teacher, all the visitors from the local schools were wearing yellow shirts) called for all the students to group on the other side of the foyer. In less than a minute, there were only thirty people in our lineup. No sooner had the line decreased in size than Dhar reappeared with Stefan and Rebecca in tow.<br />
Our apparent good luck started to sour only seconds later, when the yellow-shirted kids were let in through the doors on the opposite side of the lobby. We hoped that we would be let in first, or at least at the same time. It was a good five minutes before the doors opened and we walked into a short hallway, picked up our polarized lenses and took seats towards the back of the theatre.<br />
What&#8217;s with the polarized lenses? Geez, I forgot to mention this was an IMAX 3D theatre, didn&#8217;t I? (How did that slip my mind?) Yes, IMAX 3D. If you&#8217;ve ever seen an IMAX movie, you know what the image quality is like, and that the sheer size of the movie makes all the world of difference when watching something you&#8217;ve never seen before. So it was fairly safe to say that when we (all of whom had seen an ordinary IMAX movie &#8230; assuming you can call an IMAX movie &#8216;ordinary&#8217;) heard about the 3D movie, we had to see it. (Truthfully, I can&#8217;t speak for Rebecca. But Dhar, Stefan, and myself were gung-ho enough for about 20 people.)<br />
The process was fairly simple: the movie was filmed with a special camera that mimics the human bi-optical perspective (i.e. it has two lenses spaced about an inch and a half apart); the film is then run through a special camera that projects both images through polarized filters, which polarize one side vertically and other horizontally; the glasses block out one side of the image, allowing your brain to see two distinct images (a normal happenstance), which are pieced together in the occipital lobe of your brain, creating a three dimensional image.<br />
Having said that, the movie was amazing. The introduction was in standard 2D, during which time the glasses were useless. But when the 3D portion started, all the hoopla (and the price of the tickets) became justified. Aquatic life was the subject of the movie, and the 3D portion started in the sea &#8230; rather, right at the surface of the sea. The water seemed to literally come right out of the screen, your eyes right at the border of air and water. It was a surreal feeling to know that you should be wet, but weren&#8217;t.<br />
The movie made good use of perspective, having fish or other aquatic animals swim up to the camera and then swim away. A pass through a kelp forest was equally as intense. The quality of the IMAX film process led to another little feature &#8212; small particles of matter could be seen float all around you for most of the 20 &#8211; 30 minute movie. Of course nothing was so disturbing as a disgusting little sea creature that terrorized all the kids in the front rows.<br />
Stefan, Dhar, and I spent a good deal of time looking at the technical aspects of the movie. This involved wearing the glasses upside-down, wearing the glasses backwards, not wearing the glasses, or wearing two pairs at once. Except when not wearing only one set of the lenses, you could see the 3D effect normally. Even when the lenses were backwards or upside-down, the brain could still create the proper image.<br />
One problem we noticed with the movie was focusing. Humanity has existed in a true three dimensional environment since the day eyes were created. Focusing on a nearby item or on a mountain hundreds of kilometres away became taken for granted, we had control over the focus. But not in the movie. The focusing was done by the filming camera, so only those details that the cameraman filmed in focus remained in focus. If you tried to look deeper into the 3D image to see something else that was a bit fuzzy, it remained fuzzy. This tended to cause a lot of eye strain after a while, and both Stefan and I took our glasses off more than once during the movie to rest our eyes and avoid a brain hemorrhage.<br />
Everyone applauded loudly when the movie ended, with good reason. It&#8217;s quite the achievement. Too bad most of them don&#8217;t know IMAX is a Canadian invention. (The company used to be based in my hometown until they moved to Toronto.)<br />
As we left the theatre we handed in our polarized glasses, assumedly for recycling or reuse at the theatre. When we arrived back at the main floor, Rebecca ducked into the nearby gift shop to buy something for the kids. I could imagine Eric and Thea&#8217;s excitement when Rebecca and Stefan returned home &#8212; gifts from faraway lands. My sister and I were always like that when my parents returned from some corner of the Earth I haven&#8217;t yet seen. It was usually a t-shirt, but at least it was an interesting shirt.<br />
Outside was surprisingly cool considering the rain had stopped some time earlier. According to all that I had heard of New Orleans, it should&#8217;ve been sweltering and sunny by that time. But the clouds still cast the grey gloom about the city. At least the air wasn&#8217;t dripping with humidity. It was strange weather, at least from what we had been used to since we left the Rocky Mountains, and different than we had expected in Southern Louisiana.<br />
We returned to the Neon to drive back to the hotel. We obtained a much better view of the downtown core of New Orleans, the filtered sunshine provided much better light than the streetlamps at night. It didn&#8217;t change the fact that we still had to deal with far too many one-way roads though. But Dhar had quickly grown familiar with New Orleans, and had us back at the hotel before we could say &#8220;jambalaya&#8221;.<br />
Upon returning however, Dhar suddenly became rather aloof again. He discussed taking the car back (we felt we didn&#8217;t need it anymore), but had some other things in mind, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda. I figure that by now you&#8217;ve probably realized that this wasn&#8217;t an abnormal thing for Dhar. It was still a little disturbing though.<br />
As Dhar sped off down a side road, we remaining three reentered the hotel. But instead of going immediately to our room, Rebecca wandered over to the front desk and asked if it was possible to change rooms. Somewhere along the line we had found out that the hotel was nearly deserted (no events were ongoing at the time to warrant a full house), and this gave Rebecca the idea that more room would be a good idea for the four of us.<br />
Stefan wasn&#8217;t really in the arguing mode, so he boarded the elevator (partly thinking that we would quickly be following) and went up without us. The hotel manager finally gave into Rebecca&#8217;s request after a few minutes of haggling and provided her with a key to a room two doors down from ours. He said that we could have it for an extra $10.<br />
Stefan was waiting for us when we got off on the 6th floor (he didn&#8217;t have a key), and was looking a little peeved. The new room was on the same side of the hall as our current one, but was in the corner of the building. This was one of the &#8220;suites&#8221;, having a separate bedroom with king-sized bed (and a TV), large bathroom, couch, table, full kitchenette (with a dishwasher), and a large TV in the living room. It took us only moment to decide to keep the room, which led us to transfer all our stuff from the first room to the new one.<br />
It was now time to relax slightly. We hadn&#8217;t really had a break since the early afternoon in Las Vegas, and even that was short-lived. We turned on the TV and channel-surfed for a while. We even had both TVs going so we could watch different channels. I wisely separated myself from Stefan and Rebecca, who laid down on the bed in the separate room. Before long, the door had closed behind them.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate Supplementary</strong><br />
I feel lonely. I should have gone off with Dhar and get into trouble. It&#8217;s not that being alone with Stef &amp; Rebecca is bad &#8211; don&#8217;t get me wrong, they&#8217;re good friends &#8211; but if you put [a couple] in a place where they can&#8217;t be alone, they start getting annoyingly, rather, sickeningly emotional towards each other.<br />
I&#8217;m not uncomfortable about sex &#8211; many of my friends are very knowledgeable (and experienced) about sex. My problem stems from my current solitary status &#8211; and whenever I am reminded of this, I get depressed, irritable and downright awful. I&#8217;ll have to make sure that they get some time along tonight.<br />
I have to envy both of them &#8211; devoted to each other, defined goals, children &#8230; and Rebecca is a sex expert! I will grant them one thing over most other couples I&#8217;ve met &#8211; they&#8217;re quiet. Don&#8217;t make me any more comfortable though.
</p></blockquote>
<p>About an hour or so later, the door opened and Rebecca emerged. Stefan had apparently gone to sleep and she didn&#8217;t want to disturb him. It was time to start thinking about our next meal. Rebecca desperately wanted to eat at one of the balconied restaurants in the French Quarter. The idea was very appealing &#8230; if only the weather would cooperate.<br />
We started calling some of the restaurants that came recommended. All had a maximum of three people at a table (due to the width of the terraces), and all were open only if the weather permitted it. Rain had started to fall again, but only lightly. This gave us some hope of obtaining a table. But what if Dhar returned before we left? The problem was Dhar never said when he was returning (if at all), so we couldn&#8217;t plan anything to include him.<br />
The rain increased to a steady heavy rainfall as we discussed the matter. The balconies seemed out of the picture. So we started digging through more of the restaurants to find alternatives. After a little debate over what kind of food we wanted, we decided upon the CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon. Rebecca called and made reservations at 18:30 for four, just in case Dhar reappeared. .<br />
Stefan stumbled out of the bedroom, looking a little disheveled, but otherwise awake. He was a little surprised to find that dinner had been planned without his knowledge (or consent) &#8230; we suggested that he be awake the next time.<br />
The next order of business was transportation. We didn&#8217;t know for certain whether or not Dhar was taking the car back (although we assumed he was). Mind you, we were also unsure of his time of return. Excluding Dhar from the grand scheme, we narrowed the choices to the trolleys or a taxi. I held out for the trolley. I&#8217;d wanted to ride one ever since I saw one on Carrollton Avenue earlier in the day.<br />
Thus began the tidying up. Not of the room, but of ourselves. This required me to take a trip down to the hotel lobby and coerce one of the valets to let me into the van to retrieve my toiletries bag, which I had accidentally left behind. The hair was combed, the teeth brushed, and the beard shaved. A shower wasn&#8217;t terribly necessary (we hadn&#8217;t exerted ourselves enough to warrant one), so was ignored.<br />
As we approached our moment of departure, we knew we would have to leave a note for Dhar to tell him where we were. I opted to write the note in advance, but spent most of the note telling him where I would be after sending Rebecca and Stefan home to spend some time alone. I had decided that I would get some relief by allowing them relief from us. I already knew Dhar would be in agreement (we had discussed the issue a few times before, usually when Stefan and Rebecca were sound asleep in the rear bunk). The trick was to leave it for Dhar but make sure that neither Stefan or Rebecca saw the contents.<br />
As we entered the lobby, we went to the front desk to leave the message. I was handed an envelope, upon which we wrote Dhar&#8217;s name. I then inserted the note (despite Rebecca&#8217;s repeated requests to read it first) and sealed it. We continued to the front door and out into the early evening to catch a trolley to downtown.<br />
We didn&#8217;t know how long we would have to wait, there was no posted schedule. According to those we had asked, the trolleys ran about every 15 minutes. That was assuming no delays anywhere along the lines. The longer we stood waiting, the more we wished we had brought along an umbrella. The rain had never completely stopped, coming and going in spurts, and the odd few drops seemed to indicate another downpour. And we had no shelter.<br />
A vacationing couple arrived, and a short conversation ensued. Two trolley cars passed in the opposite direction, we continued to absorb more rain, and our time kept running out. The Rebecca, Stefan and I soon starting considering taking a taxi if we were to make our dinner reservation downtown. Almost as soon as that thought had come out into the open, Dhar emerged from a taxi in front of our hotel. Immediately I yelled for him not to let the cab get away, and the three of us sped across the St. Charles westbound lanes.<br />
Having nothing else to do, Dhar decided to tag along even though he had already eaten. Our taxi driver was a local man, possessing a very Cajun accent. He was about 25 years old, and had lived in the area all his life. As he drove us along (giving us some interesting information about the city &#8230; which I&#8217;ve since forgotten), he told us of his dream: to buy a house in or near the French Quarter and rent it out during Mardi Gras for $2,000 a week.<br />
Sounds steep? When you consider that hotel rooms are at least $100 a night (and higher in the French Quarter), and houses can sleep as many people as you can cram into them, $2,000 isn&#8217;t such a major cost. The man added he would gladly stock the fridge and supply the beer and liquor. I figured he&#8217;d still make a ton of money during that week.<br />
When we arrived at Bourbon Street, Dhar paid the fare and we hopped out. The rains had washed the roads, much of the smell from the night before was gone (but still noticeable). All the drunks were gone too, the lack of a festival seemed to drive them off. Bourbon Street was now the domain of the tourist, soon to give way to the drunken tourist as night fell.<br />
As we neared the CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon, we saw the Maitre D&#8217; out front, trying to draw in early eaters. It seemed that most people tended to eat a little later in New Orleans, typically having dinner after 19:00. Ironically enough, that was when I typically had my dinner when I lived at home. But tonight we were the &#8220;early birds&#8221;, about to catch a very large worm.<br />
The Maitre D&#8217; spotted us as we neared, and his tirade began again. The chef was doing something special for those keen on coming out early, prepared to withstand the culinary onslaught that was about to be inflicted upon them. For nearly five minutes, with hardly a chance to catch his breath, the Maitre D&#8217; extolled the virtues of the menu, the succulence of the food, the charm that exuded from the building itself. Then, as if on cue, we all nodded in agreement and walked in as if we had been hooked by the Maitre D&#8217;s divine skills. We promptly announced we had reservations.<br />
The only thing that stopped the Maitre D&#8217;s chin from falling too far was the floor. For nearly a half second (which was the longest silence we heard from him) he stared at us in disbelief. To be somewhat supportive to the distraught man, I tried to cheer him up, complimenting him on his wonderful speech. He walked outside in disbelief, poking fun at the way we&#8217;d led him on when he was trying to do the same to us.<br />
CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon was a small restaurant, having only 20 tables or so. Upscale restaurants tend not to have too large a space, and usually have a large staff. Such was the case with CafÃ¯ ¿ ½ Rue Bourbon. We had four or five people waiting on us in various roles: the Maitre D&#8217;, a wine steward, hostess, server, and probably someone else that I&#8217;ve since forgotten.<br />
The wine was one of the first orders of the night, and that became a in-depth debate between the four of us and the wine steward. Rebecca was keen on a 1993 wine, but none was to be found. (From what I understand, 1993 was a good year &#8212; so good there&#8217;s no wine left.) To ensure we had an excellent wine as we could afford, I offered to pay for it (my logic following along similar lines that brought me to pay for the hotel room in Las Vegas).<br />
I can&#8217;t remember the name of the wine, but it was a dry (a one or a zero) red. Not a terribly large wine drinker, I&#8217;m by no means experienced in what is good and what isn&#8217;t. But I know what I like, and I didn&#8217;t hate it.<br />
When it came time to order, Rebecca and I opted for one of the Chef&#8217;s specials &#8212; blackened red fish. I didn&#8217;t know exactly what it was, but all I remember is asking for it nice and hot. I figured that sooner or later I&#8217;d have to eat something that was hot, if only to get the experience. Rebecca had done the same, but only after consulting with the hostess to make sure it wasn&#8217;t too hot. We weren&#8217;t the typical tourists that wandered through New Orleans, thinking hot for them was hot for a resident of the Mississippi delta. No, my friend, what&#8217;s hot for them would kill most people. Except Dhar. What Dhar considers hot could be used to generate steam in a nuclear power plant.<br />
Stefan ordered some local specialty, but I can&#8217;t remember if it was seafood-based or chicken. Either way it was a lot tamer than the jambalaya he had the night before. Dhar, who had already eaten prior to coming out to dinner, ate precious little and only ordered an appetizer as his meal.<br />
Despite my request for hot food, my fish wouldn&#8217;t have made Frosty the Snowman break a sweat. It was good fish, but it was lacking the spicy flavour I had been hoping for. I was tempted to return it and get something spicier, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling like an asshole that night, and quietly ate my fish.<br />
Stefan picked up the tab for dinner (later to be recorded in the log for prosperity &#8230; and so Stefan would get some of his money back), and we returned to Bourbon Street. In the hour and a half that we had dined leisurely, what was left of the tourist population of New Orleans had descended on the French Quarter. Not all of them in the streets &#8212; many were eating, or in the various shops. But it didn&#8217;t look dead any longer.<br />
We sauntered down the street, looking for something that would interest us. Dhar and I were hatching plans to ditch Stefan and Rebecca, in hopes the two of them would go back to the hotel early. Unfortunately, no matter what stores and whatnot we entered, the group stayed tight. We must have entered half a dozen sex shops, three or four voodoo stores, about a half-million t-shirt vendors, and a couple of artwork boutiques. But no such luck, we were still together.<br />
After a while, one of us came to the conclusion that we needed to listen to some music. We passed by one particular club that was blaring some of the funkiest R&amp;B that I&#8217;d heard in years &#8230; and it was live! Dhar was the first to duck in the door, the rest following on his heels. We could hardly hear ourselves, but we didn&#8217;t much care. At least until we realized that the one drink minimum cost $8.50 apiece. That, unfortunately, was after we&#8217;d already bought the damn things. I happened to notice the prices on the back wall, hidden from view.<br />
We quickly agreed that one drink was all that place was going to get out of us, and as soon as we were done, we were gone. But we didn&#8217;t escape that establishment any further unscathed. To add injury to insult, one of the band members started making rounds of the club with half a water cooler bottle collecting tips from the audience. It wasn&#8217;t mentioned anywhere, nor was it said by anyone, but the tips were mandatory. I found the smallest bill I had and tossed it in. I was very reluctant to pay $8.50 for a drink then have to pay another dollar to leave. I only wish I could remember the name of the place so I could warn people not to go there.<br />
We hastily left and resumed our wanderings. Down side streets and along a few alleys, all the while Rebecca was complaining about how cold it was. That much I could agree with. All I had every heard of New Orleans was how hot and humid it was there. The day before, New Orleans lived up to that reputation with every second. But as we tried our best to get lost, we shivered in temperatures that were in the low teens (Celsius) and possibly even as low as single digits.<br />
We visited several stores, shops and boutiques before Dhar remembered that he wanted to buy a radar detector. That led us back out to Canal Street at the western edge of the French Quarter. All along the east side of Canal Street are a half dozen large electronics stores which cater to tourists of all countries. Huge camera lenses, multi-lingual radar detectors, more audio products than you could listen to in a life time &#8230; and all over-priced. Must be because of the tourists. Rather, the gullibility of the tourists and the greed of the owners.<br />
Rebecca and I did window shopping while Dhar and Stefan haggled with the twits behind the desk at one of these shops. While they argued for a better price, I hinted to Rebecca that Dhar and I were staying out late that night, to give her and Stefan some time alone. She took a little offense to it, but I added (as humourously as possible) that the two of them were driving Dhar and I crazy.<br />
Dhar left the place empty-handed. The prices that the stores wanted (they all seemed to have the same &#8220;high-priced&#8221; supplier) were more expensive than ones Dhar could get back home &#8230; even if the exchange rate was 1:1. Dejected and forlorn, we continued to wander our way around the city.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take long for our topics of conversation to start swaying towards being drunk. I suppose it was in part to our earlier attempt that evening at the R&amp;B club (thwarted due to the exorbitant price of a $0.50 drink) and constantly being passed by overly inebriated tourists. The conversation continued until we walked into a store just inside the French Quarter to purchase something highly intoxicating.<br />
The store was like a small Wal-mart: everything you could possibly never need all under one roof. Including the illusive Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, which was what the goal of the night quickly became. In addition to the rum, we also purchased a large bottle of cranberry juice for mixing. I chose to look for something more along my lines, but struck up empty. In our following continued wanderings along Canal Street I looked in several of the smaller corner stores with about as much success.<br />
Finally the lure of the liquor got us directed towards our awaiting hotel room. We weren&#8217;t up for the walk however, and jumped into the first taxi we came across. The driver was an older man (compared to our previous driver), in his 40&#8217;s, and a member of one of the Louisiana cultural groups: Creole, Acadian, or Cajun &#8230; I don&#8217;t know which. He hardly acknowledged our entrance into his cab, barely indicated that he understood our request, and continued his unintelligible conversation with someone over taxi&#8217;s radio.<br />
Arriving back at the hotel, I paid the cab fare and we proceeded to our hotel room. The TV shone to life as Stefan poured out three drinks, myself abstaining. And there we sat and talked and watched TV for a couple of hours. One of our topics was the plan for the following day. Not knowing exactly how long a drive we had until we reached home, we didn&#8217;t want to stay too long in New Orleans. Stefan and Dhar both wanted to return by Saturday so they could do some work (a taboo subject to be discussing on a vacation).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplementary</strong><br />
New Orleans is cold. Why, I dunno. Our hotel is nice, but having Stef &amp; Rebecca in the next [private] room is going to be interesting. I still want to go out and leave Rebecca and Stef alone for a while.<br />
Went to the Café Rue Bourbon. Good food, but was hoping for something a tad spicier.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At a quarter after midnight, one of Stefan or Rebecca promptly announced that it was time for bed. Dhar and I took the cue to announce that we were still hungry and were going to get something eat. At first our action might have appeared rather innocent in its nature, but I quickly emphasized that we would not be back until 02:00 at the earliest. I figured that an hour and three-quarters would be sufficient enough time for whatever was needed. (For Dhar and I, it was simply to escape for a short time.)<br />
After changing into some slightly warmer clothes, Dhar and I took the only room key and ventured out into the cool night air. Our first order of business was finding a place to eat. I vaguely remembered seeing a restaurant that featured a garlic-based menu not far from the hotel, so we decided to check it out. Alas, we were too late, it had closed almost an hour earlier.<br />
Still hungry, but not discouraged, we turned in the direction of the French Quarter and started walking. I learned a great deal about Dhar that evening, it was kind of a &#8220;male-bonding&#8221; thing, I guess. I don&#8217;t particularly believe in &#8220;male-bonding&#8221;, I think it&#8217;s some term a female psychiatrist came up with to make men feel better about &#8220;talking&#8221;, which many don&#8217;t appear to do. My friends at home and I talk a lot, so this wasn&#8217;t something foreign to myself. It didn&#8217;t seem to be foreign to Dhar either.<br />
One of the things I learned that night was one of the probable reasons why Dhar went off on his own so much. Unlike Stefan, Rebecca, and myself, Dhar had never had a vacation before. He had lived the first 26 years of his life in eastern Ontario, with only the odd excursion outside of his realm. With the advent of this trip, he had been exposed to the wonder of travel, the excitement of discovery, and the feeling of freedom that comes from a true road-trip. At once I understood why Dhar had gone off on his own, why he had chosen to see all that he could see &#8212; he might never see it again.<br />
About two or three blocks from our hotel we stumbled across a little diner called The Trolley Stop, assumedly because it was next to a trolley stop. Not the fanciest looking place we&#8217;d seen, but the &#8220;Open 24 Hours&#8221; sign in the window was enough to convince us to drop in and see what we could order up.<br />
It was almost like stepping into an episode of Cheers &#8212; there were patrons who immediately looked like regulars, and I felt like I was trying to break into a tightly knit group of friends. But the feeling didn&#8217;t last long. A few moments after stepping into the diner, a smiling waitress swooped down upon Dhar and I, and led us to a corner table. The African-American woman looked in her early 30&#8217;s, and was a classic example of a &#8220;people-person&#8221;.<br />
Most restaurant employees are &#8220;professional&#8221;, in that they stand next to the table, intently listening to the orders, speak &#8220;properly&#8221;, and do not engage in idle conversation. This woman swung a chair around so it was backwards to the table, plopped down on the seat leaning her large arms over the back, clutching a pad and pen in one hand. She then struck up a brief conversation about what was on the menu, and asked if we liked what we&#8217;d seen of New Orleans. I guess to the well-trained eye, you can&#8217;t escape looking like a tourist.<br />
When the topic of food rolled around, we began to ask for suggestions. We concentrated on the things we had never eaten before, and gumbo rose to the top of the list. Dhar ordered a seafood gumbo, and I ordered the chicken variety. Dhar then engaged in a debate about hot food with the waitress, denying the cook could make it hot enough for him. Lo and behold, the cook came out to support the diner&#8217;s end of the conversation. After a few minutes, the waitress winked at him and said: &#8220;We&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; ya honey!&#8221; and laughed as they went off to concoct a gumbo that the army could use as a chemical weapon. I made sure that they understood I was keen on living that night.<br />
To drink I ordered another Abita Turbodog, purposely asking for the bottle so I&#8217;d bring it back with me. I had every intention of showing my friends back home the label of my new favourite beer. It was just as I sort of remembered it from the night before (one Turbodog and lime daiquiri do strange things to you &#8212; I suppose I should be glad I didn&#8217;t have a margarita): cold, dark, and tasty.<br />
Gumbo is a rather interesting dish. It&#8217;s a soup poured over a little bit of rice. It&#8217;s thick, made with vegetables, meats &#8230; just about anything you can think of &#8230; and a lot of spice. Dhar immediately took a spoonful of his bowl, swirled it around in his mouth like an experienced wine taster, the swallowed. The waitress and the cook both stared at him waiting for a verdict on the gumbo. Without a crack in his voice, he pronounced it: &#8220;good&#8221;.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t good enough. Dhar was looking for something that would at least make him break a sweat. Although spicy enough to burn out the sinuses of most normal people (I tasted a drop from my little finger and found it more than enough to make me choke), Dhar slurped it down like a glass of ice water. He was quick to point out that it was a very tasty dish &#8212; the flavours were intense and countered the lack of spiciness. Although not deathly hot, I had to agree that gumbo is a meal that I would eat again.<br />
Paying our bill and leaving a nice tip for the wonderful service we received, Dhar and I resumed our trip towards the French Quarter. We still had over an hour to kill before we could go back, so we decided to see what trouble we could get into. I felt a little apprehensive about following Dhar after midnight, wondering if we&#8217;d get shot at or attacked by some freak in the shadows. Trouble seemed to follow Dhar. I just hoped trouble didn&#8217;t like me.<br />
Along the way we passed two women and drunk man arguing with one another; a different drunk man urinating in the middle of the sidewalk, oblivious to our existence; a few vagrants trying to find a place to bunk down for the night; and a couple bank machines, both of which Dhar tried to use. It was at the first bank machine that I came to the realization that I had forgotten the Turbodog bottle, despite my asking Dhar to remind me.<br />
Dhar&#8217;s luck with bank machines south of the border was dismal. Every time he tried to withdraw $100, the transaction was refused. I wondered why he was having so much difficulty, especially when my bank card neatly deposited nearly any amount I needed with only a slight wait for the CIBC&#8217;s computers to figure out where my bank account was. Then I found out that Dhar was using his Mastercard to withdraw money. I don&#8217;t like using credit cards to do that &#8212; too much of a hassle. Eventually Dhar had to settle for $20 at a time, which cost him over $4 in transaction fees each time he tried.<br />
The business district was devoid of activity, save for the biting wind that blew through the canyons created by the skyscrapers. Dhar and I blasted through the area with the determination of the most dedicated speed-walkers. In only a few minutes we were standing on the edge of Canal Street, looking into the French Quarter.<br />
Some had left, but the heart of the city continued to pump with life. The strip bars were still open, the bars still poured drinks, and a few restaurants still served food. On this occasion, only Dhar entered any of the establishments, which was to obtain a drink.<br />
Having no plan other than to stay out until at least 02:00, we wasted time by walking wherever it seemed like a good idea. That brought us to the Aquarium of the Americas. But we approached it from the eastern side, from where the French Quarter met the Mississippi River. A pathway ran alongside the river, parking lots on the one side, bushes and the river on the other.<br />
All the drinking finally got to Dhar, and he needed use of the facilities. Specifically a toilet &#8230; any toilet. Unfortunately there wasn&#8217;t any in the area, at least none that were open for use. Dhar couldn&#8217;t just whip it out and let loose on the path either &#8212; there were undercover cops around. (You can tell because they&#8217;re the ones sitting in large cars in parking lots at 01:45 in the morning.) So we kept walking until we were partially out of sight, at which time Dhar dove behind one of the bushes before he wet his pants. I kept watch for the aforementioned authorities.<br />
Feeling a little lighter and a lot more relieved, Dhar returned to the path and we walked towards the Aquarium. It looked very different at night, all the lights were off except for a few neon signs. I wondered what the crow was doing then, and if anyone had fed it that night.<br />
We rounded the western corner of the building and passed through the flood-wall gate, debating for a brief moment to follow the trolley tracks to see where they went. Soon we found ourselves back in the business district again, and with nothing else to do. Trouble had seemed to elude us.<br />
All the souls of the evening realm of New Orleans that we had met on our way to the French Quarter were gone. A trolley clunked by on what I assumed to be the last run of the night (even though everything we had read indicated a much earlier stop time), heading towards our hotel. For a brief moment we contemplated taking a ride, but the extra time it would take to walk the distance we considered time well spent. The last thing you want to do is walk in on your roommates when they&#8217;re occupied.<br />
It was after 02:30 when we arrived back at the hotel. For a fleeting moment I had this awful thought that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to get in, that the hotel locked its doors after a particular time. That was a short fear that disappeared when we saw the beaming face of the night clerk, watching the door for any activity. We smiled and said &#8216;hello&#8217; as we boarded the elevator.<br />
The lights were all off, and the room was quiet. We entered as silently as we possibly could, not a particularly easy task when the door has squeaky hinges and the toilet flushes loudly. I brushed my teeth, relieved my bladder pressure, and removed the sheets from my cot. I didn&#8217;t feel like sleeping on the cot that night, and flopped on the couch for my rest. Dhar opted for his cot.<br />
Dhar fell asleep almost instantly, not having slept for nearly 30 hours. Unfortunately it also meant he started snoring earlier than usual. But soon I too was sleeping soundly. That is, until Dhar woke me up some two or so hours later. That I considered quite the feat &#8212; once I fall asleep, I sleep hard. The only think I know that gets me up in the middle of the night is a fire alarm. But Dhar&#8217;s snoring was so loud I woke up. I lay in amazement for a few moments before I got up and nudged Dhar awake to get him to stop.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As a kid, I could never sleep in a moving car. I could never understand why, but the motion made me feel uneasy and I would sit there until we stopped (usually at home) before passing out. This inability to sleep in cars stayed true until I went on our tour of America. I quickly learned to shrug off that apprehension, falling asleep at a moment&#8217;s notice.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly when I succumbed to the ravaging of Mr. Sandman, but I do know that I did get a little sleep that night. The night was hot and muggy so I slept in my clothes. In a rare event, I managed to sleep in the rear bunk, since Stefan was driving and Rebecca was (also in a rare event) awake. As with school-buses that pass over bumps in the road, the rear end of the Behemoth tended to fling anyone in the rear in a slightly vertical motion. I was bounced around once in a while, but after a while I didn&#8217;t seem to notice or care.<br />
When I awoke, Rebecca was sleeping in the depression in the floor, her head resting on the extra seat cushion from the rear bench. It was still very dark out, but I could tell that the desert had been replaced with trees which now lined the sides of the Interstate. Carefully stepping my way over Rebecca, I made my way to one of the forward seats. It turned out I had awaken at a very appropriate time, about 20 miles outside of San Antonio. It was nearly 05:00, and the early morning traffic was nonexistent.<br />
The City of San Antonio seemed to come from a transformation of the forest, from trees to steel, glass, and concrete. Street lights appeared and soon we found ourselves in a bustling, albeit sleeping, city. Our primary goal was to find The Alamo. It was marked on our maps, providing an approximate location. Having no maps of San Antonio, we would have to guess our way in finding its exact location.<br />
The I-10 came in from a roughly north direction. From there, we turned briefly onto I-35 heading west until we got to I-37, and resumed a southerly direction. After only about a mile into I-37, we got off at the Houston Street off-ramp listing The Alamo. Unfortunately the markings disappeared once we arrived at street level.<br />
Everyone ended up navigating, trying to find some indication that would show us The Alamo. We went up and down nearly every street, road, avenue, and boulevard in the general vicinity of The Alamo before someone got the idea of following a large wall around to see what it was. To our luck, the wall that we had seen a half dozen times in our search happened to be the outer wall of The Alamo.<br />
All the pictures and movie scenes that I had seen in my years never gave an impression of The Alamo sitting in the heart of San Antonio. From the surrounding streets you couldn&#8217;t see the mission building, the main building of The Alamo, and the part everyone recognizes. We pulled up at the main entrance of the complex while Dhar ran out and took a picture. As it turns out, all he got was a doorway through The Alamo&#8217;s walls, it was impossible to see anything past the hall.<br />
Dhar returned to the van, and we drove off. Disrespectful as it was, I couldn&#8217;t help but find everything that The Alamo stood for (in a metaphorical sense) rather laughable. The American view that defeat is not an option is something I simply cannot fathom. 187 people were massacred when Santa Ana&#8217;s forces laid siege to the mission fortress, and Americans now view the defenders as heroes. I seem to have this rather odd view that they were too damn stubborn to realize they were hopelessly outnumbered, and would be better off retreating to return with more soldiers.<br />
But the defeat at The Alamo wouldn&#8217;t be the last for America, though they would seldom admit to it. Take Vietnam for example: for more years than was necessary, the United States led the &#8220;fight for democracy&#8221; in Vietnam, afraid that the incursion of Red Chinese might somehow affect American freedom on the other side of the Pacific. After hundreds of thousands of American causalities (a.k.a. deaths), someone finally realized the situation was hopeless. (You&#8217;ll note that the stubbornness hadn&#8217;t gone away in the 160 some-odd years since The Alamo.) When American troops finally pulled out, the action was labeled as a &#8220;strategic withdrawal&#8221;. Sometimes they just don&#8217;t know when to quit.<br />
Stefan pulled back onto Houston Street and headed back to the I-37. A few traffic lights and a couple side streets, and we were heading north back to the I-35 and then to the I-10, which would take us to Houston. Our navigation there was the worst we had to that point (but wouldn&#8217;t be the worst overall), we even managed to take the long route out of San Antonio &#8212; we should have taken the I-37 south to the I-10 where it swung from north-south to east-west, saving about 10 miles.<br />
Not far out of San Antonio, Stefan called it quits for driving and abdicated the throne to Dhar. I in turn took over as navigator as Stefan hopped in bed with Rebecca for some sleep. Dhar and I chatted a while as we drove, I found out that Stefan had managed to run into as many deer in Texas as we had found rabbits in New Mexico. I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh, but it explained why Stefan seemed a little strung out while we were trying to find The Alamo.<br />
But I quickly realized that I hadn&#8217;t received as much sleep as I thought I had. All that driving I had done the day before (or earlier that evening, depending on your point of view) had hit me harder than previously acknowledged. My eyes started sagging, my thoughts clouded over, my muscles gave out, and before I knew it, I was waking up with a stiff neck. When I awoke, Dhar started laughing at me, apparently my bobbing head had become a source of entertainment for him as he drove.<br />
We drove until Dhar got tired, which seemed unusual for our resident vampire. So I took over driving again, just as dawn was beginning to crack. I figured I had enough sleep during our initial stint on the I-10 to make it through the day. I was wrong. Dhar passed out after only 15 minutes or so, and it wasn&#8217;t long before I felt my judgment clouding and my eyelids became very heavy. I wasn&#8217;t very far off from falling asleep. As Dhar put it, I needed to have my clock reset with the rising sun.<br />
But the rising sun was hidden behind a thick haze, and my eyes never set upon the restorative powers of the sun&#8217;s rays &#8212; I was getting more sleepy by the second. With what few mental faculties I had left, I managed to convince myself to pull over at the next rest stop and transfer the power to someone else before I lost control and killed the lot of us in a fiery blaze of glory. Luckily, a rest stop appeared before I dozed off behind the wheel.<br />
I pulled up to the side, behind several semi-trailers (whose drivers were undoubtedly doing the same thing I was about to do) and came to the gentlest stop the van had yet performed. No-one woke up. Not in the mood to waken anyone, I put the gear in park, turned off the engine, tilted my chair back, and went one-to-one with the sleep fairy and lost in a first-round knockout.<br />
I have no idea how long I slept, but it couldn&#8217;t have been more than an hour. I didn&#8217;t seem to sleep too deeply either, for when Stefan woke up and promptly asked where we were, I immediately replied that I didn&#8217;t have a clue and only stopped to prevent us from dying in a head-on collision when I fell asleep while driving. Stefan accepted the logic without question.<br />
Having only marginally more sleep than I, Stefan took over driving for the next little while. (Remember that Stefan slept through the Roswell to Fort Stockton stretch.) By that time, I was more or less awake, and sat behind Stefan while we continued our easterly direction. We drove until around 10:00, when Stefan and I could no longer withstand our stomachs&#8217; calls to breakfast. Luckily, just east of Houston we came across our favourite eating place, the International House Of Pancakes.<br />
We barely beat the bible-thumper crowd, arriving only about 10 to 20 minutes before an onslaught of well-dressed Texans appeared for post-worship brunch. When we entered, we must have looked quite the sight &#8212; disheveled, tired, hungry, and not smelling at all like roses. We were seated all the same (right under an air conditioning vent) and serviced no different than anyone else. Ya gotta love them Texans!<br />
Texans are a nice bunch, but not as personable as those in Las Vegas. The service wasn&#8217;t poor, but it was like comparing a $150,000 Mercedes-Benz to a $15,000 Chrysler. Both may be good cars, but the Chrysler comes off a lot worse if you drove the Mercedes first.<br />
We gorged ourselves on sustenance, much to the chagrin of the Texans. Every so often I managed to catch a glimpse of someone staring at all the plates, glasses, bowls and pots scattered about our small table. Large families didn&#8217;t have as much food as the four of us did, and it was Stefan and I who seemed to eat the most (though Stefan could out-eat me any day of the week).<br />
When we exited the restaurant, we realized just how much humidity there was. The Gulf of Mexico was now less than 100 miles from us, and its effects could be easily felt. I knew that as we got nearer to Louisiana, and closer to the gulf, the more uncomfortable it would get. The van&#8217;s air conditioner was beginning to look like a good idea, even though we had ruled its use out much earlier because it sucked up a lot of gasoline.<br />
Louisiana would become Rebecca&#8217;s domain during our trip. Here she seemed to gain total control over the rest of us, we didn&#8217;t really argue with her declarations. Her first declaration was that we were visiting a plantation and going on a swamp tour. I hadn&#8217;t really planned on that (I hadn&#8217;t planned on anything), but as far as I was concerned, it was something to do.<br />
Her next declaration was that we weren&#8217;t going to be taking the Interstate all the way to New Orleans, our Louisiana destination. Instead we would follow the coastal highways, overlooking the swamps, bayous, marshes, and the Gulf of Mexico. My efficiency instinct kicked in again, and I tried to persuade the group that the Interstate would be a much better route. After some discussion, we compromised and agreed to take the Interstate half of the way, and the more major highways the rest of the distance. This compromise came to being mostly after I pointed out that some of the highways Rebecca wanted to travel didn&#8217;t exist any more (courtesy of past hurricanes).<br />
Shortly before noon, we crossed from Texas into Louisiana. Seemingly almost immediately, the humidity rose. No longer was it the sticky mass of air we had been traveling through, it was virtually like swimming. If it were any higher, we could have drowned not having come close to the sea. Perspiration couldn&#8217;t evaporate &#8212; it actually attracted more moisture out of the air. It was hideous.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960428.12</strong><br />
<em>Day 8</em><br />
Nevada was hot. Louisiana is humid. We&#8217;re sweating to death here. We&#8217;ve pretty much shot through Texas, although that took about 12 hours to do. We stopped once to see the Alamo, at about 5 in the morning.And so we head for New Orleans, where we intend to relax for a while.<br />
It&#8217;s interesting to note that despite the fact that we all love control, we all get along really well.
</p></blockquote>
<p>After two hours of humid torture, we reached Lafayette. We left the relative comfort of the Interstate and entered onto Highway 90. If you want to see things off-the-beaten-track, you need to take roads that make no sense. Highway 90 is just such a road. According to the map, it wiggles all over hell and half of creation before worming its way to New Orleans. The route easily adds on an extra hour or more to the trip, but the sights are something to behold (though not nearly to the degree of going through Colorado).<br />
There&#8217;s nothing particular special about the route, you travel through a lot of towns (both small and large), through several bayous and swamps, over canals, passing by centuries-old plantations. But any typical tourist route never uncovers these things. Louisiana is a country unto itself, containing a history and culture that can&#8217;t be found anywhere else in the world. You can&#8217;t understand it unless you&#8217;ve seen how the people live and work. New Orleans is a melange of that culture, but the individual flavours are something to experience.<br />
But too much of a good thing soon becomes rather dull, and by the time we reached Houma, about 35 miles from New Orleans, we were all beginning to think the Interstate wasn&#8217;t such a bad idea. I resumed by post behind the wheel, and allowed myself to concentrate on the driving rather than super-saturate myself on the landscape. About 25 miles later, we finally found the I-310.<br />
The I-310 was part of the I-10. American Interstates are brilliant examples of traffic control &#8212; they take an Interstate (say, the I-10) and when it hits a city, they divide it in several places and tack on a third number to indicate a branch or detoured route of that Interstate. Some of these detours go completely around a city, forming a huge ring. Toronto needed something like that about 10 years ago, and it&#8217;s only gotten worse since.<br />
Like most of the Interstates in the New Orleans area, the I-310 was raised above the swamps. (What is it with humanity building cities on swamps?) The highway was pieced together in sections about 50 feet in length. Each section was slightly bowed, creating slight peaks at the seams. The result was a constant thump-bob motion for the entire trip into New Orleans. If the peaks were a little higher, someone might have gotten seasick.<br />
Along both sides of the Interstate were tall swamp trees (don&#8217;t ask me the species, the only vegetation I&#8217;m familiar with in swamps are Spanish moss and mangrove trees), creating a beautiful wall of deep green. The blue sky above us, the white concrete in front, and the green to the sides made the final stretch into New Orleans seem like scene out of The Wizard of Oz. Dorothy was easy to figure out, Dhar was the Tin Man (he had the brains, and two encounters of the dangerous kind pretty much eliminated him from the Lion round), Stefan was the Lion (again, the brains were there), and I the Scarecrow (with reasons following soon). One thing was certain &#8212; we weren&#8217;t in Kansas anymore.<br />
Almost without warning, the swamps parted and we found ourselves surrounded with civilization once again. Thus began the next major issue for us to decide: where to stay. There were two KOAs in New Orleans, west and east of the city centre. We read the descriptions, viewed the maps and checked out the features of each. It took a bit of debate, but we decided that the east KOA would provide us with the best facilities.<br />
Little did we know that the east KOA was over 45 minutes from the side of New Orleans that we were entering from. We cruised through seven miles of non-descript urbanization before the I-10 curved south towards the downtown core. At this point, unbeknownst to us, was the I-610 which provided a shortcut through the eight mile &#8216;U&#8217; shaped loop of the I-10. This I would have liked to have known about, since I was to become rather frustrated with the distance we were traveling.<br />
The loop took us at its most southerly point past the Superdome, then passing about a mile or so northwest of the French Quarter. Along the route we got several good looks at the above ground cemeteries which are well-known in New Orleans. There were several reasons for the above-ground burials, varying from problems with the Black Plague, to level of the water table under the soil (which is mostly marshy in that area of the Mississippi delta). No matter what the reason, it&#8217;s still trÃ¯ ¿ ½s creepy.<br />
We drove further and further away from downtown, and I began to wonder just how close this KOA was to the French Quarter, as the ad in the KOA guidebook claimed. Then before us came a causeway across the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, a lake north of New Orleans. The causeway is over eight miles long, yet it isn&#8217;t the record holder. That goes to a sister causeway over the middle of Lake Pontchartrain, which is over 23 miles across.<br />
We exited the I-10 at Slidell, and headed east on either Highway 190 or a side road, I can&#8217;t remember which, until we reached the New Orleans East KOA campground. It was a beautiful campground, surrounded and speckled with huge deciduous trees, casting shade all over the area. I was immediately surprised to see all the tents and RVs, and wondered what the devil was going on. To that point in the trip, we had managed to avoid all the tourists and traffic &#8230; a sudden burst like that was most disturbing.<br />
Despite the incessant pressure in my bladder, I held fast behind the wheel while Stefan and Rebecca (quickly joined by Dhar) ran inside the office to see if we could get a camping spot for the night. It seemed to take far too long to acquire the information we needed, but eventually Dhar appeared to inform me that the camp was totally full, and the New Orleans West KOA had only a couple slots left. I told Dhar to make sure one of those slots was reserved before we hauled our asses back nearly 50 miles to the other side of the city.<br />
As our luck had it, we had arrived on a very auspicious day &#8212; the last day of the New Orleans Jazz Festival &#8230; the last day for that particular weekend, that is. The Festival would resume the following Friday night. It explained why all the camping spots were taken, and it was our good fortune that a spot could still be found at the other KOA.<br />
Good fortune or not, I was getting really grumpy. I was tired and annoyed that we had to travel another half hour before I could take a whiz. Okay, not entirely true, but that was the way I viewed it. Furthermore, I was especially pissed off at the description for the New Orleans East KOA. It had said that it had the &#8220;easiest access to the French Quarter&#8221;. This meant a shuttle bus to downtown New Orleans. We were under the impression you could walk there. In essence the ad didn&#8217;t lie, but when we found out the shuttle only ran when there was enough interest to warrant a trip, the grey area between a lie and a truth suddenly got a lot thinner.<br />
And so we doubled back on our route, crossing over the seemingly endless causeway, missing the I-610 shortcut due to a lack of knowledge, viewing the Superdome from a different direction, and finally arriving at Williams Boulevard about a half hour later. Here we turned south until we reached Jefferson Highway (nothing more than a four-lane city thoroughfare). We headed east along the Highway for about a mile or so before finding the KOA on the north side of the road.<br />
The New Orleans West KOA wasn&#8217;t nearly as nice as the East KOA, but it had two things the East KOA didn&#8217;t have: a regular shuttlebus and a space for us to park. We didn&#8217;t ever use the shuttlebus, but the fact that it was there was of some importance to us. Stefan ran in and got us checked in fairly swiftly. Arriving at 19:00 gave us the rare opportunity to make normal registration.<br />
Unfortunately, the only spot left that had both water and electricity also had sewage, which we didn&#8217;t need (nor could we reach with such a short waste hose). We parked and immediately set about having a swim and a shower before figuring out what we were to do with the rest of the day. This meant a quick run to the toilet for myself before my bladder emptied onto my shorts.<br />
Having quieted the call of nature, I proceeded to make my way towards the pool. I was, admittedly, a little distracted as I left the washroom. This KOA had a very interesting arrangement for the washrooms and the showers. A long hallway running the width of the building provided access to all the facilities. Entering from the west side, the men&#8217;s washroom was immediately to the left, the women&#8217;s washroom further down on the left, and a half dozen doors were on the right. These doors were the showers, and there was no distinction between male and female.<br />
Two of the showers were in use. I stood there for a moment, knowing full well I had heard Stefan, Rebecca, and Dhar come in through the outer door. Then, in the second shower from the outer door, I heard two voices &#8230; Rebecca and Stefan. I shook my head, laughed to myself, and proceeded towards the pool.<br />
The pool was already populated by a large German woman and two young children, a boy and a girl. I paid them no attention (they politely reciprocated) and promptly fell ungracefully into the pool. Instantly half the stress that had built up over the course of the previous 24 hours vanished in an instant. I swam two lengths, and then bobbed in the shallow end.<br />
A few minutes later, I was joined by Rebecca and Stefan, having finished their bathing. They had decided to have a shower before entering the pool, worried more about the grime they had than the chlorine smell they would take out with them. I was opting to get rid of both of the elements with my shower.<br />
Dhar appeared, fully dressed (he didn&#8217;t seem to like water very much), and announced he was renting a car. The bus would arrive shortly and he would return with transportation. This action of his worried me a fair bit: were we disturbing him in some manner?, was I disturbing him in some manner? I didn&#8217;t know whether or not I was the only one a bit puzzled by the whole fiasco, so I just kept my big mouth shut.<br />
The three of us just floated in the cool water, allowing us the break we needed in an otherwise hectic trip. Already we knew that we were traveling far too quickly, and for once I agreed with several other people that we weren&#8217;t taking enough time to do the trip properly. But as far as we were concerned, it was a taste of America, and we could tell where the best places to go when we went down the next time.<br />
A few times Stefan got stuck on his sentences, which I found a tad peculiar. After Stefan managed to sort himself out, he explained that he had been listening to the German woman speak to the children. Being German by birth and raised with the German language, Stefan&#8217;s ears were trained to listen for the familiar tongue. Still speaking it with his parents, Stefan also regularly uses German. While well naturalized for Canada, Stefan still stumbles when his brain tries to shift gears from English to German.<br />
Ten minutes after falling ungracefully into the pool, I forced myself out to have my shower. I walked the short distance to the front of the KOA office and went in the washroom door. For no particular reason, I walked into the second shower stall and prepared to clean myself. In the left hand corner of the room, next to the door, was a used yellow condom.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;d seen a used condom, it probably won&#8217;t be the last. For a moment, I wondered if it was Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s. I stared, half of me wanting to see if it was still warm, the rest of me yelling at the other half for thinking of something so repulsive. I immediately felt a little annoyed that someone would leave it sitting there, and I refused to believe that Stefan and Rebecca would be so inconsiderate.<br />
I then started feeling very alone. I was a single guy. I&#8217;d been that way over 23 years. I&#8217;d never been on a real &#8220;date&#8221;, never kissed a girl, never done anything that would suggest a &#8220;social life&#8221; of any kind. Most of the time, when the subject came up, it became a big joke for me. &#8220;Oh don&#8217;t worry &#8217;bout me,&#8221; I&#8217;d tell employers when they asked insane deadlines of me, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a social life to screw up.&#8221; Everyone would laugh and I&#8217;d get down to work.<br />
But there I was. Naked, and staring at a recently used condom. I still find it amazing at how a little piece of latex rubber can make a guy feel so damned insecure. I started questioning myself &#8212; why was it I couldn&#8217;t &#8220;pick up&#8221;? Too shy? Maybe. Too forward? Possibly. Too weird? Definitely. Too intense? That was the claim from several of my close friends. The only problem there for me is: how do I act any other way?<br />
I thought about that discarded prophylactic throughout most of my shower. For some totally morbid but known reason, I wanted so badly to know where it came from. As I left the shower room, I started to put the thought out of my head. We had things to do that night, and I didn&#8217;t want something as depressing as old memories of opportunities lost dwelling on my mind.<br />
I returned directly to the van, where Stefan and Rebecca had already gone, and proceeded to find out what we were doing for the rest of the night. Dhar hadn&#8217;t yet returned from the car rental agency, so the three of us took the initial planning steps: visit the French Quarter. Planning took about ten seconds.<br />
At a little after 20:00, Dhar returned with his rented blue Chrysler Neon. Dhar hated it. But the Neon was the only car left in the lot that fit Dhar&#8217;s requirements. A dedicated driver, Dhar was quick to point out all the flaws in the car: the transmission was like a &#8220;tin box&#8221;, closing the doors only sounded good with the windows up, the construction seemed flaky, and so on and so on and so on&#8230; I found out later that for fun, Dhar would rent cars on the weekends and drive them around. I took this to mean that Dhar knew his automobiles.<br />
Dhar seemed up for the trip downtown, but I will admit he didn&#8217;t seem too chipper. We filed into the Neon, Dhar and I in front, Rebecca and Stefan in back, and we went to see how long we could drive before getting hopelessly lost. The first thing we noticed about the Neon was how low it sat. The Behemoth received its name in part from its size &#8212; we could see over most vehicles on the road. In the Neon, we suddenly felt very vulnerable because every vehicle was taller than ours.<br />
We drove east on Jefferson Highway, which by that point was part of Highway 90. Exiting from Metairie (a suburb of New Orleans), we entered New Orleans proper and the road became Claiborne Avenue. We followed the road around and through several areas of houses and industry before finding our way to the I-10 again. We drove along it briefly before exiting at Canal Street to head south into downtown.<br />
Here was our second dismal job of navigating. Rebecca (the &#8220;most responsible&#8221; person on the trip) was guiding us using a couple of maps we had brought along. However, Stefan became frustrated when we began to get lost in all the one-way roads. (Dhar and I were reading off road signs as we drove.) What ensued was a small argument before we finally figured out that Canondelet Street became Bourbon Street when it crossed Canal Street. (Got that?) This was after a few very hasty (and probably illegal) U-turns Dhar managed to pull when we weren&#8217;t looking. This countered a suggestion given to us by one of the KOA staff &#8212; if you missed a left-hand turn in downtown, pull three right turns to get you where you wanted to go &#8230; pulling a left-hand turn would get you a nice fat traffic ticket (you could hardly ever turn left into a one-way road down there).<br />
After what seemed an eternity, we entered the fabled French Quarter. It was teeming with Jazz Festival revelers, most of them quite inebriated. As I would comment later on in that evening, I had never in my life seen so many drunken people before in my life. As I would also add, following that statement: &#8220;When in Rome&#8230;&#8221;<br />
Dhar drove down several roads and alleys before we found the parking garage of the Omni Royal Hotel. Dhar picked up the tab for the parking (he also picked up the tab for the car rental), and we began to wander about the mythical French Quarter.<br />
The French Quarter dated back to the founding of New Orleans in 1718. Many of the brick and plaster buildings still possessed French architectural styles of the period. When the Spaniards took over in 1762, they brought their style to the area as well, leaving their mark in the ornate lace terraces that still overlook the streets. A post-Spanish addition are porcelain plaques pasted to the walls of buildings on street corners bearing the Spanish names of the streets.<br />
Hunger was the driving force for us. We hadn&#8217;t eaten since breakfast that morning, and we were well beyond peckish. (Stefan and I were downright famished.) Finding Bourbon Street, we wandered down its length looking for a suitable establishment to dine at. The selection of restaurants was overwhelming. Lined on either side of the street (which was a pedestrian street for about a half mile) were either restaurants, hotels, bars, or small shops. In the street was about half the tourists in New Orleans, in various states of drunkenness.<br />
It took me a minute to realize that we were really walking on Bourbon Street. All I had ever heard of the famed road came back to me in a sudden flood, and for a moment I felt a little disappointed. It wasn&#8217;t the Bourbon Street I had pictured in my mind. I guess I should blame my vivid imagination for that. Most of my views came from Sting&#8217;s Moon Over Bourbon Street from his The Dreams of Blue Turtles album. I expected cobblestone roads, gas light lamps, a near constant haze about the streets, dingy little shops and music halls mixed in with small French eateries.<br />
What we got were a few high-rise buildings near Canal Street, a well-paved road, concrete sidewalks, fairly large and clean stores, bars and, restaurants, and completely clear air &#8212; almost the opposite of what I had in mind. One thing that did stand out was the smell &#8212; decaying garbage and vomit. Pretty much what you&#8217;d expect from a heavily used and abused area of the city.<br />
The first restaurant we tried was a more upscale place, which turned people away by politely stating there was a 45 minute wait. This prompted us to walk further east. Oyster bars were prevalent throughout the French Quarter, which I ruled out as a possibility &#8212; there&#8217;s no way in hell they were going to get me to eat a raw oyster. And I wasn&#8217;t too keen on having Stefan and Rebecca load up on aphrodisiacs with me sleeping 10 feet away from them.<br />
Eventually we found a hip little joint called Remoulade. Slightly away from most of the boozers in the road, the little restaurant gave us a little bit of shelter from the storm. I was still a little apprehensive of the place, but in retrospect I was apprehensive about the entire French Quarter. Like Las Vegas, it was a new experience that required a little bit of adjustment for me. It wasn&#8217;t long before I felt at home there.<br />
Our table was closer to the back of the restaurant, but we still had an excellent view of the entire restaurant (complete with pictures of their all-seafood cartoon band) and Bourbon Street. Authentic Naw&#8217;lins (say it aloud, say it proud, and you&#8217;ll discover the &#8220;proper&#8221; pronunciation of the fair city) cuisine was the order of the night: Jambalaya for Stefan, Shrimp Creole for Dhar, Red Beans for Rebecca, and Blackened Chicken for yours truly. The drinks came quickly too &#8212; gin fizz, planters punch, and a long island iced tea.<br />
Not personally fond of mixed drinks, I flipped through the list of beers. Not finding anything that particular thrilled me, I asked the waitress what she recommended. It was then I heard of Abita Turbodog. I had never heard of anything like that before in my life. Mind you, I had only been drinking since late on December 31, 1995 so my experience in beer wasn&#8217;t too in-depth. A little more than curious about the name, I asked what it was. All she had to say was &#8220;dark beer&#8221; to whet my interest.<br />
To this day, I have not had as fine a beer as Abita Turbodog. When the waitress said it was a dark beer, she wasn&#8217;t kidding. The only beverage I&#8217;ve had that comes close is Guinness. But that&#8217;s a stout, and has a much more bitter taste. Turbodog was dark, strong, and smooth. It was a damn good beer, and I&#8217;m disappointed that Abita doesn&#8217;t ship the stuff up here.<br />
The food arrived not long after we had our drinks. I couldn&#8217;t help but stare at the immense pile of orangey-brown rice, shrimp, and vegetables that made jambalaya. Suddenly gathering up enough guts (probably in part to the high alcoholic content of the beer), I asked Stefan if I could snitch one of his shrimp.<br />
To this day my parents testify that when I was a wee babe, I stuffed anything and everything in my mouth. If it was edible (and in a few cases that wasn&#8217;t even necessary), I ate it. As I got older, I started hating things. For a while, there was very little I would willingly eat. I still don&#8217;t like olives, mushrooms, or liver. Of seafood, I only ate fish. That is, until I was tricked into eating linguini with clams. Since then I&#8217;ve also tried cooked oysters (in a stir-fry) and squid. But a shrimp seemed beyond my ability. They just looked too creepy crawly to eat &#8230; kinda like eating a large beetle.<br />
Nevertheless, I stared at the small orange and white curl, opened my mouth, and tossed the sucker in before I could have a second thought. I chewed on it a moment, swallowed, took a swig of beer to counter the sudden burst of fire in my mouth from the Cajun spice in the jambalaya, and announced that it was bearable. I suddenly realized that when my family found out, I&#8217;d never hear the end of it. (My sister especially took fun in bugging me about my little experiment.)<br />
The only complaint of our dinner was Dhar&#8217;s long island iced tea &#8212; it was brutally strong. Being a gentlemen, he swallowed the rest of it without much ado and ordered something different &#8230; a lime daiquiri.<br />
Our meal completed without dessert, there was nothing there that really appealed to me. Of course I was beginning to feel the effects of the beer by that point, which probably affected my judgment. Correction: I know it affected my judgment. Having finished the beer and debating on buying another, the others tried to convince me to have a mixed drink. I had already forgotten the adage: &#8220;Beer then liquor, never sicker&#8221; so I had nothing else to hold me back in my decision (the rest of my higher logic functions having taken a nose dive after the Turbodog).<br />
And so arrived another lime daiquiri. I didn&#8217;t know what to make of it at first, but the taste was something else. I like tart food and drink, so something sour usually appeals to me. I sucked back that alcoholic slushie like it was nothing more than a lime-flavoured ice cone. That was my second bad move for the night (the first having given in to having a mixed drink).<br />
Having only started drinking anything alcoholic at New Year&#8217;s left me with a decidedly significant disadvantage &#8212; I had no tolerance for booze. I would feel a buzz after only one beer. After two I started feeling numbness in my face. After three I couldn&#8217;t feel my nose. After four I couldn&#8217;t walk properly. After five I was a lost cause and needed to be protected (though usually from myself). After one strong beer and a lime daiquiri, I was at the three beer mark.<br />
Actually, I was a little past the three beer mark. I&#8217;d lost some of my coordination, but oddly enough I could still feel most of my face (although it was well numbed). We worked our way back into the street to mingle with the rest of the drunks and wandered around Bourbon Street. I had wished two things almost immediately: 1) that we had arrived a day earlier to catch some of the Jazz Festival, and 2) that I could come back again with my more musically-oriented friends (who lived for that kind of thing). I&#8217;m not saying that Stefan, Dhar, and Rebecca were bad company, just different.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where my memory gets a tad on the cloudy side. I don&#8217;t know exactly what we did after we left Remoulade. All I truly remember was it wasn&#8217;t even 22:00 when we reentered Bourbon Street. We wandered in one (possibly several) directions, looking in stores, bumping into people, and watching some of the oddest behaviour I&#8217;d ever seen.<br />
Take this little game for example: usually occurring at Mardi Gras, this little erotic game involves women exposing their breasts to men, in return for beaded necklaces. Yeah, I know what you&#8217;re thinking: Where do I sign up? I had to admit, I was shocked. All these years of the National Organization for Women cramming down our throats that women are equals, not objects and blah blah blah blah blah. I had accepted all that hot air when I was knee-high to a dust mite! This little act was sending NOW&#8217;s work back 30 years.<br />
Rebecca was particularly interested in the game (she&#8217;d heard of it from a friend of hers, who had participated when she had visited New Orleans), watching the spectacle with keen interest. (I guess this is what sex experts do when they see something sexual. I guess this would also apply to men, who look anyway.) For a brief moment, I actually thought that Rebecca was about to join in the fun. For a brief moment I hoped that she would, if only to see the expression of utter horror on Stefan&#8217;s face.<br />
Voodoo shops are creepy places, and the French Quarter&#8217;s got a few of them. Whether or not the proprietors believe in the religion or not is hard to say, but the signs pasted all around the store seem to indicate as such. Jars of shrunken &#8230; things, voodoo dolls, potions, powders, wands, rubber chickens (don&#8217;t ask me), and a lot of stuff I wasn&#8217;t too comfortable looking at, let alone buying them.<br />
Sex shops abounded in the area, with probable reason. Naturally, tagging along with a sex expert, we had to do some field research. I swear Rebecca sounded like a school girl, giggling at some of the things she hadn&#8217;t seen before. Most of the stuff was old hat for her, she rifled through the clutter like she had intimate knowledge of what the stuff was. Dhar couldn&#8217;t bear being those stores very long, and would quietly leave, waiting for us either on the street or in another store nearby.<br />
The other streets near Bourbon street weren&#8217;t spared our perusal. Heaven only knows how long we stumbled around &#8230; rather, I stumbled around &#8230; until we arrived at the foot of Orleans Avenue. In front of us was St. Anthony&#8217;s Garden, and just past that the St. Louis Cathedral. At night there&#8217;s not a heck of a lot to see, except for a statue.<br />
A simple pose of Jesus Christ with his arms extended. In front of the statue was a bright white light, which when shone at the statue formed an enormous shadow on the front of the cathedral. It was a powerful image, and one that didn&#8217;t escape my camera lens. If I ever return to New Orleans, I intend to retake that picture having had a little more practice at night shots.<br />
We walked hardly a block before we spotted a store where all the merchandise sported a blue dog. I, still under the influence, muttered quite loudly: &#8220;What&#8217;s with the blue dog?!&#8221; We were quickly answered by passing African-American man (also under the influence) who told us the history behind the dog. It was apparently the pet of the owner, also an artist, who began painting a blue likeness of the dog. The locals seemed to like it, and eventually the dog became local lore. Go figure&#8230;<br />
From there we found the building in which the Louisiana Purchase was signed. But I neither remember what the name of the building was nor where it was in the French Quarter. We milled around for a few moments and then headed to Canal Street. We walked up Canal Street back towards Bourbon Street, Dhar and Stefan stopping several times at the closed electronics shops (it was a Sunday, after all). Dhar was keen (bordering on desperate) to buy a new radar detector for his car.<br />
I never really understood the reasoning for a radar detector. Unless you happen to be a professional race car driver, I don&#8217;t see any reason why you should speed excessively. Driving 20 km/h over the speed limit I don&#8217;t consider excessive (seeing as all Canadians seem to do that), but most people buying a radar detector tend to travel much faster than that.<br />
Following more wandering, we eventually found our way back to the parking garage where we left the car. While we waited for the valet to retrieve our vehicle (it was a posh French Quarter hotel, after all), I got a good look around. The most interesting feature of the garage was the lift (you couldn&#8217;t quite call it an elevator). It was a vertical conveyor belt that ran to the upper levels of the garage. Every eight feet or so was a platform that stuck out about a foot. Valets would stand on the platform and be carried upwards. The device was devilishly simple, and judging by the motor running it, also very old. Not terribly safe either, one false move and you could lose a arm or leg &#8230; even a head.<br />
The blue Neon reappearing from the depths (or in our case, heights), we filed back into the car and tried to find our way home. I don&#8217;t know who was navigating (Dhar was driving), but we ended up on a road heading east. Not the proper direction, you say? Correctimundo! We came to the same conclusion when we found the oil refinery. Somehow we got turned around and drove in the opposite direction. That mystery solved, Dhar turned around and got us going the right way.<br />
I don&#8217;t know exactly what route we took, but I think it&#8217;s safe to say we didn&#8217;t take the Interstate. Eventually we found our way back to Jefferson Highway (why do I keep wanting to type &#8216;Jefferson Airplane&#8217;?) which ultimately led us back home to the Behemoth. It was past midnight by the time we got in, and most of the campground had settled in for the night. A few stragglers from the Jazz Festival were still up.<br />
Dhar pulled up in front of the van, and three of us filed out. Dhar then pulled out and drove off, explaining that he wasn&#8217;t tired and wanted to see more of the city. He had pre-purchased his gasoline, and wanted to use as much of it as possible. So he said. If I had been a little more sober, I might have been a little more concerned. But by that time, I was a little more focused on going to sleep.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate Supplementary</strong><br />
Despite a strong beer (#23) and my first lime margarita, I&#8217;m able to write this. Tonight I experienced the French Quarter. Somehow, I had a totally different idea of Bourbon Street than what we found. I ate a shrimp and actually like it &#8211; my parents will be freaked. Dhar went off on us again &#8211; it must be nice to be a vampire&#8230;More and more I hate being single. I need only watch Stef and Rebecca to see what I&#8217;m missing. It&#8217;s become truly sad when the &#8220;jokes&#8221; I make are based in truth.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The morning was cool, but not uncomfortable. Dhar had slept in the navigator&#8217;s chair again, but for once wasn&#8217;t awake before me. Not having relieved myself the night before, my bladder was now rather tight feeling, the call of nature was screaming in my eardrums. As quietly as possible, I climbed out of the van (possible only because Dhar wasn&#8217;t blocking the side doors) and hiked down to the KOA Office.<br />
The KOA office was a fairly large two-storey building. The front was the office itself, facing the road. At the back of the office were the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s washrooms and a pool (also closed for the season). I found this closure rather interesting considering the camp looked rather full, and the limited facilities were sure to cause problems.<br />
I first went to the washroom door to see if it was locked during the day. As I reached it, the door swung open and one of the other KOA guests left. I shoved my foot in the door and headed directly to the urinal. Feeling less pressured and bit lighter, I went around to the other side of the building to find the office.<br />
A husband and wife team ran the camp, the wife sounding like an immigrant from England. I politely asked for the washroom combination so the others could get in when they woke up. I explained that we had arrived during the night, and hadn&#8217;t had a chance to use the facilities yet. (Which was essentially true.) The woman understood completely and provided me with the important information.<br />
By the time I got back the others were rising. It was shower time. I grabbed my things and headed off to cleanse myself of several hundred miles of grime. The showers were best described as &#8220;weird&#8221;: they had all the necessary fixtures, with cinder block dividers between the three stalls. No, that isn&#8217;t the strange part. Unlike all the other places we stopped, the dividers didn&#8217;t extend all the way to the wall, leaving a foot-wide gap and allowing one person to see into the adjacent stall.<br />
Hello? Who on earth would do something like that? More importantly, why?<br />
I took the middle stall (for no particular reason), and was joined on either side by Stefan and Dhar about five minutes later. All three of us joked about the rather odd construction of the showers. Cleaned and dried, I headed back to the van to carry out the rest of the morning&#8217;s duties. These included emptying and refilling the fresh water tanks (the newness of the plastic tended to lend a rather unpleasant taste), getting the seats back in their original positions, and buying more postcards to send home.<br />
Albuquerque isn&#8217;t exactly the garden spot of New Mexico, but it&#8217;s a nice place (I just wouldn&#8217;t want to live there). Trees and small plants gave some shade within the campgrounds (although not a tenth as nice as the campground in Las Vegas, but better than the ones in Colorado), amidst the wilting and dried out grass. But the grass next to the van would look nice within a week or so of us leaving, the additional water would help replenish the moisture.<br />
A knock at one of the doors announced the arrival of one of the KOA staff. He informed us that we moved during the night, to which I vehemently (but politely) insisted we hadn&#8217;t. After a brief explanation of what happened when we arrived, the middle-aged and overweight man apologized, suggesting that someone else had created some confusion, and went off to find out who.<br />
This was only the first encounter of less-than-average intelligence at that KOA that morning. I don&#8217;t know if it was just the staff, or if it was the result of living in New Mexico. Either way, there were some seriously intelligence impaired people working there.<br />
My next encounter was buying postcards. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so bad, but when I got around to buying stamps things went to hell in the proverbial hand-basket. Everywhere else we had been had required $0.40 to send a postcard to Canada. Yet for some reason the English woman insisted that the cost was $0.50. I assumed one of two things: 1) Because of Albuquerque&#8217;s remoteness, the cost was slightly higher, or 2) The cost had gone up in the past couple of days. I pretty much ruled out the second possibility, since Americans would have a fit over a 10 cent increase in postage. The first possibility wasn&#8217;t particular plausible either as far as I was concerned, but an extra $0.40 overall wasn&#8217;t going to destroy my budget.<br />
As it turns out, the stamps were supposed to cost $0.40, as Rebecca found out when she bought stamps about a half hour later. (The woman would later apologize for her mistake.) But I wasn&#8217;t the only one to have to deal with all the strange goings-on that morning. When Stefan went in to get the late check-in squared away, he also had to deal with what appeared to be a rash of moronic behaviour. Some of the aforementioned demeanor was the result of a guest leaving the campground and returning to a different spot, messing up all the scheduling and reservations, and pissing off a motorhome arriving for its reservation.<br />
Breakfast that morning was oranges and the last of our fruity loops (the equally as sugary Kellogg&#8217;s knock-off). Having four people crammed around the table in the back of the van was not a wise idea &#8212; there was hardly any elbow room, virtually no leg room, and if you had to get out you were pretty much screwed unless you were the last person in.<br />
We wasted little time, and pulled out just before 11:00. On directions from the KOA clerks (surprisingly accurate ones), we traveled north along Juan Tabo Boulevard to find the Valvoline lube shop, about a mile or so north of the I-40. Stefan&#8217;s keen eyesight picked it out at a fair distance, and soon enough we were parked around the back waiting our turn in line.<br />
There seemed to be a large number of people wanting to change their oil that morning. I had hoped for a simple drive-in, drive-out spending all of about 20 minutes. Unfortunately there were two cars ahead of us in both bays, meaning that at best we were there for at least 40 minutes. So we sat back, listened to the radio, and waited.<br />
One of the oil jockeys came out after a few minutes and had me fill out some information about the van. This necessitated a quick flip through the owner&#8217;s manual to make sure I got the information correct. Another jockey had an elderly man in a pickup truck and us switch sides to keep the order of first-come, first-serve in perfect shape.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca went off to find coffee and camera film. I needed film, and asked Dhar to grab some for me, and I&#8217;d pay him back later. To keep in check with the film I had used so far, I asked for Kodak film, preferably 400 ASA. I got my 400 ASA, but it was Fuji instead. I don&#8217;t mind Fuji film, but I&#8217;ve always believed Fuji film takes different pictures than Kodak film.<br />
Only moments following Rebecca and Dhar&#8217;s return to the van our turn came for an oil change. Guided by one of the half-dozen high school dropouts (or so their appearance seemed to be) that ran the place, although in a very professional manner, I drove the Behemoth into place over one of the massive oil changing pits. There seemed to be almost a military manner about the way business was carried out: precise motions, strong team dependence, and a curious habit of repeating yelled orders so that every employee was aware of what was going on even if that employee wasn&#8217;t directly involved.<br />
The hood was popped as the oil pan plug was pulled. If there is such a thing as an automotive enema, I&#8217;m certain the Behemoth received one. At first we were all in the van, but almost immediately Stefan and Dhar climbed out to watch the lube jockeys go through their steps.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960427.1175</strong><br />
<em>Day 7</em><br />
We hit Albuquerque late last night and actually managed to sleep in for a change &#8211; 8:45 to be specific. Three hours later, we&#8217;re now changing oil. After that, we&#8217;re getting abducted by aliens. We might get to San Antonio tonight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>My father was very specific about the type of oil that was used in any of our family vehicles &#8212; always 15W40 grade. Neither Stefan or Dhar (acknowledged automotive fanatics) could understand it, neither did any of the lube jockeys. To be honest, I never did either. All I knew is that the oil my dad usually put in was made for diesel engines and was excellent at keeping the carbon levels low.<br />
But in the heat of the south, 15W40 is hardly ever used. The most popular grades were literally kept on tap &#8212; three gas pump-style hoses provided quick and easy access to refills. Our rather odd order had to be yelled down to the storage area (although yelled all over the garage at the same time, as if in disbelief that some yahoo was actually ordering such a thick oil), and five quart bottles had to be tossed up.<br />
Everything that moved was greased. Every fluid level was checked. The filters were changed. While we waited for the last of the bottles to be filled, one of the station&#8217;s employees struck up conversation (almost unavoidable when you&#8217;re driving a motorhome with Ontario license plates). Mostly where we had been and where we were going &#8212; standard fare for us by that point. Then he asked us who we thought was going to win the Stanley Cup that year.<br />
Although I immediately answered: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t a clue!&#8221;, it took me only a moment to realize the irony of the situation. Here I was, a devout Canadian, from what many believe to be the true home of ice hockey, and I don&#8217;t follow what many would call our national pastime. (As a side note &#8212; hockey is so popular that the theme for CBC&#8217;s Hockey Night In Canada has been repeatedly recommended as our new national anthem, mostly because O Canada doesn&#8217;t sound good at hockey games.) I was in a state where the only ice they probably saw was floating in drinks, yet they eagerly watched hockey.<br />
I guess I&#8217;ve always had this odd objection to warm climates taking a liking to ice hockey. I have this peculiar train-of-thought that says places like Dallas, Miami, and Los Angeles should never be allowed to have a hockey team, especially when needy cold places like Quebec City are more deserving. In my opinion, any place that doesn&#8217;t see snow for more than two months of the year should not be allowed to have an ice hockey team. Yes, I know that proper conditions can easily be maintained in arenas, but that&#8217;s beside the point. It&#8217;s the principle of the matter. Ice is nice.<br />
Anyway, a few minutes later and a $25 charge to my VISA card, we hit the road to see if we could get abducted by aliens. Our major destination of the day was Roswell, about 200 miles south-east of Albuquerque.<br />
For those of you not familiar with the name Roswell, you probably don&#8217;t follow UFO lore. In 1947 newspaper headlines touted the crash of an unidentified flying object &#8212; the first, and most certainly not the last (though probably the most credible) report of any such incident from 1947 to the present day. Theories abound as to what happened. Some, like the US Army, contend that the object was a weather balloon. Others think it was one of the number &#8220;black projects&#8221; the United States government ran (and still run). But X-Files diehards (referred to as X-Philes &#8230; pun intended, I assume) and UFO-ologists believe that the object was a spacecraft of some kind. Many reports also seemed to indicate that passengers were recovered from the ship. But this much is known: the government denies anything other than a weather balloon crashed outside Roswell.<br />
Mind you, until 1995 the United States government also denied the existence of Area 51, a not-so-secret Air Force base at Groom Lake in Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. This is despite many photographs and video, Russian satellite photos, and large groups of people who go to the site to watch &#8220;black projects&#8221; go through their paces. Many in-the-know also believe the crashed UFO and some fully-functional UFOs are stationed at the Groom Lake facility.<br />
I resumed my stint behind the wheel, and we pulled back onto the I-40. This time we headed west again for brief time, until we picked up the I-25 going south. This was by far the easiest and the fastest route, taking about an hour and fifteen minutes to reach Socorro. From there we would take Highway 380 to Roswell. Socorro was also known for some rather interesting activities in the night sky, all denied by the government, of course.<br />
Despite the general lack of just about anything interesting in New Mexico, we managed to find a few objects and places that put the state in my &#8220;Strange Places To Visit&#8221; category (reports of UFOs aside). For starters, there&#8217;s the prison warning signs along the road. We missed the first one we passed, I barely got a good look at it. But we pulled over at the next one we found so I could get a good picture of it:<br />
<q>Do not pick up hitchhikers. Prison facilities.</q>Never before had I seen anything like that. I haven&#8217;t seen anything like that out of New Mexico ever since. Along that same stretch of the I-25, I also saw a VW Bug. Remember them? Yes, I know that&#8217;s not impressive, and I totally agree. The fact that this VW had an enormous pair of bull horns mounted to the roof completely amazed me. Not only did they look absolutely ludicrous on the tiny vehicle, they must&#8217;ve constituted a safety hazard in the event of a car crash.<br />
The desert opened before us very quickly, leaving only the brown and beige vastness to see. The only break in the monotony was the Rio Grande, which the I-25 ran along side. On the banks of the mighty river stood luscious trees and large bushes. The vegetation seemed to form an impenetrable wall, preventing the harsh conditions of the New Mexico wasteland from harming the delicate life giver.<br />
When we turned east onto Highway 380, that little slice of green quickly disappeared behind us. I expected us to start crossing through sandy desert at that point, but was surprised to find many low hills and shallow valleys rippled the land before us. The only indication that we were in or at least very near a desert were a few signs that warned of sandstorms in the area.<br />
But perhaps the most serious sign that we saw was for the White Sands Missile Range. More secretive government work, yes, but not the most significant reason &#8230; at least not for me. I knew that somewhere to the south of Highway 380 was the location of the infamous Trinity Site. There, in the early hours of July 16, 1945, humanity decided to try to beat God at His own game and crack the atom. For a brief instant the sky became brighter than day, and the nuclear age began.<br />
I wanted to see the site. But the AAA TourBook indicated that only two tours were made each year: one at the beginning of April, and one at the beginning of October. The Trinity Site is in the northern end of the White Sands Missile Range, but may still be in an active fire zone. Another possibility is lingering radioactivity, fatal to prolonged repeated exposure.<br />
New Mexico is the birthplace of Smokey the Bear. How did we find this out? We passed by the Smokey Bear Historical State Park. Several signs hinted at a monument of some kind that told the story of the Great Firestomper, but we never found it.<br />
We stumbled across another rather interesting curiousity somewhere between Capitan and Picacho, a distance of about 29 miles. One minute we were passing through a sea of dust, sand and small dark green shrubs, the next minute we were surrounded by a basalt lava flow. All around us was a massive black bumpy patch of rock. We pulled over for a moment t get a good look at it, to make sure we weren&#8217;t seeing things.<br />
Another reason we pulled over was to see if we could find a replacement for our lava rocks in the barbeque. The ones that were supplied with our little grill were horrible, barely large enough to keep from falling between the cracks (and sometimes not). But almost as soon as we pulled into what appeared to be a state park entrance, we saw the rules posted in large friendly letters for all to see: &#8220;Do not remove any rocks from this area.&#8221;<br />
So we pulled back out onto the road. But I pulled out a little too quick, and the CD player slid off the &#8220;doghouse&#8221; (the &#8220;doghouse&#8221; is an extension of the engine housing into the passenger compartment, creating a large bulge between the driver and navigator) and smashed into the floor, breaking the lid off. I was a little annoyed, mostly at myself for pulling out so fast. Fortunately, Dhar the engineer fixed our music supply and returned it to working order. One thing I&#8217;ll say for Sony, their CD players will take a burning, and keep on turning.<br />
A little under a half hour later, we entered Roswell. We didn&#8217;t know when we entered Roswell, as there weren&#8217;t any &#8220;Welcome to Roswell&#8221; signs. Less than a quarter mile after entering what I assume to be the city limits, we found ourselves in a time machine set for the 1950&#8217;s. It seemed aliens had taken over the city and prevented the citizens from building anything new.<br />
Despite the marker of a major city on the New Mexico map, Roswell was really nothing more than a large town of some 45,000 people buried in the middle of the New Mexico desert. Highway 380 formed one of two main roads running through Roswell, the other being Highway 285. Where they crossed, the intersection almost resembled one out of a major city &#8230; only without the traffic. It was one of a small number of intersections with traffic lights.<br />
Roswell seemed dead. There was hardly any life to the place whatsoever &#8212; virtually no moving cars, hardly any pedestrians, no animals or birds that we could see or hear. Even the vegetation looked stunted. Another temporal distortion seemed to surround the city, just like the one in Kansas, only not as severe. Even our breathing seemed to slow slightly. Little did we know that we found the home of unconcern, stoicism, and apathy.<br />
What we were looking for, we didn&#8217;t know. Asking someone about the UFO crash would illicit one of two responses: annoyance (derived from all the other curiousity seekers&#8217; constant badgering), or bewilderment at such a stupid question. So we simply drove along Highway 380 looking for something, anything, that might give a hint as to Roswell&#8217;s infamous past.<br />
In a motion that was nearly suggestive of pregnancy, Rebecca declared that she wanted ice cream. I say &#8216;nearly&#8217; because I was also guilty of such a declaration (even if I didn&#8217;t vocalize it), and medical science still hasn&#8217;t caused pregnancy in men. But do you think that we could find a single ice cream parlour? What it was with Southerners, I don&#8217;t know, but they seemed to have some strange aversion to cold foods.<br />
Before we knew it, the desert reappeared. Half of us wanted to go back to Roswell, and half of us wanted to go forward. So we compromised and continued going forward for a little while. The eastern side of Roswell was certainly more scenic than the western side, but when you compare a scraggly shrub to nothing, the difference is still significant (at least in a mathematical sense). After a few minutes we stumbled across the Bottomless Lakes State Park. The arrival of the dinner hour elicited a group decision to find a place to settle down and eat, and the park seemed as good a place as any.<br />
We turned onto the park road and started driving down its long, winding route. We drove for what seemed like endless miles. We began to wonder if the park had any lakes at all, if they had dried up like all the rivers we had seen in our travels through the dry states. Turn after turn, bend after bend, mile after mile, and nothing but some short grasses and bracken.<br />
But as we rounded a hill after about ten minutes, a body of water came into view. It looked like there was maybe two feet of water in the deepest portion. Evaporation had left huge white and gold rings of mineral deposits where the water had one been. It probably couldn&#8217;t support any life, partly hinted at by the lack of vegetation around the pond (which was pretty much what it was by that point). The park was rapidly beginning to be known as &#8220;Lakeless Bottom&#8221;.<br />
But we did eventually find it, about a mile away from the other lake bed. Oddly enough though, we didn&#8217;t immediately see it &#8212; it was surrounded. On the north side of the lake was a steep cliff. On the west side were trees just tall enough to shield our view. On the east and south sides was a picnic cum trailer park the state park service had erected. Unlike most of the other parks we had visited thus far (excluding the ones containing historical sites), this had a pay-for-use system &#8230; even if you only wanted to use the picnic area. We weren&#8217;t too keen on this aspect, so promptly turned around and hit the road again.<br />
In a few minutes we found ourselves at the top of the cliff on the north side of the lake, and received our first good look. Barely larger than the other dried-up lake we had seen earlier, some 100 to 150 metres in diametre and roughly circular in size, the lake would be considered a pond in most circles. As to its claim as being bottomless, we couldn&#8217;t really tell. It was a dark lake, but even a shallow lake can look dark.<br />
At any rate, the spot was a good place to have dinner. It was a gravel-laid lookout point for the lake next to the park road, surrounded with chain-link fencing to keep visitors from falling down the 80 metre cliff to what would probably be certain death.<br />
I hopped out the driver&#8217;s door, flipped up the running board flap, and turned on the propane. Rebecca delegated herself to cooking dinner &#8212; spaghetti with some mighty spicy tomato sauce. While we ate, several vehicles pulled up, usually families, to look over the cliff to the tiny lake below. Several families of flies visited us directly, an annoyance we could have done without.<br />
Just as we were finishing, a police car showed up. I began to panic. If this doesn&#8217;t say why I don&#8217;t like colouring outside the lines, I don&#8217;t know what does. I&#8217;ve been paranoid of the police for years, and I really don&#8217;t know why. I guess I was frightened that the police would come over and declare we were not supposed to be there, nail us with a large fine, and suddenly decide to search the van. In doing so they&#8217;d stumble across something that wasn&#8217;t supposed to be there, they&#8217;d confiscate the van, and I&#8217;d disappear into some deep dark prison never to see the light of day, and become the plaything for some a 230-pound rapist and mass murderer named Bubba.<br />
Yes, my mind wanders frequently. I often worry that one day, when I&#8217;m not attentive, it will wander into the road and get squished. Then I&#8217;d be in trouble&#8230;<br />
The cops sat there in the patrol car, looking in our general direction, then after a few moments drove off. I breathed a sigh of relief, much to the curiousity of the others, who hadn&#8217;t come close to being fazed by the presence of the long arm of the law.<br />
The dishes and the pots were cleaned, the leftovers heaved in a nearby dumpster. While Dhar and I got the van ready to be rolled out again, Stefan and Rebecca shared a moment outside, staring into the impending sunset, into the vastness of the American south-west.<br />
For some reason unknown to me then, and still a mystery to me now, I wanted to keep driving. It wasn&#8217;t that I hadn&#8217;t tired of driving &#8212; I actually wanted to keep driving. I don&#8217;t know why. But little argument was raised, so I resumed my position and we headed on our way out of the park. Fortunately the way out was much shorter than the way in.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan took refuge in &#8220;their&#8221; place in the back, Dhar rode shotgun. As we reentered Roswell, Stefan came forward and asked quietly if we could keep an eye open for any place that sold ice cream. (He wanted to make sure Rebecca&#8217;s desires were fulfilled.) It was a difficult request to fill, as there were no ice cream parlours of any kind to be found.<br />
No ice cream parlours, but that bastion of American cheap food, brusque service, and blatant commercialism happened to have a branch office in Roswell. We pulled into the McParking Lot(r), went in through the McDoors(r), and waited in the McLobby(r) so one of the under-paid McEmployees(r) with over-applied McMakeup(r) could take our McOrders(r).<br />
Several years ago, the Canadian branches of the McFranchise(r) had switched from milk-based ice cream and milkshakes to low fat versions. This meant the ice cream was now frozen yogurt, something which I considered so artificial I was never keen on eating it. However, in a trip to TCBY a couple years following the switch, I found I didn&#8217;t mind it so much. Ever since, I&#8217;d made quick work of the McHot Fudge Sundaes(r).<br />
What the American branches of the McFranchise(r) use, I have no clue. All I do know is that the McHot Fudge Sundae(r) certainly didn&#8217;t taste like a McHot Fudge Sundae(r). It might have been the fact that the McServer(r) had to scoop the McFudge(r) out of the McDispenser(r) when the McPump(r) broke. Her hand was coated with the chocolate goop, and said goop didn&#8217;t appear normal &#8230; at least to me.<br />
Complaints aside, Rebecca&#8217;s craving was diminished, if not satisfied, and our mission to Roswell had come to a close. Still retaining the driver&#8217;s seat, I took us out of the McParking Lot(r) and drove to Highway 285 for our trip into Texas.<br />
We still hadn&#8217;t quite figured out what we were going to do in Texas. One thing we had all wanted to do was find a beach on the Gulf of Mexico and spend the day soaking in the sun&#8217;s harmful rays, receiving sand mite bites, sucking in polluted salt water, and paying too much for a watered-down Coke. To do this, we were going to drive through the night until we got to Houston, at which point we would head south to the beach. I kept suggesting we visit the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, but received only lukewarm response. This was the extent of our planning.<br />
First things first however, and we still had 92 miles until we even entered the Lone Star State, let alone set course for the beach. The sun was scraping the horizon as we drove south. The sunset was like nothing we had seen on the trip to that point (nor would we see anything like it during the rest of the trip). As it set, the light on the horizon showed us a landscape so flat, it looked almost like a totally calm and smooth lake &#8212; perfectly flat, save for the odd bush that created a small bump. But unlike Arizona or Kansas, the flatness didn&#8217;t bother me. It was oddly calming &#8230; though I wouldn&#8217;t want to see it every day.<br />
With the coming of night came a better view of what was on the horizon. Sounds strange, doesn&#8217;t it? Throughout most of New Mexico that we saw, and probably a good chunk of Texas, were oil wells. Okay, maybe that doesn&#8217;t sound too spectacular, but as you travel down Highway 285, bright spots appear on that flat distant line. Oil wells and refineries, their lights burning through the night sky. The wind only confirmed our conclusions, the smell of petrochemicals could be easily smelled even as far as 60 miles away.<br />
Each night in Carlsbad, about an hour south of Roswell, there is a spectacle that draws huge crowds. At one of the natural entrances to the Carlsbad Caverns, millions of insect-eating bats take to the sky at sunset to feed. Seeing Carlsbad Caverns would have been an interesting addition to the day, and I so desperately wanted to see the bats. Unfortunately for me, and for all of us, the sun had fully set by the time we were less than 30 minutes from Carlsbad. No bats that night.<br />
Or so I thought. In the New Mexico desert, even on a clear night the amount of ambient light is pretty minimal (at least from inside a vehicle). Things along the roads are pretty hard to see. As we reached the area of Carlsbad Caverns, we encountered a few fledermaus. At first it was just glimpses of the winged mice as they avoided colliding with the Behemoth. But a couple of the more adventurous types decided to settle in the roads looking for a meal. I&#8217;m not scared of bats, but when one of those suckers takes off a few feet in front as you travel at 65 mph towards it, you&#8217;re bound to be a little startled.<br />
But nothing was nearly as nail-biting as our encounter of the fuzzy kind. Jack rabbits. Hundreds of them lined the highway. We didn&#8217;t notice them until one shot in front of the van as it crossed to the east side of the roadway. Dhar and I immediately developed rabbit radar, constantly scanning for the furry little buggers. I love nature, I don&#8217;t like driving over top of it, or smacking into it snapping vertebrae.<br />
At first, we thought it was just one or two. But after a couple minutes, we saw hundreds of green glowing eyes peering back from the scraggly grass at the sides of the highway. If we had been characters in a Stephen King novel, I&#8217;d be scared out of my wits at the sight of all those bewitched bunnies. The odd one would hop around, but for some reason most stared at us as we drove by. I suppose it&#8217;s the old &#8220;caught in the headlights&#8221; shtick, but that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that it&#8217;s still creepy. I could almost hear Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;good evening&#8221; echo in the van.<br />
We weren&#8217;t the only ones who knew the jack rabbits were there &#8212; we spotted a wily coyote prowling for dinner. I figured that with that many rabbits, he (or she) shouldn&#8217;t have too much trouble getting a bite to eat.<br />
The rabbits continued to the New Mexico / Texas border, then seemed to vanish. As we crossed into our 11th state of the trip, Rebecca promptly asked if we had been abducted by aliens. According to our clocks, no time had passed. I couldn&#8217;t find any hole in my memory, nor could anyone else. We all sighed dejectedly &#8212; nobody wanted us.<br />
Highway 285 started into a south-easterly direction once inside Texas. By this time, it was so dark the only way we knew we were in Texas was the sign welcoming us, and the dual speed limits: one for cars, and another for trucks driving at night. At first I assumed that the limits were only for the state highways, since they weren&#8217;t as well protected from animals as the Interstates. As it turned out, the limits were universal.<br />
Then one of the possible reasons came to light &#8212; deer. In Canada, large animals are a problem when driving through the boonies at night. If you&#8217;re not careful, you can say good-bye to your car, and if you&#8217;re particularly unlucky, your life. Moose are the worst problem, they&#8217;ll demolish large buses and walk away unscathed. Deer tend to explode a little more on contact, but are capable of a great deal of damage.<br />
We Canucks are very aware of these dangers (as a country of barely 28 million people and huge expanses of wilderness, we tend to be fairly in touch with nature), but Texans probably need to be reminded that they&#8217;re not invulnerable (as if The Alamo wasn&#8217;t enough of an explanation). Dhar and I still had our radar on full, so we felt pretty safe as we traveled towards the I-10.<br />
I drove until we arrived in Fort Stockton, where we picked up the I-10. It was only our second sign of civilization since Carlsbad. There we filled up with fuel before continuing our trek across Texas. The Flying J gas and convenience stores were becoming a regular sight to us. We could fill up not only on gas, but also on drinks and food for our seemingly endless driving.<br />
Most people told us that the driving would be hell, and we&#8217;d hate all the driving we were doing. To me, that wasn&#8217;t the case. Okay, Kansas and Arizona were hell, but beyond that the driving was actually fairly interesting &#8212; we were seeing parts of the continents we had never seen before. In only a week we had traveled through half a dozen different climates, each one containing a unique beauty.<br />
Texas seemed to have a climate very different from New Mexico. At Fort Stockton, we were over 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, yet the air was terribly sticky from the humidity. This was a new experience for me. Sure, I&#8217;d been to Florida before (see [[Music Trip to Orlando, Introduction|Music Trip to Orlando]]) and felt the ocean&#8217;s influence on the moisture in the air, but Florida is less than 200 miles wide and surrounded by massive bodies of water. Fort Stockton is very much land-locked. I never once expected the air to be so humid so far away from water. If anything, the trip was also becoming very educational.<br />
The gas wasn&#8217;t terribly cheap, but we now knew the reasons why. I paid for the gas (having to turn over my credit card even before beginning to pump gas) while the others made use of the restrooms and purchased more supplies for the odyssey. Then it was my turn to get some sleep. I had been driving for over 10 hours that day, and I was exhausted.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Roswell was uneventful. If we did get abducted, we don&#8217;t remember. We had dinner at Bottomless Lake, which for a while we thought was Lakeless Bottom. (This was partly due to the sheer number of dry river beds we&#8217;ve seen.)Dhar and I navigated through several miles of vicious Texas jack rabbits, vampire bats, wily coyotes and a few of Bambi&#8217;s relatives on our way into Texas. We&#8217;re about 5 hours or so outside of San Antonio.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I awoke to a vaguely disturbing dream about sirens, manifested by emergency vehicles running up and down Las Vegas Boulevard, just in front of our 16th floor window. No sooner than my head cleared enough for me to realize I was awake that I heard a familiar whirring and buzzing, followed by a sharp shutter click and another quick whir. I suddenly realized with a bit of dread that Dhar had just taken my picture. I immediately flipped him my middle finger in response. His response was a cheery &#8220;Too late!&#8221; Stefan and Rebecca fell victim to our early-morning shutterbug a few seconds later.<br />
We moved surprisingly quick that morning, it took half as long to get Rebecca out of bed. We were showered and ready to go downstairs less than forty-five minutes, leaving us an hour and a half before we planned to check out, at 11:30. Prior to leaving for breakfast, we made certain that we packed up all our belongings so all we would have to do is grab our bags and exit the premises. I filled out an &#8220;Express Check Out&#8221; card that I left at Registration just before breakfast, avoiding the hassle of standing in line.<br />
Breakfast was at the buffet, after a ten minute lineup. Rebecca held our places in line while I ventured off to find a bank machine and obtain some cash. I wasn&#8217;t certain whether my card would be able to access the CIBC network properly or not, but I figured it was worth a shot. Figuring that I had spent only $100 in the first five days, I thought another $100 should get me a fair distance further. The machine spat out $100 a moment later.<br />
It spat out a $100 bill. At first I stared at the machine, wondering what moron would fill a bank machine with such large denominations. I actually slapped my forehead when I realized that I was in a casino, where this sort of thing was normal. But $100 was too much for me to carry around as a single banknote. I asked a nearby security guard where I could break the bill into smaller denominations. His look seemed to indicate that he thought I was a moron, but he pointed at the change booth positioned conveniently behind the bank machine. I slapped my forehead again.<br />
Returning to the buffet restaurant, I couldn&#8217;t find Rebecca, Stefan, or Dhar. The latter two appeared a moment later, having browsed a couple slot machines while I was getting money. As it turned out, Stefan was getting money too, winning $6. We ended up having to go in through the exit line to get to Rebecca. A moment later we were sitting at a booth at the back of the room, right next to the buffet tables.<br />
There was only a momentary pause before Stefan and I laid siege to the food. At all-you-can-eat buffets, some people make repeated trips, bringing back small portions of food each time. Stefan and I subscribe to a different philosophy: repeated trips waste calories &#8230; get it all the first time. Being buffet food, I didn&#8217;t expect a gourmet-quality repast, but for a breakfast it wasn&#8217;t too bad. What our breakfast lacked in quality, the buffet made up for with variation &#8212; cereal, fruit, steak, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, ham, hash browns &#8230; an endless sea of morning fare.<br />
We still had 45 minutes of free time before our planned exodus, so we decided to spend the time browsing around. This effectively split the four of us up with Stefan, Rebecca, and Dhar heading to the casino floor, and myself avoiding it. I was getting over my case of Lasvegasitis, and the constant binging and chiming was beginning to grate on my nerves. I opted to do some window shopping instead.<br />
I was determined to leave with some reminder of our stay at Treasure Island, but very little appealed to me. A few years earlier, I would&#8217;ve bought up half a store &#8230; I guess age does affect what you think is neat. At any rate, I browsed through every store in Treasure Island two or three times before visiting another store on an upper level, near the tram to Mirage and the walkway to the parking garage. There I managed to find a dark aquamarine baseball cap with a simple logo on the front.<br />
In finding the illusive store, I also found a piece of technology that I had heard about a couple years earlier on one of the many technology shows I watched on TV. On the escalator leading to the next floor up, riders pass by a large video wall. This in itself isn&#8217;t anything extraordinary, but if you look close you&#8217;ll see directional microphones suspended from the ceiling and jutting from the walls.<br />
Together these elements are used to create an interactive computer effect. Somewhere deep inside Treasure Island is a computer room, and in this room a performer straps himself into a movement apparatus called a &#8220;waldo&#8221;. On the video wall the performer&#8217;s movements become a computer animated cartoon pirate, the voice also supplied by the performer. The microphones pick up the voices of the escalator riders, essentially allowing the performer to have a conversation with the riders. Unfortunately the system was either no longer used, or wasn&#8217;t on during the time I was traveling up and down the escalator.<br />
Just under 45 minutes later I was back in the room, the others waiting for my arrival. We spent little time packing up our things for our journey to the Behemoth. Returning to the lobby, we opted to go out via the parking garage instead of out the front entrance. Dhar commented on the way that the incessant tones of the slots were driving him mad. I knew exactly what he meant.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960426.115</strong><br />
<em>Day 6</em><br />
Leaving Las Vegas. It&#8217;s an interesting place, but only in small doses. Besides, there are a great many more things to see&#8230;<br />
The Hoover Dam is up next, we should be in Albuquerque by tonight.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the already hot temperatures, the van was actually fairly cool inside, thanks to the power of the almighty ceiling fan. We stored our gear, checked the oil, and fired up the engine. While we were waiting for the engine to warm up, I checked the battery power to see how much it had been drained in the 20 or so hours we had left it unplugged. Surprisingly, the level wasn&#8217;t terribly low.<br />
It became fairly apparent why the level was so high when I checked the fridge &#8230; it was still set for 110 volt power. I had forgotten to change the power to 12 volt when we left the KOA the day before. I immediately set the fridge for 12 volt to keep it from getting any warmer, and prayed that what perishable food we had in there wouldn&#8217;t go bad.<br />
That problem aside, we pulled out of the parking lot and hit the road. We traveled north on Las Vegas Boulevard to pick up with Highway 93, which would take us back to the Hoover Dam. Along the way we stopped at the Graceland Chapel so Stefan could take a picture of Dhar and Rebecca in front of it. I waited in the van since they were only gone a few minutes. That act started a rash of jokes about Dhar being married to Rebecca. Interestingly enough, the jokes didn&#8217;t seem to bug Stefan much.<br />
And so we hit our first batch of real traffic. Like many places we had traveled through thus far, Las Vegas was doing construction work on the highway, and it was completely tying up traffic. Normally, I hate traffic. I hate it so much I now refuse to drive into Toronto unless it can&#8217;t be avoided (or I know the traffic will be light). But even though I was behind the wheel that morning, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered. About 20 minutes after entering the mess, we were clear on our way.<br />
Nevada looks very different in the day &#8212; mostly brown and beige with a few splotches of green. Leftovers of the Rocky Mountains and its foothills give some texture to the land. Fortunately, the 30 miles from Las Vegas to the Hoover Dam go by fairly quickly.<br />
This time Dhar and Rebecca were awake, and duly impressed with the gorge as we started to travel down the west side of the valley. Although Stefan and I got a good look at the dam some 36 hours earlier, daylight cast a whole new perspective on the massive structure.<br />
We parked in a newly-built parking garage on the Nevada side and strolled across Highway 93 (reduced to a two lane road with a speed maximum of 15 miles an hour) to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. We immediately signed up for a tour of the dam, at a cost of five dollars apiece. At the time I considered this a reasonable price, even if the actual tour didn&#8217;t last as long as I thought it would have.<br />
Starting at the top of the dam, we had to travel down about 600 feet to the river level. The tour group numbered about 50 to 60 people, which could be accommodated in the two immense elevators. Each of the two cars in the cylindrical shaft could carry at least 30 people, and probably closer to 50. (When you&#8217;re crammed in like sardines, trying not to grope the person next to you by accident, and ignoring the increasing heat, you tend not to notice the precise number of people in the elevator.)<br />
At the bottom we were quickly shuffled out to the balcony of the Nevada-side generating bay. Four American football fields in length, the bay was an impressive construction. Eight massive turbine-powered generators ran the length of the bay, with a much smaller ninth generator near the front, providing power for the dam&#8217;s offices, elevators, lights and so forth.<br />
A few minutes of speech from our tour guide (who constantly stepped over her own words and could barely be heard even with the use of a PA system), and she led us down a flight of stairs to the generator bay floor, and out a door to the outside. We were now where the water from the reservoir exited from the penstocks back into the Colorado River. Behind us was the towering dam, an awesome sight from below.<br />
Here we were shown the transformers which took the raw power from the generators and sent it into the electrical grid. The electrical cables ran almost straight up the side of the canyon walls to towers that stood out almost on a 90 degree angle, then into Nevada. The same setup existed on the Arizona side. The wires criss-crossing the valley seemed to form an immense spider&#8217;s web. Only here, it would be the web that killed you, not the spider.<br />
Following a quick schpeal about the transformers, the guide went on to discuss the dam itself. I already knew a fair bit from documentaries I had seen, but seeing it on TV and seeing it in reality are two totally different things. On TV, it seems like an everyday occurrence. Standing about 30 feet above the Colorado River, staring nearly 700 feet to the top of the dam is an unbelievable sight. The dam is so massive that engineers estimate that barring any major catastrophe (such as earthquake registering over 8 on the Richter scale), the dam should last about 2,000 years. Had I heard that on the documentaries, I would&#8217;ve passed it off as over-confidence. Having actually seen it, I think the estimate&#8217;s a bit low.<br />
Dhar had been a little preoccupied with crossing the dam the first time, afraid that it might crack beneath us. Now at the bottom of the gorge, he was even more concerned. Even I was a little apprehensive. But one of the dam&#8217;s design features made Dhar all the more paranoid &#8230; it leaked. At the seams of the concrete forms, you could see the dark telltale marks of water seepage. Another tourist in our group asked about that, the tour guide promised it was designed that way.<br />
The last stop of the tour was some 200 feet into the canyon wall. Here we were led into a room that overlooked the massive penstock pipes. These pipes came down from the intake towers in the reservoir, delivering water to the generator turbines. Some 30 or 40 feet in diametre, and using pins (rivets) that were six inches across, the pipes contained water under so much pressure that the room we stood in vibrated &#8230; and it wasn&#8217;t even directly connected to the pipe.<br />
Here the guide told us how the water is delivered from Lake Mead to the generators, and how the water was diverted while the dam was under constructions. Another interesting fact of Hoover Dam: it has two spillways, designed to take in water in the event of a flash flood. The spillways are each large enough to contain the volume of water that goes over Niagara Falls in one second (5520 cubic metres, or about 194,940 cubic feet).<br />
The tour thus ended. I was a little disappointed that we had seen all there was to see. I wanted to see the control room, or something else that&#8217;s usually &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221;. We were led back to the elevators to take us back to the Visitor&#8217;s Center. We opted not to see the documentary film, but decided to check out the dam for ourselves. We found our way to the Lake Mead side of the dam, where we found a gift shop. Finally I had found tacky stuff. And by tacky, I am referring to mounted heads of the illusive jackalope (a jack rabbit with antelope horns glued on for show).<br />
I purchased a rather huge mug (the only truly tacky thing that I bought during the trip) and a rock from the canyon to give to my soon-to-be-ex-manager at a job I would quit a few days after returning home. (A very long story, summarized in that the job I was supposed to get ended up going to someone else, and I was going to be bussing tables, through no fault of my own. Thanks, but no thanks.) The rock was supposed to be from the Grand Canyon, but I had forgotten to get one. The rock here looked similar in formation (an advantage of having taken geology courses), so I figured I would at least try to pass it off. (I never did find out if she got the rock or not.)<br />
The time came for us to hit the road again, and start gaining hours as we headed east. Stefan and Rebecca went back for the van while Dhar and I walked to Arizona, taking pictures as we went. I finished off the last of a roll of film (as did Dhar), and I took a couple pictures with my panoramic camera. Part of the way across we came by a restroom, which I desperately needed to make use of.<br />
Most of the architecture of the dam was art deco, the style commonly used in the 1930&#8217;s, when the dam was built. Even the washrooms retained the style &#8230; the toilets actually looked like the ones installed in the 1930&#8217;s. I couldn&#8217;t help but comment on this to Dhar when I came out.<br />
A few minutes later we stood on the Arizona side waiting for Rebecca and Stefan to drive by. They barely stopped, just long enough for us to dive in the side door before continuing on. Our next intended stop was to be in Flagstaff.<br />
My dad had drilled into me for years that engine oil needed to be changed every 5,000 kilometres, no matter what. The Behemoth would hit the mark just outside of Flagstaff, making it the ideal place to get an oil change. But first we had to cross over three and a half hours of Arizona, and it was already 14:00 Mountain time.<br />
We drove down to Kingman again, pausing only long enough to hop from Highway 93 to the I-40 to head east. The trip was fairly uneventful, we found various ways to amuse ourselves including playing Stefan&#8217;s favourite song, Sugar Sugar. (This was from my Saturday Morning CD, a compilation of themes from old Saturday morning cartoon shows, remade by current alternative bands.) Previously a song from the Archies, Sugar Sugar was remade by Mary Lou Lord with Semisonic. It was just as sugary-sweet as the original song (no pun intended), and just as evilly catchy. Several times Stefan would unconsciously start humming it, which led to at least one other person humming it, which lead to someone realizing that it was being hummed, which led to conscious thought and the realization that the song was actually very annoying.<br />
We had a reasonably extensive CD collection with us, most of them from my &#8220;store&#8221;. I use the term as a result of all the chiding I received from my friends. At the time of the trip, I had in excess of 435 CDs. An impressive collection perhaps, but no more so than a few people I know who have over 1,200 CDs in addition to endless boxes of LPs and the few hundred-odd cassette tapes.<br />
Long before my family had even bought the Behemoth, I had sent a request to Stefan and Rebecca to decide what music to listen to, sending them a list of every album I owned. I personally had no qualms about what they chose &#8212; my logic was straightforward, whatever they wanted to listen I owned anyway. After a bit of prodding I finally got a list in return that contained what I would consider &#8220;easy-listening&#8221; music. What I didn&#8217;t know was that they listened to music that was as every bit as harsh as some of the music I listened to, and we had many similarities in our likes and dislikes. In theory, I could have grabbed a bunch of CDs at random and it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered.<br />
To give you an idea of what we did listen to, here&#8217;s the list:</p>

<p>There were several other CDs in the pack I brought along, but we never got a chance to listen to them. Several of the albums were chosen by me for a specific contribution to the trip: theme music. ZZ Top was included for their rendition of Viva Las Vegas. The Tragically Hip supplied New Orleans Is Sinking. REM gave us Drive. Unfortunately I had neglected to bring Sheryl Crow (Leaving Las Vegas), any Elvis albums, Paul Simon (Graceland), or Phil Collins (Take Me Home).<br />
About a third of the way across Arizona, we realized our gasoline supply was dwindling fast. We also knew that the western end of Arizona had much higher gas prices than the eastern end. We tried our best to keep the supply running as long as we could, but soon it became all too clear that no matter what we did, we needed fuel and we needed it quickly.<br />
We pulled off at Seligman, some tiny speck on the map, where we hoped there would be an open gas bar. We crossed to the north side of I-40, and turned east onto a small road. Turning left, we headed over to a dusty gas station, in the middle of a small dusty town. There were hardly any trees, virtually no green grass &#8230; there were hardly any people. Except for the ones driving in the replica roadsters. We&#8217;d seen a few of them earlier as we were driving, but couldn&#8217;t understand why there seemed to be so many of them. When we saw the sign, it all came much clearer:<br />
<q> Welcome to Seligman. Birthplace of Historic Route 66. </q>So we were on the infamous Route 66. We didn&#8217;t get any kicks &#8230; except in the ass when we saw the price of gas. But when you&#8217;re too low to know whether or not you&#8217;ll get to the next station, you don&#8217;t quibble about it. Instead we tossed in about $10, praying it would get us to our next stop. We spent only enough time in Seligman to buy the gas and record the fact that we&#8217;d been there. We then peeled rubber to get out of there &#8212; it was a little too backwater for our liking.<br />
We arrived in Flagstaff about 19:00 that evening, which was an hour too late to get an oil change. We didn&#8217;t realize this until we had already spent a half hour searching through phone books for lube garages in the area and drove around trying to find them. Already about 150 kilometres over the 5,000 kilometre mark, I was a little apprehensive about driving any further for fear of damaging a new engine. But staying in Flagstaff overnight meant a delay in our schedule, possibly meaning we would have to sacrifice one of our planned destinations. It was four and three quarter hours from Flagstaff to Albuquerque, a distance I wasn&#8217;t too keen on traveling, but in the long run it was better for us to do so.<br />
With some trepidation, we jumped back on I-40 and continued our eastern haul. We drove for about 40 miles before pulling into one of the Arizona rest stops, about 20 miles west of Winslow. Resting in one of the many vast endless terrains in the south-west, the rest stop intruded as little into the area as possible. The only significant structures were the washroom building and the picnic shelters.<br />
Inhabiting one of the picnic sites, we set up our portable barbeque on one of the concrete tables and fired it up to cook the hot dogs. While we were stopped, I also took the liberty of switching the fridge over to the propane supply to try and drop the temperature. The 12 volt system was really only good for keeping the contents at a specific temperature, you needed the 110 volt supply or the propane supply to really get the fridge cold.<br />
Our picnic site had three partial (non-contacting) walls and a flat roof, all made from poured concrete. Behind us was a small rock formation, bearing a sign to watch for scorpions and rattlesnakes. We neither saw or heard any of the dangerous beasties, but the sign wouldn&#8217;t have been there if the danger wasn&#8217;t real. After eating most of the hot dogs (a fortunate idea, preventing them from going bad), Rebecca and Dhar strolled onto the rocks to look into the setting western sun. Their report stated the view would have been much better if some schmuck hadn&#8217;t built his house next to the rest stop.<br />
We flirted with the idea of locking up for the night and sleeping there. But my sense of rules came back into play again, and I flat-out refused to. I hated playing the asshole, but my inability to &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; pretty much prohibited rebellion. A long list of rules posted at the front of every rest stop prohibited camping overnight. A truck pulling an Airstream trailer wasn&#8217;t so picky, they had dropped anchor for the night and didn&#8217;t appear to be moving any time before morning.<br />
The sun had set almost entirely by the time we pulled back onto the I-40. What light that was left cast some of the most beautiful deep red light onto the rock and sand, it looked like we were driving over an open wound in the Earth&#8217;s skin.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
So much for oil changes &#8211; by the time we got to Flagstaff all the lube shops and gas stations had closed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We had dinner at one of the Arizona rest stops tonight. We had to be on the watch for rattlesnakes and scorpions. We didn&#8217;t see any. 280 miles to Albuquerque.</p></div>
<p>It took only a few minutes for us to get bored. Driving across Arizona was in many respects like driving across Kansas &#8212; it was so dull your brain doesn&#8217;t work properly. As such, my memory of crossing Arizona the second time is rather non-existant. Though most likely we gabbed for a good portion of the distance. Either that or Stefan and Rebecca went to sleep, Dhar drove and I rode shotgun. (It was a commonly enough done theme that I tend to forget when it was done.)<br />
At midnight, we were possessed with a serious case of the munchies. Barely inside New Mexico, we pulled into the first major city would could find. Gallup was hardly major by our standards, a population of only 19,200, but when considered the population of New Mexico was only 1.5 million and most of the cities had less than 100,000 residents, Gallup became a fair bit more significant than in other places of the country.<br />
We couldn&#8217;t eat anything that we were carrying with us, the only thing we had left were uncooked potatoes (and although mashed potatoes are always a welcome meal, we didn&#8217;t have any way of cooking them quickly), a little bit of salsa (which despite the fact that I don&#8217;t eat salsa, we had nothing for it to go with), and a couple boxes of President&#8217;s Choice White Cheddar Macaroni and Cheese Dinner (a much fancier version of Kraft Dinner). Suffice to say, none of us were in the cooking mood.<br />
Rebecca wanted KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken), to which Dhar was objecting (with good reason). I wasn&#8217;t that hungry, so I played indifferent to the whole deal. But by the time we found a KFC, we found it had already closed. A McDonald&#8217;s lurked nearby, so we opted to buy something from there instead. The lobby looked closed, so we pulled into the drive-through and sat next to the speaker waiting for someone to take our order.<br />
And we sat. And sat, and sat, and sat. After about ten minutes it was becoming pretty damn clear that no-one was going to take our order. A car in front of us seemed to have already given an order, and was waiting for the order to be filled. Our little lineup hadn&#8217;t gone unnoticed, more cars appeared behind us. But our patience had worn completely thin. Well pulled out of the line and drove out to the road we came in on. When we looked back as we drove off, the lights in the McDonald&#8217;s were turned off. We were none too impressed with the lack of service.<br />
Gallup had few roads that led to interchanges with the I-40. As a result, we ended up having to drive quite a distance before finding the next interchange. But the drive wasn&#8217;t without fortune, as we found a 24 hour restaurant just a hop, skip, and a jump from the Interstate. Hunger now getting the best of us, we pulled in to obtain sustenance.<br />
The restaurant (the name of which escapes me &#8230; c&#8217;mon, it was nothing to celebrate &#8212; if it was, I&#8217;d let you know) was one of a small chain of eateries that ran through the south-west. The general premise was, as usual, &#8220;home-cooking&#8221;. That is the single most over-used and under-achieving terms I have ever heard. This particular restaurant was sparsely populated, and even then the waitress seated us away from everyone else. Somehow, someone was tracking us and warning others of our imminent arrival.<br />
The meals were nothing spectacular, we quickly figured out why the restaurant chain was only in three states. Dhar&#8217;s spicy chicken wasn&#8217;t, my roast beef drowned in the gravy, Rebecca&#8217;s dinner was nearly unspeakable, and Stefan&#8217;s hamburger wasn&#8217;t fit for a dog (or Stefan, for that matter). But hunger is a strange thing &#8212; you&#8217;ll eat nearly anything to calm that rumbling stomach.<br />
About half an hour to 40 minutes later, we boarded the Behemoth, and I took over driving for the rest of the night. The temperature in New Mexico was rather chilly, so we actually ended up using the car heater for a while until we were a bit warmer. Out we pulled and hit the road once again.<br />
The rest of the drive to Albuquerque was uneventful. Somewhere around 02:00, we pulled into New Mexico&#8217;s largest city and started searching for the KOA. Fortunately for us, the KOA Catalogue provided excellent maps for finding the often hard-to-find campgrounds. We pretty much had to drive to the opposite side of the city before getting off the I-40 to get onto Central Avenue.<br />
As was becoming a regular occurrence, Stefan had to do a late check-in. All of us were on the verge of dropping off to sleep (Rebecca had already passed out), and the sooner that we park and slept, the better. Stefan returned in a few minutes and directed us to a slot about 200 metres from the main office, conveniently located next to the washrooms.<br />
Dhar made an immediate run for the toilet, as we hadn&#8217;t stopped for an hour or so and his bladder was on the verge of springing a leak (pun intended). But as we quickly found out, the washrooms were closed for the season. This I found rather odd &#8212; what seasons are there in New Mexico other than summer and not-quite-as-warm-as-summer-but-better-than-winter? Nevertheless, Stefan and Dhar when hunting for the washrooms. Being too tired to care (or urinate, for that matter), I just pulled my bed out, drew most of the blinds, crawled into my sleeping bag and started to nod off.<br />
Stefan and Dhar returned a moment or two later, reporting that the only washroom they could find had a combination lock on it, prevent us from getting in that night. Dhar ended up relieving himself on the right front tire.</p>

		<p>One thing about using an air conditioner &#8212; always use the air exchange feature. The air inside the van was beyond musty that morning. It smelled horrible. I woke blinking towards the navigator&#8217;s side of the van, expecting to see Dhar sleeping. He wasn&#8217;t there. I looked back to the rear bunk. Both Stefan and Rebecca continued to sleep soundly, but our mysterious friend had vanished.<br />
He was outside sitting on the picnic table, waiting for the rest of us to rise. I chatted with him briefly before heading into the shower, and it seemed that Dhar had been getting into trouble. Dhar seemed to be really good at this &#8212; trouble always managed to find him no matter where he went. He also ran into a few of the night people &#8230; y&#8217;know, the kind that should be sent to pasture at the local funny farm? Dhar had not slept that night, and had walked along Boulder Highway for several hours. I was somewhat surprised that he hadn&#8217;t attempted to walk to The Strip.<br />
Next thing I knew, Stefan and Rebecca leapt from the Behemoth, ready to face the day. They had gone to sleep no earlier than 04:00, and had only four and a half or so hours of sleep. Nevertheless, carpe diem was the battle cry and I had to ride the tide of enthusiasm with my freshly-waxed surfboard of enthusiasm. The first order of business, a swim in the pool.<br />
Dhar, as usual, wasn&#8217;t up for a swim that early. (Actually, he was never up for a swim. I began to wonder if he even really took showers &#8212; maybe Dhar dissolved in water.) Rebecca, Stefan, and myself sauntered over to the pool and got ready to take a plunge. But the signs said that the pool wasn&#8217;t open until for another half an hour. This little detail didn&#8217;t block Stefan or Rebecca, they proudly swung the fence gate open and walked into the pool area.<br />
Now I had a small problem with this. When I was in elementary school, I got in trouble all the time. I wasn&#8217;t a bully, I just kept breaking rules all the time. Nothing serious, but the Principal got to know me fairly well after a couple years. Formative years are an important thing to a kid, and in time I learned when to follow the posted signs. I don&#8217;t always, but I did that morning. This compliance with societal (and KOA) rules brought the Wrath of Rebecca upon me again, chiding me to &#8220;colour outside the lines&#8221; and be more out-going. I decided to get wet in a shower instead.<br />
That morning I began to set a plan into motion. One thing Las Vegas had in abundance was hotels &#8230; and there were no two alike. Even before the trip had started, I had decided for myself that we had to spend at least one night in a Vegas hotel. The only problem: too many hotels, only one night. So while I was showering, I tried to think of the best place to stay. And came up blank. The best hotel I had ever stayed in before was the Contemporary Resort Hotel in Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. That was 1980. 16 years later I was now in the adult&#8217;s Disney World, and in need of a hotel of equal splendour.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca returned from the pool not long after I finished bathing, and started for their daily romps through the shower. I proceeded to the AAA TourBook on Nevada and looked through the resort hotels that were around. Caesar&#8217;s Palace, the Luxor, the MGM Grand, the Mirage &#8230; all of them expensive. Enter second stage of my master plan &#8212; I would drive that morning and conspicuously drive into one of them and book a room before anyone knew what hit them. But to insure I wouldn&#8217;t be tied to the bumper and dragged home, I would also foot the bill. Hey, if you&#8217;ve got inheritance, might as well use it! (I think my grandmother would have approved &#8212; she traveled all the time until her eyesight grounded her.)<br />
But first to figure out where to go. I nonchalantly asked Stefan if there was any hotel in Vegas he wanted to stay at, which one would it be. The answer was immediate: Caesar&#8217;s Palace. But almost before I could away, out came the dreaded question I was afraid would come: &#8220;Why [do you ask]?&#8221;<br />
I don&#8217;t like lying outright. I&#8217;ll tell tall tales, I&#8217;ll stretch the truth. But this is the kind of question I don&#8217;t like answering dishonestly. So I leveled with him.<br />
&#8220;Let&#8217;s stay there for a night. It&#8217;s right on The Strip. It&#8217;s an experience we can&#8217;t miss!&#8221;<br />
Stefan was immediately excited about the prospect, but his financial side quickly took over. &#8220;I dunno &#8230; can we afford to?&#8221;<br />
To this I was quick to respond, &#8220;Can we afford not to?&#8221;<br />
(For those of you who don&#8217;t recognize this little two-sided banter, try to remember a VISA commercial where a couple pulls up to the gates of this enormous hotel, stare at it in awe, then the guy asks simply: &#8220;Can we afford to?&#8221; The girl naturally answers: &#8220;Can we afford not to?&#8221; They change their clothes and in they go. I had similar aspirations.)<br />
I had hoped that the conversation would end there, but they persisted on discussing the matter. This is the problem with personal agendas &#8230; no-one else ever knows what the hell you&#8217;re up to at any given moment. The expense of the room was a problem for them, particularly Stefan and Rebecca who were already up to their eyeballs in debts for school. I knew this, but I also knew of a way to correct this problem.<br />
&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221; I said smugly.<br />
&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Rebecca queried. I had a sneaky suspicion she knew what I was up to. Again, this is a question I don&#8217;t like avoiding.<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s on me.&#8221;<br />
Most of my friends would just look at me oddly and accept it. (Although that comes after a great deal of experience dealing with my odd behaviour.) Stefan and Rebecca know that from time to time I&#8217;ll pay for a dinner for my friends. I&#8217;m just that kind of person. I wanted to pay for the hotel room because I knew that neither Stefan or Rebecca could afford it, and I wanted to stay in a room for one night. Dhar, of course, knew nothing of my philanthropic tendencies.<br />
A debate ensued where I was supposed to cave in and let the others help out with the bill. (This is a typical response to such an action.) But if there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from my father (and my grandmother), it&#8217;s stubbornness. I refused to budge. Even if I gave you a level long enough, you&#8217;d still have a tough time moving me. Dhar argued he was more stubborn and eventually would pay me for his share of a room. I looked and couldn&#8217;t help but laugh &#8212; I&#8217;ve heard that claim before, but never has it been substantiated by anyone.<br />
That argument aside, I proceeded to the KOA office to square away more postcards and stamps. I was surprised to find slot machines inside &#8230; I then kicked myself for forgetting what city I was in. In a gaming room just off the office floor, I also found an antique Pac-Man video game machine, circa early 1980&#8217;s. I hadn&#8217;t seen one of those machines in nearly a decade. Alas it wasn&#8217;t running, but its use was well documented by the phosphor burns in the screen. When Stefan came in a few minutes later, I made sure he saw it as well.<br />
We unhooked the van and drove it up to the KOA office so I could deposit my postcards. Dhar took the opportunity to empty the wastewater tanks so we didn&#8217;t have to haul sludge around with us. Then we started on the second order of the day: breakfast.<br />
For all the ridicule that it gets, the International House of Pancakes has got to be one of the few restaurants on my list that I would willingly go to at a moment&#8217;s notice. Especially first thing in the morning (which it was at the time). Fortunately for us, Dhar had found it a few hours earlier during his tour of Boulder Highway.<br />
Las Vegas has one major industry: service. If it weren&#8217;t for service, most of Vegas probably wouldn&#8217;t exist. As such, every place you go has people so nice, you&#8217;d think you were back home in Canada. Our hostess was a grandmother (or so she claimed), and seemed to only have the job to keep her busy. But she was one of those kinds of people who loved what she did. (And if she hated her job, she did an awfully good job of hiding it.)<br />
Huge breakfasts were the order &#8212; the table was full of plates, bowls, glasses, decanters, and jugs. Every last scrap of edible material was consumed by someone (usually Stefan), with our lovely hostess continually trying to get me to order a hot fudge sundae to finish it all off. Okay, I&#8217;m a chocoholic, I love sugary things, but even I have my limits to what I&#8217;ll eat for breakfast. (Stop laughing &#8230; I&#8217;m serious here! Really!)<br />
Paying for breakfast, we piled back into the Behemoth and tried to figure out how to get downtown. A quick perusal of the map indicated that Flamingo Road or Tropicana Avenue would provide an adequate route to Las Vegas Boulevard, more commonly known as &#8220;The Strip&#8221;. My carefully thought out plan wasn&#8217;t quite working &#8230; Stefan ended up driving. (My plans very seldom go as planned.)<br />
Vegas is an interesting place &#8212; the casinos seem to be confined to certain areas, all within a block of The Strip. (Mind you, those are big city blocks.) When we reached the corner of Flamingo Road and The Strip, we were surrounded by Bally&#8217;s on our left, the Barbary Coast Hotel on our right side, and Caesar&#8217;s Palace across the road from Barbary Coast. Stefan had seen all this before, but the collective jaws of Dhar, Rebecca and myself dropped at the sight. It was broad daylight so none of the lights were on, but we could easily see what was in store for us that evening. We couldn&#8217;t wait for the sun to set.<br />
We turned north on The Strip and quickly entered the left lane to turn into Caesar&#8217;s driveway. The hotel was the largest I had ever seen to that point. It sprawled about, almost a mile long when you included the mall tacked on to the north end of the casino. The grounds were a deep green (from the seemingly hourly watering) with impressive statues and small buildings. A huge textured dome revealed the presence of the Omnimax theatre that had been installed a few years previous. We had a desire to see whatever movie was playing, provided it wasn&#8217;t Wings of Courage. Val Kilmer is a great actor, but it was such a waste of movie for the technology.<br />
Following the signs, we turned left into an area meant for taxis and valet parking &#8230; neither of which fit our bill. But I was more intent on getting the room squared away as quickly as possible. I hopped out with Rebecca in tow while Stefan and Dhar attempted to make their way through the jam of cars to a safe place to wait for our return. And so I entered one of the most legendary hotel casinos in the world &#8230;<br />
Just inside the main door was a rotating four-sided sign advertising several of the hotel&#8217;s features among them the Omnimax movie &#8230; Wings of Courage. (So much for the movie.) When I turned to face into the hotel, I again felt culture shock. If Boulder Station had been impressive, the floor of Caesar&#8217;s Palace was beyond description. (And the sound was so deafening, that sexually-repressed prude would&#8217;ve had a heart attack and died.)<br />
It took us a moment to figure out where to go, but we quickly found the check-in desk, conveniently tucked away on one side. I jumped in line, about the 30th person, and waited patiently to check-in. Rebecca started back to the van to tell Dhar and Stefan we would be a while. Then I saw the sign that read: &#8220;Check-out 12:00&#8221;. It was noon. Check-in was at 15:00. I quickly grabbed Rebecca before she got too far.<br />
The next logical step: use a telephone. The phones weren&#8217;t too far away, and I couldn&#8217;t help but think of the circularity of having to call the hotel from a hotel phone to book a room at that hotel. The phones were standard pay-phones, but the handsets all had Caesar&#8217;s Palace logos engraved into them. A rather elegant, albeit tacky, touch.<br />
The Reservations desk couldn&#8217;t help &#8212; all the rooms were booked. Unfortunately, I saw this coming. The next step was to find an alternative. I started flipping through the book looking for something that would be just as fun. I ruled Luxor out because it was at the end of The Strip, and I really didn&#8217;t feel like walking all that distance. The Mirage and the MGM Grand looked interesting, but then Treasure Island popped out before my eyes. Rebecca had no qualms with the choice, so I dropped another coin and started dialing.<br />
If I thought calling Caesar&#8217;s Palace from one of their own phones was circular, the idea of calling one of their competition was absolutely ironic. But fortunate &#8230; Treasure Island wasn&#8217;t booked, despite a convention they were apparently hosting. I immediately made a reservation for a nice room that the four of us could share.<br />
This booking took a bit of thought. Originally Dhar and I had considered getting a room on our own so we could leave Rebecca and Stefan alone for an evening. But I knew I couldn&#8217;t afford two good rooms (there wasn&#8217;t such a thing as a mediocre room in these places), so I opted for something large enough that we wouldn&#8217;t feel crowded.<br />
Then I remembered Rebecca&#8217;s desire for a hot tub. I asked whether any of the rooms had such facilities. A suite called a &#8220;Pirate&#8217;s Cove&#8221; had Jacuzzis, which was close enough to our needs. The cost was substantially higher, but I felt that the price would be worth the experience. I read out my VISA information to the clerk to reserve the room (with little fear of being overheard &#8212; the phones were quite near the casino floor), and asked when we could take occupancy. It seemed that all hotels had a 15:00 check-in.<br />
Stefan had managed to find a place to pull in just down from the taxi and valet spaces. After a quick report of the driving skills of the valets, we started back towards The Strip. We wanted to see what it was all about, and since we had about three hours to kill, driving for a while seemed like a good idea.<br />
We passed by the Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Mirage, Harrah&#8217;s, Treasure Island, Sands (the last of the Vegas greats, which closed its doors only two months later), Desert Inn, Frontier, Riviera, and Circus Circus before The Strip more or less ended. Just a ways from the Frontier stood one of the newest additions to The Strip, the Stratosphere. Billed as the tallest free-standing tower in America, it looked suspiciously like the Seattle&#8217;s Space Needle. The last time Stefan had been in Las Vegas he had seen the construction sign for it, and he thought it the sign had said tallest in the world.<br />
Parts of the structure and its accompanying hotel and casino were still under construction when we stayed in Vegas, but it was very close to completion. So much so we wondered whether or not the hotel was open for business or not. As we passed by, Dhar noticed an odd red ring that seemed to circle the top of the observation level of the tower. Almost at once we realized what it was&#8230;<br />
Some idiot put a roller coaster at the top of Las Vegas. On the outside of the tower. It ran along the edge of the observation level in a nice circle, perhaps twice (at its height we couldn&#8217;t get a clear view). The idea was simultaneously unthinkable and exciting. I immediately wanted to know if it was ready for use. Although we never officially found out for certain, not once did we see a coaster train in operation. I had to wonder how many guarantees the local Government was given to allow such a thing to be built.<br />
(And on that note, I found out about a year later that the roller coaster is only half the fun up there. In addition to swinging out over Vegas streets 1000 feet below, there is also another ride which catapults you up another 200 feet or so into the air. I don&#8217;t know what raving lunatic came up with those ideas, but the mere thought of dangling 1,200 feet above the ground doesn&#8217;t exactly appeal to me.)<br />
Once the interesting part of Las Vegas Boulevard had ended, we entered into the seedier part of area, with motels bearing signs such as: &#8220;Elvis Slept Here&#8221; and &#8220;Recommended By Owner&#8221; (if those aren&#8217;t the best reviews you&#8217;ve ever heard &#8230; go somewhere else). One of the few establishments that was of any interest was the Graceland Chapel, one of the marriage institutions that will marry you to your loved one for a mere $25. An added bonus at the Graceland Chapel was to receive the service from an Elvis impersonator. But State law said that you had to be married first, and could only renew vows with said impersonator. Alas, no fun for poor little Geoff.<br />
We continued along Las Vegas Boulevard until we reached the Fremont Street area. Fremont is where one can find &#8220;Las Vegas Classic&#8221; &#8212; what&#8217;s left of the original casinos. A couple years ago the city council (mostly likely under some pressure from casinos and businesses on Fremont Street) turned a few blocks of Fremont Street into a pedestrian mall. To make the area more interesting, the road was also covered with a roof. But this was no ordinary roof.<br />
I had first heard about it on CNN, probably on the Science and Technology Week program. The roof extended over a two to three block distance. This in itself was nothing unusual, I&#8217;d heard of such structures in other places. But this is Las Vegas, not some boring metropolis. The underside of the roof was covered with six million coloured lights, in effect creating a gigantic video wall. Every hour the roof comes alive with a light show the likes of which I had never seen &#8230; and unfortunately still haven&#8217;t. From the Behemoth, I got my only good look at it. I had hoped to see it later that evening, in operation, but we never traveled further north than Treasure Island.<br />
We rounded the next corner and turned onto Main Street to head south. (In this area of Vegas there seemed to be several one-way roads.) Las Vegas Boulevard just a bit past Circus Circus became one-way northbound at the intersection of Main Street, Las Vegas Boulevard, and Paradise Road (Main Street became Paradise Road).<br />
On the way back, we decided to kill more time by finding out what Caesar&#8217;s Palace was like. Since we weren&#8217;t staying there, a browse through the establishment seemed like a good idea. We arrived at Caesar&#8217;s a few minutes later and entered the same driveway we entered about a half hour earlier. But this time we turned right at the fork in the road and went around the Omnimax dome towards the rear parking lot. Stefan grumbled about not being able to see a good Omnimax movie, I looked in surprise at the valet parking for the eager shoppers of the Forum Shops. (I mean, when is it too much? Valet parking to use the bathroom?)<br />
For such a large and popular enterprise, Caesar&#8217;s Palace had an awfully small parking lot. But fortunately not everyone drives, so we managed to find a parking spot without too much effort. We had to crack the roof vent, turn the fan on, and draw all the curtains to keep the van from getting too warm. Outside the temperature was probably in excess of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), but to be totally honest, we really didn&#8217;t notice.<br />
In southern Ontario we border on Lake Ontario. Its 19,011 square kilometres have this unusual effect of keeping temperatures within about two to three kilometres of the lake relatively smooth &#8212; no hideous spikes or dips. Unfortunately, its 19,011 square kilometres also provide a great deal of humidity. The &#8220;dog-days&#8221; of summer have particular meaning there, especially the days when the humidity hits 100% without the hope of rain. Even a normally comfortable 26 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) becomes unbearable.<br />
Nevada has the distinction of being the driest state in the Union. The humidity that day couldn&#8217;t have even come close to approaching double digits. It was nearly impossible to dampen a shirt from perspiration &#8212; it would evaporate almost immediately. In a way, that kind of climate is good to have from time to time, it&#8217;s a cleansing kind of climate, in a dry-cleaning sort of way.<br />
We entered the Forum Shops through the lower level, at the valet parking entrance. (The Forum had no rear access for some unknown reason.) The escalator deposited us at one end of the mall, looking into the casino. On our left was the Warner Brothers store, which we left for last. It was time to see how the rich shopped, and realize just how poor we were.<br />
The general premise behind Forum Shops at Caesar&#8217;s Palace seemed to get back all the money the gambler won at the casino. There was no such thing as a cheap or inexpensive item in the whole place. It was like an upscale Neiman-Marcus, a hip Sharper Image, a trendy Rodeo Drive (with a ceiling). And of course the whole motif was Classical Roman. After all, Caesar wouldn&#8217;t approve if it looked like any other mall.<br />
The design of the mall was reasonable simple &#8212; a single hallway that bent in two places. At each of the bends there were large fountains. The ceiling covering the hallway was painted to resemble the sky, and included variable lights that changed colour to show the changing hours of the day. The first fountain was immense, containing several sculptures of Roman gods and a Pegasus with wings spread.<br />
The second fountain was a little more interesting though. We arrived at the end of an hourly laser light show at the fountain. Everyone seemed enthralled with the presentation, but we saw too little of the show to really know what it was about. We made indefinite plans to see it an hour later, at 14:00. More on that later&#8230;<br />
Almost as soon as the crowd started dispersing from the show we narrowly missed, Dhar ducked into a sunglass store to purchase a hard case for his glasses. I contemplated buying a new pair of glasses to complement the ones I regularly wore (which were really ugly), but after a quick view of the selection, I decided against it. In hindsight, I wish I had bought new glasses since I could&#8217;ve used opinions from Rebecca, Dhar, and Stefan to help me make up my mind. Being fashionably challenged, I have always had a great deal of trouble in picking something that looked good on me. What I though looked good other would think was horrible.<br />
Another store that caught our fancy was a magic store, on the other side of the second fountain chamber on the same side as the sunglass store. I have always been interested in magic tricks, but mostly in figuring out how they&#8217;re done. The salesmen were truly gifted in their craft, perhaps retired magicians themselves &#8212; they demonstrated their wares with such skill and finesse that I was left completely stumped. Even something as simple as making a small ball magically pass through solid copper cups (a sleight-of-hand trick) had me dying to know how it was done. As much as I wanted to buy some of the tricks to learn them for myself, I decided that I&#8217;d just wait until I found someone who could teach me. Rebecca was tempted to get a trick for Eric to learn. I was tempted to tell her to learn how to make Eric disappear. (Not that I dislike the kid &#8212; Eric was the first kid I actually liked, probably because he reminds me of when I was a little kid.)<br />
Disney had a fair stake in their store, right up to the Roman style sculpture of Mickey Mouse over the store entrance. The floor of the entrance was also noteworthy &#8212; several hundred tiny lights were embedded in the plastic, wood, and concrete walkway, that glowed in patterns that cycled about every five minutes or so. The merchandise inside was nothing particularly special, I could find it at just about any franchise store. The main exception were the shirts made exclusively for the store in Forum Shops, bearing the names and logos of the Forum Shops and Caesar&#8217;s Palace.<br />
We popped in and out of stores on our way down the hall until we reached the end of the line: a set of stairs going down. These led into the &#8220;kids&#8221; area of the mall, consisting of a virtual reality theatre and a video arcade. We forwent with the virtual reality and concentrated on the video games. Like any well-managed arcade, all the recent and popular games were near the doorway, the rest were placed towards the rear in decreasing order of income.<br />
That was the first time I heard of (or took notice of) Namco, a seemingly major player in the billion dollar video game industry. Namco&#8217;s flagship game, at least at this arcade, was a first-person light gun shoot-&#8217;em-up. Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t remember the name. (I found the game some months later, it&#8217;s called Time Crisis.) The graphics and the movement of the characters and the screen images was nothing short of awesome. Someone had taken a great deal of time to make the polygon rendering subsystem blindingly quick and smooth. I wanted to peel the cover off to see if there was a Silicon Graphics workstation embedded in the immense box.<br />
We stopped in a hologram store that had some laser art I had never seen before. (The general premise behind holograms is fairly elementary (at least when you compare it to quantum mechanics), a pure light source (i.e. a laser beam) is split and the two separate beams bounced of an object. The interference patterns of the two bounced beams (that is, the intersecting wave patterns) then hit a photographic plate where the interference patterns encode a three dimensional image.)<br />
But most holograms are static &#8212; that is to say when you move from side to side, or up an down, the object in the image appears stationary. Several of the holograms we saw used a totally new technique that allowed a mini-movie to be made: dancing ballerinas, moving animals, even a stripper (this was, after all, Las Vegas). I could tell that I was not alone in trying to understand how to make something like that, but I was getting about as far as Stefan and Dhar in deciphering the mystery.<br />
When we returned to the second fountain, almost an hour had passed. Still having about ten or so minutes before the next show, we ducked into a sports store in search of sandals. Dhar always wore his jeans (for some strange reason &#8212; even in New Orleans, where it was hot and humid, he couldn&#8217;t be convinced that shorts might be more apropos), but wanted his feet to be cool (his sneakers were obviously warm). At least he did recognize that sandals were more comfortable than shoes in the heat, and he wanted to buy a pair as soon as possible.<br />
The selection in the store was slim, and the prices fat. Stefan remarked that he could buy the same shoes in Canada for exactly the same price &#8212; not taking currency conversion into account. The Forum Shops were definitely not meant for the price-conscientious. In other words, Students need not apply.<br />
The dry air, combined with a fairly physical trip through the mall combined to make the lot of us very thirsty. Luckily for us there was a restaurant and deli right next to where we were standing. But getting into either meant a 15-20 minute wait. Thirst does not wait. We found a &#8220;drink bar&#8221; that extended from the deli. It was like every other store in the Forum Shops &#8212; expensive. A soft drink (i.e. Coca Cola) cost over $3.00, and had too much ice for my liking. But it was a fluid, and dehydration wasn&#8217;t big on my list of things to experience that day.<br />
No sooner than we purchased our drinks that the show began. (I said I&#8217;d get back to this.) Allow me to set the stage: the fountain sat in the middle of a large rotunda about 150 feet across and about 50 feet high. About 35-40 feet up the walls were all the effects devices: lasers, mirrors, projectors, smoke machines and so forth. On the opposite side of the rotunda was a small window for the show operator. In the fountain itself was the focal point of the show: the statutes.<br />
Statues you say? How can statues be a show? Riddle me this, fair reader: When is a statue not a statue? When it&#8217;s an expensive piece of animatronics. (Remember folks, we&#8217;re still in Las Vegas.) The centrepiece of the fountain was a set of four statues: a ring of three standing figures, two male and one female; a fourth and much larger (not only in size, but in girth) male figure sat in a large chair in the very centre, but raised above the other three statues. The outer three statues were to represent Venus, Mars and Mercury (unless I&#8217;ve gotten my gods confused). The centre statue was either Bacchus, the Roman god of wine and revelry (and the patron saint of university students) or a rather fat Julius Caesar. I was never too sure which.<br />
At first glance the statues looked like ordinary marble. Until they started moving, that is. And I don&#8217;t mean just twirling around like a music box dancer &#8212; I mean moving. The centre statue would yawn and stretch, the feet would shift slightly, even the body would adjust its position in the chair. And of course, it would speak, jowls a-flapping. The mere production of the show lost all meaning for myself, and probably Stefan and Dhar as well &#8212; we were too keen on knowing how the contraption worked.<br />
This was not just some thrown together rubber, pneumatic, electronic piece of showmanship one would expect for Las Vegas. This was worthy of top-notch Hollywood effects. The movements were fluid and precise, appearing to be completely organic. (Take a look at how an assembly line robotic arm moves and compare that to how a human arm moves &#8212; they are very different motions.) Even the lip-syncing was well done &#8230; at least when I could hear the voices. (For all the money Caesar&#8217;s Palace pumped into the display, they could&#8217;ve at least put in a more effective sound system.)<br />
Although I didn&#8217;t catch all the words (I was more enthralled with the technical aspect of the show), the gist of it was essentially a grabber to get you to go into the casino. Okay, they didn&#8217;t directly mention the casino, but why else would you go to Caesar&#8217;s Palace in the first place? Yes, they could&#8217;ve put the gist of the show on a billboard, but then it just wouldn&#8217;t be as flashy. Las Vegas is a service-oriented city, and advertisement is the key to delivering that service.<br />
When the show ended, I took the opportunity to disappear for a few minutes into a memorabilia shop containing some of the most unusual things I had ever seen. Aside from the typical autographed movie posters and record albums, there were also hats, toy cars, antique gas pumps, an original plastic Ronald McDonald to place on park benches &#8230; so much stuff there was hardly any room to walk. I left after a short stay &#8212; I began to feel like the proverbial bull in a china shop.<br />
But nothing was as impressive as the gadget store. It almost resembled the commercial end of the fictional Q Branch of James Bond fame. I almost expected to see a grey Astin-Martin DB5 parked in the corner complete with the ejection seat. Actually, it would more likely have been the BMW from Goldeneye &#8212; the Astin-Martin would&#8217;ve been more appropriate in the memorabilia shop &#8230; if there was room to store it.<br />
Tools, clocks, digital barbeques, pool accessories, maps, lights, radios &#8230; you name it, they probably had it. One of the neatest pieces I saw was, of all things, a keychain. It was an ingenious device: a disc about an inch diametre and about a quarter inch thick. Around the side of the disc was a groove in which a half dozen individual rings could spin around the disc. A small button in the centre of the disc released a little catch opening a gap in the groove, allowing the rings to be removed. I can&#8217;t tell you how close I came to buying it, the number of times I&#8217;ve needed to remove a key from my keychain is unthinkable. However, the price they wanted for the simple device was equally unthinkable &#8230; $30.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan found their perfect product there too &#8230; a massage chair. Remember that episode of The Simpsons where Homer finds the ultimate in relaxation chairs, one that vibrates so much he begins to feel like Dave Bowman as he entered the monolith in 2001? Well, this one didn&#8217;t vibrate, but it had a very similar effect on Rebecca &#8212; she was flushed from only five minutes of use.<br />
We spent a disproportionate amount of time perusing the store, and after at least a half hour of window shopping, we mustered up enough will power to drag ourselves from the store (most of the energy was used in convincing Rebecca to get out of the chair). That chair cost $4,000. I was informed several times that if Stefan and Rebecca won enough money, we would be bringing it back with us. I wondered if we could con the border guards by getting them to sit in the chair and massage them into submission.<br />
The next stop was at Victoria&#8217;s Secret. The mail order catalogue of men&#8217;s fantasies had a retail store in the Forum Shops. Dhar and I elected to stay outside while Stefan and Rebecca went it. It&#8217;s not that I get embarrassed, it&#8217;s just that I didn&#8217;t even want to think about watching anyone trying on lingerie unless I knew that person really well and I was dating (or married to) said person. Going in there would have been like making a chocolate mousse cake, and then not eating any.<br />
Have I mentioned yet that Dhar was shutter-happy? I didn&#8217;t think so. (How&#8217;d I forget that?) He never stopped taking pictures. I think the only time he did was when he was changing rolls of film. Although I will admit that I did come close to using as many rolls of film as Dhar, I didn&#8217;t take as many people pictures as he did. Dhar would take pictures whenever he felt most like being a pain in the ass. I will admit that it bugged me, but in retrospect I relate to his habit. On previous excursions I had been known to be even worse, and I earned a reputation for being a total asshole for some of the pictures I took.<br />
Our last stop in the mall was in the Warner Brothers store. This was my doing. My friend Scott had several years before gone to a Warner Brothers store in Buffalo, New York and returned with an Animaniacs baseball cap. I will immediately admit I was jealous, the both of us were fans of the cartoon and of Amblin Entertainment, those responsible for the animated mayhem. I was hoping to find something in the store that interested me enough to get possible revenge (in a non-spiteful manner). Alas, the store simply wasn&#8217;t stocked with particularly unique items and those that did interest me carried a rather high sticker shock.<br />
By this time it was about 15:00 and we decided it was time to head over to Treasure Island and deposit most of our junk in a hotel room so we could explore more of The Strip. Down the escalator and out the valet entrance and back to the parking lot we went. On the way Dhar tried to use up the rest of his film by taking a picture of Rebecca in a &#8220;provocative and sexy&#8221; pose. For a woman who knows a great deal (and possibly too much) about sex, she can&#8217;t pose worth a damn. One reason why Rebecca isn&#8217;t a model&#8230;<br />
The drawn curtains and the ceiling fan did their jobs, the van was not uncomfortably warm. Stefan drove us back out under the Forum Shops, by the valet entrance and out to Las Vegas Boulevard, where we had entered over two hours earlier. We traveled north on Las Vegas Boulevard for approximately a kilometre and turned left onto Buccaneer Boulevard, which was actually Treasure Island&#8217;s driveway. Stefan pulled into the taxi and valet drop off area, Rebecca and I hopped out and went in to register.<br />
Again the sudden shift from medium noise to tremendous clamor was unsettling. But Treasure Island didn&#8217;t seem to be as loud as Caesar&#8217;s Palace &#8230; different slots perhaps, or I was getting used to the sound (stage two of Lasvegasitis was likely setting in). We found the registration desk and presented myself to a gentleman by the name of Leland, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. (The only reason I remembered the name was because it&#8217;s a rare one, I&#8217;ve only ever heard it once before &#8212; in the movie Toys.)<br />
I gave him my credit card, he double checked that I knew the hotel room was costing some $350.00 (American funds, but including taxes). Although I didn&#8217;t see Rebecca&#8217;s face when Leland read of the price, I swear I heard her gasp quietly. I cursed to myself, I had hoped no-one would find out how much one of these rooms cost per night. I signed a few forms, then Leland asked me for the names of the others. I assumed this was in case one of us lost our key, we could report to the registration desk and get a new one.<br />
The keys were of the newer swipe cards, much like a bank machine card or a credit card. The card is inserted into the lock, pulled out and providing you 1) haven&#8217;t somehow buggered up the magnetic strip, or 2) accidentally gone to the wrong room, the lock clicked open and you walked in. Leland let us know that the room was still being cleaned but that we could go up and drop our stuff off.<br />
Stefan and Dhar were waiting up the curb from the taxi stop. We climbed in and continued down the road to find the parking lots. Immediately we were confronted with a small problem: the Behemoth wouldn&#8217;t fit into the standard parking garages. One of the garages had a clearance of eight feet, four inches &#8212; one inch higher than us &#8212; but the lack of safe distance convinced us to find the oversized lot. This was so far back we could almost have as easily walked from the Forum Shops.<br />
We grabbed our bags, clothes, cameras, and some of the valuables (one can never be too careful about security), cracked the ceiling vent and turned on the fan, opened a couple windows (barely large enough to put a child&#8217;s arm through) and headed back to the main entrance. The intense heat of southern Nevada finally hit us, but only because we were carrying heavy loads.<br />
I honestly wish I could&#8217;ve seen some of the reactions of the casino patrons as we tramped into the hotel. Like most of the resorts, the casino was the centrepiece. To get to the hotel elevators you had to go through the casino floor; to get to the restaurants you had to go through the casino floor; to get to the shows or any of the stores you had to go through the casino floor. Although a large number of the people on the floor were tourists, and not dressed particularly nicely, we were outfitted with t-shirts, cut-off jeans, baseball caps, and large hiking backpacks. (And even if no-one noticed there, we definitely attracted attention when we checked into our hotel in New Orleans.)<br />
Fortunately, the casino wasn&#8217;t a terribly large one, and the slot machines took up the vast majority of the available space. Only about two hundred square metres was devoted to the other games (blackjack, craps, roulette, et cetera) &#8230; out of the approximately 30,000 square metres of casino floor space. For what it lacked in size it made up in business &#8212; it seemed to keep a regular flow of people in and out.<br />
Two sets of elevators ferried guests to their rooms. One set took you no higher than the 14th floor. The other set was for floors above 14. It took us a moment to realize this, even though we caught the right set of elevators on the first try.<br />
When we reached the 16th floor, we looked around for a sign that might indicate our room. Treasure Island was built in a &#8216;Y&#8217; shape, the &#8216;V&#8217; portion of the &#8216;Y&#8217; shape faced Las Vegas Boulevard, the tail stuck out back. A small dark brown sign with white lettering indicated four directions to travel in: right, centre, left and Suite 1620. It&#8217;s amazing how important you suddenly feel when it&#8217;s necessary to list your room separately from the rest of the lesser rooms.<br />
The double doors were open, a cleaning cart indicated that the room was still being cleaned. I had hoped that when I had made the reservation the staff might move a tad quicker and make arrangements to have the room ready when we arrived. We knocked once and cautiously entered the room. I had to bite my tongue when I heard the Hispanic maid emerge from one of the bathrooms speaking broken English. I had always assumed that kind of character was strictly stereotypical for Hollywood, I never expected to actually see something like that.<br />
The maid asked me for my door key, which she indicated I should check in the door. The door lock is a simple device: a small brass box about 10 centimetres wide, 20 centimetres long and sticking about two to three centimetres out of the door. At the bottom of the box was a thin black slot into which the card is inserted. Above the slot is a red light and a green light. Assuming the card is valid, the green light winks on a second or two after inserting and removing the card from the slot.<br />
I have been in many hotel rooms in my life, varying from comfortable to roach infested. But never had I ever come close to having a hotel room like this. The double doors led to a short hallway about 10 metres in length and four metres wide. About two thirds of the way down the hallway were two sets of double doors, one on each side, both leading to washrooms. The hallway opened into a large room, about eight metres in width and 15 metres long. Across from the hallway was a window sans openings. I was disappointed that there was no balcony, but as Stefan pointed out that oversight probably saved a lot of would-be jumpers.<br />
The &#8220;His&#8221; washroom (on the left, looking into the suite from the main doors) was very spacious: roughly 25-30 metres square. At the back left corner was a toilet (and just in front of the toilet was a phone), and the back right corner sported a shower. In the centre was a very wide-countered sink and mirror. A closet could be found just left of the washroom door, complete with safe (to which we didn&#8217;t have the combination). The floors were tiled, as were the walls in the shower.<br />
The &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom (on the right, looking into the suite from the main doors) was a mirror image of the &#8220;His&#8221; washroom with two notable exceptions. First, the toilet was in the front left corner of the washroom. Secondly, there was a whirlpool bathtub in the back left corner. It was not hot tub, but it would fill our needs &#8230; rather, Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s needs.<br />
The main room was sparsely furnished. On the left side of the room (looking into the suite from the main doors) was a king size bed, two night tables with lamps, and a large chest at the foot of the bed. On the right side of the room was a chesterfield, a chair, a low coffee table, a cabinet and a TV. All the furniture was white in colour finished with gold-coloured trim. (The woodwork had gold paint; the chairs, chesterfield, and bed had thin gold-coloured rope with tassels.)<br />
We marveled at the room for a few minutes, then decided to figure out what it was we were going to do. One of the first things on the agenda were showers and baths, since we wanted to go out to dinner before engaging in anything else. But first, we watched a little TV (much to my chagrin &#8212; I had hoped to avoid TV for the entire trip). We found the second TV in the chest at the foot of the bed, pressing a button similar to a garage door opener caused the TV to rise majestically from the inside.<br />
We quickly found out where our gas woes had come from &#8212; gas prices across the United States had jumped between five and 10 cents a gallon in the past few days. Some places hadn&#8217;t been drastically affected, but parts of California were asking $2.20 a gallon. We were suddenly relieved that California had been cut from the travel plan some weeks earlier.<br />
A couple channels were dedicated to broadcasting Las Vegas-related programming. One channel in particular was from Treasure Island itself, and continually played a movie about a kid&#8217;s adventure at the resort. Gambling was restricted to those 18 years of age or older, so the movie had likely been produced to get the kids excited about other things to do. From a critical point of view, it was entirely commercial but with enough Hollywood flair to make it passable for its intended audiences, namely kids.<br />
Rebecca turned to the whirlpool a little while later. It was then she made a rather odd request of me. I was asked to take a picture of her, but only after she deemed it okay for me to go in. I continued to vegetate in front of the TV over by the chesterfield until I heard her melodious voice call from the &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom. I was joined by Stefan at this call.<br />
There was Rebecca, seated in the middle of a sea of foam, the rose tattoo on her left shoulder standing out on her milky-white skin, and a huge grin crossing her face. I guessed that Rebecca had never been in such a place before and wanted to show off the things she got to do during the trip. I pulled out the camera, made a couple of adjustments to the focus and exposure settings, and promptly screwed up the first picture by forgetting to turn the flash on. The second picture ended up much more flattering, but gained a strange bluish tint to which I have yet to find a cause. No sooner than I had returned to the chair I had been sitting in to put the camera back in its bag than Stefan disappeared into the &#8220;Hers&#8221; washroom, locking the door behind him.<br />
Rebecca and Stefan didn&#8217;t spend too long alone, emerging only about 20 minutes later. Dhar disappeared into the &#8220;His&#8221; bathroom for his shower. The remaining three of us began to discuss the events of the evening. Dhar had decided not to see one of the famous Vegas shows that night, he was more intent on seeing The Strip. On a suggestion from Rebecca, the Cirque du Soleil show, Mystére, became our primary focus on the itinerary.<br />
When Rebecca began to make preparations for the tickets, I promptly announced I was taking my shower (Dhar having completed his), and marched into the &#8220;His&#8221; bathroom. I was ecstatic to find that the Mirage (builder, owner, and operator of Treasure Island) hadn&#8217;t skimped on much of anything, putting in some of the best showers I had ever used. The free toiletries were no hell, but they seldom are.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960425.175</strong><br />
<em>Day 5</em><br />
Vegas along &#8216;The Strip&#8217; is nothing short of breath-taking. [Mostly due to the automobile exhaust.] I knew that this was going to be a great experience, so I took the liberty of getting us a room downtown at Treasure Island. Expensive, but it&#8217;s the experience that counts.<br />
Caesar&#8217;s Palace is an adult&#8217;s playground, and I suspect that the rest of The Strip isn&#8217;t much different.<br />
It&#8217;s going to be a long night&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea was to have brought &#8220;good&#8221; clothes with us so that we could all go out to a good restaurant and eat a good meal. However, my interpretation of Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s idea of &#8220;good&#8221; clothes wasn&#8217;t quite correct. Taking an assumption that experienced campers would bring clothes that would be acceptable in most places as &#8220;nice&#8221;, I brought along clothes I could pack away that wouldn&#8217;t be damaged by creasing. Unfortunately, what they brought I considered to be in the &#8220;business casual&#8221; category. I suddenly felt very underdressed.<br />
Dhar was the most dapper of the three men, but he wasn&#8217;t going to join us for dinner. For some reason, he was more inclined to eat on his own and explore the city that is Las Vegas. Our reservations for Cirque du Soleil were for 19:30, with recommendations to arrive at 19:00 to make sure we could get in. This meant we had to go for dinner at 18:00 so we could get in on time. Dhar left for his evening romp just before we went downstairs.<br />
Of the half-dozen or so restaurants in Treasure Island, my attire excluded us from the two upscale establishments. We ended up at the third fanciest restaurant, just up the hall from the Cirque du Soleil&#8217;s theatre and across the hall from the shops. On arrival we found a fairly long line to wait through. It took about 15 minutes before we were seated at a table.<br />
The interior of the restaurant was made to look like an outdoors Caribbean plaza: the walls were made to look like plaster-covered brick, complete with cracks and missing pieces. Fake windows and the odd closed balcony added to the illusion. The tables and chairs were made from wrought iron, an interesting choice for furniture, but again fitting to the atmosphere.<br />
The menu was nothing elaborate, offering meals from a variety of tastes including Italian, seafood, Cajun, Mexican, and traditional American. All three of us decided upon pasta dishes: I had a hot Italian sausage penne, Stefan originally was going to have the same but switched to something else, and Rebecca had a seafood linguine &#8230; shrimp, I believe. We also had a nice red wine to go along with the meal.<br />
By the time we finished it was almost 19:00, and I was a slightly inebriated. I had drank a little more wine than Rebecca, and certainly much faster. Not to mention my alcoholic tolerance was significantly lower. Fortunately my meal allowed me to metabolize the wine fairly swiftly and within about a half hour I was sober.<br />
The tickets to the show were over $60 apiece. I was a little taken aback at the price, but our seats were third row centre. I remarked on Rebecca&#8217;s ability to get such good seats on such short notice. The tickets were expensive, but as I would soon find out, well worth the price. I wanted to pay Rebecca back for the cost of the ticket (she had purchased the tickets on her VISA card while I had been in the shower), but I was countered with a negative response &#8212; I pay for the room, they paid for the tickets. The wine, not yet worn off, prevented me from arguing the point any further.<br />
Based in Montreal, the Cirque du Soleil ( &#8220;Circus of the Sun&#8221;) company runs several troupes that tour the globe at any given time. The troupe at Treasure Island however, was as permanent as their facility. I had seen a Cirque du Soleil performance in Quebec City in 1986, and a spin-off company of former Cirque du Soleil members a couple years later &#8212; both were in large circus-style tents. Even a quick glance around the room told you that Cirque du Soleil had the facility built to their specifications.<br />
The seating was arranged in a nearly perfect semi-circle, divided into a lower section and an upper section. The lower section had about 15 rows of seats, the upper section about 20 to 30. All were cushioned folding seats with drink holders in the armrests. This was a far cry from the scaffolding benches I had sat on in performances of years past.<br />
The stage was an impressive sight. It was arranged in a kind of thrust stage arrangement more at home in proper stage drama theatres. The &#8220;thrust&#8221; portion of the stage started at the curve in the semi-circle of seats and extended back towards the main portion of the stage. The thrust portion was about 10 metres wide and 15 metres deep. The main portion of the state ran back a further 15 to 20 metres and was at least 50 to 60 metres wide (including the invisible wings). On either side of the stage were towers that ran from the walls to about a quarter of the distance into the stage area. A third of the way up the towers were places for the musicians.<br />
I thought it a bit strange to have live music at a performance such as this. The Cirque du Soleil wasn&#8217;t a true circus in the sense there were no animals &#8212; at least if you considered all the performers human. The performance was completely scripted and timed &#8212; specific events happened at specific times, and humans could be relied upon to stick to those cues. A simple pre-recorded sound track should suffice. As I would later learn, there was a reason for live music.<br />
A commotion and low murmuring behind us caused us to turn around &#8230; curiousity is a hard thing to ignore. A well-endowed woman in a white skin-tight dress (ending about six inches down her thighs) had entered the room. I immediately wondered how much she had paid to get her bosom to look the way it did. Then I noticed the reason for the murmuring: it wasn&#8217;t the woman, it was the clown following her, ogling her every move.<br />
I had forgotten about the clowns. Like the company they worked for, some of the clowns weren&#8217;t clowns in the true sense. This one looked like Albert Einstein on a bad hair day, wearing clothes more suited to an orchestra conductor but looking like he&#8217;d slept in them for a week. The only make-up he wore was rouge on his nose to make it look bright red. Like in performances past, he was the designated shit-disturber.<br />
He would walk to the entrance, and &#8220;help&#8221; people to their seats. This usually involved leading them to an entirely different place of the seating area than the ticket indicated, and even onto the stage. If the patron happened to be carrying food (usually popcorn), he would take the bag and start eating, spilling, throwing, or giving it away. Eventually one of the people he led behind stage &#8220;threw&#8221; him out of the theatre. It wasn&#8217;t the last time we saw him during the performance.<br />
The show began with a sudden explosion. The thrust portion of the stage and part of the main stage were comprised of four hydraulic lifts that went down about five metres below the level of the stage. When we arrived, the hole left behind bubbled with smoke. When the show started, that smoke concealed the first chapter of the show.<br />
Kodo is a Japanese art, usually several men and women drumming rhythmically on tom-toms of various sizes and usually on at least one huge double-drum. Some of the cast of Cirque du Soleil learned Kodo &#8230; they learned it well. I had never actually seen it before, and I was immediately blown away by the sound they made.<br />
The sound seemed to come from all around, much like a good home entertainment system generates high quality surround sound. But I quickly realized that in addition to the dozen or so drummers on the lifting stage, there were also four drummers being lowered from the ceiling along the semi-circular path leading to the audience seating. I had to admit, that was the best entrance I had ever seen.<br />
Now I&#8217;m not going to tell you everything I saw, and there&#8217;s good reasons for this. First, I honestly don&#8217;t remember everything I saw or in what order I saw it. Secondly, this was the kind of show you really need to see for yourself. If you&#8217;re reading this some many years from now, long after Treasure Island has closed (or been destroyed), I realize that this simply will frustrate you, and I apologize. But I can no more describe the awesome skill of these performers any more than I can tell you exactly what the Grand Canyon looks like, or the boredom experienced crossing Kansas.<br />
One portion of the show in particular that stuck with me for its sheer beauty was the balancing act. This was two men, both totally hairless, wearing very small bikini briefs, and completely covered with white powder. One of them would take hold of the other, bending outwards. The other would bend in a different direction to counter the weight. One such impressive example was when they formed a straight line about eight feet long, only one of them with his feet on the ground.<br />
Their motions were totally fluid, the positions they held requiring the utmost strength, agility, and flexibility. The act was so beautifully done, I even had to nudge Rebecca and ask her if I was the only one who thought the scene was very sexual. I wasn&#8217;t alone, but I wasn&#8217;t as excited as Rebecca, who had to fan herself at the end of the sequence.<br />
The trapeze act supplied me with the reason for live music. The trapeze was a group of ten people suspended in a rectangular box about 15 metres in length. The box was divided into eighths, with the fourth and fifth sections forming a single block. Below the second and seventh eighths were swings. At each of the lines dividing the eighths were horizontal bars around which the performers would swing, catapulting themselves around the length of the box. The performers on the swings would periodically catch one of the other performers leaping from another part of the frame, or would fling a performer to the other side.<br />
At one point in the show, one of the performers was getting ready to execute what looked like a flip. He swung around the bar between the third and fourth sections, and built up a great deal of momentum. Whether he lost his grip or let go too early I couldn&#8217;t tell, but the next thing he knew, he shot right into the swing mounted below the second section. It was a fairly stiff impact, and it was obvious that he was hurt.<br />
If MystÃ¯ ¿ ½re had a linear sound track, played from a CD or a master tape, the cues would had to have been so precise that no errors could have ever been committed during any of the performances. When the trapeze accident occurred, there was a pause of about twenty to thirty seconds before anyone moved. But the band played on. Stefan and I debated whether or not the act was cut short as a result of the accident, but by the musical score being played, you really couldn&#8217;t tell.<br />
The show ended almost the same way it started, with Kodo. This time the music was much longer and had more bold patterning of the beats than at the beginning of the show. This was due in part to the addition of another performer who seemed to be well-gifted with Kodo. With a few final echoing beats, the show ended, the cast and musicians took their bows, and we headed towards the exits.<br />
On the way out, Rebecca and I stopped to purchase copies of MystÃ¯ ¿ ½re&#8217;s soundtrack from the Cirque du Soleil shop, next to the snack bar of the theatre. It wasn&#8217;t a cheap purchase, but when you&#8217;ve heard the music, you really don&#8217;t mind so much.<br />
After forcing our way through an ocean of slow-moving show-goers, we headed back to our hotel room if for nothing else than to drop off our purchases. I also wanted to grab my camera before continuing with our grand plan for the evening: to tour The Strip and see all that we could see. The idea was to keep wandering until we either got bored or became exhausted (though if you want my honest opinion, it&#8217;s pretty damn difficult to get bored in Vegas if you&#8217;re only there a couple of days.)<br />
Dhar was lying on the bed when we came in. If his hair had been any longer, it might have been standing on end, he looked that frayed. Apparently the three and a half hours he had been on his own had been quite interesting. First off, he didn&#8217;t have dinner alone. Finding his way to an unnamed restaurant in the area, he found himself accompanying some woman (with an undisclosed appearance) who had been stood up for a dinner date. Following Dhar&#8217;s insistence that nothing else transpired with this mysterious woman, he proceeded to wander up and down The Strip.<br />
And Dhar got into trouble. Again. Dhar was very good at this, he seldom needed to try. According to our illustrious travel partner, he was out taking pictures of some of the huge neon and incandescent signs that litter either side of The Strip, and walked into a vacant lot to get a clear shot of The Dunes (I think &#8230; I may remember the hotel&#8217;s name incorrectly). No sooner than Dhar took the picture that a car sped into the lot and a couple very large burly men charged at him. Dhar didn&#8217;t bother to hang around and find out what they wanted.<br />
The four members of our Mission Impossible Force reassembled, we engaged in yet another riveting debate as what to occupy ourselves with. Stefan decided to make use of the washroom and change into something a little more casual. Dhar continued to lie on the bed, doubly worn out from his escapades of the evening and his lack of sleep from the night before. Rebecca and I stared out the window overlooking Buccaneer Bay, a reoccurring recreation of a ship battle, performed every 90 minutes during the evenings.<br />
In the smaller of the two pools, on the left side (as a spectator would view it from the sidewalk) was the &#8220;pirate&#8221; ship. It was about 30 metres long, the deck about five metres above the water, masts extending 30 or so metres into the air. Over all it was a fairly impressive looking vessel. It was a shame that it would never float on its own. The water in the pool wasn&#8217;t very deep, and it was obvious that the ship was attached to the bottom of the pool &#8212; it didn&#8217;t bob in the water at all.<br />
At the very right side of the pool was a very narrow channel, running about 50 metres down the edge of the sidewalk to the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Spring Mountain Road. This was where the Britannia (the English ship) resided. It was equally impressive in design, but we didn&#8217;t get a good look at it until it rounded the corner and came into the pool during the show.<br />
By about 17:50, the crowd had formed firmly, and it was becoming very hard to move around. I couldn&#8217;t help think that this gathering constituted a safety risk of some kind &#8212; getting emergency health services through the throng would be a near impossibility. And there was no sign of either Dhar or Stefan. We were wondering if we could hold places for them any longer.<br />
Then Rebecca caught sight of her mate through the herd. It never ceases to amaze me how women (particularly those with significant others) can do that. It took me a great deal of concentration and a few moving people before I figured out where they were. Rebecca started shouting to Stefan, trying to attract his attention. For some reason, Stefan never once looked in our direction, nor did Dhar. Not wanting to have to hunt over hell and half-of-creation to find them after the show, I decided to risk minor embarrassment and attract their attention by the best way I knew how: volume.<br />
If there is but one gift I received from my father, it was being loud. I seem to have a naturally loud voice. It may not carry too far, but I frequently get asked to quiet down. (This was most noticeable when I was in elementary school.) I cupped my hands around my mouth, breathed deeply, and bellowed: &#8220;STEFAN!&#8221; For a brief moment, just about everyone on the sidewalk waiting for the show to start fell silent. Everyone wanted to know who the hell this Stefan character was. I couldn&#8217;t help but feel somewhat smug &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t attracted that much attention since I was in Grade 5. (My teacher humiliated me in front of my class when, in my boredom, I played &#8220;rocket ship&#8221; with my face.)<br />
Dhar didn&#8217;t stick around long though. We learned that Dhar hates crowds. And I don&#8217;t mean that he has a dislike for them &#8212; he really anathematizes them. His eyes looked wild, like he was having trouble breathing (he probably was). His voice wavered ever so slightly, like someone who could feel the walls closing in on him (he probably could). Before he got trapped in the living sardine can, he headed south (in the direction of the Mirage) to wait for the show to end.<br />
A loud fanfare about five minutes later announced the show&#8217;s start. The Britannia &#8220;sailed&#8221; down the channel and entered Buccaneer Bay, interrupting the pirate crew as they attempted to unload their stolen booty. A slight argument ensued where the captain of the Britannia attempted to order the pirates to surrender, to which the pirates politely refused by firing a cannon at the Britannia.<br />
At this point an all-out fire-fight began. Parts of either ship were blown up, apart, or off, and various part of the surrounding decor suffered slight to serious damage. (At one point, a tremendous butane-powered fireball erupts from one of the upper-level &#8220;buildings&#8221;.) The parts that fall apart were collapsible, and easily reassembled for the next showing.<br />
The sequence ends when the pirates, in a last-ditch attempt to save their scurvy hides, blow a &#8220;hole&#8221; in the side of the Britannia, which starts listing to port and sinks into Buccaneer Bay. The engineering that went into the Britannia was impressive: not only did the gantry on which the ship &#8220;sails&#8221; into the bay have to contend with corners, but it had to tilt the huge vessel into the bay, then raise it back up (undoubtedly full of water).<br />
The show ended with the Vegas clichÃ¯ ¿ ½: you&#8217;ve seen our show, now come in and lose your money. Okay, it&#8217;s not that blatant, but the principle is the same. Not surprisingly though, few took up the offer and went in (unless they were staying there). Most decided to go in the same direction we wanted to go &#8212; south, towards Dhar. The sheer number of people made it difficult to move, and even more difficult to find Dhar.<br />
We passed by the Imperial Palace, the Flamingo Hilton, and the Barbary Coast resorts before arriving at Flamingo Road. Along the way, Dhar and I took several pictures of the various resorts on both sides of The Strip, including the Mirage hotel and Caesar&#8217;s Palace. Dhar had already taken several pictures of The Strip (he claimed to have walked up and down it three times before going out with us), but that didn&#8217;t stop him from taking some additional, albeit strange, pictures. (One was taken outside Imperial Palace, looking right up the side of what appeared to be a paddlewheel &#8212; the entire facade was like a Mississippi steamboat.)<br />
The seedy side of Las Vegas began to show through. During the day the strong cleansing rays of the sun drive the scum and cockroaches into the shadows, you hardly ever see them. But at night the roads are lined with the dregs of society: drunkards (though many could have been tourists &#8212; only in Vegas do the drunkards dress well), beggars (many appeared to be ex-tourists who lost their proverbial shirts at the gambling table, most looking for &#8220;bus fare&#8221;), hookers, and if you looked carefully, the dealers.<br />
But by far the most noticeable and despicable mendicants were the magazine distributors. Remember the prostitute magazine that Stefan had been looking for the night before? You didn&#8217;t need to look on Las Vegas Boulevard &#8212; the distributors found you. And they didn&#8217;t care in the least who they gave them out to. Men, women, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they even gave them to children. You didn&#8217;t even have to chance a glance at one of them to have a magazine thrust against you.<br />
I really didn&#8217;t know which was sadder: the prostitutes advertising in the magazine, or the people giving them out. One would expect men, and some pretty sleazy ones at that. We were not disappointed in that regard. I was surprised, and somewhat shocked, to see several women dealing the adverts. It takes a lot to shock me, and that wasn&#8217;t something I was expecting. But it wasn&#8217;t the mere fact that women were doing this &#8212; it was the look on their faces as they did it. I couldn&#8217;t tell what the expression meant exactly, but the disgust of what they held, the despair of what they had to do, and sadness all seemed to exude through the leathery skin of their Latin-American faces. What they did was below begging, and they knew it.<br />
I personally have a thing against prostitution as well. I find it to be the most degrading thing a human can do &#8212; selling their bodies to survive, often in disregard of their well-being. Mind you, I frown upon pimps even more, they force others into harlotry so they can literally steal from those they &#8220;employ&#8221;. In Las Vegas, prostitution is legal &#8230; but no more moral or ethical than anywhere else. If the gambling alone doesn&#8217;t do it, the addition of prostitution certainly earns Vegas the name &#8220;Sin City&#8221;.<br />
We stopped for a while at Bally&#8217;s, pondering whether we wound venture inside and see what its casino was like. But we opted instead to stay outside and take a few pictures and look at the light sculptures Bally&#8217;s had installed. One such group was a series of tall semi-circular pillars that slowly changed colours. Against the background of gardens and fountains, they were beautiful to watch.<br />
We pressed onward along Las Vegas Boulevard heading south. Between Bally&#8217;s and the MGM Grand, there was only the Holiday Inn Boardwalk hotel on the opposite side of the street, which wasn&#8217;t much to look at. The MGM Grand on the other hand, was a very impressive sight. Currently the largest casino in Las Vegas (and possibly the world), the immense building glowed with a light green that was so appealing, we actually stopped to stare at it for a while.<br />
At the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue we found the majestic MGM Grand entrance, the huge stylized MGM lion guarding the gates. It never crossed our minds to go inside, we were more intent on seeing more of The Strip at the time. From the intersection&#8217;s corner we could see the Tropicana (south of the MGM Grand, across Tropicana Avenue), and the Excalibur (south-west of the MGM Grand, on the diagonal corner). The Tropicana was nothing special in its appearance, but the Excalibur&#8217;s bold white and blue construction, bathed in a strong white light was something to behold.<br />
Built along Arthurian styles, the Excalibur featured a castle structure (which undoubtedly contained the casino), and two long hotel wings built on either side of the castle. The castle sported several towers and spires, all topped with bright blue caps which seemed to glow even at night. (They didn&#8217;t glow nearly as bright as the top of the Luxor, just south of Excalibur.)<br />
The intersection of Tropicana and The Strip had no crosswalks, even though there didn&#8217;t seem to be any reason for the oversight. However, in lieu of paint on the asphalt, someone built two pedestrian overpasses: one running over The Strip on the north side of Tropicana, and another over Tropicana on the west side of The Strip. This effectively linked Excalibur with MGM Grand.<br />
We hopped up the escalator to the first overpass and made our way to the north-west corner. And into our view came the next big thing to hit Las Vegas: New York, New York. A venture between the MGM Grand and another company, New York, New York would create a condensed skyline of the city for which it was named. Still under construction while we were there, even the darkened half-skeleton of the resort was impressive. A construction office on the ground level had a model of the soon-to-be casino, offering a free night&#8217;s stay at the hotel when it opened. Judging from what I saw, the next time I&#8217;m in Las Vegas, I want to stay at New York New York.<br />
We crossed the next overpass to Excalibur, and went inside. By now, my legs were hurting. We had not walked that far, but for some strange reason I was utterly exhausted. Stefan and Rebecca weren&#8217;t much better off, so at least I didn&#8217;t feel like a weakling. Dhar, on the other hand, had every right to be feeling a little tired.<br />
After traveling down the long walkway inside (Dhar rode the moving sidewalk instead), we entered into a true Vegas casino: tacky in every sense of the word. Gold trim, gaudy fixtures, ugly carpets &#8230; the whole eyesore shebang. Simply from its appearance, I judged it to be a leftover from the heady days of the &#8217;70&#8217;s, when tacky was the norm. Much to my surprise, I learned that Excalibur was opened in 1991.<br />
The slots called again, but not before Dhar purchased what he, Stefan, and Rebecca called a horrid drink. Served in a large tacky bluish glass (part of the reason, I think, that Dhar bought it in the first place), it was supposed to have Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, orange juice, and a couple other things thrown in for taste. Apparently it didn&#8217;t work too well as a whole.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before we found the ultimate slots: if you won, you got to drive home a brand-new Dodge Viper. At a quarter a pull, it was the most expensive slots they played. But with little success. By this point, I had reached the end of the second stage of Lasvegasitis, and suddenly found myself in stage three: I wanted to try my luck at the slots.<br />
But I knew that my luck was horrible, it always was, and I chickened out of the dollar slot machine. Instead I plunked three nickels into a one-armed bandit and promptly lost. My grand total gambling losses to date amount to $2.15 ($2 Canadian, $0.15 American) &#8230; though I suspect I lost the $2 more to theft than to gambling, but that&#8217;s a whole other story.<br />
Finding our general luck to be rather dismal, we headed towards the south hotel wing and the exit. We wanted to go that way so we could get to the Luxor with a minimum amount of effort. All of us were feeling rather worn out, it was looking like we wouldn&#8217;t see anything else that night. I really wanted to see Fremont Street and the lighted ceiling, but I began to accept that it would have to wait until another trip.<br />
The walk to Luxor was a short one. The closer we got to the hotel the smaller it looked. Whenever I saw the Luxor on TV or in a magazine, I equated the black pyramid-shaped building to the Egyptian pyramids on the Giza plateau. Although I&#8217;d not been to Egypt, it was plain to see that Luxor was a much smaller scale development.<br />
The inside of Luxor was &#8230; unspectacular, I was not impressed at all. Although the architect had placed all the rooms on the outside of the hotel, running diagonal elevators along the edges to service the 20 or so levels, it just didn&#8217;t look awesome enough. The interior was large enough to hold 14 Boeing 747 airplanes. But even that fact didn&#8217;t look impressive. It might have been my lack of energy, something which would make even the MGM Grand start to look dull.<br />
We unfortunately missed out on a tour that the Luxor ran, which I completely forgot about while we were there. It was a three-part multimedia virtual-reality spectacular that got rave reviews for the level of technology it used. But in a way the loss wasn&#8217;t so bad &#8212; more too look forward to the next time &#8217;round the block.<br />
After only a few minutes we decided to head back to our hotel room. But we made it only as far as the front door before hailing a cab. The taxi driver was an interesting fellow, he gave us his personal view of Las Vegas which essentially amounted to our trip&#8217;s motto: Been there, done that &#8230; next!<br />
A few minutes later we were back at the hotel, and hungry. But the ice cream parlour that I had so wanted to visit closed at midnight, we were over an hour late to gorge ourselves on frozen delights. We turned instead to one of the lower-rung restaurants, just off of Treasure Island&#8217;s casino. Keno boards could be seen on every wall, updating their information about every half-hour or so.<br />
There seemed to be a certain curtness about the wait-staff, almost like they wanted to have us complain and get them fired &#8230; almost. My desire for ice cream vanished, and I instead ordered a hot meal and a cold beer. I followed Stefan&#8217;s suggestion and ordered a Heineken. Until that point, I hadn&#8217;t found any light-coloured beers that I liked. Most had this a aftertaste that bothered me. But when all was said and done, the Heineken wasn&#8217;t so bad.<br />
One of the bartenders stared regularly at Dhar. We wondered why: possibly Dhar&#8217;s blue bandanna, which he wore almost constantly after the Grand Canyon. In any case, Dhar was about ready to start causing trouble when our bill arrived. We paid and left before Dhar got us ejected from the hotel.<br />
Dhar and I slept on cots that night, and it felt good to sleep on an honest-to-God mattress with sheets around my legs. I didn&#8217;t need to worry about Dhar&#8217;s snoring that night, I think I actually fell asleep before he did.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Viva Las Vegas! More specifically, Cirque du Soleil. What an amazing show. We walked part of The Strip tonight, but we never made it to Fremont before we were worn out. Dhar went off on his own and sounded like he almost scored&#8230; Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day&#8230;</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Morning began almost the same as Colorado Springs: cool and bright. But our distance south had provided us with a few degrees more warmth, making the morning not quite as shocking as the day before. Something else was different &#8212; no humidity on the walls. Once again Dhar was the first to rise, followed by myself, Stefan, and eventually, Rebecca.<br />
I got my first good look at the camp that morning. It looked smaller than the one in Colorado Springs, but then again Cortez wasn&#8217;t exactly the place to travel (or at least so I thought when I first got up that morning). Under the navigator&#8217;s windshield wiper was a small piece of paper, left by the camp management. It was a reminder to check in at the office that morning. It was the first and last such reminder we saw staying at the KOAs.<br />
There&#8217;s something about waking up at Cortez that I never really could quite comprehend. Cortez is mostly a flat plain, wedged between a few mountain ranges quite some distance apart. A few mesas interrupt the vastness, but not so much that it&#8217;s disturbing. Morning there is extremely peaceful. There&#8217;s no highway, no clamouring industry, no planes. It&#8217;s quiet. It&#8217;s slow. It&#8217;s too bad we couldn&#8217;t have spent the day there relaxing. But we had things to do, places to see.<br />
Showers were the first order of the day. The stalls were much better than the ones in Colorado Springs, as we now had two taps to control the water&#8217;s temperature. I hastened back to the van to get dressed and prepare for the drive out to the Grand Canyon, as that was the primary goal of the day. Secondary to that was a stop at Four Corners.<br />
Stefan arrived a moment later, allowing Rebecca to go and have her shower. Stefan quickly gathered up his wallet-pouch and headed over to the office to clear up any issues with our late check-in. I sauntered into the office a few minutes later and looked over some of the things they had in the store. I purchased more postcards and stamps while Stefan got the bill straightened out.<br />
No sooner had I stepped up to pay for my purchases than Stefan announced we had a change in plans for the day. My immediate reaction was one of annoyance, since he had not discussed this change with anyone so far. He quickly clarified himself by asking if I&#8217;d ever heard of Mesa Verde, to which I responded I had. He then informed me that it was about 10 miles away from our camp. I suddenly realized two things: 1) Why there was a KOA in Cortez, and 2) We were going to be late getting to the Grand Canyon.<br />
We informed Rebecca and Dhar of the slight change in plans when we got back to the Behemoth. Fortunately, neither objected to the change, even though none of us really knew what we were getting ourselves in to. The van was disconnected from the water and electricity, the oil and fluids checked, and a couple water bottles filled. I then took my position behind the wheel and headed us back towards Highway 160. We turned right and headed east.<br />
The trip was fairly short, we could see the mesas just to the south-east. We passed a sign indicating a radio frequency we could listen to park information on. The quality of the broadcast was horrible, but thankfully short, taking only about seven minutes to tell us all that we needed to know. It wasn&#8217;t long after the sign that the part entrance appeared.<br />
The park entrance off Highway 160 was 26 miles from the Visitor&#8217;s Center, which was where we had to go before we could find out what it was that we had to see. For some reason, this was either the most direct (or the safest) route into the park. I found it hard to believe that it was shorter for us to drive to the park entrance from the KOA than to get into the park itself. After paying our five dollar (American) entrance fee, we entered the second harrowing drive in as many days.<br />
The park, like the structures it was designed to showcase and protect, was situated on the top of a huge mesa, over 750 feet above Highway 160. The road to get to that height had to bend around the edges of the mesa and slowly take us to the top. The views we saw were as beautiful as the ones we had seen the day before traveling through the mountain ranges. Only here we were treated to a completely different palette of colours: browns, reds, oranges, and greens. Off in the distance the Rockies were still visible, their white peaks reminding us of days past.<br />
The route was lined with steep cliffs on one side and steep hills on the other. Although the speed limit was significantly higher than at Cave of the Winds, I chose to drive cautiously and not look over the edge unless we were stopped. This didn&#8217;t stop the others from peering out, oohing and ahhing, and telling me not too look. What I did keep an eye out for were the foxes, deer, and wild turkeys that were supposed to live in the area. (Although I didn&#8217;t want to hit a fox or a deer, a wild turkey would have made a great change in our dinner menu.)<br />
About 45 minutes after entering the park, the Visitor&#8217;s Center came into view as we rounded a corner. It was an interesting structure: a two-storey circular building with a spiraling ramp around the outside. The building was on the left side of the road we were on, and the Visitor&#8217;s Center parking lot was on the right. The two were connected by a walkway underpass.<br />
Upon entering the parking lot we saw our first vehicle from Canada, a beat-up orange Ford camper from Alberta. I wanted to find the drivers and swap stories, but we had no such luck. We wandered under the road and up the ramp on the other side. The building had a balcony that overlooked an area exceeding 5,000 square miles on a hazy day. (On a clear day, it was said you could see all the way to Phoenix, Arizona &#8212; about 300 miles away.)<br />
But a clear day hadn&#8217;t been seen at the Visitor&#8217;s Center since the late 50&#8217;s. The sign told of a major problem that had befallen the area: air pollution. Although the nearest industrial centre was some 100 miles away, the problem had not gone unnoticed. Just southwest of the park I could see a long brown cloud. At first I had thought it might be a dust storm, the deserts and the wind in that region of the United States are known for dust storms. But after reading the sign, I knew that such a cloud could only be one thing: smog.<br />
I have lived in a city all my life, I have seen pollution in many forms. In a way, I have come accustomed and maybe even immune to seeing it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I don&#8217;t like pollution &#8212; I&#8217;m all for different ways of getting rid of it safely. It&#8217;s just that if you stare at something long enough, you tend not to notice it as much. Toronto has a brownish haze to it for most of the summer months, and once in a while during the winter. Inside the city you&#8217;ll never notice a thing.<br />
Outside the city my perspectives change, and where there are lots of trees, I expect clean fresh air. Colorado Springs had such air. But Mesa Verde is surrounded by nothingness for hundreds of miles. And yet the air pollution was worse than in an industrial centre. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should weep for the environment, for our children, or for the Native Americans who had to live in that pollution. In a way the only winners are those who profit at the expense of everything and everyone else.<br />
Inside the doors was a combination park information desk, bookstore, and museum. Two park rangers presided over the desk, providing information on the park and the tours, and taking fees for the guided tours. The park had three main sites open at the time we were there including two cliff dwellings and a small restored village.<br />
Mesa Verde sound familiar yet? If the name doesn&#8217;t ring a bell, a picture of it would. Over two thousand years ago, a group of Indians called the Anasazi settled on Mesa Verde and began their culture here. Related to the Pueblo Indians, they brought the craft of building adobe huts for shelter with them. But out in the open, they found life very harsh. In an attempt to build villages that would withstand the often brutal environment, they built cities into the cliffs.<br />
If you&#8217;ve ever seen a picture of a city built into the side of a small mountain, then you&#8217;ve most likely seen Cliff Palace, which is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. Because of its size and history, it&#8217;s also the only cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde that you can&#8217;t visit without a Park Ranger. Thus there is a cost for the tour, not only in cash, but in time &#8212; in excess of two hours. Cost for us wasn&#8217;t an issue (usually), but time was. We opted to do a self-guided tour of smaller dwellings.<br />
After figuring out our plan of attack, we did a tour of the museum. Although small for a museum of Native Indians, the exhibits contained pottery, jewelry, clothes, and pictures of at least eight different tribes of Indians. Many of these things I had seen before in documentaries, National Geographic and other museums, so in truth, I wasn&#8217;t all that interested in them. I started to goad the others into hastier actions, since I wanted to get to the Grand Canyon before it got dark.<br />
We got back in the van and drove further down the road we had traveled on. About seven or so miles down the road we arrived a parking lot surrounded by a gift shop and toilets on one side, and another museum on the other. All around us beyond the buildings were small trees, no greater than three metres tall. Unlike the deciduous trees further north, these had their leaves.<br />
Mesa Verde must have received its name from these shrub-like trees. In English, Mesa Verde translates roughly to &#8220;green plateau&#8221;. Unlike the plains next to Highway 160, the ground on the mesa was completely covered in trees &#8212; you couldn&#8217;t see more than five metres into the forest.<br />
We hopped out and began to figure out how to get down to the dwellings. We walked to the end of the parking lot (about twenty metres) and crossed over to the other side of the road next to another museum. There we quickly found more paths that seemed to lead into a small valley just beyond the museum. The trees continually blocked our view until we found a jutting of sedimentary rock upon which no tree grew. Climbing out on top of it, we caught our first glimpse of the dwellings on the opposite side of the valley.<br />
As a kid, someone could have easily labeled me as a nerd (not to mention that someone still could) &#8212; I always read. The books I read were rarely fiction. I preferred the sort of books that explained the world around me. Not being religious, I received my explanations from scientific bases. National Geographic took me around the world, Time-Life taught me how the world was formed and why continents drift, and PBS showed me sights I never thought I&#8217;d see.<br />
When I went to the Soviet Union in 1989, I saw things I had only heard of before and saw on the odd documentary or in a rare issue of National Geographic. I knew then that experience was no replacement for a facsimile. A picture may tell a thousand words, but an experience shows you the world. As with my first look at the Rocky Mountains, my initial glimpse of the dwellings was both exciting and awe-inspiring. And I was hungry for more.<br />
The route to the dwellings took us down the one side of the valley (a drop of less than 150 feet), across the floor and slightly up the other side. Along the way were markers that indicated points of interest, listed on a small map Rebecca had picked up prior to us descending into the valley. The map showed different types of flora that grew in the valley, and places where the Anasazi had scraped out a living.<br />
One of these places was at the apex of the valley, where a small spring was located. The spring formed when rain water and melting snow leaked through the rock and pooled. It was dry when we arrived, and I wondered if it had been wet any time in the past decade.<br />
But it was the dwellings we had come to see. There was something almost magical about stepping near them, like the spirits of the past were watching us. They watched from the darkened windows, through deep doorways, and from the trees that grew behind us. Whether they were smiling upon us for remembering their history or passing a curse that would last for generations, we didn&#8217;t know.<br />
The cave the dwellings were built into was roughly 150 metres long, 20 metres deep and about 30 metres high. The roof of the cave sloped down from the full height of 30 metres down to less than 10 at the rear. Rather, the rear that we could see. The dwellings were roped off in several strategic places to keep visitors from crawling all over the site. In the past this had been allowed, but assumedly over time things got damaged.<br />
The dwellings were an impressive sight, if only from their history &#8212; the buildings were nearly 2,000 years old. According to the Park Ranger, the Anasazi abandoned the dwellings long before the Roman Empire crumbled. Yet here were structures as high as three stories, made of stone, mud, and cedar logs. The assemblage looked flimsy by appearance, but must have been very strong to have withstood the elements for so long with so little damage. The walls of the buildings ran from the cave floor to the cave ceiling, which must have provided a great deal of structural integrity. The cedar logs inside the towers must also have contributed to the longevity.<br />
Just outside the cave were large holes, about 6 metres across and a just under three metres deep. At first I had no idea what they were, until I noticed a ladder seemingly coming out of the ground. The holes were ceremonial chambers (the name of which completely escapes me) that were dug into the ground then covered over with logs and flagstones. Small holes just outside the hole&#8217;s walls allowed air to enter the chamber and fan fires that burned inside.<br />
For some reason, Stefan took objection to the Park Ranger&#8217;s explanation of the hole&#8217;s use as a ceremonial chamber. (I had not been aware that Queen&#8217;s Engineers were required to take anthropology courses. ) Stefan believed they were sweat houses, similar to the ones used by other tribes.<br />
After touring the site for about half an hour, I started to goad the others into moving again. I wanted to make sure we&#8217;d get to our destinations while we still had light. A group of Native American schoolchildren who appeared to have come to the Park to learn about their heritage passed us as we slowly began to work our way back up the side of the valley.<br />
The climb back up was much more difficult than it looked. I wasn&#8217;t sure my exhaustion was due to the altitude (hence, lack of oxygen) or my general physical shape (which I wasn&#8217;t in). Either way, I was fairly winded by the time we got back to the top. A woman in front of me didn&#8217;t even make it that far before she had to sit down to catch her breath.<br />
Despite my goading, Rebecca ducked into the museum. We naturally followed to see what was there. The museum showcased some aspects of life the Visitor&#8217;s Center didn&#8217;t touch upon. Methods of weaving, how the cliff dwellings came into being, and general ways of life. A slide show in an adjacent room provided a more in depth view of Anasazi life, but we never got a chance to see it. Instead we browsed the museum&#8217;s gift shop.<br />
Somewhere along the time we got briefly separated and we lost track of Rebecca. While Stefan and Dhar wandered up to the main gift shop, I waited in the van to make sure Rebecca wouldn&#8217;t walk by unnoticed. As it turned out, we men were blind and had missed Rebecca while she was in the museum. Soon we were all buckled in and heading back out towards Highway 160.</p>

Mesa Verde &#8211; a mystery? Many will speculate, but the truth will never be known &#8211; long drive to get there though. Next step is the 4 Corners, then (with any luck) the Grand Canyon.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We all agreed that the excursion had been worth it. None of us had seen anything like it before and I shuddered to think that I might not see anything like it again. To think that a people that every text lists as &#8220;primitive&#8221; could build such an impressive and enduring city is to not acknowledge the genius that was at work, and also to not acknowledge how far we haven&#8217;t come in those 1,000 years since the village was abandoned.<br />
On the trip back, we were heading mostly downhill. The van handled moderately better than on the way up, but I was still a bit edgy. Somewhere on this trip down the van was named by a member of our group (though who it was I honestly don&#8217;t remember) &#8212; &#8220;The Behemoth&#8221;. The name seemed very appropriate: it handled like a dead mule, accelerated like a turtle on tranquilizers, and braked like a marble on a greased roadway down a hill. We could see over almost anything on the road except semi-trailers and cube vans. We could comfortably sleep four adults. This was no ordinary vehicle.<br />
Upon reaching Highway 160, I turned left and headed back towards Cortez, where we would briefly link up with Highway 666 before heading southwest towards the Four Corners. The sound of The Beach Boys echoed through the van as we whipped through the downtown core of Cortez, a distance of about four miles. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were cruising down Highway 666 towards Shiprock, New Mexico.<br />
Surprisingly enough, it took a while for someone else to notice what highway we were traveling on. It came as quite a surprise to the others that there was in fact a highway named &#8220;666&#8221;, especially when one considers that according to Christian doctrines, that&#8217;s the number of the Beast. But if there is a highway to hell, the Highway 666 is it. The south end of Colorado and well into New Mexico is barren &#8212; no trees, hardly any shrubs, no water, a few lonely mesas and hundreds of dry river beds.<br />
Shiprock wasn&#8217;t our destination however, and we left Highway 666 about seven miles from the Colorado / New Mexico border to continue along Highway 160. But not before we pulled over to take a picture documenting to the Doubting Thomases back home that the Americans did in fact worship the Devil in some parts of the country.<br />
By this time, we were well into Indian country. We entered the Ute Mountain Indian Reservation about 10 miles outside Cortez. When we entered Arizona we crossed into the Navajo Indian Reservation for some 200 miles of desolation, ending at the Kaibab National Forest.<br />
It was the desolation that I found most intriguing. The American government had taken all the Native Indians and had placed them in this area of the United States. According to Rebecca, there had been a study published by the Government about the area several decades ago which claimed that the area was unsuitable for farming, fishing, raising cattle, industry, commerce, and living in general. On the top of the report there was the ink of a rubber stamp: Suitable for Indians. The truly depressing part is that it wasn&#8217;t an American government &#8212; it was Canadian. I didn&#8217;t want to know what the American governments had done.<br />
We didn&#8217;t come into contact with any Native Indians until we reached the Four Corners. The Four Corners is the only geographic / political location in the United States where four states touch at a common point. I always imagined that the four corners were marked by white chalk stones on the top of a grassy hill, kind of like the one featured in Coca-Cola commercials I had seen. But we were in an area that had no trees, let alone grass, and the only hills were steep-faced mesas.<br />
Highway 160 briefly enters New Mexico before going into Arizona, it was from the New Mexico corner that we entered the site. Existing in designated Ute Indian territory, the Ute Indians managed the Four Corners allowing members of other tribes to enter and sell their wares to tourists. At first everyone was dismayed at the five dollar entry fee to look at some lines in the dirt. I was quick to point out however that Native Indians have always had a hard shake from the Government (United States or Canadian), never receiving true compensation for all that they have lost. As far as I was concerned, five dollars was a very reasonable price.<br />
Four Corners is, to put it politely, a very basic tourist trap. The actual location of the four state corners (which, in all honesty, ain&#8217;t much to look at) is ringed by about 30 wooden stalls where Native Indians sell &#8220;authentic&#8221; Indian crafts and food. Quite often, so I&#8217;ve found in the past, many of the crafts are made in Taiwan, and the food comes from local 7-11s (though if there was a local 7-11 at Four Corners, someone went to great lengths to camouflage it). I didn&#8217;t go up to the stalls to verify my suspicions, so you may assume that I am incorrect in my beliefs.<br />
The Four Corners is essentially a large light grey concrete square about six metres across, with two lines running diagonally forming an &#8216;X&#8217; in the middle. At the apex of the &#8216;X&#8217; is a large dark grey circle, about a metre in diametre. In each of the four triangles formed by the &#8216;X&#8217; is the appropriate state&#8217;s name and seal. Tubular railing mounted all over the concrete platform ruined the site for me, there was no way to take a picture without getting at least ten metres of the stuff in the frame.<br />
Rebecca took the opportunity to review the stalls, while Dhar and I remained in the centre of the roadway. Both of us felt guilty about walking by the stalls and not buying anything. I felt guilty in general about the treatment of Indians, both in the U.S. and in Canada. Alas, my personal beliefs are not shared by many. While I believe the Indians should be allowed to settle wherever they want, many people I&#8217;ve overheard in conversations go with more Darwinist tactics &#8212; we beat them, they deserve nothing. It&#8217;s that kind of attitude that causes strife in our world, and will eventually lead to the destruction of our civilization if left uncontrolled.<br />
It was almost 14:00 when we boarded the van once more, this time with Rebecca at the helm, for our long drive across the State of Arizona. It was over 200 miles to the Grand Canyon, and would take us just over three hours to get there. The worst part of the ordeal was that the temperature kept rising as we drove, and the air conditioner had been left off to conserve gasoline.<br />
The terrain, despite its given name of &#8220;Colorado Plateau&#8221;, was full of hills and valleys. The cruise control on the van continually shifted in and out of the overdrive to deal with the rises and falls. Several times we had to turn the cruise control off as we drove just keep the engine from sounding like it was going to burst from its housing. I shudder think what the engine would have sounded like with the air conditioning on.<br />
And I sometimes wished that the air conditioning was on. Less than a day before we were in the high teens for temperature, quite comfortable for those who had been in a long winter. But in Arizona those temperatures were easily doubled inside the van. Every window and vent that we could safely open blew and sucked warm air throughout the van. Rebecca took advantage of wearing her skirt by having the driver&#8217;s foot vent blow air right up her dress.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Supplementary</strong><br />
Arizona has one thing over Kansas &#8211; at least we can tell we&#8217;re actually getting somewhere. Kansas has one thing over Arizona &#8211; it&#8217;s much cooler. 80 degrees inside an enclosed space for four hours is going to hurt immensely. Rebecca got stuck with driving.We&#8217;re almost in the heart of the Navajo Indian Reservation. Have to feel sorry for them &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing here, not like there used to be when they lived in the Great Plains.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I do mean nothing. The majority of things we saw out there was sand and sun. The only place more desolate than that would be either the Sahara Desert, or Antarctica &#8212; they receive about the same amount of precipitation and have about equal ability to sustain life. That part of Arizona wasn&#8217;t too far behind.<br />
Only the movements of the mesa and rock formations told us that we were going anywhere. Kansas was too flat for any such markers. Once in a while we would spot a few Indians with their livestock, usually sheep or goats, grazing along the road on the wrong side of the fence.<br />
We passed one rather interesting anomaly along our route. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but it was certainly strange. We passed under what looked like a covered conveyor belt, running from a mesa about a kilometre or so from the highway. It continued across the highway to a large structure I could only define as a holding tank. Alongside the building was a single-track railroad, with electrical lines running along the route.<br />
Electric trains in North American are a rarity. Electric trains in the middle of Nowhere, Arizona are unheard of. Yet here was such a train. The tracks ran alongside the highway for about 50 miles or so before vanishing off into the distance. Not once did a train pass along the line, nor was there any signs indicating what it might be. Alas, it remains a mystery.<br />
Not quite as much a mystery was another of Stefan&#8217;s annoying habits, though probably only annoying to me. Stefan&#8217;s father, aside from being a brilliant engineer, was also an accomplished musician. I&#8217;ve found that children of musicians seem to have a keen ear for how things should sound. Almost every time we put on a new CD to listen to, Stefan would jump to the equalizer on the van&#8217;s stereo and fiddle with the controls. Several times I was tempted to slap his hands and tell him to keep the hell away from it. But I couldn&#8217;t entirely blame him &#8212; I&#8217;ve been known to do the same thing.<br />
This particular habit of Stefan&#8217;s was particularly common when he was navigator. One of the navigator&#8217;s duties, aside from figuring out where we were and which way we were supposed to travel, was put in new CDs every so often. And when Stefan was in charge of this, the equalizer controls were shifted. While this custom was annoying to me, I will grant that Stefan had a knack for making a mediocre CD playing on a portable CD player through a cassette deck adapter sound pretty damn good.<br />
Music was one of the few things that kept us sane as we crossed over large expanses of land. The north-east corner of Arizona was just such a case. We made few stops while passing through Navajo country, one of them was in at the Tuba City Booger Thing. Sorry, Burger King. (I&#8217;ve never been too fond of that particular fast-food franchise, the food never really sat well with me. The only Burger King in Oakville died in 1990 or 1991, and was replaced with a Tim Horton&#8217;s. A much better choice, if you ask me.)<br />
Everyone except me got something to eat. I wasn&#8217;t particularly hungry anyway, so I really didn&#8217;t care too much. Heat seldom makes me that hungry. Rebecca relinquished her driver&#8217;s position to Stefan. I took his place as navigator as we headed to the end of Highway 160 to pick up Highway 89. As Stefan drove, he continued to be amazed at how long we had been inside the Navajo Indian Reservation. I continued to be amazed at how dirty it was.<br />
So far, all of our tours on the highways of American, Interstate or otherwise, had been very pleasant. Everything had been clean. Now whether it was the fact that Highway 160 went through the middle of Navajo country and thus was excluded from Federal or State Transportation Departments I don&#8217;t know. But what I do know is that there was more garbage along the sides of those highways than my family generates in a year. It was disheartening to see such neglect, but I didn&#8217;t know who to blame: the governments, the Indians, or the motorists. Well, obviously the motorists&#8230;<br />
After leaving Highway 160 for Highway 89, we briefly headed south for 15 miles. We then resumed our westerly heading along Route 64, which took us into Kaibab National Forest, and eventually into the Grand Canyon National Park.<br />
I don&#8217;t know if it was the lack of food, the dehydration, sleeplessness, or the heat, but I was getting irritable. Really irritable. The moment we saw a canyon, Stefan&#8217;s eyes started to frequently leave the road and look into parts of the Grand Canyon. To be blunt, this pissed me off. We came close to the edge of a canyon wall once or twice, but the fact that he didn&#8217;t watch the road while we were driving was getting on my nerves. Several times I came close to telling him to pull the van over so I could drive. But before I worked up enough gumption to become a complete asshole, we entered more trees and Stefan was forced to return to the major job of driving.<br />
After paying a $7 entrance fee (valid for seven days), we proceeded to the first stop within the Park, known as the Watchtower. We could see the tower when we pulled in, but we didn&#8217;t proceed to it just yet, as we had other things to do first. Among them was a trip to the toilet, a tour through the first of two gift shops, and a call home.<br />
The Grand Canyon hardly had any visible signs of native animals, the only animals we saw were ravens. These were huge birds, about the size of a small turkey. They hopped around the picnic areas like the seagulls and terns we&#8217;re accustomed to back home. Dhar and I were a little surprised at the enormity of the birds, seemingly almost mutant.<br />
One of the gift shops was near to where we parked, and was one of our stops. I just knew that a gift shop in America&#8217;s best known natural wonder was going to have some of the gaudiest souvenirs ever concocted by man. I was not disappointed. I won&#8217;t tell you all that I saw, but there were t-shirts, hats, posters, cacti, and bandannas. Any place selling bandannas should be avoided. That&#8217;s not to say that places selling wall clocks made from slices of tree trunks, or cow dung for that matter, are any better.<br />
Outside the store was a phone, which Stefan and Rebecca made use of to contact their kids back home. Eric was loving the vacation from his end of the phone, because it meant that he didn&#8217;t have to go to school. Staying with the grandparents meant that he was too far from school to be taken in every day. I felt sorry for Stefan&#8217;s parents (who were minding the kids), I knew from first-hand experience just how hard it was to keep Eric calm for a mere five minutes, let alone 12 days.<br />
It was just after 18:00 in the afternoon when I finally got my first look at the Grand Canyon. We walked down a path away from both the parking lot and the gift shop, heading approximately north. Even though we were still a hundred metres from the edge of the gorge, we could already see the splendour that attracted tourists from around the world. It was yet another visual feast for the senses.<br />
Having formed from hundreds of millions of years of sedimentary rock, then millions more years of erosion from wind and water, the Grand Canyon is named as well as the English language can suffice. There is no equal to the intricacies and the blatant beauty of the canyon, nor is there a succinct enough word or phrase that can accurately describe it. Although I don&#8217;t know what the phrasing would be, the Native Indians probably have a word or a name in their languages that describes the Grand Canyon much better.<br />
The ochre and pale orange rock glowed in the setting sun, the entire valley looked like a giant ember from a dying fire. You could follow hundreds of layers of rock to the bottom of the canyon, where the deep turbulent blue of the Colorado River cooled the intensity of the view. By the time we reached the Watchtower&#8217;s position, we could see for what seemed a hundred miles north and east. Trees blocked our view to the south, and heavy haze shielded our glance to the west. Yet even that haze cast a heavenly glow about the deep &#8216;V&#8217; in the Earth, as if carved by the hands of gods.<br />
We basked in the warmth of the view and struggled in the stiff wind that blew through the canyon, taking several pictures of a sight I&#8217;ll probably not see for some time, if ever again. But soon curiousity won over my Grand experience, and I decided that a review of the Watchtower was in order. This started with a quick look at a plaque placed just in front of it.<br />
Built in the early 1930&#8217;s, the Watchtower had been designed by early tour operators to provide an excellent view of the Grand Canyon. The Watchtower was built from rocks local to the area, and from nearby trees. The Watchtower was built in two parts: the base section and the tower itself. The construction of the base was similar in nature to the ceremonial pits we had seen at Mesa Verde earlier in the day &#8212; circular in formation, with long wood logs creating short arcs around the walls forming a partial dome upon which the roof was constructed.<br />
The room was almost perfectly circular, except for the side the tower was attached to. There the circle had a squarish protrusion. The base functioned almost entirely as a gift shop. The majority of the items in the store were much more appropriate for such a venue, not at all like the things at the gift shop at the parking lot. The squarish protrusion contained mostly t-shirts.<br />
The tower was accessed by a set of curving stairs from the base, guarded by a turnstile that cost a quarter to use. Unlike the phones in Colorado Springs, the turnstile took a Canadian quarter, which unfortunately was the only quarter I had at the time. (I swear it!)<br />
These stairs took you to the first level of the tower which contained a circular display case in the middle, and a Native Indian fresco on the wall opposite to the stairway leading to the base. Near the stairway was a door that led to an observation level on the base&#8217;s roof. The fresco was mostly red and brown with some white. Dhar and I took pictures of the fresco, but due to misreading my light levels, my picture of the fresco was far too dark.<br />
Another staircase led you up to the second level of the tower, which contained only a couple benches and some small windows. This level was essentially a ring around the inside of the tower, the centre looked down into the first level of the tower. Another set of stairs led to the third and last level of the tower.<br />
The windows on the third level were much more open to viewing than the ones on lower levels. Coin-operated telescopes allowed a more close-up view of parts of the canyon. Signs on the wall gave instructions to camera users on how to obtain zoom shots with the use of the canyons. Dhar fed a quarter into one of the telescopes and immediately decided that using the telescope as a zoom lens was not a good idea. I concluded the same after a quick peek.<br />
To this point in the trip, I had not succumbed to any tourist purchases except for the postcards. But one of the shirts on sale in the squarish protrusion in the base appealed to me. It was a dark olive colour with faint Navajo patterns. On the left breast was a small gold phoenix with the words &#8220;Grand Canyon&#8221; under the logo. I also took the opportunity to buy more film. I had meant to buy some earlier in the day, when we were at Mesa Verde, but the prices there had been completely outrageous. On future trips, I&#8217;m buying all my film in advance&#8230;<br />
I coaxed the others to proceed further down the road to another point about ten miles away so I could get a different view of the Canyon. Unfortunately, time wasn&#8217;t on our side and in a few minutes we would be without enough sunlight for my panoramic camera to work properly. Disposable cameras are fun and easy to use &#8230; but only when there&#8217;s bright sunlight around.<br />
Like the rest of Route 64, the road was usually bordered by trees on either side within the park, a calming kind of scenery. Yet the experience of driving down the side of a huge gash in the ground bordered by lush trees in the middle of a desert, listening to the Bee Gee&#8217;s &#8220;Stayin&#8217; Alive&#8221; was enough to strike a feeling of insanity in the sanest of people. Of course, I&#8217;m not about to vouch for the sanity of Dhar, Rebecca, or Stefan &#8212; I already know I was a lost cause.<br />
By the time we reached the next point, sunlight was questionable. Nevertheless I took the opportunity to try and take a couple pictures. I wandered around the guardrails (as many people frequently did) and went down about 80 feet into the canyon. From there I had an unobstructed view of the gorge&#8217;s walls. It was to be the last picture I would take, as the light levels quickly shrank away after that. Several people from Spain or Portugal (I couldn&#8217;t quite tell which) continued to take pictures of their group as I proceeded back up to the main tourist landing.<br />
There I found another sign, containing the history of a hotel that had once been in service in the park. On the opposite side was the history of a copper mine that had flourished for a brief period on the canyon floor. Both were built prior to the Depression, which quickly put an end to both ventures despite the popularity and profitability.<br />
The sun was disappearing fast, but our hunger was not. I hadn&#8217;t eaten since that morning (and even then I think all I ate was an orange), and Stefan&#8217;s lunch hadn&#8217;t kept him full for long. On a suggestion (from someone) we decided to stop at the Park&#8217;s picnic area and make our dinner. We had been keeping our chicken breasts thawed for just such an occasion. That night we would feast upon fajitas, vacation-style.<br />
We drove further west along the road until we reached the park headquarters where the campgrounds were located. Here Highway 180 started and joined with Route 64 (less formally known as the park road), beginning its trip south towards I-40, our eventual destination.<br />
We pulled into a spot and set about digging out the barbeque and propane tank. The signs indicated that we were only allowed to cook at the fireplaces provided. But the fireplaces required charcoal, which we didn&#8217;t have. I assumed the signs were to prevent campfires, but decided to avoid a nasty situation and placed the barbeque on top of the fireplace grill. It was a bit of an awkward fit, but it worked.<br />
About that point another van arrived in the parking lot. It was our mysterious friend from Alberta. I stood beside myself for a moment, wondering at the odds that we would see the same van twice in the same day, almost 300 miles from place to place. The temptation to wander over and meet our fellow countrymen was overwhelming. Hunger, however, won.<br />
By the time the green peppers halves and the chicken hit the grille, the sun had effectively set and darkness set in. The fact that we were eating in a forest didn&#8217;t help matters any &#8212; what little light that was left didn&#8217;t diffuse through the trees easily. Camp candles refused to stay lit for long in the night breeze no matter how much we tried to shield and re-light them.<br />
This caused a minor problem at the picnic table &#8212; we couldn&#8217;t see what we were eating. Before we had left home, my father had suggested that we take a flashlight. My mother had suggested that we take a huge camping light that used one of those heavy 12 volt batteries. I suggested the Snakelight instead. Black &amp; Decker can make a pretty good product, and the Snakelight is one of them. It&#8217;s not very powerful, you don&#8217;t have a bright narrow beam, but when wrapped around the trunk of a thin tree, it provides a dandy glow for having dinner. Black &amp; Decker should talk with MAG and create a hybrid Snakelight / MAG Light. Now there&#8217;s a product!<br />
The fajitas were just what I needed &#8212; I felt a whole lot better once I had finished. By the time I had eaten my last bite, the chicken was chilled and the peppers were polar &#8230; but tasty nonetheless. We then set about the quick task of cleaning up. Unlike several of our evening meals, we actually washed the dishes before leaving. (As the trip drew on, we got into the habit of leaving them out for longer periods of time. Hey &#8212; we were on vacation. Who wants to do housework on vacation?)<br />
Following a stop at the washrooms, we headed out to Highway 180 and began our hour long trip to the I-40. Dhar took control of the wheel, I resumed my position as navigator, Rebecca and Stefan took their place in bed.<br />
On exiting the Grand Canyon National Park, the theme for the trip was finally established through a collective effort: &#8220;Been there, done that &#8230; next!&#8221; This theme was appropriate for many reasons, though the primary one for us was in how the trip was being executed. We were going to some of the most spectacular sights in the Mid and Southwest, stopping briefly, taking in the view, and then heading to the next sight. After a while I started to feel like Chevy Chase in National Lampoon&#8217;s Vacation when he and the family stop briefly at the Grand Canyon on the way to Wally World.<br />
The trip down Highway 180 / Route 64 was uneventful. The view was darker than a black hole, broken only periodically by the piercing headlights of oncoming traffic. Once we exited Kaibab National Forest (which surrounded Grand Canyon National Park on the north and south sides of the Canyon), signs of civilization began to appear, including an IMAX theatre. When Highway 180 veered off to the southeast shortly after exiting the forest, we continued south on Route 64.<br />
Our gas supply was beginning to run low. The van had a tendency to go through the tank at an increasing rate from the time it was filled &#8212; the needle would drop very slowly at first, dropping quicker as the tank emptied. Typically when the tank reached a quarter full, we would start to look for a place to fill up.<br />
We reached Williams, Arizona about a half hour after leaving Highway 180. Gas prices had mysteriously risen to $1.35 a gallon. Until then, we had been paying $1.20 or less for gasoline, and were not exactly in the mood to be paying so much extra. Dhar and I made the decision to continue west along the I-40 to Ash Fork, where we hoped cheaper fuel could be found.<br />
But the gods weren&#8217;t with us that day. In fact, we had finally hit the first signs of bad timing of the entire trip. Unbeknownst to us, gas prices had started to climb dramatically in the United States. In Canada, fluctuations of as much as 10 cents were commonplace, and although a nuisance, were grudgingly accepted. A rise of a mere five cents in America is enough to get politicians voted out of office. Our poor timing was to land in the middle of these price hikes. The further west we traveled, the more expensive the gas became.<br />
We filled up at $1.37, and chose not to argue any further about the price. But even that would get us only as far as Kingman, Arizona before another fill-up would be needed. It was already 20:00, and we had five hours of driving to reach Las Vegas. A late entry to the KOA was going to be unavoidable.<br />
The speed limit across most of the I-40 was 75 miles per hour, a speed that none of us were too comfortable with the Behemoth. Unfortunately, the semi-trucks passing us at 85 miles per hour didn&#8217;t seem to mind so much. Such passings regularly spooked Dhar and I, keeping us awake for quite some time.<br />
Arizona is a sparsely populated state, as is Utah, New Mexico, and Nevada, Arizona&#8217;s neighbouring states. This sparse population leads to one beautiful thing about the night in that area of America &#8212; light pollution is not a concern. Several observatories are built in that area to take advantage of the lack of light. The lack of light also allows one to see lights from a great distance. Even at almost 200 miles distance, we could soon see the bright lights of Las Vegas as a faint glow in the sky. At first I thought it to be a nearby city, but we never passed the glow as we continued westward.<br />
Dhar tired quickly, driving for only an hour and a half before I took over. Rebecca took sole possession of the rear bunk as Stefan came up to join me, forcing Dhar to camp out in the lowered section of the floor (which was coincidentally just long enough for someone to lie down). There were a couple disadvantages to staying there while the Behemoth was in motion &#8212; the friction of the drive shaft caused the floor to become very warm, and the floor wasn&#8217;t sound proofed. Nor was it terribly comfortable.<br />
It was roughly 00:30 when we reached Kingman, the last major city in Arizona before hitting Nevada or California. Just outside of the city we filled up with increasingly expensive gas before making our punch into Nevada. Already the glow of Las Vegas was plain as the moon in a cloudless sky. There was a dusting of clouds that night though, which was the only way we could really see most of the lights. I have to wonder if any resident of Las Vegas has ever seen a starry sky.<br />
We left I-40 for Highway 93, which ran from Kingman directly to the Hoover Dam and Las Vegas. Highway 93 was barren &#8212; no trees and hardly anything to see within 100 metres of the road. But the further we drove up it, the more defined the lights in the sky became. In particular, the lights of the Luxor Grand Hotel and Casino. It was one of the new breed of resort hotels, designed to look like a gigantic pyramid. At the peak was a transparent cap, through which shone a 40 billion candlepower light. (Yes, you read correctly, 40 billion. With a &#8216;b&#8217;.)This light was so bright it could be seen from space on its own. In theory, you could cook a hot dog over it. And a bright spot in the massive glowing mass in the sky indicated where the Luxor lay.<br />
Stefan wanted to see those lights badly. I guess the desire was the result of being such an engineer. I was curious too, mind you &#8212; I had taken apart and assembled enough things in my day to be curious enough to wonder how most things worked. The lights themselves weren&#8217;t a mystery &#8212; how they got so bright was a different story.<br />
But first we had to cross the Hoover Dam. When it was built in the 1930&#8217;s, the dam provided the Arizona and Nevada Governments with something more than electricity &#8212; it provided a bridge across the gorges formed by the Colorado River. Highway 93 became the only road linking the two states, and was the only crossing for over 100 miles in any direction. Highway 93 carried a fair bit of traffic, even at 02:00.<br />
As we rode into the top of the valley, the lights that beamed from the dam announced its presence. At first I didn&#8217;t even recognize it &#8212; all the pictures and films I had seen before were taken during the day. In the valley, the only lights came from the dam itself. There were no spotlights, just a few bright lamps. The walls of the canyon were black, the reservoir was black, both were utterly featureless. As the road bent towards the eastern end of the dam, a small paved area formed to allow cars to stop. Stefan and I pulled out to take a look.<br />
I was mostly interested in a picture. I had wound in the film I had bought at the Grand Canyon, but had neglected to wind it properly. I didn&#8217;t notice this error until after the pictures were developed &#8212; about a quarter of the frame had light exposure damage. But the rest of the time lapse shot gave me a memory of the Hoover Dam at night. Stefan noted that there was a security car parked nearby, the guards watching our every move. For a brief moment I felt like a terrorist planning the ultimate Coup de Gras.<br />
Dhar awoke briefly as we started crossing the dam. He had no idea where we were until we told him that only 20 metres of concrete were preventing a lake from emptying itself and carrying us to certain death. Dhar urged me to drive a bit faster.<br />
Visibility around the site was minimal for that time of night. All we could see were a couple structures: the four intake towers in the reservoir, a parking garage on the Nevada side and a tourist centre across the road from the parking garage. We happily noticed one bonus of crossing the border &#8212; we had another hour to get to Las Vegas, we had entered the Pacific Time Zone, the fourth zone in as many days. It was just after 01:00 Nevada time, and we still had 30 miles to Las Vegas.<br />
The trip up the side of the canyon was slow, I was about as careful as when I had driven up to the Cave of the Winds. The primary difference here was that I couldn&#8217;t see must past the edge of the road. The greatest fear comes from not knowing &#8230; I didn&#8217;t know what (if anything) was down there, and I wasn&#8217;t too much in the mood to find out either.<br />
Soon we were back in a 65 mile an hour zone traveling along Highway 93 towards downtown Las Vegas. The glow in the sky was so large by this point that we couldn&#8217;t tell where it ended. The spotlights from the Luxor were prominent &#8212; the four closely grouped bright spots were impossible to miss. As we rounded large hills, we could barely see the faint beam of light from the Luxor as it rose into the night.<br />
Next thing I knew, we were blinded by a casino. Not just the sign of the casino, but the whole thing. I hadn&#8217;t seen that many lights before in my life in one place. I marveled at the sight. Stefan ho-hummed the casino, warning me that what I had just seen was nothing compared to what lay just beyond the hills surrounding the original &#8220;Sin City&#8221;.<br />
And he wasn&#8217;t kidding. About ten minutes later, we reached the crest of those hills. The bleak black landscape dropped away revealing a glowing, pulsating being of light. The city was alive with itself. It was like nothing I had ever seen before.<br />
In the summer of 1992 I was living in a house in Kanata, just outside of Ottawa. One of the occupants was a kindred student who had come from Acadia University in Nova Scotia to work for the summer. The largest city he had ever seen before was Halifax. With a population of only 115,000 people, Halifax is hardly the city that the Ottawa area creates. (The capital region has in excess of one million residents.) Driving eastward from Kanata along Highway 417 causes you to come over a rise, and at night the entire city and surrounding area glows with lights. My housemate thought the sight was impressive.<br />
Ottawa barely holds a smoldering wick compared to Las Vegas on a foggy night let alone the dry, clear evening we crossed the hills.<br />
Stefan and I immediately pulled the van over to the side of the highway and started rooting through the CD collection. I had planned in advance to bring some music that had the names of some of the places we would be visiting. Although I didn&#8217;t have the original Elvis version of the song, ZZ Top&#8217;s rendition of Viva Las Vegas, played at near-full volume, did as good a job. My skin tingled as we drove down the hill into the ocean of lights.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca had to arise to the occasion, they really didn&#8217;t have much of a choice. The first order of business was finding out where the KOA was in relation to where we were. Stefan was desperate to take a quick tour of The Strip before turning in, and at first I honestly wanted to. But with every mile I kept driving, the more I wanted to stop and go to bed. Everyone else had slept, even if only a little. But I had been up for nearly 17 hours, most of that time on the road, and I was exhausted.<br />
I had to let Stefan down on that. I really didn&#8217;t want to, but I was just too damn tired to really care at that point. We found the exit at Boulder Highway, and started heading south. Almost immediately an enormous sign for the Boulder Station loomed around. It cast so much light I felt the highlights on the Behemoth weren&#8217;t doing much good. About a mile down the road, we found the KOA.<br />
We were justifiably surprised to find a guard booth about 20 metres from the road. Inside were two night guards watching TV and keeping an eye on the goings on about the campground. We pulled up and Stefan hopped out to get the arrangements of the night squared away. Although he actually got to talk with someone who seemed to know what was going on, it still took quite a while to fill out all the vital statistics (including the type of connection we wanted, the number of people in the van, the license plate, the colour, our average weight, height, sexual orientations, what mental state we were in, the amount of money we expected to lose at the casinos, and so forth).<br />
Of all the KOAs we saw, Las Vegas was the most impressive. A large amount of money had been spent to create a beautiful park-like interior with well-paved roads, washrooms every 100 metres on each of the roads, all the amenities that even the most cushy motorhome traveler could need. Palm trees lined the roads, brilliantly coloured fragrant flowers were strategically placed to add to the beauty.<br />
Our slot was right next to one of the washrooms, about 200 metres or so into the campground. Pulling in, I made quick work of hooking us up to the city utilities while the others made quick work of the toilets. It was already about 02:45 in the evening, but we weren&#8217;t anywhere near getting ready to go to bed. Unlike myself, the others were catching their second wind and wanted to see a casino as soon as possible. I contemplated not going and just going to sleep, but I remembered events that I had missed before on previous trips by going to bed &#8230; sleep be damned, I tagged along.<br />
Las Vegas at night was absolutely awesome, to quote Dhar&#8217;s description. It was comfortably warm, the exact temperature at night where if it were one degree warmer or cooler, it wouldn&#8217;t feel right. But here it was perfect. There wasn&#8217;t a cloud in the sky &#8230; nor many stars for that matter &#8212; the city and casino lights were so bright that only the brightest shone through. The wind was but the slightest breeze, enough to remind me of some of my excursions to Florida in years past. Despite my exhaustion, it was too nice a night to sleep.<br />
We wandered back out to Boulder Highway, which wasn&#8217;t a highway at all, just a large four-lane road, and walked about a half-mile or so to the Boulder Station. Even from the KOA driveway the sign was clearly visible, scrolling texts and all. The lights from the sign were almost as bright as day, taking pictures of it was a dead-easy task.<br />
Rebecca turned towards the casino&#8217;s entrance wanting to see more. Remembering an episode of How&#8217;d They Do That? I suddenly realized that my camera could be a problem. Every casino in Las Vegas, or in the world for that matter, had security tighter than most top-secret government agencies. There was simply no way to cheat without the casino management from finding out. Every non-sanctioned device entering the casino could land you in some serious trouble. I saw no reason why my camera would be considered sanctioned.<br />
Apprehension aside, we went in. Immediately we were confronted with slot machines, which probably collectively outnumbered the population of Nevada by a two to one ratio. The tones, tunes, and tings of the machines immediately caused my auditory system to overload, there was simply too much information to process. The experience is like living in a room where the light is always a soft white, then after 20 years you go into a disco. No, even that doesn&#8217;t quite cut it. It&#8217;s more like taking a very prudish, sexually repressed person and dragging them into a live sex show and placing them in the front row seat.<br />
While my body tried to adjust to what I can only describe as culture shock, Dhar and Rebecca immediately sat down to try some video poker and slots. I had gone to Las Vegas with two ideas in mind: 1) Not to gamble at all, or 2) Spend $10 at the dollar slots and see what I could do. That night though, I wasn&#8217;t in any mental condition to do much else than observe the rest lose money.<br />
Correction: I expected them to lose money. It seems however that Dhar has a horseshoe wedged up his ass &#8212; I haven&#8217;t seen someone that lucky in a long time. He would walk up to nickel slot, pop in no more than two nickels, and win at least six more. By the time we left he had increased a single nickel he borrowed from Stefan into about two to three dollars&#8217; worth.<br />
Rebecca wasn&#8217;t quite so lucky. She won a couple times, but the evening overall wasn&#8217;t too successful and she lost money. Stefan took his chances only once or twice, while I stood and watched the casino floor.<br />
Never before had I seen such depravation. At somewhere around 03:00, there were still about a hundred or so people bent on winning money. As De Niro said in the movie Casino: &#8220;The longer you keep &#8217;em, the more they lose.&#8221; When you bet small, as we did, that statement wasn&#8217;t quite true. But the people who were there at 03:00 with their large plastic cups of coins, the heavy smokers sitting around the card tables, and the anxious Keno players weren&#8217;t your average players, they were addicts.<br />
There was a strange film that seemed to cover everything and everyone in that casino. All the employees seemed to have this dazed look about them, the patrons were blind, even the machines and tables looked slightly dingy. And the longer we stayed in there, the more I felt the same scum beginning to form on us.<br />
I thought that the feeling was just the casino, but I soon realized that it was the city. Lasvegasitis &#8230; gamblemania &#8230; autogreedatory response &#8230; call it what you will, the disease is unmistakable and it afflicts everyone in time. The first symptom is a slight aversion to the atmosphere of Las Vegas. The second symptom is the most dangerous: acceptance. The third is a desire to gamble, and is the most subtle of the symptoms. Without treatment, this often leads to the full-blown virus that causes you to lose sense of time, and your money.<br />
This was our first exposure, and we fortunately decided to cut it short before we got totally hooked. We continued to wander about the casino until we found a Dunkin&#8217; Donuts shop that was still open. I guess the die-hard gambler needs a caffeine and sugar fix every so often. The others stocked up on coffee and sweets while I watched. My body was sending me signals ordering me to bed. Eating a donut at the time would&#8217;ve caused a revolt that I wasn&#8217;t in the mood for at the time.<br />
Finishing the repast, we headed for the casino door and emerged into the comforting night. We crossed the immense parking lot surrounding the establishment, watching the security vehicles do their rounds. Reaching a gas station, Stefan and Dhar starting looking for the &#8220;magazines&#8221;. There were none to be found that night.<br />
The last time Stefan had been to Las Vegas, he had seen a magazine that advertised all the prostitutes in the area. I&#8217;m an open-minded person, but when I heard about this I was a little shocked. I think that strip bars are degrading towards women, and you don&#8217;t want to know what I think of prostitution. The fact that Nevada had no laws against it was a curiousity to me, but the existence of such a magazine was nothing short of exploitation.<br />
Upon returning to the van, the Captain Morgan&#8217;s came out of hiding. The only mixed drink I have ever had was a pseudo-screwdriver make with Five-Alive instead of orange juice. At the time I was already rather inebriated and really didn&#8217;t care what I was drinking. Here I was just too damn tired to do anything, let alone drink. The last of the Coke disappeared that night.<br />
We sat out at the picnic table next to our van and began to talk about anything that came to mind. But no matter how hard I tried to concentrate, my mind kept wandering to thoughts of slumber. After ten minutes I gave up on the struggle and announced I was going to bed.<br />
Although the night was warm, sleeping in a sleeping bag would&#8217;ve been too warm. The 110 volt air conditioner received its first trial that evening. I barely managed to get a log entry in before falling asleep.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Second Supplementary</strong><br />
I have seen the face of depraved greed and despair. Thy name is Las Vegas. Inspiring as it was to arrive with ZZ Top blaring, nothing could prepare me for what I saw, or what I&#8217;ll soon see.

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Dawn arrives early at high altitudes, but we didn&#8217;t notice until around 09:00 that morning. Dawn also arrives very cold. When we went to bed, the temperature was something in the neighbourhood of 10 degrees Celsius. Not terribly warm, but when you&#8217;ve been having cold temperatures for six months, 10 degrees is not too bad. When we woke up the next morning, the temperature was somewhere close to zero.<br />
I woke after Dhar. I don&#8217;t know how long he had been up, but no sooner than I had opened my eyes that he was looking back. Both Stefan and Rebecca were asleep, showing no signs of immediate arousal. I raised the window curtain next to me and peered out into the early Colorado morning. The clouds that had shrouded Pikes Peak the previous day were gone, the sky was a perfection of blue. The sun cast long shadows but shone directly on the front of the van, lighting the interior.<br />
Immediately I noticed the cold. I hadn&#8217;t felt this since I had last gone camping. It was a damp cold too, mostly from the condensation inside the van. Most of the ceiling and windows were covered with large beads of water. I wondered if it was from humid air that we had somehow brought with us (not too likely considering how often the windows were open), or from our breathing. Either way, there was about a litre of moisture on the walls.<br />
A rustling of the sheets behind me and a few mumbled words indicated that at least one of our two remaining sleepers was beginning the agonizing stages of waking up. As it turned out we placed the two worst morning people together &#8212; a marriage of convenience, if you will. Both Stefan and Rebecca take forever to get up in the morning, though Rebecca is about a hundred times worse than her other half. The irony was Rebecca continually complained of Stefan&#8217;s lack of motion in the morning, yet he was always up before her.<br />
Dhar and I took this sign as an opportunity to draw all the curtains and go outside and see what morning in the Rockies felt like. I could hear mumbled protests from in and under sleeping bags and pillows about not only the noise, but the sudden increase in the light level.<br />
Colorado Springs is the only place I have ever been that had crisp air that wasn&#8217;t in the middle of winter. Normally, that crisp feeling only comes at some God-awful point in the winter when it&#8217;s so cold your nostril hairs freeze when you breathe through your nose. Except for the temperature and the frozen nostril hairs, Colorado Springs had that same feeling when you breathed.<br />
I smiled to myself, a remnant of a much earlier trip. When I had gone to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1989, Keith Black, the tour group leader, had continually said: &#8220;Smile, you&#8217;re in a different country.&#8221; (See [[Behind the Iron Curtain: My Trip to the Soviet Union, Introduction|My Trip to the Soviet Union]]) The United States is old news for a Canadian living so near to the border and has visited a few states. But nothing I had seen or experienced before prepared me for the sights of the Midwest. I smiled because for the first time, I really knew what Keith Black had meant.<br />
I had noticed Fountain Creek when we had arrived the night before, but hadn&#8217;t really bothered to take a look at it. The creek bed lay about 100 feet directly in front of the van, just to the east of where we were. The creek was low, and might even run dry during the summer months. The winter run-off had already come and gone, as the washed back grasses and debris testified to. The creek couldn&#8217;t have been more than a foot deep, but was probably only a couple degrees above freezing.<br />
Suddenly to my left, I saw something move. Looking over, I saw a medium-sized cat. At first I thought it was a wild cat, considering how it had lurched when I arrived. But when I got a good look at it, I realized that it had been a tourist&#8217;s cat that had gone feral.<br />
I was reminded of a book I had read, Tony Hillerman&#8217;s Skinwalkers. It&#8217;s a story of Navajo Tribal Policemen trying to solve a bizarre string of murders &#8230; a fairly typical plot idea. One of the main characters keeps a sort of watch over a feral cat that moves into a shelter near his trailer. Hillerman described the cat in a very specific way: under-nourished; looking like it had been well-bred; and very wild looking, like it was relying on its wits for survival.<br />
The cat before me was a domestic breed, but not a pure bred. It was definitely not a wild cat. Not yet. How long it had been in the wild I couldn&#8217;t tell &#8212; it was either a quick learner or a very good hunter. Either way, the cat seemed much better off than its literary cousin. It shared the same wild look in its eyes, which shone brighter than the sun. I know house cats, this cat was now closer to being a puma than a pussy.<br />
When I got back Stefan had finally pulled himself out of the bed, and was finding all the stuff he needed to have a shower. I decided to follow suit. I quickly realized however that my towel was still very damp from the night before (it really hadn&#8217;t dried during the night, which may also explain all the condensation on the walls and ceiling). Having a shower would obviously make me feel better, but I would have no way of drying myself off. Rebecca mumbled a nearly coherent idea about the hand dryers in the washrooms.<br />
I collected my toiletries and followed Dhar over to the washrooms. Alas, a hand dryer was nowhere to be found. I sighed and returned to the van, accidentally forgetting my shampoo on the counter. Stefan was entering the bathroom just as I left. When I got back, the doors were locked. My initial thought was that Stefan and Rebecca had locked themselves in. As it happened, Stefan had locked the door leaving Rebecca behind while he showered.<br />
Rebecca was still in bed when I knocked on a side window and announced that whatever it was that Stefan and Rebecca were doing would have to wait. When Rebecca opened the door, she gave me a bit of an odd look. I attributed it to her not quite hearing what I had said, and her general lack of alertness (Rebecca was not a morning person, especially without a large cup of coffee within arm&#8217;s reach). Rebecca promptly turned around, walked back to the rear of the van and buried herself in the sleeping bags, mumbling something about never waking up again.<br />
When Stefan returned, he looked much like a drowned rat who had tried to dry off by shaking the water from its fur. I don&#8217;t know how Stefan always managed to look like that, but I&#8217;ll give him one thing: he was consistent. He immediately apologized for forgetting that he had locked the van when he left. Rebecca grabbed her things and the infamous &#8220;purple bag&#8221; of toiletries from Stefan, and left to do her thing in the washroom. Dhar arrived a moment later and handed me a large beige bottle of Pantene shampoo. I mentally kicked myself in the rear for forgetting it.<br />
Having some of the Behemoth&#8217;s members back gave me the opportunity to give a quick call home. I hadn&#8217;t wanted to do so during the day, considering how much it would cost, but I knew full well that it would be rather difficult to coordinate my times with my parents. They didn&#8217;t like anyone calling after 22:00, so I chose the lesser of two evils and would call at 09:00 &#8230; 11:00 their time.<br />
I wandered over to the pay phone at the back of the KOA office, carrying my daily planner (which, as you&#8217;ll remember from two chapters ago, was doubling as our expenses log during the trip &#8230; not that this particular detail is of any use on this particular occasion) so I could jot down my medical insurance number in case my mother had managed to find it. Taking a suggestion from Stefan, I used the 1-800-Collect(r) service to get through to home. I found it not only a lot easier to use than the system I had used the day before (all I had to do was key in my home number), but also a lot faster to connect.<br />
This time my mother wasn&#8217;t panicky when she picked up the phone. This was probably because I told her I would call when I got to Colorado. It wasn&#8217;t entirely true, I had to call her sometime later, but I was keeping with my word. She hadn&#8217;t found my insurance number. This wasn&#8217;t surprising considering the condition of my room when I left (which, as my mother would often comment, befitting of the local waste disposal site). She asked me the typical questions: &#8220;How are you?&#8221;, &#8220;What are you eating?&#8221;, &#8220;Did you sleep well?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you wearing clean underwear?&#8221;<br />
I kept the conversation short for two reasons: 1) It was expensive calling long distance from the States during the day, even if 1-800-Collect(r) said you could save up to 40% on the call (shameless plug); and 2) My mother&#8217;s questions always annoyed the hell out of me. Hanging up, I walked around to the front of the office to buy postcards.<br />
KOAs make life very simple: everything you need is at arm&#8217;s reach &#8230; though not quite so literally. All of them carried postcards and stamps, although the staff wasn&#8217;t always on the ball with how much postage cost. Normally 40 cents (American), I was first quoted 20 cents in Colorado Springs, and 50 cents when we hit Albuquerque.<br />
The clerk at the desk was the same one we had dealt with the night before. I bid her a good morning as I set about the task of selecting appropriate postcards. At first I was going to buy five cards every place we stayed, one for my parents and one for my close friends at home: Scott, Tara, Chris and Kathryn. But as I quickly learned, many of the places we stayed (including the KOA) had the ol&#8217; four-for-a-buck deal. Now I don&#8217;t want to sound cheap, but saving money on postcards was a blessing, since I sent over $20 (American) of postcards and stamps home. Scott and Tara (who were seeing each other &#8230; and still are) were lumped together.<br />
I chose pictures of Garden of the Gods, Pikes Peak, miscellaneous mountains, and the tackiest postcard I could find. Scott had challenged me to send him all the tacky (or as he had said, &#8220;cheesy&#8221;) postcards to him that I could find. This proved to be a huge challenge, since for some reason good-looking postcards had become more popular than the bad ones.<br />
Having chosen my cards, I asked the clerk for postage. At the time I had no idea of how much postage to get. Unfortunately, neither did the clerk. But she said that 20 cents would get me just about anywhere, so I bought four 20 cents stamps. I filed the stamps and postcards in my organizer so I wouldn&#8217;t lose them and promptly started to head back to the van. Just as I was leaving, I thought to see if a postbox was nearby. The clerk indicated a small stand-up box just outside the door.<br />
Rebecca, Stefan and Dhar were sitting at the picnic table next to the van, poring over the maps we had, and arguing about where we would be going next. Stefan&#8217;s desire to stay in Colorado and travel about the different canyons and natural sights was being shot down by both Rebecca and Dhar. (No, Stefan hadn&#8217;t relented from the argument we all engaged in two days earlier.) I decided it wasn&#8217;t necessary for me to put a word in since my goals were being met through the dual attack. After only a minute or two, Stefan finally gave up and capitulated to figuring out where we were to go next.<br />
The TripTik provided by CAA was promptly pitched on a shelf &#8212; we were going to do the route the way we wanted to do it. Actually, the way they wanted to do it. I personally wanted to follow the TripTik because it would save us time in getting to our destination, which I assumed to be Las Vegas. I hadn&#8217;t yet shaken my habit of efficiency and punctuality.<br />
This was a problem for me, I loved efficiency. If there&#8217;s one thing I really couldn&#8217;t stand, it was wasting time driving the long way to a place. When I planned road trips, it was using a modified MST, a computer term for Minimum Spanning Tree. In plain English, this is the shortest combined distance (or measure) along a given series of points. In our case, the overall shortest distance meant we would first go to Las Vegas, then hit the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon. That was by my methods.<br />
I will be the first to point out that my methods aren&#8217;t always the best ones. And this was just such an example. The route according to the TripTik was to go south on Highway 115 to Highway 50, where we would travel almost due west until we reached Grand Junction, where we would pick up I-70. This would take us to I-15, which would take us directly to Las Vegas. But in doing so, we would have missed some of the most spectacular scenery I have ever seen. At some point in your life, you need to stop and smell the roses, or you miss living. The roses were especially sweet that day.<br />
So Stefan got at least part of his wish, which was to take a scenic route through the Rockies to Cortez, Colorado. There we would spend the night before heading to the Grand Canyon. But more on that when I get to it.<br />
Before we would leave, we decided that we should see something of Colorado Springs. The two principle things on our list were the Cave of the Winds and Pikes Peak. According to the AAA Colorado TourBook, Pikes Peak ran a Cog Railway to the top, but only in good weather. The Cave of the Winds was supposedly open all year long, but in any case I wanted to check. While the others continued to bicker over what roads we were going to take, I headed over to the phone.<br />
Interesting Fact: American phones don&#8217;t take Canadian quarters. Americans in general tend to dislike Canadian change. We found this out a few times when we accidentally (honestly!) mixed a couple Canadian pennies in with our American change. This (luckily) never happened to me, but Dhar and Rebecca both were scolded for &#8220;attempting to cheat&#8221; a retailer. I, purely out of curiousity, wanted to see if a Canadian quarter would work.<br />
According to the receptionist at Pikes Peak, the cog railway had not run the 09:00 run due to snow on the tracks. The receptionist didn&#8217;t know if the 13:00 train would run for the same reason, but suggested I call back at 12:00 to find out. This unfortunately ruled a trip to the top of Pikes Peak out because we simply didn&#8217;t have the time, at least in my humble opinion. Cave of the Winds was open, and all tours were running normally at regular intervals.<br />
I relayed this information to my comrades, who were still in disagreement about the routes. (For the record, this was the only time we had a real debate about which way we would go. For some reason, the rest of the United States was not a point of contention.) Stefan was dead set on the scenic route. I was more for the more direct approach, but agreed that the scenic route was a possibility provided we had the time to drive it. Then Dhar and Rebecca gave in and agreed to the deal. The majority won. I lost. Stefan smiled broadly &#8212; he finally got something to go his way for a change.<br />
We began the procedure of packing up. I went around to the driver&#8217;s side of the van to disconnect the hose and electrical cord. I quickly realized that someone had turned the water off in the night, assumedly to prevent hoses from bursting &#8212; a wise precaution. Following my father&#8217;s instructions, I blew any extra water out of the hoses, coiled the hose and connected the ends together to prevent any dirt or bugs from collecting inside. I also put away the propane tank, having found that it resealed itself during the night. At first I thought it might have been due to the cold, but I had let it sit in the sun for about an hour, and no further leakage appeared.<br />
Following another of my father&#8217;s instructions, I checked the van&#8217;s oil and engine coolant. My father is a stickler for things like that, particularly when cars are involved. My father does most of the maintenance on our vehicles, and in a way he expects me to be like him. But I&#8217;m not &#8212; I work on computers, not cars. I actually prefer biking whenever possible.<br />
The van roared to life minutes later. My father drilled into our family to always let a car engine warm up before going anywhere, just to make sure there&#8217;s no strain on the engine&#8217;s parts. While the engine warmed, we filled several left over two litre plastic Coke bottles so we would have an ample water supply. Stefan warned us that we would dehydrate quickly at the altitudes we would be traveling at. I, for one, was not willing to take risks like that.<br />
I took first shift driving, and our first stop was the pump station. Although we never used our toilet, the washing of the dishes, my brushing my teeth, and the general use of the sink faucet had collected a lot of water in the gray water tank, which I wanted to dump before gallivanting around the Rockies. Rebecca and Stefan headed to the KOA office to get postcards and whatnot, Dhar stuck around to watch.<br />
Pumping stations are usually fairly simple things: a hole in the ground (into a holding tank) with a water hose to wash any spillage. The smell is absolutely atrocious. If you&#8217;ve ever used an outhouse, imagine a smell 100 times worse. I never want to know about the things that end up in a holding tank.<br />
Under the driver door is a running board step. This step is hinged and flips up to reveal the van&#8217;s propane tank with its valve, and the sewage hose with the tank valve handles. Unscrewing a small cap and pulling back a metal plate releases the hose from its tube, pulling out to a distance of about ten feet. But since I parked right next to the holding tank cover, I needed only a couple feet. I pulled back on the handles and dumped our dirty water.<br />
Stefan and Rebecca were still milling around inside the office when we got there. Dhar and I went in to see what they were doing. I took the opportunity to purchase another four twenty cent stamps to correct the oversight on my postcards.<br />
I dropped the postcards in the drop box on our way out, boarded the van, and prepared to head back up I-25 to Cave of the Winds. The trip back was a little on the convoluted side, with all the off-ramps and road construction, but soon we found Highway 24 and started heading west. Unlike the day before, we didn&#8217;t cross over to Colorado Avenue, since we would have had to remerge onto Highway 24 further down.<br />
After a little while we found the exit for Cave of the Winds. It was in fact, a set of stoplights. We turned right and started heading up a road up the side of a mountain. A sign at the entrance told us to ask for assistance if we were driving a large vehicle. However the booths at the base of the mountain, where the help was supposed to be, were vacant. I sighed to myself, shifted into a lower gear, and prepared to see if I could keep ourselves from sliding off the road into a fiery death.<br />
The incline of the road varied but was at least a 6% grade, probably extending into the double digits in a few places. The road was narrow too, so I had to be extra specially careful when going around corners to make sure I didn&#8217;t fall off the edge. To top it all off, the road zig-zagged its way up the side of the mountain. It made Lombard Street in San Francisco look like a straight-away.<br />
The others oohed and aahed as I slowly guided our way up. I kept my eyes glued firmly to the road, not wanting to be distracted by a damn thing. Only once did I have to pass a car coming down, and for that I was thankful. I once caught a glimpse of the edge of the road, and frankly, it scared the hell out of me.<br />
When we reached the top, we drove around to a pull-through parking spot and climbed out. We weren&#8217;t too sure what we should wear inside, but I took the precaution and wore my shoes. Caves tend to keep a constant temperature, and it&#8217;s usually cooler than on the surface. Rebecca and Stefan wore sandals. Dhar would wear shoes until Las Vegas, and would hardly ever take off his jeans.<br />
The view from up there was amazing, but a neighbouring ridge blocked our view of Colorado Springs. I snapped off a few shots of the camera before we headed towards the Cave&#8217;s entrance. Along the way we found the grandstands used for the laser light show, something we were two weeks too early to see, and a miniature replica of an old-West saloon for kids to crawl through.<br />
The Cave entrance was a building built on the side of the mountain. On its main level was a lounge, containing flyers for other attractions, a love tester, and a black hole simulator for coins. Any good tourist trap needs to have a black hole simulator. Below the lounge was an arcade which according to Stefan had an old Zaxxon video game machine. Across from the building&#8217;s entrance was the gift shop, were we would get our tickets for the trip.<br />
We would be a part of tour 13. Lucky us. The shop was heavily unpopulated, containing a small handful of tourists, almost as many clerks, and a couple repairmen getting the store ready for tourist season. I guesses that tourist season had not opened yet. (Be vewy, vewy quiet. We&#8217;re hunting tourists. Hehehehehehe.)<br />
We opted for the Discovery Tour, a 40 minute quickie of the Caves. Also available was the Lantern Tour, which was slightly longer than our tour and performed completely with dimly lit lanterns; and the Wild Tour, a 6 hour trek through the mud and muck that makes up the harder to access parts of the cave. Ours was the cheapest, the quickest, and probably the cleanest (the brochures recommended that you wear coveralls and bring a change of clothes if you take the Wild Tour).<br />
We had to wait about 15 minutes before our tour left. This gave us time (perhaps too much) to wander about the store and see what there was. We found all sorts of tacky tourist souvenirs, including a series of cedar hand paddles with cute comments such as &#8220;Attitude Adjuster&#8221; and &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Little Helper&#8221;. I found an interesting law framed on one of the walls. Desecrating the cave (that is, breaking any of the natural formations or writing on the walls) resulted in a $500 fine and a potential 30 days in jail. I read the particulars, but nearly choked when I read that the law had been written in the mid-1800&#8217;s. That law was still in effect.<br />
Slightly below the legal notice was something I had considered a relic of times past: a sign indicating a fallout shelter. I had to point this out to (I believe it was) Stefan, remarking that the idea seemed a bit absurd. I was referring to the use of the sign at all, not the fact that the cave was a designated shelter. Stefan seemed to misinterpret my meaning, and replied that a cave would be an ideal shelter. This I never doubted, but the fact that the sign still existed was both curious and worrisome.<br />
Dhar and Rebecca both bought lollipops. Nothing in that action was overly interesting, only that the lollipops were all-natural and hand-made. Rebecca&#8217;s was a chocolate and peanut butter flavour, one that I must admit is unusual. Rebecca, originally enthralled with the idea, quickly found that the flavour was none too inviting.<br />
When the boarding call came we proceeded to a door on the north side of the gift shop, next to the frame that held the law. We handed over the little plastic tour tickets to the attendant then walked out to a small porch. There we waited until the tour guide appeared. He looked young, probably in his mid-20&#8217;s or so, and strongly built &#8212; this guide either worked out a lot, or did far too much spelunking for his own good.<br />
He gave us a quick run down of the rules, mostly involving desecration of the cave. A couple words about chewing gum, and then he noticed Dhar and Rebecca sucking on their lollipops. They too were a no-no (the lollipops, not my compatriots), and were quickly tucked away in bags wrapped in waxed paper.<br />
The entrance to the cave was through a short tunnel apparently dug out of the side of the mountain to allow for easier access to tourists. The original cave entrance, used by the two boys who discovered it, was further down the side of the mountain and much harder to use.<br />
The cave was not at all what I expected. Most of my knowledge of caves came from the pages of National Geographic, television documentaries, and whatever books I happened to read. (And people wonder when I describe myself as a nerd &#8230; go figure!) All of them depicted rock or dirt floors, lots of running water, stalactites and stalagmites, crystal formations, and little unnatural lighting. In other words, caves that had seen little of mankind. Cave of the Winds was a commercial cave, not run by the U.S. Park Service. It was &#8220;improved&#8221; to make it more accessible to tourists.<br />
The first stop was less than 20 feet into the cave, where the tour operators had a camera set up to take pictures of the tour members. Almost everyone on the tour were couples, except for a single elderly man (whose wife didn&#8217;t want to go into the cave), a couple with their toddler, and our group of four. In all there were about fifteen people in the tour group. The picture was nothing special, we were officially known as Group 13D, and would see our picture when we got out. This I found rather interesting since I knew that it would take nearly 30 minutes just to develop the film. The 8.5 x 11 pictures would take almost as long (under normal circumstances), and the tour was only about 45 minutes. (One of the advantages of having worked at a Black&#8217;s Camera shop is you pick up these things &#8212; the absolute fastest we could develop film was 45 minutes.)<br />
The first point of the actual tour was a large room about 100 feet long, about 40 wide and sloping from about 10 to 40 feet high. Here we were shown the original entrance, since barred over to prevent people getting stuck or lost. Also here was a time capsule, to be opened around the year 2080. The tour guide invited one and all to come back to witness its contents. We happily laughed at an otherwise lame joke.<br />
And so we walked down the concrete pathways with their aluminum, brass, and iron railings; up the concrete steps; marveled at the coloured lights that shone on the broken cave formations. I actually felt sorry for the cave, having to put up with humans continually wandering through, leaving behind their mark. I&#8217;m not a rabid environmentalist, but I&#8217;m not for destroying the world. As a camper, I strongly believe in leaving things as they were found, leaving nothing behind. I would have been much happier seeing the cave with lanterns, knowing how little of it had been changed.<br />
The Cave of the Winds holds the record for America&#8217;s highest commercial cave. I assumed that means that there are other caves higher than Cave of the Winds that are protected by the U.S. Park Service, but chose not to clarify the tour guide&#8217;s statements.<br />
Some parts of the cave were interesting. On one of the ceilings were a series of cave flowers, which are crystal formations that grow out like flowers. To prevent people from trying to pick them, the tour operators covered the flowers with wire mesh. Albeit ugly, the mesh kept the flowers for all to see, at least what was left of them. Many of the flowers were visibly broken or altogether missing.<br />
Fat Man&#8217;s Misery / Tall Man&#8217;s Agony was a rather interesting place to visit. It was so named due to its low ceiling (requiring tall people to almost have to walk through on all fours) and its narrow width. Only children could enter the passage without having to bend or crouch. I couldn&#8217;t help but call out &#8220;Everybody limbo!&#8221; like a boisterous Ricardo Montalban as I entered the passage.<br />
The Cave of the Winds, despite its name, was formed mostly through water pressure. Many caves (such as Mammoth Cave) are formed through water erosion, which although similar in nature, is still different. Natural erosion takes place over hundreds of thousands of years; water dripping and seeping through cracks eventually opens chambers. Under water pressure, the sheer force of water eroded the cave, most likely in a shorter span of time. When Cave of the Winds was formed, it was much closer to sea level than it is now. Many parts of the cave showed this erosion through pressure, the swirls and indentations of the currents were plain to see.<br />
We exited the cave nearly an hour after entering, leaving the cool 58 degrees Fahrenheit behind and returning to a much warmer 75 degrees. Upon exiting, our pictures were ready. The picture was nothing special, a simple 8.5 x 11 inch photo in a stiff paper frame. I was tempted to ask if we could buy the negative rather than the picture. That notwithstanding, Dhar bought the picture.<br />
We wandered about the gift shop for a few minutes while Dhar got his change from the store. Rebecca took the opportunity to buy some homemade fudge that the store sold. She was a bit confused about the flavour she was buying, since she had never heard of a Heath Bar. In Canada, we know the Heath Bar better as a Skor candy bar. I find the name &#8220;Heath&#8221; a rather interesting one for a candy bar, since the word &#8220;heath&#8221; means &#8220;wasteland&#8221;. (Part of the joys of being an English major.) Incidentally, the fudge was magnificent.<br />
The drive back down the mountain was not quite as nerve-wracking as the trip up, although I&#8217;m not too sure why. This time, I could see down the mountain, and it should have frightened me half to death. Maybe it was that I could see where I was going (the way up was mostly obscured by the cliffs). But the van remained in second gear the whole time to keep it from moving too fast, my foot firmly on the brake.<br />
The next issue was food. Not necessarily lunch, but food from which we could make meals. We opted not to return to Colorado Springs, but continue west on Highway 24 until we found a more appropriate place to buy our nourishment. When we reached Woodland Park about twenty minutes later, Dhar was too hungry to wait any longer.<br />
McDonald&#8217;s is not exactly known for their fine cuisine. In fact, a Big Mac is almost at the bottom of things I would eat when given a choice. But Dhar was in the mood for a McChicken &#8230; or a Filet O&#8217; Fish, one of those dumbly named sandwiches. I wasn&#8217;t too hungry and decided that a couple cheeseburgers would fill the void that was forming in my stomach.<br />
School was out for lunch. Everywhere I looked were high school students, and most of them looked rather undeveloped &#8212; I figured the hamburgers they were eating had higher IQs. As I looked around the establishment, I followed Stefan&#8217;s gaze to a family eating lunch. That in itself wasn&#8217;t so interesting as it was to realize that the family was wearing what appeared to be their Sunday best, and had dragged Grandma along for the ride. I shook my head silently, not understanding how someone could classify Raunchy Ron&#8217;s as good eating.<br />
Mind you, this particular McDonald&#8217;s seemed to be caught in a bit of a time warp (though none quite so severe as the Kansas Interspatial Distortion). On the wall next to the door next to the door we had entered through was a Mac Tonight sign. I suddenly had a flashback to the failed ad campaign McDonald&#8217;s launched in the mid-80&#8217;s to get people to eat at McDonald&#8217;s for dinner. The waning moon-head of the character was oddly disturbing, even more so when I was surrounded by people that some anthropologists might consider throwbacks to the Stone Age.<br />
We didn&#8217;t leave for quite some time, Dhar&#8217;s order took a while. Even when we did leave, we had to come back to retrieve the sandwiches he forgot. What a silly bunt! We continued along Highway 24, now looking for two things: a grocery store and a liquor store. (But you don&#8217;t even know her!) We didn&#8217;t even need to leave Woodland Park to fill that need. Stefan and I waited while Rebecca and Dhar shopped for sustenance. This gave me a chance to finish my lunch.<br />
I can eat a Canadian McDonald&#8217;s cheeseburger regardless of what its temperature is, or when it was made. The cheeseburgers I had just bought were freshly made (I had seen them made), but tasted horrible. American beef has a lot of fat and hormones in it, that is fact. Beyond that, I don&#8217;t know what else it could have been. The meat was like gray mush, there was only one lousy pickle, and the onions had no flavour. It was the worst hamburger &#8230; sorry, cheeseburger that I had ever eaten. It was the last American hamburger I ate during the entire trip.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what Dhar and Rebecca were doing, but they took nearly a half hour to buy a few bags of food. That included cans of corn and green beans, pancake mix, popcorn, tortillas, chicken, hot dog buns, green peppers, orange juice, and my personal favourite: fruit loops. Not the Kellogg version, but some knock-off that was cheaper, but just as high in sugar content.<br />
While Rebecca and I saw to the storing of the food, Dhar and Stefan saw to the purchasing of alcoholic substances: Captain Morgan&#8217;s Spiced Rum, and a large bottle of cheap wine. Neither exactly my flavour.<br />
Stefan guided me out of the parking spot (which had me on an angle pointing down a hill), and out into the driving lane. A few moments later and we were once again heading west on Highway 24. The day was bright, the air was warm, and we had almost seven hours and over 6,000 feet of elevation to traverse before arriving in Cortez later that night. By this time I had accepted the scenic route as the decided course, and on such a day it was not to be a course to be forgotten.<br />
The lack of clouds in the sky, the snowy caps of the mountains, the immense conifer forests became absolutely breathtaking. The roads wound in, around and through the hills and valleys that made up the Rocky mountains and the plains that exist between the ranges. Several times we stopped for pictures and to look at the beauty without the obstruction of the van. It wasn&#8217;t long before we left Highway 24 and started on Highway 50.<br />
Our highest point was Monarch Pass, which we arrived at about two hours after leaving Woodland Park. At 11,312 feet above sea level, both the Behemoth and I were having problems getting a good breath of oxygen. I felt a little light headed. We stopped as we crept up the pass, pulling over to the side for a while to have a brief snowball fight. The last time I had run around in the snow in my shorts had been about three years earlier when I was visiting a friend in Montreal. And this time I wasn&#8217;t even wearing my shoes &#8212; they were tucked away somewhere in the closet, I was wearing my sandals sans socks.<br />
Stefan took over driving from that point. I concentrated on seeing things I had never seen before. Rebecca and Dhar retreated to the back of the van to play cards, as they were very prone to doing. Stefan seemed to get really annoyed at this, he was very enthusiastic about all the nature we were seeing, and all Rebecca and Dhar could do was play cards. I stayed out of the argument, preferring to watch the world pass us by.<br />
Driving down the pass was almost as much fun as driving up. Stefan kept the van in second gear pretty much the whole way down, not wanting to burn out the brakes as we descended. Fortunately, the pass isn&#8217;t widely traveled and traffic was fairly low. The odd semi-trailer would drive it, and we usually passed them going in the opposite direction. Though just as we were exiting, we ran into one.<br />
It didn&#8217;t take Stefan long to get around it, the van having found new life at 9,000 feet, and we quickly found ourselves in the middle of cattle country. Everywhere we looked were cows, steers, and the odd bison. It seemed that it was breeding time too, as one bull on our right quickly told us. Outside of nature documentaries, I had never actually seen animals on the verge of mating. To be honest, I was envious &#8212; animals make it look so easy, they don&#8217;t have to deal with all the bullshit surrounding human relationships.<br />
One bull suddenly started gushing fluids from its groin, and it started to mount one of the cows. Rebecca sounded almost like a giddy schoolgirl witnessing sex for the first time. She shrieked about &#8220;how large it is&#8221;. I had to feel sorry for Stefan, that somewhere he felt he was being compared to an animal whose phallus resembled a metre-long heat seeking moisture missile. (Metaphor intended.)<br />
About halfway along Highway 50, just outside Gunnison, we stopped for pictures at a kind of picnic area. The road into the small park had an interesting feature that I hadn&#8217;t seen before, and that we saw almost continually until we reached Louisiana: a large steel grating made of parallel bars. It ran between the fence posts at either side of the road. I was justifiably curious, not knowing what it was. Stefan was quick to explain that animals, particularly cloven ones, are unable to cross the grating. It saves money as you don&#8217;t have to build or maintain a gate.<br />
The roadway inside the tiny reserve was poor, not likely having been repaired in some time. But the park did have one thing that I found useful &#8212; a Johnny-On-The-Spot. Not exactly the Ritz as far as the smell is concerned, but a welcome relief nonetheless.<br />
The view from the lookout was breathtaking. The lookout was perched right on the edge of a hill, which quickly dropped just below us. Just a few miles ahead was Gunnison, laying part way into a vast plain. Across it were more mountains. I took out the panoramic for another picture, pausing just before taking it when I had a much better idea.<br />
I had Rebecca, Dhar and Stefan position themselves in the middle and at the edges of the viewfinder so that they effectively split the picture in three. As it turned out, the picture looked pretty good (for a disposable camera with a cheap plastic lens), although I found that the viewfinder is a little smaller than the lens&#8217; view when I saw the picture two weeks later.<br />
Just outside Gunnison, on the other side of town, we came across the Blue Mesa reservoir. Somewhere down river, one of the Governments (either State or Federal) had built a dam, creating the reservoir. But this reservoir was strangely depleted. We had arrived at the reservoir just following the spring run-off, during which a reservoir should be filled almost to the limit. Yet the water level was at least 30 feet below what appeared to be the normal water line.<br />
Huge strips of land connected what would normally be islands with the shore. Exposed lake bed glowed a yellowish-brown, marked with a few large rocks every so often. Stefan and I commented to each other repeatedly about the water level, several times trying to get Rebecca and Dhar to express any interest in the phenomenon. But they were too engrossed in their card game to really care too much.<br />
After cross a bridge to the south side of the reservoir, we stopped a little ways down at an interesting mesa hillside visible on the north side of the reservoir. Erosion had cut tall fingers out of the hill, creating a sort of effect of someone having dragged a huge comb through the soil.<br />
About an hour later we reached Montrose, where Highway 50 ended. The sun was beginning to set on us, and I was beginning to have serious doubts of getting to Cortez before 20:00 that evening. A quick calculation proved that the earliest we could get there was at 21:30, well past the KOA&#8217;s office hours. We turned onto Highway 550 for our half-hour trip to Ridgway where we would pick up Route 62, continuing the Scenic Route.<br />
The shadows grew long, hiding all the trees and cliffs. Soon all around us was darkness, and a desperate need to go to the bathroom. Montrose looked deserted when we passed it, so we had to continue in our quest for relief. I suggested we get familiar with the on-board toilet. However, a certain member of our regiment steadfastly insisted she could last.<br />
Soon we reached Route 145, which would take us indirectly to Cortez. I refuse to say &#8220;directly&#8221; because the road weaved in and out of hills and valleys in a huge zig-zag. The first major bend was just outside of Telluride, where we found an open gas station. Although we didn&#8217;t need any fuel, we all needed to relieve ourselves and stock up on liquids and chocolate, the latter being a not-so-good idea.<br />
The moon was out that night, and was very bright. Unfortunately, it was hard to see it amongst all the trees. Dhar took over from Stefan, who took over navigating from me. I perched myself behind Stefan and peered out the windows to try and see anything in the dark. Through rare breaks in the trees I could see valleys, small mountain peaks, and the odd house. Otherwise, it was a series of black blobs.<br />
About 30 miles out of Cortez, we finally hit some excitement. As we came around a corner, we saw the flashing lights of a police car, in this case a Bronco. A cop had set up flares and positioned his car to prevent people from hitting a small landslide that had blocked part of the lane we were driving in. Dhar passed the cop slowly, allowing us to peer out at what we might have hit had the cop not been there to warn us. It was then that I realized just how dangerous that part of the trip had been. A heaving run-off could have dislodged a large rock, taking out the van with a single blow.<br />
The excitement didn&#8217;t end there however. About ten miles later, we caught a glimpse of the clean-up crew racing to the landslide. The first vehicle in line was a dumptruck with a plow on the front. I don&#8217;t know how fast he was going, but he came within a foot of hitting us, enough to make the four of us hold our breaths for a moment, then swear in unison that we weren&#8217;t all killed. Almost right behind the truck was a front-end loader that kept his distance.<br />
Almost as quickly as we entered the mountains, we exited them. Before us were the lights of Cortez, a city of only 7,300, but with enough lights to block out some of the stars in the sky. We pulled over just outside of the forests and gazed up for a few moments. Stefan remarked that Rainy River was much better, having no lights brighter than a 100 watt bulb. We piled back in and kept on driving.<br />
Route 145 ended at Highway 160, which coincidentally enough was where the KOA was located. We turned left, drove about 100 feet, and headed in for a late check-in. Stefan gathered up his wallet, bounded out the door, and went over to be frustrated by the late check-in booth. This was the first time we had ever checked in late, so this was a whole new experience for Stefan.<br />
He stared at the instructions for a few minutes, then came back for a pen he could write with. I never asked Stefan if he knew what on Earth he was doing, I figured he&#8217;d always answer &#8220;yes&#8221; regardless if he did or not. But it always took quite a while to get checked in every night we came in late. I don&#8217;t know if it was a result of him trying to figure out the cost when the discount was figured in or not, but nonetheless it took a while. Eventually, he returned with a map of the camp, indicating where we were to park.<br />
We drove almost all the way around the park before we finally found the right slot. Then we drove around to the other side so we could properly pull through. Once Dhar had us in place, I hopped out with the keys and proceeded to get us hooked up.<br />
Dinner had us in a heated discussion for about ten minutes before deciding on peanut butter and honey sandwiches. None of us were in the mood for cooking, and were all pretty tapped out from all the driving we had done that day. I figured in part the lack of will was due to us not being comfortable at the high altitude. During the day, we had traveled over 10,000 feet vertically (over 5,000 up and another 5,000 down) and all the pressure change had my ears nearly ringing.<br />
To go along with our light meal was the wine Stefan and Dhar had purchased in Woodland Park. Three large plastic cups were partially filled with the cheap spirits, whilst I drank of Coke. I normally don&#8217;t mind wine (at least not since I started drinking at New Year&#8217;s that year), but the kind I prefer starts at $20 a litre. The gallon they bought was around $4.<br />
The sandwiches filled a nutritional void that needed to be filled, we were quite satisfied that we could now go to sleep without a serious argument from our stomachs. Stefan and I were undoubtedly a different situation, but the both of us would agree that even a little food is much better than no food at all. One other advantage with making sandwiches was a minimalist clean up.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Observer&#8217;s Log: Traveldate 960423.227</strong><br />
<em>Day 3</em><br />
This can be easily defined as perhaps one of the most beautiful days in my life.We didn&#8217;t get a chance to get to go up Pikes Peak, the result of finally figuring out what the hell we were doing. We went to the Cave of the Winds, an uphill drive (and downhill) I&#8217;ll not soon forget.<br />
We spent almost as much time on the road as in Kansas, but the sights were much better.<br />
Finally arriving in Cortez, we scarfed down peanut butter sandwiches for &#8220;dinner&#8221; and everyone (sans moi) is getting drunk on cheap wine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was the alcoholic content of the wine, the change in altitude, or the phase of the moon but Rebecca got loony very quickly. By loony, I mean more or less drunk. Being the Observer, I know what drunk people are like &#8230; I&#8217;ve known hundreds, and this year became one of them. So I know drunk. Rebecca was not &#8220;hammered&#8221; or &#8220;blitzed&#8221;, but she was, to take a line from Pink Floyd, comfortably numb.<br />
The wine didn&#8217;t seem to affect Stefan or Dhar much, except the slight redness in Dhar&#8217;s nose, so we concentrated on Rebecca&#8217;s antics. When that got boring (right about when the bottle was emptied), we began talking about whatever came to mind.<br />
Take a set of young adults, give them alcohol, put them in a confined space and 99 times out of 100, they&#8217;ll end up on sex. Not necessarily participate in the act of sex (although that is a possibility), but discussion almost invariably leads to sex. I really have to wonder why psychologists have never studied this. Is it a preoccupation? I know it is with men (being one, I feel I can speak confidently for the whole), but is it with women? I can&#8217;t say Rebecca speaks for the whole of women, since she&#8217;s preoccupied with it for different reasons &#8212; she already has had kids, and is a sex expert in her line of employment.<br />
Nevertheless, we ended up talking about sex. Specifics I cannot recall, since I was not only fairly tired, but the number of such discussions I have had prior and since that night have irreversibly garbled what memory of particulars I had of that evening.<br />
What I do remember of that evening was Dhar&#8217;s silence. Rebecca did most of the talking, Stefan and I accounting for about only half the discussion. It was then that I realized that Dhar was insecure about the subject. At first I thought he was just a kindred spirit to myself &#8212; too shy to ask, too desperate to get it. But his general lack of contribution, even when prompted, told a totally different story. Sex was not quite taboo, but it was something very private to him and not open for discussion at any time. I sympathized with him, having to listen to the three of us babble away while he patiently sat there and waited for us to finish.<br />
Somewhere close to 01:00, we decided that sleep was not a bad idea. The plans for the following day were to visit the Four Corners and the Grand Canyon, getting into Las Vegas sometime around 20:00 that night.<br />
I pulled my bed out as usual, but Dhar decided that he was going to try a different way of sleeping, and simply tilted his chair back. Dhar spent the night sleeping in a reclined seated position, facing the rear of the van. It didn&#8217;t stop him snoring through, he began than less than five minutes after the lights went out&#8230;</p>
