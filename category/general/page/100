		<p>T-minus 3 days<br />
I awoke with my alarm ready for a day of discovery. That was important because I had only met three people in the crew of 30-odd. When I arrived in the restaurant for breakfast, I stared at a seemingly endless sea of unfamiliar faces. I ate breakfast alone, partly because I still have a weird shyness complex, and also because I needed to review my notes. (If anyone asks, I&#8217;m sticking with the latter reason.)<br />
Walking into this entire affair, I&#8217;d had many questions and concerns. I had many reservations. I didn&#8217;t know whom I could rely on for help. Over the last two months, I came to know the management of this project. With that familiarity came comfort that things were under control. Today just reinforced that.<br />
I boarded the shuttle to Pacific Central station, barely knowing a person. I didn&#8217;t even know who my tent-mate was. I had talked to her on the phone, but you really don&#8217;t get an impression for them with a short conversation. We had work to do, and all I could do was just follow the crowd and fill in the blanks as I went along.<br />
The first big help was courtesy of Ivan, the Museum curator. He had made name tags for everyone in the crew so we wouldn&#8217;t have so much trouble with names. (And also so guests would know who were are.) Besides, &#8220;Hi My Name Is&#8221; stickers look a little goofy.<br />
We started off slowly &#8212; there was little we could do until VIA switched our train (or as much of it as was available) into the station so we could start unloading our stuff. Everyone milled. Some people knew others, but many (like myself) were total strangers. I figured out who Daryl was early on &#8212; he had the video camera. Ivan and I met in the opening stages, as well, learning that we were both part of historical rail societies.<br />
This was our first practical introduction to everything we have to work with over the next 37 days. Some of us had attended a meeting in Toronto a couple of weeks earlier that included basics with the tent. I saw a video. So actually getting a chance to fully set the equipment up was not only important, but helpful.<br />
I had never been on VIA&#8217;s Budd cars before. (These are the stainless steel passenger cars most visible on The Canadian.) Formerly of the Canadian Pacific Railway, VIA inherited the cars when taking over passenger service in Canada. As we wandered through the cars, it suddenly became real. This was really happening.<br />
For the last two months, I was living in a bit of a daze. When Brenda had approached me with this project, I felt like someone had a conduit into my dreams. Though I was active in planning and development, I still felt separated. Now I was in the thick of it. These were the people on the train. I would work and live with them for over a month. This was the train. There was no doubt any more, not even a hint of possibility. This was it.<br />
Today was my introduction to the team. I hovered rather than directly introduced, allowing time for acceptance and for adjustment. The team is going to be everything for the next month, and I want to get off on a good start. Besides, I don&#8217;t want to bombard them with the Full Geoff. (Sometimes, I&#8217;m a little much.)<br />
We set up tents in the morning. The original plan was to do full set ups and strikes (taking everything down) as many times as possible so we&#8217;d be comfortable with the system. But an unexpected arrival of the Rocky Mountaineer from Kamloops derailed us, and we had to stop.<br />
During our break, Earl (the director of VIA&#8217;s Vancouver Maintenance Centre) took us into the maintenance building to see our lead locomotive. VIA #6403, a GMD F40PH-2 diesel electric locomotive, sat in its CBC 50th Anniversary decaled glory. It sat proud, looking like a cat that had just finished cleaning itself, ready for petting.<br />
After lunch, we emptied the baggage car and made an attempt to see what we could make of the equipment. I was happy to see that all the computers and monitors had survived the trip. I was ecstatic to see that all the problems I&#8217;d seen in Toronto had been solved. Blake, one of the wunderkinds of the CBC interactive group, had worked magic that even Gandalf would not challenge.<br />
We worked the whole day, at least when we weren&#8217;t halted by a train or by some other activity that needed our attention. Tests, checks, experiments, and finally decisions. When we were done, there was a feeling of accomplishment (though a few people thought we didn&#8217;t do enough), and of confidence.<br />
Packing everything back up was a bigger challenge. Pulling things out of a baggage car is immeasurably easier than trying to get it back in again. Especially when it needs to be in a specific order. We finished around 21:30 that evening. We called it a night, retiring to the hotel for a rest. The day to come was going to be our real test.<br />
Brenda had arrived in the hotel by that time. She had come out to see how her labours were paying off. Brenda had lost countless days of sleep, and probably gained a few grey hairs working out the details for her department. Now it was time to see if it was all worth it.<br />
Running into Neil in the hotel lobby, he invited me to join him, Brenda, and several others at the bar next door for a quick drink. Brenda and I ended up talking shop the entire time. I told her what I knew. She asked more questions. But in the end, the truth wouldn&#8217;t be known until the next day.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 4 days<br />
First order of the day was to move out of Joel and Michelle&#8217;s piano room. Although I greatly appreciate their hospitality, I do need to be with the rest of the CBC. The show starts tomorrow morning.<br />
I dropped the car off at the Budget Rent-A-Car shortly after 9:00. The car was in the same shape I had received it, save for a few extra kilometres on the odometer. I cabbed it from there to the Lougheed Mall Skytrain station on the new Millennium Line (which opened for service yesterday). No sense in not taking a train when the possibility exists.<br />
The trip on the new line would have been better had I been in the new cars, but they&#8217;re not as frequent as the old ones. But a train ride is rarely bad. Arriving at the Commercial stop, I disembarked and boarded an Expo Line train for the Granville station. From there, it was a 10 minute walk down to the Holiday Inn at the corner of Howe and Helmcken.<br />
Holiday Inn was another important partner in the 50th anniversary celebrations with the CBC. They, too, are having their 50th birthday this year, and have supplied the CBC with hotel accommodations across Canada. For free.<br />
This trip gets better each and every day.<br />
I checked in, dumped off my things, and got to my second order of business: a shower. (Lugging all those things around is a fair bit of work.) Then it was time for the third thing I needed to attend to: lunch.<br />
Every time I come to Vancouver, I have lunch with my friends from Radical. When I used to work there, I would listen to them talk about the projects over Chinese food. Now I listen to them talk about projects in code, so I won&#8217;t hear anything important. The code is sometimes so vague they even stump themselves. Inevitably I can piece things together, but I&#8217;m bound by an informal disclosure agreement, not to mention respect, not to talk about it. So don&#8217;t ask.<br />
Following lunch, I bade farewell and headed towards False Creek Ferries. They&#8217;re my favourite means of transportation to Granville Island. (That, and I forgot about the trolley car.) Picture a bathtub roughly twice the normal size, with an inverted-T top. It&#8217;s small, it doesn&#8217;t move very fast, but it&#8217;s a graceful way to move around False Creek.<br />
No matter how long I&#8217;m away from Vancouver, I always try to visit Granville Island. It&#8217;s by far my favourite place in the city. The smells of fresh fruit and vegetables and breads, the taste of fresh fish, the ambiance of a large community market, and the comfort of a friend. It&#8217;s always worth a side trip.<br />
I had wanted to visit my friend Katrina during my False Creek excursion. (For those of you following the program, this is the same Katrina who had moved to California. Since then, she and her husband moved back to Vancouver, much to everyone&#8217;s delight.) Alas, I had forgotten her phone number in Calgary, and her cellular phone wasn&#8217;t on. We connected later in the day, but only by voice. We tried to make plans to get together that night, but Katrina had to pack for her trip east. Sadly, we will not meet again until later.<br />
Dinner was with Lee and her boyfriend Matt. (You might remember Lee as my &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221; from my days with the Rad Sox softball team.) We were later joined by Neall and his girlfriend Mel. We hoped for more, but in the end fewer people make for better conversation.<br />
We started at a somewhat mediocre Indian restaurant just off Denman. My experiences with Indian cuisine on the West Coast are generally positive. This one was neutral. I wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled, but I&#8217;ve had worse. We moved later to the Sylvia Hotel&#8217;s bar. Slightly on the tacky side, it&#8217;s also lightly travelled, and a place to spot the stars.<br />
We would not have a late night. Though tempting, we all had to work the next day. I didn&#8217;t want to be late.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 5 days<br />
Today was supposed to be tourist day. It was supposed to be sunny and warm, with nice little chirping birds and happy people out enjoying the &#8220;last day of summer&#8221;. (School starts tomorrow.)<br />
So naturally, it rained.<br />
Out here in Maple Ridge, it teemed. I hoped that by the time I got to Howe Sound that either the rain had died out, or was reduced to spittle due to the mountains.<br />
To a degree, I was right. But there was one thing I didn&#8217;t count on &#8211; traffic accidents that snarl up the Sea to Sky Highway. That pretty much ended my excursion to Britannia Mines and the West Coast Railway Association. Maybe the next trip out.<br />
The whole highway thing was a little interesting. As I sat in my rented Chrysler Neon (which I can now confidently say is a poor excuse for a car), I thought about the problem. Whistler wants to host the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. That means a lot of people driving to and from Vancouver. As it stands, the Sea to Sky Highway (also known as Highway 99) can&#8217;t handle that traffic. And in winter conditions, the next Olympic demonstration sport will be the Traffic Accident Slalom. There&#8217;s a lot of problems that the BC government will need to solve before the games start.<br />
I ended up in Horseshoe Bay. The only reason was to have Trolls&#8217; fish and chips, which I remembered quite fondly. But it was an off day, a general slump in quality, or my memory of the fish was distorted. I was not impressed. And they appeared to have taken salmon off the menu. Salmon fish and chips was a delicacy I missed.<br />
On the way back, I stopped into Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. The wine shop I had once been to was still there. I bought a thank you for my gracious hosts for the time and place. Besides, it was a great excuse to go wine hunting &#8211; something I never get tired of.<br />
I had dinner with Greg. It&#8217;s almost bizarre how well Greg and I get along considering how little we see of each other. We worked in the same department for a little over two years, but during those years we were more co-workers than friends. It wasn&#8217;t until I asked him for help when I moved to Calgary that things changed. Since then, he&#8217;s been a good, trusted friend.<br />
Tonight, we had more time together than our last few meetings. This allowed for a nice long steak dinner at a local Joey Tomato&#8217;s, and time to catch up on all the things that had come up in our lives over the last year.<br />
Greg&#8217;s always been an active person who strives to keep himself busy. If he&#8217;s not working, he&#8217;s rock climbing, working in the Hungarian community, or more recently, acting. Personally, I think Greg&#8217;s ideally suited to acting &#8230; for his looks, if nothing else. Hollywood stars should be jealous of him. Acting will let him extend himself past the algorithms he works with all day, and into a stronger right-brain skill set.<br />
We saw a movie following dinner (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, which I recommend highly to anyone who&#8217;s had or seen to too many nuptials in the last two years). We laughed. A lot. A part of me wishes we could have just sat down, shared drinks and talked all night. Greg and I can do that easily. But Greg had to work the next day, and I had to move to a hotel.<br />
Tomorrow is my last &#8220;free&#8221; day before the real work begins. I can&#8217;t tell if I&#8217;m excited or terrified.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 6 days<br />
Today was much quieter than the previous two days &#8230; if you don&#8217;t count two kids, that is.<br />
After waking and spending a morning with Joel and Michelle&#8217;s family, Joel showed me his new pet project. Joel is working on an addition to the Microsoft Flight Simulator, called Squawkbox. It allows virtual pilots to communicate using voice (instead of chat) with virtual air traffic controllers. It also links pilots other pilots. The end result is a simulation that is eerily close to the real thing.<br />
Joel even demonstrated the existing system. He prepared his flight from Boston. This required him to talk with the Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) who &#8220;managed&#8221; Boston. There are two such people: Tower control, and Approach control. Although probably not even in the same city, these two people hand off control to each other, just as would happen in real life. For the end user, the experience is nothing short of completely engaging. I can see why Joel gets so excited when he talks about the system.<br />
Following our virtual fly by of Boston, Joel took me to get a car. Joel and Michelle have been most kind to give me a place to stay. However, being so far out of town, it does require me to rent a car (public transit, though preferable, isn&#8217;t really an option). It&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. I actually like having the car. It gives me more freedom.<br />
The primary reason for the car was a local wedding reception for my friend Nigel. He&#8217;s an former coworker from Radical Entertainment (he&#8217;s still there &#8230; I&#8217;m not). Nigel married his wife, Patricia, the day after my sister and in the adjacent town. [Insert singing and dancing dolls here.]<br />
The party was held in Heritage Hall on Main St. in Vancouver. Until I was a couple of blocks away, I didn&#8217;t know the place. But as I turned onto Main St., suddenly I remembered. Nigel&#8217;s theatre group (Tempest in a Teacup) had put on a show in the basement that I&#8217;d seen a few years earlier.<br />
Not many Radicalites were out, but those who did come still work there. I still miss the company, the people, and the excitement. In the last few months, I&#8217;ve been regretting more and more having left. While I really want to go back, I doubt there is little room for me in the organization. It was a really fun place to work, and despite the hurried schedules of releasing game, Radical had an energy that Critical Mass could never hope to have.<br />
Greg and I had a long talk. It had been a long time since we&#8217;d seen each other, and we had much to discuss. (These journals don&#8217;t cover every detail of my life.) We chat very rarely, on account of how busy we are.<br />
Within a couple of hours, most of the people I knew had filtered out. Those who remained were personable, having talked with several of them before the Radicalites arrived. But I was getting tired, and had an hour drive back to Joel&#8217;s.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it out of downtown. I tried to drive towards the east, but the lure of the city lights drew me downtown, and out to Stanley Park. An imposing feature at night (no lights inside the park), the edges offer some of the best shots of Vancouver at night. I was an hour late getting to bed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>T-Minus 7 days<br />
Five-thirty is an unfair time of the morning. Especially if your alarm clock wakes you in the middle of a really good dream.<br />
This morning, I took a taxi to the BC Rail station and boarded the Cariboo Prospector. It&#8217;s a three-car Rail Diesel Car (RDC) passenger train that runs between Prince George and North Vancouver.<br />
(An RDC, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a self-propelled passenger car. They were developed in the 50s by the Budd Car Company as a means for simple passenger operation without the need for an extra locomotive. For a while, RDCs were a common site in North America. Now they are a dying breed. In Canada, only BC Rail and VIA still run RDCs, and only in three places: Victoria-Courteney on Vancouver Island (VIA), Sudbury-White River in Ontario (VIA), and Prince George-North Vancouver.)<br />
This will be an important trip for me. Due to budget cuts at BC Rail, the Prospector will cease operations at the end of October. This is also true for BC Rail&#8217;s other services, the Pacific Starlight and the Whistler Northwind. The Royal Hudson service already met with an ignominious end when both 2860 and 3716 steam locomotives required maintenance. Their end came in 1999. (2860 is now on display at the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish. 3716 is stored unserviceable at BC Rail.)<br />
It is truly a shame that a service such as this would befall such a fate. While perhaps not the speediest form of transportation, it is very comfortable, and you simply can&#8217;t see this country any other way. And that&#8217;s not to count the necessity. There&#8217;s a native tribe just south of Lillooet that needs the service to get from Lillooet to their home. With the service ending, they needed to contract a shuttle with BC Rail.<br />
It&#8217;s a 15 hour trip from Prince George to North Vancouver. It&#8217;s not only a trip through some of the most beautiful country in Canada, but it&#8217;s also a test of endurance. If you can&#8217;t survive 15 hours on one day, how would you survive 33 days?<br />
This was one day I was happy to endure. The weather wasn&#8217;t the most ideal, admittedly. That didn&#8217;t take away from the majesty of our natural ecosystems or of the sculpted terrain. Though the cloudy skies did bring an early night.<br />
The trip is run as a partial tourist train. It was initially started to serve the countless little communities between the Lower Mainland and Prince George (most of them remnants from the Gold Rush). Either through evolution or through need, it soon became a partial tourist train. As the train rolls along, one of the train crew points out sights and tells some of the local history. The fact that you&#8217;re fed breakfast, lunch, and dinner as you ride is an added bonus.<br />
The only real down side of the trip is that you&#8217;re confined to your car for the duration of the journey. You aren&#8217;t allowed between cars, and most of the stops are too brief to let people off. Between Lillooet and North Vancouver, there was only one stop of sufficient length for people to stretch their legs.<br />
By the time we reached Whistler, it was darkening fast. Not far past the resort, you could barely make out silhouettes, let alone the colours or objects. The remainder of the ride to North Vancouver was quiet and uneventful. Once we entered sight of the Lions Gate Bridge, however, the lights of the night city were spectacular.<br />
My friend Joel and his wife Michelle greeted me at the station. They had offered me refuge for a few days before I started with the CBC. Though they lived nearly an hour out of downtown, the need for rest and quiet were more than appealing enough. Fifteen hours of travel isn&#8217;t physically tiring, but it is draining.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 8 days<br />
There&#8217;s nothing like trying to plan one and a half months of a chaotic life in excruciating detail. It&#8217;s a little easier when someone else does all the dirty work, but ultimately, it&#8217;s you that will make it flow smoothly.<br />
In my case, it was extracting myself from my life. Really, it was the only way to make any kind of a clean break. But in a fashion typical of myself, I still managed to be running around for the last 45 minutes of being at the office. It seems no amount of preparation can prevent that.<br />
Of course, it didn&#8217;t help that Purolator missorted my advance cheque from the CBC. That caused me to call the courier and see if I could divert it to Vancouver. I won&#8217;t know if I was successful until 4 September.<br />
On of the things I left too late was booking a hotel room. Why I left it so late is anybody&#8217;s guess (&#8216;cuz I don&#8217;t know). But it meant that I still needed to clear it up before I boarded my plane.<br />
My flight to Vancouver was its usual uneventful passage. Although I had booked a window seat, I offered it to a young girl who was flying alone and would have sat between two men. The seat was cramped, and not leather (see [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]]). For such a short flight, it wasn&#8217;t necessary. But it would still have been nice.<br />
My stop in Vancouver was short. I almost walked out of one terminal gate and right into the adjacent gate. All that prevented me was a 25-minute wait until the next flight started its boarding call.<br />
I was off to Prince George, &#8220;Gateway to the North&#8221; and the geographical centre of British Columbia. I had exactly the same seat booked that I would have had in the previous flight (had I not given up my window view). But this time, I wanted to see the landscape. We left early (how often that happen?). The flight was short, and soon we arrived at the smallest airport I think I&#8217;ve ever been to. Not many airports require planes to turn around on the runway to get to the terminal.<br />
The terminal building was even smaller than Hamilton&#8217;s. There&#8217;s one baggage carousel, which opens directly to the outside. There&#8217;s one gate. Now that&#8217;s small.<br />
Grabbing an airporter, I found my way to the Downtown Motel. It was, I think, the last available room in Prince George. It wasn&#8217;t the Fairmont Palliser, but it had a comfy bed at a reasonable price. (Even if the room was permeated with a deodourizer that smelled almost worse than the cigarette smoke it was supposed to cover up.)<br />
So why the shortage of rooms? After dinner at the Shogun at the Coast of the North hotel, I wandered around to take pictures. In the process, I ran into three wonderfully chatty elderly women competing in the BC Senior Games. The games are running this weekend in Prince George. Hence, no rooms.<br />
We talked a fairly long time &#8211; they were quite puzzled why I would be running around at night taking pictures. Prince George has some great vistas, including the new art gallery just west of city hall. The lighting at night really brings out the gallery&#8217;s unique construction.<br />
While I was there talking, we were approached by two of the volunteers who were helping at the games. They were wondering what we were talking about. Over the course of a shorter conversation, I found that Prince George has 26 sawmills. While an impressive-sounding number, the reality is much less impressive. Of those, only 11 or 12 are still open.<br />
Bed soon beckoned. I had a very early morning to come, and sleep was a necessity.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are times that I&#8217;m almost envious of myself. Well, okay, one time that I&#8217;m envious of myself. Hey, it&#8217;s better than being jealous of others&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m going on a train trip. But not any train trip. In fact, this falls into the &#8220;Once an Orbit of Pluto&#8221; category. And it all started when I read the following in a reply from my friend Brenda:<br />
&#8220;hey if the cbc sent a train from coast to coast for 38 days of travel and events in september/october for its 50th anniversary celebrations, would you like to go to document the trip/take pictures/take video/set up (take down) kiosks at events/chat with the public/hang out with cbc celebrities?&#8221;<br />
I actually fell back in my chair, staring at what I&#8217;d just read. I looked all around for any sign of Allen Funt&#8217;s descendants. I pinched, splashed cold water, and tried to wake up, just to be safe. My reply was something along the lines of:<br />
&#8220;How many limbs and first-born children do you want?&#8221;<br />
Brenda, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, works at the CBC. She got handed this project, and was in the process of trying to get it back on track. (Yes, it&#8217;s a pun. Deal with it.) This spun off a long string of emails of questions, more than should be asked of a single person. But in short order, we&#8217;d determined what was going to happen.<br />
Well, almost. First I had one minor detail to contend with: Getting time off work.<br />
Over the last two years, I&#8217;ve managed to weasel my way into a position/role of far too much responsibility and pseudo-authority. My first initial thought was that I would have to go back to Brenda and regretfully decline. But it never hurts to ask.<br />
So the day my boss returned from his honeymoon, I pulled him into a meeting room, and delivered the following speech.<br />
Me: First off, I&#8217;m not quitting.<br />
Him: (Either not caring, or not showing the huge sigh of relief) Okay.<br />
Me: Here&#8217;s the deal. This is the 50th anniversary of the CBC, and they want to make a big thing of it. So they&#8217;re sending a train across Canada for about two months, making stops and doing presentations, and they need someone to do computer work, take pictures, document the trip, shoot video, and probably a billion other things. She wants me to go. I want to go. I need two months off.<br />
Him: (Without barely a pause) Okay.<br />
I love this company.<br />
Over the next few weeks, having to shoot video dropped from the radar, and the time shortened to just under a month and a half. But I had the green light, and it was full steam ahead.<br />
Until yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t really talk about it (see [[Working at CBC Headquarters in Toronto]]). Okay, I had talked about it to a few people, but that was before I found out I wasn&#8217;t supposed to. But yesterday was the official first notice to the world of the CBC&#8217;s intentions. So I&#8217;m free to talk.<br />
On 3 September, I&#8217;ll be in Vancouver, getting the train ready, finishing my training (no pun intended) and preparing for the Big Event. 7 September is our first public event, in Vancouver. From there, we visit Kamloops, Jasper, Edmonton, Biggar, Saskatoon, Melville, Winnipeg, Sioux Lookout, Capreol, Sudbury, Windsor, London, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Campbellton, Moncton, and finishing in Halifax on 5 October.<br />
To say I&#8217;m excited is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that concentrating at work as been a little difficult as of late.<br />
So what&#8217;s my part in all this? I&#8217;ll be the New Media Representative. My job will be to keep the New Media side of things running. This includes 6-9 kiosks (depending on who you ask), taking pictures, handing out free stuff, setting up displays (and taking them down), and writing about it in journal entries. Starting in September, you&#8217;ll be able to keep track of (almost) my every move on CBC&#8217;s website.<br />
And I&#8217;m gonna be on a train for 33 glorious days. (If you can&#8217;t see the dopey grin on my face right now, your monitor must be broken.) The only bad part of this is that I have to wait three weeks for all this to start. I don&#8217;t know if I can hold out that long.<br />
I&#8217;m gonna be working on the railroad, all the live long month and a half!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Somewhere, in a long-forgotten book in some dusty corner of a decrepit building in a burned out city, there is a sentence that says vacations are supposed to be restful. And someone is going to a lot of trouble to make sure I can&#8217;t find that sentence.<br />
Last week, starting very early on 3 August, I flew to Ontario. As luck would have it, I was on the same red-eye flight with my cousin Pam and her beau, Sean. Normally, this would be reason for celebration, but flying red-eye basically means you sleep the whole way. And believe me, sleeping is far easier with leather seats.<br />
Yes, leather. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten into WestJet, but at least one of their planes has leather seats. Not just one. Not just a few. All of the seats. The only downer: The ones backing onto the emergency exit rows don&#8217;t recline. (I found out the hard way.)<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering what I was doing on a red-eye flight given my dislike for them (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), but it came down to an issue of price. Red-eyes are cheap. And with leather seats, I might be doing more red-eyes in the future.<br />
This was the first time I flew into Pearson on WestJet, and I reminded myself yet again why I hate that airport. It&#8217;s too slow. Cathy was circling for over 20 minutes before hearing from me. I told her to park &#8212; I was going to be a while longer.<br />
Bags in hand, Cathy and I headed to Oakville. Pam and Sean disappeared to Stratford. We wouldn&#8217;t see them again until the following Friday. Arriving home, my mother welcomed me at the door, and I made a beeline for the bed.<br />
Leather seats or not, I didn&#8217;t get enough sleep.<br />
The Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were filled with various wedding-related tasks, not the least of which was picking things up, dropping things off, and getting things organized. (Yeah, real vague, I know, but I&#8217;d be writing an entire log entry just on that stuff alone.)<br />
Oh, whose wedding, you ask? I&#8217;ll give you a hint: Not mine.<br />
After a long wait, my sister&#8217;s beau, Craig, finally proposed to her on Christmas morning (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), making not only Cathy very happy, but the rest of my family as well. And after almost eight long months of waiting, it was time for the happy day to arrive.<br />
I had originally come out to Ontario a week in advance to help out with all the little last-minute details that I expected would crop up. But unbeknownst to me, events would transpire that would change the course of my week.<br />
Details on that in a following log, of course.<br />
Suffice to say, come Tuesday, I was no longer in Oakville. Instead, I spent a lot of time at the CBC head office on Front Street (see [[Working at CBC Headquarters in Toronto]]), working for my friend Brenda. That sucked up pretty much every spare second I had for four days, although I did manage to leave at a somewhat &#8220;respectable&#8221; hour on Thursday to return home for dinner (the family invasion formally began that evening) and early on Friday (for obvious reasons).<br />
But even on Saturday morning, we didn&#8217;t get a chance to slow down. It was go-go-go from the moment my alarm went off at 8:00am. The first task for me was to get Craig and Dave (Craig&#8217;s best man) over to the barber so we could get our haircut. (Mine was looking something like a floor mop.)<br />
Craig and Dave were the first ones up, disposing of their excess locks. Completed, they disappeared off to Craig and Cathy&#8217;s house to await orders. My turn. So in addition to looking respectable again (yeah, tough as that might sound), I also had a shave. A real one. With a straight razor. Luckily, Sandy is one of the best barbers in Ontario; certainly the best I&#8217;ve ever had. I had complete faith in him not to slice something off.<br />
I should point out that I&#8217;ve never had a shave with anything but an electric razor. So my skin is quite sensitive. Sandy had to shave me twice to prevent slicing me open. But he did a good job &#8212; even by 11pm, I hadn&#8217;t grown much of a beard back, and I grow fast.<br />
Following the shave was some chores around the house &#8212; mostly moving things. (Aunt Ruth was madly preparing flowers, which needed placing; Aunt Karen brought a light trellis that needed assembling; and flowers all over the place needed watering.) And somewhere in all that, I ran to the grocery store to stock up on almost $80 in Clamato and orange juice.<br />
After a quick bolt through the shower, I rode over to pick up Craig and Dave. They were dressed in their finest, ready for the show. I piled them into the minivan, and hauled them back to the Sowrey homestead. People had started to arrive, though it was mostly family. But you could hear the Great Engine beginning to turn over&#8230;<br />
Inside, people were officially going crazy. Mom was getting dressed, Cathy was talking with everyone, the caterers were running around &#8230; I almost felt like I was in a Keystone Cops short. But it was time for myself to get dressed. Unlike Craig and Dave, though, I would not be wearing a tux. Cathy had made one request: Wear Dad&#8217;s kilt.<br />
When Dad had been diagnosed with brain cancer, he had been told he had a year to live. All he wanted to know was if he would live to see his daughter&#8217;s wedding. When he passed away in March, there was a hole that needed filling.<br />
Instead of Dad, it would be I who would walk Cathy down the aisle. And she was only walking down it if there was someone next to her wearing Dad&#8217;s kilt. Luckily for me, it fit, albeit a little tight and very warm in that mid-August heat.<br />
Oh, and in case you&#8217;re wondering, I did not wear it regimental style. (That means sans undergarments.) Why? Well, originally I was, but then I remembered all the troublemakers C&amp;C had invited to the party, and suddenly I wasn&#8217;t really filled with a great deal of confidence about their abilities to remain mature. (I was right, too. Cathy&#8217;s boss shoved one of the disposable cameras under my kilt while we were engaged in group photos.)<br />
The minister arrived and gave the &#8220;pep&#8221; talks with Craig and Cathy (independently &#8212; Cathy forbade Craig to see her prior to the ceremony). There was no practice ceremony &#8212; C&amp;C (as we in the family refer to them) like flying by the seat of their pants.<br />
After running around for about 20 minutes, Cathy finally pronounced she was ready. The minister pronounced he was ready. (I don&#8217;t think Craig had a choice.) It was time. The music was cued, and Cathy went out the front door.<br />
The guests waited in the backyard. Cathy, Julie, and I walked to the side. Julie took a deep breath, and then walked through the gate to the snapping of shutters. We&#8217;d been told to give Julie lots of room before coming in. Dramatic pause, dawdling, psychological torture, call it what you will. Right up until we started walking in, arm in arm, Cathy had been cool and collected. The second we rounded that corner, she couldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
I felt a little guilty. This was Cathy&#8217;s big day, and I was sharing the limelight with her. At first, I was just walking my sister. But after a few moments, it suddenly became real. Like someone had wiped the fog from the bathroom mirror. To say the feeling was overwhelming is like suggesting a hurricane is a light breeze. It took everything I had not to cry.<br />
Once Cathy was next to Craig, the ceremony started to take shape, and things went quickly. True to their word, it lasted only 20 minutes before the legalities were over, and the new Mr. and Mrs. were presented to the assembly. Many pictures ensued.<br />
After they ceremoniously walked out as husband and wife (returning after a few photos on the front lawn), came the toast to the couple. Huntsville Dave would be the speaker, a neighbour of C&amp;C at their cottage. He, like the rest of the ceremony, spoke without a script, and without a clue about what he was going to say before it was said.<br />
(A note on Daves. C&amp;C seem to know a lot of them. Too many, as a matter of fact. So many, that they all have qualifiers, usually denoting where they live: Huntsville, Scarborough, Ainsville, Oakville, and so forth.)<br />
As the speech finished, I quickly ducked inside to take off the jacket to the kilt. Although I would later learn that it is customary to keep your jacket on until the groom removes his, I was wearing something designed for winter conditions. With all due deference to my new brother-in-law, I was dying in that thing.<br />
Shortly after, we gathered the families, and went for the photographs. Cameras were everywhere. We were lucky that it was bright enough that most didn&#8217;t use flashes. I can only imagine the bright spots I would have seen.<br />
While this was going on, the catering staff had opened the bar, and people not taking pictures (or being in them) had started to mingle. Hors d&#8217;oeurves were shortly followed, and quickly eaten. There was laughter, music, food, and drink. No-one, as far as I can tell, had a bad time.<br />
The finger foods soon gave way to more &#8220;formal&#8221; foods: seafood (raw oysters, lox, shrimp), sushi, and roast beef on a bun. Yeah, doesn&#8217;t sound too fancy, but then the food should fit the couple. (I&#8217;m not saying C&amp;C aren&#8217;t fancy, but they&#8217;re not pretentious.) And for the record, I&#8217;ve never had buffet-style roast beef that good before.<br />
After a while, the speeches started. Cathy had hit upon the idea of using an old family gong to get people&#8217;s attention when words were to be said, and people to expect a kiss from the bride and groom. The first few were tame (even with a rather emotional speech from Cathy&#8217;s boss), but they got more interesting as the evening wore on.<br />
The one that really surprised us was Julie&#8217;s husband, Dave. He&#8217;s a great guy, just not usually talkative. We were floored when he got up in front of 90-odd people to extol the virtues of his friends. (We were even more floored with his impassioned interpretation of the Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; later on.)<br />
And somewhere in there, was my speech. But this wasn&#8217;t to C&amp;C, it was on behalf of the family to everyone else. It was thanks for the effort and trouble people had to go through to come, some from as far as Anguilla and Vancouver. (Even Gerry and Sam dropped in for a while, who live in Bermuda. Although they were in the area for other reasons.) When it came time to end my speech, I needed a something interesting, funny, and appropriate. So naturally, I drew a blank.<br />
I think that&#8217;s when Dad stepped in. Before I knew it, this is what I&#8217;d said:<br />
&#8220;And if you should find that something is missing here tonight, please do not hesitate to let us know. We&#8217;ll make sure that you get so drunk that you won&#8217;t remember.&#8221;<br />
Dad had definitely made it to the wedding.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before it was time for the first dance. Craig used to teach dance at Arthur Murray, so we all expected quite a show. Unfortunately, he hadn&#8217;t had a chance to teach Cathy yet. But it was still something out of a fairy tale to watch.<br />
Following the dance, it was time to dance with the parents. I was to fill in for Dad. However, we had a slight change in plans, when Don stepped instead. Don is virtually a surrogate father for Cathy and I &#8212; we&#8217;ve known him that long. I think Cathy was a little concerned that I felt pushed out in favour of Don, but I think there was no better person for the job.<br />
Besides, I can&#8217;t dance.<br />
Admittedly, the rest of the evening gets a little hazy from there. About 11:00 or so, I made the mistake of switching from beer to wine, although I don&#8217;t know why. So come about 2:00am, I was apparently incapable of independent vertical alignment, nor could annunciate baby gibberish, let alone a coherent sentence. And I would pay dearly for it the next morning.<br />
Which began at about 10:00am. We had to get ready for the lunch with family, as many of them would be taking off for home again. This also gave C&amp;C time to unwrap the presents they received the night before.<br />
The barbecue billowed smoke from all the hamburgers, the pot boiled corn, and we ate to our hearts&#8217; content. It was a good day, following a great night. And the hilarity around the presents made it even better.<br />
The single best one, in my opinion, was from the Navis family, an old family friend. They gave C&amp;C a poem, on which was a series of instructions on how to build a fence. Each step corresponded to a numbered envelope, which contained a series of gift certificates representative of that step (e.g. coffee, wood, beer, and dinner). And to top it off, his and her hammers and pint beer mugs.<br />
That night, we sat in the back yard, and listened to the crickets, the wind through the trees, and the complete lack of any semblance of traffic or other noises. As Don, another old family friend remarked, it was the end of an era. His era was the end of comfortable backyards. Mine was different. It was the end of the neighbourhood as I knew it. It would be the last night for me next to the pool. The last meal was Chinese. The last swim had been with my cousin, Jen. It would be the last night I slept in the house that I was raised in.<br />
But no amount of sombreness would diminish the happiness of the previous days&#8217; events. The wedding had been more than Cathy could have dreamed for. She and Craig were now readying for a week at their cottage to spend some much needed time relaxing. We would all be happy with the way things went, and with the way things would go.<br />
Even with the killer hangover that I think I&#8217;ve still got.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my second day here at the CBC head office in Toronto. This is a weird place.<br />
You&#8217;re probably asking: What is Geoff doing at the CBC head office in Toronto? That&#8217;s a question I can&#8217;t answer just yet &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to wait until next Tuesday. (The irony is that this won&#8217;t be posted until after I can say what I&#8217;m doing at the CBC. So I could tell you why I&#8217;m here. But hey, it&#8217;s all about telling a story.)<br />
I came in yesterday, taking the GO Train from Clarkson, in the very west of Mississauga. The trip out was quite pleasant (the joys of express trains), and relaxing &#8230; so I thought. The train arrived smoothly and without urgency. I was expecting a leisurely walk to the CBC building (I was a half hour early). Wrong expectation.<br />
As soon as the doors opened, I was overwhelmed with a panic, similar to that of stampeding animals. I felt the urge to move very quickly, and stay with the herd, er, crowd.<br />
Now I remember why I like living in Calgary &#8212; less pressure.<br />
Wandering down Front Street, I quite quickly found myself at the main doors. Not only was I very early, but I was remarking at how HUGE this place is. The building is the size of a city block, no question. It&#8217;s 10 stories tall, not counting the basements. It&#8217;s so big it has at least four sets of elevators &#8212; probably six or more. They&#8217;re colour-coded so you can find them easily.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you can find anything in this building. King Minos&#8217; labyrinth wasn&#8217;t this confusing. (Nor was the 6th floor of the Math and Computer building at the University of Waterloo, despite its near-legendary lack of structure.)<br />
It&#8217;s a bit of a surreal experience. It&#8217;s a true media outlet. (The only thing the CBC doesn&#8217;t touch is print &#8212; but give them the chance, and I&#8217;d bet they would.) You&#8217;d almost expect to run into one of a large number of semi-famous people (I reserve &#8220;famous&#8221; for those instantly recognizable) roaming the halls.<br />
I have yet to see Peter Mansbridge, though.<br />
It took me most of yesterday to get the gist of how this place works. Luckily for me, Brenda returned this morning to really get things moving. While I have a vague idea of what I need to do, Brenda had a lot of the details I didn&#8217;t.<br />
The building offers some interesting services, aside from the media aspects, of course. There&#8217;s the Glenn Gould Studio, a concert hall cum recording studio; robotic mail delivery; an in-house credit union (almost every employee here is unionized); a very in-depth intranet; a beautiful atrium (big bucks in construction, no doubt) that includes a sushi bar; a museum (or three); and probably a lot of stuff I just haven&#8217;t found yet.<br />
And I&#8217;ve only been here two days. I&#8217;ll be here for a couple of days more, though. Then it&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s wedding, and back home.<br />
Three weeks later, I&#8217;m off on another adventure of a lifetime.<br />
Which I can&#8217;t tell you about.<br />
Yet.</p>

	<header class="entry-header">
		
		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://geoff.wp/2002/07/chasing-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/" rel="bookmark">Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been about nine months since I last saw 6060, when I left Jasper for Calgary. That&#8217;s about eight months too long, I figure.<br />
Mind you, many haven&#8217;t seen 6060 since early November, since we&#8217;ve all been off living our lives while she sat in a shed for the winter. And as we had little money for maintenance work, little was done over the winter. In fact, almost nothing&#8217;s been done this spring or summer, either. It&#8217;s very handy when you pass all of your inspections.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be problems. Arriving just after 9:00, I found a large portion of the team staring at the air compressor. Apparently, on it&#8217;s first run of the year (the day before), the compressor had lost its lubricant. Something wasn&#8217;t working.<br />
What exactly was broken, I&#8217;m not sure. But it took seven people to get it back together again. (There&#8217;s a joke about trainmen and a lightbulb in there somewhere.) The air compressor is a vastly complicated piece of machinery &#8212; something I fear I&#8217;ll one day have to pull apart to repair. But I got my first taste, so hopefully next time it won&#8217;t be so bad.<br />
Just so long as my memory of what we did doesn&#8217;t get displaced by some other seemingly random piece of useless trivia.<br />
But just after noon, we declared 6060 fully operational (without the air compressor, we would have gone nowhere), and were ready to do the run to Big Valley. 6060 will do only seven runs this year. It&#8217;s a small number, but it&#8217;s far better than just sitting around. Luckily, this was one run I got to follow.<br />
The Stettler to Big Valley run is quite short &#8212; only about 30 kilometres. Mind you, it takes over an hour to run it, because 6060 can&#8217;t run quickly on the line with passengers. That makes it very easy to pass for taking pictures. Which is precisely what Graham and I did that Saturday afternoon.<br />
Interestingly enough, I first met Graham chasing 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It didn&#8217;t take long for us to become friends, having a mutual love for trains (although I lean more to steam; Graham&#8217;s partial to anything on rails). It also didn&#8217;t take long to convince Graham to join the Rocky Mountain Rail Society.<br />
This was Graham&#8217;s first meeting with the RMRS, although he nearly missed 6060&#8217;s 14:30 departure from Stettler. We hooked up about a half-kilometre down the line from the station. And we started taking pictures.<br />
Graham had never been to Stettler before, and had never been down any of the side roads in the Stettler / Big Valley area. They&#8217;re a little hairy. Especially when you&#8217;re trying to outrun a train. (Even if it slow-moving.)<br />
Our first pictures were at a station-like landing just down from the station itself. Then we raced to the crossing just as you exited Stettler heading south on Hwy. 56. After that, we headed down to the road crossing at Warden. Followed by Warden South. And then at multiple crossings and hills overlooking the rails all the way down.<br />
The road we were on didn&#8217;t follow the tracks perfect, so we&#8217;d regularly lose sight of the rails. This was a problem because sometimes, the tracks would suddenly reappear, and you had to quickly judge whether it was worth stopping, or continuing down. And the suddenness was the problem &#8212; if you slammed on your brakes on the loose gravel road, you&#8217;d fishtail quite easily.<br />
I did a few times. (Although I had a rally car-like turn at one corner, trying to avoid a dog I saw, and turning onto a road about 10 seconds ahead of 6060. After I realized I wasn&#8217;t going to die, I was quite pleased with myself.)<br />
Taking pictures where we could, we weaved our way down to Big Valley, arriving in time to catch the train being held up by bandits (part of the show), and meeting the train in Big Valley itself. It was a little harried, but I introduced Graham to Don, Harry, Terry, and anyone else from the RMRS I could find.<br />
But then it was off for us, back to Calgary. (Separate ways, that is.) As much as I wanted to follow 6060 back to Stettler, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t last long enough. I was pretty tired and wanted to go home and rest. I&#8217;ll do the full run next time.<br />
Though not quite as fast, I think.</p>
