Day 18<br />
Ivan and I met arrived at Union Station at almost the same time, but from opposite ends of the GTA. Both of us had taken the GO Train to downtown. We met, as planned days earlier, under the clock in the centre of the Union Station upper atrium. The arranged meeting time was 9:15; Ivan and I were a good 45 minutes ahead of schedule (mostly due to how frequently the GO Trains run in the morning &#8212; though for me, it was also making sure I was punctual). We grabbed a quick breakfast at the Harvey&#8217;s while we waited.<br />
One by one, people slowly began to arrive. Sometimes in twos, but usually individually. While we were waiting around for more people, Daryl pointed out a book on sale at an adjacent kiosk. It was a photography book whose subjects were railroad-oriented (not necessarily trains). The pictures were mostly black and white. All of them were strangely mesmerizing &#8212; things you wouldn&#8217;t normally think to take pictures of. And for $10, you certainly can&#8217;t go wrong!<br />
The crew had almost all arrived by 9:15, at which time we headed into the train. Although everyone who could go home (a few of us live out of town) enjoyed sleeping in their own beds and being with family, every second utterance I heard as we climbed aboard was &#8220;it&#8217;s good to be home&#8221;.<br />
Many of us, including myself, are now fighting off a cold. Illness spreads quickly when people are in confined spaces for long lengths of time. (That, combined with lack of sleep and lots of stress, usually do a number on the human immune system.) Luckily, it&#8217;s nothing serious, just your run-of-the-train kind of rhinovirus. More annoying than debilitating.<br />
We said farewell to Jason, Debbie, and Ingrid in Toronto. This morning, Lisa joined us to take Jason&#8217;s place. Hopefully she won&#8217;t feel too excluded from our group &#8212; I suspect it won&#8217;t take long for her to blend in. We have no replacement for Ingrid, and I&#8217;ll be on my own until we get to Montreal. For a while, I&#8217;ll know how Cliff must have felt in the first couple of weeks, before Trish joined us.<br />
The trip to Ottawa was fairly expedient. I&#8217;d taken the train between Ottawa and Toronto only once before, but that was on an LRC from Ottawa. This time, I rode in the Skyline dome, watching the world pass by in a way I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d see. We were eating lunch when we passed through Kingston. We waved at the dozens of people who lined the platforms waiting for us to pass through<br />
Our trip up the Alexandria Subdivision (Brockville to just south of Ottawa) took a little longer than planned, mostly due to a rail traffic jam. The Alexandria Sub is single track, and if one train is late, it throws the entire schedule off. We ended up a little behind schedule arriving at the Ottawa station. Unfortunately, we never recovered that time. Due to depart the station around 18:00, we didn&#8217;t end up leaving until almost 19:00. (I have no idea why.) At an agonizingly slow speed, we shunted around Ottawa until we could back up the spur to the Canada Science and Technology Museum. While it was torture for us, the train chasers who lined our route must have loved the slow pace.<br />
Arriving over two hours late at the museum, we had to wait while VIA spent over an hour shunting the Renaissance train. The tension level on our train skyrocketed to an all-time high. Even the agony of Winnipeg seemed a dull ache compared to the fury rising in many people. The CBC staff and our VIA crew were about ready to start breaking windows and jumping from open doors. It wasn&#8217;t so much that we were stir-crazy, but that stupid Renaissance train has been putting us behind schedule consistently since we picked it up on the 19th.<br />
Although we never admitted to it publicly at the time, we were ready to do something nasty to the Renaissance train. Something that would prevent it coming with us for the remainder of the trip The delays were intolerable, and inexcuseable. This was supposed to be our show, not VIA&#8217;s, and their constant delays were causing us to miss schedules and inconvenience everyone.<br />
Finally, four hours after we were to start our partial set-up (tents and kiosks), we detrained and proceeded to quickly unload the baggage car. In just over an hour, we erected all the tents, and were ready to finish our set up the following day. We ended up having to do more work than we should have, but mostly because we had to make sure that the museum would be ready for operation in the morning &#8212; the schools would start early.<br />
Taxis started arriving not shortly after we finished, and we all headed to the hotel to check in. Being a complete idiot, I left my wallet on the train. This made checking in a little more difficult. (It would also make going out troublesome.) I wouldn&#8217;t be able to access any services, but I could at least shower and sleep that night.<br />
The phone in my room already had a message. Terri and Elizabeth, from New Media in Toronto, are joining me for the 12-hour event tomorrow. I&#8217;m very thankful they&#8217;re coming. Doing this with two people is difficult, let alone one. Stretch that over 12 hours, and I&#8217;d be about ready for a long stay in a rubber room by the end of the day.<br />
We broke for a late snack at a pub across the road. I had to beg and borrow due to my lack of foresight (see my wallet comment). Despite all the grumblings earlier in the day, everyone seemed to be in good spirits. In fact, we seem to be really positive about tomorrow&#8217;s event.</p>

Day 17<br />
For the first time since our trip began, I had a day where I didn&#8217;t see a single person from the train. It felt weird.<br />
I spent the day with my family, after sleeping a few extra hours (sleeping in never felt so good). I had hoped to make it a whole day without having to move something. Fate, as it seems, had other ideas in mind. My mother, however, has not completed the move from her home to her condominium.<br />
I&#8217;ll give you three guesses what I was doing for part of the afternoon.<br />
Today I realized just how much this trip has meant to me. I&#8217;ve written many times about the camaraderie, the challenges, and the excitement. But it&#8217;s one thing to write about those things while you&#8217;re amidst the action &#8212; it&#8217;s completely different when you&#8217;re reflecting on it.<br />
That&#8217;s what today was for me: my first chance to ruminate on what we&#8217;ve done. It&#8217;s more than just crossing the country by train, though that would be enough for me. It&#8217;s having seen the happy faces of visitors to our exhibits. It&#8217;s having people learn a little about the CBC, and in turn about the culture of Canada. It&#8217;s hearing about how people feel included in something. It&#8217;s about seeing humanity.<br />
Even on board the train, we have our own culture. It&#8217;s a microcosm of life. We live together in a stainless steel box barely 11 feet wide, 20 feet tall (in places), and just over 700 feet long. Submarines have more room than we do. Yet we are happy to be there. We are happy to bring the CBC to places that wouldn&#8217;t normally see the museum. We are happy to tell others that they are as much a part of the CBC as anyone else.<br />
Tomorrow, our trek resumes. I just can&#8217;t wait to get on the road again.</p>

Day 16<br />
Five of our team staying at the hotel met in the lobby at 7:15 to walk to Union Station. Only a couple of blocks away, it wasn&#8217;t a long walk. Carrying a full hiking backpack, camera bag, laptop, and duffle bag, I must have been quite the sight walking down Front Street.<br />
Finding our train on Track 1, I dumped my bags in the Park car, and awaited instructions. We had to be ready for 11:00. And the train was pointing in the wrong direction. To solve this, we completely unloaded the baggage car into the Skywalk so the train could go out to turn around. We had one hour.<br />
Packing and unpacking the train used to be stressful. It used to be difficult. Now it&#8217;s routine. The running joke was that we&#8217;d have it all worked out when we got to Halifax. Who knew it would be before Toronto?<br />
We were setting up in two locations in and around Union Station. News, Children&#8217;s, and the Boutique took up home in the Skywalk. Sports and New Media were slated for outside, along Front Street. This wouldn&#8217;t have been quite so bad, except New Media&#8217;s home was behind the stage, downwind from the diesel generators. For the first time since this tour started, I was angry.<br />
It seemed as if New Media had become an afterthought, wedged off in the corner because no-one else knew what to do with it. The fact that we were behind the stage was just insult upon injury.<br />
I didn&#8217;t want to be outside, even with our lousy location. According to the weather forecast, it was supposed to rain. New Media has nine computers (with nine LCD monitors), and a plasma display. It&#8217;s possibly the most expensive display in our travelling open house. As far as I was concerned, it was either full set-up inside, or as we&#8217;d done in Windsor, a partial outside.<br />
Debbie and I complained. I hate complaining, but we had little choice. Eventually, we won the opportunity to be inside. But all we did was go through the doors. We didn&#8217;t move any closer to the others. We were still isolated. No signage, no pointers, and now even the map was wrong. For the first hour, Debbie and I moped. We were not happy campers, but moving seemed out of the question.<br />
For a while, the people passing New Media were interested only in VIA&#8217;s Renaissance train. This didn&#8217;t exactly make our mood soar. But then people started looking for us. Most of the others in the CBC team were amazed that we&#8217;d been dumped off in a corner, and I think a few people were directed to us. Although we never came close to the crowds we had in Edmonton, we were happy to have people come by, use our computers, and learn a little about the CBC.<br />
Our volunteers were all from the CBC, and were extremely helpful. We all fielded questions, from the simple (&#8220;how do I see the train&#8221;) to the difficult (&#8220;do you have archives of [insert show here]&#8221;).<br />
One such request came from a gentleman who had purchased the book &#8220;Looking Back&#8221;, which covers the history of CBC Television. He had a list of nine classic CBC shows. He wanted to know what month and year the shows had switched from black and white to colour. The five of us, including Julie, just scratched our heads. He didn&#8217;t walk away empty-handed, however, as Julie and Debbie were able to direct him to Audience Relations. A researcher will hopefully soon solve the problem.<br />
As I was finishing helping a woman cast her ShowVote for Beachcombers, I heard my name called out. I turned to see a face I hadn&#8217;t seen for over three years: my friends Jason and Stephanie (with their two children). They had driven over an hour to come down and see the show, and to see me. We talked for a while, before I suggested they get in line for the museum before the line got too long.<br />
About an hour later, our walkie-talkie crackled with &#8220;Geoff Sowrey, what&#8217;s your 20?&#8221; (That&#8217;s radioese for &#8220;where are you&#8221;?) A few minutes later, my Aunt Ruth and cousin Lauren appeared. I was having a field day of visitors. We chatted for a brief time, and I told them what our journey was like, and how much fun (despite all the bruises and lack of sleep) we were having. Little did I know, though, that the call for my whereabouts hadn&#8217;t been from my family.<br />
Debbie (Hynes, not Lindsey) approached, toting two people she had guided down from the Skywalk. Emily and Sydney were looking for me. Both are loyal fans of the CBC, particularly radio. Emily regularly reads the cbc.ca website. That&#8217;s how Emily found the journal entries I write. She&#8217;s been following our exploits since the beginning, and she wanted to meet the person who&#8217;s been writing about them.<br />
Then I got the biggest compliment I&#8217;ve ever had. For years, I&#8217;ve had a few people tell me that my writing is a little wordy (if you&#8217;ve read the previous entries, you&#8217;ve probably figured this out by now). I&#8217;m a descriptive person. It seems, though, that I have the perfect audience: the visually impaired. Both Emily and Sydney are legally blind. They can read with the assistance of magnifying glasses, or leaning in close to monitors using large fonts. That also means that they cannot see what I&#8217;ve seen so far on this trip. My wordiness, however, does allow them to imagine the sights.<br />
Flounders can&#8217;t get any more flattered than I was. I&#8217;ve never had a total stranger come up to me and compliment me on the work that I do. Now I know how famous people must feel like. It&#8217;s very humbling.<br />
While I was revelling in the compliment, Emily proceeded to tell me how she and Sydney lived on a fixed income. And with $16 of their last $20 of the month, had travelled from Hamilton to Toronto, using whatever means possible. Just so they could meet me.<br />
I almost cried. My aunt and cousin, who were sitting nearby, took pictures of us for posterity.<br />
We talked probably for over an hour before Emily and Sydney carried on their tour of Toronto. My aunt and cousin left shortly after. Then I finally got to have lunch, with my friend Kim and her friend Rob.<br />
The afternoon disappeared quickly, and soon it was time to start taking down our equipment. Striking the set was immeasurably easier than putting it together, partly because there was no question where we were going. Also because our volunteers needed no guidance for putting things back in boxes.<br />
Without trying, we packed up in two hours. After a quick debriefing, we were off in different directions again. This time, however, I was off to Oakville to visit with family. Tomorrow, we have our second day off. It will be the first day we&#8217;ll all be away from each other. The feeling is a little strange.<br />
Originally going to take the GO Train, my family insisted I take a taxi. They wanted me home for dinner, and the train would have taken too long. I rode to Oakville, all the while thinking about how, in some small way, I&#8217;d made a difference in someone&#8217;s life. Someone who had never met my family, my friends, or me, had known who I was and come looking. I might not have signed any autographs, but that didn&#8217;t make the experience any less important. This is truly a day to remember. I have experienced my true 15 minutes of fame.<br />
I&#8217;m ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille&#8230;</p>

Day 15<br />
If it&#8217;s the 21st, it must be London. We can&#8217;t tell you the day of the week; we just know where we are. Cities have become our days. We ask each other: &#8220;What day is it?&#8221; The answer is: &#8220;Melville&#8221;, or &#8220;Windsor&#8221;, or &#8220;Travel&#8221;. You could come up to us and say &#8220;today is Thursday&#8221;, and we&#8217;ll just nod our heads.<br />
London is the first event that&#8217;s not really our event. It&#8217;s actually VIA&#8217;s. VIA is promoting their new Renaissance trains throughout the Montreal-Windsor corridor. We have a P42 and a six-car renaissance car consist as part of our train. We separate the trains when we come to a station.<br />
This was another minimalist event &#8212; no tents, no kiosks. The museum was open, the Boutique and the Information desk were set up in the tunnel from the station to Tracks 2 and 3. There&#8217;s nothing like a captive audience.<br />
At first, we thought the day would be a write-off. People were coming to see VIA &#8212; we hadn&#8217;t advertised our presence in London. But as morning became afternoon, more and more people came out to see us. For about an hour, we had a line-up at the Information desk at least 50 people long! It took three people to madly stuff items into the gift bags for the visitors. One thing I&#8217;ll give Londoners: They&#8217;re very polite, and very patient.<br />
People streamed in steadily all day. Almost all of them signed their names and comments in our guest book. A few people, especially those aged about 28-40, repeatedly commented on the museum. &#8220;So wonderful that you brought it here&#8221;, and &#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d get to touch the Friendly Giant&#8217;s costume&#8221;. One older woman, who remembers the early days of CBC Television, simply said: &#8220;It never occurred to me that Maggie Muggins dress was coloured&#8221; (she had only ever seen the show in black and white).<br />
Although London is a smaller market for CBC Television, many of us felt we should have done a full show. We had enough people; we had great weather. The only thing we didn&#8217;t have was a great deal of space. Perhaps in hindsight, the partial event was a better idea.<br />
We did have enough space (and good weather) to lay out our tarps and tents on the platform to dry. The deluge in Windsor had left them all wet, and fairly dirty. As we wouldn&#8217;t raise all the tents again until Ottawa, we mopped them clean and let dry in the warm London sunshine. Bill S. took to swabbing the decks, so to speak. Not the sort of thing you see every day.<br />
I took a break partway through the day to do my photo run. This is when I&#8217;ll wander around the site or general area to take pictures of the event. Based on some information we&#8217;d received, I made a side trip to the Covenant Garden Market.<br />
The market is a new building, about three blocks from the train station. Inside are some wonderful stalls with fresh fruits and vegetables, delicatessen meats, cheeses of the world, and fragrant flowers. Without my own personal refrigerator, however, anything I purchased would go bad in a couple of days.<br />
By 4:00pm, the event started to slow down. The University of Western Ontario was hosting a football game that afternoon, and it probably drew a fair few people away. But that was fine with us &#8212; we had time to wrap up and pack things away. By 6:00, we were ready to leave.<br />
The trip back to Mimico was a fairly familiar one, having rode the GO Train more times than I can count. Once at Mimico, we detrained and departed either for home (for those who lived there) or to a hotel (for those of us far enough out of town, or out of province not to have a room to call home). We arrived late enough, and had an early enough start the following day, that I opted for a hotel room rather than stay the night with my family in Oakville.<br />
For the first time since we&#8217;d started on 4 September, we went our separate ways. It was an odd feeling, to say the least.</p>

Day 14<br />
So much for good weather. When I checked the weather forecast this morning, it said rain. That meant a slight different configuration in our New Media tent arrangement, and fewer people out to visit us.<br />
For the tent, two tables instead of four, six computers instead of nine, and no centre triangle. This would allow us room to let people into the tent to view the content if we had to roll the walls out when it rained.<br />
It&#8217;s a good thing we did, because it rained. A lot. Not all day, thankfully, but enough to make us a little damp. It also damped the spirits of our potential visitors. We ended up with fewer people out to see us. This was a blessing in two ways: less chance of long line-ups, and easier for us to interact with others.<br />
Most of the people I spoke to didn&#8217;t mind the rain &#8212; they liked it because it would keep the crowds away. They were ecstatic to see the museum (I have yet to meet anyone who didn&#8217;t like it), and were surprised to see all the other material we&#8217;d brought along with us. It makes me wish we could put out our full event at every stop.<br />
One other thing that helped a lot were our volunteers. We had a lot of them. They were all go-getters, willing to go that extra mile. One of the volunteers at the New Media tent, Mark, was also a local historian. While at lunch, Debbie strongly recommended that I talk with him. (I should mention that I love Debbie &#8212; she&#8217;s been watching out for me like a mom.)<br />
The VIA Rail station is not downtown Windsor &#8212; it&#8217;s in an area called Walkerville. Walkerville, in 1858, was the home of the Hiram Walker and Sons Distillery. It was a company town, with appointed mayors and officials. The town serviced the needs of its sole employer, the distillery. The company built row housing for employees, and mansions for its management. At the centre, against the banks of the St. Clair River, is the distillery.<br />
The neighbourhood still exists today, though it is decidedly more upscale than in its past. The row houses are well-kept, and probably well sought after. The larger houses are still here, too, including the large mansion built by Hiram&#8217;s sons. (Hiram himself lived in Detroit.)<br />
Shortly before our dinner break, my partner Debbie (like I said, she&#8217;s my Guardian Angel) got me the opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes tour of the new VIA Renaissance equipment. Analisa tagged along when she heard that we&#8217;d be climbing into the locomotives. This was courtesy of John, our new train rider. (John took over for Peter when we got to Mimico.) Like Peter, John&#8217;s a train fanatic, which is why he still loves his job.<br />
John took Analisa and I first into #6403, the CBC F40PH-2. This was the same locomotive Peter had guided me through in Melville. After a brief stop, we climbed into the new P42. It&#8217;s like climbing into the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. I&#8217;m used to the valves, knobs, and gauges of steam locomotives. The computerized console of a P42 is something almost foreign to me. And I&#8217;m a member of the digerati!<br />
A standard VIA P42 diesel electric locomotive (which are almost the same as Amtrak P42s) has five computers to keep the unit running. If these crash, the locomotive doesn&#8217;t work. But you can control virtually any aspect of the locomotive, and record every last shred of information about the locomotive&#8217;s operation. I still prefer a firebox to a diesel engine.<br />
Then John took us through the Renaissance cars. These were originally European passenger cars built in England. When the order fell through, the cars remained undelivered. Transportation company GEC Alstom stepped in, bought the entire load, and then resold them to VIA. After some modifications to bring them to North American standards, VIA will put them into use in the Windsor-Montreal corridor, and on the Ocean train.<br />
The coach could be right out of a slightly more futuristic airplane. The seating, the layout &#8212; all you needed was a pair of wings out the windows, and you couldn&#8217;t really tell. The sleeper cars were significantly different, though. Many of the rooms (the deluxe rooms in particular) have showers, toilets, and sinks. It&#8217;s quite impressive. The space is small though, and I think they lack the charm and personality of the stainless steel Budd equipment that we&#8217;re using on our trip.<br />
Rain hit us hard a couple of times during the day, but rarely for more than 10 minutes. For most of the afternoon, it was relatively nice. Right up until we started to strike the sets, barely a minute after the computers had been loaded onto the train. I don&#8217;t think Noah had to content with that heavy a downpour.<br />
All of us got wet. Actually, &#8220;wet&#8221; isn&#8217;t quite right. &#8220;Thoroughly soaked to the bone&#8221; is a little more accurate. And &#8220;all&#8221; isn&#8217;t entirely correct, either. Some of us took shelter under partially collapsed tents. Some of us, including myself, didn&#8217;t care. We just plugged away at our job, just wishing that we had a bar of soap so we could make full use of the shower. The rain wasn&#8217;t too cold, so we didn&#8217;t freeze.<br />
Despite the weather, we managed to pack up in less than two hours. In fact, it took us less time to pack than it did for VIA to remarshall the train and depart. This should have driven us crazy, but merely annoyed us. The biggest problem was that the internal power had to be shut off while we waited. We watched the full length of &#8220;Shrek&#8221; in the Bullet Lounge of the Banff Park before power came back on (oh, the joys of battery-powered laptops).<br />
Next stop: London!</p>

Day 13<br />
Today was primarily a travel day. Awaking to the rising sun of the smog-filled sky of Toronto, I bade farewell to the VIA crew who had brought us from Winnipeg. It was time to welcome a new crew. Today, we also said goodbye to Jeannine and Peter, who return to Vancouver. (Peter, who has been sick for the last two days, has been uttering almost nothing but &#8220;home&#8221; since leaving Winnipeg.) We also gained a new person this morning: Trish, who&#8217;ll finally supply the support Cliff has desperately needed in Sports.<br />
We already miss our Vancouver crew terribly. They were great people, who enjoyed having fun as much as we do. Our newer crews seem a little more green, a little more by-the-books. Maybe in time we&#8217;ll be able to break them.<br />
During the night, VIA had attached a second train to ours &#8212; a new VIA Renaissance consist that we would tow from Toronto to Windsor and back, and all the way out to Quebec City. VIA is actively promoting these new trains, especially in the Southern Ontario / Southern Quebec corridor. At our next six stops, the VIA&#8217;s train will be promoted alongside ours.<br />
We departed VIA&#8217;s Toronto Maintenance Centre just after 9:00am. We backed up east of the Mimico GO station, and began our first trip west. For the next 20 minutes, we travelled along a rail line I knew well &#8212; CN&#8217;s Oakville subdivision. Living in Oakville most of my life, and having taken the GO Train for more years than I can remember, I knew the line quite well. It was a different experience seeing it from the dome of a VIA Skyline car.<br />
Richard Homme, the bassist from Frank Leahy&#8217;s band, was waiting in Oakville. Although we didn&#8217;t see him, he saw us. At least that&#8217;s what he told me in an email I got this evening. If nothing else, the fact that a well-known member of Canada&#8217;s musical and cultural scene will keep in touch with us is a sign of how well our team has worked.<br />
Leaving the Oakville Subdivision, we entered onto the Dundas Subdivision. I&#8217;ve never been out this far on a train, at least in memory. I vaguely remember a day when my mom, sister, and I travelled to London on VIA to visit with my father, who was working in London at the time. I remember nothing of the trip itself. To travel the distance again was not only gratifying, but helped restore a memory long forgotten.<br />
We zipped through London and entered the Chatham subdivision for Windsor. We thought we might arrive early &#8212; about 15:00. We thought we&#8217;d have lots of time for setting up and shuttling to the hotel (several of us were in desperate need to do laundry).<br />
How wrong we would be.<br />
My copy of the 2002 Canadian Trackside Guide doesn&#8217;t mention any sidings on the Chatham subdivision. In fact, there are a few. I know this because we sat in one for at least an hour. For no apparent reason. This had a few of our group a little agitated. But no more so than when we got to Windsor. Already running late according to our travel schedule, we were also pushing the limits of having the museum ready for its 18:30 show.<br />
Then the real grief began. We first had to wye the train (that&#8217;s railroadese for turning it around). Not too hard &#8212; there&#8217;s a wye about four kilometres from the station. That was easy. But those last four kilometres took forever to cross. The slow progress was making us lose our collective minds.<br />
Things got worse when we finally got close to the station. VIA detached the Renaissance consist, then backed our train in. (That&#8217;s actually the short version. VIA paid so much attention to their Renaissance train that sometimes I felt like we were being ignored.) We had hoped that we would be able to take our equipment off the coach car (also known as our office) before the rest of the train was moved to an inaccessible location. Next thing we knew, the front half of the train was pulling away.<br />
After managing to quickly pull the train back in to remove our equipment, we proceeded to start unloading for the shows. We have two in Windsor: one tonight for VIPs, and another tomorrow for the public. As soon as we had enough set up to open the museum, we started to pitch tents for tomorrow.<br />
We had hoped to set up tents, kiosks, and all the difficult stuff. We only got as far as tents. Rolling thunder and sheet lightning made us decide otherwise, and we packed it in after the tent flags were flapping in the stiffening wind. It rained torrentially on our way to the hotel.<br />
While most of the others went for dinner, Stefani and I opted for laundry. We were out of clean clothes (I had a pair of swim trunks and a sweatshirt left). The hotel had one washer and dryer. Why hotels have only one baffles me. The Vancouver hotel had three! It also means you spend a lot of time waiting, which was exactly what happened to me.<br />
Stefani beat me to the washing machine. No big deal &#8212; she offered to call me and let me know when she was going to remove her things so I could use it. True to her word, I got a phone call just as I hopped out of the shower. I hastily gathered my things and was just about to go out the door when the phone rang again. Some woman had decided that waiting in turn didn&#8217;t apply to her, and filled the washing machines with her shoes. I finally got in after the (rather odd) woman removed her runners and left. Cliff and Tracy started after me, and even popped in two more loonies when my jeans failed to dry completely.<br />
Tomorrow is the full public event. Our fingers are crossed for good weather and nice people. Though nice people would be enough.</p>

Day 12<br />
Last night was long. I rode in the Skyline dome with Angela, Tracy, Roger, Cliff, Debbie, and Marc until we arrived at Oba. By then, only Angela, Tracy, Marc, and myself remained. We switched onto the Algoma Central, crossed the diamond and began our trip south. An hour later, I was the only one watching the train&#8217;s journey.<br />
I&#8217;ve always wanted to ride the Algoma Central, particularly in the autumn. Sadly, it was not yet time for the trees to turn, and it was in the middle of the night. Yet I sat there, staring into the night, only able to see what the locomotive&#8217;s headlight illuminated far ahead of me.<br />
As much as I hate to admit it, I think I was depressed. This group feels like a family to me, yet there are times I feel strangely isolated. I know I&#8217;m not being actively excluded &#8212; it&#8217;s probably me not being a CBC employee. I&#8217;m a contractor. Everyone else has the commonality of actually being there. They can talk about certain people, they can talk about places or events. I can only listen. I guess I&#8217;ll always have that outside feeling.<br />
I retired to bed before I stayed up all night. The last thing I want to get caught up in is the spiralling dismay at a lack of a relationship or lose hope in the future.<br />
I awoke at mile 54 of Canadian Pacific&#8217;s Nemegos subdivision. During the night, we were held up at Franz awaiting clearance to proceed. We were running late. Originally, we were to arrive at Capreol in the mid-morning. Now we were aiming for arrival in Sudbury around 11:45. That left barely an hour to set ourselves up for the event.<br />
The delay had a benefit &#8212; we got to see more of Northern Ontario. Steam rose from lakes warming in the early morning sun. Trees grew impossibly from billion year-old rock. You could almost hear the call of the loons through the windows.<br />
It reminded me suddenly of a National Film Board short called &#8220;A Rail Trip West&#8221;, featuring silent legend Buster Keaton. Although years since my last viewing, I could remember Keaton&#8217;s character climbing into a speeder (which was used to inspect rail lines) and travelling all the way to Vancouver. The movie fascinated me as a child, and ever since I&#8217;d wanted to travel the country by rail. This trip has largely fulfilled that desire.<br />
As we got closer to Sudbury, the fog lifted and the clouds began to part. It was like coming out of a dream. All yesterday, we&#8217;d dreamed and rested. Now we were coming back to reality, and the purpose of our cross-country expedition.<br />
Arriving for our updated time, we immediately proceeded to set up for our partial event. Having a platform made things significantly easier &#8212; we didn&#8217;t need an elaborate rig of boxes and shims as we&#8217;d had in Melville. In just under an hour, the museum, part of the Boutique, and the Information desk were ready.<br />
People were already there. And people kept coming for the entire four hours. It was a steady flow, mostly of older people until the schools got out. People were nice, friendly, and happy to come down to see us. There wasn&#8217;t one disparaging comment the entire afternoon, even when we had to tell a family of four that we&#8217;d closed for the day, and were preparing to leave. This was the stop we needed.<br />
Fairly early in, I decided I needed to get pictures of Sudbury&#8217;s famous Giant Nickel. Only problem was, I didn&#8217;t know where it was. So I asked the VIA station staff. One of them kindly offered to give me a lift to see it (the distance wasn&#8217;t easily covered on foot). I grabbed Daryl, since I was reasonably sure he&#8217;d want to get the Nickel on video. The three of us hopped in a car and off we went. The man, probably in his early 20s, was perhaps the single worst stereotype of male chauvinist pig that I&#8217;ve ever seen. I actually felt embarrassed being in the car with him. (Anyone who leans out the car window, while driving, and shouts &#8220;Hey baby!&#8221; while passing attractive women really needs to be removed from the gene pool.)<br />
At least Daryl and I got footage of the Nickel.<br />
CBC Radio was roaming around doing interviews with several of the crew. I was interviewed twice &#8212; once by a woman (whose name and radio station I now sadly forget), and once by the Points North show, for CBC Radio One in Sudbury. It was a short interview, and mostly about the ShowVote program. It was my two minutes and thirty seconds minutes of fame.<br />
Five minutes before 19:00, we pulled out for our journey to Toronto. We sat, ate roast boar stuffed with venison (we somehow snagged one of the Silver and Blue chefs, who has spoiled us rotten since leaving Winnipeg &#8212; not that I&#8217;m complaining), and watched the scenery slowly slip into blackness.<br />
Around 22:00, we started to gather in the Park car. The official intent was to play Pictionary. The unofficial reason was to say goodbye to the Service Manager who&#8217;d been with us since Vancouver, Jeannine. She had been our mother, best friend, assistant, and guide over the last 12 days. We were sad to see her go.<br />
Presented with a token of our esteem, a book (which we&#8217;ll all sign), a hat, and a sweatshirt from the Boutique, we also indulged in a forbidden pleasure: drinking on the train. Jeannine joined in, even though it was more of a no-no for her than for us. We, of course, won&#8217;t tell anyone.<br />
I eventually returned to the dome of the Skyline to watch our approach into Toronto. Soon, things became recognizable: the Oriole GO station at Leslie and the 401, the Don Valley Parkway, Pottery Road, the Bloor Viaduct, and finally, downtown Toronto and the CN Tower. It felt a little like home.</p>

Day 11<br />
And on the 11th day, they rested.<br />
I awoke as the train pulled into Sioux Lookout, ON. This isolated town is the launching point for excursions into the north, and for sportsmen heading out for fishing and hunting expeditions. It&#8217;s also a divisional point on CN &#8212; we were again changing engineers.<br />
Gerry&#8217;s father-in-law hailed from Sioux Lookout, and Gerry has some ties to the town. No sooner than we arrived, he dove out to find a church to which the family had donated stained glass windows. I sufficed with photographs from the train.<br />
The train pulled out not long after I&#8217;d finished breakfast, on our way to the next divisional point, Armstrong. I took up residence in the dome for a while to watch the scenery before I realized I was about to fall asleep. I returned to my lower berth for some additional rest. At around 11:15, 139 miles further down the line, we pulled in for train orders. I felt more awake than I had in days.<br />
The battle for the shower began about two minutes out of Armstrong. Ingrid, Stefani, and I all wanted in. Somehow, though I had been waiting longer than the other two, I ended up going last. There was probably some chivalristic thing going on, but it was probably that fighting over something that trivial only succeeds in making people angry.<br />
[I should note that a couple of days later, I found out that I&#8217;m a hipocrite. Earlier in the trip, Emma and I had run into a similar situation. I can&#8217;t honestly remember doing this, so either I was completely out of my mind &#8212; a plausible situation &#8212; or I was being a jerk. I jumped into the shower ahead of Emma after she&#8217;d declared that she needed one. How chivalristic of me&#8230;]<br />
The day passed wonderfully slow. We talked, slept, ate, napped, read, rested, and didn&#8217;t think about what was coming next. It was a day spent doing nothing but watching relaxing scenery and goofing off. Our first true day off since we started two weeks ago.<br />
I sat watching out windows. The scenery up here is gorgeous. &#8220;Ontario&#8221; means &#8220;Land of Shining Waters&#8221;, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. I couldn&#8217;t hope to count the number of lakes we passed between Armstrong and Hornepayne. The trees screened the lakes, a slow tantalizing reveal as we moved along. As I stared at the near-blur of trees, it became a kind of strange martial art.<br />
Xen and the Art of Passing Trees. As the tree passes, look at its shape, it&#8217;s colour. How does it differ from those around it? Is it attractive? Is it happy? Does it look healthy? Would the tree be a good friend, or an enemy? As you contemplate the tree, can you see the forest behind it?<br />
We arrived in Hornepayne around 19:15. Another divisional point, it still retains some remnants of its former railway glory: the coaling tower and an engine house. Here we expected to leave for Capreol, where I had hoped to take pictures of ex-CNR steam locomotive #6077. It&#8217;s a sister locomotive to the Rocky Mountain Rail Society&#8217;s #6060, one I work on as frequently as I&#8217;m able.<br />
It seems fate, however, is not on my side today. A derailment on the CN line has blocked our exit. As of 22:44, as I write this, we are still in Hornepayne. Although the plan is not yet entirely clear to me, we are to continue to Oba, south to Franz along the Algoma Central, and then along CP to Sudbury. We completely bypass Capreol. #6077 will have to wait.</p>

Day 10<br />
It&#8217;s hard to say much about today that&#8217;s positive.<br />
We could analyze the events of the day to try and determine what went wrong. The exercise would be fruitless and pointless, except to determine what not to do next time. Not enough space, too many people, combined with poor local organization and a train location that proved to be nothing short of a nightmare led to a disasterous show. We had a lot of happy people, but far too many unhappy ones &#8212; and they were usually us.<br />
We love running this show across Canada. Sure, we&#8217;ve had rough times and stops that we didn&#8217;t think were great. But never before as this team been so entirely upset about trying their best and being told it isn&#8217;t enough. It was disheartening to be berated by patrons and even volunteers who don&#8217;t know how much sweat and tears that has been spilled since the start. It was enough for us to want to close down early and run screaming.<br />
Although we suspected from yesterday that Winnipeg would be hard, I don&#8217;t think any of us thought that Winnipeg would be our Waterloo.<br />
It all began just after noon, when the schools started arriving. From 12:00 to 15:00, we would run group tours (in other words, schools) through the museum. This also meant, of course, all our other exhibits.<br />
The Boutique and New Media were in the rotunda of Union Station, along with Radio-Canada and a production set for a live broadcast starting around 16:00. It was cramped, but bearable. Throw in a few hundred children, and cramped becomes contemptible.<br />
I remember being a student. I remember field trips. We were bloody murder on teachers. But I also remember having some serious strict discipline if we ever got out too far out of line. Most of the CBC crew remember that. Either we were being too critical, or a large number of the children who came were complete terrors. To the point where hidden keyboards were pulled out, computers almost hacked (we had to keep a very close eye), and children who almost ruined the Friendly Giant&#8217;s costume in the museum.<br />
The chaos in the rotunda came nowhere near the level of mayhem in the back parking lot. Sports, News, and Children&#8217;s tents were under siege from a thousand hands, all wanting something. Few thank-yous were heard, almost no eye contact, and virtually no interaction. At times, it was like watching piranhas strip a body to its skeleton. None of the tents had volunteers. We were on our own.<br />
Things went from worse to terrible. Apparently, one of the schools had disadvantaged children. On such child had anger issues. He hit Franklin, hard enough to crack the helmet inside the head. Luckily, the volunteer wasn&#8217;t injured, but the damage was done. Emma was beside herself &#8212; how on earth could a child like that be allowed to attend something like this? How Emma made it through the day without screaming (or a few stiff shots of scotch) is amazing.<br />
By 15:00, we were all ready to pack up and leave. But people had already started arriving for the public event. We still had five hours to endure. We held hope that it was just the children, and that the public would be more understanding. To a degree, they were. But the temperamental individuals more than made up for the nice people.<br />
Barely an hour into the show, one of the volunteers in the rotunda &#8212; an elderly man &#8212; came up to me and asked who ran the show. A bit of a vague question, I asked for clarity. He then asked who ran the museum. The answer was Ivan. The man offered a suggestion on how to improve things. My &#8220;Danger Will Robinson, Danger!&#8221; alarm went off immediately. I took a chance and asked what his idea was.<br />
&#8220;Move the train.&#8221;<br />
The man had a valid point. The train was parked in a very awkward location, making it difficult for people to get to it. But that was the best we could do &#8212; we didn&#8217;t have a lot of options to play with. Such was the nature of the site. I tried my best to defuse the man&#8217;s insistence, offering the thought that this situation had been addressed a lot in the last few weeks, and this was the best we could do. My suggestion fell on deaf ears, and the man pronounced that he was going to do something about it.<br />
&#8220;Geoff to Julie, urgent!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Go for Julie.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I need you in the rotunda, ASAP.&#8221;<br />
I never knew humans could turn such an interesting shade of red. Had Julie been a more predatory animal, say a lion, I&#8217;m sure she would have taken the man&#8217;s head off. He was encouraged to leave immediately. He lingered a while longer, complaining and pointing at me &#8230; but soon he was gone and it was one less problem to deal with. But when you&#8217;re having a day full of problems, one less problem doesn&#8217;t really do much.<br />
Neil, Julie, and Debbie were the breakwaters against the hurricane of trouble. How they got through the day without either breaking down or blowing up I cannot fathom. I watched as one person decided to cut deeply into Neil, claiming false advertising when the tickets to the museum all sold out before she arrived. I felt for him. I can&#8217;t imagine how much that must have hurt.<br />
In our larger venues, we give out tickets to the museum. This is to control the flow of visitors. We&#8217;ve had a few complaints about it &#8212; why don&#8217;t we just let people fend for themselves? The answer is easy: fewer people will get through the museum, and we&#8217;ll have more angry people who didn&#8217;t make it in. At least this way, we can manage the crowd, and let people know that they won&#8217;t get in.<br />
Probably the single biggest issue was the local organizer, Raydene (or maybe Raylene &#8230; like it matters, we know it&#8217;s just a pseudonym for &#8220;Satan&#8221;). This woman was supposed to have organized everything in the area, so we could concentrate on what was going on. But she didn&#8217;t organize anything, it seemed. Volunteers disappeared regularly, didn&#8217;t show up when we thought they were supposed to, she didn&#8217;t allow for feeding the volunteers or provide water, and we heard things like this all day over the walkie-talkies, never hearding the expected responses:<br />
&#8220;Debbie to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Neil to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Analisa to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Emma to Raydene.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Julie to Raydene&#8230;&#8221; [said while spitting fire through gritted teeth]<br />
As the day progressed, we started making plans for packing up. This was going to be a stash-n-dash. This was our shortest pack time, and has been worrying us since Vancouver. We had a short period of time to strike our sets and pack everything up. This concerned me a lot, because the New Media kiosks take a while to pack up. But our Fearless Leaders had a plan.<br />
Sports, News, and Children&#8217;s tents would come down at 19:00, an hour early. At 20:00, New Media and Boutique would strike. The theory was that by 20:00, the other three tents would be packed, and everyone would help strike the remaining two. (It was also loosely necessary because of the live broadcast that went on right next to our two displays &#8212; we had to wait to do our packing job.) It gave me a bit of pause, but I put faith in the plan. At that point, faith was about all I had left.<br />
The last two hours in the rotunda were the worst. All day, bright spotlights had made the temperature soar. Starting around 17:30, hundreds started to filter into the rotunda to watch the live broadcast. It started to get warmer. The small space caused further problems &#8212; everyone had to pack in tight. This rendered both Boutique and New Media almost inaccessible. This was both a blessing (fewer things to watch for) and a curse (couldn&#8217;t keep an eye on what was happening).<br />
Just before 19:00, the radio chatter started. The tents outside were coming down, and instructions aplenty bantered back and forth. The mood over the radio had changed. Earlier in the day, it had been tired, distraught, even tense. Now it was driven, determined, and focused. The end was in sight, and everyone wanted out.<br />
At 19:30, Debbie and I started to close down New Media. It was time to close out another ShowVote category. By 19:50, the six computers featuring ShowVote were off. We were disconnecting cords, wrapping up cables, and preparing for the imminent rush.<br />
It was now really tight. The broadcast (now featuring Fred Penner) had shifted to the celebration, including the largest birthday cake I&#8217;ve ever seen. It was wheeled in right between New Media and the Boutique, cramming people against both booths. Although the broadcast finished just after 20:00, we had a serious people problem &#8212; people were leaving too slowly.<br />
The rest of the team arrived, armed and ready to help. Tabletops were removed, computers packed, tables flattened. The screwgun arrived and the centre triangle came down. The monitor boxes contained within the triangle were rapidly filled with monitors, and the plasma screen packed away. Over at the Boutique, unsold merchandise returned to their respective boxes, taped up, and loaded on a VIA luggage cart. Within 30 minutes, we had taken down both booths.<br />
Luckily, the crowd had filtered out when we started to haul things upstairs. When we&#8217;d set up on Sunday, the freight elevators were trouble. We were a little worried that they would slow us down, or worse, malfunction. Instead, they probably saved us a great deal of time. The process worked so well, we finished by 21:20, a full 40 minutes ahead of our departure time.<br />
Neil, Emma, and Rose were on their way back to Toronto. None of them were leaving us permanently. Rose has a lot of business to handle, and will rejoin us in Windsor. Neil and Emma need to see their families, and tackle pressing issues. Both will return when we do our Toronto show on the 22nd.<br />
I ate a dinner I originally didn&#8217;t want. I was far to stressed and tired to be hungry, but Debbie convinced me to eat. I took a table right next to CBC celebrities Ian Hanomansing, Diane Swain, Peter Jordon, and another woman who was a radio personality (unfortunately, I&#8217;m not well up on my CBC radio names). I was so tired I didn&#8217;t even notice they were there. It wasn&#8217;t until I heard Ian&#8217;s voice that I realized who was behind me.<br />
We were exhausted, mentally, physically, and emotionally. We all needed showers and about two days&#8217; sleep. We wanted to leave. We had to wait. We needed a new locomotive.<br />
Our train has two diesel electric locomotives: #6403, which is our CBC-decaled lead locomotive, and #6412, a second VIA locomotive that&#8217;s mostly backup. We lost #6412 outside of Biggar when the crankcase exploded. (That&#8217;s why you have a backup.) We had to pick up another locomotive before tackling northern Ontario. It&#8217;s a long ride, and you don&#8217;t want to cross it solo.<br />
Taking #6412&#8217;s place was #6449. It had come in on the #2 train the day before (eastbound Canadian), pulled off due to mechanical failure. Repaired, it was turned over to us. Once the both engines were fuelled, they were reattached and air brakes tested.<br />
I was in the Skyline&#8217;s dome when the train started forward. There was a sudden overwhelming rush of relief as we pulled out of the station. While I had been excited to come to Winnipeg, like everyone else I was ecstatic to depart.<br />
Almost instantly, people began to slowly unwind. Some went directly to bed. Others sat and watched the dark scenery pass. The train was quiet, save for the blats of #6403&#8217;s horn, and the clanking of the train as we rolled along.</p>

Day 9<br />
We arrived in Winnipeg somewhere around 05:00. I use the vagueness because I&#8217;m not entirely sure. I was quite tired, and still don&#8217;t know what possessed me to open the window and look. When I saw us arriving at Union Station, I returned to my slumber.<br />
The sounds of activity eventually pulled me from bed, and into action. Though that was mostly due to my bladder. Unfortunately, Winnipeg was our first stop without honeypots (the large barrels that collected human waste from the toilets). We had to hike into the station and track down the bathrooms in there. Fortunately, Winnipeg&#8217;s Union Station isn&#8217;t like Toronto&#8217;s &#8212; no steady stream of passengers to see us so dishevelled first thing in the morning.<br />
Breakfast soon woke me up, just in time to meet our new crew member. Today, CJ finished her time with us. We gain Debbie in her place. I am sorry to see CJ leave. Although we started off on the wrong foot, we ended good partners. I look forward to seeing her in Toronto. We&#8217;ve also gained a replacement for Enza&#8217;s position: Ingrid. In a way, I kind of feel bad for her &#8212; I hear a lot of &#8220;I miss Enza&#8221;. It&#8217;s not directed at Ingrid, but she does have a legacy to live up to.<br />
CJ wasn&#8217;t the only person leaving. This morning&#8217;s breakfast would be the last for our entire initial crew (not counting [[CBC TV 50th Anniversary VIA Rail train, Remembering 9/11|Enza&#8217;s departure]] five days ago). Today is the first rotation of personnel. Most of the VIA crew rotates out here, with only Peter and Jeanine carrying through to Toronto. Perhaps the most depressing part for many people is that the band is also leaving. Due to prior engagements, Frank has to leave us here. Frank, David, Paul, and Richard all want to stay on board, and at one point tried to rearrange their schedules to see where they could come back. We will see them again, but probably not on the train.<br />
In commemoration of the crew change, we took a full cast photo in the rotunda, including the VIA staff. It was a sad affair, as we said goodbye to new friends and comrades. It&#8217;s been a great week &#8212; I can&#8217;t wait to see what the next weeks bring us.<br />
Following breakfast, I took a wander around the station. Everyone I know from the Winnipeg area has been telling me for a while that I needed to see Union Station. They were right &#8212; it&#8217;s quite beautiful. Originally opened in 1911 by the Grand Trunk Pacific and Canadian Northern railroads, Winnipeg&#8217;s Union Station is a shining example of Beaux Arts architectural style. (And if you&#8217;re wondering, I got that snippet from a plaque hung on the wall.)<br />
Of particular note is the rotunda. This large room has welcomed countless waves of immigrants and visitors to Winnipeg, it&#8217;s cavernous ceiling alluding to the wonders that await beyond the doors. Aside from cracks in the rotunda floor, the building has survived the years well. The cracks stem from the platoons of soldiers who marched through this station in the 1940s. Their combined weight and rhythmic step caused the floor to flex and break.<br />
Also of note is the railway museum on Track 1. When railway traffic declined in Canada, Winnipeg was left with a mostly-empty station. (Toronto&#8217;s Union Station became a commuter rail hub.) The unused space was rented to Winnipeg Railway Museum. They brought in their vintage equipment including the Countess of Dufferin, the first locomotive in northwestern Canada. I know this because one of the VIA staff had a key to the door and let me in. I just had to be quiet and quick, so the museum staff wouldn&#8217;t catch me in there.<br />
Today&#8217;s event was for Winnipeg CBC employees. A lighter load for some of us, it still required a full setup. This was the hard part. It was our first multi-level setup &#8212; the train is on the second floor of the station. Our equipment went either to the rear parking lot or to the rotunda, both underneath. It took nearly twice as long to set up as usual. I tried to show Debbie what CJ and I have figured out over the last week, so she&#8217;ll have fewer bruises. But with the nature of our layouts, things always happen.<br />
The setup was far from perfect. It took a long time to get equipment downstairs, mostly due to a sudden breakdown of the freight elevator. This stranded Neil and Cliff for the better part of an hour, along with a cart full of equipment destined for the rotunda.<br />
By roughly 14:00, the New Media area was complete, and it was time to break for the hotel. I desperately needed a shower. With the on-train services suspended in the station, and several hours of labour, I felt a little more dirty than I cared to admit.<br />
Before we left, a small group of us took lunch at a hamburger stand across the road. Angela had sworn these were the best hamburgers to be had. They were tasty, indeed, and most importantly filled the hole that had since formed in my belly.<br />
Again, our hotel was way out in the middle of nowhere. This isn&#8217;t CBC&#8217;s fault &#8212; I can only assume it&#8217;s Holiday Inn (when you get free rooms, you get what you&#8217;re given). We&#8217;ve had one hotel downtown: Vancouver. The others have been substantial drives from the train and from downtown. (Although in Saskatoon, we were reasonably close to good restaurants and nightclubs.)<br />
Clean again, I returned to the station to explore a bit. I caught a cab with Daryl &#8212; he went for lunch, and I went down to The Forks. The Forks is old railways land just to the east of Union Station. Back in the Golden Age of railroads, this was CN&#8217;s yard in the downtown. Roundhouse, ice house, car shop &#8212; it was all here. (It&#8217;s now in the Transcona Yard to the east of the city.) The Forks is now trendy area of downtown with parkland, restaurants, and shops.<br />
CN and CP had a great ability to always choose the best land in town. In many other cities, the abandoned land eventually came very expensive condos, golf courses, or sports stadiums. Winnipeg had enough sense to make it into parkland and public places. They even kept the old railway lift bridge &#8212; it&#8217;s now a stationary pedestrian bridge.<br />
The event was dead. Cemeteries see more life than the New Media booth did. Sadly, the other booths outside and the museum were hammered with visitors. We assumed it was because the free food was out there. We noticed one thing that did worry us &#8212; the people seemed a bit testy. Western Canadians are general an agreeable folk, who are generally easy-going. These people seemed itching to take someone&#8217;s head off. We shall see tomorrow if that continues.<br />
When closing time arrived, we didn&#8217;t pack up. Because we&#8217;re setting up in the same location tomorrow, all we had to do was turn everything off. The tents outside brought the expensive items indoors, and walled off the booths. Back to the hotel, a brief beverage in the lounge, and we were off to bed. We need all the sleep we can get. Based on how today went, tomorrow will be a long day.</p>
