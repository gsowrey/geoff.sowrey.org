		<p>T-minus 3 days<br />
I awoke with my alarm ready for a day of discovery. That was important because I had only met three people in the crew of 30-odd. When I arrived in the restaurant for breakfast, I stared at a seemingly endless sea of unfamiliar faces. I ate breakfast alone, partly because I still have a weird shyness complex, and also because I needed to review my notes. (If anyone asks, I&#8217;m sticking with the latter reason.)<br />
Walking into this entire affair, I&#8217;d had many questions and concerns. I had many reservations. I didn&#8217;t know whom I could rely on for help. Over the last two months, I came to know the management of this project. With that familiarity came comfort that things were under control. Today just reinforced that.<br />
I boarded the shuttle to Pacific Central station, barely knowing a person. I didn&#8217;t even know who my tent-mate was. I had talked to her on the phone, but you really don&#8217;t get an impression for them with a short conversation. We had work to do, and all I could do was just follow the crowd and fill in the blanks as I went along.<br />
The first big help was courtesy of Ivan, the Museum curator. He had made name tags for everyone in the crew so we wouldn&#8217;t have so much trouble with names. (And also so guests would know who were are.) Besides, &#8220;Hi My Name Is&#8221; stickers look a little goofy.<br />
We started off slowly &#8212; there was little we could do until VIA switched our train (or as much of it as was available) into the station so we could start unloading our stuff. Everyone milled. Some people knew others, but many (like myself) were total strangers. I figured out who Daryl was early on &#8212; he had the video camera. Ivan and I met in the opening stages, as well, learning that we were both part of historical rail societies.<br />
This was our first practical introduction to everything we have to work with over the next 37 days. Some of us had attended a meeting in Toronto a couple of weeks earlier that included basics with the tent. I saw a video. So actually getting a chance to fully set the equipment up was not only important, but helpful.<br />
I had never been on VIA&#8217;s Budd cars before. (These are the stainless steel passenger cars most visible on The Canadian.) Formerly of the Canadian Pacific Railway, VIA inherited the cars when taking over passenger service in Canada. As we wandered through the cars, it suddenly became real. This was really happening.<br />
For the last two months, I was living in a bit of a daze. When Brenda had approached me with this project, I felt like someone had a conduit into my dreams. Though I was active in planning and development, I still felt separated. Now I was in the thick of it. These were the people on the train. I would work and live with them for over a month. This was the train. There was no doubt any more, not even a hint of possibility. This was it.<br />
Today was my introduction to the team. I hovered rather than directly introduced, allowing time for acceptance and for adjustment. The team is going to be everything for the next month, and I want to get off on a good start. Besides, I don&#8217;t want to bombard them with the Full Geoff. (Sometimes, I&#8217;m a little much.)<br />
We set up tents in the morning. The original plan was to do full set ups and strikes (taking everything down) as many times as possible so we&#8217;d be comfortable with the system. But an unexpected arrival of the Rocky Mountaineer from Kamloops derailed us, and we had to stop.<br />
During our break, Earl (the director of VIA&#8217;s Vancouver Maintenance Centre) took us into the maintenance building to see our lead locomotive. VIA #6403, a GMD F40PH-2 diesel electric locomotive, sat in its CBC 50th Anniversary decaled glory. It sat proud, looking like a cat that had just finished cleaning itself, ready for petting.<br />
After lunch, we emptied the baggage car and made an attempt to see what we could make of the equipment. I was happy to see that all the computers and monitors had survived the trip. I was ecstatic to see that all the problems I&#8217;d seen in Toronto had been solved. Blake, one of the wunderkinds of the CBC interactive group, had worked magic that even Gandalf would not challenge.<br />
We worked the whole day, at least when we weren&#8217;t halted by a train or by some other activity that needed our attention. Tests, checks, experiments, and finally decisions. When we were done, there was a feeling of accomplishment (though a few people thought we didn&#8217;t do enough), and of confidence.<br />
Packing everything back up was a bigger challenge. Pulling things out of a baggage car is immeasurably easier than trying to get it back in again. Especially when it needs to be in a specific order. We finished around 21:30 that evening. We called it a night, retiring to the hotel for a rest. The day to come was going to be our real test.<br />
Brenda had arrived in the hotel by that time. She had come out to see how her labours were paying off. Brenda had lost countless days of sleep, and probably gained a few grey hairs working out the details for her department. Now it was time to see if it was all worth it.<br />
Running into Neil in the hotel lobby, he invited me to join him, Brenda, and several others at the bar next door for a quick drink. Brenda and I ended up talking shop the entire time. I told her what I knew. She asked more questions. But in the end, the truth wouldn&#8217;t be known until the next day.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 4 days<br />
First order of the day was to move out of Joel and Michelle&#8217;s piano room. Although I greatly appreciate their hospitality, I do need to be with the rest of the CBC. The show starts tomorrow morning.<br />
I dropped the car off at the Budget Rent-A-Car shortly after 9:00. The car was in the same shape I had received it, save for a few extra kilometres on the odometer. I cabbed it from there to the Lougheed Mall Skytrain station on the new Millennium Line (which opened for service yesterday). No sense in not taking a train when the possibility exists.<br />
The trip on the new line would have been better had I been in the new cars, but they&#8217;re not as frequent as the old ones. But a train ride is rarely bad. Arriving at the Commercial stop, I disembarked and boarded an Expo Line train for the Granville station. From there, it was a 10 minute walk down to the Holiday Inn at the corner of Howe and Helmcken.<br />
Holiday Inn was another important partner in the 50th anniversary celebrations with the CBC. They, too, are having their 50th birthday this year, and have supplied the CBC with hotel accommodations across Canada. For free.<br />
This trip gets better each and every day.<br />
I checked in, dumped off my things, and got to my second order of business: a shower. (Lugging all those things around is a fair bit of work.) Then it was time for the third thing I needed to attend to: lunch.<br />
Every time I come to Vancouver, I have lunch with my friends from Radical. When I used to work there, I would listen to them talk about the projects over Chinese food. Now I listen to them talk about projects in code, so I won&#8217;t hear anything important. The code is sometimes so vague they even stump themselves. Inevitably I can piece things together, but I&#8217;m bound by an informal disclosure agreement, not to mention respect, not to talk about it. So don&#8217;t ask.<br />
Following lunch, I bade farewell and headed towards False Creek Ferries. They&#8217;re my favourite means of transportation to Granville Island. (That, and I forgot about the trolley car.) Picture a bathtub roughly twice the normal size, with an inverted-T top. It&#8217;s small, it doesn&#8217;t move very fast, but it&#8217;s a graceful way to move around False Creek.<br />
No matter how long I&#8217;m away from Vancouver, I always try to visit Granville Island. It&#8217;s by far my favourite place in the city. The smells of fresh fruit and vegetables and breads, the taste of fresh fish, the ambiance of a large community market, and the comfort of a friend. It&#8217;s always worth a side trip.<br />
I had wanted to visit my friend Katrina during my False Creek excursion. (For those of you following the program, this is the same Katrina who had moved to California. Since then, she and her husband moved back to Vancouver, much to everyone&#8217;s delight.) Alas, I had forgotten her phone number in Calgary, and her cellular phone wasn&#8217;t on. We connected later in the day, but only by voice. We tried to make plans to get together that night, but Katrina had to pack for her trip east. Sadly, we will not meet again until later.<br />
Dinner was with Lee and her boyfriend Matt. (You might remember Lee as my &#8220;Fearless Leader&#8221; from my days with the Rad Sox softball team.) We were later joined by Neall and his girlfriend Mel. We hoped for more, but in the end fewer people make for better conversation.<br />
We started at a somewhat mediocre Indian restaurant just off Denman. My experiences with Indian cuisine on the West Coast are generally positive. This one was neutral. I wasn&#8217;t particularly thrilled, but I&#8217;ve had worse. We moved later to the Sylvia Hotel&#8217;s bar. Slightly on the tacky side, it&#8217;s also lightly travelled, and a place to spot the stars.<br />
We would not have a late night. Though tempting, we all had to work the next day. I didn&#8217;t want to be late.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 5 days<br />
Today was supposed to be tourist day. It was supposed to be sunny and warm, with nice little chirping birds and happy people out enjoying the &#8220;last day of summer&#8221;. (School starts tomorrow.)<br />
So naturally, it rained.<br />
Out here in Maple Ridge, it teemed. I hoped that by the time I got to Howe Sound that either the rain had died out, or was reduced to spittle due to the mountains.<br />
To a degree, I was right. But there was one thing I didn&#8217;t count on &#8211; traffic accidents that snarl up the Sea to Sky Highway. That pretty much ended my excursion to Britannia Mines and the West Coast Railway Association. Maybe the next trip out.<br />
The whole highway thing was a little interesting. As I sat in my rented Chrysler Neon (which I can now confidently say is a poor excuse for a car), I thought about the problem. Whistler wants to host the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. That means a lot of people driving to and from Vancouver. As it stands, the Sea to Sky Highway (also known as Highway 99) can&#8217;t handle that traffic. And in winter conditions, the next Olympic demonstration sport will be the Traffic Accident Slalom. There&#8217;s a lot of problems that the BC government will need to solve before the games start.<br />
I ended up in Horseshoe Bay. The only reason was to have Trolls&#8217; fish and chips, which I remembered quite fondly. But it was an off day, a general slump in quality, or my memory of the fish was distorted. I was not impressed. And they appeared to have taken salmon off the menu. Salmon fish and chips was a delicacy I missed.<br />
On the way back, I stopped into Lonsdale Quay in North Vancouver. The wine shop I had once been to was still there. I bought a thank you for my gracious hosts for the time and place. Besides, it was a great excuse to go wine hunting &#8211; something I never get tired of.<br />
I had dinner with Greg. It&#8217;s almost bizarre how well Greg and I get along considering how little we see of each other. We worked in the same department for a little over two years, but during those years we were more co-workers than friends. It wasn&#8217;t until I asked him for help when I moved to Calgary that things changed. Since then, he&#8217;s been a good, trusted friend.<br />
Tonight, we had more time together than our last few meetings. This allowed for a nice long steak dinner at a local Joey Tomato&#8217;s, and time to catch up on all the things that had come up in our lives over the last year.<br />
Greg&#8217;s always been an active person who strives to keep himself busy. If he&#8217;s not working, he&#8217;s rock climbing, working in the Hungarian community, or more recently, acting. Personally, I think Greg&#8217;s ideally suited to acting &#8230; for his looks, if nothing else. Hollywood stars should be jealous of him. Acting will let him extend himself past the algorithms he works with all day, and into a stronger right-brain skill set.<br />
We saw a movie following dinner (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, which I recommend highly to anyone who&#8217;s had or seen to too many nuptials in the last two years). We laughed. A lot. A part of me wishes we could have just sat down, shared drinks and talked all night. Greg and I can do that easily. But Greg had to work the next day, and I had to move to a hotel.<br />
Tomorrow is my last &#8220;free&#8221; day before the real work begins. I can&#8217;t tell if I&#8217;m excited or terrified.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 6 days<br />
Today was much quieter than the previous two days &#8230; if you don&#8217;t count two kids, that is.<br />
After waking and spending a morning with Joel and Michelle&#8217;s family, Joel showed me his new pet project. Joel is working on an addition to the Microsoft Flight Simulator, called Squawkbox. It allows virtual pilots to communicate using voice (instead of chat) with virtual air traffic controllers. It also links pilots other pilots. The end result is a simulation that is eerily close to the real thing.<br />
Joel even demonstrated the existing system. He prepared his flight from Boston. This required him to talk with the Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs) who &#8220;managed&#8221; Boston. There are two such people: Tower control, and Approach control. Although probably not even in the same city, these two people hand off control to each other, just as would happen in real life. For the end user, the experience is nothing short of completely engaging. I can see why Joel gets so excited when he talks about the system.<br />
Following our virtual fly by of Boston, Joel took me to get a car. Joel and Michelle have been most kind to give me a place to stay. However, being so far out of town, it does require me to rent a car (public transit, though preferable, isn&#8217;t really an option). It&#8217;s not as bad as it sounds. I actually like having the car. It gives me more freedom.<br />
The primary reason for the car was a local wedding reception for my friend Nigel. He&#8217;s an former coworker from Radical Entertainment (he&#8217;s still there &#8230; I&#8217;m not). Nigel married his wife, Patricia, the day after my sister and in the adjacent town. [Insert singing and dancing dolls here.]<br />
The party was held in Heritage Hall on Main St. in Vancouver. Until I was a couple of blocks away, I didn&#8217;t know the place. But as I turned onto Main St., suddenly I remembered. Nigel&#8217;s theatre group (Tempest in a Teacup) had put on a show in the basement that I&#8217;d seen a few years earlier.<br />
Not many Radicalites were out, but those who did come still work there. I still miss the company, the people, and the excitement. In the last few months, I&#8217;ve been regretting more and more having left. While I really want to go back, I doubt there is little room for me in the organization. It was a really fun place to work, and despite the hurried schedules of releasing game, Radical had an energy that Critical Mass could never hope to have.<br />
Greg and I had a long talk. It had been a long time since we&#8217;d seen each other, and we had much to discuss. (These journals don&#8217;t cover every detail of my life.) We chat very rarely, on account of how busy we are.<br />
Within a couple of hours, most of the people I knew had filtered out. Those who remained were personable, having talked with several of them before the Radicalites arrived. But I was getting tired, and had an hour drive back to Joel&#8217;s.<br />
I didn&#8217;t make it out of downtown. I tried to drive towards the east, but the lure of the city lights drew me downtown, and out to Stanley Park. An imposing feature at night (no lights inside the park), the edges offer some of the best shots of Vancouver at night. I was an hour late getting to bed.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>T-Minus 7 days<br />
Five-thirty is an unfair time of the morning. Especially if your alarm clock wakes you in the middle of a really good dream.<br />
This morning, I took a taxi to the BC Rail station and boarded the Cariboo Prospector. It&#8217;s a three-car Rail Diesel Car (RDC) passenger train that runs between Prince George and North Vancouver.<br />
(An RDC, in case you&#8217;re wondering, is a self-propelled passenger car. They were developed in the 50s by the Budd Car Company as a means for simple passenger operation without the need for an extra locomotive. For a while, RDCs were a common site in North America. Now they are a dying breed. In Canada, only BC Rail and VIA still run RDCs, and only in three places: Victoria-Courteney on Vancouver Island (VIA), Sudbury-White River in Ontario (VIA), and Prince George-North Vancouver.)<br />
This will be an important trip for me. Due to budget cuts at BC Rail, the Prospector will cease operations at the end of October. This is also true for BC Rail&#8217;s other services, the Pacific Starlight and the Whistler Northwind. The Royal Hudson service already met with an ignominious end when both 2860 and 3716 steam locomotives required maintenance. Their end came in 1999. (2860 is now on display at the West Coast Railway Association in Squamish. 3716 is stored unserviceable at BC Rail.)<br />
It is truly a shame that a service such as this would befall such a fate. While perhaps not the speediest form of transportation, it is very comfortable, and you simply can&#8217;t see this country any other way. And that&#8217;s not to count the necessity. There&#8217;s a native tribe just south of Lillooet that needs the service to get from Lillooet to their home. With the service ending, they needed to contract a shuttle with BC Rail.<br />
It&#8217;s a 15 hour trip from Prince George to North Vancouver. It&#8217;s not only a trip through some of the most beautiful country in Canada, but it&#8217;s also a test of endurance. If you can&#8217;t survive 15 hours on one day, how would you survive 33 days?<br />
This was one day I was happy to endure. The weather wasn&#8217;t the most ideal, admittedly. That didn&#8217;t take away from the majesty of our natural ecosystems or of the sculpted terrain. Though the cloudy skies did bring an early night.<br />
The trip is run as a partial tourist train. It was initially started to serve the countless little communities between the Lower Mainland and Prince George (most of them remnants from the Gold Rush). Either through evolution or through need, it soon became a partial tourist train. As the train rolls along, one of the train crew points out sights and tells some of the local history. The fact that you&#8217;re fed breakfast, lunch, and dinner as you ride is an added bonus.<br />
The only real down side of the trip is that you&#8217;re confined to your car for the duration of the journey. You aren&#8217;t allowed between cars, and most of the stops are too brief to let people off. Between Lillooet and North Vancouver, there was only one stop of sufficient length for people to stretch their legs.<br />
By the time we reached Whistler, it was darkening fast. Not far past the resort, you could barely make out silhouettes, let alone the colours or objects. The remainder of the ride to North Vancouver was quiet and uneventful. Once we entered sight of the Lions Gate Bridge, however, the lights of the night city were spectacular.<br />
My friend Joel and his wife Michelle greeted me at the station. They had offered me refuge for a few days before I started with the CBC. Though they lived nearly an hour out of downtown, the need for rest and quiet were more than appealing enough. Fifteen hours of travel isn&#8217;t physically tiring, but it is draining.</p>

		<p>T-Minus 8 days<br />
There&#8217;s nothing like trying to plan one and a half months of a chaotic life in excruciating detail. It&#8217;s a little easier when someone else does all the dirty work, but ultimately, it&#8217;s you that will make it flow smoothly.<br />
In my case, it was extracting myself from my life. Really, it was the only way to make any kind of a clean break. But in a fashion typical of myself, I still managed to be running around for the last 45 minutes of being at the office. It seems no amount of preparation can prevent that.<br />
Of course, it didn&#8217;t help that Purolator missorted my advance cheque from the CBC. That caused me to call the courier and see if I could divert it to Vancouver. I won&#8217;t know if I was successful until 4 September.<br />
On of the things I left too late was booking a hotel room. Why I left it so late is anybody&#8217;s guess (&#8216;cuz I don&#8217;t know). But it meant that I still needed to clear it up before I boarded my plane.<br />
My flight to Vancouver was its usual uneventful passage. Although I had booked a window seat, I offered it to a young girl who was flying alone and would have sat between two men. The seat was cramped, and not leather (see [[Cathy and Craig&#8217;s Wedding]]). For such a short flight, it wasn&#8217;t necessary. But it would still have been nice.<br />
My stop in Vancouver was short. I almost walked out of one terminal gate and right into the adjacent gate. All that prevented me was a 25-minute wait until the next flight started its boarding call.<br />
I was off to Prince George, &#8220;Gateway to the North&#8221; and the geographical centre of British Columbia. I had exactly the same seat booked that I would have had in the previous flight (had I not given up my window view). But this time, I wanted to see the landscape. We left early (how often that happen?). The flight was short, and soon we arrived at the smallest airport I think I&#8217;ve ever been to. Not many airports require planes to turn around on the runway to get to the terminal.<br />
The terminal building was even smaller than Hamilton&#8217;s. There&#8217;s one baggage carousel, which opens directly to the outside. There&#8217;s one gate. Now that&#8217;s small.<br />
Grabbing an airporter, I found my way to the Downtown Motel. It was, I think, the last available room in Prince George. It wasn&#8217;t the Fairmont Palliser, but it had a comfy bed at a reasonable price. (Even if the room was permeated with a deodourizer that smelled almost worse than the cigarette smoke it was supposed to cover up.)<br />
So why the shortage of rooms? After dinner at the Shogun at the Coast of the North hotel, I wandered around to take pictures. In the process, I ran into three wonderfully chatty elderly women competing in the BC Senior Games. The games are running this weekend in Prince George. Hence, no rooms.<br />
We talked a fairly long time &#8211; they were quite puzzled why I would be running around at night taking pictures. Prince George has some great vistas, including the new art gallery just west of city hall. The lighting at night really brings out the gallery&#8217;s unique construction.<br />
While I was there talking, we were approached by two of the volunteers who were helping at the games. They were wondering what we were talking about. Over the course of a shorter conversation, I found that Prince George has 26 sawmills. While an impressive-sounding number, the reality is much less impressive. Of those, only 11 or 12 are still open.<br />
Bed soon beckoned. I had a very early morning to come, and sleep was a necessity.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are times that I&#8217;m almost envious of myself. Well, okay, one time that I&#8217;m envious of myself. Hey, it&#8217;s better than being jealous of others&#8230;<br />
I&#8217;m going on a train trip. But not any train trip. In fact, this falls into the &#8220;Once an Orbit of Pluto&#8221; category. And it all started when I read the following in a reply from my friend Brenda:<br />
&#8220;hey if the cbc sent a train from coast to coast for 38 days of travel and events in september/october for its 50th anniversary celebrations, would you like to go to document the trip/take pictures/take video/set up (take down) kiosks at events/chat with the public/hang out with cbc celebrities?&#8221;<br />
I actually fell back in my chair, staring at what I&#8217;d just read. I looked all around for any sign of Allen Funt&#8217;s descendants. I pinched, splashed cold water, and tried to wake up, just to be safe. My reply was something along the lines of:<br />
&#8220;How many limbs and first-born children do you want?&#8221;<br />
Brenda, if you haven&#8217;t already guessed, works at the CBC. She got handed this project, and was in the process of trying to get it back on track. (Yes, it&#8217;s a pun. Deal with it.) This spun off a long string of emails of questions, more than should be asked of a single person. But in short order, we&#8217;d determined what was going to happen.<br />
Well, almost. First I had one minor detail to contend with: Getting time off work.<br />
Over the last two years, I&#8217;ve managed to weasel my way into a position/role of far too much responsibility and pseudo-authority. My first initial thought was that I would have to go back to Brenda and regretfully decline. But it never hurts to ask.<br />
So the day my boss returned from his honeymoon, I pulled him into a meeting room, and delivered the following speech.<br />
Me: First off, I&#8217;m not quitting.<br />
Him: (Either not caring, or not showing the huge sigh of relief) Okay.<br />
Me: Here&#8217;s the deal. This is the 50th anniversary of the CBC, and they want to make a big thing of it. So they&#8217;re sending a train across Canada for about two months, making stops and doing presentations, and they need someone to do computer work, take pictures, document the trip, shoot video, and probably a billion other things. She wants me to go. I want to go. I need two months off.<br />
Him: (Without barely a pause) Okay.<br />
I love this company.<br />
Over the next few weeks, having to shoot video dropped from the radar, and the time shortened to just under a month and a half. But I had the green light, and it was full steam ahead.<br />
Until yesterday, I couldn&#8217;t really talk about it (see [[Working at CBC Headquarters in Toronto]]). Okay, I had talked about it to a few people, but that was before I found out I wasn&#8217;t supposed to. But yesterday was the official first notice to the world of the CBC&#8217;s intentions. So I&#8217;m free to talk.<br />
On 3 September, I&#8217;ll be in Vancouver, getting the train ready, finishing my training (no pun intended) and preparing for the Big Event. 7 September is our first public event, in Vancouver. From there, we visit Kamloops, Jasper, Edmonton, Biggar, Saskatoon, Melville, Winnipeg, Sioux Lookout, Capreol, Sudbury, Windsor, London, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Campbellton, Moncton, and finishing in Halifax on 5 October.<br />
To say I&#8217;m excited is &#8230; well, let&#8217;s just say that concentrating at work as been a little difficult as of late.<br />
So what&#8217;s my part in all this? I&#8217;ll be the New Media Representative. My job will be to keep the New Media side of things running. This includes 6-9 kiosks (depending on who you ask), taking pictures, handing out free stuff, setting up displays (and taking them down), and writing about it in journal entries. Starting in September, you&#8217;ll be able to keep track of (almost) my every move on CBC&#8217;s website.<br />
And I&#8217;m gonna be on a train for 33 glorious days. (If you can&#8217;t see the dopey grin on my face right now, your monitor must be broken.) The only bad part of this is that I have to wait three weeks for all this to start. I don&#8217;t know if I can hold out that long.<br />
I&#8217;m gonna be working on the railroad, all the live long month and a half!</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Somewhere, in a long-forgotten book in some dusty corner of a decrepit building in a burned out city, there is a sentence that says vacations are supposed to be restful. And someone is going to a lot of trouble to make sure I can&#8217;t find that sentence.<br />
Last week, starting very early on 3 August, I flew to Ontario. As luck would have it, I was on the same red-eye flight with my cousin Pam and her beau, Sean. Normally, this would be reason for celebration, but flying red-eye basically means you sleep the whole way. And believe me, sleeping is far easier with leather seats.<br />
Yes, leather. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s gotten into WestJet, but at least one of their planes has leather seats. Not just one. Not just a few. All of the seats. The only downer: The ones backing onto the emergency exit rows don&#8217;t recline. (I found out the hard way.)<br />
You&#8217;re probably wondering what I was doing on a red-eye flight given my dislike for them (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), but it came down to an issue of price. Red-eyes are cheap. And with leather seats, I might be doing more red-eyes in the future.<br />
This was the first time I flew into Pearson on WestJet, and I reminded myself yet again why I hate that airport. It&#8217;s too slow. Cathy was circling for over 20 minutes before hearing from me. I told her to park &#8212; I was going to be a while longer.<br />
Bags in hand, Cathy and I headed to Oakville. Pam and Sean disappeared to Stratford. We wouldn&#8217;t see them again until the following Friday. Arriving home, my mother welcomed me at the door, and I made a beeline for the bed.<br />
Leather seats or not, I didn&#8217;t get enough sleep.<br />
The Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were filled with various wedding-related tasks, not the least of which was picking things up, dropping things off, and getting things organized. (Yeah, real vague, I know, but I&#8217;d be writing an entire log entry just on that stuff alone.)<br />
Oh, whose wedding, you ask? I&#8217;ll give you a hint: Not mine.<br />
After a long wait, my sister&#8217;s beau, Craig, finally proposed to her on Christmas morning (see [[Christmas with my Family in Oakville, Cathy Gets Engaged]]), making not only Cathy very happy, but the rest of my family as well. And after almost eight long months of waiting, it was time for the happy day to arrive.<br />
I had originally come out to Ontario a week in advance to help out with all the little last-minute details that I expected would crop up. But unbeknownst to me, events would transpire that would change the course of my week.<br />
Details on that in a following log, of course.<br />
Suffice to say, come Tuesday, I was no longer in Oakville. Instead, I spent a lot of time at the CBC head office on Front Street (see [[Working at CBC Headquarters in Toronto]]), working for my friend Brenda. That sucked up pretty much every spare second I had for four days, although I did manage to leave at a somewhat &#8220;respectable&#8221; hour on Thursday to return home for dinner (the family invasion formally began that evening) and early on Friday (for obvious reasons).<br />
But even on Saturday morning, we didn&#8217;t get a chance to slow down. It was go-go-go from the moment my alarm went off at 8:00am. The first task for me was to get Craig and Dave (Craig&#8217;s best man) over to the barber so we could get our haircut. (Mine was looking something like a floor mop.)<br />
Craig and Dave were the first ones up, disposing of their excess locks. Completed, they disappeared off to Craig and Cathy&#8217;s house to await orders. My turn. So in addition to looking respectable again (yeah, tough as that might sound), I also had a shave. A real one. With a straight razor. Luckily, Sandy is one of the best barbers in Ontario; certainly the best I&#8217;ve ever had. I had complete faith in him not to slice something off.<br />
I should point out that I&#8217;ve never had a shave with anything but an electric razor. So my skin is quite sensitive. Sandy had to shave me twice to prevent slicing me open. But he did a good job &#8212; even by 11pm, I hadn&#8217;t grown much of a beard back, and I grow fast.<br />
Following the shave was some chores around the house &#8212; mostly moving things. (Aunt Ruth was madly preparing flowers, which needed placing; Aunt Karen brought a light trellis that needed assembling; and flowers all over the place needed watering.) And somewhere in all that, I ran to the grocery store to stock up on almost $80 in Clamato and orange juice.<br />
After a quick bolt through the shower, I rode over to pick up Craig and Dave. They were dressed in their finest, ready for the show. I piled them into the minivan, and hauled them back to the Sowrey homestead. People had started to arrive, though it was mostly family. But you could hear the Great Engine beginning to turn over&#8230;<br />
Inside, people were officially going crazy. Mom was getting dressed, Cathy was talking with everyone, the caterers were running around &#8230; I almost felt like I was in a Keystone Cops short. But it was time for myself to get dressed. Unlike Craig and Dave, though, I would not be wearing a tux. Cathy had made one request: Wear Dad&#8217;s kilt.<br />
When Dad had been diagnosed with brain cancer, he had been told he had a year to live. All he wanted to know was if he would live to see his daughter&#8217;s wedding. When he passed away in March, there was a hole that needed filling.<br />
Instead of Dad, it would be I who would walk Cathy down the aisle. And she was only walking down it if there was someone next to her wearing Dad&#8217;s kilt. Luckily for me, it fit, albeit a little tight and very warm in that mid-August heat.<br />
Oh, and in case you&#8217;re wondering, I did not wear it regimental style. (That means sans undergarments.) Why? Well, originally I was, but then I remembered all the troublemakers C&amp;C had invited to the party, and suddenly I wasn&#8217;t really filled with a great deal of confidence about their abilities to remain mature. (I was right, too. Cathy&#8217;s boss shoved one of the disposable cameras under my kilt while we were engaged in group photos.)<br />
The minister arrived and gave the &#8220;pep&#8221; talks with Craig and Cathy (independently &#8212; Cathy forbade Craig to see her prior to the ceremony). There was no practice ceremony &#8212; C&amp;C (as we in the family refer to them) like flying by the seat of their pants.<br />
After running around for about 20 minutes, Cathy finally pronounced she was ready. The minister pronounced he was ready. (I don&#8217;t think Craig had a choice.) It was time. The music was cued, and Cathy went out the front door.<br />
The guests waited in the backyard. Cathy, Julie, and I walked to the side. Julie took a deep breath, and then walked through the gate to the snapping of shutters. We&#8217;d been told to give Julie lots of room before coming in. Dramatic pause, dawdling, psychological torture, call it what you will. Right up until we started walking in, arm in arm, Cathy had been cool and collected. The second we rounded that corner, she couldn&#8217;t stop shaking.<br />
I felt a little guilty. This was Cathy&#8217;s big day, and I was sharing the limelight with her. At first, I was just walking my sister. But after a few moments, it suddenly became real. Like someone had wiped the fog from the bathroom mirror. To say the feeling was overwhelming is like suggesting a hurricane is a light breeze. It took everything I had not to cry.<br />
Once Cathy was next to Craig, the ceremony started to take shape, and things went quickly. True to their word, it lasted only 20 minutes before the legalities were over, and the new Mr. and Mrs. were presented to the assembly. Many pictures ensued.<br />
After they ceremoniously walked out as husband and wife (returning after a few photos on the front lawn), came the toast to the couple. Huntsville Dave would be the speaker, a neighbour of C&amp;C at their cottage. He, like the rest of the ceremony, spoke without a script, and without a clue about what he was going to say before it was said.<br />
(A note on Daves. C&amp;C seem to know a lot of them. Too many, as a matter of fact. So many, that they all have qualifiers, usually denoting where they live: Huntsville, Scarborough, Ainsville, Oakville, and so forth.)<br />
As the speech finished, I quickly ducked inside to take off the jacket to the kilt. Although I would later learn that it is customary to keep your jacket on until the groom removes his, I was wearing something designed for winter conditions. With all due deference to my new brother-in-law, I was dying in that thing.<br />
Shortly after, we gathered the families, and went for the photographs. Cameras were everywhere. We were lucky that it was bright enough that most didn&#8217;t use flashes. I can only imagine the bright spots I would have seen.<br />
While this was going on, the catering staff had opened the bar, and people not taking pictures (or being in them) had started to mingle. Hors d&#8217;oeurves were shortly followed, and quickly eaten. There was laughter, music, food, and drink. No-one, as far as I can tell, had a bad time.<br />
The finger foods soon gave way to more &#8220;formal&#8221; foods: seafood (raw oysters, lox, shrimp), sushi, and roast beef on a bun. Yeah, doesn&#8217;t sound too fancy, but then the food should fit the couple. (I&#8217;m not saying C&amp;C aren&#8217;t fancy, but they&#8217;re not pretentious.) And for the record, I&#8217;ve never had buffet-style roast beef that good before.<br />
After a while, the speeches started. Cathy had hit upon the idea of using an old family gong to get people&#8217;s attention when words were to be said, and people to expect a kiss from the bride and groom. The first few were tame (even with a rather emotional speech from Cathy&#8217;s boss), but they got more interesting as the evening wore on.<br />
The one that really surprised us was Julie&#8217;s husband, Dave. He&#8217;s a great guy, just not usually talkative. We were floored when he got up in front of 90-odd people to extol the virtues of his friends. (We were even more floored with his impassioned interpretation of the Village People&#8217;s &#8220;YMCA&#8221; later on.)<br />
And somewhere in there, was my speech. But this wasn&#8217;t to C&amp;C, it was on behalf of the family to everyone else. It was thanks for the effort and trouble people had to go through to come, some from as far as Anguilla and Vancouver. (Even Gerry and Sam dropped in for a while, who live in Bermuda. Although they were in the area for other reasons.) When it came time to end my speech, I needed a something interesting, funny, and appropriate. So naturally, I drew a blank.<br />
I think that&#8217;s when Dad stepped in. Before I knew it, this is what I&#8217;d said:<br />
&#8220;And if you should find that something is missing here tonight, please do not hesitate to let us know. We&#8217;ll make sure that you get so drunk that you won&#8217;t remember.&#8221;<br />
Dad had definitely made it to the wedding.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t long before it was time for the first dance. Craig used to teach dance at Arthur Murray, so we all expected quite a show. Unfortunately, he hadn&#8217;t had a chance to teach Cathy yet. But it was still something out of a fairy tale to watch.<br />
Following the dance, it was time to dance with the parents. I was to fill in for Dad. However, we had a slight change in plans, when Don stepped instead. Don is virtually a surrogate father for Cathy and I &#8212; we&#8217;ve known him that long. I think Cathy was a little concerned that I felt pushed out in favour of Don, but I think there was no better person for the job.<br />
Besides, I can&#8217;t dance.<br />
Admittedly, the rest of the evening gets a little hazy from there. About 11:00 or so, I made the mistake of switching from beer to wine, although I don&#8217;t know why. So come about 2:00am, I was apparently incapable of independent vertical alignment, nor could annunciate baby gibberish, let alone a coherent sentence. And I would pay dearly for it the next morning.<br />
Which began at about 10:00am. We had to get ready for the lunch with family, as many of them would be taking off for home again. This also gave C&amp;C time to unwrap the presents they received the night before.<br />
The barbecue billowed smoke from all the hamburgers, the pot boiled corn, and we ate to our hearts&#8217; content. It was a good day, following a great night. And the hilarity around the presents made it even better.<br />
The single best one, in my opinion, was from the Navis family, an old family friend. They gave C&amp;C a poem, on which was a series of instructions on how to build a fence. Each step corresponded to a numbered envelope, which contained a series of gift certificates representative of that step (e.g. coffee, wood, beer, and dinner). And to top it off, his and her hammers and pint beer mugs.<br />
That night, we sat in the back yard, and listened to the crickets, the wind through the trees, and the complete lack of any semblance of traffic or other noises. As Don, another old family friend remarked, it was the end of an era. His era was the end of comfortable backyards. Mine was different. It was the end of the neighbourhood as I knew it. It would be the last night for me next to the pool. The last meal was Chinese. The last swim had been with my cousin, Jen. It would be the last night I slept in the house that I was raised in.<br />
But no amount of sombreness would diminish the happiness of the previous days&#8217; events. The wedding had been more than Cathy could have dreamed for. She and Craig were now readying for a week at their cottage to spend some much needed time relaxing. We would all be happy with the way things went, and with the way things would go.<br />
Even with the killer hangover that I think I&#8217;ve still got.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is my second day here at the CBC head office in Toronto. This is a weird place.<br />
You&#8217;re probably asking: What is Geoff doing at the CBC head office in Toronto? That&#8217;s a question I can&#8217;t answer just yet &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to wait until next Tuesday. (The irony is that this won&#8217;t be posted until after I can say what I&#8217;m doing at the CBC. So I could tell you why I&#8217;m here. But hey, it&#8217;s all about telling a story.)<br />
I came in yesterday, taking the GO Train from Clarkson, in the very west of Mississauga. The trip out was quite pleasant (the joys of express trains), and relaxing &#8230; so I thought. The train arrived smoothly and without urgency. I was expecting a leisurely walk to the CBC building (I was a half hour early). Wrong expectation.<br />
As soon as the doors opened, I was overwhelmed with a panic, similar to that of stampeding animals. I felt the urge to move very quickly, and stay with the herd, er, crowd.<br />
Now I remember why I like living in Calgary &#8212; less pressure.<br />
Wandering down Front Street, I quite quickly found myself at the main doors. Not only was I very early, but I was remarking at how HUGE this place is. The building is the size of a city block, no question. It&#8217;s 10 stories tall, not counting the basements. It&#8217;s so big it has at least four sets of elevators &#8212; probably six or more. They&#8217;re colour-coded so you can find them easily.<br />
That&#8217;s assuming, of course, that you can find anything in this building. King Minos&#8217; labyrinth wasn&#8217;t this confusing. (Nor was the 6th floor of the Math and Computer building at the University of Waterloo, despite its near-legendary lack of structure.)<br />
It&#8217;s a bit of a surreal experience. It&#8217;s a true media outlet. (The only thing the CBC doesn&#8217;t touch is print &#8212; but give them the chance, and I&#8217;d bet they would.) You&#8217;d almost expect to run into one of a large number of semi-famous people (I reserve &#8220;famous&#8221; for those instantly recognizable) roaming the halls.<br />
I have yet to see Peter Mansbridge, though.<br />
It took me most of yesterday to get the gist of how this place works. Luckily for me, Brenda returned this morning to really get things moving. While I have a vague idea of what I need to do, Brenda had a lot of the details I didn&#8217;t.<br />
The building offers some interesting services, aside from the media aspects, of course. There&#8217;s the Glenn Gould Studio, a concert hall cum recording studio; robotic mail delivery; an in-house credit union (almost every employee here is unionized); a very in-depth intranet; a beautiful atrium (big bucks in construction, no doubt) that includes a sushi bar; a museum (or three); and probably a lot of stuff I just haven&#8217;t found yet.<br />
And I&#8217;ve only been here two days. I&#8217;ll be here for a couple of days more, though. Then it&#8217;s my sister&#8217;s wedding, and back home.<br />
Three weeks later, I&#8217;m off on another adventure of a lifetime.<br />
Which I can&#8217;t tell you about.<br />
Yet.</p>

	<header class="entry-header">
		
		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="http://geoff.wp/2002/07/chasing-cn-6060-stettler-big-valley/" rel="bookmark">Chasing CN 6060 Stettler to Big Valley</a></h2>	</header><!-- .entry-header -->

	
	
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s been about nine months since I last saw 6060, when I left Jasper for Calgary. That&#8217;s about eight months too long, I figure.<br />
Mind you, many haven&#8217;t seen 6060 since early November, since we&#8217;ve all been off living our lives while she sat in a shed for the winter. And as we had little money for maintenance work, little was done over the winter. In fact, almost nothing&#8217;s been done this spring or summer, either. It&#8217;s very handy when you pass all of your inspections.<br />
That doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be problems. Arriving just after 9:00, I found a large portion of the team staring at the air compressor. Apparently, on it&#8217;s first run of the year (the day before), the compressor had lost its lubricant. Something wasn&#8217;t working.<br />
What exactly was broken, I&#8217;m not sure. But it took seven people to get it back together again. (There&#8217;s a joke about trainmen and a lightbulb in there somewhere.) The air compressor is a vastly complicated piece of machinery &#8212; something I fear I&#8217;ll one day have to pull apart to repair. But I got my first taste, so hopefully next time it won&#8217;t be so bad.<br />
Just so long as my memory of what we did doesn&#8217;t get displaced by some other seemingly random piece of useless trivia.<br />
But just after noon, we declared 6060 fully operational (without the air compressor, we would have gone nowhere), and were ready to do the run to Big Valley. 6060 will do only seven runs this year. It&#8217;s a small number, but it&#8217;s far better than just sitting around. Luckily, this was one run I got to follow.<br />
The Stettler to Big Valley run is quite short &#8212; only about 30 kilometres. Mind you, it takes over an hour to run it, because 6060 can&#8217;t run quickly on the line with passengers. That makes it very easy to pass for taking pictures. Which is precisely what Graham and I did that Saturday afternoon.<br />
Interestingly enough, I first met Graham chasing 2816 (see [[The Inaugural Run of the Steam Locomotive CPR Empress, CP 2816]]). It didn&#8217;t take long for us to become friends, having a mutual love for trains (although I lean more to steam; Graham&#8217;s partial to anything on rails). It also didn&#8217;t take long to convince Graham to join the Rocky Mountain Rail Society.<br />
This was Graham&#8217;s first meeting with the RMRS, although he nearly missed 6060&#8217;s 14:30 departure from Stettler. We hooked up about a half-kilometre down the line from the station. And we started taking pictures.<br />
Graham had never been to Stettler before, and had never been down any of the side roads in the Stettler / Big Valley area. They&#8217;re a little hairy. Especially when you&#8217;re trying to outrun a train. (Even if it slow-moving.)<br />
Our first pictures were at a station-like landing just down from the station itself. Then we raced to the crossing just as you exited Stettler heading south on Hwy. 56. After that, we headed down to the road crossing at Warden. Followed by Warden South. And then at multiple crossings and hills overlooking the rails all the way down.<br />
The road we were on didn&#8217;t follow the tracks perfect, so we&#8217;d regularly lose sight of the rails. This was a problem because sometimes, the tracks would suddenly reappear, and you had to quickly judge whether it was worth stopping, or continuing down. And the suddenness was the problem &#8212; if you slammed on your brakes on the loose gravel road, you&#8217;d fishtail quite easily.<br />
I did a few times. (Although I had a rally car-like turn at one corner, trying to avoid a dog I saw, and turning onto a road about 10 seconds ahead of 6060. After I realized I wasn&#8217;t going to die, I was quite pleased with myself.)<br />
Taking pictures where we could, we weaved our way down to Big Valley, arriving in time to catch the train being held up by bandits (part of the show), and meeting the train in Big Valley itself. It was a little harried, but I introduced Graham to Don, Harry, Terry, and anyone else from the RMRS I could find.<br />
But then it was off for us, back to Calgary. (Separate ways, that is.) As much as I wanted to follow 6060 back to Stettler, I knew I wouldn&#8217;t last long enough. I was pretty tired and wanted to go home and rest. I&#8217;ll do the full run next time.<br />
Though not quite as fast, I think.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>96 hamburgers<br />
48 hotdogs<br />
4 jumbo-size bags of chips<br />
104 cans of pop<br />
240 bottles of beer<br />
13 bottles of wine<br />
14 hours of music<br />
1 house<br />
equals<br />
A good time<br />
All new homeowners have one responsibility to fulfill. It&#8217;s not taxes. It&#8217;s not a mortgage. It&#8217;s not even making sure the garbage goes out every day.<br />
It&#8217;s a housewarming party. (And taking double-duty as my 30th birthday party.)<br />
My family has a fairly simple tradition when it comes to parties: Do it right, or don&#8217;t do it at all. Chris and I had a corollary to that: Go big, or go home. Add &#8217;em together, and you have a recipe for a good time.<br />
Preparation began a couple days earlier, when Tamara and I made a run to the Costco in the northeast to stock up on foodstuffs and all the related materials for a barbecue. This included most of the ingredients listed above. This was followed up by two trips to the Kensington Wine Market for the &#8220;happy&#8221; drinks.<br />
Needless to say, the kitchen was a little awkward to walk around for a while.<br />
Luckily, we didn&#8217;t need to do a mass cleaning prior to Saturday &#8212; that had been done for when the family showed up last Thursday (see [[Family Comes out for my Birthday]]). But a little work was needed &#8212; a quick washing of the kitchen and bathroom, and the requisite yardwork.<br />
The yard isn&#8217;t looking great, and I&#8217;ll be the first to say it. We&#8217;ve had voluntary (read: mandatory) water restrictions in Calgary all month due to high sediment in the water treatment system. That&#8217;s fine with me &#8212; now I just won&#8217;t cut my grass. But it&#8217;s looking a little yellow. It&#8217;s not dry, though, so you can walk across it without trouble. But I had to clean up the yard a bit, and make it look at least presentable.<br />
After this was a run to refill the propane tank on the barbecue (the Beer Can chicken had used a fair bit of fuel) and get a lot of ice &#8212; 12 bags, to be specific. Luckily, I still had Mike and Brenda&#8217;s cooler, which make transporting (and preserving) ice very simple.<br />
By 1:45, two large yellow tubs were filled with pop and beer, the food ready (and carmelized onions nice and warm), and all we had to do was wait. And wait we did.<br />
First rule of all parties: They never start when they&#8217;re supposed to, and they never end when you want them to. So long as you can accept and understand this, you&#8217;ll always be relaxed. It&#8217;s taken me a few times to get this through my head, but now it&#8217;s an accepted fact.<br />
Slowly, people started arriving around 2:30. The first to arrive were Jin and Fritz. Fritz almost immediately started calling around to a dentist &#8212; the crown on one of his teeth had come off, and the pain was a little on the excrutiating side. (I should point out that Fritz is a total trooper. While most people might have dropped in briefly and left, Fritz went to the store, got some Fixodent, and then stuck around until nearly the end of the night.)<br />
The skies started to turn ugly. You can plan for virtually anything. During the summer in Calgary, you can also plan for the weather &#8212; it&#8217;s usually consistently sunny and warm. But if there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s very true here, it&#8217;s &#8220;if you don&#8217;t like the weather, wait five minutes&#8221;. We had a few drops of rain, which had a few people really worried that nothing would happen. But I held the faith &#8230; and I was rewarded. Sun crept out, and suddenly it was sunny again.<br />
By 4:00, the party was in full swing, people appearing out of the woodwork, everyone having (from what I can tell) a lot of fun. Around 4:30, I fired up the barbecue and started cooking for the hungry masses. Although I had a few people offer to take the cooking reigns so I could mingle, I was more than happy to cook &#8212; then everyone had to come to me. (There&#8217;s always meaning within my madness, even if it doesn&#8217;t look like it.)<br />
Even Robyn, my realtor came. She brought her husband, a friend of theirs, and their dog Chewie. (Yes, as in &#8220;Chewbacca&#8221;.) Chewie is a tiny little dog &#8230; about the size of a large rat, but significantly cuter, I have to say. Everyone loved Chewie, especially with how he chased Miao-Yin&#8217;s catnip monkey (which Miao-Yin doesn&#8217;t even bat an eye at anymore) and the pinecones. Chewie loves pinecones.<br />
People came and went as they pleased, which is exactly what I wanted: People to enjoy themselves. As the sun set behind the house (it was still very bright, I should add), I opened the presents that people had brought (many opted not to follow the &#8220;Bring Nothing&#8221; rule I had tried to impose). My friends are very generous and know me well. Therese and Stuart gave me a very nice reproduction of a Canadian Pacific poster, complete with a train. Jon and Pearl gave me a book on trains. (Like I said, my friends know me well.) A group of my friends (collectively known as the Asian Brother Crew) gave me The Godfather movie trilogy, which I was very happy about &#8212; I haven&#8217;t seen any of &#8217;em. (And admittedly, I&#8217;m curious to see if Godfather III is as bad as fans seem to make it out to be.)<br />
Before too long, the party whittled down to the hard core group, and pretty much all of us retreated indoors. Dispersed all around the main floor (suddenly I was very glad about not having a dining room table yet &#8212; that&#8217;s where Tamara&#8217;s couch is) were groups of people in discussion. Even Don from the Rocky Mountain Rail Society showed up for a while. I had been concerned that he would have no-one to talk to but myself, but it turned out that Virgil had bought his motorcycle from the same shop Don frequents. They hit it off almost instantly.<br />
I found a few people mingling around out front &#8212; mostly smokers. They were engaged in silly repartee, which of course meant I had join in for a while. This was fortunate because I managed to witness The Great Escape.<br />
Miao-Yin is a lovely cat. But she&#8217;s a bit of trouble. She eats Spaz&#8217;s food when I&#8217;m not looking (Cathy started calling Miao-Yin &#8220;Miss Piggy&#8221;), and she&#8217;s always trying to run outside. Miao-Yin used to be a stray before Chris picked her up from the Humane Society, and there&#8217;s a part of her that wants to run free. So when she found the open front window sans screen, she made a run for it. And the second she saw me, she turned, and bolted through a hedge.<br />
My heart sank faster than a meteor. The only thing that ran through my head was &#8220;Chris is gonna kill me&#8221;. I immediately hopped the fence and raced into the adjoining yard to hunt her down. Around the side of the house, into a darkened backyard, and she vanished. Panick began to set in. Although Miao-Yin&#8217;s microchipped, I was terrified that she might get hit by a car, attacked by another animal, or get taken in by someone else who didn&#8217;t want to give her up. Suddenly, I realized I was in bare feet running around in the dark. (The alcohol was rapidly thinning out in the adrenaline.) I quickly went home for my sandals and a flashlight.<br />
We initiated a neighbourhood-wide kitty hunt. Unfortunately, Miao-Yin doesn&#8217;t come to her name, so having 6-7 guys wandering around calling her name is somewhat ineffective. Figuring that she hadn&#8217;t gone too far (I hadn&#8217;t seen any cats wandering around), I grabbed the flashlight and shone it into the neighbour&#8217;s yard. Sure enough, there she was, hiding in shrubs on the far side. (I&#8217;m very thankful that she had white fur.)<br />
Racing around, she had time to move. Thinking I was gonna be chasing her all over the neighbourhood again, I got lucky and found her down the side of a house. I called for Miao-Yin&#8217;s food and laid some on the ground. She slowly came out sniff, allowed me to pet her, which was when I pinned her to the ground like a Mexican wrestler. Almost immediately, she knew she was going home again. She struggled, but I had a very firm grip, and she wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.<br />
Suffice to say, the little hairball ain&#8217;t going outside again.<br />
Spaz just sat in her window and snickered, in whatever way a cat can snicker.<br />
The party dwindled, people taking their leave and heading home. Soon, it was just Carl, Adrian, and I, sitting on the deck, talking about what came to mind. But even time caught up with Adrian, and he, too, went home. Carl and I sat up a while longer, chatting, although we had to retreat inside because it (finally) got cool enough that it&#8217;s uncomfortable to be outside without a sweater.<br />
The party finally ended at 1:15am Sunday morning. The house hadn&#8217;t been trashed, not a single thing broken. Had it not been for the furry Houdini act, the evening would have been quite tame and comfortable. (Mind you, she got revenge by trashing the kitchen during the night. Took me about three hours to clean up the mess.)<br />
Unfortunately, despite the seeming success of the event, it couldn&#8217;t really be called a party.<br />
The cops never showed up.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s always good when people drop by.<br />
It&#8217;s even better when it&#8217;s family. And they bring gifts.<br />
Most of the Tisdale clan descended on Calgary this weekend. Partly because we hadn&#8217;t seen everyone in a while, partly because a few people (namely Mom, Cathy, and Craig) wanted to see my house, and the rest because my 30th birthday was looming in the coming days.<br />
I arrived at the airport on Thursday (11 July 2002) around 8:30, a couple minutes after the flight from Toronto was to have touched down. But somehow, I managed to miss them at the gate. I managed to find them down by the baggage claim, though &#8212; Craig flagging me down.<br />
Bags claimed, we headed back to my car, and off to my house. Cathy and Craig were staying with me, but Mom was going to stay at the Westin. She really wanted to stay in her own room, and get some time to herself. But first, she wanted to check on Spaz.<br />
Spaz is my &#8220;new&#8221; cat. Spaz was originally my Grandma&#8217;s (Dad&#8217;s mom) cat, which she named Yum Yum. However, Grandma has never called any cat by the name which was given, always calling them &#8220;Puss&#8221;. That&#8217;s what my family calls the cat. I&#8217;ve always called the cat &#8220;Spaz&#8221;, for the way she acted since she was a kitten. When my Grandma moved into a care facility, Dad took Spaz into our home. With Dad&#8217;s passing in March, Spaz was to become homeless &#8212; Mom&#8217;s not really a pet person.<br />
Ironically enough, though, it was Mom who really wanted to see Spaz and make sure she was okay. This almost drove me to the point of lunacy. Miao-Yin and Spaz haven&#8217;t exactly been getting along. They still stare and growl at each other. Well, actually, it&#8217;s mostly Spaz. Miao-Yin&#8217;s been pretty easy with the whole situation, but Spaz &#8230; well, I love her to death, but she just doesn&#8217;t make sense sometimes.<br />
Mom hung around for a couple of drinks, before I took her over to her hotel. Cathy, Craig, and I waited up a while longer, but soon we all went to bed. They were tired &#8230; I had to go work in the morning. I had thought it would be a bit of a challenge in the morning getting out without waking them, too, but it seems Craig&#8217;s an early riser and really needed coffee.<br />
The day was typical for me: Meetings, fires to put out, fires to start, and the general half-calm/half-chaos that seems to regularly engulf my life. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve gotten used to.<br />
I bolted as close to 5:00pm as possible, making an immediate run for my bike, and a fairly brisk ride home. The first surprise of many that I would receive on the weekend was waiting for me as I came through the back gate: A patio set.<br />
I love my family.<br />
This was a gift from my Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, and Nana (Mom&#8217;s mom). It looked strangely normal sitting on my deck, though not quite as comfortable as Mom, Cathy, and Craig looked sitting at it. I joined them for a while, until Tamara came home. (Tamara, as you might recall, is my roommate &#8212; see [[Moving into my New (Old) House]].) Tamara then got the chance to finally meet my family, having on a short introduction that morning.<br />
We were off to a family dinner up at my Aunt and Uncle&#8217;s. It was a typical family dinner, with lots of talk, lots of laughter, and lots of good food. In attendance were Mom, Cathy, Craig, Nana, Aunt Brenda, Uncle Mike, Jen (Brenda and Mike&#8217;s daughter), Pam and Darren (cousins from another branch of the tree), and Muck, Pam&#8217;s boyfriend. (&#8220;Muck&#8221; is a nickname, his real name is Sean. For some reason, everyone calls him &#8220;Muck&#8221;.)<br />
We got what I consider to be a first glimpse of what Craig and Cathy&#8217;s wedding will be like. Muck, Darren, Mike, and Craig were constantly laughing at something (particularly in their group concensus of how much beer to put on the steaks), which gave the rest of us a little pause. If they were like that at just a dinner, we could only imagine what the wedding will be like.<br />
The next day I was not allowed to sleep in. Apparently, it was shopping day, and I had no idea what we were shopping for, or even where we were going. I wasn&#8217;t allowed to know. But before we could start, we had one little detail to take care of: Breakfast. Taking a page from Ed and Jen&#8217;s visit (see [[Star Wars and the Last Episode of The X-Files]]), we went to The Galaxie. While the food was as good as it had always been, I probably should have taken them to the Arden Diner &#8212; both are huge fans of Jann Arden.<br />
After breakfast, we picked up Mom, and prepared to go shopping. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure where we were going &#8212; only that it was towards the northeast &#8212; but it was only a few minutes (and a phone call) that gave me the hin that were in search of a dishwasher.<br />
I had a dishwasher. It came with the house. But dishes came out dirtier than they went in. I knew that the dishwasher wasn&#8217;t that great &#8212; the home inspector had told me it would need to be replaced (see [[Meeting with the Home Inspector]]). I just hadn&#8217;t expected this.<br />
We ended up at Field Appliances in the northeast, where awaited my new dishwasher. It was a lot fancier than the ones I had looked at before, but I did rather like it. And it all mine, ready to install. All we needed to do was get it come, and take about an hour or so to hook it all up.<br />
This is where Mike and Brenda came into the picture again. First, they showed up in their truck to haul the dishwasher back to my house. Then Mike graciously donated not only his tools but also himself &#8212; so he, Craig, and I could take a crack at getting the new dishwasher installed.<br />
It was fairly easy to remove the old one, though it was very rusted and virtually falling apart. Getting the new one in was a bit more of a challenge, but it wasn&#8217;t long before it, too, slid into place and started whirring. I must say that it&#8217;s very nice, and it does a much better job.<br />
Did I mention that my family is amazing?<br />
About that time, Mom and Cathy returned from their shopping side-trip (we&#8217;d split ways at Field Appliances), which had been to Revy. They returned with some supplies for installing a doorbell (another gift), an extension cord (even though I already had one), and a screen door replacement kit. (My sliding door has a screen door, but no screen.) While they ordered pizza for lunch, I replaced the screen.<br />
For family dinner #2, I invited all those still in town (Pam, Darren, and Muck disappeared off to Waterton earlier that day) to come over and experience Beer Can Chicken. It&#8217;s a ridiculously simple recipe that I had been dying to try. Luckily for me, no-one seemed to mind that they were guinea pigs.<br />
I managed to sleep in a little bit the following morning, which I really needed. But there&#8217;s no rest for the wicked &#8212; we had things to do that day, too. First off, was relax with the family. This was easy. The hard part was trying to install the doorbell.<br />
If you look in my basement, it looks a little small, compared with the rest of the house. This is because it&#8217;s not full-sized &#8212; it&#8217;s actually about 2/3 the dimensions of the house. The rest is infill of some kind, for reasons I neither understand, nor will likely be able to find. But this is what we had to get into to find where we were going to install the power line to the doorbell. Or specifically, Craig.<br />
Craig is the original handiman. He&#8217;s a commercial electrician, and appears to have installed everything known to the modern household. And he&#8217;s not shy about rolling around in the dirt. But it took him, Uncle Mike, myself, a two-foot long drill bit, and a 3/8 spade bit to figure out where the wall was under the floor, carve two holes big enough so we could run wire, and then pull the wire up from the basement.<br />
It was a little more drawn out that that &#8212; about two hours drawn out &#8212; but I don&#8217;t think anyone really wants to read those details.<br />
But before long, about an hour before Mom, Cathy, and Craig had to be at the airport, the largish white box next to my front door burst out with the 1812 Overture.<br />
Craig ran through the shower, changed, grabbed a beer, and we were off quickly to see Nana before the flight. We stayed only a few minutes before I had to take them the rest of the way to the airport for the flight out.<br />
About an hour after leaving, I was back home, and starting to clean. We&#8217;d managed to create quite a mess. But it&#8217;s all part of the fun of having family around.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>One of these days, I&#8217;m gonna learn to stop cheating death (or at least severe injury) and cease doing really foolish things.<br />
Like whitewater rafting.<br />
As you no doubt have already guessed, we were downriver again this year, third in a row for me (see [[Janine and Dory&#8217;s Wedding, White Water Rafting on the Kicking Horse River]] and [[A Whitewater Rafting Adventure on the Kicking Horse River]]), on Saturday (6 July). I had hoped that our troupe would be larger than previous years, but in the end we still ended up with a good crew. Despite Carl having to back out at literally the last minute, we still had 14 people brave enough to dare the trip.<br />
Shortly after 8:00, I headed up to Beddington to pick up Torin and his girlfriend, Nicole. They would be my companions for the trip out to the Whitewater Ranch. Picking them up around 8:30, we made a hasty trip for the Esso station on Stoney Trail, where we would obtain fuel for the car, and fuel (in the form of TimBits) for ourselves.<br />
I had hoped and prayed that this year, I wouldn&#8217;t have to break speed limits to get to our destination on time. But for some reason, half of Calgary had turned out at the station, and it took Torin nearly 25 minutes to get our TimBits. I ended up driving a little quicker than I would have liked.<br />
I just hope the speed planes weren&#8217;t flying that day. (So far, so good.)<br />
We pulled in just after 11:30, to find Tom and Corey already there (they had camped the night before), two men who would later turn out to be Doug B.&#8217;s brother and friend, and I found Angie&#8217;s car, but Angie, Tyler, and Karen were not to be seen. We would later find them down by the river. Doug and his friend would show up not too long after (they had picked up a pair of rather attractive French hitchhikers, and taken them to Golden &#8212; an extra hour round trip), finally followed by Liza and her friend Peter (the explained their tardiness as: &#8220;We have an excuse: We&#8217;re Swedish.&#8221;).<br />
As we mingled around waiting for things to get underway, we stood around and chatted, talking about the things we could expect, when I heard my name being called. At first I thought it was someone from my group, but I was quite surprised to see Janet, a former Critical Mass employee who had worked in our Bistro. We talked briefly &#8212; she was up with her friends as part of her birthday present.<br />
Lunch started shortly after noon, and we ate excitedly, just ready for a great trip down river. It was a gorgeous day, nice and sunny, warm, and the water level was ideal for us to get some really good rapids. After lunch, Rhino (a long-time guide) did his standard safety schtick. It hasn&#8217;t changed much in the last three years, although he introduced some new material this time. The speech still drew laughs, so it wasn&#8217;t all bad.<br />
Then it was over to pick up equipment. Unlike previous years, we were told that unless we got cold on a hot day, the fleeces weren&#8217;t really necessary. (Which, as we found out, was true.) Also, unlike last year, there were no gloves. After a while up front, I really needed them &#8212; my hands were like icecubes after a while.<br />
We suited up, put our change of clothes away, and marched down to the river for the next safety briefing. This was the typical &#8220;what to do if you fall out of the boat&#8221; speech. Hardly anything different than the previous years, so I kinda tuned out for part of it. (You can only listen to the Flight Attendant Safety Speech so many times before you can do it yourself.)<br />
Finally, it was time to call rafts. I had tried to book Mike, the guide we&#8217;d had the year before. He&#8217;s certifiably insane, and an absolute blast to have as a guide. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s a little hard to get a specific guide unless you follow them like a lost puppy. Besides, if there&#8217;s one thing Kootenay River Runners can boast, it&#8217;s some of the most maverick river guides in the area.<br />
We didn&#8217;t get Mike, nor did our other half of the team. (One of the two groups of a rather large stag party had the pleasure of learning about the &#8220;Shocker&#8221;.) Instead, my group pulled down a new guy by the name of Earl. (Actually, that was his last name. However, there were so many guys with his first name that it made a little more sense.)<br />
Earl was about as stereotypical a &#8220;mountain man&#8221; as it comes. Toned, well-tanned, and a beard that was half-way between well-kempt and complete disarray. That&#8217;s to say nothing of his hair. But amongst all of it, his smile beamed like a lighthouse.<br />
So I tested him.<br />
&#8220;Are you certifiably insane?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What?&#8221;<br />
Well, at least he didn&#8217;t cackle like a madman.<br />
My raft bore Torin, Nicole, Tom, Corey, Liza, Peter, myself, and an eight person, Nora. I&#8217;d talked with Nora (not knowing who she was) prior to lunch, so having her join along wasn&#8217;t a big deal. As it turned out, Nora was also a friend of Earl&#8217;s, out visiting from Vancouver.<br />
We boarded our raft and began our trip downriver. Torin and I sat at front, wearing only our wetsuits and the life jackets. It was hot, even in just that. (Although after a small rapid, and just prior to the main set, Earl suggested we put our splash jackets on.)<br />
We began the usual drills: Paddling, moving around in the raft, and holding on for dear life. This was old hat for me (having done it two times before), but you always have to learn to work in a team, and this was a group I was unfamiliar with. It wasn&#8217;t long before we were ready.<br />
Which was good, because the river level was higher than the year before, and we needed all the skill we had to brave the rapids and emerge on the other side unscathed, and unflipped.<br />
Earl is what I would refer to as a technical guide. He knows how the boat will roll (and describes exactly what will happen), knows the rapids and how to get through them (with assistance from his crew), and is very careful to instruct the team on exactly what to do to survive not only in the raft, but out of the raft in the event of falling over the edge.<br />
Before long, we were barrelling down the rapids, charging through, around, and across rocks and waves, getting ourselves thoroughly soaked from head to foot. At one point, Torin and I caught a rather large wave &#8230; it was almost like someone emptying a bathtub of barely above freezing water on our heads. Nicole wished she had a picture of us &#8212; the look on our faces was apparently priceless.<br />
The upper portion of the Kicking Horse was better than the previous year, and not as wild as the first. And I finally think I got a grasp of the rapid names. There are two particularly wild sections: Portage and Shotgun. Portage named due to what people used to do around it. Shotgun &#8230; well, that&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess. As for the mythical Tablesaw, Earl made no mention of it, making me wonder if it&#8217;s really there at all.<br />
We breezed through Portage and Shotgun without difficulty, only once colliding with another raft when I lost my ability to paddle after losing my grip on the edge. (In the future, I&#8217;m going to stay off the bow &#8212; I keep sliding off.)<br />
Finally, we reached the end of the Upper Kicking Horse. Unlike previous years, though, this was not the end of our journey. Even though out of the group, only Angie and I had done the river at all, we were psyched and ready to take the challenge.<br />
Boarding the bus, we headed a few kilometres down river (necessary, as the section of the river between the Upper and the Lower is commercially impassible). We had to hike a bit down a rather steep railway access road where we picked up our rafts (they were driven down for us), and entered for our second burst at the river.<br />
I took a backseat, and Nora took my place. We were ready.<br />
Admittedly, Earl made the lower section out to be a little wilder, a little rougher, and a lot harder than it really was.<br />
That&#8217;s not to say that it was easy. We had to follow instructions carefully. We had to make sure that we did exactly as we were told. The Lower river isn&#8217;t an easy stretch. It&#8217;s fun, but if you make a wrong move, you can end up swimming a bit downriver.<br />
Which is almost what happened to us.<br />
As we were rolling through one stretch of rapid, Earl came to realize halfway through that were probably going to be in a bit of trouble. We very quickly went from an all-forward paddle to an all-back paddle, which managed to keep us from going over a large rapid that would have flipped us.<br />
However, we rolled into a smaller rapid, which we went over sideways. Normally, we would slide right through and continue on our way down. However, the rolling action of the water kept us pinned in the rapid, and we were unable to get out.<br />
At first, I wasn&#8217;t at all worried. We&#8217;d done this very thing the year before with Mike (except we did it nose-first), and had a whale of a time. However, after a few moments, it was clear that we weren&#8217;t having fun. We were actually in a bit of trouble.<br />
The raft rocked side-to-side, sometimes filling with a little water. Earl was straining behind me, trying to pry us loose. He called out a couple of commands, none of which had any effect. Finally, he started to swamp the boat. The extra weight would keep us from flipping, and would hopefully help us out of the rapid. He let us know we were alright, which kept us from panicking.<br />
After what seemed more than five minutes (but was probably like one), we broke free, and continued our journey.<br />
Seemingly almost as soon as we had started, we found ourselves in the eastern end of Golden, and at the end of our river trip. We pulled the rafts from the river, boarded the bus, and spent the next half-hour on our trip back to Whitewater Ranch. I sat with Nora, and talked about the trip, and tried to get a better idea of who our rafting buddy had been.<br />
Back at the ranch, we changed, and prepared for the long trip home.<br />
With a side-trip to St. James Gate in Banff (Bamf!), of course.<br />
The trip is over. But there&#8217;s always next year.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are parties.<br />
Then there&#8217;s a Critical Mass party.<br />
Five years ago yesterday (4 July 1997), Critical Mass launched its first ever website, <a href="http://www.mbusa.com/">MBUSA.com</a>. That first launch wasn&#8217;t perfect, but it started a business relationship that has lasted ever since. MB is still our largest client, and the project I&#8217;ve been on for most of my time here.<br />
What&#8217;s that have to do with a party? Well, quite some time ago (a few months, to be exact), it was decided that we needed to celebrate the launch of our first website. And, this is the cool part, it was going to be a complete and utter surprise to everyone in the company.<br />
Except those who knew about it, anyway.<br />
I was one of those lucky few. I was asked to join the &#8220;Secret Committee&#8221; (or something equally quasi-mysterious). This group would help make the decisions that would affect everyone on that fateful day. This included things like activities, awards presentations, gifts, and so forth. It would also later expand to duties such as bus captain, and in my case, emcee.<br />
Having only returned from Ontario the day before, I would basically walk into an unsuspecting office for a whirlwind day of what I could only assume would be just short of a drunken mess. But I started off a little more sensibly: Charged camera batteries, a hat, sunscreen, and clothes that I knew I could wear all day without getting uncomfortable. I suggested to Tamara (my roommate &#8212; see [[Moving into my New (Old) House]] &#8212; who also works at Critical Mass) that she dress accordingly. I didn&#8217;t tell her why.<br />
I arrived at the office and proceeded to catch up on email that had been backing up for a couple of days. And when no-one was looking, I reviewed the script I was to read from. Before long, it was breakfast time. As per usual, I eat breakfast at the office (I pay $20 a month for the privilege). Normally, I&#8217;m there for about 15 minutes, and then I&#8217;m back at my desk. But this morning, we had to wait for an impromptu Town Hall meeting in the Bistro at 8:30.<br />
Di (our president) started a little after 8:30, and made a few quick announcements. The first was that we would not be coming in until noon the following day. This was expected &#8212; it was Stampede Parade Day. No company is open until noon on parade day. But there was another announcement.<br />
&#8220;Clear your calendars. You&#8217;re all going out at 10:30, and you&#8217;re not coming back until after 5pm.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;And it&#8217;s mandatory.&#8221;<br />
There were mostly whoops from those in attendance. The rest were on the Mercedes Dealers team, who were behind in their work, and saw a day of productivity just vanish before their eyes. But the needs of the many must outweight the needs of the few &#8230; so happy we were.<br />
Productivity, suffice to say, disappeared while we awaited our 10:30 departure. This allowed me to get some more details out of the way. But before long, the PA sounded our call downstairs to board the busses. It was time to party.<br />
On the bus, no-one really knew what was going on &#8212; that, of course, was the point. We received our gifts (a pair of sunglasses, a buff, and a wristband that did something, though I&#8217;m not sure what), and the busses headed out to our first venue&#8230;<br />
The Southern Alberta Pioneer Memorial Lodge. Sounds impressive, but it&#8217;s little more than a restored hunting lodge and about an acre or so of ground. But it&#8217;s on a cliff overlooking the Elbow River, so it&#8217;s not too bad. Already set up were tables and chairs, the Bistro staff was already cooking lunch, and most importantly, the beer was already cold.<br />
Jay and I were to share emcee duties that day, but Jay (despite a flair for the dramatic) had a nasty case of stage fright. He gracefully ducked out and let me handle the various announcements. But this didn&#8217;t stop Jay and I from very quickly downing a couple of beers to try and take the nervousness off. (Jay moved a little faster than me, though.)<br />
After about 30 minutes, it was time to show my cards and let everyone know that I knew what was going on, and show to the company that people like me should never be let near a microphone.<br />
Suddenly, I developed a radio voice and became no better than the morning radio rock jockeys who get worked up at the slightest sound of anything. I had no idea where that all came from. It was a little creepy to say the least. But hey, strange things happen right out of the blue. (&#8216;Course, I wasn&#8217;t drinking that crap, I was into something much nicer.)<br />
The irony of all this was that in school, I *hated* giving presentations. I hated getting up in front of people. Public speaking was very, very bad. Yet here I was, completely comfortable in making an ass of myself, and actually surprised that people listened. It was &#8230; surreal.<br />
Lunch started and for a while people followed the rules of order. But soon, no-one cared, and everyone wanted to eat. Not a big deal &#8212; there was lots of opportunity, and lots of food. (I think we had leftovers.) I didn&#8217;t eat much, though &#8212; only enough to try offset all the beer I was putting back.<br />
After lunch came the Dinosaur Awards. These were presented by Di (the President) and Dan (the Senior Vice President of Client Services) to the original employees of Critical Mass, still with the company. The trophies were little clay statues of cartoon dinosaurs, each customized to the recipient (for example, our CTO &#8212; a former programmer &#8212; received one where the dinosaur was smashing computers).<br />
Following the awards ceremony, we started into the games. We had planned on holding a games to give people some time to enjoy watching each other act goofy. There are few people in our company who won&#8217;t give into the urge to act like an idiot from time to time.<br />
The first game was the Naughty Noodle Toss. Sounds worse than it is, but it&#8217;s still entertaining to watch. Basically, everyone stands in a circle. To some of these people are given two metre long &#8220;noodles&#8221;, which most people will recognize as swimming pool toys. These are slung between the legs. Noodles must then be passed to the person next to them without the use of their hands. A dropped noodle must be picked up without the use of the hands.<br />
And when everyone&#8217;s drunk (or at least slightly inebriated), it gets everyone laughing.<br />
We went through four games of this &#8212; three with two teams each (we had six teams in total), and one last game of the winning team of each of the previous three. It was quite a sight.<br />
The second game we played was the Single Shoe Scuttle. This one was even more nasty, though far less embarrassing. Everyone took off a shoe (or sandal, if that&#8217;s all they had), and placed it in a line. The team would then line up, and prepare to scramble around a small field with scattered dominoes. Two teams played at once, the winner was the team with the most dominoes. Although we did manage to play three games, we never got the grand championship, as we had to pack up and leave for the second venue.<br />
Normally, no-one would have known where we were going, but unfortunately, Ted (our founder and chairmain) accidentally let it slip that we would spend the rest of the day at The Whiskey (a bar a few blocks from the office). At this point, my last official announcing duties took place, and then we were off.<br />
We pretty much dominated the place. Everywhere you looked were CM employees with their buffs (worn a number of ways) and sunglasses. Getting even more drunk than at the Pioneer Lodge. But this was all part of the fun.<br />
Slowly, the sun started to set, and people drifted off. A few diehards stuck around until quite late, but I left earlier &#8212; around 9:30. Deciding I&#8217;d had too much fun (and beer) for one day, I opted for the trip home.<br />
To drink my body weight in water.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It was a hot night in Ottawa, following Stuart and Therese&#8217;s wedding. It was only going to get hotter. A lot hotter.<br />
The next day was 1 July, otherwise known as Canada Day. Otherwise known as the single biggest excuse to get horribly drunk and act like an idiot.<br />
Especially if you&#8217;re in Ottawa.<br />
My plans didn&#8217;t involve alcohol, though. They were much more simple: An outing with Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s family to see what could be found in our nation&#8217;s capital.<br />
My day started off, however, with a trip back out to Carp. This was for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Therese&#8217;s parents were holding a brunch / present opening for guests to the wedding.</li>
<li>I&#8217;d left my camera battery charger at the house.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brunch was perfect for the day I was about to face: Bagels, smoked salmon, and cream cheese (although I didn&#8217;t have any of that &#8212; cream cheese and I don&#8217;t get along for some reason). I took almost as many pictures of Therese and Stuart opening gifts as I had taken the day before. (The joys of copious amounts of storage in my camera.)<br />
Brunch ended fairly early, many people looking to driving back to whereever it was they came from, and others looking towards doing something for the rest of the day. For me, it was a return to Stefan and Rebecca&#8217;s and prepare for the rest of the day&#8217;s events roaming around downtown Ottawa.<br />
By the time I got back to the house, the temperature was already well into the 30s, and showed little sign of slowing down. From all the reports I heard on the radio, this was going to be a VERY hot day. (The next day, the radio joked that the temperature had gone to 216 degrees, or 36 without the humidex. In either case, it was just an inhumane (and generally unfriendly to animals, too) temperature for people to be out doing anything strenuous, which was exactly what about 300,000+ people were doing in the downtown/Hull area.)<br />
We parked in a lot to the southwest of Parliment Hill, from which we hoped to be able to make a quick escape after the fireworks were over. (Hey, you can at least hope.) And with that, we jumped from the air-conditioned truck into the sweltering heat of Canada Day.<br />
Wandering, albeit a little more slowly, we eventually found our way down to Wellington/Rideau, which had been cordoned off for pedestrian use. It was almost 2pm, and the larger shows wouldn&#8217;t start for a few hours, but already the streets were lined with revellers. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen so much red and white in my life.<br />
And that was just the pastey white folk with the sunburns.<br />
We made it down about as far as the Chateau Laurier when we ran into the first major busker, who was going to attempt a rope walk on a portable rope-walking apparatus. The guy&#8217;s show was nearly completely based on the lead-up. The actual rope walk was completely anti-climactic, but a good showman will always leave people entertained. Barely into his show, he was tapped on the shoulder by a woman who asked him (he had a loudspeaker) to ask if there was a doctor in the audience &#8212; a young girl had passed out in the heat.<br />
Yes, it was that hot. I guess I needn&#8217;t mention the thick layer of sunscreen protecting us (most of us, anyway, Stefan doesn&#8217;t like the stuff).<br />
Now quite damp from the steady stream of sweat (and the show over), we started hunting around for the next great thing to see. As it happens, we passed the Photography Gallery (adjacent to the Chateau Laurier). At first, we weren&#8217;t going to go in, but the guard had quite the draw:<br />
&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen! Please take advantage of your nation&#8217;s free and *air-conditioned* museums this Canada Day!&#8221;<br />
The museum was small, pretty empty on the upper level, but much cooler. We took our time before running back outside.<br />
We headed into Majors Hill Park to see what interesting things could be found. The first was a welcome relief to everyone suffering in the great outdoor furnace: a Spray Zone. This is nothing fancy, no more than a hose hooked into the city water supply and bent into a two metre arch. Anyone walking under the spray got quite wet &#8212; which was perfect for us. We nearly took permanent refuge under there.<br />
Barely into the park, Rebecca pretty much insisted that I get some water before I started keeling over from dehydration and sunstroke. Unable to drink from the two camelback water pouches they brought (although offered, I declined due to nursing a mild cold), I purchased a pair of bottles from a vendor. There weren&#8217;t too expensive, and would keep me relatively well hydrated for the day.<br />
Eric took the opportunity to refill his now nearly empty water gun with the ice-cold water. Eric had probably brought it along as a joke, trying to annoy everyone else. However, it kind of backfired on him when we continually asked him to hose us down so we could try and keep cool. Although it was a fair bit of fun when Stefan managed to periodically steal the pistol and turn the tables on the lad.<br />
But Eric wasn&#8217;t the only one with a water gun. Shortly after one of the various busker shows, we walked into the cross-fire of a man slinging what can only be described as a water bazooka. I think the stream was about an inch in diametre. Rebecca got shot square in the face, but didn&#8217;t seem to mind one bit.<br />
The park area was filled with various little booths and shows (including an extreme sports aerial demonstration), and lots of people. Onward we trudged, watching the various buskers (none of whom were particularly interesting), before finding ourselves getting on a shuttle bus for Hull.<br />
The &#8220;National Captial Region&#8221; is not just the Ontario side. It includes Hull as well, so naturally, there were events on the other side. Of particular importance was the children&#8217;s area, complete with play areas, air-filled bounce rooms, and L&#8217;Ecole du Cirque, who set up a pair of trampolines, a pair of trapezes, and some other circus-related equipment so children of all ages could enjoy themselves.<br />
In the oppressive heat.<br />
Eric and Thea (Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s kids) made full use of the facilities, as did Stefan when he tried to ride a unicycle. He wasn&#8217;t horribly successful, but did learn that it made for a great upper thigh exercise trying to stay balanced.<br />
After the kids had run the course of the circus, we started heading back. Or rather, we would have were it not for curiousity, which drew us over to the Museum of Civilization. As nothing was immediately visible, we headed back over the bridge (sans autobus) to the Ottawa side. We took our time over the middle, as the breeze there was cooling enough to make the trip bearable.<br />
As we started to cross the bridge, Eric announced, to our partial dismay, that the water gun was broken. The pump used to pressurize the vessel had apparently blown a seal. Had Stefan a screwdriver, it would have been fixed in a jiffy. But with only his wits and a pocket of keys, cracking the gun open for repairs was outside of his ability. We would be waterless for the rest of the day.<br />
Once reaching the other side, we found that the pathway down to the Rideau Canal and locks was blocked off for &#8220;security reasons&#8221;. Probably meant they didn&#8217;t want to worry about some yutz getting too close to the fireworks. Within a few steps, however, the heat had become unbearable. We needed to cool off.<br />
Despite objections from the kids, we ducked into the National Art Gallery. Almost instantly, we felt our sanity returning as the cool air slowly stripped away the veneer of heat-spawned exhaustion. It took nearly 45 minutes before we were ready to brave the great outdoors again. Our brave, energized burst outdoors came to a slow crawl within five metres of the door, as the oven-like air burned off our veneer of cool-enduced enthusiasm<br />
We wandered back through Majors Hill Park and climbed the stairs back to Wellington St. The stairwell was completely covered in chalk drawings from someone who had left large pieces of street chalk all over the place. Thea grabbed a piece, and from the Chateau Laurier, across Wellington, down the stairs at the NAC, down the sidewalk next to the Canal, and all the way into Confederation Park, Thea would walk about five feet, stoop down and draw a happy face.<br />
Had I not managed to sort out my differences with the RCMP and CSIS earlier in the day, I would have been an easy person to follow.<br />
Confederation Park was the location of interesting food &#8230; well, more interesting than the plethora of hotdogs and sausages available about every 10 metres along most of the roads. Here was Egyptian, Japanese (sorry, but as much as I love sushi, there are things I will not touch in that heat), Indian, and something else I can&#8217;t remember now. I ended up having (rather spicy) butter chicken and a samosa (love those things). I almost got lucky and had myself dunked in ice-cold water when the clerk at the counter emptied out their pop bucket. Had I been actually thinking, I would have shoved my head under the stream &#8230; all I got was my foot.<br />
We sat in the shade of a large tree and tried to relax. Even with a setting sun, the heat was still intense. We opted to wait for Reggae Cowboys to start, hoping that they&#8217;d be at least somewhat entertaining. (They were at best tolerable.) The real stars of the stage were Samba Ottawa, a band what would be quite at home at Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. Despite being almost entirely white folk, they played a mean beat that had everyone tapping something. Admittedly, though, I ended up watching a young woman (early 20s, I imagine), who had curves like an hourglass and rhythm that could kill. The fact that she was uber-cute certainly added to the appeal. For a short time, I forgot how hot it was.<br />
I dunno what it is about people of Spanish or Portugese decent, but they really know how to mambo&#8230;<br />
Extracating ourselves from the park around 8:15, we found our way to Parliment Hill, and forced our way into the crowd. Stefan and I held back a bit while Rebecca and the kids moved ahead into a small clear spot. But we could all see just fine.<br />
The show was basically four bands: The Arrogant Worms (who did double duty as emcees), two French bands, and David Usher (formerly of Moist). The Worms played their songs in between the sets of the other bands, including their biggest pro-national hits, &#8220;Rocks and Trees&#8221; (really quite humourous in a large crowd setting), and &#8220;Canada&#8217;s Really Big&#8221;.<br />
I don&#8217;t know what it is with French bands, but they always seem to have guys who look as old as the Rolling Stones, or play the same song five times over. Okay, maybe I can&#8217;t hear French language as well as I should (damn the public school system!), but even musically it&#8217;s not too hard to VARY A NOTE OR TWO. And the singer in one band made Leonard Cohen look like a vocal genius.<br />
And I have to admit, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of David Usher. I&#8217;ve heard his songs, they&#8217;re okay, but they really don&#8217;t rock my boat. But hey, it&#8217;s a free live show, and I wasn&#8217;t about to complain. And admittedly, he put on a good show. And I do have to say, he knows how to end it.<br />
The last song of the night was announced this way:<br />
&#8220;Wow! You&#8217;re a great audience! [Crowd cheers loudly.] But every good party needs a little Ozzy!&#8221;<br />
Yes, Ozzy as in Ozzy Osbourne. Sure enough, his band started playing the beginning to &#8220;Crazy Train&#8221;. Now I&#8217;m not a huge fan of Ozzy, either. I like a couple of his songs, but I&#8217;ll be unable to name &#8217;em. Usher managed to mix the music scores from two Ozzy songs, and then overlaid different lyrics, specifically &#8220;Get This Party Started&#8221; by Pink.<br />
Sounds weird, I know, but wouldn&#8217;t ya know it &#8212; they go together really well. (Expect it on Dave&#8217;s next album.)<br />
Following that were the ubiquitous fireworks, a requirement of every Canada Day celebration. Had we been on the Quebec side of the river, I suspect the fireworks would have been amazing. On the south side of the Parliment Buildings, however, they ain&#8217;t so hot &#8212; we could only really see the high ones.<br />
Fireworks over, the five of us stalled a bit while the rest of the crowd of probably 500,000+ filtered out into the night. We took our time, found a stall with sausages (we were pretty hungry), and eventually found the car. Getting out of the downtown, however, was another story.<br />
Traffic, as one might expect, as a disaster. The police had blocked off certain roads that Stefan wanted to take so we could make a quick escape. This, suffice to say, frustrated him immensely. But it ended up directing us over to Marnie&#8217;s apartment (a friend of Stefan and Rebecca) who accompanied us on our trip back to Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s house. There we took refuge in the cool basement to relax a little.<br />
The next morning, following a quick visit to the National Museum of Science and Technology (I wanted to get pictures of the locomotives they have there), I braved the trip back to Toronto, at fairly high speed. I wasn&#8217;t keen on getting caught in traffic.<br />
It was hot.<br />
Really hot.<br />
And to top it all off, I got a sunburn.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There comes a time in your life when things start getting a lot more adult than you&#8217;re normally used to. For me, it was when my friends started getting married. But I didn&#8217;t really start getting self-conscious about it until this past weekend.<br />
On 30 June 2002, I had the honour of attending the wedding of two of my closest and dearest friends, Stuart and Therese. (They were marrying each other. Added bonus: I only had to buy one gift.)<br />
Although Therese and Stuart currently live in Calgary, the majority of their family lives in Ontario. The entire affair was held at Therese&#8217;s parent&#8217;s house in Carp, about a 25 km drive from downtown Ottawa. It would mean, for me, a trip back east, back to Ottawa for (another) summer wedding, and a chance to meet with old friends.<br />
I flew out on the 28th, flying to Hamilton via WestJet. (I&#8217;ve formally sworn off Tango &#8212; they might have cheaper fares than WestJet, but their total lack of service is enough to keep me going to WestJet. And I ain&#8217;t the only one.) Arriving late, I had to catch a cab to my mom&#8217;s house in Oakville. It&#8217;s not exactly a cheap cab ride.<br />
But stay in Oakville I didn&#8217;t &#8212; the next morning, after rising, showering, and running a couple of errands, I headed out to Ottawa. It had been five and a half years since I drove to Ottawa, and I was actually looking forward to the trip. (Or I would have, if the stupid tape deck in the car had accepted the cassette adapter so I could play my MiniDisc through the radio.) But all in all, it could have been worse &#8230; the radio could have been broken.<br />
I left Oakville almost an hour and a half late. And I paid for that delay, too. Although I shot down the QEW, the Gardner Expressway, and up the DVP without trouble, I had forgotten the cardinal rule of long weekends in Southern Ontario:<br />
Leave early, or sit in traffic.<br />
I got partway into Scarborough when my blunder came to fruition. Hard traffic. Really hard. And it lasted all the way out to Whitby. A drive that would normally take about 30 minutes took well over two hours.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t take much to remind me of the reasons I no longer like Southern Ontario, especially in the summer. Topmost on my list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Traffic (especially rush hour or long weekend)</li>
<li>Heat (especially when combined with humidity)</li>
<li>Smell (especially when stuck in traffic when it&#8217;s really hot)</li>
</ol>
<p>Traffic didn&#8217;t really clear up until almost Kingston. Needless to say, I found out that Dad&#8217;s Chevy Cavalier can do 130 km/h without difficulty at all.<br />
Not having driven in Ottawa since about 1996, I had never taken the 416 before. This was a vast improvement on the old Highway 16, which was a deathtrap in winter, and just took too long the rest of the time. My speed barely slowing, I found myself in Ottawa in about the same amount of time it would have taken me on Highway 7, and without hitting traffic.<br />
Unlike the majority of others, I would not check into a hotel during my stay. Instead, I was invited to stay with my friends Stefan and Rebecca. As I would not be hanging out with Stuart and Therese the entire time, this was a chance for me to catch up with them, and hopefully have some fun.<br />
I soon found that my memory of their house&#8217;s location was a little off, and I ended up having to call for directions. Fortunately, I wasn&#8217;t too far off, so it only took a couple of minutes to show up. (Now I know exactly where the house is.)<br />
Rebecca was there (Stefan was off getting supplies to begin home renovations), so we chatted a while before everyone else came home. Deciding that the sticky heat of an early Ottawa summer was not exactly comfortable, we decided that maybe air-conditioned entertainment was more appropriate. It was movie time&#8230;<br />
Ottawa, like many other cities in Canada, is suffering from movie theatre overload. Theatres that were considered luxurious only a few years ago are now waning, becoming second-run &#8220;cheapie&#8221; theatres. (Oakville doesn&#8217;t even have a Famous Players or Cineplex anymore &#8212; only AMC exists in town, and only on the very east end.) The theatre we were in will be a cheapie in the next six months, we guessed.<br />
Although Minority Report is an excellent film, the lack of air conditioning in the theatre didn&#8217;t make the movie any better. In fact, we couldn&#8217;t wait to get out of the movie so we could cool down after a while. I just made a point of not moving during the 2.5+ hour show.<br />
The movie over, Rebecca, Stefan, and I opted to retreat to the relative wildness of the Bytown Market, the favoured hangout of the young and reckless. During the school year, this is where you can find the majority of post-secondary students in the National Capital Region. During the summer &#8230; well, I don&#8217;t really know where they all come from, but there&#8217;s a lot of &#8217;em.<br />
We wandered around, trying to find a place that had nice margaritas and not too long a lineup. It took us a while, but eventually we found the right place. But by then, it was nearly closing time. So we downed what we had, and made way for home.<br />
The next day was the Big Day. But it wouldn&#8217;t start for me until 3:30 that afternoon. We started the morning with breakfast at a nearby restaurant. Then it was a leisurely return home, a long shower, and a very careful dressing. (Although I had to borrow one of Stefan&#8217;s undershirts to prevent nasty perspiration stains from finding their way to my shirt.)<br />
Did I mention that it was borderline insanely hot?<br />
Ottawa, like Southern Ontario, gets very warm in the summer. The temperature was in the low 30s, which in itself is quite warm. However, on top of that is the humidity, which cranks the perceived temperature to something like 45. (This is all Celsius, by the way.)<br />
The trip out to Carp was a relatively easy one, even though I hadn&#8217;t been there for at least six years &#8212; probably longer. Luckily, I remembered something about the Crazy Horse Saloon, which marked where I had to turn. After that, it was just a matter of finding the right house. It wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8212; there was only one wedding on the street that day.<br />
The Holton household was a flurry of activity, and I was one of the first to show. (Actually, I was asked by Therese and Stuart to arrive a little early. I had certain duties they wanted me to fulfill.) Therese was not quite at the panic stage yet, and seemed to be handling everything very well. Mrs. Holton seemed quite well off, as did Mr. Holton. Danica (Therese&#8217;s sister) was completely at ease. Stuart, who was roaming about, seemed a little nervous, but had planned everything out so well that he seemed barely fazed by the whole event to come.<br />
Before long, the guests started appearing in droves. Some people, such as Stuart&#8217;s parents, I hadn&#8217;t seen in a while. Others, such as Jay, Matt, and Nabil, I had seen more recently, coincidentally at another wedding (Jay&#8217;s, to be specific). Then there were people from Guelph (where Therese when to university) that I hadn&#8217;t seen in almost six years. And then&#8230; well, the list is fairly lengthy. Suffice to say, it was good to see all.<br />
I took my place in the front row of the guest seats, where I could get a good view of the ceremony. Stuart and Therese trusted me to take some of the key photos (I really hope they turn out), so I had to be in a place where I could see them. I also had to cue the music at the right times, and still try to look like I was just a guest. Juggling two cameras ain&#8217;t easy, especially when you don&#8217;t have the luxury of telling people not to move.<br />
The sound of bagpipes soon wafted through the trees and under the tents &#8212; Stuart walked through the garden path, up the aisle, and to his place on the deck. After a few moments, the tune changed (and no, not to &#8220;The Marriage of Figaro&#8221; &#8212; although that would have been rather interesting on the bagpipes), and Therese walked her way up to take her place next to Stuart.<br />
Then came the moment that 10 years ago I dreaded, that for the last four years have been expecting, and for the last six months, had truly hoped would be their happiest day. The ceremony began.<br />
Stuart was dressed in his fine kilt (his family is Scottish), but donned a lavender-blue button-down shirt with a matching silk tie. Therese&#8217;s dress was a matte silver silk with spaghetti string straps. Her hair was up (a rarity for her), with a small tiara to tie it all together. Although the tiara had been a bit of a joke when she first acquired it, when Therese walked up onto the deck, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of Audrey Hepburn in &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8221;. It had been a very long time since the last time, but I was envious of Stuart.<br />
The feeling passed quickly, though, and I was swept into the affair. It was simple, quiet, and exactly what I&#8217;d expect from Therese and Stuart &#8212; complete with a bit of humour when Therese stumbled across one of her lines, and teary when Therese had trouble getting another out through her half-sobs of joy. This was truly a happy day.<br />
The ceremony was short, but sweeter than the most luxurious sugar. Okay, yeah, that sounds cheesy, but you gotta understand &#8212; this is the first wedding I actually cried at. Until then, I didn&#8217;t really get the joke: &#8220;I always cry at weddings.&#8221;<br />
The vows were exchanged, as were rings, and before we knew it, came the kiss. I was so overwhelmed with everything that I almost forgot the music cue.<br />
Therese and Stuart adjourned to a small table to sign away their lives, so to speak. Pictures were taken in spades. The Music Gods smiled on Stuart and Therese that day &#8212; the first song in the queue (Tom Petty&#8217;s &#8220;Wildflowers&#8221; finished just as they returned to centre stage, to be pronounced (offically) husband and wife. As they left, I skipped to the fifth song, the one they wanted to play as they finished and left the stage, The Beatles&#8217; &#8220;All You Need Is Love&#8221;.<br />
The crowd moved to the front yard, where the majority of the &#8220;formal&#8221; photographs were taken. There was no professional photographer, Therese and Stuart were relying on the rest of us shutterbugs to get the photographs. I was entrusted a little further with Stuart&#8217;s manual camera (which, thankfully, he&#8217;d already preset for use) &#8212; I only pray that the pictures I took meet with his approval.<br />
Pictures wrapped up, the party slowly began as people started to filter over to the tent again (a group of us had moved the chairs around and put up tables during the picture session &#8212; I was supposed to coordinate it, but I got caught up in the photos). Drinks came out (well, they&#8217;d been out for a while, but they came out a bit faster now), and people started mingling.<br />
While people mingled, we had one problem to solve. In all our haste, we had forgotten the head table. There wasn&#8217;t one. But luckily, there were enough people to solve the problem &#8212; two small tables could seat eight, and suddenly everyone was happy again.<br />
By the time table started in to get their meals, we had to start lighting the citronella lamps to try and cut down on the armada of mosquitos that were started to thin out the available blood supply.<br />
Dinner was wonderfully simple: Salads, poached salmon, and a hot buffet that included roast beef. It successfully covered everyone&#8217;s tastes and desires &#8230; especially those of us who love a variety.<br />
Dinner completed, people began to mingle again. Slowly at first, some moving into the house to escape the invasion of airborne bloodsuckers, others taking their leave and heading home (or to their respective hotels). Dancing was informal, and not really long-lived. Although the constant movement kept the mosquitos at bay a little better, not everyone was completely comfortable in the unbearable heat. (Even afer the sun went down, it was still quite warm.)<br />
People began to dissipate like steam from a kettle over the next couple of hours. I was one of the last to leave. I returned to my car, and headed back towards Rebecca and Stefan&#8217;s.<br />
As I drove in the cool(er) silence of the night, I thought about the day&#8217;s proceedings. Yes, things had changed. Stuart and Therese were no longer just friends, or partners, or significant others. They, like many of my friends, were now married. Life was again moving forward, in its inexorable march forward. And while I was so happy that their wedding had been a joyous one, there was that slightly ominous undertone of the finality of life, that this is an event that I will witness but once.<br />
But that&#8217;s why I take pictures, so I can relive the moment any time I want. And it&#8217;s why I write these journals, so I can also remember my thoughts and feelings.<br />
Congratulations, my dear friends. May your marriage bring you joy, prosperity, and the sound of little feet.<br />
And I ain&#8217;t referring to your cats.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I remember when I used to have time to kick back, relax, and spend an afternoon watching TV.<br />
I think I was five.<br />
This weekend past was yet another in a string of busy, hectic times. As June rolls towards a close, many things are coming up that need to be tackled. Two things of particular importance: Turning my apartment back over to the building, and getting ready for Therese and Stuart&#8217;s wedding.<br />
The former meant I had to spend a large portion of Saturday in my apartment trying to clean the last of it up. Now, if I was smart, I would have started out first thing in the morning. However, me being the idiot I am, decided that I also needed to make a run to the local Humungous Hardware Store to find something things I needed around the house (pliers, a Dremel, garden hose and nozzle, propane tank, branch cutters (I have some very overgrown bushes), and so on and so forth).<br />
Having wasted a couple of hours doing that, I quickly stopped off at home before heading over to the apartment to clean. First was a run through the bathroom, trying to get a weird stain out of the bathtub (now mostly gone, thanks to CLR) and make everything sparkle. Then it was off to the kitchen to mop floors, etc. so I could move the last of the boxes off the carpets. It was time for the Rug Doctor.<br />
Now, the apartment management doesn&#8217;t seem to like Rug Doctors. I have no idea why. But frankly, I don&#8217;t give a damn what they think &#8212; I needed one for the house anyway, and figured taking a couple of hours to run it through the apartment first couldn&#8217;t hurt.<br />
Chris, you&#8217;ll be glad to know all those stains we accumulated (thanks to a certain cat) are now gone.<br />
The carpets are now cleaner than when I first moved in. But the managers will probably still complain that I didn&#8217;t get a professional in there and demand that I do. I swear, some people are just plain silly with requirements sometimes.<br />
But it wasn&#8217;t money wasted &#8212; I wanted a Rug Doctor for the house, too. I never got a chance to clean the carpets before moving in, and I knew full well that the previous owner didn&#8217;t clean &#8217;em on her way out. Upon arrival at the house, I quickly realized that the stairs would be nigh on impossible for me to clean with just the machine &#8212; it was too big for the small spaces. I needed an attachment.<br />
Calgary has a lot of Safeways. I&#8217;m not sure why, but there are times when that comes in really handy. For example, I rented the actual Rug Doctor from the Safeway that was nearest to my apartment. My house, however, is only two and a half blocks from a different Safeway. So, wandering over to my &#8220;new&#8221; grocery store, I negotiated a rental for the upholstery attachment. The clerks were a little confused at first when I told them what I did, but the senior clerk on staff promptly smiled, handed me the bag of hose and cleaning nozzle, and asked that I merely return it before the store closed. No charge.<br />
I love this city.<br />
I swear that the previous owner never cleaned anything. She might as well have been a renter for all she did. The yard&#8217;s a mess, the kitchen&#8217;s not in the best of shape, the dishwasher is probably beyond repair now, the washer/dryer is so poorly installed that it goes off-balance constantly, the house needs repainting, every bush and tree is overgrown, the garage is literally falling apart, the shingles need replacing, and the carpets were completely, utterly, and totally filthy.<br />
They didn&#8217;t look filthy, at first glance, but after running the Doctor over them, I felt a little ill.<br />
Chris and I vaccummed fairly regularly in our apartment (okay, sometimes not, but we tried to be regular). But we had friends over all the time, tracking in dirt (particularly in the winter) from everywhere (we did the same, of course). You&#8217;d think with such high traffic, that our carpets would be dirty. They were. But the water I emptied in the apartment didn&#8217;t even come close to the sheer sludge I was emptying from the carpets in the house.<br />
Ew.<br />
I finished the day off with a steak dinner (my reward for being utterly exhausted) &#8230; the first made in my new barbecue, a housewarming present I got from my realtor. (Did I mention that she is absolutely awesome?) Although I did have to figure out why it wasn&#8217;t working properly, so my dinner was delayed until almost 23:30.<br />
The next day, I tried to start off early, so I could get those rogue boxes out of my apartment and over to the house. So much for plans.<br />
I arrived at Stuart and Therese&#8217;s house a little later than planned, but not terribly late. Sunday was not only Father&#8217;s Day but also their wedding shower. A bittersweet day for me, if there ever was one. Although, I do have to say that some of Dad&#8217;s humour managed to find me. When asked by someone who doesn&#8217;t really know me: &#8220;Have you called your father today?&#8221;, I replied (with a big, dopey grin): &#8220;Can&#8217;t &#8212; I&#8217;d need to do a seance.&#8221; Next year, though, I&#8217;ll use someone else&#8217;s idea: &#8220;Not yet &#8212; can you gimme a hand with this ouija board?&#8221;<br />
We drove down to Lakeview Golf Course (a city course) to participate in Stuart&#8217;s end of the shower. (Therese was holding a pottery session. The problem for me was that I was torn between them both. Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to choose &#8212; I was assigned Stuart by someone else.) Right by the biggest water trap in the city (the Glenmore Reservoir), it was a little out of the way (Stuart and I had some trouble initially finding the place), but an otherwise great place to be.<br />
We broke into one group of four, and two groups of three. (The groups of three had extra people thrown in to round out the foursome.) I played in the last group with Stuart and Heather, the roommate of (a different) Geoff, one of Therese&#8217;s friends from her psychology classes. (Geoff and Stuart are good friends, too, of course.) Most of the others in the crowd were former (or current) friends from Stuart&#8217;s office(s).<br />
I vaguely remembered my last outing in golf, on the Canadian Forces Base Comox golf course when Gerry and I were visiting his uncle in September 1997. I remembered how badly I sucked. I definitely haven&#8217;t improved since then.<br />
Although I had a few good hits, they rarely went in the direction I wanted them to. And I was definitely not good on the greens. I&#8217;m used to BC greens, which are wet and really slow. Calgary greens are faster than a chuckwagon race. It took me nine holes just to get the hang of &#8217;em.<br />
But I shot a 61 overall, nonetheless. Before you get too impressed with the score, though, please understand that it was only a nine-hole course.<br />
I shot 27 on the first three holes alone.<br />
The tournament over (myself winning with the largest score, though the other Geoff wasn&#8217;t far behind), we adjourned to Jack Astor&#8217;s out in Westhills for the 19th hole.<br />
We broke up a little before 16:00, Stuart and I having to make a run to Mission to pick up Leah (one of Therese&#8217;s classmates), run by Therese and Stuart&#8217;s house (to get a video camera and so Stuart could change), and then way up into Tuscany (in the distant northwest corner of Calgary) for the shower.<br />
By now, I know most of people who were there (I&#8217;ve been invited to enough soirees that include Therese&#8217;s classmates that I&#8217;m reasonably familiar to them), so I didn&#8217;t feel too out of place. Besides, they&#8217;re all really nice people, so it doesn&#8217;t take much to get to know them.<br />
After a quick meal, we sat down to watch the present opening. I sat on the stairs and took pictures (which wasn&#8217;t easy, with the lighting and angles I had to work with). As I sat there, I had glimpses of the past, going back to high school and early university, when Therese and Stuart were dating. I felt vaguely uncomfortable again, like I was an unwanted outsider.<br />
I have no idea what brought that on. Stuart and Therese are two of my closest, most trusted friends. They&#8217;re the sort of people I have no reservations about helping, or asking for help. Sometimes, I swear the human mind is a scary, unforgiving place.<br />
Or it could just be me.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The last thing I really needed was a cat underfoot as people were rapidly moving things out of the apartment. It wouldn&#8217;t be good for them, and it really wouldn&#8217;t be good for Miao-Yin. This, in my opinion, was the worst part of the entire moving process.<br />
On Saturday afternoon (1 June 2002), I returned to the apartment to gather the cat&#8217;s things, and then gather the cat. Gathering her items was easy &#8212; a shopping bag, her food dishes, food, combs, brushes, and so forth. Then came the fun part: Getting Miao-Yin in the kitty carrier.<br />
It seems that most cats actually like kitty carriers &#8230; at least until they&#8217;re locked inside them. Miao-Yin doesn&#8217;t even like going inside hers. When Chris first brought her home from the Humane Society, he told me of how much she yowled the whole way &#8212; the cardboard box hadn&#8217;t really been her thing. After a while, Chris had the joy of taking Miao-Yin to the vet (for checkups, etc.), and had to use the box. Somehow, he managed to get her in.<br />
Eventually, Chris bought a proper kitty carrier. Miao-Yin wouldn&#8217;t even go near it at first. Chris hit upon the idea of putting her food dish inside it so she&#8217;d have to go in. Brilliant move &#8212; and it worked very well. It wasn&#8217;t to hard locking her inside, even though she&#8217;d always keep her hind feet outside the cage so she could back up if someone tried to close the door (never worked, she&#8217;d always end up inside).<br />
With all this training in mind, moving Miao-Yin should have been easy, right?<br />
Rule #1: Cats always know what you&#8217;re going to do before you do it.<br />
What should have been a 10 second job turned into a 20 minute epic ordeal. A battle between man and beast for dominance. A realization that trying to put a cat into a carrier is like forcing a water balloon into a Coke bottle.<br />
But I eventually won, but not before one of Miao-Yin&#8217;s rear claws slashed the very heel of my left hand. Luckily, it was at an angle, else I might have needed stitches. She yowled the whole way, sounding as miserable as possible. She wanted it abundantly clear that she did not want to be in that carrier.<br />
When I finally released her in the house, it felt like returning a rehabilitated animal to its natural habitat. She slowly put her head out, looked, sniffed, and then bolted downstairs and disappeared. She was still exploring the basement when I brought down the litter box. The first thing she did when she saw it was use it. I&#8217;ll assume that&#8217;s a good thing. (At least, I haven&#8217;t been finding little presents all over the place.)<br />
With Miao-Yin squared away, I finished assembling the barbecue (see [[Annual General Meeting, Taking Possession of my House]]) and put it off to one side. I figured we&#8217;d need the kitchen space. I then left Miao-Yin to investigate the house on her own, and returned to finish packing.<br />
I had been packing all week, when I got home from work. It looked pretty straight-forward, and there was nothing that set off alarm bells for me. It was now only just over a day before things started heading out the door. I didn&#8217;t have that much left. I didn&#8217;t see a problem.<br />
Which is probably why I didn&#8217;t think much of it when Stuart and I went out for dinner and to see a movie. (As an side note, the Jack Astor&#8217;s restaurant chain has basically hit rock-bottom. From previously having the best staff in the biz, they&#8217;ve all become inattentive, distant, and boring. As much as I hate to say it, I won&#8217;t likely go back. As it stands Stuart and I didn&#8217;t even eat there &#8212; we left after they left us waiting in the booth for 20 minutes.)<br />
When I got back, I had to finish packing. And I did. Around 7:00am. (Chris, for the record, we have way more stuff than we thought we did.)<br />
That allowed me some precious sleep time. Not that I got a lot &#8212; I was completely wired on Coke and adrenaline, so what sleep I did get was quite fitful. At 8:30, I pulled myself up off the couch (the last time I&#8217;ll ever sleep on them, I&#8217;m happy to say) and looked outside. The previous day&#8217;s forecast had been partly cloudy, with a 40% chance of rain.<br />
The 40% lasted all day. (I felt like I was living in Vancouver again.) At least it didn&#8217;t snow&#8230;<br />
At 8:50, I went over to feed Miao-Yin, and then up the Northeast to get the moving truck. (One of the last ones in the city on what seems to be the busiest moving days of the year.)<br />
At 10:05am, I arrived at my apartment, having picked up Tamara from her apartment, and met up with both Fritz and Doug, arriving with their McDonald&#8217;s breakfast in hand. Tamara promptly bolted off for breakfast, while I started to try and organize. Over the course of the next hour, Teak, Rose, my cousin Darren, Stuart, Darren&#8217;s and my Uncle Mike, and Kaz showed up to assist (though Teak had to run off and pick up Kaz).<br />
At first, the move was slow. Because I couldn&#8217;t book an elevator for 10am on a Sunday, we had to grab whatever elevator came down. Figuring this was not going to be an easy move without a dedicated elevator, we packed what we could and kept going. Luckily, as I was emptying out the second load into the lobby, I spotted one of the maintenance workers in the building, and begged to lock off #3 elevator so we could move. He was more than helpful, and that got us moving into high gear.<br />
Fritz, Doug, and Tamara moved items from the apartment to the elevator. Darren ran the elevator, and helped unload at the bottom. The rest of us moved items from the lobby to the truck, and reorganized everything inside. The process was far easier than I ever could have imagined. (And a lot easier than moving a certain cat, let me tell you.)<br />
By about 11:20, we&#8217;d worked our way down to the really large and bulky stuff: the beds, the TV, and the couches. That&#8217;s about when things started going awry&#8230;<br />
I had called on Friday to see what bookings I could get for Sunday morning. The person I had talked to said that no bookings were available until 3pm (which was far too late for my liking). I asked if all the morning slots were taken &#8212; I was told that you couldn&#8217;t book before noon, and had to wing it if you wanted. I said I would, and was told if I found a maintenance worker, I could lock of #3 (and so I dispel the belief that I&#8217;m really intelligent when I asked the maintenance worker to lock off #3).<br />
But&#8230;<br />
Someone forgot to tell the weekend manager, who promptly freaked all over Fritz, Doug, and Darren (Tamara and her mother were organizing Tamara&#8217;s things at her apartment). Threats of taping the door, calling the cops, and going to court started circulating. (Needless to say, I&#8217;ve never really been a huge fan of this particular manager.)<br />
When the manager arrived at the lobby, I did a hasty explanation of what happened, and that I&#8217;d forgotten to pay my June rent (which was true &#8212; I had). She simply told me to go to the office when I was done. For a moment, I felt like I was in grade school again&#8230;<br />
The move complete (five minutes ahead of schedule), I explained in detail the manager what had happened. It seemed that she understood, and was more than happy to take my money for June. But the grief was finally over and done with &#8212; the apartment mostly emptied, and the two worst couches that I&#8217;ve ever had were disposed of.<br />
Then we were off to Tamara&#8217;s, where we acquired a mini-freezer, a small couch, bed (mattress, box spring, and frame), dresser, several boxes of dry foodstuffs, more CDs (as if I didn&#8217;t have enough for four or five people), and various other things. The truck (a large cube van) was full. We had to resort to putting the couch and my bike into Uncle Mike&#8217;s pickup truck (which, thankfully, had a cab over the bed).<br />
Then it was over to the house. Luckily, either the rain, the Sunday, or some fluke of nature freed up parking spots in front of the house. It was a minor thing to park the truck and start unloading. Of course, that&#8217;s also when it started to rain harder.<br />
Figures.<br />
But in about 30 minutes, we emptied both trucks, and filled the living room, dining room, and kitchen with a lot of unrecognizable stuff. It&#8217;ll probably take Tamara and I about a week or two to sort all that out. A lot of it are Chris&#8217; things that I offered to store while he lives the high life in Japan. The fun part will be figuring out which is his.<br />
The actual move finally over, we celebrated with the most traditional of most post-moving repasts: Beer and pizza.<br />
Surprisingly enough, Miao-Yin weathered the move-in a lot better than I thought she would &#8212; I fully expected a lot of cowering in the basement from all the activity. But it didn&#8217;t seem to bother her too much. She spent most of her time at the downstairs stairwell, but regularly poked her head out to see what was going on. I already believe the move will be good for her.<br />
There are a couple of side-effects. First, I&#8217;m dead tired. (The not sleeping thing on Saturday probably didn&#8217;t help.) And my legs are about ready to declare themselves distinct societies and separate from my body. (In shorter terms, they hurt. A lot.)<br />
But I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m in the house. A little tidying, a little cleaning, and it&#8217;ll be a completely comfortable, liveable space. And that&#8217;s all I really wanted right from the beginning. The road might be long, windy, littered with potholes, but ultimately it goes somewhere. But admittedly, this is one time where the destination is more appreciated than the journey.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This was, to say the least, one of the busier weekends I&#8217;ve had in a long time. It was a very good weekend in many respects, not the least of which was actually (finally) getting my house. But it all kinda started this way&#8230;<br />
Saturday morning, 9:30am. After staying up a little late to do more packing (with a lot left still to do), I arose a little tired, but excited to tackle the day. I had three basic things to do: Attend the Rocky Mountain Rail Society&#8217;s Annual General Meeting in the south end of Calgary, take possession of my house, and finish packing. Looks fairly simple, right?<br />
But simple can be deceiving&#8230;<br />
I arrived about two minutes before the AGM was to start. Not a huge deal &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t the only straggler, and we didn&#8217;t actually get going until about 11:10am that morning anyway. That gave me time to set up the laptop with images of trains and steam locomotives that I&#8217;ve been taking for the last year. (I&#8217;ve got quite a few of them now.)<br />
I&#8217;ve never been to an annual meeting of any kind, and this was pretty much an eye-opener for me. Despite the fact that, amongst ourselves, the RMRS is pretty lax. We don&#8217;t have any hierarchy, we all joke/make fun of each other, bend rules to get things done, and avoid formality almost as if it were a disease. Until the AGM on Saturday morning, there was only one case I knew of where things were followed to the letter: Actually running 6060, at which point the half century of railroading rules and regulations take over, and are followed to the punctuation mark. The AGM was the second time.<br />
The first thing I noticed was that certain people (the Treasurer, the Membership Officer, the Secretary, and some of the Directors) wore name plates. The meeting was ordered, directed by the Chairman (who was elected at the end of the meeting to President, our last president having fulfilled his term and stepped down), recorded by the Secretary, and everyone coordinating it by referral of title (e.g. &#8220;Mr. Chairman&#8221;), even by the founders and most senior members.<br />
The meeting closed at 12:45pm, just in time for a catered lunch. This was great for me &#8212; I didn&#8217;t have a lot of food in the apartment, and I figured it would be a while before I&#8217;d be eating again (I had a lot of packing to do, and didn&#8217;t want to get too distracted).<br />
The meeting having more or less wrapped up by 2:00pm, I hopped in my car and drove out to Sunnyside to meet up with Robyn, my realtor. When I arrived at 2:30pm, she was already there. We took quick looks around the house, seeing what was in order, and what wasn&#8217;t.<br />
The main floor was in good condition. The floors were a little scratched (but to be expected with hardwood &#8230; I need to refinish them in a year or two anyway), and the walls had been repainted (or touched up) where items had removed from the walls. In the kitchen, there were three things slightly amiss.<br />
First, the hot water connection under the sink was still leaking (we identified this during the home inspection, and the previous owner was to have fixed it), there were still dishes in one of the cupboards (not sure if they&#8217;re forgotten or discarded), and there was a partially-assembled barbecue in the middle of the floor.<br />
Yes, a barbecue. Robyn had said from relatively early in our home purchasing relationship that she&#8217;d do this, because I&#8217;d directed a couple of people her way. I&#8217;d always kind of resisted this generosity, mostly because I didn&#8217;t think I deserved it. But there it was &#8230; in it&#8217;s partially-assembled glory (Robyn hadn&#8217;t finished putting it together yet).<br />
I said it before, and I&#8217;ll say it again: I&#8217;ve got the best realtor in town.<br />
We quickly toured the basement. A couple of boxes, but otherwise empty and no different than the last time I&#8217;d seen it. Nearly whacked my head again on the air ducts. (If I&#8217;m in there long enough, one of the things I&#8217;m going to do is drop that floor a couple of feet. Darren nearly decapitated himself when taking things down there on Sunday.)<br />
The upstairs had a couple of problems. The first was a series of stains in the north bedroom which I couldn&#8217;t remember having seen before, nor did Robyn, and we know it wasn&#8217;t mentioned during the home inspection, so we wonder if the inspector saw them. (Mind you, the previous owner did have screens and furniture there, so it&#8217;s possible she hid them from sight.)<br />
But the stains weren&#8217;t the worst part. As I looked just past the stains to the wall, I noticed a rather odd thing that ran right around the base of the walls. The baseboards. Or more specifically, the lack thereof.<br />
The previous owner had taken them. To paraphrase Tom Arnold in &#8220;True Lies&#8221;, what kind of sick freak takes the baseboards?!<br />
That one had Robyn and I completely stumped. I had to laugh. I mean, they&#8217;re baseboards: Cheap strips of painted wood. I&#8217;m actually amazed she managed to get them off without damaging the walls. But now I have to replace them, and I don&#8217;t really have the equipment at the moment. And that&#8217;s in addition to all the other things I have to do around the house.<br />
We adjourned outside to quickly inspect the exterior. I might need to paint this year, too. I&#8217;ll need to double check, but it should hopefully be not too bad. (Luckily, I don&#8217;t need to strip &#8212; all I need to do is paint over what&#8217;s already there.) The roof needs reshingling (but I knew that before) &#8212; if not this year, definitely next.<br />
And then there&#8217;s the garage. I have a funny feeling the last few tenants haven&#8217;t even bothered with going inside it. The door lock is broken, the walls are rotting, the roof sags and leaks, and the concrete pad is pretty much gone. But it&#8217;s a single car detached garage. A couple months with proper construction should replace it without too much difficulty. For now, I&#8217;ll just keep an eye on it. But sooner or later, I&#8217;ll need to do the actual work.<br />
Lastly, there&#8217;s the yard. The last owner was quite good at maintaining the interior of the house. The yard, however, was not her forte. Many parts are weeded over, saplings everywhere, and brown spots on some parts of the yard. It&#8217;s going to take a bit of work to clean all that up. I&#8217;ll leave the interior work until this winter, so I can clean that up now.<br />
But hey, I wanted a bit of a fixer-upper to begin with. So in retrospect, my initial desire still gets fulfilled &#8212; by the garage, if nothing else.<br />
A half hour after leaving, I was done. I had keys in hand, and was ready to return home and pack. The actual transfer of ownership, though, seemed lacking in something. Technically, all Robyn had to do was put keys in my hand. There was no fanfare, no celebration. Just &#8220;here&#8217;s your keys!&#8221;. Mind you, Robyn was pretty happy about it. But after five months of waiting, it was anti-climactic. It was almost, I shudder to say, empty.<br />
I returned to the apartment to resume packing and prepare for the move. But there was one thing I wanted to do first: Move Miao-Yin.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Warm weather has come late to Calgary, but it is quite a relief that it finally has. Shorts, sandals, t-shirts, and (almost) no fear of waking up to a White Christmas every morning. I haven&#8217;t seen my breath in well over a week, and if the forecasts are (reasonably) correct, I won&#8217;t see it again for a few months.<br />
Deciding that I needed to take a break or suffer the consequences, I make a mental note not to go into the office on the weekend past. Well, except for Saturday &#8212; but it wasn&#8217;t to do actual work. It was to finish construction on a site for the Toronto Railway Historical Committee (of which I&#8217;m on the Communications Committee) &#8212; www.trhc.ca. They&#8217;re (we&#8217;re) just getting off the ground, but the president has done much in a very short period of time.<br />
There&#8217;s a couple of weird bugs (only with Macs it seems), but for now it serves the purpose.<br />
After that, I adjourned home. To watch movies. Not having Chris around to talk with at home really brings me down sometimes.<br />
Sunday was significantly better, not only from an activity perspective, but also from a weather perspective. It was already well into the mid-teens when I left to wander around the Lilac Festival that was taking place on 4th Street, from 13th Ave. SW to Elbow Drive. Almost 15 blocks of street vendors, street performers, and about half of Calgary. Despite all the people, I found it almost impossible to walk up and down the street without a huge grin &#8212; outside, in the sun, and doing what could easily be construed as summer activities.<br />
My first stop along the way was at Sushi Kawa, at 4th St. and about 22nd Ave. Not only was I deeply in the throes of sushi withdrawal, it was a good chance to visit with Kaz, who works there.<br />
It was a bit of an odd experience going into a restaurant on my own. Sure, I&#8217;ve gone into fast food joints on my own before, but an actual restaurant &#8212; that&#8217;s a new one for me. But there are advantages in Japanese restaurants: Stools at the sushi counter.<br />
The road was beyond packed by the time I got back outside. But I pressed on, walking the length of the street to see anything of interest. Aside from a steel drum band (that actually made Enrique Iglesias sound good), a one man band that did a startling good rendition of Kurt Cobain, a belly dancer, and the living statues &#8230; it wasn&#8217;t all that thrilling. I kind of missed the Buskerfest in Ottawa during the summers. Far more entertaining.<br />
Reaching the other end of the road, I returned to the apartment to rest a while before heading over to Millennium Park for a free concert by the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra. The CPO, like many orchestras, is suffering from lack of interest. This was their attempt to make themselves better known, and hope that it will generate a little more revenue for them in the long run.<br />
It was really nice to sit on the grass (but watching for all the goose droppings) and listen to a good orchestra play live music. It was really good to really see the stereotypical view of Calgary being shed away as they played traditional English folk tunes, music from Les Mis, even a piece composed by the resident composer (which sounded not unlike a Stravinsky-influenced John Williams).<br />
Until they started playing fiddle music. So much for smashing stereotypes.<br />
They finished off with the theme from Star Wars. They did a pretty decent job of it, although I personally think the tempo was too fast.<br />
Concert over, I proceeded to wander around the river and see what there was to see. People were out skating, biking, jogging, walking, but most of all, enjoying the warmth. It&#8217;s been a chilly start to the year, and I think we&#8217;ll all very happy to have it a little nicer around here.<br />
And now that I&#8217;ve said that, we&#8217;re probably gonna have a blizzard on Sunday&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Long weekends are rarely long enough. I&#8217;d like one to last about a year, personally, but without all the seasonal changes. But I suppose that&#8217;s what Hawaii is for&#8230;<br />
My weekend (sort of) started on Thursday night, with the premiere of &#8220;Star Wars Episode Two: Attack of the Clones&#8221;. Although I&#8217;m still not sold on the title, I think the movie is a vast improvement over Episode One. And it&#8217;s gonna be a heck of a lead-in for Episode Three.<br />
One thing that was definitely missing this time was hype. True, hype can severely detriment a film. It can drag it down by setting expectations far too high. But at the same time, there&#8217;s such a powerful excitement that you really don&#8217;t care if the movie sucks or not &#8212; you just want to be there. While I can&#8217;t speak for either Therese or Stuart, I was a little disenchanted this time. Even when the words: &#8220;A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&#8230;&#8221; came up, and the audience went ballistic (I love opening night crowds), I didn&#8217;t feel that excited grin cross my face. It was almost as if I was just seeing another movie.<br />
Maybe I was, but wasn&#8217;t willing to accept it. Who knows &#8212; a few people have speculated that this hasn&#8217;t exactly been the best year for me: My father passing away, my workload and responsibility load increasing dramatically, and now Chris having left for Japan. (And we&#8217;re not even half-way through the year yet.) I suppose it&#8217;s entirely possible that the joy I should feel last left. Is it time for a change in lifestyle, perhaps? Well, I&#8217;ve got one coming soon&#8230;<br />
The date of closure of my house is coming soon. In less than two weeks, I&#8217;ll be in my &#8220;new&#8221; house. I had originally feared that the excitement I first felt upon buying the house would eventually dissipate, and I wouldn&#8217;t end up wanting to move. Thankfully, the last few days have shown me that I am not only ready to leave my apartment, but I can&#8217;t wait to move into the house. Right now, I need the patience of a Jedi just to keep from bursting my skin wanting to move in. I&#8217;ve started driving by the house, just to remind myself. At times, this still feels like a dream. Whether or not it turns out to be a nightmare remains to be seen&#8230;<br />
On Friday night, I was supposed to attend Star Wars with friends from the office. However, I had other plans &#8212; seeing friends I haven&#8217;t seen for a very long time: Ed and Jen. Ed is one of my friends from first year university, and was one of my roommates during my second year. Both years rank very highly in my best and most cherished memories. It had been over four years since I&#8217;d last seen Jen &#8212; about one and a half since I&#8217;d last seen Ed &#8212; and in both cases it had been far too long.<br />
They arrived on the 9:45pm flight from Toronto, and despite looking a little dazed (and being quite hungry), they looked almost exactly the way I&#8217;d last remembered them. It&#8217;s good to know some things don&#8217;t change too much. We picked up their luggage, arranged for their rental car, and headed to my apartment. (Although I had sent them instructions on how to get there, I figured it was just plain easier for me to pick them up. Long flights and detailed instructions rarely mix well.)<br />
After unceremoniously dumping their belongings at the apartment, we adjourned to Ceili&#8217;s for a late evening meal (of chicken wings and seasoned chicken bites) and beer. It was also a chance to retell old stories, catch up on new ones, and retie the old bonds that had kept us friends. If anything, it reinforced the need for me to visit with friends this year, especially those I haven&#8217;t seen for a long time.<br />
We were in bed relatively early (I was plenty tired, and they were jet lagged), and up by 8:30. Ed and Jen were parked out on the street, which expired by 9:00 &#8212; besides, they wanted to get a start on the day and get on their camping vacation. The first order of business however, was breakfast. I knew of two places not too far away that were supposedly quite good, but only one I knew of for certain &#8212; The Galaxie Diner.<br />
This is probably about as landmark as a Calgary restaurant gets. And it has, according to my breakfast cohorts, some of the best breakfasts available. You just need to get there fairly early. Something I definitely need to keep in mind for the next time people are out this way.<br />
Following breakfast was a series of trips to get provisions and supplies for Ed and Jen. Luckily, they had upgraded their car reservation the night before from a Ford Focus to Pontiac Intrigue. (Yeah, I know, &#8220;upgrade&#8221; is subjective. Simple fact: the Intrigue is bigger. Hence, more room to store all the stuff they had.) By 2:30, they had all the things they needed, had seen a bit of Calgary, and were ready to head into the mountains.<br />
I spent the rest of the day watching TV and movies. I felt a complete lack of desire to go outside.<br />
Sunday morning, met up with Kaz for dim sum. She had called me a couple days earlier interested in going for dim sum, if there was a party going. I had some difficulty raising anyone else (turned out to be a case of missing people), so it ended up just being Kaz and myself.<br />
A first note on dim sum for two: Can&#8217;t be done, especially if you know what you&#8217;re getting and have been with large groups. Both Kaz and I overate. But it was all good &#8212; I didn&#8217;t eat again until much later.<br />
Going to dim sum with Kaz was a little uncomfortable. It was just me, so I lacked the &#8220;safety in numbers&#8221;. I know this sounds strange, but look at it this way: I was out with my best friend&#8217;s fiancée, while my best friend is half-way around the world. It&#8217;s a little disconcerting, and only because I&#8217;m still getting to know her, and she&#8217;s getting to know me. But by the end, I was feeling much better &#8212; I think it&#8217;s just a case of finding ground on my own. (Previously, Chris had always been around.) One thing the dim sum did give us was a chance to talk. There were a few things Kaz needed to know, not only about Chris, but about the rest of us, too. Barring a change in plans, Kaz will become Chris&#8217; wife, and therefore someone who&#8217;ll need to know who we are.<br />
After dim sum, I wandered about downtown for a while, but ended up at home. Watching TV. And movies.<br />
Luckily, I was rescued by Stuart and Therese, who invited me over for the first barbecue of the season, and to watch the final episode of the X-Files. The three of us (and often with Chris) had watched the X-Files religiously for years &#8212; often in our parents&#8217; basements when were in Oakville, with my travelling to Guelph a few times to watch season premieres (and finales) when we were in university, and sharing stories and theories during the summer breaks. But no more, except in reruns.<br />
Today was &#8230; pretty much a nothing day. I needed to come in to work, but couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do it. I forced myself outside for a couple of hours, but soon found myself wanting to go home again. It was a warm day, but hazy &#8230; the Weather Network put it down as &#8220;smoke&#8221;, but from what I don&#8217;t know &#8212; the mountains are still thawing out.<br />
Another week is underway, and it brings me another week closer to changing my life. I, for one, can&#8217;t wait.</p>

		<blockquote><p>Maybe this is forever,<br />
Forever fades away,<br />
Like a rocket ascending into space,<br />
Could you not be sad,<br />
Could you not break down,<br />
After all I won&#8217;t let go,<br />
Until you&#8217;re safe and sound.<br />
&#8212; &#8220;Safe and Sound&#8221;, Sheryl Crow</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, a dream came true. Today, Chris left on his jet plane; destination: Narita International Airport, Japan. For the next 365 days, he&#8217;ll live in a different country, a different culture, and experience something that many of us never will.<br />
Last Thursday (9 May 2002) was Chris&#8217; first attempt. This was a bit of a false start, which we could only owe to a fair amount of miscommunication.<br />
Chris, Kaz, and I arrived at the airport just after 9:30 that morning, and wheeled Chris&#8217; copious amount of heavy luggage to the check-in counter. The clerk took Chris&#8217; ticket, and started the process to get him all set to go. However, part-way through checking him in, she noted something odd. Chris only had a one-way ticket. This prompted the following discussion:<br />
Clerk: Going to Japan?<br />
Chris: (Excitedly) Yes.<br />
Clerk: Are you going to work in Japan?<br />
Chris: Yes, I&#8217;m going to teach English.<br />
Clerk: Where&#8217;s your visa?<br />
At this point, my heart sank. I think Chris&#8217; started to, but he quickly started telling the clerk about the arrangement he had with the company. As far as Chris understood it, there was a visa with his name on it, just waiting for him in Japan. However, as the clerk knew it, Chris would not be allowed into Japan without a visa, and without a round-trip ticket he would be viewed as an immigrant, rather than a tourist. Without a work visa, Chris would be denied entry &#8230; and Air Canada would be fined $10,000 for sending someone without proper papers.<br />
Chris started making (somewhat frantic) phone calls to the Canadian branch of his company, based in Montreal. I&#8217;ve known Chris for half my life. But I have never seen him look as despondent as he did when the truth slowly started to form. It was becoming quite clear that Chris would not be going to Japan that day.<br />
Now here&#8217;s where I was really impressed. Air Canada is notorious for being the worst airline in Canada when it comes to service. Well, not only did the clerk retrieve Chris&#8217; bags (she had sent two down before realizing that there was going to be trouble), but she also managed to convert Chris&#8217; non-changeable/non-refundable ticket into a changeable ticket, where the issuing agent would &#8220;refund&#8221; the price and immediately roll it over into a round-trip open ticket.<br />
Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s *supposed* to happen: Chris is to travel to Japan with an open ticket. He can enter the country as a tourist for 90 days on a &#8220;tourist visa&#8221;. (Doesn&#8217;t actually exist, but that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s referred to as.) Once he&#8217;s in the door, he can convert his &#8220;tourist visa&#8221; into a work visa. This is the way his company operates, mostly because they get teachers on short notice, and don&#8217;t have three months to wait to clear visas from the originating country.<br />
So Chris got to spend nearly an extra week in Calgary, with his fiancée, and with his friends. After he got his new ticket, it suddenly seemed more real than it had the first time. It was almost like I knew that he wouldn&#8217;t actually leave the first time &#8212; that something would keep him here. Today, it was real. Today, I knew I would see him walk through security, and not come back.<br />
Chris, Kaz, and I arrived at the airport shortly after 9:00 (his flight to Vancouver left a half-hour earlier than the previous one). This time, checking Chris in took about 15 minutes &#8212; less than three of which were at the counter. Boarding pass in hand, all we had to do was wait.<br />
Just after 10:00, we proceeded to the gate to show Chris off. It was just the three of us. I had always imagined this giant throng of friends who would be wishing him off, causing a massive traffic jam of people. But it was just us. I think I actually preferred it that way.<br />
It was a lot easier seeing Chris off than I thought it would be. It&#8217;s probably because Chris and I know each other so well now that it really doesn&#8217;t matter where we are &#8212; halfway around the world is a short distance for people so close to each other.<br />
Chris and Kaz, on the other hand, weren&#8217;t quite as easy. I can&#8217;t blame them &#8212; deeply in love, recently engaged, and the single largest test of distance just beginning. But they&#8217;ll have others for support, and the knowledge that Chris will be coming back.<br />
I suppose the whole thing hasn&#8217;t fully hit me yet, though. I&#8217;m going to go home to what&#8217;s now just my apartment. No roommate. (Not counting the cat, that is.) No-one to talk to. No-one to laugh with. No-one to watch bad movies and rhyme off childish one-liners with.<br />
A little over two years to the day that Chris arrived here, Chris left. The day he arrived, I felt an intense anger that I was cohabitating again (I hadn&#8217;t gotten over the ex-girlfriend issues at the time). Now I can&#8217;t imagine not living with him. But I know that while he may be gone, he&#8217;s still there. And he always will be.<br />
God speed, dear friend.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ever tried to catch a thrown brick? It ain&#8217;t easy. First, you prepare for the heavy weight, which often has sharp edges, and then you try to position your body so that you can buffer the shock and try to prevent bodily harm. But in almost every case, you end up dropping it because it&#8217;s a lot heavier than you think it is.<br />
Such is what happened to me last evening. It started innoculously enough &#8212; a simple phone call from Chris. Well, &#8220;simple&#8221; in its simplest meaning, but loaded with a lot of &#8220;something big&#8221;. It went like this:<br />
Me: Hello?<br />
Chris: Hey man, what&#8217;s up? (Standard opening to a phone call for us.)<br />
Me: Not much, the usual hell of my daily life. (Standard answer to the question.)<br />
Chris: You doing anything tonight?<br />
Me: Nope. (Knowing full well that I was supposed to meet with an insurance agent, who never ended up showing.)<br />
Chris: Great! Kaz and I would like to meet you for coffee.<br />
That&#8217;s when my &#8220;Danger Will Robinson! Danger!&#8221; alarm went off. Chris has never, EVER, asked me to go for &#8220;coffee&#8221;. And if he would ask, the question would be posed as follows: &#8220;Wanna grab a coffee after work?&#8221; or something similar. The question was too formal, and loaded with the &#8220;Kaz and I&#8221;. Immediate thoughts ran through my mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kaz is pregnant.</li>
<li>Chris has decided not to go to Japan, and is moving in with Kaz.</li>
<li>Chris and Kaz got engaged.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m overreacting, and it&#8217;s nothing.</li>
<li>Kaz is going to Japan with Chris. (She&#8217;s Japanese by birth, so it&#8217;s not *that* big of a stretch.)</li>
<li>After I move to my new house, Chris is hoping I might take Kaz in as a roommate.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve eloped and are married, bought a house, and Kaz is pregnant with twins. (Like with all things I do, even my paranoia follows the adage: Go big, or go home.)</li>
</ol>
<p>These flitted through pretty quickly, and none stuck. I figured it was just Chris being a little strange because of having a new girlfriend (Chris sometimes gets like that).<br />
That evening, I ducked out shortly before 6pm and headed home. I was hoping to meet up with the building manager to try and swing a May 31st departure. But the manager I needed to talk to wasn&#8217;t in. I instead went up to the apartment for a few minutes before heading out to meet up with Chris and Kaz at the Starbuck&#8217;s on 17th Ave. (which was where I was supposed to meet the absent agent) for 7pm.<br />
Although I didn&#8217;t notice it at the time, Chris was a little &#8230; nervous. And for good reason. We took up a seat next to the fireplace, and almost immediately Chris and Kaz held out their left hands. On their ring fingers were matching (but differently sized) plain white gold rings.<br />
Number three.<br />
There are few things that will shock me. There are few things that will surprise me. There are even fewer things that will stun me so completely that for about a minute I can&#8217;t think of anything to say. I finally had to force out &#8220;My most sincere congratulations&#8221; and stifle the &#8220;Are you out of your collective minds?!&#8221;.<br />
Once we&#8217;d gotten by the uncomfortable silence that followed the &#8220;announcement&#8221; (it took a little while for it to sink in), I had to start asking questions. As one of Chris&#8217; friends, one of my responsibilities is to be his conscience, whether he likes it or not. The trick is not to ask questions that could be construed as insulting. Chris knows me well &#8212; I can ask him literally anything and he&#8217;ll understand it&#8217;s just me checking my own sanity as much as his. Kaz, on the other hand, is only just getting to know me. Having caught the dropped bomb, I now had to be careful about laying the landmines.<br />
A lot of people would sit back and suggest that they&#8217;re moving too quickly (which is a perfectly valid thought), that they haven&#8217;t thought things through, that this is inherently risky (especially since Chris is going to Japan for a year), and there is no way they could possibly know each other well enough.<br />
Any question you ask, they&#8217;ve thought of. They&#8217;ve considered it. There is no fear, no doubt, no hesitation. And above all, there is sensible thought about all of it. That was one of the first things I checked. Having been engaged in the past, I know what kind of pressures they&#8217;ll be under, and having popped the question so soon after meeting each other (about three weeks, by my count), they&#8217;ll be under way more pressure than most.<br />
Needless to say, I&#8217;m totally happy for them. I think it&#8217;s great that they were able to find each other, and able to realize very early in the relationship that this wasn&#8217;t just some iffy thing &#8212; they could see it in themselves that they were ready to be with each other for the rest of their lives. I will be lucky if I have that happen to me. I&#8217;ve seen it a couple of times before, but I guess with my own history, I&#8217;m not too optimistic for myself.<br />
So as if my anxieties about losing Chris weren&#8217;t bad enough, now he&#8217;s getting married (no plans beyond coming back from Japan, sorry). That means more isolation for myself, and the inevitable sound of little feet (though hopefully, no time soon).<br />
I&#8217;m too young for this shit.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Although it&#8217;s very tempting to say that it&#8217;s the beginning of the end &#8212; it wouldn&#8217;t really be appropriate.<br />
It&#8217;s no longer a guess, it&#8217;s not a possibility, it&#8217;s not even a plan anymore. It&#8217;s fact. Chris is going to Japan. On Thursday (9 May 2002). For an entire year, he&#8217;ll be teaching children of all ages the fine art of writing, reading, and speaking English.<br />
Be afraid. Be very afraid.<br />
Friday marked Chris&#8217; last day at Critical Mass. It was an emotional day for many people, including myself. Although it does sound a little strange that Chris and I not only work together but live together, you do need to understand that it works very well for us. We don&#8217;t see each other much around the office (we&#8217;re on different floors, different projects, and more times than not, all we get to do is nod at each other), so a lot of the time we see each other is at home, or when we&#8217;re out with friends.<br />
I&#8217;ve known Chris a very long time &#8212; now over half of my life. (I&#8217;ve known Stuart just as long, and Therese not too far off.) I&#8217;ve lived with him for two years. (In fact, Chris will be leaving just a couple days shy of his two-year anniversary in Calgary.) It&#8217;s going to be hard to not have him around.<br />
To mark his departure, we wanted to do something special. We wanted to give him something that he&#8217;d not only remember us (and I&#8217;m not referring to just Therese, Stuart, and myself &#8212; I&#8217;m referring to almost everyone he knows in Calgary), but something he&#8217;d use. Knowing that Chris will be completely overwhelmed by everything he&#8217;ll see and do while he&#8217;s in Japan, I figured the best thing was to give him a digital camera. I threw the idea out to the ABC &#8212; the &#8220;Asian Brother Crew&#8221;, who pretty much all agreed that it was the best thing going.<br />
There were two tacks that we could take &#8212; get him a cheap camera and have a small number of people, or get a good one and include a larger number of folks. Teak and I discussed this at length and decided to &#8220;go big, or go home&#8221;. (Or as my dad would say: If you&#8217;re going to do something, do it right.) So Teak gathered a small flock of people and  raised a small fortune. Although I was prepared to put in the lion&#8217;s share of the cost, I didn&#8217;t have to in the end.<br />
This wasn&#8217;t Chris&#8217; only gift from friends. Jensenne and Jeanette, with photos and blurbs from friends, made Chris a scrapbook to remember what he was leaving behind. It was a great combination of fun, goofiness, old pictures, silly pictures, and a lot of people who wanted Chris to not stay away.<br />
As for the last hurrah, we all agreed that Sakana Grill was the place. Teak made the arrangements &#8212; actually talking to the manager (it&#8217;s a lot easier to have a guy who can speak Japanese to make a reservation at a Japanese restaurant), and reserving enough places for 50+ people. This wasn&#8217;t all just for Chris, though &#8212; this was also for Nathan (in our AppDev department) and Jen (who had been filling in as our receptionist), who were also celebrating their last day at Critical Mass.<br />
We had 43 confirmations on Friday morning. There were at least 60 people when Chris, Tamara, Stuart, and myself arrived.  (Stuart is not Therese&#8217;s Stuart &#8212; this is a new co-worker who&#8217;s trying to get to know people.) We had a hard time sitting in. But we weren&#8217;t the last. We actually overflowed the area we were sitting. It was crazy.<br />
After dinner, the immense crowd broke up, and we ended up with the ABC, plus a couple of others. Plans were loosely set, mostly that Chris had to go pick up Kaz. It was decided that the bulk of the group would go to Cinescape to play video games, and we&#8217;d give them a call when we were more organized.<br />
Who&#8217;s Kaz, you ask?<br />
Kaz is short for Kazumi &#8230; and is Chris&#8217; new girlfriend.<br />
Yeah, he has a girlfriend. It&#8217;s kinda creepy how well they get along, especially considering at the time the two of them hooked up, Chris already knew he was going to Japan. (Kaz, by the way, is Japanese, and has only been in Canada for about a year.) She knew he was going to Japan. But they&#8217;re both serious about each other, to the point where they&#8217;re waiting on each other until Chris gets back a year from now.<br />
We picked Kaz up from the Petro-Canada on 4th St. (she had just come off work) and dropped her off at home. We returned to our apartment where Chris got cleaned up, I tidied the apartment, and then starting calling around to see what people were interested in. The plan ended up with everyone coming over to our apartment for video games and movies. Not particularly original, but still fun.<br />
It would be the last game/movie night in our apartment.<br />
Chris went off to retrieve Kaz as everyone started to arrive. Pretty soon, the living room was full of people yelling and screaming (due to invigorating games of Virtua Tennis). We switched to a movie a little later on, &#8220;Shaolin Soccer&#8221;, which several people hadn&#8217;t seen.<br />
The last game night ended around 2am, with everyone heading to their respective homes. Unfortunately, Chris and Kaz didn&#8217;t get back until everyone was leaving, and missed out on the festivities.<br />
Yesterday, we planned to have the whole crew go down to Chinook Paramount to watch Spider-Man, for a last group night at the movies. I tried to organize this within the span of about 20 minutes, with some degree of success, but in the end (owing to scheduling and communication problems), Chris was unable to come (he has promised to pick up Kaz after work, which conflicted with the movie time). We did luckily end up meeting for tea/coffee/dessert at Bubblemania on 16th Ave.<br />
This morning was one of the big &#8220;lasts&#8221; &#8212; the last dim sum. This was when it finally hit me. The other lasts hadn&#8217;t done anything, but this one left me really thinking about what was going to happen. Although Chris does intend to return in a year (because of Kaz), there will always be the possibility that he may never return from Japan. I had to give a moment of pause when I realized that there was the chance that this is another chapter of my life about to close.<br />
The next few days are going to be odd. They are going to be hard.<br />
But not as hard as the ones that will follow.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>It&#8217;s official, Mother Nature is bipolar.<br />
North America has been receiving some very erratic weather as of late. Out here, it&#8217;s been a little more consistent than erratic &#8230; consistently bad, that is.<br />
So far this year, we&#8217;ve had about two warm days. Luckily, both on weekends. But here we are, a month into spring, and I&#8217;m still hauling out my winter jacket. Two months ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have cared about that. Those of you who know me reasonably well know that I rather like winter. I like snow. I even like the mind-numbing cold &#8230; for short periods of time, anyway.<br />
But this weather truly sucks.<br />
Take yesterday, for example. I was waiting around for an insurance agent to call. (I&#8217;m looking around for quotes on mortgage insurance, as well as new house insurance. Although this particular agent is more of a favour for a friend, so I don&#8217;t know if it will go anywhere at all.) I was fiddling around with one of my own personal websites when my phone rang. It was Joanne (the agent). She asked me why I was still at work. I asked if we were still meeting (yeah, I know, you should never answer a question with a question, but it was a lead-in for an answer I never got to give). She said it was snowing.<br />
I looked out the window. Overcast, yes. Snow, no.<br />
Snowing? I asked. Yep &#8212; lots of it in the South East. I work in the South East. (Well, barely, anyway.) But there was no snow that I could see. But apparently the weather was getting really miserable. Joanne suggested we hold off until next week. (It was better for her, anyway.) I agreed, and figured I should head out &#8212; I hadn&#8217;t brought a winter jacket, and it sounded like it was going to get really cold.<br />
I took the C-Train &#8212; the wind was just chilly enough to make walking uncomfortable in the jacket I had. In hindsight, it was the best thing I could have done. No more than five minutes after I&#8217;d returned to my apartment did I happen to notice something. I couldn&#8217;t see buildings a block away. It was snowing. Hard. We were having a blizzard.<br />
It&#8217;s Spring. Or at least it&#8217;s supposed to be Spring. But this weather would make you really wonder what month it is. Were it not for the fact that it gets dark much later in the evening, you&#8217;d almost swear it was December. And even if the groundhog did see his shadow, we should be well in the clear by now.<br />
Spring never sprung here &#8212; it&#8217;s still frozen stuck.<br />
This is going to be a bit of an odd year for weather, I think. I&#8217;m not sure if this is an effect of El Nino (supposedly back on the rise again) or of global warming (which really isn&#8217;t proving itself out here). We&#8217;re probably going to see a cooler west, a hotter and more humid south (we should probably expect a Class 5 hurricane), and probably a few more violent weather shifts across the continent. Heck, we might even see a tornado around Cowtown.<br />
So if you see good weather this year, get out in it while you can. If you blink, you might miss it&#8230;</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>There are times when I hate owning a car.<br />
My car&#8217;s been having problems this winter. We had a really cold one &#8212; from late December through to just a week or so ago, we were having some really nasty cold snaps. Seeing -20 on the thermometer became a regular occurrance. Seeing -30 was far more frequent than we would have liked, one we had the fortune of repeating a several times.<br />
My car has been through cold weather before &#8212; Waterloo and Ottawa for a couple of winters, during one of which I had trouble starting the engine (the injectors froze, I think). But I&#8217;d never really thought too much about getting a block heater to aid starting the engine when it was cold. Normally it wasn&#8217;t an issue, and if the engine was left to warm up a bit, ran just fine.<br />
This winter brought my lack of a block heater to a head, though. Except that I didn&#8217;t get one installed. I hesitated, procrastinated, forgot, and avoided all winter. Why? Simple &#8212; Chris and I don&#8217;t drive very much. And when we do, it&#8217;s almost as likely to get a ride from our friends than it is for us to drive. Also, living in Calgary means that you also get chinooks, which is coincidentally when we managed to get the car started.<br />
But not the week I had to go home to Oakville for my father&#8217;s funeral. (Uh&#8230; I just realized that some of you don&#8217;t know this &#8212; I haven&#8217;t sent a log entry about it. [[Death of David Charles Sowrey|My father passed away on March 7th]], after fighting off various cancers for the past year. Needless to say, it&#8217;s been a tough year for my family.)<br />
Anyway, that week in Calgary was cold, and regularly in the low negative 20s. Chris tried to start my car a couple of times, for a variety of reasons/needs, but was unable as the engine was too cold. The battery wasn&#8217;t strong enough to power the starter to get the engine to turn over. So the car just sat in the garage, and waited for our return.<br />
Yes, I was kicking myself for not getting a block heater. The last month was quite cold, and the car never started once. The battery finally dropped to the point where starting the engine, even if it was hot, was an impossibility. This necessitated a jump from someone, so I could get the car somewhere.<br />
This really became a problem though, because I haven&#8217;t exactly been the most organized person in the last little while. (For obvious reasons I need not elaborate on.) Luckily for me, there was a solution: the AMA. No, not the American Medical Association &#8212; the Alberta Motor Association. The local incarnation of CAA. Little beknownst to me, I&#8217;ve had a CAA membership for several years now &#8230; courtesy of my mother, who had not only myself, but also my sister tacked onto her membership.<br />
The things you learn at Easter dinner.<br />
Armed with the number, I finally decided on Saturday to give the AMA a buzz and get my car up and running again. After an hour wait (the AMA is overworked in this city), a Battery Assist (AMA&#8217;s jump service) truck showed up at my apartment. It was a (relatively) warm day &#8212; peeking above zero for the first time in weeks. It was a perfect day to spend more money to fix my car again.<br />
The first big hurdle was just getting the truck to my car. The Battery Assist truck is a heavy-duty 1/2 ton, which sits high as a result of its undercarriage. The service guy (whose name escapes me, unfortunately) drove hanging onto the steering wheel while hanging out the door, making sure his roof didn&#8217;t get caught on the concrete ceiling. (Apparently, his partner got stuck in a parking garage the week before, and had to let the air out of his tires to get the truck out.)<br />
He barely made it onto Level 3.<br />
We popped the hood on my car, and he slapped on his testing gizmo to check my battery. It&#8217;s a little more advanced than my AA battery tester. Among several functions, it can also tell what the Cold Cranking Amps are. (This, apparently, is a measure of how well your battery can start an engine.) My battery read 62. You need a minimum of 160, or something like that. In short, a jump would only get me going. The battery, for all intents and purposes, was dead.<br />
Ironically enough, this was what I had planned to do anyway &#8212; replace the battery. I&#8217;d figured it was past its due date, and was high time to get a new one. The news from the AMA guy just reinforced that a bit. I muttered a bit about how this probably wouldn&#8217;t have been such a big deal if I&#8217;d bucked down and got the block heater. The AMA guy agreed, suggesting that it should be something I might want to look into for next winter.<br />
I was offered the opportunity to get my battery replaced by the AMA. For the same price of a Canadian Tire battery, but without the mandatory installation and testing fees that they charge to warranty the battery. I suppose I could have gone to Costco, but if I&#8217;d shut the engine off, I&#8217;d need another jump to move the car again. And considering I&#8217;d get roadside assistance if anything happened, this just seemed like a good deal.<br />
The tech got to work, whipping out his tools and preparing to change my battery. Wonder why he drove a heavy-duty half-ton truck? The back&#8217;s full of batteries, old and new. (He never needs to worry about traction in the winter, that&#8217;s for sure!)<br />
I think the battery was original, or at the very least hadn&#8217;t been changed since I got the car. Either way, it wasn&#8217;t easy to remove it. The battery cables were stiff and the nuts didn&#8217;t loosen easily, the bolt that held the battery in place was almost rusted shut and was very difficult to move, and the block heater cord kept getting in the way&#8230;<br />
&#8230;block heater cord? What block heater cord?<br />
Much to my surprise, delight, and utter dismay, the tech held out a cord that looked suspiciously like it was attached to a block heater. He followed it down until it disappeared into the engine block. There&#8217;s only one thing I know of that comes out of an engine block that requires a standard three-prong cord.<br />
All you can do at a time like that is laugh. Which is good, because if you can&#8217;t laugh at yourself, then you don&#8217;t have license to laugh at anyone else.<br />
The battery swapped, tested, and warrantied, I proceeded to go for a drive an ensure all was well. So far, the car&#8217;s running better. I guess the cost was worth it &#8212; my transportation actually transports again. I even got it cleaned to get the last couple of month&#8217;s dirt and dust off (it collects very easily in our parking garage). Of course, it started snowing again that evening.<br />
I hope it really warms up soon. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll have to plug in the block heater.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Third year running: Lots of family, lots of activity, and way too much food.<br />
This year&#8217;s events started Thursday evening, when my mother arrived from Ontario, as did Chris&#8217; parents for their first (and possibly only) visit with Chris in Calgary.<br />
(A side note on that: Chris is still planning to go to Japan. The question is when. At this point, he&#8217;s still in the interview process with the company, who has suggested that they are sending four people in April. Yes, it&#8217;s now April, and we have no idea what&#8217;s going on. I&#8217;m pretty sure that this is inevitable, it&#8217;s just when the ball finally gets rolling.)<br />
So, back to family.<br />
I didn&#8217;t see my mother, Nana, or the Mays until the following day. (I went to an antique show at the Roundup Centre, looking for a dining room table. Without success, I might add.) Friday morning, I stumbled from bed to find Mr. and Mrs. May watching TV. They and Chris had plans (I&#8217;m not sure what), as did I &#8212; I was to go out with my family for an excursion to beautiful Cochrane.<br />
For those of you who know Cochrane, you may now laugh at the joke. For those of you who haven&#8217;t, consider yourself lucky.<br />
Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t be that harsh &#8212; Cochrane isn&#8217;t that bad. If you know what you want, it&#8217;s quite pleasant. But the weather wasn&#8217;t quite cooperative, and the wait for lunch (although tasty), was a little too long for some of us.<br />
After lunch, we wandered about the &#8220;main drag&#8221; (about three blocks) for a little while, perusing the various wares in the touristy stores, before deciding it was high time to get the heck outta Dodge.<br />
That brought us to, quite logically, Bragg Creek. We didn&#8217;t stay there too long, either, about long enough to pick up some candles for Nana, and for Jen to fall asleep in the rear of the van. Mike joined her there on our way back to Calgary. That night, we had dinner at my aunt and uncle&#8217;s.<br />
Saturday was the great party. This was the family get together that has now become a tradition &#8212; this is the third year running (for me, anyway). My day started off rather by searching for antiques in Inglewood (specifically, the aforementioned table). This was a rather futile effort, unfortunately &#8212; Inglewood has become so trendy that most of the antique stores cater to the trendy types, and don&#8217;t carry the kinds of things I was looking for. Or, if they do, are far overpriced and the storekeeps are rather anal about people touching the things they want to buy.<br />
On my way back, I stopped into the Cellar (a wine shop downtown) to pick up beverages for the evening&#8217;s repast. All I knew was the main course: salmon wrapped in phyllo pastry. But that was enough for the staff to help me purchase a rather large quantity of wines. I hoped it would support the large number of guests.<br />
Now, you&#8217;re probably wondering what the deal is with the salmon. Last year (see [[Easter with my family, friends]]), we overdid ourselves at Bodega. After learning of the damage inflicted on Ryan&#8217;s credit card (some of us were not given the opportunity to pitch in), the decision was made to tone it down a bit, and have the meal at Pam&#8217;s house, and hire in a caterer. Luckily, Aunt Brenda knows of one through her guiding efforts.<br />
Now Darryl (which I believe is his name) isn&#8217;t some hoity-toity kind of chef. He&#8217;s a down-to-earth chef who believes in talking with the people who are going to eat his meals. And he doesn&#8217;t mind and endless set of questions about how he made his food. Mostly because it was really good.<br />
Of note in particular was the salmon. He took (rather large) portions of salmon, wrapped them in phyllo pastry with onions, carrots, and a bit of dill, and baked it in the oven until the pastry was nicely browned. In my life, so far anyway, I&#8217;ve had three outstanding salmon dishes: The Pacific Starlight in 1998 (see [[My first birthday in Vancouver, Trip on the Pacific Starlight, Porteau Cove]]), the Royal Hudson in 1999 (see [[BC Rail Royal Hudson 2860, West Coast Railway Association, Comox Airshow, and Skyhawks]]), and this salmon dish at Pam&#8217;s house. I had to go back for seconds. (Which, luckily for me, I could.)<br />
Suffice to say, I overate.<br />
The following dinner wasn&#8217;t much better. This time, Chris, his parents, and I traipsed up to the northeast, to my aunt and uncle&#8217;s home. There, again, we gorged ourselves on whatever we could get our hands on. In this case, it was turkey, one of my favourite meals. And as before, I ate far too much. I would have eaten more were it not for one itty bitty little thing:<br />
We were having a blizzard.<br />
Calgary&#8217;s weather is strange. Chris swears that the next forecast will be for locusts. (We&#8217;ve had almost everything else except the waters turning to blood.) It was into the low teens yesterday around noon, was approaching zero when we left for my relative&#8217;s, was snowing by the time we got off the train, and was full-force blizzard by 8:00pm.<br />
I love this city.<br />
Easter (and the dinners to end all dinners) finally ends tonight: A meal at Silver Dragon, where Chris&#8217; parents get the unenviable pleasure of meeting all of Chris&#8217; friends. (After this, they won&#8217;t want to come back to Calgary again.)<br />
Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to waddle home afterwards.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The following was the eulogy read out at my father&#8217;s funeral. It was written by one of our closest family friends, Mrs. Claudette Robinson, who also did the reading.</p>
<blockquote><p>David was a multi-talented man.  What was his calling?  Hmmm&#8230;let me see now&#8230;<br />
Well, David was a salesman, a carpenter, or more precisely a cabinet-maker, a handyman, a poet, an architect, an engineer, an electrician, an auto mechanic, a painter, a plumber, a gardener, a boater, a traveler, a cook, a conversationalist, a connoisseur of impeccable scotch, (although he was fond of saying, how he had long ago given up on quality &#8230;it was quantity that mattered now&#8230;) an animal lover, a lover of classical music, and as we all know&#8230;an incredible host and a friend to all of us here and oh my&#8230; if you were a friend in need&#8230;was he ever a friend in deed! I would like to expand against this background.<br />
<strong>David the Salesman:</strong><br />
When it came to heavy equipment David was a superb salesman. Not only did he sell equipment, he followed up on all his sales to make sure the equipment was functioning properly and those of us that knew his love of heavy machinery always suspected that he was also making sure that his beloved machines were properly maintained with 15W40 and not abused in any way. David practically adopted all his customers and became indispensable to them. I was just driving by he would say to his customers and thought I would drop in and &#8230; by the way&#8230;when was the last time you changed the oil on that sucker uh?<br />
<strong>David the Cabinet Maker:</strong><br />
The Sowrey&#8217;s residence is material proof of David&#8217;s prowess as a carpenter&#8230; witness the kitchen cupboards, the bay windows, the oak floors, the oak railing, the deck, the wine rack, the greenhouse, the stairs, the new washroom, the built in furniture in Geoff and Cathy&#8217;s room, the kitchen table, the tile countertops the made to measure bar drawer with special heavy duty sliders&#8230;to name but a few. The sauna has remained to this day, an unfinished project something unusual for David. I personally suspect that after a few years of waiting for its completion Linda finally decided to store all her files in this space and this, in my mind, prompted David to decide (and you will have to excuse me here for wanting to quote him precisely) To Fuck the sauna!<br />
David was a perfectionist who paid great attention to details and showed incredible patience when working on a project. He did not enjoy working alone and his most faithful gopher a.k.a. Linda was always there to fetch a tool for him or as she would say: in case he needs another pair of hands. Time meant nothing to David when he started on something nor did lunch hour and I must admit that occasionally Linda was seen rolling her eyes and shaking her head (she was probably starving!) to which David&#8217;s typical response would be: Now Linda&#8230;don&#8217;t get your tit in the wringer!<br />
This expression that he loved to use was always accepted with a grin except the one time that David (perhaps under the influence, but I &#8216;m not sure of that&#8230;) made and error in judgment and used it on his very proper Scottish mother Bea&#8230;<br />
Oh my!  If looks could kill we would have lost David on that very day many years ago.<br />
<strong>David the Electrician:</strong><br />
Electricity fascinated David and he could wire anything! Pot lights, spotlights, central vacuums, stoves, appliances, speakers, anything in fact under 1200 volts. Some of his less capable friends, jealous no doubt of his multi skills, actually blamed his mid winter tan (noticed on his hands and face only) to a jolting experience. This by the way has never been confirmed and I personally find it shocking (if you will excuse the pun) that someone would even think of this&#8230;sheeesh&#8230;his hair never even sprung curls &#8230;to my knowledge (as David would say).<br />
<strong>David the Painter:</strong><br />
David could paint anything and wallpaper anything as well. That was the easy part, what he did in preparation however was something else and being his helper required the patience of Job, those walls were so clean &#8230;thank you TSP that it hardly seemed necessary to paint them when he was through with the preparation. He did the cutting out&#8230;the rolling, and the cleaning of all equipment afterwards. I did notice though that when putting up wallpaper, the plumb lines were not as straight at the end of the day as they had been at the beginning&#8230;. Hmmm I am not a hundred percent sure (as David would say) what to attribute that too.<br />
<strong>David the Poet:</strong><br />
It seems to me that David was one of those rare persons whose both sides of the brain worked equally well. Not only was David brilliant at math and figures and conversions but he was also very artistic (a trait he undoubtedly inherited from his dad). If the mood struck him, David could whip up a poem at a moment&#8217;s notice witness his earlier Xmas letters and he could pen a fine letter &#8220;to boot&#8221; as he would say and did I mention his calligraphy skills? And so on and so forth&#8230;again as David was fond of saying&#8230;<br />
<strong>David the Gardener:</strong><br />
David embraced gardening with his usual enthusiasm and the green house, first ours, and then theirs, opened a new world to him. He had the patience, not to mention the moral fortitude to plant with the help of tweezers over a million individual seeds every year. This whole process began in January and continued until the 24th of May weekend. This period, by the way, was noted as being very beneficial to LCBO stores and to DuMaurier stockholders as David spent an incredible amount of time nurturing his plants and watching them grow as he sipped his scotch and enjoyed a smoke.<br />
<strong>David the Car Lover:</strong><br />
The Wheel&#8217;s section of the Star was David&#8217;s favourite reading of the week and with his incredible memory he would, over a few drinks of scotch or a beer,or a cognac relate to Don all the new things happening in the car industry. He loved cars and owned so many of them over the years that when I inquired from his family for a list of his cars (my guestimate is that he had over 20 of them in his lifetime) they told me it would be easier rather than to list them to just mention that he never owned a Volvo &#8230;He looked after his car as a treasured and valued possession a quality he passed on to Geoff and Cathy when they became car owners&#8230;You change your oil every 6 months or 5000 kilometers and only use 15W40&#8230;That&#8217;s what they use in back hoes and they work so warm it up for 20 minutes in the winter&#8230; For Christ sake!<br />
[Ed. Note: Actually, Dad *did* own a Volvo. If that&#8217;s not an indication of how many cars he owned, I don&#8217;t know what is.]<br />
David not only loved cars but also loved driving and his favourite retirement plan was to travel to a warmer southern location and find an RV park. When I inquired as to what he did once he got there he responded: Oh&#8230; just shoot the shit with the old farts&#8230;<br />
<strong>David the Boater:</strong><br />
David was in his element on the water. He loved it! He loved boating and owned two large boats, namely Mamicat and Calvados. With his usual generous invitations to friends to come on board and have a few, he once again maintained a buoyant economy for Canada all through his boat ownership years.<br />
<strong>David the Animal Lover:</strong><br />
David had a soft spot in his heart for all animals and in his lifetime he owned 3 pussy cats, 4 dogs and for the last few years a granddog: Bear. He gave them treats, brushed them, washed them and talked to them, loved them and disciplined them: No Puss Puss, you can&#8217;t have your dinner! It&#8217;s not 4:30 yet! This discipline however was not applied to friends when they dropped by in the morning. David would in his usual inviting way say: Sit down dammit and have a drink! But it&#8217;s only 10 o&#8217;clock David&#8230;Well it&#8217;s past noon in Newfoundland! Now do you want Rimmer or not?<br />
<strong>David the Conversationalist:</strong><br />
David could talk to anybody on any subject especially from an historical viewpoint. His most animated conversations were on politics and politicians most of whom he had limited regard for&#8230; He was fond of saying: They couldn&#8217;t organize a pissup in a brewery for Christ sake!<br />
David had a colorful way with language and if you will indulge me for a few more seconds, I would like to share or remind you of some Davidisms (to coin a word): These are direct quotes and were such a part of David that none of us will ever hear these again without being reminded of him. My apologies if anyone is offended by them&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Well&#8230;To be brutally honest&#8230;I don&#8217;t give a damn!</li>
<li>Hmmmm&#8230;. I&#8217;m not a hundred percent sure of that&#8230;</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t give a sweet rat&#8217;s ass!</li>
<li>If my memory serves me right&#8230;</li>
<li>In a pig&#8217;s arse!</li>
</ul>
<p>And his all time favourite:<br />
Oh fuck that! Let&#8217;s have a drink!<br />
In closing, we will remember David mostly as the generous, kind, giving, helpful, friend that he was to all of us. I doubt that any friend oh his in this room did not receive his help at one time or another&#8230;<br />
Obviously I have missed some things, but as David was prone to say when he felt that you already knew the end of his story:<br />
Tra la tra la tra la&#8230;.</p></blockquote>

		<p>If you had told me that I would one day dread hearing the tune to Auld Lang Syne at five o&#8217;clock in the morning, I&#8217;d have thought you crazy.<br />
But like many things that I thought not possible, this is precisely what happened.<br />
Early on the 15th of February, Dad suffered a stroke, a result (assumedly) of his brain tumour. This put his health more into question, and bought me to Oakville on the 20th. I visited with my family, and tried to spend time with my father.<br />
I didn&#8217;t sleep well while I was at home. But upon returning to Calgary, I slept considerably worse. At first, I assume it was because of a cold that I had developed while in Oakville. But things didn&#8217;t get much better after the cold had cleared up.<br />
This morning, I realized why I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I was expecting a phone call. &#8220;The call.&#8221; My cell phone is programmed to play the tune to Auld Lang Syne when it received a call from my parent&#8217;s phone number. That is precisely what happened at 5:14:53am MST. It was Cathy. There was only one reason why she&#8217;d call at that time.<br />
David Charles Sowrey passed away this morning, finally succumbing to the cancer which had spread though his body. My father is gone.<br />
I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s hit me yet. Aside from some heartfelt best wishes, it&#8217;s been &#8230; easy. But I&#8217;m probably still a little numb, and I haven&#8217;t been home yet.<br />
Well, I haven&#8217;t been to Oakville yet. I can&#8217;t go &#8220;home&#8221; anymore. Home doesn&#8217;t exist anymore &#8212; not like it used to be. My father is dead, and with him dies my sense of &#8220;home&#8221;.<br />
It is only one of many changes to come this year. It&#8217;s by far one of the largest, and of the most significant. But it&#8217;s a welcome change. At least now Dad can rest &#8212; his pain is gone, his worries ended. And Mom and Cathy can try to get back to their lives &#8212; once they&#8217;ve &#8230; once we&#8217;ve recovered from the loss.<br />
I cannot say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe in them when someone is that close to you. His memory and spirit will live on, and will be a part of me for the rest of my life. I will not say goodbye, for I will never give him up.<br />
May you rest in peace, dear father. Find in death the peace you could not have in life.</p>

		<p>I hate being sick.<br />
When I arrived here, I had a sore throat. I had thought i was because of a lack of water or fluids while in transit. It was, however, the beginnings of my first cold in a year. It&#8217;s more annoying than debilitating, but I still wish I didn&#8217;t have it.<br />
I partially blame Mom, Cathy, and Dad &#8212; their cigarette smoke has done a number on my immune system, and probably opened me up to a cold I probably wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise caught.<br />
But I do have to keep perspective &#8212; it&#8217;s nothing like what Dad&#8217;s going through.<br />
Dad&#8217;s doing well, all things considered. He&#8217;s a little slower than usual, but it&#8217;s probably due to the morphine we&#8217;ve got him on. His wits are still about him, but admittedly he still doesn&#8217;t realize he&#8217;s at home, despite another trip into the living room. They&#8217;ll try again tomorrow to convince him of his whereabouts.<br />
I however will not be here. I&#8217;m going back to Calgary. Because Dad&#8217;s condition is much better than i think we could have hoped, I&#8217;m going to return to my daily grind, until events warrant. That could be days, it could be months. Frankly, we don&#8217;t know. He has good days, he has not so good days. It&#8217;s all pretty hard to tell.<br />
I hate to leave this in Mom and Cathy&#8217;s hands. It&#8217;s a huge burden. We should share a a family. But what do you do? I have a job I can&#8217;t neglect ad a house that I&#8217;ll soon have to pay for. I love my family and would be here every second, but there are just some things I cannot do.<br />
Although I cannot compare myself directly to Dad, I hate the feeling of helplessness &#8212; knowing that there is nothing you can do, and all there is to do is wait.<br />
Cathy has been the star through all this. I&#8217;ll have to make a point to reward her for all her sacrifices and for all the pain that she&#8217;s borne for the rest of us. If anything, it will make her an excellent manager, and an unbelievable mother.<br />
But for now, we&#8217;ll just keep on living, helping out where we can, supporting each other (and Dad), and by the family we are.</p>
